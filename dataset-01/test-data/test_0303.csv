1,So sad for a Sangean,"I've had and have some great portable Sangean radios. This is truly an anomaly.Hire a computer guru to read the book to set it up. No kidding. I assumed that I would get a great HD signal in West LA. NOPE. This is the most expensive, poor signal radio I can imagine buying.Oh Well. Maybe I will move to Alaska and it will work better there, I still have the book. Remember the flashing 12:00 on the VCRs, same thing here."
1,Not so happy customer,"I returned the first radio because it turned itself off. The second radio worked well for the first couple of weeks and began turning itself off. When I contacted the company I was told, Too bad, you're out of time. So I have a radio that works well outside. I live in southwestern Pennsylvania. Outdoor radio listening is limited to June thru September. The rest of the year the HD radio is a basement decoration...silent until spring."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this radio because our favorite smooth-jazz station became a hip-hop station, and we learned that the smooth jazz programming was available on the secondary digital channel. However, we could not get the second channel to work with any consistency. It worked in the kitchen, but not in the bedroom, where we had intended to use it. Another reviewer has commented on the user-unfriendly setup process, and I second those comments totally. But the deal-killer for me is that it just can't pull in the stations. I tried everything. It just doesn't work very well at all.We live in suburban Dallas.I'm sending it back. I NEVER send stuff back, but this was really unsatisfactory."
1,Esoterica Fade Cream does NOT work,"This item did not work, it didn't lighten my skin at all. I would not buy this product again. Waste of money."
2,Do your research.,"Before you buy this, I highly recommend you do some research on its active ingredient, hydroquinone. Although the FDA claims there is insufficent evidence to link hydroquinone to cancer, Japan, the European Union, and Australia have already banned it from their products.Just be safe, and make an educated descision."
2,Inaccurate,I was in Boston-- the old west end-- in 1963.. Well where was this Landay guy??? Sure this is fiction but shouldnt the facts of what was happening in the city at the time be historically accurateWas a turn off for me
3,Reliving the terror that gripped Boston,"Captured the fear that gripped Boston at the time. Landay does a good job in showing the conflict within the polce department to meet the needs of the public to believe they are now safe and the reality that the police do not accept the one strangler concept. Because the author is using a real situation as his backdrop, the characters deveploment is not as strong as some of his other books. A very good read especially for those who remember that time in Boston."
2,Ultimately a disappointment,"This book was definitely a page-turner, but in the end I neither liked nor cared about any of the characters."
2,Couldn't screw it.,"I bought this for a trip to see my grandchildren, but as I was setting it up, I found the set-screw was missing for the antenna shaft. Not having time to ""screw"" with it, I got it set up on my meter, as close as I could, and epoxied it together - which made it partially usable, but un-returnable. I expect mine was a fluke, but that's the breaks, for me and the seller."
5,Beautiful sequel to Mountain Born,"Beautifully written story of a young man coming of age. Elizabeth Yates' style of writing is class containing gorgeous descriptions and an engaging story. If you have read Mountain Born and enjoyed it as much as our family did, then this is a great addition to any family library. Highly recommend!"
2,Embarrassing view of us Welsh...,"I live in Swansea, the city where this movie was made and I was horrified by the way we were dipicted. We all don't speak with unintelligable accents (some do of course as do Americans, Australians etc)but it's just a movie... There are flashes of humour but the excessive use of the ""F"" word is a bit embarrassing. As for Leonard Maltin the guy that revies the films, Swansea is not a fringe part of the UK......Haydn Lloyd"
3,I expected this to be a great movie.,I found this movie very disapointing and confusing. I watched it several times and still are not sure I really got it! Somehow I missed the point. I expected it to be very good from the title and movie description of what it was about. I thought sometimes the characters earnestness in being who they truly were was very strong and very realistic. Some behaviour in the film Im still questioning were they trying to show how homophobic people can be or was the movie this superficial. I could have passed this movie by and not missed any greatness. Sort of interesting but not a must see. But having said all that definately a must consider idea if there is to be humanity in the world.
3,Good book for mature readers,"The information is now dated since the housing crisis.However, some chapters are very informative.The book itself is in very good condition, for the price."
4,fire bad,"mesmerizing and great. I fell for this movie because the story was interesting, people, arsonists, setting fires and Liotta and Leguizamo have to find out who is doing this. from start to finish its grand and well directed. for fans of the 2 stars or who like fire movies. based on actual events"
1,Did Not Grab Me At All,"I like Richard K. Morgan, Gibson, Stephenson and Sterling. I thought this might be in a similar genre. Anyone who read Gibson, Diamond Age, Crytonomicon, etc. knows the prose can meander. I bought Air, read a few chapters, and was not interested in the slightest. I was expecting something that either rated higher on the profundity scale or cranked along plotwise. I bought it based on so many good reviews. Your mileage may vary."
2,A disappointment,"I'd looked forward to this book for a long time, but now that it's here, I'm not so sure I'm going to get rid of my Burt and Grossenheider. My current favorites among the Rodentia--packrats and grasshopper mice--are painted so badly here as to be unrecognizable, as biologically accurate as Du""rer's rhinoceros but without anything like the artistic interest. What's really disappointing, though, is that with this book available, I can't imagine another mammal guide appearing for years to come."
5,HELP ME! I CAN'T STOP!,"Seriously! Since I purchased Spklanng, it hasn't left my car stereo. My husband is ready to... me!It's a crazy infectious CD and I can't stop. I LOVE The Supers!!!"
1,Aqua Alta (Audio Book),"I have listened with appreciation to five of Donna Leon's Commissario Brunetti novels. Now I have come to Aqua Alto and sadly must give an emphatic thumbs down! This negative review is not because of the gay advocacy theme, which IMO is an interesting and credible commentary. The negativity comes from the atrocious Blackstone Audiobooks production which used some untrained 19-yr-old American English speaker for Brunetti and other male voices. The male readings are a disaster and a violation of the author's work. In the context of the gay advocacy theme, the crude lack of artistry of the male voices turns the gay advocacy into mockery and polemic - not the author's intention I assume."
2,First Read of this Author,I heard an interview by this author in radio so thought I'd see if I would like her. Disappointing read. Slow moving and predictable.
4,Keep them coming,Donna Leon creates wonderful entertaining novels featuring the lovable Commissario Guido Brunetti. This novel like the others in the series is set against the endearing backdrop of Venice and gives futher insights into Guido's family and his struggles with 'the system'.
4,"Ecuadorian ""Escudos"" ?!",Enjoyable as usual but I was surprised to see that her research came up with the escudo as the currency of Ecuador. It was the sucre but today the dollar and never the escudo.
5,Donna Leon fans should rush to Amazon.co.uk!,"""Aqua Alta"" is another splendid, can't-put-it-down engagement with Guido Brunetti. I despaired of reading any more of Donna Leon's fine prose and carefully crafted plots when notified last year that publication had been cancelled of a forthcoming book. Led by a note in another review, I checked out Amazon.co.uk, where I found ""Death of Faith,"" ""A Noble Radiance,"" and the book I just finished, ""Fatal Remedies."" Each is as good or better than its predecessor. I remain a dedicated fan. (Be aware, ""The Anonymous Venetian"" was published in the US with the title ""Dressed for Death."") Also, some of Leon's works that are out-of-print in the US are available in the UK."
4,Pleasant time passer: 3.5 stars,"This is one of many free books I've picked up on my Kindle, although it's no longer free.This one, like many of them, is the first in a series. The idea is to hook you in so you'll buy the others. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.For me, this one dose of Mossy Creek is enough. They're pleasant enough, the people of Mossy Creek, but quickly forgettable, and with so many truly great books out there, why spend money on a series I know to be middling?If you enjoy the small town, ""everyone knows your business"" kind of atmosphere in a book, this one may be just your speed. The revolving cast of characters will either make your head spin or keep you fully engaged with Mossy Creek. I enjoyed the book, and wouldn't have been upset to pay $7 for it, but I won't be picking up the sequels."
4,Very entertaining - looking for more...,Very nice collection of short stories woven together - very good collection of characters. This was free on Kindle at one point and I am so glad I had the opportunity to read it!
3,Meh,"Certain parts of it were funny and heartwarming, but overall I found it boring. At times I got too aggravated by the characters and had to put it down. I probably wouldn't read it again. I might read one or two of the sequels, but only if I had nothing better to do."
5,Very sweet,I love this book. I bought it because of the illustrator. Even though my son is 2.5 I still love reading this one to him. A great addition to any bookshelf.
5,the story told thru its pictures,"This two-volume work is the monumental collection of pictures of the american civil war. In total approx. 1800 pages shows us the soldiers from privates to generals and pictures from the battlefield, taken just a few hours after bitter fighting took place. The pictures also covers the citys and houses as well as other important place like rivers, harbours or mountains. The pictural record is accompaigned by text, written by important scholars. Originally six parts, the editors made two volumes of this work, which is highly recommended for any civil war buff, who wishes to see, what he's reading about."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, that this has to be one of the worst produced albums I have every heard. This albums sound quality reminds me of a poorly recorded demo album. I am not sure what Yngwie was thinking releasing the album produced so poorly. The guitars and vocals are drowned out by the thumping bass and drums. It is no wonder the vocalist left the day before the album was released.The production is so bad, that after a few listens, I am still unable to determine if the album contains anything worthwhile. I feel that Yngwie needs to take a long look at his music and consider taking some time off to regroup. He should look hard to find a quality singer (and try to maintain a professional relationship with him).If you are looking for a great Yngwie album go out and get Oddessy."
5,Excellent but not worth it,"It is the same as the european edition, except that it has two tracks instead of Black Sheep of the Family. The pick isn't included.It is better to buy the other edition, cheaper and quite the same"
3,War to End All Redundancy,"Don't get me wrong, I bought this CD and am listening to it as I write this review. I have been a die hard Malmsteen fan since I first heard him in Alcatraz. I have continued to follow his progress to this very day. I do have two points of contension, however. FIRST This CD is really a rehash of previous work. Most of the melodies as well as most of the solo's can be found in earlier works. SECOND While Yngwie is a brilliant guitar player, he should NOT be allowed to write his own lyrics. This has been the only real problem that I have had to overlook in his music. The lyrics are really quite lame. Sorry Yngwie."
1,Amazon Misrepresentation!,"Very deceptive. I bought it because the product is labeled as 26-Ounce Stainless-Steel Espresso Maker, all true except that it's not 26 ounce! It's 18 ounce. It's a 9 demitasse size pot, which in Italian Espresso measurement a demitasse is 2 ounce.Plus I agree with the previous reviewer this is horribly poor design. The column where the pressurized coffee would rise is so close to the hinged lid that the coffee blow the lid open during brewing. So forcefully did it blow that there's coffee stain every where after I brewed coffee.I too am returning this to Amazon."
1,Visually beautiful but poorly designed.,"I was very eager to receive this stainless steel espresso maker because it is so beautiful to look at and made of stainless steel. The traditional stove top espresso makers are made of aluminum, which I don't care for.This espresso maker, however, is a huge disappointment and I'm returning it to Amazon. The stem inside the upper chamber which allows the coffee to percolate up is so close to the lid that the lid lifts and hot coffee splatters everywhere. This is also a design flaw of the lid which is too light to contain the coffee under pressure. What a mess to clean up. Additional, the noise of the chattering lifting lid was too much!On the plus side, it is gorgeous to look at and if you want to ornament your kitchen with a useless but impressive ""looking"" item, this might be of interest to you."
1,Useless,This is a reprint of a book that was published in 1906. It is very poor. The usual scholarly conventions eg footnotes are non existent. Don't waste your money.
5,#1 club song of the year!!!!!!,"Now this song is the reason why people should go to clubs... As a dj I play this song when the crowd is getting tierd, it seems like it pumps people up, when I saw judge jules live, he played it, and it was the first time I had heared this song, it made the club go crazy... Every one started to jump up and down. yelling and screaming, the song has a wiered effect to it, it makes you want to poor out all your emotions, kind of makes you feel like superman. I sugest that if you do get this cd that you won't drive and listen to this song. I garntee that you will pull over get out of your car and throw your hands up in the air....Now for lightforce, this is there best single yet and I can't wait till thier whole cd comes out, it is going to be something to be excited about....mehrbod"
2,Poor purchase,This does a poor job of shaving compared to a previous Microscreen 3. The shape a button layout are a little inconvenient but that is more a matter of prior experience.
4,Had good Success with Razor,"I've had a few of these Shaver after breaking the trimmer part a couple times. Gets a close shave with little irritation. I like the trimmer as well as it has a good angle to it.This product would get 5 stars, however the battery after just getting it, is awful. I didn't have a problem with my other shavers, so I'm assuming the battery life will increase to normal capacity in time."
5,A Real Page Turner,"Once in a great while I discover a novel that is so good I want to tell all my friends about it. Sissy! is that kind of book. Even though I don't normally read Civil War novels, this one is unusually well-written and I found myself thoroughly immersed in the story. The characters are so real you'd swear you were right there in the 1860s, facing their hardships, their joys, their pains. Sissy! is a great read and every bit as enjoyable, if not more so, than classics like Gone With The Wind. Once I got started reading Sissy! I couldn't put it down. This is a page-turner in every sense of the word, and I recommend this book to anyone who wants to experience a truly great read."
4,A must for every Iron Fan.,"The original ""Tales of Suspense"" issues that feature Iron Man (#39 on up) are out of sight, cost-wise, especially if they're in good shape. So what do you do? Buy this Essential book! Sure it's all in black and white, but who cares? It's only fifteen bucks for Iron Man's very first adventures!The dialogue is cheesy, the villains are cheesy, and the art is cheesy, but in this case cheese is good! See: the first appearances of classic IM villains such as Mandarin, Crimson Dynamo, and the Titanium Man! See: enough Cold War propaganda to recruit 1000 Marines! Perfect for story buffs, not collectors."
4,Curious George--the way we remember him,"[by Vipah Interactive in the style of H.A. Rey]In their version of the iconic character, Vipah Interactive draws upon our collective memories of Curious George. Gone are the thirties' cartoon mannerisms, the gritty ash can school shading, and the vaguely inhumane storyline that characterized the original George book. In their place are clean, bright illustrations, skillfully obscured (and therefore ageless) automobiles and in this case, a plot that evokes the memory of old Lucy shows as seen through the gaze of nostalgia. But the storyline is contemporary suggesting that like choosing Control-Z, we can readily undo the results of our past actions."
2,A few good points repeated multiple times...,"I'm still struggling through the audio version of this book, trying to get to the end. It seems that Katie repeats just a few same ideas over and over again, sometimes even the same statements. The few ideas she presented, though, are useful. But you can get them from her other book ""Loving What Is,"" and that book is more helpful and practical. If you want similar theoretical concepts, but expressed in better writing style (and more genuine), I'd suggest ""A New Earth"" or ""The Power of Now"" instead (actually they're similar too but they're better written than this one)."
5,PROFOUND,"Byron gets right to the heart of TRUTH. This book isn't for the new-age seeker chasing after some state of perpetual bliss. Bliss is simply another experience, and TRUTH is not limited to any experience. . .I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a glimpse of our true nature. . .anyone wanting to see beyond the illusion. . ."
1,One word.....GARBAGE,"His first album(BLACKTRASH) was amazing. This album is complete garbage compared to his first one. Decade should of been called decaying. Everything is just wack. Beats, lyrics.....everything. Don't get this album expecting the same material on his classic ""Blacktrash"". You will be very dissapointed."
5,Splendorific!!,"If you don't like this CD, the devil has got you in a trance! Dorinda sings her face off on this one! She is the hardest singer on Earth! Her voice is rough, gritty, and soothing all at the same time. I don't know why she took so long to come out with a solo project. I just can't wait til she come out with another one. Everything is hot on this album--studio tracks as well as the live ones. I'm partial to the live ones because that's when she gets her good hollas in...I love it!! This is a must have. Hot track: #11--It'll bless you real good."
5,AWESOME ALBUM,"Dorinda is definately a mighty woman of God. She's always been my favorite Clark Sister. I saw Dorinda in Atlantic City at a concert with the Jerkins, and I was truly blessed. So I had to listen to the album more in depth, and I was amazed with ""I'm coming out"", ""You can't hurry God"" and my favoirte ""I'm still here"". Guys I'm telling you, you can't go wrong with buying this album if u haven't bought it yet. Dorinda I love you so much.. Your music over the years has inspired me. Thanks a Million."
1,Warning - shipping cost of $5.59,"They wants $6.99 PLUS $5.59 for shipping. I bought stacks of these recently for $3.99, although it can be hard to find the white ones..."
1,full of mistakes,"The book is full of obvious mistakes. On page 25 the author confuses a flush with a pair; on page 26 he uses a full house as an example of a three of a kind; on the same page he uses the same full house as an example of a two pair hand; on page 27 he uses the same full house yet again to demonstrate a one pair.This review refers to the 2005 edition, ISBN 1-4027-2962-6. I don't know whether he fixed these errors in other editions, but if he managed to publish these mistakes in the first place makes the author less than credible."
1,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly","This author is an arrogant, cocky, jackass who runs one of the best, most informative poker websites out there - yes, he is a dick, but his site is good! He is an above-average player and fairly knowledgable about the game. However his book is really nothing more than regurgitated material that can be found in every other poker book out on the market. Don't waste your money (unless you feel that it is a reasonable donation for the material that you get from his site). Some, including the author, have boasted about the section on shorthanded play being the ""most advanced section ever written on the subject"". This is ludicrous. It is indeed ""short"" (in length, that is), but not of good qualilty. It does NOT provide examples. It is general and watered-down.There you have it: The ""good"" (the website), the ""bad"" (the book), and the ""ugly"" (the author)."
3,"Good book on WW1, passible romance.","Rosemary Aitken's ""Cornish Harvest"" does a good job of portraying the hardhsip of war(in this case World War I) on the homefront(Cornwall, England). Almost everyone suffers, because a loved one is killed, or sent home hopelessly broken, in addition to the rationing and the taking of certain assets by the military. Our heroine, Lizzie, tries to make her way through all of this, by first training to become a nurse, and when the actions of a spoiled rich girl sully her reputation, she joins a farming corps. The characters are richly drawn, but the romance feels a bit forced. All in all, a good novel"
5,A refreshing collection of essays,"The title of this book is what caught my eye - as a kid, I loved walking in rivers, feeling the water rushing against my skin - I still do.Although there are plenty of rivers running through the essays in this book, there is more to them than that. My favorite essay is the chapter dedicated to the merits of ""poking around"". It gives a fantastic justification of spending a day doing absolutely nothing - my kind of day!This is the kind of book that you read in more than one sitting. When you're stuck somewhere you don't want to be - when you're feeling stifled - when all you want to do is escape somewhere to your own little universe - that's the time to read a chapter of this book. If you can't get away to spend a weekend in the mountains, reading these essays is the next best thing."
5,Album of the Year,"Look What I Did is the band your mother wanred you about. Extremely tight musicianship, with song structure to make you dizzy. If you buy one CD this year make this your choice, you will not be disappointed. Look What I Did kicks your ass, my ass and even the ass of and ass! Buy this now!"
3,"Very Promising, but...","I like Zyliss products. I had the large spinner. After about a year of use, it somehow stalled and I broke the string. I could not get it to work again. Bad luck? Maybe. But if you make a lot of salad, which we do, then at some point the string is going to break. I think that for spinners, the simpler the mechanism, the better."
2,western,Classic B western. Tim Holt was up to par. A Zane Grey western that is good(for the time is was written) like all his. If you are not a B western fan then you would not like this one.
5,"Sharp, lightweight, and easy to use","I was thrilled to discover the Professional series of Microplane graters, as they only cost a few bucks more, yet deliver a better product that is made to last.The Coarse Grater is very easy to hold, its teeth are sharp, and the grater performs well with minimal effort. Best of all, it is SO easy to clean. Food doesn't get stuck anywhere, and all I use is a little brush (mine is a veggie brush, since it's handy, and the bristles just happen to be the right length and stiffness) to quickly remove the grated food from the teeth.I'd highly recommend this product, as well as the other products in the Professional line (also bought Extra Coarse Grater). If you don't yet have any of the Microplane graters, look for the one that sells four (4) to a set.From the regular line (black plastic handle), I also have the Zester and Extra Fine Grater, both of which are excellent products, as well."
2,blah,A boring book that I had to get for a class. will probably sit in my garage until i eventually throw it ouot
2,"True, the game may stink, but....","Okay, fine, maybe this is horrible. And I agree. But one major thing is that CHRIS SAWYER DIDN'T WORK ON IT (nor did he on crappy worlds). This game had nothing to do with CS, which is why it's bad. Anyway, this is no bettere than WW, just another scenery expansion pack, no real new rides. It's horrible. Just download the User Created Expansion Set (do a google search)."
3,"Ok, wouldn't buy again","These seemed simple and affordable so I got them. They do the job, but they are clunky and very uncomfortable in the grip. Also, they do not nestle very easily for storage, so they take up a lot of space in a drawer."
2,I do not recommend this book,This book is not suffecient to depend on....most of the conversions you need is not directly there.Thanks you
1,bad shave,"BAD SHAVE. IN PRODUCT DISCRIPTION IF YOU STATED BLADES ONLY LAST 30 DAYS, AND HOW COSTLY DISPOSABLE BLADES ARE , I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THR RAZOR.ROGER YAGER"
5,A must buy,"The book contains explicit information about gemstones, where they are mined, how the value goes up and down, hues, colors, shapes, mineral forms, in clear and descriptive form. I am so glad that this book does not give drab tables of gemstone properties but goes on to explain how to own a valued gem. The pictures in the book are high quality and proves the author's visit to various mines around the world. In other words, the guy knows what he is talking about and leaves great hints for us to follow.As a crystal healer and Vedic Astrologer, I find this book a great reference for my work. Highly recommended!"
5,for better knowledge,I am not in gems trade I am only lover of the stones.This book gave me betterknowledge when I am buying something.It is good written so the readers can understand it.My recommendation to buy this book.
3,Broken Social Scenes sonic postrock debut,"I actually like this CD more than their critically acclaimed follow-up. The trippy psychadelic post-rock of 'Feel Good Lost' combines Sea And Cake or Tortoise with the orchestral rock of Godspeed You Black Emperor. Apparently this was a low budget, low produced effort, but the chemistry of unlikely musical ideas is what makes this work. More raw and lush, less airplay friendly, but shows the bursting of creative ideas resulting from a new collaboration."
1,I don't get it,"This, to me, is nothing but backround noise. I don't know how anyone can really be interested in this ""music"", there is nothing to be interested in. But, then again this is coming from a drummers perspective, and that may be bias, in a way that there is some sort of rhythm required for it to really catch my ear. So this may be for you if you have a really short attention span. Thank you, that is all."
5,Beware Amazon's compatibility menu,"According to Amazon's search for compatible parts, this plug would not fit my 2.5L L4 1995 Jeep Wrangler (but would a 4.0L L6?!?!). Taking a chance, I ordered it anyways and it worked (the photos online looked just like the one I had). It comes with a washer and informs replacing that washer every time you change your oil (looking at my old plug I realized there was a washer on it as well... I never changed it).It does what it's supposed to do. I like products that do that."
1,A Ziplock Baggie would work better than this,"Do not buy this or use it for anything of value. Poor and awkward design and IT LEAKS!!!!I used it in my small sport boat and it leaked and ruined my expensive cellphone, ( I bought it to protect my phone). It has no positive sealing and is very awkward to attempt to seal. Apparently even when sealed it does not stay sealed throughout the day. Expensive mistake. If you value the items you are trying to protect, get a Pelican box or something what securely seals. DO NOT BUY THIS. It really deserves a zero rating!"
2,Lacking a Lot for a Large Book,"For as large as this book is,it lacks a lot, I'm very disappointed! I had to go back to A-Z Crossword Dict. for words as common as ""Dental & Laser""."
2,a bad book in so many ways,this books is pretty bad in the following ways:(1) the story line is so predictable and uneventful that you don't even bother to predict. the author tried to spice up the story by putting bombs in big cities and by putting fighting scenes in white house but the book is still very boring.(2) all the characters are so one dimensional. the main characters honestly has nothing to be liked. it's amazing the author tried to portray such a character as a hero... US will certainly be hated by every other nation if such a hero indeed exists. they just go to other country and wage war in complete disregard local authority. guess that's what triggers terrorism in the first place.(3) it uses jargon for the sake of showing off....i didn't rate it 1 star because it wasn't too painful to read...
1,time to hang it up,"i have read every one of dale brown's books and i'm now wondering why... what is it about a few good reads and then i have to buy every lame thing a guy ever puts out?... there's a lot more good stuff out there than brown's recent weak efforts... can he spell retirement?... talk about hard-to-swallow... i couldn't wait for this major disapointment to be over... count me out from now on... brad thor, dan brown, joel rosenberg, stephen coonts and especially vince flynn... here i come..."
5,Great - simple awesome,"This grater is the best , simple to use and does an awesome job . Teh blade is fabricated with such precision it is a wonder on its own . Great products :-)"
2,Never liked this comp all that much,"When I was first getting into Oi! this was the first comp I picked up , mostly because of it's menacing skinhead cover and I was already a fan of Infa Riot. Well the problem with this comp was it featured way too much Gary Johnson (3 nauseating tracks)and other filler that didn't belong , especially on an Oi! comp. This comp is still very famous , I just never gave a care about it. I prefer the Oi!:The Album over this one any day"
4,BUYER BEWARE,"I don't want to give a horrible review, since I should have read closer, but this CD isn't from the same company as the first Oi! CD. This CD is labeled as 'Chelseagirl Music Collectors Limited Edition'.The sound quality seems to be fine, but the sort of thing matters to some. I was a bit disappointed, but music is music, the packaging honestly isn't that big a deal.The only thing real missing is the linear notes that would have came with the 'legitimate' CD.Otherwise: Good sound quality, fairly speedy delivery. Just wish the seller had made it a bit clearer, the edition I was to receive."
1,Terrible poetry,"This collection of poems was a real disappointment! I was expecting good poetry and a great deal of humour from Kim's book, unfortunately, it consisted of a collection of very poorly written poems that were predictable and contained a hidden religious message. The poems appear to be based on the experiences of a man who has never had a girlfriend or had much contact with girls in general.Metaphors were used inappropriately and the standard of English was disappointing low.I afraid this one gets the thumbs down from me!"
3,Editing,"Purchased this book for instruction in entry level Transportation Course, to which it seems basically well suited. The book however suffers from chronic poor editing of the charts and graphs, poor layout of some charts, such as the motor carrier unit cost chart, and the chart detailing the quantities of foodstuffs consumed in New York. I would let this go if it occurs once, but lack of quality control in these areas comes through more than that. A good entry level text with good scope. I will have to fill in the gaps to assure understanding."
4,sticker review,"I have yet to give this to my husband but its for his vehicle, the only problem i had was shipping they had to issue a new one due tot he length of time i waited"
5,The best book I've read in a long time,Simply fantastic.The way the author describes the ambiance and the tension is amazing. I coulnd't put it down !!! It's short but at the same time so rich.I greatly reccomend it.
2,please dont,dont believe every review you read. sandor marai is not a genius. his work is boring. this book is an exercise in ambience with no plot backbone to speak of.calling it predictable is an understatement.
3,a dry wine,"""Embers"" is the story of two men who haven't seen each other in many decades and now are finally reunited, for a single evening, during which they hope to get at the truth behind the betrayal that came between them.This book was highly recommended to me but, for my taste, I found it rather dry and slow-moving. This may be a weakness of the translation or (more likely) simply a reflection of my own taste in literature. I get bored when reading pages and pages about the table cloth and the flickering candles, etc. The story always kept me at a distance and finishing it took tremendous will-power.I would have liked something a little more accessible and with some flavor to it. This book went down like a too-dry wine."
4,Exquisite,Grabs you with the florid language and leaves you questioning the power of relationships on our lives. I hope you all enjoy it.
2,"Does what it should, but too big","To my knowledge this is the only product which combines music ear buds with cell phone head set. I personally don't like it. The ear buds are too large for my ear and stick out to far, so they fall out of my ears and the microphone is too far from the ear buds."
4,A good quick read,"[[ASIN:0688126383 Pride: The Charley Pride Story ] Well worth the 91 cents paid for this volume ! Have already loaned it to a friend to read as well! An enjoyable autobiography. Note, the book, used, is in excellent condition !"
3,nasb bible,"It is a low cost bible. I use it in the ministry field. I work in the city and travel to alot,something people are in need of a bible. This is a good bible to work from and when needed you can afford to leave behind."
3,useful to drown out sounds,"Although the sounds are very short sound tracks repeated, if you use this to drown out outside noise it is useful. I bought it thinking it would help my infant fall asleep, and maybe also my wife and I. For my infant and myself it is pretty good."
3,Could be better,"I am disapointed in the sound quality in this machine. The sound is muffled sounding and not crisp at all. My husband and I only somewhat like (or can tollerate) two of the sounds. The heart beat one sounds like someone knocking at the wall or door and is very irritating. The babbling brook is so muffled you can't tell what it is. The ocean wave is ok and tollerable, probably the one we listen to the most because it's the least annoying. The white noise is fine if you like listening to static. The summer time is a cricket sound that last maybe 1 and a half seconds before it loops again and after a while it drives you insane. The looping sound is way to short on all of them. We rarely use ours and have been looking for a better one. I think it's best to hear these first hand at a local store before you buy."
4,"Good, but the 1 mistake","The good:- price, $17.99 is a fair price.- solid construction- good fitThe bad:- hard to find, could only find it on amazon- yes, the air vent is in a bad spot. It will surely let rain/snow onto the top rear of the grill, defeating the purpose. I understand why the put it there, they just didn't need to! I also own the Weber Performer. The designated Performer cover does not have a vent, and it's a BIG cover. They used straps at the bottom with velcro so the wind can't take it away. This design should be used with all their grill covers.Conclusion - seems like a good cover, but they decided to not make it perfect like they did with the Performer. Oh well."
4,"This book is,I think, one of the best anime books ever!","I think this book is a must have for every fan of Bishojo Senshi Sailormoon! It's the best I've seen (next to the mangas). There was one thing that was a bit disappointing though, it only really talks about the first two seasons. They should have included something more about seasons 3 - 5."
2,Yawn!,"We're watching the first twenty minutes, and all I could think was ""predictable boring family drama"" - and basically that's what this movie is. Kevin Kline seems to be the same in all his movies - this film actually reminded me of him in ""Grand Canyon"".'My Life As A House' comprises a selection of odd characters who end up helping a dying man build a house he should have built many years before. By the end of the movie, I cared no more for this character or his ""wayward son come good"". The characters just didn't have enough spark to make me feel any compassion for them.I realise that reviews will discuss the special meanings of this movie - such as the importance of family, the need to follow your dreams, good health etc etc, but you will be none the wiser after watching this typical American family crisis movie.Yawn!"
5,ONE OF MY TOP TEN FAVORITES OF ALL TIME,"Yes, I love Kevin Kline. Yes, the cast does a remarkable job with a marvelous script, but it's more than that--this movie has heart. It portrays modern life with its heartbreaking realities of divorce, drugs, sexual abuse, and cancer, but it's what it DOES with these issues that is so remarkable. Redemption is very real here. I loved it so much, I looked up the writer and found he wrote AS GOOD AS IT GETS as well. What a man. I watched this with my teenage daughter and it opened a dialogue between us. That alone is worth the price of the DVD. (Warning: Strong subject matter, you might want to view it first to decide if your teen (if you) are ready for it)."
3,Discover Hayden Christensen,"This film is not perfect. It gets a little soft and mushy in some areas. But for those who can look beyond, it has two great things going for it ... namely Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen. For those of you who are just now beginning to notice Mr. Christensen - for his work in SHATTERED GLASS - take a look here. While SHATTERED GLASS is a great performance, in this earlier pre-STAR WARS performance, Mr. Christensen is called upon to go toe-to-toe with the great Kevin Kline. Not many young actors could do this as well as he does here. Mr. Kline gives it his all (as is his usual modus operandi) and thereby forces Mr. Christensen to do the same. The result is two great performances in a film that ultimately lets them down by taking the obvious pull-at-your-heartstrings way out. Unfortunate."
5,Great Movie,I really love this movie!! It is a very touching story about a man that spent his time building houses and was struck with cancer. It talks about how his family comes together to create one final beautiful project and how it is such a beautiful gift to someone else.
2,"Two stars for the good acting. This is for ""feel good,"" tearjerker fans.","Almost everyone writing reviews of this film love to cry, apparently. The acting is good, but the film becomes much too ""feel good"" for me. (One of the shmaltzy musical background bits almost made me stop watching it.) (I recorded it from TV.) I did watch it all the way through, though, and I liked Kevin Kline's acting.For me, the test of a really good film is to want to keep it in my film collection, to see it again sometime. This one got erased as the final credits were rolling. The ending of the film, which some people loved, made me want to erase the film as fast as possible. :-)"
3,this shouldve ben a free movie,"This is an old movie that should have been for free. I only paid for it because my girlfriend wanted to watch it, but I was disappointed that I had to pay for it."
2,Don't buy this boot if you expect a lining,"Unlike most muck boots out there that have a lining, this pair does not have one! Buyer beware. If it had a good interior lining to it, I'd give it 5 stars. Still, steel toed muck boots at this price are a good bargain."
2,not right,These are not steel toe! They aren't very comfortable...I'm going to buy some kind of squishy insert thing and hopefully that helps with the comfort...at least they keep your feet dry.
5,Everything Just Fine,"What can you say about a rubber work boot? They earn no merit for fashion footwear, nor are the steel-toes especially comfortable. But they are for work. The price is good. The service is excellent. They earn five stars because of functionality. They do their job just fine."
1,Horrible!,"Heels are improperly molded, creating a decided slant to the back and outside edge. These must be considered DANGEROUS to wear, especially considering the potential work environments in which they might be used."
1,Complete False Advertising,"I ordered these with the steel toe being the reason i bought these. Confused right now, because i just opened the package to find that there is absolutely no steel toe in them. Just rubber."
3,Her rendition of well known songs are just not up to par,"This is the first CD I had from Hayley Westenra. Her voice is of course angelic, however falls flat and weak during the entire album. The biggest mistake of the arrangement is the encore of 3 songs people familiar with pop-classical/new age music already know well: Andrea Boceli's Dell'amore Non Si Sa, Sarah Brightman's What you never know and Enya's May it be, her rendition unfortunately doesn't have the power and emotion catch of the originals, which actually makes me crave for dusting up the CDs from Andrea, Sarah and Enya.To be fair, the other songs are generally smooth, good for easy listening."
1,how many odysseys can one person take?,"What's the point of packaging and repackaging a single album? Do these record execs think that us music buyers are so gullible that changing the album cover and adding a couple of 'new' tracks are going to make us buy a brand new cd? Well, I'm just not impressed with this girl's voice to buy 5 different Odyssey versions just for the sake of obtaining 5 extra songs. She has a pretty enough voice but it tends to be flat and far too pretty without real emotion behind it.Scarborough fair? What you never know? Sarah Brightman-esque much???"
4,"superior imaging, natural mids, smooth highs..","KEF isn't a name most are familiar with in the US but should be. KEF differs from the competition in that they use a coaxial midrange/tweeter design. The advantage is mostly in coherency and imaging. The low range drivers flesh things out and blend seamlessly. Regardless, a sub is definitely recommended. They're capable of filling a large room without distorting. When they do reach their limit, the bass drivers chuff a little. They're very smooth and comparable to a pair of speakers I use with ribbon tweeters. In the world of higher end speakers, these are definitely a bargain. The fit and finish is excellent with a unique cabinet design. Two pairs of banana plugs are available for those that want to bi-amp or bi-wire. Note that the 600 price Amazon lists is for one speaker. You'll pay 1200 for a pair. If you're shopping product in this price range from B&W, Paradigm and others, KEF should be on your list."
4,Fine early album from an underrated Brazilian singer,"This 1964 album by Brazilian singer Doris Monteiro is notable for the absence of songs by Tom Jobim or any of the other lions of the then-dominant bossa nova scene. Instead, there are several tracks from second-generation composers such as Marcos Valle (four of his songs) and Durival Ferreira. Fans of Astrud Gilberto may like this one a lot.FYI there are several albums called ""Doris Monteiro"" and/or ""Doris."" This one includes the following tracks:1. Samba De Verao2. Dois Peixinhos3. Baiaozinho4. Vou De Samba Com Voce5. Deus Brasileiro6. Diz Que Fui Por Ai7. Vivendo De Ilusao8. Falaram Tanto De Voce9. Sambou Sambou10. E Vem O Sol11. Razao Do Amor12. Verdade Em Paz"
5,KEF IQ7,"I have allways loved KEF speakers. Their Uni-Q drivers are a real masterpiece capable of producing very detailed images and very balanced and homogeneous sound. These IQ7s are not an exception. They are beautifully built, capable of bi-wiring, quite easy-driven and have good bass extension."
1,Sheesh!,Hmm where do I start. As an animator myself the only redeeming feature of this collage of videos is watching the snowman go after his bowtie..otherwise go make coffee. Most of the animation on this dvd simply does not make sense. The last animation (bonus) is simply fantastic rendering..no storyline though. Skip it and buy all the others Odyssey put out. They are mouth watering.
1,Not What I expected,"I was expecting a flowing visual story with interesting shapes blended with many colors. I must be really off on what computer animation means being that this DVD was computer animation. I was very disappointed and feel that I wasted my money. I didn't even watch the entire thing. I just kept skipping through it. There were break ups of the DVD in short skits that weren't interesting, and the music was awful...kind of reminded me of elevator music. Unless you just have the money to blow and want a odd DVD, leaving you with little knowledge and experience to add to your life...I suggest something like Dinosaurs or Fantasia. This will be a HUGE disappointment for those who are looking for some type of uplifting feeling or think this could be touching."
1,UNA BASURA ( SOLO SE SALVA EL CORTO DE BINGO ),Este DVD se salva SOLO por el corto de Bingo el resto es pura BASURA digital.
2,Information,"Hi. I'm from Mexico City and I would like to know if it is posible to see this film in DVD (Uomo che guarda, L' / The Voyeur) in my country. A few weeks ago I buught a Tinto Brass film named ""TRANSGRESSING"" in DVD too, with subtitles in Russian language and I did not have any problem to wach it.One refernce that cuold help is: 2001 Film export Group, or 2001 Central partnership. Maybe they sell it.Thanks."
4,"Enjoyable, but","I like to keep my reviews short, there are plenty of guys/gals, doing the full bit. I found this movie really enjoyable. It had a story, a bit shallow, but who buys these movies for great story lines. The maid was very sexy with great tits, Dodo's wife, very very very sexy, horny, and I loved the scene where she masterbated in the chinese restaurant for Dodo and the Chinese guy. I was just disappointed at the lack of the voyeur angle, I expected more keyhole peeping or something, I didn't think there was all that much voyeurism in it, that said.it REALLY pleased my girlfriend. Thats another story......."
4,Soulful Gospel with heartfelt meaning,"If you prefer gospel vs contemporary gospel, then you need to try this.Shirley Caesar has yet to be duplicated!"
2,"Mediocre ""Also-Rans"" of the Skinhead Reggae Sound","A couple of good tracks and a lot of filler. In the late '60s, tons of reggae acts sought fame by appealing to the skinhead craze busting out in Britain. Many of these offerings were of poor production quality and lackluster melody/lyrics. Alas, many such tracks ended up on this collection, which is a shame as I love that late 60s reggae sound.Favor one (or several) of the other Trojan collections. The Rude Boy, Rocksteady, and Dub collections all have a lot more to offer."
4,HistoricTragedy in the Dominican Republic,"A true event in the Dominican Republic in the early 1950's during the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo. The Mirabel sister's father was killed by the dictator Trujillo. Some of the sisters and husbands were jailed, but all and all most were killed. It was called the Parsley Massacre. It was a sad event, but those of you who are interest in Latinamerican history and film, this film is for you. The title, ""In the Time of the Butterflies"" as the ""butterflies"" come to harvest the parsley.Oh! Another thing, for those who are fans of Salma Hayak!"
1,Vivan las mariposas!,"I decided to purchase this DVD despite the negative reviews I read about it. I'm very dissapointed with this movie. It makes Trujillo's reign seem benign. Does not really show the fear of those who lived in that time, and more importantly, made the Mariposas look like whining instigators. I read Julia Alvarez's book, and have read as much as possible about life during this time in the Dominican Republic.I also have first hand accounts of what it was like from family members who lived in the country during that time and even exhiled in other countries as a result of this. This movie does not even come close to portraying any of this."
4,good movie,I love Selma Hayeck and Marc Anthony. They did a great job. I wish the movie would have shown more of the prison scenes. But all in all it was a good movie.
4,Promising Debut,"Youth Group's debut disk has some outstanding tracks and some filler. Shadowland, See-Saw, and the title track are terrific. Hopefully this is not the last we hear from this band."
5,Great collectible for Final Fantasy XII fans,"This is not a children's action figure toy. This is something you buy for an adult gamer who's also a fan of Final Fantasy games. Balthier just so happens to be one of my favorite FF men, so I was so pleased when I found this gathering dust in a comic book shop. I'm a little confused by the price on Amazon. I got mine for $24.99. Shop around folks.This is an extremely durable collectible. I was able to change his hands out (he comes with an extra two) and pose him without fearing breaking off fingers. He's very detailed as well. While it is a very close likeness in the face it doesn't appear to be spot on. The clothing however is very well done, as is the gun he comes with. His body is jointed so that achieving a realistic pose is very possible. Now if only they made a Fran action figure that could stand beside him!"
2,Not worth your time,I love the Wild West and comics but this really wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Gets a 2.5.
2,A:M BLUNDER!,"I am upset with this book. It is a great book to learn where everything is located and how it works in Animation Master, but it is written like a TEXTBOOK. Hard to follow tutorials mainly do to the Authors ""know it all"", he assumes that everyone who reads the book is tuned to the same frequency as he is on. The only thing that is very well done are video tutorials, which do help to understand how the author got from point A to point B. But not all the time. And you do need to have a working version of Animation Master if you plan to learn it hands-on."
2,A lot of type with a lot of hype,I purchased this book but found after receiving it and trying to use it that he types a lot of words but gives very little practicle direction. He supplies very few tutorials on how to use the material. He could take some lessons from the Jeff Paries book. In my opinion this book was not worth the money spent by a long shot.
4,Misty,"Excellent read for those who have undergone similar experiences or just love reading war stories, but probably not the casual reader. The sequel, ""Bury Us Upside Down"" is a must read for anyone interested in the Viet Nam conflict. Misty is an well written account of the war as the Mistys experienced it, man by man."
2,Not even avarage,Very few songs I hoped for on this album. I bought it only because I had free shipping if I bought enough stuff. Never again
3,Blanche,The music is great but a couple of the tracks are not quality recording. I have listened to it several times and find myself skipping several selections because of the poor quality recording.
5,Grey's Anatomy Original Soundtrack,Fabulous soundtrack bought as a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it and asked for Soundtrack II as well.
4,Nice Calculator,"Nice calculator. I like the number display. It is a good replacement for my old HP. I prefer numerous digits to numerous functions. I just use it for basic math and therefore would not want a cornucopia of functions. Have not had it too long, so can not vouch for durability."
1,Extremely unhappy,"I ordered this Disney Princess Jasmine doll in August. I was told it had been delivered at the end of the month.....though I never received it. I contacted Amazing Plush and was told it was lost in the mail, and they would send another one. I waited for two weeks and when I hadn't received the doll by then, contacted them again. I was told this one was also lost in transit!!!! How does this happen???? They asked if I wanted to reorder for a third time, and I said NO. they refunded my money to my credit card. This was a birthday gift ordered long before the birthday date yet it never arrived two weeks after the birthday. I was very disappointed and would NEVER order from this company again."
1,"Bought them, returned them","The pepper lid seemed a little loose and I worried that it would fall off, dumping pepper everywhere. I probably would have kept them anyway because they are nice looking and a decent price, but I couldn't get the lid off the salt shaker at all."
1,An intelligently done collection,This collection does not simply list quotations one after another. It also contains prose passages in which Gribetz explains her attitude towards the subject in question. In this regard her autobiographical passage on her relation to Israel was interesting and valuable.As for the quotations she has a sense of what is meaningful and does not as many anthologies of this kind go simply for what is likely to make the crowd titter.An intelligently done collection.
3,"Disappointed, but hopeful",They didn't work in the shoes I purchased them for; my toes were still painfully pinched. I'm going to try them in another pair and keep my fingers crossed.
2,Sad feet,"I had high hopes for these, after reading positive reviews on here and in magazines. For me, at least, these made little difference. My feet were still KILLING me at the end of the night. Too bad!!"
3,A little more comfy,"I suppose it's a little more comfy... To be honest I wasn't expecting miracles from this, but I was hoping the arch was substantially bigger than it was (which was nothing! Not even 1cm tall). It would turn a hard heel in to a slightly squishier heel, not much arch (doesn't even touch my arch), and of course, no toes (but you could buy that separate).If medium-high arch support is painful for you, maybe these would be good enough. I do like how wide the heel section is."
2,This is a cartoon!,"Boy, I was hopping to see a real nanny. I like Fran but was not crazy about the 25 min. cartoon."
4,FOR STRAIGHT TO VIDEO..... THIS IS BY FAR ONE OFTHE BEST,THIS SHOCKED ME AT HOW GOOD IT DID WITH A LOW BUDGET. IT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT PRETTY GOOD. IT HAD A LOWSY ENDING THOUGH. O AND IT WAS KIDA STUPID [SPOILER] OF HOW A GIRL THAT HAD BEEN HUNG ON THE SKI LIFT WAS FLOATING PAST EVERYONE WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING. ASIDE FROM THAT IT WAS GOOD. NOT THE BEST BUT GOOD.
2,Low On Originality and Scares,"Shredder may have been not quite a low budget movie. It had a high budget for a straight-to-video film. However, it was low on originality and scares. The movie's originality was so basic. When the ending came up I thought to myself ""Of course I should of known."" The ending was completely un-original. Also the movie wasn't quite scary. Although I did like one murder. But Bottom-Line is that it wasn't one of the worst straight-to-video horror movies I ever saw, but it wasn't one of the best either."
1,Crashed,"I bought this external twice. The first time; it crashed. I thought maybe I did something wrong by leaving it on often, so I gave the product the benefit of the doubt and bought another one. It crashed also. It makes the same sound as the first time it crashed... I just here clicking and can't access anything. The good news is the external gives hints about when it is going to crash. A few files on the drive will not open and will give an error asking if I want to reformat my disk."
4,It really is plug-and-play,"All you have to do is plug in the power cord, the USB or FireWire cable and your computer will do the rest. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is that it comes formatted in the FAT32 file type, which means it will accept only 4GB at a time. But I wanted to back up the complete system of my two computers. So what you need to do in that case is to right click the icon for the Crossfire and format it into NTFS and it will accept any size file (of course up to 160GB)."
2,"Seemed great, didn't work out at all.","I bought this HD because no one reported any problems with it.Simply put, it does not work for me. I have a laptop with WinXP. The drive will mysteriously 'disconnect' without warning. For example, it just disconnected 4 times in the time it took to copy 500 MB. The first 3 times, the drive would reconnect when I unplugged then re-plugged the firewire. After the fourth time, the drive would not reconnect at all. It would only connect again after restarting the computer.This is typical of every time I've attempted to use the drive. I exchanged it, because I thought it was broken. However, the replacement drive has the same exact problem.The size and the design of the drive are okay. I was impressed with the features and the price. I am disappointed that, for me, this hard drive is unusable. If it actually worked, my only complaint would be that the drive gives off the faint smell of burning plastic."
1,Stay Away,"I own this unit and it does not function properly. If I am not unplugging it in order to reset it so that it will turn off or on, I am banging my head against the wall while attempting to get it to play factory DVDs and CDs. The unit also tends to skip ahead a chapter when the fast-forward button is pushed. This piece of equipment is frustrating to try to use. After 5 years, I have developed a better touch for this finicky machine. I would avoid it if I had it to do all over."
5,I think its great!!,"Someone in there review said it did not have multi disc funtions, but I can say it does because I own one. It has a great price and very good quality. Picture on TV is incredible and has zoom feature which makes widescreen movies look bigger and much more...."
3,A little disappointed,I wasn't as pleased with this cookbook as I had hoped to be. I guess I expected it to be more health-conscious than it is. So many recipes include over-processed and empty-calorie ingredients that don't nourish the body.
5,Info on Beans,"Regarding the ""fart"" comment earlier - beans have fiber, which moves waste out, avoiding cancers and other intestinal problems. There is actually less gas if people eat enough fiber regularly. Most people don't, so that is what causes gas in the system.Combining beans and peas (also called legumes) with any kind of seed grain(whole wheat, rice, sesame, corn) results in complete protein. Adding a little dairy like yogurt to the mix, and you have all the possible amino acids. Peanuts, oddly, also are part of the legume family."
2,"Just a general recipe book (rice, beans, etc)",Very few rice recipes and nothing creative. I would suggestjust looking on the internet for rice recipes instead of purchasing this book.
2,Not worth it,"As another reviewer stated, it's not worth going through the bad recipes to find the good ones. I tried a few and found them either bland or too Indian/Eastern-flavored (too much garam masala and curry for my taste). Although the total number of recipes is impressive, many seem repetitive. I'm sure the book has some good recipes, but I am not willing to waste money and effort just to be disappointed more often than not. If I had seen the book in a bookstore I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a book that helped me use my new rice cooker. Instead, this is a book of recipes that use beans, grains, and rice on a conventional stovetop (i.e. pot on a burner).That said, I still gave it three stars because the recipes look good and not ridiculously complicated. However, since I'm a vegetarian, I already have plenty such recipes, so I'll be sending this book back. What I really needed was hints on how to make the best use of the rice cooker."
5,Simple Text Appeals to Young Readers,We recently introduced Biscuit to our daughter (nearly age 2 yrs). She asks to read about Biscuit's bath several times a day and comments as we read together. The word repetition creates an easy rhythm we both enjoy. The text and drawings work well together.
1,Metokana Wing Machine Corkscrew a Bust,"I was very disappointed with the way this product performed. It does not seat properly on the top of the bottle, thus the screw enters the cork off center making pulling difficult and resulting with a ruin cork with cork particles inside the bottle."
3,another story about an beautiful girl who doesn't know she is beautiful,"Ok. First. I am not trying to put down this book from the get-go, but it really bothered me that when the initial diving team was diving they didn't talk about the chance of them getting the bends from surfacing so quickly. I KNOW this is a fantasy novel, but come on!!Other than that it was alright. The story of a beautiful girl who doesn't know just how beautiful she is. You have heard it all before. For you avid romance readers it sticks to the formula, but there is enough of a story there that it doesn't read like one of those super boring romance books. If you are looking for a light read, go for it. I enjoyed it enough to finish it. I love mermaids, fairytales and mythology and this had a little of each. I really think it could have did without the graphic boner description; it didn't really add to the story, but I will let that slide."
5,Read this Book!,"Though it has been a while since I read this book, it has stuck with me. The twist and turns in ""A Change Called Death"" will leave you wanting more. Sean is someone you would want on your side. This book has all the elements that turn a good story into a GREAT find. Read ""A Change Called Death"" and enjoy a night filled with suspence and drama!"
3,ok for beginners,"If your experienced in yo-yo, dont buy this. For longer tricks like atom bomb or mach 5, it comes up halfway through. This is frustrating and sometimes painful. If this is your first yo-yo this might be a good choice though. It sleeps long enough for you to do semi-long tricks like stop and go or rock the baby. Its ok for loop tricks also."
1,doesn't show up righ,"this doesn't show up right on the kindle. It has the picture of the pages with the drawings that also have the text, and then the kindle text doubled. . ridiculous"
4,Same lovable chimp I knew,"Cute, curious chaos maker is back again, as usual though, things work out well. In this installment George, along with his mentor in the yellow hat finds a kitten, they take the homeless feline to the shelter and alas George discovers the addictive antics of playful puppies. Obligatory mayhem ensues, all resolves with prerequisite happy ending.In short, you loved these books when you were a kid, your children will too."
4,Great for the $$,For the money its a great vest. Runs small by one size. After a couple of treatments it really softened up. I would recommend this vest if you don't want to spend big $$. It looks good and does the job.
5,Long Lasting,These bottles are of good value. I use my set to spray leave in conditioner in my clients hair. I love the fact that it has measurement increments on the side being that sometimes I may want to mix a concoction of some sort. It sprays well and most importantly it does not leak around the neck. I consider it a very durable product.
1,"Some great matches, terrible documentary","This set has some great matches attached to it that are worth seeing. The documentary itself is horrendous. There are so many inaccuracies, so much left out and so much twisted that it doesn't reflect the history of WCW at all. It's one of the worst documentaries WWE has ever produced. It's a travesty for WCW and NWA fans. Just awful."
2,Starts off good but ends horrid,"The start of the dvd with story of how WCW started is AWESOME. All that lead up and all the info and views really makes the first dvd the best of the set.The classic matches are good too. It spans from 85 to 94. These are all great matches with numerous matches with Sting, Flair, Lugar and great tag matches.Unfortunately, the third disc is not put together well at all. Only two good matches on this dvd, being the NWO vs WCW Fall Brawl and Steiners vs Outsiders. There should have been WAY better matches, mostly consisting of the NWO Black and White as well as the Wolfpac, which was easily the biggest Rise of WCW. You have to guess that they are gonna make a NWO 3 disc dvd that will span this, but unfortunately, its not on this set as it should be. When you end the dvd with Booker T vs Lance Storm that will ruin anything."
1,A Day in a Colonial Home,There are so many misspellings and random words that I found it very difficult to read. The book had little continuity and jumped from one thing to another.
4,Excellent... Works just fine.,"I'm using it for almost a year. It's works jusp perfect. The bad is just the 1~2 seconds it takes to check your fingerprint.My grand father's fingerprint doesn't works. Maybe because with the age, he losts his fingerprint.I reccomended it. It's a good value, just 200 dollars for a good lock. If you can spend 400~600 bucks on a better one, go ahead."
1,Really???,I'm sure it's a great book....but $205? Really? Do they know that most teachers buy these themselves? That price would make it so tempting to copy from a neighbor with the book....
2,I don't iron my sheets!!!!,These sheets looked nice when I first got them but after washing them they are the most wrinkled sheets I've ever seen!!! They looked awful out of the dryer. It says you can iron them but I've never had to iron my sheets and won't start now!!

2,Not his best,"Wynton Marsalis is a great musician, but the past 6-7 years, his releases have been hit and miss. This new cd is one of the misses. It sounds overly cutesy to me. The good thing is that is a small band recording, just Wynton with rhythm, and that we have not seen in quite awhile. However, I know I'll never play this cd again, especially when All Rise, Blood on the Fields, Marciac Suite, Big Train, Black Codes, J Mood, etc are sitting on the shelf."
2,Not too much magic,"This is a somewhat disappointing CD although good to hear Wynton again in a small group format - the CD, however, is not on par with his recordings of 15 years ago. Sounds like a rhythm section that doesn't play together all the time. Some nice moments but the magic is missing."
3,Myanmar (Burma) People and Politics,"I am considering a trip to Burma. This video beautifully depicts the spirit of the people and the beauty of the country. I believe the current political regime is described accurately. The video production quality is very good, however, the English language narration is dubbed over the original soundtrack and is VERY difficult to hear. I tried SAP on the VCR, but that's not the problem. I finally had to keep my ear to the audio speakers to decipher the words."
5,Coastal Delight!,"I loved Chesapeake Bay Cooking by this author and I adore Coastal Cooking. For anyone who has loved cooking on or by the beach, this book is a must have. It's strong in seafood recipes but there is so much more. The Firefly Farms Goat Cheese Cheescake is to die for! Can't wait for the companion show."
4,nice set,i reviewed the green set i bought just like this. that is the reason i bought this one. i liked it so i bought another. I just wish there was a larger one to go with these.
5,My all-time favorite romantic comedy,"Fun, fun, fun, 'til your Daddy takes the re-mote away.It's clever, funny, *very* romantic (as only the French can be), and full of twists and turns. It's one of those movies that one thinks about and enjoys long after watching it.I had to buy it so I could watch it over and over."
3,"entertaining, cute, with lots of potential","There's art, mystery, love and more. It's just that you are caught up in so many stories at once and then at the end just one story is finished. There is a lot of development in the beginning of the movie, but at the end it seems to finish in a rush.The ideas are great and could be further developed, I think Amelie does that more. It's entertaining with some magic and charm, but doesn't quite make it.It's worth seeing once, but probably not buying"
2,"So French, So poorly done","How often have the French played with this idea of lives with no degrees of separation, random choices creating monumental impacts, and destiny culled out of simple moments? So many times, you would think they could avoid doing it haphazardly. Too many storylines, too few clear characters, too many loose ends. And in the end, I was so ready for this movie to be over that I couldn't have cared less whether the young lovers wound up together. To be certain, some of the moments are compelling, but not enough to add up to a good movie."
4,"Dark, depressing, poetic and thought provoking.","On Celestis, humans have done what they have always done well throughout history: conquer, subjugate and assimilate the conquered without regard for the native culture. Then comes revolution and unrest. This is the setting for an alien - human love story that is like no other.This was a darkly poetic, thought provoking novel. Park presents a gloomy picture and there isn't much here to cheer about. The relationship between human and alien is seen from numerous points of view. But it is the alien's point of view that is most disturbing and unfortunately most accurate. As the drugs wear off she begins to thinks of humans (and her ""lover"") as dogs.This is an important work of science fiction. But if you are looking for fast paced sci-fi adventure this isn't for you. If the characters weren't all so pathetic I may have given this 5 stars. Recommended reading for the serious reader."
4,From a mom - of interest to kids AND adults,"I didn't have anything to read so I started reading my son's books. Many I just couldn't make myself read. But this series is interesting, well written, and very imaginative. My 12-year old son and I have read the first 3 and are anxiously awaiting the next."
4,shocking,"The music is beautiful, as well as the scenery... but I can never watch this film again. I'm glad I saw it however. One of the main jobs of art is to ""distribute the suffering""(-?) This film does this very well. Get ready to feel the intense pain of a beautiful young girl under an unfeeling and corrupt system."
5,Technology at Your Fingertips,"Sandy Berger has written a great new book about gadgets and gismos that is very easy to read and understand and explains what many of these gadgets can do to help us in our daily lives. This book is also filled with resources for gadgets to help you find the right gadget for your particular need. There are gadgets in this book that can help people cope with health problems as well as simplify our daily routines and computer needs. Very informative to people of all ages who are looking for the ""right"" gadget or gismo."
2,Writing via auto-fill,"Is it appropriate that the author writes like a lazy ""C"" student? After just a few pages, you realize she uses the exact same phrases on EVERY page. Couldn't help but wonder how much work she actually put into actual research. Did she simply gather a few brochures from schools to craft this book? Two stars for having the info in one place, I guess."
2,Expensive repair,"We purchased our TV 3 1/2 years ago. Now needs an optical block for 1500.00. Thought we were buying quality with this expensive of a TV. Repair guy said this should not have happened and Sony says, out of warrenty. Trying to decide whether to fix or just get a new TV with a new warrenty. Good luck to the rest of you."
4,A lovely vacation,"Wandering through Calabria with Mark Rotella was a lovely experience.Rotella visited Calabria, (located in the toe of the boot of Italy for those like me who might have missed this in school), several times, to connect with family who were originally from this area.My Italian roots were ripped from soil in the northern part of the country; though I was unaware of this, there is apparently quite a bit of animosity between north and south in Italy, with the south, including Calabria, playing the role of poorer, uglier sister. Rotella finds much to love in the south, including the people who've always been tied to the land; the beauty of the land with its mountains and oceans; and the produce, that is, the oranges and the olives and the incredible figs.Rotella has a nice way of telling a story. I enjoyed this visit to Calabria. Thank you again, kind BCer, watchcat, for sending me on my loveliest vacation this year! :-)"
5,Great. . . . . . . . . . . .. . .. . . . . .. .,Great. . . . . . . . . . . .. . .. . . . . .. . I don't like this review process as you are required to type too much
5,Really handy.,"The head chef at my cooking school had this one. Handy to have it always with you, to wear around your neck when making a big meal. Instantly it accelerates to the current temperature. It does have a long life battery, but remember to turn it off."
1,Broken Out of the Plastic Packaging...,"After having read the other reviews on this thermometer, I should have been adequately warned . . . but I ordered anyhow. Now I have an expensive rattle. It seems as though some people have had good luck with this thermometer, but I would propose that that is all it is, luck. It seems as though the ""exact specifications"" of the Taylor company are not quite up to Six Sigma standards. Despite the box having been adequately packed, with nary a bend in the box upon arrival, the flaming thing won't turn on. Further, the little bit of trouble shooting provided on the package and on their website has not resolved the issue and it is impossible to get through on their service line. If it wouldn't void the warranty, I would love to look inside to find the source of a rattle which I would assume is a broken connector or loose screw. Instead, I'm going to deal with the hassle of getting this thing returned or replaced. Learn from my lesson and stay away."
2,Too slow for larger cuts of meat,"Even when you place the probe before turning the unit on, it takes 5-7 seconds to get a read. This greatly reduces accuracy when checking the internal temp of large cuts of meat and predisposes to over cooking. Accuracy in liquids or anything with a uniform temperature however is excellent."
1,Definately not waterproof,The thermometer fell into a sink full of water and flooded. It is definately not waterproof.
2,Not the best single out there,"Nirvana's ""In Bloom"" was the last single to be taken fromNevermind, and it was rather hastily put together. The ""In Bloom"" single includes the title track of course, but also two live tracks that have no real redeeming quality to them compared to their studio counter-parts. There as far better studio versions of the live tracks ""Polly"" and ""Sliver"", and truly, it is not worth the money to purchase this single unless you are trying to complete your single collection."
1,Author is child pornographer,K.P. Bath was just sentenced to 6 years in prison for possessing graphic and violent sexual images of very young children.
1,The author of this book was convicted of child pornography,"If you are considering buying this book, you should be aware of the author's crimes.According to CNN, on July 9, 2010, ""A federal judge sentenced children's author K.P. Bath to six years in prison Thursday for possessing child pornography. Investigators found a large collection of pornographic photographs and video clips in the Portland, Oregon, home of the author of ""The Secret of Castle Cant"" and ""Escape from Castle Cant,"" according to a statement federal prosecutors released Thursday.""Many of the videos graphically depicted the sexual abuse of very young children,"" the statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon said. Bath, 51, pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing child pornography. Bath's collection included images depicting sadistic conduct, rape, sodomy and bestiality, prosecutors said.""[...]Do you really want your money going into this guy's pocket?"
4,Best Book Ever,"If you love adventure and like funny books I don't know why you are sitting here. Get up and go get this book! I love this book because it is so funny.It is about a bad, bad boy. He finds a key and goes inside Castle Cant. In the castle he finds a door to another world. I recommend this book to 6,7,or8 graders.-Darien"
4,a powerful collection,"the influence of Big Youth has been far and wide in both reggae and punk music. he is often thought of as one of the most influential toasters and an innovator of the dub style.this is a monster of a collection with a whopping 41 tracks spanning (mostly) his early career. every song on here is a classic in it's own right. you can find no wrong here on this set of fine jamaican music. if you are into the styles of U-Roy or I-Roy, then buy this Big Youth 2cd set with confidence and expand your knowledge of this legendary figure. you won't regret it."
2,Taylor Digital Thermometer,"The unit is nice and worked well until I took the battery out. After removing and reinstalling the battery the unit no longer stays on Fahrenheit. Now the only way I can get it to display on Fahrenheit is by keeping the F/C button depressed. I contacted their customer service dept. to address this issue and have never heard back from them and this was 3 weeks ago. Furthermore the auto shut off feature is useless because it only turns it self off if there are no fluctuations in the temp for ten minutes, which is impossible because the temp is always fluctuating so make sure that you actually turn the unit off or it will stay on."
2,Meh,Pros:Reasonably pricedLarge digital displayBasically accurateCons:Really ugly!Smaller than it appears online
3,Wont calibrate,"Very nice thermometer however reading is lower than actual temperature. I tried to calibrate unit according to instructions, however display will not change as calibration screw is turned. Must have a defective unit.M.D."
5,Excellent Thermometer,This is the best food thermometer that I have come across. Its a bit expensive but I feel that it is worth it for the high quality.
5,"Good Product, Good Price","After the complaints about accuracy, I tested this with other thermometers. I found it as accurate as others. Not much else to say, but I view this as a successful purchase. Good product, good price!"
2,Broke quickly,"Worked fine for a few months, then it got stuck on Celsius and can't be set back to Farenheit."
1,save your money,"Mine lasted about a week, and was not accurate, I am very disappointed with this product. I do not recommend this product.."
1,could not get it to work,I worked on this item for almost an hour and could not get it to work. At first it came on and would not turn off. Then it would not come on at all. Tried battery both ways and still didn't work.
1,Don't bother with this thermometer,It looks nice but it's highly inaccurate. Reads too cold at cold temps and too hot at room temps. It doesn't agree with any of my (calibrated) thermometers. The calibration feature on this one is imaginary. The auto-off feature does work but only in a perfectly stable temperature environment.Save money. Go to Harbor Freight and buy the cheap black thermometer that will work accurately for years.
3,"Good thermometer, nothing exceptional","I found this thermometer to be slow to read, had the battery pop out by itself when I pulled it out of my knapsack (I'm a professional cook). I did not see any improvement over the round thermometer I use every day; so the larger head made of plastic does not make up for the digital display. I was looking for a very quick reading thermometer which this is not."
5,Love it!,"I have gone through so many thermometers, but this one is sturdy, easy to read and because of the bright color, I do not misplace it."
1,Broke after two uses,"I don't have much to say as it broke or got liquid in the display within two weeks. No misuse on my part - just used it in a roast, washed it off and put it with my other utensils on two different occasions. I do like to check the calibration in boiling water, but I can't imagine that broke it.Oh well, back to the old standard. No digital for me."
5,Accurate digital pen thermometer,"I've had this thermometer for about a year now and am very happy with it, primarily because it is very accurate. I just tested its accuracy with ice water and boiling water and it was within 0.5 deg F of 32 F and 212 F respectively. I've used it exclusively as a meat thermometer. It's still running on the original battery and the screen has not fogged up at all. As the manual indicates, it takes about 10 sec to stabilize on a reading.When I wash it, I only wash the stem and not the plastic display unit. Although it says it's waterproof, I would advise to be a bit conservative with that statement to avoid potential issues."
2,"So far, a disappointment","The reviews of this meat thermometer made me think that this was exactly what I wanted - a thermometer that would quickly give me an accurate reading. I admit that I didn't test it before I tried it on some meat. I did as instructed and the temp. showed as way over what I wanted so I quickly took the meat out of the oven. However, the meat was just fine. (It had read the meat approximately 10 degrees too hot.) This happened twice before I went through the calibration process (testing it with ice water.) I was able to re-calibrate it within 2 tenths of a point. I will try it again the next time I have meat. Hopefully it will work as it was advertised or it will be useless to me."
4,Easy to use but a bit slow,"This is a reasonably nice thermometer. It's accurate enough for my purposes, it's waterproof and easy to operate, and its storage sleeve doubles as a handle for keeping your fingers farther from the heat being measured.Although the packaging claims it's ""instant-read,"" that would depend on your definition of the term -- the packaging also states that a reading takes 8 seconds. I wouldn't call that ""instant""; besides, it usually takes longer in my experience. To speed it up a bit, preheat the stem, and don't turn it on until it's inserted in the food you're measuring.All in all, I don't expect any better performance at this low price."
1,40 degrees off,"The thermometer was 40 degrees off. Not worth sending back, but I surely will think twice before buying another Taylor product and will not purchase online."
5,Fearlessly roast what you have not roasted before!,"Prior to being given this thermometer by my brilliant cook of a daughter, I judged the doneness of a roast by time, touch, appearance, and experience. Although I have never undercooked a roast, I am sure that I have often overcooked them. Now I find myself willing to cook roasts of different sizes and shapes than I am usually accustomed. I thank my wonderful daughter for this truly liberating gift!"
4,"Splatter Resistant, Not Waterproof",This probe doesn't deserve the waterproof designation. But even if it is just 'splatter resistant' the small increase in price is worth it. It is not particularly fast (but is as fast as any other probes I've used).
1,bad thermometer,It might be that mine is defective but this thermometer is very unreliable and usually off by around 20 degrees. I tried calibrating it in ice water but it did not work. I'm going to try something different to replace it.
1,non-functioning after one use,"Bought this thermometer and after one use, we thought that the battery died based on other people's reviews. However upon replacing the battery with new batteries, we realized it might not be a dead battery, but a defective unit. Unfortunately it's too late to return the product - lesson learned to next time check the battery sooner instead of assuming what the problem is. Very disappointed in the product - hope to find a better thermometer soon."
1,waster of time and money,"I requested a replacement as per warrantee dircectly from Taylor Precision Instruments of this Taylor 9842 Commercial Waterproof Digital Thermometer which failled to calibrate accurately. Instructions were followed to a (T). The replacement failed to be calibrated as well.I am surmising that the entire shipment which Taylor Precision Instruments obtained (MADE IN CHINA), was faulty. I also think I would be wasting my time and money contacting TPI again.Thanks for the opportunity to VENT over this product.DISAPPOINTED PURCHASER!!Note: I am usually satisfied with purchased made through AMAZON."
1,Extremely Slow!,It takes this thermometer 10-15 seconds to get within 5-10 degrees of the actual temperature. This is TOO SLOW! I would not buy again.
2,Nice digital thermometer but the battery doesnt last long!!!,"I love this digital thermometer. I use it anytime I'm cooking with beef, pork or chicken. That being said I've only had the thermometer since feb 2011 and it's already giving me error messages saying the battery is low. Now it won't work unless I replace the battery. seriously?? I would have expected it to last much much longer. SO disappointed."
3,Not what's pictured,"The actual operation of the thermometer is fine, but what I recieved is not at all what is displayed in the picture that is shown. What I recieved was a rather cumbersomely sized, wedge-shaped device with the readout located on the side of the instrument, not on the top (end) as shown. Really a bit large to carry around in ones shirt pocket without noticing its bulk. Carrying it a tool pouch might be risky as well. With the controls located on the side, there is the possibility of other tools coming in contact with the on/off switch, thereby energizing the unit accidently and draining the battery. Not suitable for my intended purpose, however, my wife is now the proud owner of a very nice digital thermometer for the kitchen."
2,"Takes readings very fast, but inaccurate and won't calibrate","The thermometer seems to have solid construction and is easy to use. Once I received I tested the thermometer using the ice bath method. It was off by about 0.8 Fahrenheit (too low). I tried to recalibrate it, but nothing seems to happen when I turn the screw. I guess you get what you pay for.Overall the readings are fast, but the quality control seems to be spotty and mine would not calibrate."
3,Bought it for my Wife,She wanted a good wateproof thermometer for cooking. This one seemed to fit the bill. She received it for Christmas and cooked the turkey with it. The turkey was awesome so I guess the thing works as advertised!
1,Broke after third use,"I loved the concept of this product, then it would not operate when I tried it after only three uses."
2,It's just Okay,"I like the way you can use the holder to also hold the thermometer. This helps protect your fingers, however I thought it would work more quickly than it does. It takes about 30 seconds to get the final temperature"
2,does't fit your ear well,"I had the motorola standard bluetooth earphone and bought this one to use in the office with skype. It's really uncomfortable. The band that goes behind your ear rotates around, instead of opening like a wing. Therefore, the earphone it's always compressing against your ear. Sound-quality and battery life is good. It doesn't come with any software, and it just has a little button to synchronize, etc. on the usb piece. I did not find it intuitive and I'm having trouble configuring it."
5,A must if taking the Seismic portion of the CA PE,Great practice exams! Used in conjuction with Seismic Design of Building Structures: A Professionals Introduction to Earthquake Forces and Design Details by Michael R. Lindeburg should help even those without seismic background (such as myself) to pass the PE.
3,Tough to cook well,"The taste is not as good as regular pasta and it tough to cook it Al Dente. It is either too cooked or not enough. I bought for my son, but it is too hard for him to chew (he doesn't have teeth yet)."
5,BEST GF PASTA I'VE EVER HAD,"This pasta is awesome. Good quality and very close to the real thing. I've made mac & cheese, tuna pasta, and pasta salad with it and all have come out great. I've never had a problem with it cooking before. The water gets cloudy but that's about it. I find it easier to add a lot of water and a splash of oil to when boiling, just like regular pasta.I never write reviews but I just had to on this one. Yum Yum :)"
5,Best travel chair ever,Very comfortable chair for the many sports we attend. Much more comfortable than the bag chairs and just as transportable.
4,Ready for Little League Baseball!!,I purchased this chair for my daughter who keeps score at her sons' games. She was excited to receive this sturdy piece of furniture...
4,great for the dirt track and campfires,"i bought this for my husband who loves to eat, drink and blackberry while watching the races at the dirt track, this is perfect for that."
4,haven't read it,"(...) I found it thought-provoking, moving, suspenseful, exciting, zesty, passionate, vigorous, and especially well acted by Don Johnson and Jeanne Tripplehorn. However, I would definitely read the book only AFTER seeing the movie lest you get all wadded up in frustration."
2,Crabby and Self Absorbed,"I enjoy the memoir format. I keep a diary periodically myself athough attempts to re-read it expose my earlier, dumb days and I don't get far.Doris Grumbach has created a similar work, yet as a bona fide ""writer"" has decided to impose it upon us.She gripes about everything and where I seek insight I find only her justifying her crabby, half-baked ideas.Her later, Extra Innings shows her softened and thankfully more usefully instightful.The John Cheever memoirs are far superior and really succeed in getting some interesting thinking woven around the nuts and bolts of everyday life."
5,Think your child doesn't like poetry?,Absolutely the best collection of poetry for children I've seen in my twenty plus years of teaching. My copies are all falling apart from being thumbed and rethumbed. I've had students madly copy poems into their notebooks because they don't ever want to be parted from them. I don't want to be parted from them. Bring this book back into print; it's absolutely wonderful.
3,Fair,"The book was ok. It was completely discolored ad is pretty worn, but for the price it definitely will do fine."
3,Missing Credits Song,"During the end credits there is a song playing that I don't believe is credited (I searched everywhere), and I would really like to know who it is. It's the first song that plays during the credits, a sort of electronic beat with a woman singing.If anyone knows who this is or what the song is called I'd be grateful to hear."
1,What A Nightmare!,"I had high hopes for this DVD, as several people had posted favorable reviews of it. Indeed, it is well sung, and the orchestra sounds great. However, this is simply the most irritating staging of an opera that I've seen in my life. There is never a moment, and I mean NEVER, when there aren't hundreds of extras flitting about like idiots. It becomes impossible to listen to the opera.One would be tempted to listen to the DVD with the picture off, but all those people running around make a great deal of noise, and their stomping frequently drowns out the music.It is an incredible display of directorial self-indulgence! Dario Fo is the director, and If I ever meet him, I'm going to slap him as hard as I can."
3,fork thermometer works well,"The fork gives a quick thermal reading without needing a lot of parts. Unfortunately, you have to turn the fork in the opposite direction than you would normally use it. That isn't a big handicap."
1,Don't waste your time,"My wife bought me this to replce the original Thermo Fork I had for about five years that I got from Walgreens for $9.95. The 1st time on the grill this thermometer went haywire and flashed several different readings. I changed the batteries thinking they were low...same result. Sent it back thinking it was defective and was chastised by the cust service rep, inferring i was doing something wrong. I got the replacement a couple weeks later and had the same problem. Needless to say it went straight into the trash along with my money!"
3,Large Fork Thermometer,"This was quite a bit larger fork than I expected. Only the left tine has temperature sensing. The tines are really too big to use as a fork. As a temperature sensor, one probe would be adequate if you don't really fork meat with it. Works fine, though.Jim"
2,"Hand wash only,. and careful when you do.","Only for the meticulous. I bought this as a gift. Unfortunately when it was hand washed (not dishwasher safe) the handle must have gotten wet, because it stopped working."
1,GARBAGE,"VERY DISAPOINTED. I received this Taylor Digital Fork Thermometer and did not use it right away. I was cooking some ribs and decided to try out my new Digital Fork. I took and out to find the battery was dead, replaced the battery and found the only thing that worked was the blue light. Now I am stuck with a $20.00 item I can't use. Lesson learned."
4,An investment series of cases,This is the first book written on the subject of describing/detailing life cycles of stocks/mutual funds and really getting into the detail so its all understood.
5,The best book about investing,If you don't get it read again and so on until you get it. This is by far the most relevant book on the subject.
4,"Finally, investing background/fundamentals I can understand!","Initially, I was intrigued by the title of this book when I saw it on a shelf in the University of Chicago, School of Business bookstore. I am still reading the book, but find it both informative and interesting in that it goes to great lengths (which is good for me) to explain differences between investing and speculating (of which I have been doing more of the latter, regretfully). The book also explains some of the psychologies of various investing strategies; why, how and who uses them and, more importantly when to use them. I am still learning about various bond strategies and plan on purchasing government bonds as a hedge against inflation in my IRA. This is a great book to keep nearby when you don't want to watch TV during the holidays (or for any time for that matter)."
4,The best book?,"It is hard to argue with Warren Buffett when he says this is the best book on investing ever written. It is less hard to argue that a newer book that includes modern value investing tools would go a long way towards being more useful. Nevertheless, this is well written and interesting. It is just hard to imagine how people did all that research back in the days of slide rules and stone tablets:)"
3,"Good book, wasn't impressed though",I only read the commentaries as I was unable to understand the older english used by Graham. I wish it was much simpler.
3,Expectation,"It's good but i've expected more, need more about investements, not only in Wall street. Maybe should be updated till today's market"
2,Boring...,"As a keen fan of The Eagles since a long time, I'm collecting all of their works, and the tributes, too. So I drag this one, too, but...female voices without soul, easy accompanying guitar lines -no fantasy, no heart, no guts.Some school music student at first year could probably perform a better work...Well, all in all, this cd is really boring, and IMHO, not too be considered if you're not a real compulsive collector.Alberto"
4,Scary Movie!,"In this movie Ray Liotta plays a psycho serial killer who is being transported cross country by four federal marshalls. Heescapes,in the process killing the four marshalls as well as every passenger on the plane. A flight attendent is the only person left alive on the plane. She is pursued by the psycho serial killer.She finally makes a link with a pilot on the groundwho talks her into sucessfully landing the big jet. She lands after several interruptions from the psycho serial killer.Theserial killer provides a great deal of excitement and action during the movie.The scary action makes the movie worth sittingthrough and watching. An entertaining movie."
4,Pure Action!,"At first, Ryan Weaver looked and acted as if he were innocent of the crimes he had been accused of. Just don't make him mad!If the part of Ryan Weaver had been played by anyone other than Ray Liotta, this movie would have gone down in a big ball of flames. Ray Liotta was PERFECT for this role. He can play ""charming"". He can play ""innocent"". He can also play ""psychotic""!I loved it when he said, ""Sure you could probably reach it, but could you use it? Can you kill? I started with birds and squirrels, and moved up to cats and girls.""The intensity in his eyes, the feeling in his voice, I didn't know whether to be afraid or fall in love!"
5,Cassandra's Angel,"What a great book for young and old alike. We forget the impact ""words"" have had on our sense of self worth and confidence. This book is a reminder to provide our girls with dreams for the future so they realize that they can be what ever they want and do what ever they want. It is my favorite book to give to new mother's of baby girls."
3,tae bo on crack?,"this workout plays as if it's on fast-forward, down to the music which literally sounds like a cassette tape that's playing in fast mode. and the music has to be the most godawful workout soundtrack i have ever heard! having said that, if you do not want to risk pulling a back muscle, try doing the workout at a slower pace. the ab work is good and works the whole group of muscles BUT there is simply no need to go at that breakneck pace. advanced doesnt mean it has to be faster."
4,a new and interesting concept in literature for me.,"having not encountered a ""kafka-esque"" approach to reading before, i was entranced by the story line. it was difficult to fully comprehend all the symbolisms and parallels, but challenging literature is meant to be an enjoyable task. definetely, kafka has entered my will read this(and other) book over again, because i am sure that there is endless subjects and interpretations that i missed on the first excursion!"
2,Scanned book is difficult to read,"Instead of being a true digital version, the book appears to be a scanned version of the print book. The text isn't as easy to read as it could be."
5,These are perfect for reverse appliques...,"I purchased these scissors for a project I was doing with a reverse applique. They worked great and cut through the knit fabric with no problem at all and they weren't too heavy in my hand, which was a big plus. They were very comfortable to use once I got the hang of the odd shape. I would recommend these scissors if you do reverse appliques, for sure."
4,good product,this is a good bag but i wish it was just a little bit bigger. but a very good bag for the value
1,don't buy this book,lots of typos.The source code is even not properly aligned:It is indented by one space in one function and 5 spaces in another function. And all this occurred in one simple program.This is the worst formated programming book I have read.put lots of code on the book to occupy the pages and bloat the think of the book and the price. Accompanied CDROM doesn't contain much useful information and it simply increases the cost of this book.Don't buy it. You will believe me by spending a couple minutes on this book at a bookstore or library.
2,So So for Quilters,"As a quilter I'd skip this book completely and simply purchase Design Explorations for the Creative Quilter: Easy-to-Follow Lessons for Dynamic Art Quilts by Katie Pasquini Masopust. Some of this content is also in that book. If you want the right brain drawing info go for the Betty Edwards book. Katie does a much better job on her own in Design Explorations, than in this joint venture."
5,Simply the best...,"The first time I saw this, I was only 9 years old, but I thought it was great then and I still believe it is today. Then, I thought it was extremely funny to see so many fairy tales wrapped up in one story. Now, I realize the importance each story played in another one. There are so many relationships going on at the same time. Bernadette Peters is hilarious as the Witch. You share in Joanna Gleason's confusion and happiness. Little Red Ridinghood just makes you want to slap her, I think that just makes her all the more endearing. Robert Westenberg will make you howl as the Wolf. Over all, this Sondheim and Lapine collaboration has become one of my favorite videos to watch, and soundtracks to listen to."
4,A new twist,"This book gives a new twist on some old stories. By way of the Woods, the story created a way to entertwine them all. We go through the experiences of Cinderella, Jack and the Bean Stalk, and the Baker & his wife who are in want of a child, and let us not forget, the Witch and her Rapunzel. Each character wants more than anything in the world something, and they sneak around eachother at times and at others work together to eventually find a happy ending for them all. Also, for those of you who sang ""Into the Woods"" in school or who have seen the play enough, there are times when you can just start to sing it out for your toddler's amusement. Though I cannot forget that some parts with the Princes have a bit of suggestive talk, but nothing truely in appropriate."
3,Close but no cigars,The razor is good but not close to great. It leaves a neck rash unless one is very light with the touch. I have been through three razors in the last year and this is the least bad.
5,Very Accurate,"I felt like I picked up a book and started reading about people I know. I spent the last half of my teenage years in foster care - and this book hits very close to home for me. I knew kids who lived on the streets. Their home lives were so bad that they would rather face that uncertainty than the abuse of whoever they lived with. And they didn't all turn to drugs or alcohol or prostitution. They weren't all bad people. Most of them were just trying to make it through one more day, ya know? I can relate to this book. I've known the kids it's talking about. They're real and they're hard, but the ones who survive and the people who help them along the way are just a few of the reasons why our country is so great."
4,"A little ovedrboard, but needed","This book was an excellent tool to pass the ARRT Done Densitometry registry. It was a little too wordy and boring, but it gave all the information that was needed for the test."
1,Fake Reviews,It's pretty obvious that all the 5 star reviews of this book are fake. Check it out. None of these people has every reviewed any other book. Is Mr. Kim the person faking these reviews?
1,UUUUH NO!,I waited to give this a review cause I didnt think it would be right to throw an opinion up here without knowing how it worked out.Well let me just say IT DIDNT WORK OUT AT ALL! It never kept a seal on the wine so guess what my wine was never PRESERVED!That is what this product is for right?And to top it off the pump broke a couple weeks after the buy!Whatever you do DONT BUY!
3,Works well but not reliable,"I bought this to keep partial bottles of wine fresh for a couple of days (no bottle lasts me longer than that anyway). The pump seemed to pull a good vacuum and the stoppers held it for that period, emitting a satisfying hiss when I vented the bottle. Then it broke in the same unrepairable way other reviewers have experienced. Now it's junk.I'm going to try the Vacu Vin."
1,Doesn't Work in 1.5 Liter Wine Bottles,These stoppers do not work in the larger 1.5 liter bottles of wine. They only hold a vacuum for a short time -- not until the following day. Another brand that I have does hold the vacuum in this size bottle -- probably because it goes over the lip rather that inside the lip of the bottle. I thought I'd pass this on to those who want to use the stoppers in both size wine bottles.
5,good and cheap price,"Now I can use this pump to withraw the air from my fine wine to save it for later use without tasting bad.I don't like the amazon free shipping, it took a long line to arrive."
4,"Works well, but I don't like the shape of the stoppers","I bought this as a gift for a friend and thought I would compare it to the Vacu Vin Wine Pump and Stopper that I usually buy. The idea is the exactly same, and I would even say the quality is identical, but whereas the Vacu Vin stoppers are round, these are square and for some reason they feel strange on a round bottle. Dont't get me wrong, they work just as well as the round ones, and the hard plastic storage box is a nice touch, too, but I took off one star for the stopper design. I guess it comes down to personal taste..."
1,Doesn't hold a seal,"I rated this one star because it simply doesn't work. It came with 2 seals, one of which held a seal for several days. The other wouldn't hold a seal for a day. I called Metrokane and had them send two replacements, both of which did not hold a seal for more than a few hours.Try a different brand. These are glorified corks."
5,Wine accessory,"This product is to keep wine fresh. It removes the air from the wine bottle. We use it for our oil since air can make your oil rancid. This keeps our oil fresh. It works great but it didn't quite fit our oil container so I put the oil in a clean, washed wine bottle. Our oil even smells great.Pat Guevara"
2,Doesn't Work Consistently,"I had one of these for a few years (grey not black) which worked great, but recently the stoppers started to wear out. I purchased a new pump and a few extra new stoppers. The new black stoppers and pump seem to only work about half of the time and dont seem to be made as well as the older I had model was."
5,Works Well,"After several different products that didn't work, or didn't work for long, it's nice to find something that allows me to seal a bottle and put it back in my wine refrigerator lying down, and not have it leak."
5,Best There is.,Great for all of us that do not finish a whole bottle in one session. It preserves the wine flavor and aroma nicely until the next time you want a sip or two.
1,Self-indulgent tripe,"If you didn't already hate Hollywood and the egomaniacs that come out of it, you will after spending the half hour (maximum) required to read this bit of ego-on-parade. The wittiest part of the book is a dust-jacket blurb which, on closer inspection, seems to be more damning with faint praise than anything else.I wish there was something good to say here, but there isn't. Mr Vilanch writes a mediocre-at-best column that should never have made the transition to book form. If you really need to read this, look for it to show up in remainder bins for $1.99 in a matter of months. There is perhaps one readable essay, nary a decent laugh in the book, and while Vilanch may be able to write award acceptance speeches (we assume, for all the back-patting he does), he certainly can not _write_ -- some editing was badly needed for these cobbled-together essays, most of which veer from one dull topic to another like a drunk person."
5,American Christmas Carol,"My wife's all time favorite Christmas movie around this time of year. Have been searching for years for this item, and prices up until this year were outrageous. Product came well packaged with no issues and on time for Christmas eve. Made my wife's Christmas Eve to have this back in our collection"
4,Christmas Carol With Depth,"Henry Winkler turns in one of the most moving performances he has ever done, and the scenes with this films version of ""Tiny Tim"" will bring a tear, I don't care who you are!It's become part of our Christmas favorites!"
5,Good Holiday Movie,I was very happy with the time it took to deliver. The quality of the movie is great! The DVD case was a little thin.
5,Fluenz F2,"I loved this product. I bought both Rosetta and this and I prefer Fluenz.It was just easier for me to learn the language. Don't know if it was just easier for me as an adult. It was also cheaper...yet I didn't feel like I got cheated.There are only two disks and if you want more after the basics, I don't think there is much out there...I would like to see a Disk 3 and maybe even 4....but for now I am happy with my 40 lessons.....I am hopeful that I sound like a native would sound...or at least will be understood."
4,"Came on time, seems to work","This, combined with a hdmi-dvi adaptor allows me to use my older monitor on an new computer. It does not ""sleep"" the monitor, I have to turn it off. I don't know where the fault in that is since there are a number of parts and specifications in the picture."
3,Good and nerdy,"This album starts off very strong, and is funny until the middle. Then, the editing kicks in, and it's clear that few audiences laughed at Posehn's lesser jokes, so the album takes on this laughter-edited-in quality than didn't quite sit with me. Posehn references Patton Oswalt a few times because they knew and lived with each other. While Oswalt extends his humor beyond his sci-fi, nerdy self, Posehn wallows in it, and sometimes this works in Posehn's favor but too often it doesn't. And he knows it. He sighs at his own flopped jokes and struggles to regain steam. He throws off using segues as if it is old hat, but really the best comics have always moved fluidly within their respective material. This is a funny album, yes, but it's not always at the same level of humor."
2,Reference Book Only - Don't buy to learn to use Quickbooks!,"I bought this book to learn how to use QuickBooks properly after my accountant noticed a few major issues with how I tracked things in my company file. I found this book worthless for a beginner trying to learn how to use the product. Also, it doesn't seem to provide significantly more detail than QuickBooks online help. The only thing I've used it for so far is learning a good account naming scheme..."
5,Surprized,I had never read anything from this arthur before. This book has depth and more depth. I will be reading more books from Athol Dickson.
1,What the heck is this?,"This album sucks. I wouldn't have given it one star except that i couldn't go any lower. There is no creativity, the instrumentation is poor, lyrics stupid, and this album is just plain freakin boring. Don't get me wrong, I love this band. Loved them for a long time. Love them for their own quirky, unique style. But, dang. They have strayed so far away from who they are it doesn't even need the band name newsboys on it. Sure, they can say ""oh, we were inspired by our heavenly influence to do 'another' worhip album."" It's obvious they just made this one to cash in more on the current ""let's all do worship albums"" trend. I have nothing against worhip albums...i loved the last one they did. This one just plain sucks and i regret i gotta pay the bill on this one. Mr. Fuller, here's a suggestion. Go back to the inspiration that you got on Thrive and start from there....cause, dang man...one more like this and the fans will start dropping over dead."
3,Good seller nice product.,"Did not work for my application. I thought it would enable a LD player. My bad I cannot get my LED tv to show color LDs. All players used to directly input on Vacuum Tube TVs. I might try to find a converter, any suggestions?"
5,touching,I sobbed out loud in the bookstore. Beautiful and touching story of a dad's love for his son.
4,A concise and short book about Moscow's battle,"I read this book, here in Brazil.This book is short, easy to read , concise, has many photos(all black & white) and is mainly correct.Failures of this book are small.One failure are the weak maps the second failure is the lack of informations released, decades after this book to be published.As an introduction about this subject, this is a good choice.If you want details and new informations, please choose another book, about this same subject."
4,Engagingly written ethnography and history of brujeria,"This volume offers an engagingly written ethnography and history of brujeria (witch-healing) as practiced on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. Romberg argues convincingly that brujeria is not a marginal or exotic practice, but an active partner of contemporary Puerto Rican consumerism and the welfare state. The book concludes with an insightful discussion of the nature of magic and an exposition on the quest for ""authenticity"" in contemporary Caribbean religions. Recommended. Stephen D. Glazier, Professor of Anthropology, University of Nebraska."
2,blocks the bottom fan,"I got this for my 17"" Gateway Laptop. My laptop fans are located on the bottom. Since the base is not very sturdy... it kept blocking the below fans. So I returned this product.I have to admit that the stand is really comfortable."
2,Not impressed,Not really impressed. Not comfortable on my lap. The middle area for cords is a good idea. But if uncomfortable I just don't use it.
1,Does not keep computer cool!,"I bought this item because it was a lot cheaper than the portable laptop fans to avoid overheating. Well, I should have spent the extra dollars because my laptop overheats on this thing in half an hour and shuts off on its own!"
4,Does what it was designed to do,Quality is good and does what it's designed to. Bought for my wife to use in bed and keeps the laptop off her lap.
2,Might work for some - not for MacBook Pro.,"I bought this to use with my 17"" MacBook Pro. I returned it nearly as soon as I bought it because my laptop slides right off. The MacBook is quite light and does not have large rubber feet. A heavy laptop with decent-sized rubber feet might work fine with this stand. It also has absolutely no cooling effect on my laptop (not what I bought it for, but worth mentioning.)"
4,Too Large,"As another reviewer mentioned, it is very bulky. However, it does the job by keeping my legs cool as I use my laptop and provides ample elevation to make it easier to type. The only complaint I had was that because it is so bulky, it makes it uncomfortable to type the more inclined you are. Also, what's interesting is I found the hole between the top and bottom layer very useful to store various documents while I type. Ex: reference sheets, homework, etc."
5,Very happy with this laptop stand,"I'm so glad I finally bought a laptop stand, and this one is comfortable, simple, and works well to keep my lap cool while sitting on the couch using the laptop."
3,Practico.,"Presenta un buen diseño, practico, fuerte, pero el inconveniente es con los macbook debido a que se resbala cuando se inclina."
5,Good product!,"I was looking for something that would elevate my laptop to prevent having to slouche or lean forward to read the screen. Compared to the ones I checked out at the Mac store and the similar iLap, this seems like a great deal. I would recommend this stand for others."
4,As good as it was in 1985,I bought the album back in 1985 when it first came out and I am happy to say that the CD is so much clearer than an 18 year old import vinyl. This version of Stairway to Heaven is a great club classic with the musicians from Toto and the Scorpions coming together to make a great CD! Highly recommended.
3,ran big,"I agree that this is a comfortable shoe, but it ran big. I can wear a 9.5 or 10. This was a 9.5 and it was like a large 10 or a 9.5 wide. I might not give them away, but wait for one of those feet swelling days, but they are comfortable...hey, maybe a thick sock day."
1,Don't buy this razor,"I would give this product zero stars if they'd let me. Do not buy this razor. It doesn't work. I grew up using a Remington electric razor and still have an old model that works well. I decided to get a new one that could be used in the shower and what a waste of money. It doesn't cut the hair, period. I ended up throwing it in the trash can."
3,Read Mutant 59: Plastic Eaters instead,"Ill Wind is well-enough done and a good cautionary novel. But I liked the plot in the ""original"" version better - of course, there are no new plots and art is all in the rendering. Pass on this one."
3,Oil-eating Bug Dissolves Plastic Characters,"The authors explore our society's dependence on petroleum-based products and the danger of relying on technological fixes for our every crisis. Also, they take a shot at the power mongers who would likely rise to the occasion given the circumstances. Unfortunately, the descriptions and characterizations aren't up to the ideas behind the story. There are too many characters whose motivations were unknown to me; more time should have been spent developing them--instead, I followed the antics of numerous characters with whom I never really got comfortable and, in the end, never really cared about"
4,Ill Wind Highly Entertaining,"Ill Wind was a very entertaining read. Anderson and Beason carefully describes the people, places and events. Though the story is perhaps a bit implausible, that doesn't make it any less entertaining. In fact, much good science fiction depends on a slightly implausible plot. The authors obviously spent a lot of time researching for this book. This one is difficult to put down once you pick it up"
3,starts off good but in the end too many plot twists,"I started off liking this book but midway through I got kinda annoyed with the plot twists. I enjoyed how Bliss and Sebastian reacted to each other. And their love scenes are steamy and innovative. However, the general plot is just too all over the place. It tries to cram too many pieces into the puzzle and quite obviously some don't fit. This detracts attention away from the main couple Bliss and Sebastien."
5,Coward's short stories,"Some brilliant work here. The collection includes the title story, but my favourites include ""Me and the Girls"" - about a male rep artist recuperating in Switzerland from TB, reviewing his life with the troupe. ""Mr and Mrs Edgehill"" is also in here - a British couple representing the UK on an otherwise American-occupied island during the war, and their relationship to each other, and to the crown. ""Penny Dreadful"" - a smalltime writer's life story.Noel Coward mentioned that the stories were among his hardest to write. They repay brilliantly. The man (as we all know) was simply a genius.Incidentally, the BBC turned the top six into a series. I've also seen a longer version of ""Mr and Mrs Bridges"" - for some reason given an unhappy ending. Catch them if you can."
5,Catchy,"I've been waiting for years to get this hard to find album. I finally got it and let me tell you, the songs are real catchy. If you're looking for an album you can dance to, this is it!! My top 5 songs in order include: ""Thug Lady"", ""Holden It Down"", ""It's Up To You"", ""Push It"", and ""Tonight""."
2,All the world's... or just some of them,"The book is a mixed bag on concepts. The story of the development of fighter tactics during the century is very good, earning the two stars for the book. However, the lists are restricted to the most top aces of every country. Biographies of important pilots are not here (not even Erick Hartmann). Some Richthofen-phobia is also present in the book. The book is just adequate for beginners, but for serious readers the Aircraft of the Aces collection by Osprey, and Toliver & Constable books are recommended."
2,Not for me,I personally did not care for the poems in this book. I thought some were goofy and nothing that would have children want to read again. More for babies to look at the pictures than school children.
4,ESSENTIALS OF CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT 2ND EDITION,"This book matched up perfectly for each assignment. I have purchased books in the past with the correct title, but was probably the wrong edition is why the assignment page numbers didn't match up. This book you could tell was used, but it served its purpose perfectly.Thx"
5,Love Amazon!,"I go to Ashford and their books are sooo expensive. I have been using Amazon for awhile now and I love it and I get my books delivered in a timely manner. Thanks amazon, your a lifesaver!"
5,essentials book,"The product came really fast, way before the due date. It was in good top notch shape. Almost like new!"
3,Informative but far fetched.,"This book has alot of good information. However, to me it seems to reach out to far for facts that are not there. I do have to say that I read the whole book just because I do like to read others point of view."
4,Flying Phantom,Inside Look:Mary-Kate and Ashley are on vacation when they decide to hit the famous musium. They are shocked to find out that it's haunted and get a first hand look at one of the hauntings.The trenchcoat twins set out to find the ghost or person behind this spooky mystery...---My feedback:This was a cute little story took me only fifteen mins. to finish. It's not scarey for older kids but it may spook the younger ones.But anyone who is ever seen Scooby-Doo could probaly crack the case before the twins.
4,Punch you in the eye,"I think this documentary really captures the free wheeling nature of a phish show. The music was cut into the film great and the editing was fantastic. I couldn't help noticing that Trey is extremely full of himself in the film. It is no wonder the band is broken up with an ego like that around. I only hope that they can reconcile and get back to playing tunes together. After some of the dialouge belched forth from Trey I wouldn't have blamed Fishman from punching Trey in the eye. I would have liked to have heard more from Mike, he seems to be the most interesting and unassuming guy in the band. Page also came off as being a very professional and serious musician..."
2,If you're looking for a Phish show...look elsewhere,"The DVD wasn't bad if you wanted to know every little background detail about the band that they could squeeze into 2 hours. I found myself saying play some... music already. When they did it was only a 30sec to 2 minute tease. Bottom line if you are looking for a Phish concert on DVD, this is not it."
1,I never got it,"same thing as my doctor who order, i have not recieved anything in the mail. please contact me as soon as possible"
1,"Really bad book, bad taste..","Good or bad, I don't normally write reviews but today my kindergartener came home with this book and I absolutely hate it, yes HATE it!. So I decided to write this review. The book starts out fine, two cows want to dance like humans. They go to the farmer's party wearing dresses. The old lady thinking they are humans sets them up with two rednecks to dance. The description and depiction are disgusting. Then they were served hamburgers, one cow realizes its beef, possibly their friends(at this point I was thinking wtf) so drags the friend and they both run away. Then the stupid humans come looking for the girls, by this time the cows have removed the dresses and left them on the tree. The lady says the girls ran away leaving the dresses, for this the red necks say yoo-hoo!! What a distasteful thing in a children's book. I let my kid read the book anyway as he has to take the quiz, but I wish he didn't have to read this book."
1,not the featured series,This is a shorter version of the series featured on Discovery ChannelThe whole series is a set of 5 dvds which runs for 10 hours 3 minutes.
5,Surfing the Internet made easy,"I have read several of Sandy's books over the years and I continue to enjoy everything that she writes. Great Age Guide to the Internet is no exception. Sandy's ease with words makes this book a pleasure to read and is so full of information. If you don't know how to get around on the Internet, or only know a little, read this book. Sandy will show you everything you need to know."
4,Well Organized with a good index.,"The book provided clear, practical examples to answering many of my questions. Some of the questions that the book answered in two minutes took a Sybase support rep 6 hours to figure out."
2,"Fantastic Idea, but Poor Plot","I don't know how Universal hurt a movie that had such a great idea, but couldn't produce it correctly. It is hard to screw up this story. You have a story about a secret society, one of the most powerful in the world, and instead of developing that plot, it looked as though this was a skit on Saturday Night Live making fun of the story itself. The acting was particularly poor and it was hard to have a strong level of empathy with any of the characters. Not one stands out. All the characters appear shady, dark, depressing, and yet, it is quite clear that not all of the characters deserved this trait. We didn't really learn that much about the secret society (other than it likes to keep secrets) and the school the students were attending. Where is it? Yale, I presume; but there is little discussion on what the students are like who aren't in the secret society. I think this movie could have been done much better."
5,"""As Requested""",The product arrived quickly....The VHS tape showed a Quality rendition(picture) of 'Skulls 2'......It was what 'they' advertized & it's what i got(!)........Hope to deal with them again!
2,Pathetic Copy of the first movie,"I really enjoyed The Skulls but was sorely dissapointed by the sequel. The movie is jumpy, there is no characterization, the plot developtment isn't there, and there is in general no suspense whatsover. Watch the original and forget the sequel."
3,It leaks alot,"My son liked using this. I didn't. It leaked all over the bag I was carrying it in. When I open this to refill it, it usually splashes from the lid and makes a mess. There is usually some liquid trapped between the layers on top which makes it hard to clean.On the other hand, it is easy to hold by the handles and it is easy for my son to drink from.Nevertheless, I don't plan on buying any more of these."
2,Nice cup but it really leaks...,"I bought this cup for my son transition from bottles, after having tried Nuk training cup unsucessfully ( he could never get the liquid from the spout without leaking). Unfortunately I liked the cup shape, easy to clean, he could easily drink from it, but for my surprise it pours if you hold it up side down."
2,I'm just not that crazy about it...,"I found that some of the tiny pieces I placed in the 150 would flip over before they reached the tape. I have to use really long tweezers to make sure it goes in properly. You can't just reach your fingers in easily to get it out, if it flips. I couldn't do it without the tweezers. It's great for the bigger pieces. I don't recommend this if you are doing a lot of pieces at once, because you have to rub a stylus around all the edges on the outside, and the inside. Otherwise, when you pull off the tape on top, you'll get sticky on the front of your pieces."
3,All about what you want to do with it,"Pretty neat little yoyo. My main reason for buying was that I had one when I was younger. I must say for the time it was ahead of the curve. But, in the new age of metal yoyos it doesn't stack up to the competition. It has a very low sleep time. It's fun to play with you can do beginner tricks with it rock the baby, effil tower, jamacan flag, and a brief trapeze. If you are wanting a yoyo for tricks I suggest an aluminum yoyo. Or maybe an exodus 2 if you've never used aluminum. It's all about what you want out of it. I'm happy with it."
1,ShellShock Nam 67,"Game will not play on Nvidia 6800GT. Company suggests to revert to a nvidia driver from early 2004, no other help is given. Dont waste your money on this if you have a 6800GT."
3,Pretentious,"Late 1960s, New Orleans. A sniper shot a woman Lew Griffin had just become acquainted with so off he goes. Or does he? More people than expected ring his bell and every one of them is invited for a cup of coffee or a drink. People drop in and out like stage characters that have missed the right play, all good guys whose main claim to being in this small book is that they fill up space. The bad guy does not ring Lew's bell, he hurts him. Lew meanders. Lew reads good books (The Stranger). Lew drinks a lot of whiskey. Lew gets beaten up badly twice but recovers to old form in next to no time. What's in this gumbo? A bit of Chandler, Ellison, Himes, and others: yes; some existentialism especially in regard to black/white tensions of the time: sure; interesting thoughts on human memory: yes; a good story: no. Lew gets the killer, of course."
2,terrible acting,Don't waste your time. This movie is passable as a B movie and thats about it. The acting is horrible. The story line is ok. I'd say pass on this one.
2,Horrible maps and incomplete information,The maps in this guide are horrible. There is no consideration of progression or game play after lvl 36. Was very disappointed that there was no information on the Mysterious Set Quest.Save yourself some frustration and just get your information from the internet. Usually the only advantage an official strategy guide has over the internet is better maps.
1,Worthless,"Whether one loves or hates Los Angeles, most people agree that it's an interesting place. The remarkable achievement of this book is that it makes L.A. sound boring.The book consists of chapters written by different authors, all of whom consider themselves to be knowledgeable insiders but who are generally clueless.There are a lot of good insider guides available for L.A. This is not one of them.UPDATE: Check out the comments to this review, one of which was written by Suzy Beal, who turns out to be one of the authors of this book. Then note that all of the positive reviews are written by undisclosed readers, which suggests ballot stuffing."

2,I would try another.,"The sound quality of the headset wasn't what I expected. It wasn't always reliable in establishing a connection to my phone. The ""earhook"" hurt my ear (and yes, I tried both sizes). I returned it."
1,"sent it back... LITTLE battery life, DROPPING of pair rel'p","Not happy with this purchase. I had to send it back.I'm a heavy cell-phone user; I'm in sales and am on the road a lot. I really rely on my phone. I liked the idea of having a Nokia hand-set (6310i) and Nokia bluetooth headset.- Poor design: ear-piece is painful to wear for long periods of time, ear-loop broke on third day, power & volume buttons are small and difficult to use- Battery life: batter lasted MAYBE an hour of talk-time. It would beep a few times, then go dead. Once it didn't beep at all and just died in middle of a call.- Dropped connection: the pair relationship would intermittently drop. I've seen this comment from others not specifically related to the HDW-2, but the comparable Jabra product. I wonder if it may be a Nokia handset thing.In short, I was very disappointed with this purchase. I think I'll give the Jabra a shot. The consensus on the Jabra seems very positive."
2,"Good headset but VERY VERY, bad design","It's a breeze to setup up this headset to work with Nokia 3650 but the design is so poor that it's not worth buying when there are so many other well designed sets.The 'earhook' not only hurts, it is very delicate and I broke the larger one. The small one fits only infants! The engineer who designed the 'earhook' must have very very tiny ears! I used super glue to stick it but it keeps breaking every other day. I am not able to find any one selling an extra large size or a spare one. So, I need to design something that works for me!Functionally, it's great and works fine and is very loud and clear. You can control volume from the headset and answer the call from the headset. Also, you can use the same charger used for the phone. If you have 'tiny' ears go for it!"
1,Shocking!,"I was browsing through this book when I realized why the name was so familiar. This is the same judge who let the killer of Dominique Dunne off with a slap on the wrist. He always wanted to be famous, and apparently still does. Well he's infamous because of the Dunne case, that's for sure. What a joke."
5,Just what I needed,"I had to buy a Moen hose guide to fit this (the hose guide I bought at the home depot was not the right size), but that's about all you need to know. BTW the plumbing supply company near my house claimed Moen did not sell anything like this. I'm glad I ignored them and went online to look.The hose guide I bought to go with this is Moen 115040."
3,Wordy,The book went into a lot of details that were not important to the story line. The ending was too abrupt. would have liked to known what happened with Ms. Millions cousin/husband and Ms. Lovelace Aunt.
2,"Great mouthpiece, unfortunately very short life span...","Bought the Kelly 3C in ""Crystal Clear"" not quite two years ago. The sound is great and it is comfortable on the lips. Unfortunately, about a week ago, I noticed that the shank is starting to crack vertically from the end. It seems to be traveling up the moutpiece, and now, it's almost a half inch long now. I thought that the Lexan plastic was supposed to be be fairly indestructable, unless you abuse the mouthpiece (drop it, crush it, etc.). There's not a scratch or abrasion on it. I wouldn't have thought that normal playing would do this. I guess we'll see how good the warranty is, but the replacement cost is $10, which seems high for a manufacturer's defect. Don't know if I'll bother with it, or just go back to a traditional metal one. I've never seen those mouthpieces exhibit this kind of behavior."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I am not really sure what I expected when I ordered this mouthpiece, I had never heard or seen a plastic mouthpiece so I decided I would give it a try. I thought it would have been made a little bit more solidly...from the moment you pick it up it has a very lightweight cheap feel. Also the rim is very narrow, if you are player that uses too much mouthpiece pressure (like me) you will definitely feel this mouthpiece sinking into your chops. There are much better ways to learn to reduce your mouthpiece pressure."
2,It realy flys and for at least ten minuets,It's crash proof.....I am an RC pilot and I highly recomend this to everyone...
4,Seems to do what it is supposed to do,"As with many other people, I have some old floppies and no way to get at them. So, I bought this.The only reason that I gave it 4 rather than 5 is that initially, when 1st installed it, it didn't work right.It would not recognize a different disk w/o unplugging and then plugging the drive back in.Finally, I shut down the PC, restarted it, and watched carefully after plugging the drive back in. It reinstalled the driver, why I don't know, and the PC seemed to now have an accurate profile this time of the drive. Don't know what happened, but it works fine now. I'm running Windows 7."
1,Worthless in all respects,"This device arrived in a plastic package that had ben torn open and crudely taped with clear packing tape, obviously returned as inop by a previous buyer. This delicate instrument was shipped unprotected in a USPS Priority envelope and was so badly damaged it could not be tested or used. Worthless. Useless. Trash. Do not purchase this device from this vendor."
2,viet language textbook,"My order didn't come with any audio as noted. I would probably return the product if it were not for the inconvenience and cost of shipping.As an Intermediate text, audio is a must for it. Thereare sections with no English translations and without audio is not much of any help."
1,Olga bra,I have another bra like this one but the one I ordered is too tight around the band and doesn't fit the same way so I don't know if you got this item from a different distributor.
1,uggghhh,"Do not buy this vocal crap. You can get two Ferry Corsten for the price of this unmixed, vocal crap. Please, do not waste your money."
5,KHW Review,"The product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. A positive experience. Thank you!Sincerely,Kathy Hardie-Williams"
4,Fresh Rain Rules!!!,"If this item sold in larger containers, let me know. I bought enough of these to get free shipping and will receive a $10 rebate. No tax, free shipping, and money back... Can't beat that deal."
2,"Poor Fit, Poor lift","Bad fitting bra! The cup was way too big at the nipple while being too tight at the top of my breast and didn't provide any lift at all. Also, I didn't realize how thin the lace is. Would not recommend."
3,"Terrific Book, but Film Doesn't Capture It","I wanted to see a film version of A Wrinkle in Time so badly that I was rooting for this film all the way. However, it must be difficult to capture a book of this imagination if you do not have a big budget like the Harry Potter films or do not have a script that matches the book. The acting by the children are fine, but not stellar, and the beloved characters Mrs. Whatsit & Company were too bumbling and comical for the story. Perhaps a darker, less comical version would have been better."
3,A Wrinkle in Time,"Although the characterizations and effects are well done, I never quite felt totally drawn into the movie. The story centers around three kids going to another land to find the father of two. This land is beautiful with some unusual beasts. But what is most striking about the movie is the emphasis placed on emotions like love. We are shown how love for family can save them from pitfalls they may fall victim to whether in a strange land or at home. Good quality DVD with fair replayability. I recommend renting it first. My wife and daughter have read the book, and they were slightly disappointed. If you enjoyed this catch ""Into the West"" and ""Princess of Thieves"".CA Luster"
1,Really Bad Movie,"The title of this review sums it up. It was a bad movie, definitely not Disney's best work. The acting was pretty sad and the plot was hardly admirable. I liked the book but this movie is beyond help. The effects were bad, the acting was worse, and the plot was monstrous. They move the plot through to fast and they don't take the time to let it make sense. I don't really need to say more."
1,From The Age Of The Dinosaurs,"This book may have been OK back in 2003 when it was written but the world of game development has changed significantly since then and this book will now teach you all the bad ways to make a game.Game Development and production changes on a month-by-month basis so you *have* to keep up with the new principals and practices.Save your money, there are now some awesome online resources[...]"
1,Disappointed,"Bought this watch, it just arrived. First time I tried to set the date, was unable to do so. Second time, the crown (knob on the stem you set date and time with), came off in my hands. Didn't realize I only had 10 days to return to seller, so I am stuck going through repair centers. Expected more from a watch at this price point."
3,Good but...,Pros:- Price- Rubber feet (for internal shock insulation)- Short usb cable (easy to pack)Cons:- No installation guide- Y cable didn't work- No Firewire interface
2,Dont get this!,"I love South Park, but this set is stupid. Get the season set instead, its way better than this joke."
5,Beautiful!,"We were absorbed by the beautiful life like illustrations. The text is simple, not too wordy. Can be read by a beginning reader."
3,Gardens Good for Light Reading,"This book is good for light reading. It's a little like the ""Golden Girls"" without the humor. Each of the three ladies in the book have a definite personality and obstacles to overcome in order to live a fulfilling life. The message here is that life doesn't end at 65 and new beginnings are possible. While some of the situations seem a bit contrived and you do have suspend belief the book doesn't suffer for it. That is the wonderful thing about books."
1,Buzz Off Yourself. Don't dare buy this.,"Alas, this cheap toy in a box won't work. Don't dare buy it for a child. My 14 year-old electronic genius tested it before I gave it to his cousin....END"
2,Very disappointed,"I just received a copy of this two-CD set, and I'm annoyed at two things.1) The amount of time given to certain songs. Many are chopped down to one chorus -- it's the only way to present sixty-plus songs in a quick one-evening show, but still...2) The track cuts are abrupt. If your CD player is set to pause between tracks, prepare for lots of terrible cutouts. Couldn't they, for the sake of a recording, presented more of the songs as stand-alone? Or made the transitions cleaner?The voices are good. The chorals are very sweet. One of my favorite tracks is the duet of I'm Wishing and One Song - very good arrangement, I'd like to see sheet music of it. The older songs, such as Minnie's Yoo-Hoo, are well-done and welcome. It's a nice touch hearing the new Belle, Ashley Brown, singing A Change in Me.But don't go out of your way to get this CD collection. It's just not worth it in general."
4,For Disney Lovers only...,I was thrilled to see this live! The cast was great- and if people don't know they are buying tickets or a cd for a musical review they're going to be disappointed. But I enjoyed & thought it was quite witty & LOVE listening to it over & over again! If you love Disney songs- you'll love this- it packs in EVRYTHING!
2,A very disappointing book,"I had brought this book expecting it to be a good book. However, I found out that the models needed more than one sheet of paper and would require gluing and cutting which totally turn me of. Obviously if you don't mind these kind of things and don't want any challenge then this book is for you"
3,"For fans of origami, medieval times and big projects","There are some confusing directions (such as the difference between a ""connector"" and a ""sleeve""and when and/or why to use each when assembling the castles). My son loved the castle I made, but I'm sure he doesn't realize the hard work involved in making what for him is a big paper toy. Still, it was a worthwhile project for me and I'm glad I tackled it. I never made any of the figures, so I never experimented with laminated papers. Maybe another time..."
4,Quality suspense fiction - for fun,"Watson's books in general are small town suspense. This book differs only in that the narrator is a teacher rather than a sheriff. Watson's strength is the complexity and authenticity of his characters - less true in this novel than Montana 1948 or White Crosses. The plot is well constructed - a serial killer in a high school. However, Watson does not write a traditional mystery - he is concerned with whodunit but more interested in exploring the effect of serial killings on the community - making and breaking relationships, suspicions of any ""other"", fear of the next death.Well written and entertaining - curl up and read for fun."
2,This one is not as good as his others,"In a Dark Time by Larry Watson does not measure up to two of his other novels which I've read: White Crosses and Montana, 1948. In this novel, the narrative is that of a school teacher's daily journal, one in which he details his observations concerning the recent murders of three girls from his school along with his encounters with some of his fellow teachers. The feel and flow of the story is poor. Even Watson's attempts at bringing the reader into the psychological stance of his narrator are weak. Compared to White Crosses, this first novel of his falls sadly short. Clearly Watson is a writer who has gotten better with each successive book.I found myself struggling to get to the end, asking myself if indeed the payoff would be worth the labor of the read, and when I reached the end finally, found myself as bored as I had been while in the thick of it all."
4,True,I liked this triology. 3 stories that tell the truth about years ago and blacks enduring discrimmination.
4,Not the Usual Ballet Suites,"Leinsdorf has devised his own suite for this stellar recording, which includes more than a couple numbers one never gets to hear unless you own the entire ballet. There are plenty of excellent performances of this music. Some of my favorites are Ancerl, Mitropoulos, Chung, Prokofiev. Five stars for the Romeo and four stars for the Lt Kije Suite.I can't say much for the Mahler symphonies Leinsdorf recorded in Boston but this is horse of a different color. Vintage sound."
3,Light bulb,I purchased these bulbs based on the ad saying it was a 24 pack of bulbs. To me this means 24 packages of 4 bulbs. Not (6) 4 packs of bulbs. A bit disappointed. The price was not much better if at all then what I could have gotten at Home depot or Lowes.
2,I regret buying this.,I thought this would be a cool compilation fo wildlife/ survivalist recipes. It certainly is not so. Very disappointed !
3,Great for the Mary Higgins Clark crowd.,"Two Nancy Sterns are living in the same luxury NYC highrise apartment building. One is a boring, mousy preschool teacher and the other is a beautiful, glamourous journalist. Mousy Nancy starts to mistakenly receive mail, flower deliveries and phone calls for Barbie Doll Nancy and decides to try on the glamorous lifestyle for a change. She accepts a date meant for the other Nancy and then the hijinks begin. This is a book written more for the Mary Higgins Clark crowd rather that the Bridget Jones/Jemima J. generation. No sex or violence to speak of, along with a highly unlikely fairy-tale ending made this book just a bit disappointing."
4,"Good, light read","This is the first book by Jane Heller that I have read. I found it to be a light, entertaining read, definitely worth my time. I found the characters enjoyable and the plot not too terribly predictable."
2,I beg to differ,"No, I'm sorry--I like a romantic, funny read as much as the next person, but Name Dropping had me wanting to throw the book across the room in frustration. Teacher Nancy was so totally inept in her celebrity-interviewer pose that no sane guy would have asked her out a second time. Lots of unanswered questions about celebrity Nancy, and some ridiculous scenes including one where teacher Nancy tracks dog-doo across an apartment (she didn't notice the smell coming up on the elevator?) on a mission of subterfuge. A plot line fueled by ridiculous misunderstandings and dishonesty."
3,"Light and Funny, a good beach book","Jane Heller's novels are always quick reads. This one raises an interesting idea. The leading character is a nursery school teacher with a boring life. A glamorous new neighbor moves into the building. They have the same name, Nancy Stern. Nancy gets a peek into her new neighbor's world and nothing is ever the same. I really enjoyed this book, it was entertaining and that is all it needs to be."
3,Mediocre,"I've read a few Jane Heller novels now, but there were none I liked as well as An Ex To Grind. Name Dropping is no different. The mother-daughter thing reminded me of her other novels, and it seems that she follows a pretty tight formula. The Epilogue was completely unnecessary as well, and I was anxious to get through it. Also, I didn't feel any real connection between the characters. It appears that I've had my fill of Jane Heller novels."
5,"CHRIS, it says it all","Love the man and his music,,,,do have one wish,,,he is on tour now,,,shame he isn't coming to the States,,,great CDMary"
1,"Sandy, no popcorn at all","This product is terrible - it has a sandy consistency (no popcorn type aggregate). It is thick, and when you put it on the ceiling you can create some ""popcorn"" by dabbing it with a paint brush or other method, but as it dries it evens out, and you end up with smooth mounds that look nothing like popcorn finish. I tried this only because my local Lowes store stopped selling the popcorn patch material I used to buy. Some popcorn fell off the ceiling when replacing a light fixture, and frankly, it looked better just painted white. This smooth, lumpy finish seems to be even worse."
2,Butchers good songs,"Why did he have to butcher I Only Have Eyes For You? Why?? I don't love this guy, - his voice is ordinary and his style isn't my particular favourite. They play this at work sometimes and that is the only reason I've had this misfortune of hearing this, but I can tell you now, I'm no big fan and I wouldn't rush out and buy this until he got singing lessons."
1,Difficult to follow and ultimately boring,"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this book. It appeared to have all the elements that I like...a gothic mystery set in the past in a dark cathedral town. Anyway, I struggled even to finish this book and found it ultimately unsatisfying and really very boring. I can't recommend it even a little."
1,DULL,"In all fairness, maybe I should not review this book, because I did not finish it. I only got half way through. From reading the cover of the book, I expected The Unburied to be suspensful and have me on the edge of my seat. I kept hoping it would get better, but every page became harder and harder to get through. The monolouges and naratives rambled on forever and did not go anywhere. I felt cheated of a good story and out of the money I paid for this book."
2,Texas Rain,"I love Jodi Thomas and have read all of her books, but this one was a big disappointment. I am wondering if she used a ghost writer. I have read and reread her books many times, but this is one I would not read again. It was rather boring. I am hoping the next book of the trilogy is better. I could not stand the heroine and I really liked the sister and the brothers better than the two main characters."
3,"Interesting, but Over Priced","I liked the book, althought some of the sections seemed stretched. My only real complaint is over the price ... . Pulling the pamphlet sized book from the Amazon box left me feeling a bit cheated."
2,"A great paperweight, but a mediocre introduction to Java.","The first 13 chapters offer a well-written introduction to the Java programming language. Unfortunately, there are more than 13 chapters left. It's as though the authors found themselves uncomfortably close to a deadline halfway through the book, and slapped the rest together with little pedagogical consideration. It has a terse 300 page reference that is occasionally useful"
2,"Full of errors! Poorly organized, poorly conceived!","Open your eyes! Look past the hype, the advertising and the non-stop promotion schemes. Lemay has managed to turn a mediocre style and extremely thin technical knowlege into a career writing poor quality books that are consistently full of errors. I found more errors in this single book than I've ever found in any other book. When errors are in the code as well as the author's discussion, mere mortals like you and I have little chance of actually learning Java. As far as learning Java in 21 days, it simply cannot be done if you use this book. Beyond errors and other problems, the book fails to cover many key issues. The entire toolkit for graphical interfaces is glossed over and examined so briefly that you can't possibly learn how to create applets that really do something. Definitely look elsewhere for your Java needs"
3,Decent book and decent introduction (for BEGINERS),"This book is probably No 1 book on the market as far as wider audience is concerned. The week one and two are excellent introduction to JAVA for a beginner. Third week is rather bad and written in a confusing manner - that needs to be rewritten in a new edition. So much for the ambition. For my opinion, week one is rather slow as well, but that is a matter of taste. The strongest part of the book is excellent graphical solution which is designed to ease the reading - compare to horrible Sun's publishing. Many times the authors forget how important is the presentation of material and this book is made in the manner that distinguished SAM's publishing. The book also suffers from misrepresentation - this is a book for beginner to casual user - not a serious programmer."
1,You get what you pay for: Spend a little more and skip this item.,"Usually, you get what you pay for. And with this Belkin surge protector, it's very true: It's inexpensive for a reason.Similar to another reviewer, I also purchased a dozen of these for my work. That was a year ago. None were dead out of the box, but two of them are dead a year later, and they haven't had a tough life: Typical office environment, driving a simple laptop computer and a mid-size LCD monitor. Maybe a desk lamp or a small personal fan.The wall-hugging flat plug and the long cord are the only nice things going for this product. Other than that, it's garbage."
2,No on / off switch,"I should have looked more closely at the photo I suppose. There is no power switch on this, every other power strip I've ever had has one. Kind of annoying. The flat plug is great, should be standard on everything! And the cord is long. However, the unit itself is pretty large. Overall I would say keep looking for a model that is a bit smaller and has a switch. I can't comment on the surge suppression abilities of this unit."
5,"Linda Mowery, The Romance Reader",Brazen is the finest example of a Blaze book that I have read thus far. What sets it above the rest is simple: wonderful prose is combined with a sexuality that is accented by tenderness and emotional intimacy. It was satisfying from sultry beginning to tender end.
1,horrible!,This book is desperately in need of a good editor. There's the bones of a story here but it's buried in pages and pages of dreck. Lots of info-dump that tries to pass as story.
2,Not What You Might Expect,"I thought Seven Moves by Carol Anshaw was going to be an exciting, mysterious, psychological mystery.It wasn't. I thought the main character Chris Snow would be enduring the dangers of the mid-east in her search for her missing photographer lover, Taylor.She doesn't.This book's goal is actually to attempt to examine the relationship between the two women.However, it doesn't really succeed on any level, including that one.The author never fully tells the reader what happened to Taylor, the woman who disappeared, but she comes close enough you can surmise the answer.The thing I found the most disconcerting in reading this novel, was the fact the author chose to tell the entire book in the present verbal tense, which I found highly annoying, and more than a bit distracting."
1,Vile,"This is the work of a man who has clearly given up on life. Of course since the old routine wasnt working for him and he needed that summer house in Colorado, trust me he really did NEED it. He did what any self respecting egotist would do he published filth.What will he do for act two? Promote bestiality in a pristine woodland setting with faeries? One can only hope that a runaway 18 wheeler dashes any possibility of that ever happening."
2,burned carped,"Couldn't wait to get this product to fix my noisy carpeted floors. I read the reviews. One person note that the joist finder gets hot, and I made a mental note of this, however I did not know that it got hot enough to burn the carpet after two attempts at finding joist. initially i thought the marks that were being lieft on the carpet were just indentatiions that i would vacuum out later and kept working. As i finished i found that they were not indentations, they were burned/ melted carpet. So now I have a semi squeaky floor with a lot of burns that are visible and feel terrible under our feet. will need to change the wall to wall now that goes into hallway, i'll fix the squeaky floors when I rip it up. Should have stuck with noisy floors."
1,It didn't work for me.,"I watched this product work on ""This Old House"" and saw numerous 5-star ratings here on Amazon.com, but despite sinking approximately 20 screws into a 4' x 4' area of a squeaky bedroom floor per the directions, the squeaks were still there. I used a stud finder, their stud locating screw, and a tape measure, to ensure I was driving into floor joists, but the squeaks endured. I was disappointed, I truly expected this system to work. Returned it and lost $5.76 on return shipping fees. I'll pull up the carpet some weekend and use regular screws, with a head that can draw the sub-flooring down tightly against the joists."
5,Squeeeek no more installation tool,"Excellent product. well documented, easy to use. Stops squeeks and thumps in floor or subflooring without any damage to carpeting.I have been wanting to buy this device for about 5 years and finally got one.. Vendor was perfect with regard to communications and shipping.Thank You"
1,Didn't work for me,"I'm sure this product works in some situations, or it wouldn't have so many favorable reviews. For me, it didn't work at all. I drove a total of 26 screws four inches apart into three adjacent joists with absolutely no improvement in the squeaking. At that point, I decided to call it quits. Thanks to Amazon's excellent return policy, I was able to return the kit with the remaining screws without a hassle."
5,Great Product,"We read the other reviews and decided anything has to be better than the squeaky floor we have lived with for probably 5 years now. I bought this product and it has eliminated the squeak with minimal time, once we found the joist.One recommendation is to keep your weight on the board when screwing it down to take any gap out of the board. We can still hear the board a little loose under the carpet but the squeak is gone and we couldn't be happier. My daughter has lived with the squeak for years which means we could hear her in and out of her room (which might have been a good thing:) but we're so happy to have conquered the squeak without hiring someone. I called a flooring person last year and they wanted to charge me $250 to come out and probably do the same thing we just did w/this product. Thank you Squeak No More!!"
5,Worked like a charm,It took a few hours to find the right spots to cure the squeaks. The good news is now the baby doesn't wake up whenever we step in her room. Awesome! Thanks Squeek No More!
3,Not a religious Christmas book,"This is not a religious Christmas book. Everyone celebrating Christmas together and in peace... and wishing peace to all mankind regardless of religion etc. Many different religions mentioned. Very idealistic and all inclusive. If you are looking for a religious Christmas book, buy something else."
4,Solid follow up to the Legacy of Heorot,"Great tempo, well written, and exciting. This is Niven and Pournelle at their best. This novel will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Plenty of twists and turns."
2,Ho Hum!,"Books by the Pournelle/Niven team are generally among my favorites in the SciFi genre. Unfortunatly this is one of their few real ""duds"".Written as a sequel to Legacy of Heorot , the colonists planned investigation of the mainland from the island based colony started out as a great basis for a story. The ""old Grendel"" (obviously mutated) interaction with the exploring colonists borders on the absurd. My first thought after finishing the book was ""why did I even bother--what a disappointment""!I really enjoyed the first book ""Legacy of Heorot"" , but this second volume is but a pale shadow of a good first effort."
2,Would not buy again,"My husband and I started using this shampoo (and conditioner) two weeks ago. I did not find the smell to be anything more than pleasant. However, my hair is starting to look really stringy and oily. My husband, who has great hair, has developed dandruff. When I saw those flakes I started looking for something else."
1,Please Don't Fix Something When Its Not Broke,"The old version of this shampoo was awesome. It was, in fact, the only shampoo I could use without my hair falling out and scalp burning which sulphates in regular washes would do. Well now they messed up this shampoo literally. I have hair that reaches my rear and its like washing my hair with Crisco or some kind of lard. It's nasty. I've complained to Burts Bees and I dont think it makes much difference. The new bottle, by the way, is to prevent you from seeing the goop inside that wont rinse down the sink. Ive bought up as many bottles of the old version to just prolong the inevitable. But that's like the only thing I can think to do. This new stuff sucks."
3,smells nice,"Not as great as I thought, smells great, nt enough lather, and you need quite a handfull to lather. expensive for that much needed, and I have very fine hair. so if you have course hair . not a good idea"
2,Didn't work well with fine/oily hair,I felt like this really weighed my hair down and made it especially flat. I've totally stopped using it as a shampoo but it works fine if you use it as a bubble bath.
5,Hilarious book everyone can enjoy.,"It's an entertaining story for all ages, with both physical humor and more subtle humor. I've read some of the other Minnie and Moo books, and this one is far and above the best in my opinion."
4,WORD PUZZLES,"If you like word puzzles then you should get this game. I got this game for my nintendo ds which can also play game boy advance games.This game gives you puzzles such as: Crosswords, Wordsearches, Kriss Kross, etcI mostly brought the game for the wordsearches and Kriss Krosses since I like puzzles like that.I recommend this for word puzzle lovers"
4,Good but not Lee's best,"I am a major fan of all Edward Lee's books. Have read all that i can get my hands on. This is a good book but not as brutal,shocking and ""gross"" as some of his other works. Plenty of sex but a lot of the horror action seems to happen ""off screen"". Same with the gore.Not detailed and rather tame for this author. I enjoy ALL Ed Lee books and Succubi is no exception but if you are looking for this authors trademark hardcore style then try Header 2,The House,The Bighead or Family Tradition with John Pelan. These are delightfully disturbing books! Amazon has a very limited(in my opinion) selection of Lee's stuff available for Kindle so check out Ryan Harding,Wrath James White,and Tim Curran. All good writers but nobody compares to Lee."
4,"Solid, easy to use, vibrant color","At work, I use my laptop both as a portable laptop and as a desktop with peripherals. This means sometimes I move it around a bunch during the day and other times it sits all day long at my desk. I wanted a case that I could just leave it in all the time; and that's what I do with this case!There's enough room to plug in all my peripherals and the bottom of the case is almost flat to allow for cables 'n' stuff. It's very sturdy and solid. The sides zip up easily. I bought the orange one and the color is outta sight! I've had many positive comments. I'd give it 5 stars except... I wish they made them in different sizes. It's a bit oversized for my 13"" macbook.One thing to consider... if you're using it in meetings, you probably won't want to put it on the table, as it creates something of a barrier, as it's a bit tall, to accommodate the handles. I like to keep it on my lap, which works fine."
5,cleans!,"Impossible to find in local stores, this stuff works GREAT on glass oven tops. Its semi abrasive but just enough to get the stuff off.Get a pack of razor blades and carefully scrape the hard stuff off, then use ceramabryte to polish it up nicely with the yellow sponge scrubber.Great for glass shower doors too."
5,Astounding,"I have played the original Space Ritual to death for about 40 years, owning it on vinyl, on CD and the extended CD too. It is easily the best live album ever made, in my opinion, a relentless barrage of space rock that grips you by the throat, slams you into the wall behind you and holds you there it's entire duration.And yet........this release is even better. This is even more raw, even more powerful and even more relentless. This is a truly stunning artifact. No studio work was done after the fact on this so it is exactly as the concertgoer heard.I have seen Hawkwind four times, the first when I was a mere 15 years old and each time they were awesome. Good lord, though, how I wish I'd been at this one. Just astounding."
3,Rise of Nations,"Its fairly similar to other games of this genre. Lacks some of the humour and personality of similar games. Competent, reliably coded, and runs at a decent speed even on slower Macs. Multi-player games are fun."
1,Great game - but crashes all the time,"Really enjoy the game when it works, but it crashes so often that I can hardly play it. Using a PowerBook G4 with OS X.4.7."
3,A guide into Jim Morrison's psyche,"The Lords segment of the book had some good quotations and some very unique and enigmatic images, whereas the New Creatures did not make that much sense, at least read in a normal mindframe. There probably is a deeper meaning behind Jim's LSD/whiskey drenched verses, but in this book, many of his meanings are layered by either weird metaphors or incoherence. At the same time, it's also enigmatic and it makes you wonder what he was thinking or what he was trying to say."
5,Another Great Read...,I think Jim Morrison was well ahead of his time and his poetry reflects his ideas. Anyone who loves Jim Morrison and the Doors will enjoy this book thoroughly. It's definitely a book to treasure as are all his works.
4,This title is a must for any fan of poetry or of the Doors.,"When James Douglass Morrison wrote The Lords and the New Creatures, he had no idea the quality of the poetry he had written. This book just is a compilation of his first book of poety,The Lords, and his second book of poety, The New Creatures. Except for the fact that on the cover of the compilation is lists the author as Jim Morrison, instead of James Doulglass Morrison, the book is a classic. It would help to have read biographical information of Morrison to understand the poetry somewhat. I would recomend No One Here Gets Out Alive, or Riders on the Storm"
3,This is a very interesting collection of Jim's Poetry.,However it is not better poetry as found on the AMERICAN PRAYER album. Jim's poetry is very abstract and the meaning of the poems are often associative and difficult to understand. It is interesting because these poems were written while Jim was in film school and released while he was still alive. I am disappointed that the original cover was changed where before there was a picture of him wearing a beard which had him more poetic looking.
1,Same movie?,"Dear hell! Did you people see the same movie? Did I miss something? ""Well acted""? ""Great for kids""? For the love of all that's holy upon this green earth this has to be one of the worst traveling road shows caught on film! People in the theater were jumping off their chairs praying audibly that they might be lucky enough to land on their necks and die!!! Whole families were bidding tearful goodbyes to one another before leaping to their collective doom.One weary parent told me to take my children and leave: ""Someone's got to tell the story of what happened here!"" Luckily I did, otherwise no one but the ushers would know of the horror known simply as ""Slappy and The Stinkers."""
5,Bible,"This redline edition bible arrived as promised. It is not the first bible of this sort that I have purchased. The only thing is I didn't check the dimensions of the bible when I ordered it so it came smaller than I had expected. But, the bible is still great."
2,Not true to the to the listing,"I purchased this based on the print size and that it is leather bound. When it arrived, the Bible is stamped on the back with ""Premium Leather Look"" I am not interested in a Bible that will not hold up the continuous use. The cover is a heavy duty cardboard. I don't think it would last very long. I sent it back the day after we received it."
5,neat condition and fast delivery,really like its design and size.good to read when you are planning to read it from any places
3,NASB Thinline Zondervan,"Quality of binding from Belgium above average. Maybe a result of thin paper, but ink print bled through the pages and printing quality, although clear, is faint in some places. This makes it somewhat difficult to read. No references in this Bible. I bought for reading only."
4,Child Prodigy,"Try this, a 14 year old writes and plays every instrument on every song of a complete cd. That can't be good, right? Wrong. Bryce is one talented guy. And whoever said his lyrics are bad: I'll give you not godly, but they're not half bad.The only complaint about this one is some of it sounds the same. But what can you expect for just one guy?"
5,Favorite Need for Speed,"I bought this product for my PS2 after moving to college and not taking my Xbox with me. This is by far my favorite Need for Speed game. It has free roam, which allows you to just drive around not just to race. I enjoy the feel of driving the cars in this game a lot more than other games also. I'm able to control the vehicle a lot better. Very good game, highly recommend."
2,Need For Speed,Well it is a online game only and it did't say that when I bought it so it looks fun but who know. I will have to hook my online up to try it someday when I have time.
3,NFS: Most Wanted,"NFS Most Wanted is ok, but there are a few things I don't like about it. The variety of cars is mediocre, and the controls are horrible. How can you eliminate the old fashioned way of control by using the pad? I absolutely hated that. The amount of vehicles is horrible...only 37. In NFS Hot Pursuit 2, there were close to 50. I am not thrilled with the tuning feature, and what's the deal with the NOS? The way I see it, if you need NOS on your car, then your car isn't fast enough.I like the police AI, that's just incredible, and the 3d models of the vehicles are incredible. The gameplay is great and the combining of the elements from Hot Pursuit 2, Underground, and Underground 2 helps the game, but the variety of the cars hinders it."
5,Best NFS ever!,"This is the best NFS game ever, the police chases are awsome and alot more relistic then they were in Hot Pursuit, realistic sounding cop transmission etc. The carrer mode is awsome and so is the free rome mode. I give this game 5 stars easy."
4,Not letting my son borrow my car anytime soon.,"My son recieved this as a Christmas gift and after watching the chases that he gets in I'm convinced that he better not ever ask for the keys to my car. It is action packed, but what I like the most is that there is NO bad language. It's a game my older son can play with his 5 year old brother in the room. Thanks need for speed."
3,"High density module, may not work on laptop with PC100 bus.","This is high density SoDIMM modeul and it's the LOWEST price I've seen without going through rebate and coupon hassels.However, it's not compatible with my Dell CPx PIII 550. My laptop refuesed to boot. Well, bus speed was not the problem. I was told by a tech that my laptop cannot take the high density SoDimm (total 8-chip, 4 on each side; only the 16-chip, 8 on each side would work on mine) :(Ckeck with your laptop maker to make sure the your laptop can take the high density SoDimm. Hope this will save you some trouble."
1,Wrong title & description. AlsoIncompatible with IBM TP 390x,"When I purchased this memory a week back, Amazon had it listed as a PC100 memory. I received it after a long wait (10 days!) only to find out it's a PC133 and incompatible with my Thinkpad 390X 2626. I hope Amazon processes my return quickly.As for the chip, I purchased a Centon with same specs and it works fine in my PC100 system. According to the Centon tech I spoke to, they make their chips with backward compatible chips; unlike PNY."
1,Weird!,"I bought this poetry book from my local Borders expecting an exciting collection of poems from a relatively unknown author.I was very disappointed to be confronted with very poor poetry conveying weird and at times racist ideas. The content was really strange and seemed not to make any sense. I got the impression that the author is a very confused individual lacking in social skills and life experience. Some of the poems took on a sexual nature. The way in which these poems were written led me to the conclusion that Kim has never had a girlfriend because he seemed clueless when it came to analysing female behaviour and their relationships with men.A few of the poems presented racist and anti-Semitic ideas, which could cause offence to ethnic minorities and Jews. These poems were pretty awful in most aspects and should be avoided as a result."
5,"""A remarkable puzzle!""",My 3 year old daughter got this puzzle for Christmas and she simply adores it. This is her fourth Melissa & Doug puzzle and I have to say she loves them all. As soon as she is done with one she puts it away and runs for another one. Keep making wonderful puzzles Melissa & Doug!!
5,Made in America,I was delighted to find a floor puzzle of a farm for my 3 yo neighbor. She loves puzzles and also loves to play farm.
5,Fantastic puzzle!,My four year-old son loves this puzzle! The pieces are big and thick and the puzzle is the perfect size to fill our small table top. I helped my son put it together the first time and he can put it together himself easily now. This is our first big floor puzzle and now I want to buy a bunch more!
4,A little disappointed,"As a devoted Harry Potter fan, I chose this game as my first for the PSP. First, let me say that the graphics are awesome. You can choose to be Harry, Ron or Hermione. The game also follows the movie, as far as the tri-wizard tasks and all. The problem is, there seem to be a few glitches with the game.First off, the controls are unresponsive at least 50% of the time. This will cause you to cast spells to the left, while something is attacking you from the right. Or, you may get stuck in the corner and be unable to get out for about 30 seconds until the game begins to respond to the controls. This is something EA could easily have prevented.Secondly, you have to go into the same levels over and over and over again. You have to run around looking for tri-wizard shields. You must return to the same level again and again to retrieve the shields. This game is okay, but it's disappointing, because it could have been amazing. 4 out of 5 stars, for the effort."
4,General Track Listing & Time,Bad Religion - Punk Rock Song (4 Track Australian Import on Murmur/Dragnet Records [MATTCD 026] 1996)01) Punk Rock Song @ 2:2702) The Universal Cynic @ 2:1703) The Dodo @ 2:1204) Punk Rock Song (German Language Version) @ 2:27
1,Bad order filling,"I had ordered a 2 quart measuring cup and was advertised as such, when I received it, I got a 1 quart measuring cup. Very disappointing!!"
4,Better Than a Book,This product is kind of like a book with videos for chapters. You can not just press play and watch a movie. You have to click on each chapter to view it. It would have been nice to have a play all button but then again it would be too long. There is more than 6 hours here at least. You get your money's worth. Some categories do not seem to go too deep like Banking section. It just seems to skim this area though I learned how to upload bank transactions into quickbooks (great trick). I like this product but I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could have as some chapters seem a little rushed to me. Over all I do not feel cheated. A good buy for $$. I learned a lot and since I am not trained as a bookkeeper I needed to learn a lot.
1,Alpha is burning their discs now,"Just when you thought the DVD market couldn't get any worse, apparently Alpha is burning copies of their new DVDs. My copy of this film arrived and it was DVD-R. People on the DVD Bargain Forum are reporting the same problem with new discs from Alpha. The nice thing about Alpha before this was the material may be grade B, but at least you were getting a pressed copy. True no more. Alpha - If you are listening, your public domain material on a burned disc is worth almost exactly a quarter, not seven bucks."
2,Not too good,"I thought this was Boston Blackie, Chester Morris played Blackie and this came up when I was looking for Blackie. It's not and it's not really very good. I wouldn't reccommend it."
1,do not order this,Do not order this memory unless you need pc133 memory. It is not backwards compatible to pc100. Even check out PNYs site it also states this. Returned item. Did not get full refund even though package was sealed and ad was incorrect.
1,WTF!!!!!,Im not sure what happened with this radar gun...but it failed terribly!!! Out of the packaging it worked...sorta...it wouldnt pick up anything going by or towards it. Only when its held out and I spin in circles do I get any kind of reading on it at all. I think I got a POS..but im sure experiences will vary. I still dont recommend that anyone purchase this product until they step it up!!
4,Awsome Deal!!!,This package is a real deal and it includes items that are an absolute necessity for someone who is trying to get professional results from their camera!
5,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy,I order this for my grandson he is 8 yrs old and he has had so much with play's it all the time.
2,This Game Sucks like Blues Brothers 2000,"Let me start out saying Jedi Outcast was an awesome game. Great powers, Cameo voices by Billy Dee Williams(LANDO), and you went on a few missions w/ Luke Skywalker himself. The only returning characters from the trilogy that assist you through a level are Chewie and Kyle(your character from the last game). Bad Dialogue, stupid cut sceens, no graphic improvements. The only cool thing about Academy was you get to fight a little w/ Boba Fett, but of course, he doesn't die and he gets away so they can make another stupid game sometime. Bad ending, too many re-occuring enemies(like the same jedi assasin 100x ect)missions that are too easy, lots of glitching(you'll get stuck to the wall if you even touch it). Didn't get around to multiplayer, sold it to someone who wanted it. Stick w/ outcast or rent this game when it comes out on xbox."
5,Great game!,"I've got to say this right off the bat, I love this game!Even though it's a bit older than some of the newer SW games (Battlefront II, KOTOR I & II), I felt that the game was more expansive. Unlike KOTOR I and II, specifically, it is NOT a turn-based game, so there's no pause in the action during fights. And again, unlike both KOTORs, the world layouts don't have boundaries (basically you can go anywhere you can jump or fall to).The storyline is pretty interesting as well. You can decide whether you want to be a force for good, evil, or just remain neutral, and it's fun replaying the game to see how different choices affect the outcome."
4,Very Entertaining,"I really enjoy this game. The ability to choose how you character looks and the lightsaber he/she uses makes you feel like you are part of the story.The only problems are that you have to reset the game settings EVERY TIME you turn it back on and that if you don't have the right equipment in your computer, there are some annoying glitches."
4,Great game,"Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is the third game in the Jedi Knight series. I haven't played the first two, but I probably will after playing this game. The models in this game are very well detailed, and the graphics aren't too bad. The gameplay overall is very fun. The only downside to this game is that it is relatively short... maybe around 5 hours. However, I would recommend picking up this game."
2,These aren't worth even the cheap price,"I'm not entirely sure what I expected, but these aren't it. I figured that a terminal is a terminal, but these are cheaply constructed even for the price. The hardware has a loose fit and I am weary that the coating will not keep the bracket from rusting quickly in harsh environments like marine which is what I bought them for.Finally, the packaging was simply unacceptable. The box it came in was too big to keep all of the parts together and upon opening it every single nut and bolt was loose on the bottom of the box. Not the end of the world but it was just the topper of a bad experience."
1,It's amazing how some people are dumb enough ...,"to think ""reality"" TV shows people in a truthful light. I only hope the muttonheads who think that any of the ordinary people on Project Greenlight were depicted in an accurate light grow up and grow up fast. This is the Hollywood meatgrinder in action--anything and anyone for a buck. The fact that people were duped by this only underscores how right P.T. Barnum really was."
4,Release with reprints of original stories,I would like to see these released with reprints of the original comic books. Cross-marketing further... has anyone noticed what the Marvel Super Heroes bubblegum cards sell for on eBay? Reprint the cards (of course in a way that they can't be confused with the genuine 1966 cards) and sell us a set of the cards with the DVDs and the reprint books. It'd be like printing money...
3,Cuisinart Hand Mixer - disappointing,"(I don't know why the review is showing three stars. I gave it one star.) I bought this mixer when my old $10 Betty Crocker finally went up in smoke after 14 years. I based my purchase decision on Cuisinart's reputation and on the convenience of having a timer right on the handle. However, the mixer shakes so hard that it's nearly impossible to read the timer, and the unit is too heavy to use comfortably for the amount of time it normally takes to mix a cake. I even chose to mix cookie dough with a fork rather than drag this clunker out of the cabinet. Maybe Williams-Sonoma will let me return it.**Update: W-S let me return the mixer and I bought a KitchenAid 5-speed hand mixer. It's much lighter-weight and works just fine."
3,Autobiographical Fantasy,"I was pleased to note that I am not the only one who goes through the obsessions and compulsions, but found that too much information was omitted by the author. He seems to feel that he has only had one or two relapses, and that he does not need medication (he's definitely an ""anti-med"" kind of guy) to get better.Besides that, he only went into one way that the therapist was able to help him, which left me wondering ""How is this guy getting through daily life by making himself wait 5 extra minutes to straighten the carpet fringe????""Before I read this book, I was determined I needed to be on meds to get better. Now that I know that there are other options for recovery from OCD-- like those discussed by Marc Summers-- I am now even more determined that I need meds."
5,A true classic!,The Origonal Parent trap is by far the best! Haley Mills outshines the second version of The Parent Trap.
4,OLD FAVORITE DISNEY GREAT CAST!,"This has always been one of my favorite Disney live action films. Haley Mills does a good job with her double duty and O'Hara and Keith are excellent as always. The Vault Collection version is a worthy puchase, sure they could have cleaned up the print more,but it looks pretty good and there are lots of extras. Disney has been guilty of not doing there films justice anyway. Other than a few of the animated gems, they have release sub par fullscreen and dirty prints for years."
5,"""Let's Get Together With The Parent Trap""","Hayley Mills stars as Sharon McKendrick AND Susan Evers in this classic 1961 Disney film. They meet each other at summer camp accidentally,thinking that they look-alikes.They are! By switching identities,they get their parents together. Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith star in this classic comedy. Songwriters Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman write three songs in this film: the title song sung by Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello,""For Now,For Always"" sung by Maureen O'Hara, and ""Let's Get Together"" sung by Hayley Mills. The song was also sung by Funicello in the dance scene. Lindsay Lohan took over Hayley's roles in a 1998 remake of ""The Parent Trap"". You can also hear her sing ""Let's Get Together"".This movie is fun for all ages!"
4,"A Fun, Spirited Adventure Starring Hayley Mills","In the original movie, The Parent Trap, Hayley Mills stars, twice! As twins, not knowing about each other's existence, who meet at a summer camp where they immedietly dislike eachother, until, of course, they discover that they are twins. In the course of all this, they switch places in attempt to reunite their parents, played by Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith. A fun movie to watch. Though perhaps not quite as colorful as the new version, it is a nice addition to your video collection, especially to compare to the new one. A must see movie that your whole family will enjoy."
4,"Not quite a masterpiece, but really interesting and well done!","I grew up near the place where this documentary takes place. Its been an urban legend since I was a freshman in highschool. Although there are parts in this film that make it hard to watch like some of the bad acting in the re-enactment scenes, but where it makes up is the incredible history about Caryville and the supposed hauntings. The narrative is done really well by all narrators, and the cinematograhy was done very well. You have to understand, this movie was made by locals from the area and with that in mind, I think they did a very good job. This is a very independent documentary and with that in mind, I think its worth it. I learned a lot about Caryville from this documentary, if you know about this town and are interested in the Caryville hauntings, then you should definately check it out. I could see this film being on Netflix streaming."
2,I really thought this would be better,"Based on the music on All Songs Considered and the fact that so many of the snippets NPR plays are songs I love, I was fully prepared to adore this entire collection. Sadly, it's far too bland. Tribalistas, Clinic, The Decemberists, Austin Lounge Lizards, are all bands I discovered thanks to NPR but the songs on these album live up to the stereotype of NPR being overly mellow."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"I bought this Metrokane Rabbit 6-piece Wine Tool Kit for my husband for Christmas in 2010, feeling sure it would be an excellent replacement for the Rabbit wine opener we had used for almost 20 years. WRONG! Just last week the handle broke off--after less than one year of not-heavy use. Just broke! In examining it, it looks cheap, so I should not have been surprised. Then I saw the reason: MADE IN CHINA. I think that says it all. I make it a practice never to buy anything MADE IN CHINA, not just because U.S. Corporations who outsource there use sweatshop labor--in many cases older children--but also because the products are inferior 95% of the time.I will never buy another Rabbit Wine Opener as long as they continue to be made in China."
1,Broke after first use,Received as a birthday present. After first use the spring inside one of the handles came out making difficult to close the handles. Returning set for a refund and buying different model.
1,So disappointed...,"I thought this item was going to be good considering the reviews it got, but honestly it sucks. Save your time, chip in a few more bucks and get yourself a good one."
1,It's never too late!,"Beautiful on the outside, but limited on the inside! Sweetie, you have too much in your favor, than to have stepped it down a couple of levels; your voice is nearly untouchable and your appearance is close to flawless. After listening to a few of your songs, I was sadden at the contrast in style between Addictive/For Your Precious Love (Ali Soundtrack) and other works that you've done; I know there is more to that mind than expletives! There has to be, being that you had an opportunity to attend the University of Chicago via Scholarship - that in itself speaks volumes. Don't get me wrong; I know my opinion counts for nothing in today's society, but after hearing a voice collaborating with one of hip-hop's all-time greats in Rakim and seeing its image on BET weeks later, truthfully, I expected better."
2,One good song.,"If you're looking for the throbbing style of ""Addictive"" save a couple bucks and buy the single."
4,Better of the New Commercial Urban Croonettes,"She does have a unique flavor going on. Singing over that exotic East Indian track is on target KAKOW! And that video is all that too! But she is so hard and mad on nearly every track that it's a little overkill. Much love for Cita ""the cyber diva"" on that one track."
1,Item arrived DOA,"The shaver arrived DOA. I charged it overnight and it would not turn on. Possibly a defective switch.I was so disappointed, I just threw it away..."
2,"Poor battery life, and not an efficient shave","I've had this shaver for nearly a year now and the battery will no longer hold a long enough charge to get both legs shaved. I suppose in part that's because it takes so *long* to get a clean shave. It's like mowing the lawn except to get all the hair gone requires lots and lots of back and forth, sometimes from different angles just to catch a few rogue hairs. Not the greatest product I ever used. Oh, and I can only use it on my legs, it tears my underarm and bikini-line skin to shreds, as others have reported."
2,limited use,"I got this as a Christmas gift and I have had frequent episodes of razor burn. It also requires lots of going over the same spots to get all the hairs. Last week one of the screens tore...to get them out to replace them did damage to the head in general because of the way it opens (hinges to one side) and rendered the entire unit inoperable. It is comfortable in your hand, otherwise I think I'll go back to the Panasonic brand."
3,"takes a long time, but works great","I've never used an electric razor b4, n when I opened the package I found the lil warrning slip saying it can take up to 3wks for ur skin to get use to it if u've never used one. I wasn't happy reading that but then it didn't apply to me. I've used it now 3x n have had no irritation. My problem with it was that it takes a lot longer then a regular razor (this is why I only gave it 3stars, I'm a single mom of a 15mth old n time is something I don't always have) mayb 'cuz I don't let the hair on my legs get too long; also it's very loud but overall I'm still happy with my purchase as it leaves my legs smooth n no razor burn."
2,Died in 10 months,"I bought this in June, 2010, and by April 2011 it had died, and not from excess use, either. I really did like the shaver itself, even if it didn't shave super-close. But a shaver is only as good as the charger, and that has failed miserably. To buy a new charger costs almost as much as an entire new shaver package. Go figger. I have to say no thanks to Remington."
3,Excellent buy for the money,"For the price I paid, this shaver shaves a lot closer than I would think. My legs felt pretty smooth even after the first time I used it."
1,to easy and boring and it sucks,"i read the book of this game and the book was good, but this game is a pitiful excuse for the name Harry Potter. I beat this game in 2 days. The graphics are not 21st century and it doesn't have anything the book does. The first task is lame and easy. The second was a little harder bit still lame and the third was just lame and easy. Dueling Voldemort was easy. I beat him in 3 tries. Everything that happens after Harry gets out of the maze doesn't happen in the game. You immediately skip to the closing ceremonies. The Yule ball is a joke in this game. The bottom line is that this game is too easy and the graphics are lame. My advice is that if your going to spend $20 to $30on a game, buy a game for Gamecube or Xbox or PS2. Don't buy this game it sucks"
4,Absurd and Hillarious!,"An absurdist farce about the life of Fan Fanych, alias Etcetera; a thief in Stalinist Russia who is sent to the gulags for the supposed crime of raping an aging kangaroo in the Moscow Zoo. Narrated by the same criminal shortly after his release it begins with an elaborate interrogation and show trial where the prisoner begins to doubt his own memory. Followed by many years in the camps with a cohort of early Bolsheviks and his reminiscing of earlier escapades (Picking Hitler's pocket, and eavesdropping at Yalta, etc.)Yes, this is another story of a russian writer who has suffered through the senseless paranoia of Stalin's judicial system, yet the writing is original and the dialogue crude: I kept thinking of a Kathy Acker novel. The whole carries you along and definitely makes this an interesting companion to Solzhenitsyn, Brodsky, etc."
5,THE BEST OF BOTH CHRISTIE'S SLEUTHS,"This is the best of both Miss Marple and Poirot to have for your movie collection as it not only is a good introduction to the two great sleuths but also has ""extras"" about them as well as the author herself. A must have addition for any of Christie's fans. Also the actors. Joan Hickson and David Suchet, who portray the great detectives are the best. It is as if the great dame of mystery, Agatha Christie herself, used them as the models for her two best loved characters."
1,cinderella's dollhouse cd rom game,"soooooo bad. no educational value at all. mindless, awful, do not waste your $$. If there was an option for negative stars, that is what I would have rated."
4,"New loves, old faces","A grieving Scott Summers lost his true love Jean Grey, when she killed herself to save the world from the overpowering Phoenix. Now he's met Madeline Pryor, who has an uncanny likeness to his former love...very uncanny!Meanwhile, Wolverine prepares for his marriage to the Japanese beauty, Mariko; Storm gets a new look and becomes the leader of a unlikely group of mutants; Kitty starts exploring her love for Peter/Colossus; and an enemy seeks help from the X-Men.I enjoy ""From the Ashes."" The artwork is classic and the story is entertaining and adventurous. And this is a highlight in Claremont storytelling.If you're an X-Men fan, you'll like this."
1,Didn't work for me,"I put on about 4 coats of the primer, and the magnets stuck OK, though they wouldn't work through a piece of paper. I then put two coats of paint over the primer and the magnets would not stick anymore. Wasted my money."
5,Wine opening kit,"ordered as first prize for sine tasting. Winner was very happy to receive. The only complaint is the plastic 'box' the kit came in was dusty and a bit scratched up... all over. otherwise, it was great."
3,I thought it would be great...,"I bought this a few years ago, when it first came out, as a gift for my parents. As they get a little older, I thought an easy-on-the-hands alternative to the conventional corkscrew would be great. It comes in a pretty box, too - which makes it seem like a great gift. But, because it can seem a little intimidating and harder to understand, my parents struggled with it a bit, and then put it away... never to be seen again. This is a costly gift - so make sure the intended giftees will appreciate it before you purchase. PS: I plan to steal it back from them for myself."
1,Don't be fooled,"If you are looking for a well functioning opener, this is not it! Much better ""rabbit"" type openers are on the market. First is the fact that it is mostly plastic, not metal, so don't be fooled by the metallic appearance in the photo. When opening the first bottle, (with normal cork). I noticed it was much more difficult to use than the old one (other brand) I had. It required extensive pressure to insert the cork, to the point I thought the flimsy plastic handles would break. Then I opened a second bottle with a plastic cork. This almost broke the opener when using upward pressure to remove the cork from the bottle. And after finally getting the cork out of the bottle, (it took two people), the cork would not come off of the screw. I had to manually untwist the cork from the opener. Save your money, spend a little more and get a real opener. This one is nice to look at but not functional! Real Junk, and not cheap!!"
1,Cheap plastic immitation,"I purchased three of these as gifts this summer, and one for myself.It is made of plastic, and works correctly one of 4 times. The little screw on cap which makes it function pops off routinely-very poorly engineered and made."
4,Great Wine Opener,"We received this wine set as a gift 2 years ago and loved it. We used it so much (several times a week) that we actually snapped the handle off, though I don't believe it was due to poor product quality, but instead because we opened thousands of bottles with it and it was bound to give. We liked it so much that we bought the same exact one when it broke. I only gave 4 stars because, of course, it did break. But other than that, it is definitely a good purchase."
5,Best corkscrew on the market,"I purchased the Metrokane Gift Set for my husband who has always struggled opening wine bottles. You have no idea how easy this corkscrew is to use, no more pieces of cork in the wine and 1-2-3 the cork pulls right out without having to strain or pull a muscle!.. It's about time someone came out with a great gadget such as this one! Thank you Metrokane!"
2,Broke - poor customer support,"Mine broke after only about a year. I contacted Metrokane, who gives you the name of one specific person... They wanted me to pay the shipping to send it in, plus $15 shipping & handling to get a new one sent back to me--not worth it. Kind of lacking customer service when it costs as much as a new one to get a warranty replacement.As far as the rabbit itself... it's nice. It takes up a LOT of cabinet space, though, so I prefer a regular waiter's corkscrew. You could fit 25 waiter's corkscrews in the space this thing takes up."
3,It works fine...,"I bought this for my stepdad over the holidays. At the time, the normal price was listed at $110, and it was on sale for about $55. Because of it's original high price, I expected something that felt much more high quality. I was under the impression that the whole thing was stainless steel. However, most of the pieces feel like plastic, and it was made in China. The case is also lightweight plastic and feels pretty cheap.Even though it feels cheaper than the price would indicate, I give it 3 stars since it seems to be getting the job done well enough. I was just a little embarrassed to give this as a gift, thinking it would be more high quality."
1,Over-priced Waste of Money,"I paid $50 for one of these at my local wine shop. After three uses (yes I said three) the little plastic piece near the the cork screw broke off and it wouldn't work. The wine shop said to send it to the manufacturer. Instead of going through that kind of inconvenience I decided to write this review and never purchase one of their products again. I bought a similar opener from Ross for $12.00. Have been using it for the past year. I hate over-priced, brand-named crap like this...especially when it doesn't even last a week!"
4,Beautiful and Works,The tools work very well and looks great when I'm serving wine to my friends at any occasion. Great Gift.
4,Super Easy to use,Definitely lived up to it's promise of opening a wine bottle in 3 secs. I got this as a xmas gift for my dad and now I want one for myself.
2,YAWN-fest,"Tedious and tired. Lots of filler. Neither of the main characters are memorable, much less likeable. Reading this book was like being tortured with boredom. I've never been fond of Stephanie Laurens's writing style -- she draws out every little thing in a very talky way; she uses 20 words when three would do. But her earlier books were more spare and readable. Now each successive book is more and more labored. Plot lines seem re-treaded from earlier Cynster stories. Must every single person in this family be subject to murder plots and blackmail?This one is the worst -- the diplomatic/political angle had her explaining every nuance of every word and gesture the characters used. Where was the editor on this book? Deleting a good 40% chunk of text would have done this book some good. Read in current state only if you need a nap."
1,"Too much sex, not enough story...","This is my first book by Stephanie Laurens and I didn't even finish the book although I did get as far as page 267 (about 3/4 of the book). The writing was good, but just one darned graphic love scene after another. After a while it gets very boring... they've been there/done that! The actual storyline was so flimsy that after reading 3/4 of the book I was still able to put it down and not pick it up again.I'm not against explicit sex if it moves the story along and is an intricate part of the story, but this was totally overdone."
2,Not my type of romance,"I thought this romance was boring and predictable. The characters were hard to care about, and there was a lot of gratuitous sex. I had to make myself finish this book , which is never a good sign."
5,Japan in a dishpan,"So refreshing, so inventive and invigorating thats what I could sum up when listening to this brilliant CD. If you like bands like ooioo youll love this spark of life."
4,wow,"Many bands from Japan are really good or novelty acts. X-girl is a really unique band who sings in both English and Japanese. Nothing is awkward. Nothing is keeping them back. This band has been together since 1997. Each member sings. They are quite entertaining as a live act. The wear costumes, makeup, and head masks. Hoppy Kamiyama who is more known for his efforts in Japanese noise produced this album. This album combines pop and noise. It is not quirky at all. ""E-Sa-Ya"" sounds more like Japanese folk music, rock, and classical. ""Pretty You Ugly"" is more punk. ""Pujeva"" is a cool electro track that is more like Cooler Kids. They offer a bunch of interesting sounds. This may be a band to check out anyway."
5,DoD PMBOK and much need extension to PMBOK,"I use this book often in our PMO for Defense and Civil space systems and find it a much needed replacement for PMBOK.First a previous reviewer claimed that this book is $9. It is actually free (in PDF format) from the DoD acquisition community site. Second the percentage change is reverse the previous. About 70% is new.Either buy if you want a bound version or download to make your own book, because...1. The areas of PMBOK that are vague and comfusing, lacking implementation details have been replaced.2. The over simplification of spiral development is replaced with the standard Phase A/B C/D incremental PM processes3. Much of the generalization in PMBOK has been replaced with specific actionalable outcomes."
3,VERY SMALL,"I got these as a photography prop so I am not worried about a choking hazard, but I definitley WOULD NOT allow my 22 month old to play with these! they are so small!"
3,Nice blocks,"The only surprise is that are very small, but my 20 month old baby likes it, I think it is a little confusing when you tray to asociate the pictures to the letters because there are not related, but there is plenty others ways to learn with this blocks"
4,blocks,"My grandson loves to put the blocks in an out of the bag, howvere I thought the blocks would be bigger."
1,Blocks to small,"I was expecting the standard 2"" blocks. The blocks are a little more than an 1"" square. I bought another set to give my grandson."
2,Not my idea of fostering language developement,"Although these blocks are durable and have the traditional die-cut letters, I am very disappointed in the oversight of what I perceive to be an elementary necessity. The problem with this blocks is that although they have letters and pictures on each block, is that the pictures do not correspond to the letter on the block. I think that it is important for use for years to come to not only have a basic fun and building value, but to be able to foster language development when the time comes. I have a problem with the letter ""P"" block having a picture of a bee on it, how am I supposed to explain that when the question arises? If you are only going to be using these blocks for a young child and not keep them to teach them as they age, then they serve that purpose, but if you are like me and want them for longevity, then pass on this set."
1,Very small,"Despite being a Melissa & Doug product, these are some of the most disappointing alphabet blocks I've encountered. They are really tiny, probably about 20 millimeters square, meaning each block is no bigger than a U.S. quarter. There seems to be more choking hazard to this toy that actual fun or building block system components."
2,latch defective,"The closing latch would not work on this pan. It would get stuck on the hinge. Perhaps a defect of my particular piece, but we returned it without even getting to use it."
2,Disappointed!,This CD sounds like something that would have been made by Mr. Rogers. The music was not catchy or upbeat. My kid was completely disinterested and I could barely tolerate the songs myself. I also did not think the CD concentrated on the phonetic sounds of the alpabet.
1,failed to work only after about one week,"I hooked up my PC with my Onkyo HT-RC370 Receiver to transfer the vedio to TV screen. It worked nicely for about 5 days. I did not change resolution and made any modifications , but after about one week, my receiver indicated there was no signal from my PC and the TV screen was blank blue. I rebooted my computer, the Windows logo appeared for couple of seconds on my TV screen, but turn to blank blue screen again when the PC is up running. This problem was not due to my Receiver because when I connected my PC directly with TV, the same thing happened."
4,Great Drumming!,"This is an excellent CD. For those who are interested in African dance, this is an excellent practice CD (nothing replaces live drumming for dance class). My only concern is that some of the labeled songs (rhythms)appear to be labeled incorrectly. For example: KouKou drumming sounds more like Lamban (the KouKou tape was to slow for that dance but perfect for Lamban), there were a few other examples like that, I could be mistaken, but one should investigate it for themselves."
1,Inner seal missing product all dried up!!,"My husband used this product for years when we could get it at the drugstore. Then they stopped carrying it. I searched the internet for it without success. Then I saw it on Amazon. It always was expense and on Amazon more than I remembered, but my husband really liked it, so I ordered it. He hadn't opened the jar until last night and found that the pads had completely dried out. The inner seal was completely missing! What a disappointment since the window for returning it has closed. My loss, don't let it be yours!"
4,Fire Truck Floor Puzzle,"My 3 year old loves this puzzle and plays with it frequently. The pieces are big which makes it easy for little hands and the puzzle is large enough that he can easily put it together with a friend without getting in each other's way. We've taken it to friends' houses and daycare to share.The detail on the firetruck is good and realistic, unlike some more cartoonish fire truck puzzles/books/etc that we have.I would have given this puzzle 5 stars except for one crtique. The pieces do not stay together well. When my son first got this puzzle, he was more than capable of putting it together but would get frustrated by the fact that the pieces would come apart easily while trying to put another section together. On a table this probably wouldn't be as much of an issue, but for a large floor puzzle, there is more moving around and if the puzzle pieces were slightly more interlocking, it would be helpful--especially since it is designed for 3 year olds (and up)."
5,easy fun,My three and a half year old has had a ton of fun putting together this giant puzzle. The pieces are large and fit together easily. If your child loves fire trucks this is a great investment.
5,Great alternative to your basic puzzle,This puzzle is huge! It is fun to put together. I bought this for a 4 year old and the pieces are quite thick which I'm sure will ensure considerable durability over time.Paid $[...] for this with free shipping which I thought was reasonable especially when I saw the size of the pieces.
3,Death in Bath,"The classic detective story differs from the police procedural in that the characters tend to be part of a small interconnected group, and the artificiality of this device in Morag Joss' hands is obvious. There is also a trendy upper-middle-class aura which is rather off-putting. But her descriptions of Bath and its surroundings are spot on, and her leading character, a professional cellist, is well conceived. Indeed, some of the passages having to do with music and the blocks which so often prevent us from reaching it seem written out of first-hand experience and are quite moving. It is a pity that the nascent romance in the story has to be nipped in the bud at the end - but these days you have to write with at least one eye open for a possible sequel!"
1,Defective Unit,"Generally happy with this brand (I own many APC items). However, this particular unit had a defective plug that the phone line plugs into. Vanns, the reseller, would not replace or take the unit back as I did not notice the problem until a few days outside the 15 day return window. It was a very disappointing experience."
1,trips too easily,Everytime I used the wall switch the power filter tripped. This is a brand new custom home about a year old. I use several other line conditioners from APC and other makers and have no problems with any of them. APC claims that it trips due to voltage irregularites but the one I used to replace it doesn't act the same way????
1,Horror my A$$,I'm not a religious person but I am enlightened enough to know this movie is just wrong.Glorification of Sadistic pleasures. I bet you like your snuff movies too.
2,"NOT THE BEST ""HORROR"" FILM","THIS WAS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST ""HORROR"" FILM EVER MADE. IT SURE HAS SUSPENSE AND THRILLER BUT HORROR? NO IT DOES NOT. WHEN WE WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE TO THE THEATRE I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. TO ME IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME, I WOULD NOT EVEN BUY THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT. IT IS DEFINETILY NOT WORTH IT.V/R"
2,"Masochisitic, with no thrill.","The movie wasn't thrilling nor suspenseful. I felt as if something was missing. However, it was kinda interesting and the end wasn't bad. It is a truly masochistic film. The characters were colorful. The acting was good and believable.Rating: Children should not see this film (nudity, drugs, violence galore, sex, & murder).If you like watching violence with no motive, a crazy murderous family on kiling sprees and how they live, then watch it. The characters were definitely interesting and unusual and that kept me interested enough to watch the film. This family is totally deranged, masochistic and sociopathic but they stick together through thick & thin. You never know what or who they'll do next, and this is why the film is so interesting."
2,"Mean spirited, no sense of humor, boring","My title here sums it up. What I loved about the first Zombie film was the mix of horror, humor, a taste of the occult, and the visual originality. Rejects, however, is humorless, near-pornographic but without suspense, disjunct and meandering, unimaginative and boring. If it were not for Ms Moon (Baby), who is just knock-down gorgeous, I would not have watched the whole thing."
1,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?,"WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!! there is such a thing a gore. But taking it to the max is retarded. In this worthless film, they take killing to the next level that is just wrong.It is about three freaks who roam an open road just waiting to seek and destroy. Do they finally get caught after the sick little game they played in the first one. (House of 1000 Corpses)If you dare to see it, go ahead.Now, I must say. If you liked House of 1000 Corpses, you will like this one. But if you didn't, same goes for this one. There is a thing called a little too much, and thats what they display in this movie.( 0 stars, but I had to give it 1)"
1,El Stinko!!!,"Interesting cast (Ken Foree, EG Daily, Priscilla Barnes, P.J. Soles) doesn't help this movie from being anything more than a sequence of meaningless events. Rob Zombie didn't learn anything from the first movie in terms of how to tell an interesting story."
5,American Psychos: House of 1000 corpses revisited,"I passed upHouse of 1,000 Corpses, many times, when I worked in a movie store, because the cover was freaky and the special packaging was gruesome. I never rented it. However, I watchedThe Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), and loved the movie. A coworker explained that this was a ""part two"" ofHouse of 1,000 Corpses, so I gave it a chance.I not only enjoyed the movies, but I must admit that thess are now some of my faves. I also purchased the following items related to this flick;House of 1000 Corpses (Soundtrack, Explicit Lyrics),House of 1,000 Corpses, and [[ASIN:B0009SCUXIThe Devil's Rejects (DUALDISC, EXPLICIT LYRICS, SOUNDTRACK))].After seeing the Rob Zombie films, the soundtracks have a life of their own. I've become a big Rob Zombie fan over the past few years, and I recommend his stage performances, as well as ALL of his CDs and DVDs."
1,Disappointing.,"I was a fan of Rob Zombie's first film. It was entertaining and visually stunning (even if he did ""pay hommage"" a little too much). But this new one is horrible. His attempt at trying to make a movie that is public friendly, has left him with more of an arnold-stallone-action-shoot-em-up than an actual horror movie. You would think that the new one would be more sick and depraved than the first, but unfortunately it's just tame in comparison.I'm not saying don't see it. If you liked House.. then you might like it. Personally, I think it pales."
2,mediocre horror film/ bad house of 1000 corpses movie.,"i know i only have two movies to base my compaison on but the atmosphere is too different from the first and the characters arent the same. i understand you cant always get the same cast to come back in a sequel but rob zombie couldve at least get the guy who played rufus to at least lower his voice a little, i mean did he get his nuts cut off or something? and whats with all the daylight? the atmosphere just isnt scary. and then theres all the people who said ""wait til you see how demented the clown is"" the only thing demented about spalding is he sleeps with a fat chick. even the victims characters are dumb. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i got to see sherri moons ass and she is hot!"
1,Sick movie for even sicker minds,"I picked this movie from the very limited list of freebies that came with my Sony blu-ray player. I'm glad I didn't pay for it.No redeeming qualities whatsoever, I, with a taste for horror, sci-fi, zombie movies and the like found this revolting. No wonder our society is ""f""'d up. I shut if off half way through, and felt violated for the rest of the evening. Another mistake. It's going in the trash, where ""Saw III"" went. I guess this new generation of movie makers are all cut from the same no talent loser cloth.It's nothing more than sick freaks murdering and torturing hapless people who are in the wrong place at the wrong time.I can only hope that ""live by the sword, die by the sword"" might apply to the director of this piece of trash. If he thinks this is entertainment, maybe he should try experiencing some of this junk in real life.Don't waste your time or money."
1,"Yes, this movie is so bad that even the devil would reject it!","Thil film depicts ultra violence and gore. It tries to scare the audience with brutal ways of killing peoplebut the acting was so bad it's laughable. For example, in one scene a person was being killed with an ax. Thekiller hit his victim at least three times with an ax. The victim screamed and moaned but he continuedto talk! His face was covered with blood but it showed no pain at all. The make-up looked absolutely fake.It's so boring that I rejected it from the player after finishing two-third of it.There are much better horror movies which made me shudder. They are: Slither, Cabin Fever, 28 days later,Pet Semetery and the Grudge."
1,Sad,"Boring, meandering plot. Uninterestering villins and heroes. Terrible; terrible acting. Another Rob Zombie smash hit."
2,REJECTED! 4 OUT OF 10,"How anti-video game d*** Roger Ebert gave this movie two thumbs up is a total mystery to me, especially when there are much better options like Resident Evil: Extinction which he probably gave a low score to just because it's based on the games. This is basically how the film felt: 90% disgusting porn and dirty talk and 10% blood and gore action. The gore is fantastic along with the Lynyrd Skynyrd tracks, but the whole movie is about disgusting topics that I don't even don't want to go in to(It makes Hostel look like a Disney movie). Just avoid this movie people, it's not worth it."
1,"The only word comes to mind is ""HORRIBLE""...........","This is by far the worse movie I have ever seen....This movie was awful, just bad and awful...This movie need to be taken outside back and shot and buried....After watching this, it is worth the trip and gas back to Walmart for a refund...The Devil himself wouldn't want to watch this...Pathetic, Pathetic, Pathetic!!!"
1,watching paint dry,"bad acting, not scarry, not even gorey, nothing like all the reviews promise. There's nothing terrifying about this movie. And if you're thinking it just might be funny; you're sadly mistaken. It's extremely boring and an insult to every horror movie ever made."
1,No Soul-No Christmas Spirit,"I wanted to give this CD a 1/2 Star, but couldn't figure out how...This is, without a doubt, the most synthesized, elevator music, soul-less Christmas music that I have ever bought and listened to. The ""talent"" is limited to anything that an educated man can reproduce on his laptop computer. It is full of pre-programmed over-dubs, and full of unimaginative chordal progressions. So weak in imagination that you can almost feel yourself falling asleep on the good old Christmas Elevator. If you want ""good old"" Christmas Carols, look for Bing Cosby, or Andy Williams. If you want fun, exciting Christmas Music, look for Trans-Siberian Orchestra!TSO Rocks Christmas!!!Unlike Mannheim, TSO puts a lot of thought, creativity, and LOVE into their Christmas presentations. Mannheim puts a lot of synthesizer into covering for a lack of talent."
5,Mannheim-excellence,Still my favorite Holiday Music. I have purchased this item more times than I can remember. My friends here it and want a copy so it becomes a standard instant Christmas gift. Can't wait for next years' surprise.
4,Decent Book- Good Buy,"This book has some strong points and some weak points. The strong points are that it has an easy to read and easy to follow coverage of the essentials of VB.net. Someone with no programming background at all could understand the book. It also covers, briefly, some topics like software design, algorithms, etc. The examples are all spelled out step by step so that anyone who can read, can follow them.The weak points are that it does not go in depth enough on the topics it covers, and there are a few typos. All in all, though, I would say the book is worth the money and a good place to start with vb.net. However it is just a starting place. You will have to get another book to go in depth on many topics."
5,Experienced HTML programmer loves it,"I've been programming in HTML since the World Wide Web first gained popularity, and let me tell you something, this book is magnificent. It allows both the experienced programmer and the novice to learn the new HTML 4 Way, from simple tags to style sheets to JavaScript, this has it all. And for those expert programmers, this is a handy reference tool, as well."
4,good book,"Written about a battle that is little known. Book gave both sides feelings during this battle, from the confederates anger over armed blacks to the former slaves not wanting to return to slavery. Interesting book."
2,Too repetitive,Parts of the book were excellent but other sections read like it was written by a no-talent hack. The storyline is very good but this is the worst written Turtledove book I have read. I still recommend this book because the story is one that needs to be told but if a Reader's Digest version ever came out it could be 1/3 the size and not lose any information. Anything Turtledove writes is worth reading but this is the weakest book I have read of his.
5,A REAL KIDS BOOK,This was my favorite book 50 years ago and I was delighted to find it again. Naturally I had to get it and I wasn't disappointed one bit. It is filled with the kinds of mystery and adventure that every 8+ year old day dreams about while putting the reader right into the action.
5,Perhaps the most engrossing book I've ever read.,"Unbelievable memoir, one that stays with you and perhaps changes your perspective on life. Harry Wu brings a voice to those many Chinese who, arrested often without cause, spent and lost their lives in the grossly inhumane conditions of Chinese prison labor camps. The unjustness is beyond vast and continues today. This book should be required reading in college sociology, political science and history classes as it is unequivocally insightful and informative as well as meaningful. I hope that Harry Wu can continue to carry his important message in this newly adopted country that adores him and cherishes his very important work. We are listening, Harry."
3,Disturbing but a page-turner,"Having read Mary Renault's ""The Persian Boy"" a few years ago (I would have read this story immediately after if I'd known the two were connected), I was interested in reading this conclusion. While the characters involved were interesting, the portrayal of the woman in the novel is horrible. Nonetheless, I came away with two favorite characters in the novel: Phillip (Arridais) and Eurydike. Though Phillip is sometimes patronized and Eurydike is sometimes portrayed less than flattering, both emerge as fascinating characters. Though Eurydike may or may not like Arridais, she seems to have genuine care and concern for him. They emerge as the most likeable characters in the novel, though Bagoas is also enjoyable. The novel keeps the reader guessing to the end as to who is going to inherit Alexander's throne, but its questionable treatment of women keeps me from highly recommending the book."
4,Very good compilation of an underrated band,"I hadn't heard a Motels song in like 15 years until 'Only the Lonely' played last week on XM Radio. I was instantly reminded of just how much I enjoyed listening to the band back in the 80's.Unable to locate the 'No Vacancy' CD (it's apparently out-of-print), I purchased this compilation instead. It is very, very good - not great as I really prefer their later material over the earlier stuff.Few vocalists can belt 'em out with the raw energy of Martha Davis - she's terrific, as is the rest of the band.The music of the Motels has aged very well, and in a business overloaded with hype and hysteria, I can honestly say that this group is (for the most part) underrated. 'Suddenly Last Summer' is one of the best ballads to come out of the 80's, period.Recommended, and well worth the price of admission."
5,Very Good Just Takes Some Time,"This Album is very good but there is something about it that makes it special or different then other of John's albums. It has some very good tracks some from is bedrock albums. I think what makes this kind of different is because it has to deal with the movie. Both discs are about the same but I think that most people will be listening to the second disc more than the first because it has better groves. I personally like the second disc because of the last few tracks and especially the last drum'n'bass track called ""A Better Place"". I have other works of Digweed and Muir and this one so far is one of there best. But I think that they should have got rid of the vocals in some tracks. I think the reason why this album was not rated high by other costumers is because they expected a lot from Digweed, because I did before I bought this album. After hearing Hong Kong and Bedrock I would think this album would be amazing and it is, is just takes some time."
2,Don't Buy,For an expensive visor the quality of the shield is poor. The view through the shield is distorted because of the poor quality of the plastic. The clips are difficult to get over today's thicker sun visors. They feel like they might break off when used. Should have listened to those other reviews recommending not to buy this product. Would not recommend it either.
1,shoddy,"what a waste of material. I guess the idea was nice. not very high grade. I like the tint but images aren't clear. It's also pretty small. they do make soft visors for a reason. btw, I didn't buy it because I was going to use it for its supposed purpose. Also it was more then half off."
3,Good Book,Federation is a good book but I prefere the movie version of Zefram Cochrane from first contact as an imperfect human being who changes for the better rather than a perfect man.
2,"yadda, yadda","Generations and First Contact are five times better than this book. I have to say, the authors make Zephram Cochrane sound like a selfless, noble, perfect hero instead of just a normal, ordinary guy. I am getting tired of hearing every hero is noble, selfless, brave man who always risks his life to give a good contribution to the civilization.I love the movie because it truly defines Zefram Cochrane's charaxcter. He's not only a non-perfect guy but he's greedy and selfish.Yes, I admit this is a beautifully written book and I enjoyed reading it but you can't argue with the movies."
4,Another Repackaging,"This Sony Music Special Products release is simply titled ""The Archies."" This could cause some confusion with their first album released in 1968 with the same name. This is NOT their first album in CD form, but is in fact a repackaging of their ""Greatest Hits"" album, minus two tracks. Most of the better known hits are here; including ""Sugar, Sugar"" and ""Jingle Jangle"". As per usual though, there is nothing here from their last album ""This Is Love,"" which had a number of good tracks on it. Overall, the quality of this CD is very good, except for the very poor artwork on the cover. The last time I checked, Archie had red hair, not black! Still, this recording will do fine until somehow, someday, the original albums are finally released on CD."
2,The Bronxville Book Club,"The Bronxville Book Club was a quick read that got off to a good start. It grabbed my attention by introducing, and somewhat developing, the characters who I assumed were going to be the main characters in the story. While their shallow, self-centered lives are not my reality, I was becoming interested in their lives, nevertheless, and began to favor a couple of the less ""snobish"" characters. As I read on, I realized the book was coming to an end and there were too many unresolved issues. When I completed the reading, I couldn't help but wonder if the character who was being snubbed was actually the person who wrote the book and wanted to ""get back"" at her ""friends."" Overall, I thought the book was pointless."
5,"Excellent, overpriced","Ephraim has long been a favorite of mine among the saints, though he is sometimes a bit dark and unrelenting for the modern tastes. Still, there is very much a place for that in the faith. In the end, these are splendid devotional readings that are very much outside (and in my estimate, above) the thrust of most contemporary Christian devotions. These are, for the most part, hard, brutally honest poem-prayers that acknowledge and set out to unmask self-deception. They are good reading any time, but especially suited for seasons of penance and self-reflection.On the other hand, I must say the price quoted here on Amazon is outlandish. Just google the title up, and you'll find copies for far less than half what is stated here. Look into Archangel books or Skete dot com. I am unaffiliated with either, but I know they recently had the text for less than 35 U.S. dollars."
1,Disappointing Quality,"There was much hype about the new edition. In fact, our class went weeks without a text book waiting for it to be released. As I read the book, I found many inconsistencies and I began writing them down for clarification from my instructor. These ""inconsistencies"" turned out to be errors...some publication and some writer error. By the time we were finished I had 7 type-written pages of mistakes (my instructor sent them to the editor). I was disappointed that as a first year student I was able to find critical errors that editors should have caught. And to add injury to insult, the quality of the book was so poor that the binding broke and I have pages falling out. The book is literally split in two. You may not have a choice when purchasing this book (if required), but don't be afraid to question what you read...you may be correct."
1,Where's the Mac Expansion Pack? Huh?,"Zoo Tycoon 2 is a fine and beautiful game but Mac users are getting a BAD DEAL!! As of right now it appears we are not getting the Zoo 2 Expansion Pack that PC users are getting. When a company starts treating its most passionate users (and Mac people are VERY passionate about their machines) as second-class citizens, you're going to get some very [...] users. Macs are used more widely by kids than PCs. Do you not understand your customers? This game is a good one and Mac users already pay twice as much for it than PC users, so you are really testing our loyalties here.The least you game makers could do is let us KNOW if you will ever give us an expansion pack. It's incredibly disrespectful of your customers to leave us hanging."

4,Heart of Worship,"Beautiful, lovely album of praise. Some songs are a bit Rock 'N Roll and if you like this type of contemporary Christian music, you will enjoy this album. Personally, I prefer the quieter inspirational type of Christian music, but I still enjoyed this album overall and would recommend it to every Christian."
1,professional framer,"This tool belt sucks, even for the price. I only used it for about three months on the job before i switched back to my old pouch. It is made with very weak material. No matter where i put my chisel or screw driver it would pierce a hole in my pouch. I eventually had to stop carrying them which sucks because i use them all the time. The big thick padded belt looked great but has no over-lapping velcro attachments so it slips up and the nylon belt digs into you causing lots of discomfort. The suspenders are nice though. If you ask me, just go to home depot and buy a Kunys belt or spend the money and get the occidental leathers."
1,The Hungarian Cookbook: The Pleasures of Hungarian Food and,"I have owned this book for a long time, and frankly while the style of writing is charming and folksy, the recipes, I thought, were bland and did not duplicate a true Hungarian flavor.Which is too bad - I thoroughly recommend the George Lang book over this one. Although one might want to subsitute oil for some of the lard he cites for the basic cooking fat (which is what they use in Hungary), Lang's recipes taste like my Hungarian cousin's dishes."
3,amazing graphics and gameplay,"I bought this game new, and believe me it is worth it. The graphics are amazing. people say it's worse than nfs underground 2 because there's not enough customization in the game, but you really don't need to change your backlights, windshield, frontlights. But don't get me wrong, you can still custimize you car a lot.Most racing games don't have a plot and you don't know why you're racing, but nfsmw is different. in this game you actually know what your doing.replay value: three stars this is the reason i didn't give the overall 5 stars because the game is pretty easy to beat and once you bet it it isn't much fun to play.Overall this game is a must buy for racers!!"
1,THIS GAME MAKES ME SO MAD,"I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME TO COME OUT. I BOUGHT IT ON WEDNESDAY. HORRIBLE. I WAS HOPING FOR A GAME LIKE UNDERGROUND. THIS ONE HAS ONLY 5 LEGITIMATE TUNER CARS, THE REST ARE EXOTIC, WHICH IS COOL FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THIS GAME IS SO BORING. I AM REALLY MAD THAT I HAD TO PAY $50 FOR THIS PIECE OF CRAP. I ALREADY FINISHED THE GAME AND I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD IT A WEEK."
2,Move along. Nothing to see here.,"This low budget movie has good intentions, and poor execution.Cheesy special effects, and terrible acting earns this moviea D minus."
1,It broke only after a few uses,"I bought it and started using it only once in a while. After only about 6 times of use, the motor stopped working. I did not bother to send it back as I know it's going to be a waste of shipping fee and my time. Would not recommend at all."
5,Terrific,"I tend to take chances on CDs - and almost always am disappointed. There may be one or two good tracks, but after listening to the CD all the way through, I'm done with it - I don't want to play it again.Not so with this CD.I bought ""Cafe Society,"", put it on the CD player - and now play it daily. It's such a true joy to listen to a singer and think to myself ""Wow - this girl knows what she's doing."" And she does.Instantly, you zero into her pitch. Her pitch is awesome - always accurate, never falters. Her vocal tone brilliantly clear. Her phrasing is intelligent - while still being emotional. Lorraine Feather is clearly someone who understands the female voice - and enjoys ""playing"" with it. She is someone - to put it simply - who loves ""making music.""Her lyrics are also terrific. There's plenty on this CD to adore & recommend - but my personal favorites: ""Something Like My Own,"" ""Love Call,"" ""The Right Idea,"" & ""Cafe Society.""This is a wonderful, wonderful CD. In two words: Buy it!"
3,it's okay,"I've never heard the liars before this album. I'm always looking for new music to spark my interest. This album doesn't do it for me. First off, it's not very original. It sounds like a collaboration between Sebadoh and Atari Teenage Riot. Second, it's just not very good. It's more silly than anything else. Third, it doesn't sound like they tried very hard. I like all kinds of music, from classical to noise. I like experimentation.. I'm all for bands finding new sounds to play with, but there just doesn't seem to be much thought put into this album. I think they were more concerned with being edgy than they were with writing good music.All that being said, it's still better than most of the new music I've heard. I just wish that statement meant more than it does."
1,A Bad Experiment,"Liars has done some good work. I know everyone has their own tastes. I thought their earlier work was a lot better. This is very painful to listen to. The songs are not at all pleasurable to listen to. Now here comes my controversial statement... It is by far one of the worst indie rock albums I have ever heard. It may very well be the worst in my mind. No offense to any Liars fans, but this is really bad. There's nothing wrong with experimental music or trying new things. Maybe this is just a bad experiment. Liars are talented musicians, I mean if Angus Andrew can get a girl like Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, then he must be talented. But, this album is not up to par."
4,Fun for all ages (,"Ok, I admit I love playing with Legos and Megabloks. It's my firm belief that you're never to old to Lego. Anyway, I bought a couple of these models for myself and enjoyed putting them together. I enjoyed even more, combinig the two sets and making an even better looking mech. For some real fun, combine this with the U-240 Assault, and the Night Force Optic. For fans of big walking robotic warmachines, these are just Great!"
4,Nice balls,"These are ok, I'm not sure if there is actually a flavor to them. They are nice and the fuzzy doesn't come off as easily as normal tennis balls."
1,Sending back,I purchased several packs of these for dog clients' christmas gifts...and gave some out early. One owner called to say her dog chewed into one of the balls and became very ill. These are made in China and I know a while back there were several recalls of dog things made in China because of illness and deaths to dogs.I opened a packto check them out I was overwhelmed by the smell of awful rubber...like an old tire. We had to call all our clients who got their gift bags early to warn them of potential harm to their dog. We are collecting the gifts back (how embarassing) and returning them a.s.a.p. I am very sad about the whole thing because had the product been made correctly it would have been a great gift.
1,Terrible item!,"I just received the dog tennis balls today, with in 1 hour the balls went to nothing! Very bad item! It was a waste of good money! A very upset buyer!! I would give this item a 0 if I could."
2,Unedited and boring,"Unfortunately, this novel has missed the mark completely. Ms. Robbins spends a tremendous amount of effort naming brands and places (although her grasp on the places is a little worrisome - people wander in Paris and see sights that are miles apart, as though they are across the street from one another), but her characters are weak, and the plot is weaker. The novel reads like a note passed in class by a 16 year old girl; it has everything except exclamation points and smiley faces. This one isn't worth the time spent to read it, and I wouldn't have finished but for the long plane flight with bad movie options.The book also would have benefitted from a careful reading by an editor before publication. This might have eliminated sentences such as, ""I was hesitant to return the preceding day to check on the princess, as I feared a repeat of the following incident."" It reads even worse in context."
4,A great collection for all those who love the 80's,"Overall this 5 CD set has a little bit of everything. I specifically bought this CD Set for the 1985 Smash hit ""We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off"" by the late Jermaine Stewart. This is a great song!!! Also has some good hits such as ""Tarzan Boy"" by Baltimora, ""19"" by Hardcastle, ""Reflex"" by Duran Duran, and ""I Got You Babe"" by UB40"
4,nothin big....just anotha classic as usual,"DJ Screw is the innovator and origianator of...chopped music. Don't let nobody else tell you different. My favorite tracks on here are #2 ""ESG - Ballin"", #3 ""Guerilla Maab - Fondren and Main"", #4 ""Fat Pat - Tops Drop"", #5 ""Grace - Ride Wit A Playa"", and #9 ""Big Moe - City of Syrup"". The intro is tha truth, Screw has changed many lives thru his tapes, includin mine. RIP Screw and Fat Pat...I hope y'all up in Heaven makin mo...tapes"
1,If it's your only choice... pass it by,"I was in the PX at Camp Arifjan looking for a book on Iraq before heading there, just so I can learn a little more about the people I'm going to be working with and training. There was only one selection, and although I have been able to gleam some useful information between the anti-American diatribe every other paragraph, I wish I had not wasted my money and passed it by. And I wish the PX had a better selection of books on Iraq."
3,Horrible Story - Not A Great Book,"I purchased this book because of the strong reviews. Perhaps the other reviewers have not read a lot of true crime, because there was nothing special about this. Basically, it was a newspaper article extended with a few more facts to make a book. The story is horrifying, but you never really learn much about the people."
4,Interesting true crime read,"This book was a fast read about a terrible crime. I truly feel for what the victim's mother had to go through. My only complaint is that there weren't more pictures but other than that, I would recommend this book to any true crime buffs."
4,"A compelling, well-drawn page-turner","Way above average true crime (though it falls short of the 'In Cold Blood'/'Executioner's Song'/'Our Guys' top ranks). A very good read nevertheless & it gets better as it goes along, peaking at the end (which isn't as obvious a point as it might seem--too few books in this genre deliver consistency & a sense of building to a climax). The opening & closing scenes (DON'T read ahead) are an excellent touch & all that the authors lay out in the book justifies the closing scene--they prove their speculation is worth listening to (& it's very convincing, actually). Even the obligatory trial scene is very well done. High points of the book are the portrait of Ken Register, who becomes convincingly darker as the book progresses, and the community & just the right amount of commentary on the broad type of person Ken Register represents without overdoing it. Definitely worth buying & reading."
2,Buyers beware.,"While this charger may at first appear to be good, reliable and even portable. I have had problems with it. The first one I got, I plugged it into a wall outlet, and it fried the unit, luckily the battery remained unharmed. Was able to get a replacement just fine and it works too.Here is the part I've had problems with, I've charged my psp batteries with this thing --several-- times, and eventually I begin to develop problems with the batteries, for instance, the batteries will no longer properly charge with the unit, or with the official Sony PSP battery charger. Fortunately though I was able to recover my 2200mAh battery by Sony by wiggling the battery and charger around enough, it takes time but if you're patient you might be able to get it to work again. And also lately, I've had my original psp battery go bad from using this charger too."
5,Afrobeat is Only the Beginning,"Calling this album afrobeat is a bit of a disservice. While that is one of its undeniable roots and what brought me to buy the album, as other reviewers have pointed out it has none of the pitfalls of the genre. The songs are not all interchangeable or unbearably long. A few of them are even beautiful. All of them, however, are fantastic.And yes, it's jazzy, it's funky, and some times it even rocks. Nu Tones shows NOMO's remarkable diversity, track to track.Add to that consistency. There's no filler here, just a fantastic album from opening notes to epic finale."
5,Six Stars out of Five!,"Seriously, this manages to be cute and powerful at the same time. It's a story of love which is willing to risk everything, even life itself for the loved one. It's a cute and funny romance story about a foxgirl who is addicted to meat. And somehow, it manages to weave these two together seamlessly, so it works. Everything, from Gu Mi-Ho's learning about human drinks like soda, from her learning about things like the fact that the other guy's blood is killing her, just sorta fits and molds together a wonderful story."
4,Excellent Drama,"Good Drama worth the watchthe subtitiles are good, but I have started to notice a few errors here and there but they do not make it hard to understand the dramamost of the subtitles are good though"
5,fun! A great thinking game!,"I learned how to play Octiles at Mensa's last Annual Gathering. I then stayed up until 3 am for the next few nights in the game room so I could play it. The rules are pretty easy. The strategy is more involved but not where-do-I start confusing. This is a great game for teens and adults. The set is made of wood, so it will last."
5,"Practical, common sense approach","This is one of the most useful books I have ever 'used'. It is not simply a book one reads, its a doing book. Especially useful is the simple explanation of Carl Jung's theory of projection. I first studied this book during a Conflict Resolution Training course well over a decade ago yet, the information is equally, if not more, relevant today as it was then. Highly recommend this book."
2,Sticks Well but Took the Paint Off the Wall,"3M Command Poster Strips did not live up to the quality of most other 3M products. The poster strips are easy to use, even without reading the instructions. However, I did read the instructions and found them easy to understand. The pictures are very helpful.I put my poster strips on the back of my poster and stuck the poster to a painted wall. I then pulled back one corner of the poster in order to straighten it out. A huge piece of paint came off my wall. I ended up just putting the poster back on the wall since it wasn't too crooked and looked better than the blemish that I had just created.The poster strips do a good job sticking something to the wall. However, I would recommend testing the strips on a small portion of your wall to make sure it does not remove your paint before using the product."
1,Tore the paint off the wall,"I WOULD NOT recommend this product. While the 3M Command Poster Strips did hold my poster nicely on the wall for over a year, when I went to remove it, it tore huge strips of paint off the wall on all 4 corners. It was so bad I had to repaint the entire wall. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Mostly great...,"These are great for hanging up posters or pictures or other lightweight things. The only problem I've run into is when it comes time to remove them. Occasionally they break apart and it becomes difficult, if not impossible to remove them cleanly."
2,Sticks but will damage posters,"These kept my posters up for an entire college year. Now that it has finally come down to removing the posters from my dorm walls I see how much of a lie this product actually is. No damage to posters? How about impossible not to damage posters. Every single poster I have taken down has had some of its back removed or if they were thing magazine posters had at least one corner horribly torn no matter how careful I was to try and remove these tabs. So these are good for posters you don't really care about or for more permanent hanging. Oh and if you're more concerned with your wall like other reviewers, don't worry my dorm walls weren't damaged in any way."
2,Took the paint off the wall,"Well, in general I have liked 3M's Commander series of products. I use them on the backs of many household doors to provide a hook for jackets, robes, etc. So I was happy to try the Poster Strips.I can't say I am impressed with this product. I used this product to mount a monthly calendar to my office wall. After about 6 months, I went to change the calendar.3 of 4 strips removed the paint from the wall.Their product advertising states, ""the mounting solution that holds on strongly, comes off cleanly! 3M's patented stretch release technology offers strong holding power and damage-free removal. The innovation - forget about nails, screws, tacks or messy adhesives that damage your walls. Revolutionary Command Adhesive works great on painted surfaces, wood, tile and more. Comes off cleanly leaving no holes, marks, sticky residue or stains.""I supposed that's partly true, it did not leave residue. It also did not leave the paint on the wall.Sorry, this one is a FAIL."
1,Will now have to pay for the wall damage in my dorms...,"Everything that I have hung with these strips have pull the wall paint off with it in my dorms, which means I will have to pay for every place I put them. They did not work for me and I followed the instructions exactly on the box."
2,Ehh..,There alright I have some brick walls in my room and they wouldn't stick there pretty crappy I would recommend getting something different because theses couldn't hold up really anything besides one poster and I found myself frequently using tons of them because they would simply not stick .
3,Works for small pictures,I have been using these for some very small pictures with a small frame and they are working well. I have had them up for 3 months now. I am getting ready to move and I have been taking down the pictures and the walls have no damage. I would recommend for something with very little weight. I have not tested these with anything very large and I probably would not since I am not sure they would work on something larger.
2,Not very effective,"I got 2 packs of these for my dorm room because I heard that they were the most likely thing to stick, and I had a lot of photos and posters to hang. They were kind of expensive for just adhesive strips, but I figured it would be worth it not to have to deal with my posters falling down on me two days after they were put up. I'm sure that these strips would work well for some surfaces, especially smoother surfaces, but they definitely do not want to stick to the plaster on the walls of my dorm. I think the maximum length that anything I put on my walls using these was about 2 days. If you're thinking of using these, make sure to test one or two on the wall where you plan to use them before you buy more."
2,Waste of Money,"I'm highly disappointed in this product. I have used other command products before with out issue. I bought this in September and have tried it twice, following the instructions exactly. The first time the picture fell. It didn't even last 30 secs on the wall. The second time I doubled the number of strips. This time the picture stayed up for less than 5 mins."
5,"mother, friend, brother, and a hell 'ov alot of firepower","This is probably the best bolo book, why? Supose you had a friend or mother who could recite poetry, play wargames, explore the meanings of the univers and kick out megatons of damage!! that is a bolo and in this book you will see that even a ""dead"" bolo can figure out a way to get the job done. An interesting point in this book is that in all but one of the stories the bolo is either massively damaged or modified to the point of being considered combat ineffective and not all stories are happy. the technical readout in the back is a great bonus. A must for any bolo fan, and anyone who believes in the power of the heart be it a Bolo, a human, or a dog gone pup."
5,Short & Spoiler Free Review,"The language is thick, the story structure is thin, but pound for pound, Pressfield's Fire is the standard by which all other historical fiction is measured. A Must Buy Manbook."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,I have read alot of this book and find it excellent.The battle at the gates is vivid and told to make you feel like you are there with the 300 spartans.It is a real page turner and I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the battle and how it was fought.
4,Book: Gates Of Fire; Thermopylae,"This book was purchased after seeing the movie 'The 300'. It offers a wealth of detail, which no movie can incorporate, on ancient Greek history, culture and attitudes. In the tradition of Mary Renault, this book makes ancient Greek history accessible by means of well researched novelization."
1,A Sad Day For World Literature,"dear friends:we Stand Here Today, Viewing The Corpse.........................Of Literature. All the Writers, Great, and Not So,..............Grieve Here Today...............................................Steven Pressfield, a hack, has sought, to defame, ..............not only History, but the Fine writerly Art.....................Mr. Pressfield is a Stupid Oaf..................................His Work, Gates Of Fire, Exceeds all previously.................established parameters of Stupid, Mindnumbing, Juvenile,........Hackneyed, Soul-destroying art..................................Homer's Ilyiad and Ullyses are violent, and yet speak to........to the kind soul of this, my sorrowful human race..............."
2,Fiction all the way,The author uses fictionalized life experiences of a couple of characters to present the action of a great Grecian war. It doesn't work.
1,Apalling,"What really, really scares me is that this piece of reactionary pseudo-history is highly rated among U.S. Army people. One would like to think that people who have the duty and privilege to defend democracy should be able to spot protofascims at its worst when it smacks them in the face. Not to mention the worst prose I've been exposed to in a long time. One of the worst books I've seen in my life if not the worst, and believe me, I've read some stinkers."
2,"Great premise, but too long, too many characters","Have no doubt about it, Presser is a talented storyteller, but there are just so many characters that any reader can keep track of, and feel empathy with, in a single novel. I was trudging through at the end, sort of like a Spartan grinding my sheild against the pages before me, a reference you'll understand if you read this book."
2,A disappointment,"This book disappointed me. It is not written with the same quality as recent historical fiction like Cold Mountain, The Year of Jubilo, Gone for Soldiers, etc. Not to be recommended."
5,Very Nice,"I haven't read hundreds of books (I'm only twenty one) but for what it's worth this is without a doubt my favorite one. I was enveloped right from the start, which is important to me. I have always loved history and Pressfield teaches much while still keeping an exciting story. Often my biggest complaint with books is that the author is too descriptive; not so here. I like how Pressfield describes the characters in terms of demeanor and status and personality rather than creating an image of everyone's nose. Anywho, i love this book and bought another pressfield (Killing Rommel) because of it."
3,Five stars it is not!,"I am suprise at how many readers give this work five stars. The story is good, but a bit to simply to be considered a core book worthy of five points. The character development, and story plot for them, is banal and seems to set on easy and simple principles of human morality without much inner conflict. The story creates a simple bifurcation of reality against good and evil, us and them, and heroes and villians. Besides these faults, the editing is terrible and the hisorical context of language is an anachromism that does injust to those who lived, thought and spoke in anceint greece. Did they really use that exact profanity? Being a student of the classics I found the historical accuracy to be lacking and the greek language in somewhat of misuse."
4,"History, Geography, Vocabulary with a high body count.","I got the title of this book from reading Lone Survivor. One of the Navy SEALS carried it with him. This is a similar story in that it is filled with bloody depictions of preparing for war and of fighting a losing cause. I read this book using an Atlas to find the places he was talking about. (Does anybody else do this?) You can learn a lot of geography that way. It brought back memories of a previous trip to Greece. The narrator is the lone survivor of the Battle of Thermoplae in 804 B.C. He is telling the tale to Xerxes, the king of Persia. Well-written and captivating reading."
5,"Spectacular!! History, Drama, and the Heart of Courage.","A Wonderful Novel!!!! If you have an interest in history, Sparta, psychology, or just the love of a good story based in FACT... this is a must read."
5,A wonderful read,"Makes me wish I had a delete button for my (brain) memory so I could enjoy it all over again. Mr Pressfield has brought Sparta back to life, and as for myself, I will never hear the adjective ""spartan"" in the same context again. Who owns the movie rights?"
3,Gates of Fire Review,"I am in the 9th grade. I had to read this book for World Studies I Honors. I thought that this book was confussing at times. I think that 9th graders should not have to read this book, because the vocabulary was very hard. They used words that I did not understand what they ment. Some of the book was very interesting though. I learned alot about Greek culture and history.The war parts were too detailed. This was good because you got to understand what was going on better, but it was bad because it was very very gross. They were very brutial people in war and life.I think that the best part of the book was when they were walking to the other city, and they saw all the bodies. They buired the dead baby. I thought this was really sad, but memorable."
4,An Engrossing and Deeply Moving Book,"Maybe the best book I've read since Cold Mountain. It is a thoroughly engrossing story, based on the battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartan soldiers, along with other Greek allies, held off an overwhelming force of invading Persians for several days. The narrator of the book is Xeno, a battle squier who is the sole survivor of the Spartan force. Pressfield convincingly sheds light on the nature of friendship, bravery, fear, freedom, honor, the differences between the sexes, and above all, love- love of country (and one's city) and the brotherly/fatherly love between the Spartans. The first few pages, explaining how Xeno comes to be brough before the Persian king Xerxes, to whom he relates his story, may seem boring or more likely confusing to some, but persevere and you will be richly rewarded."
4,Yeah right. More like ACID LOOPS for ACID SOFTWARE,"I have this disc, and it was funny how sounds used in these tracks are the same as samples I've used in creating songs with ACID a music production and remixing program, sure they are royalty free, but i'll note that there in no actual copyright any where on the disc or packaging. The songs are good, but from actual 70s porn, I think not. The packaging it 1000% awesome too.If anyone wants mine though, I'll sell it for $300. hahaha. ;)"
2,Not on Par,"outside of ""Who in the Funk do you think you are""?&Parts of ""Sylvester"" is this worth listening to.this is one of the Records by a Artist that you hope in many ways is Bootlegged&never put out fully because it doesn't even begin to Capture the Greatness that this Artist once displayed so well.this Album is like a Boxing Match when a Guy has been knocked down two times&He is getting ready to take another fall&then you have to throw in the White Towel well this is the Scene with this Album.SLy Stone Sadly here was doing a 3rd-Tier Version of Himself Here."
2,ONE FOR COLLECTORS,"This album came out as the eighties were dawning, and as such, is past sly's peak of creativity. But considering it came out in a time of awful mechanical production values, it sounds pretty good! This is not sly's worst album either it just lacks the musical brilliance that his early band(Larry Graham et al) afforded him.Sly wrestles too hard with the discoish sound of L.O.V.I.N.U. and Who in the funk do we think we are? and comes off sounding slightly wooden, the latter is still a good tune though. It will certainly dissapoint slightly unless youre a die hard fan.But that being said dont be too put off as it's cheap, has an interesting lyric book and is better than buying some of the dodgy compilations of very early material.In a nutshell a better late period sly album, just not as gritty as the stuff i love. Try graham central station and betty davis if you want more sly like music."
4,the understudy,a great lighthearted read. lots of laughing out loud. very easy to pick up as I was wondering what the characters were up to. ideal for the beach.
2,Ansiedad by Chelique Sarabia,"I'm familiar with the music of this composer from Venezuela but was disappointed with the material on this CD.The recording may be old and the songs are not his best, or maybe it was the arrangements....overall, I did not like it."
3,Solid Thought But Mistakes Of Correlation Throughout,"The book is a truly excellent for showing how the sacred word is applied, but the color and element correlations are all mixed up: In one part of the book one element and/or color is connected with a letter...then there is another color or element shown in another part of the book for the same letter. You would never find this out unless you seriously studied the book. I don't know if the printer made the mistakes, or if Franz Bardon made the errors due to the stress of the situations he was under while writing the book. Still, even with these errors, the book is worth the price. Franz Bardon was (is) a true initiate, and worthy of all respect, and praise for what he has given to humanity through his writings!"
5,Super Item,The table came in a tight package. The Bistro Table is very classy and sturdy. It is a nice addition to the patio.
5,Great Book,"What a great story. We read it to our 6, 4, and 2 year olds. They loved it just as much as we did. The author did a wonderful job of weaving Christ into an intriguing story."
2,Towel Warmer - Not,"The towel warmer looks very nice. However, it only warms the towel where the towel touches a rail, and only on 1 side. If hanging more than 1 towel, the one on top does not warm. It also dries the towels out so they are scratchy when used. Towels sometimes smell slightly scorched, as if they were taken out of a high heat dryer."
4,Game,"If you like need for speed games, you will like this. Fun to play when there is nothing else to do. A little different than the PS3 games, but same concept."
2,Not worth the frustration,"This game had allot of potentional to be great, sadly the morons who programmed the game ruined it with the AI for the cops and other drivers. The graphics are great for a handheld game and the music selection was decent. You can modify the cars with performance enhancements and visual upgrades. The racing was allot of fun and even intense at times....up until the cops gave chase and thats where the game is ruined. The AI cops go after you almost exclusivly. No matter how fast you are, the cops will catch you in a matter of seconds even if they start off half a lap behind you and there is no getting away from them. Once they are close they begin to hammer into your car while the other racers drive by untouched. In the end it ruins the fun and just leaves you completely frustrated. The best thing to do is save your money for a better game but if you really feel the need to get it then go to a gamestore and buy it off the used shelf....that's where my copy will be."
2,Good game if it would load correctly.,"I can't believe that this game made it out of EA without being checked by their QA department. Saying it has issues is an understatement.I would really enjoy this game if it didn't constantly lock up or get stuck during loading. None of my other games have problems like this. Yes, some of it is very repetitive but I do enjoy most of the races. I also like the cars and the soundtrack. But it's just too annoying to turn my machine on and off again just to get the game to work. It's too bad because I really want to rate this game higher."
4,ITS VERY FUN.....,when i first got my psp i got this game with it. It was very fun until the third person on the blacklist[list of bosses]i got stuck. the graphics are very good .though some times when you press select[on psp]your car flashes. and it looks weird. on the psp it doesn't tell u the storyline. on the other consoles it give a video clip. the controls are easy and if u don't likeit u can change it.there are a variety of tracks. you can customize your car any way u want. u can also race online. it is kinda laggy online.it is very fun and if ur looking for a great racing game and don't really care ALOT ALOT about graphics.id say 7 out of ten.
5,Soo Loving It!,"GRITS did it again! This album is so tight, ya need to get it. Just bought it few days after the release, and soo enjoying it. I thank God for them."
4,Last minute delivery,"Came the very last day. May have been mailman's issue but still could have been sent out earlier. No biggie, product was good."
3,"Reasonable quality for the price, but fails to impress","Have you ever picked up a man's watch and been surprised by its weight, and wondered how they got used to lugging it around?That will never be an issue with this watch.It weighs basically nothing. The case and crystal are reasonable, and the display back is a nice touch. The band, however, feels extremely flimsy and I hope will outlast its first impression. The watch wears smaller than its 38mm would indicate, so if you enjoy a smaller watch, this fits the bill. It looks quite nice, but the illusion dissipates quickly when you pick it up."
3,MORE FOR A SCHOLAR THAN AN ART APPRECIATOR,"Although truthfully described as 148 pages, this edition offers only about 40 prints. Over a third of them are left and right triptych sections, set two on a page. The matte or semi-gloss coating of the pages offer muted renditions of Bosch's work; there's a dimness felt, partly by the artist's bleak design, perhaps more-so by the printing process.To the book's credit, the writing regarding the artist, his milleu and the art's analysis/context was direct, seemingly thorough and informative. So this book, the least expensive around, is well-worth the discount price. If you're looking for a more dramatic coffee-table book, look elsewhere. Most people are interested the Bosch for his weird little people. Or his Garden of Earthly Delights. But if you've got more scholarly needs, this book'll do just fine."
5,Fantastic classic,I've loved this book since I was 4. It never gets old. They don't write books like this anymore. It's a definitely worth reading.
3,A Disappointment ...and so sorry to say it,"This was such a disappointment. I had looked forward to this for months, having admired Mac Wiseman for over fifty years, and Prine for thirty or so. But this just doesn't work.The songs are such classics that each singer could do them well while singing by himslef. But there are just no strong emotional tugs from these ""collaborations."" Mac has done some great work singing with other bluegrass singers, and Prine has been terrific in his work with women singers ... but these two great men never seem to feed off one another. The feel suggests that these guys were not even singing together. I'll lay this away and go back to the many songs that I have by each that are so terrific."
2,Not what I wanted,This game wasn't as good as I was hoping for but I'm ok with it seeing as I didn't spend that much money on it. So all and all I was happy that I got it.
1,not a good game,"my son got angry at the game 1 to many times and broke the game (and gameboy) because he couldent get to level 3. it was horible, it not only made my son angry beond belief, it cost me good money too. thanks need for speed."
1,Rocky...not such a good fighter,This bag was broken within one day. The kids played with it (not roughly) and it was broken - the water leaked and went throughout the bag so it wouldn't stand back up.....very poor!
5,20 th Century European History,"Alan Bullock is clearly a scholar of the highest order. What is more, for a layman such as I am, his writing is superbly easy to read and always interesting for every page of an almost 900 page book. The book is strongly recommended for those with a liking for recent history."
3,Mister Dog Puffs Along,"One of the biggest differences between children's books of today and those from a half century before is the presence of pipes. In the 1940s, shorthand for ""father"" was ""the fellow smoking a pipe."" Today that distinction is woefully absent. Mister Dog, while not a father himself, does take a paternal role with a wayward boy, in some way justifying the fact that on nearly every page his smoldering corn cob juts jauntily from his furry lips. True, in one frame a bunny has taken over the duties of smoking, but this is just in good fun. The true strength of the book is its illustrations. Garth Williams, illustrator of so many stories, is splendid. His cats, those Mr. Dog frolics with while on a walk, made my daughter laugh aloud. The story itself, frankly, is pretty dippy. Dated and occasionally odd, the pictures invite parents to come up with a narrative of their own."
3,A Victim of Hatred,"I can't speak to the prejudice of the Americans since I was a little girl in an internment camp under the Japanese during WWII.The disdain for us ""white, non asian"" people was so obvious, you could taste it. I was only a little girl but I knew the Japanese didn't think much of us. They treated us as second class citizens who should be ashamed to be alive. They did every thing they could to hurt and mistreat us, including beatings beyond belief. Do I believe there was prejudice???? Yes, ofcourse! We hated the ""Japs"" as much as they hated us. Love and hate go both ways."
3,Doesn't Do Wilde Justice,"While Wilde was one of the greatest wits of our time, this book of epigrams is sorely lacking. His bits of conversation are fun to read, but quotations from his written works are taken out of context and lose much because of that. I recommend this for any Wildephile, but with reservations."
4,Really great for the money!,"The Logitech Bluetooth headset that I had been using for 2 years broke and while waiting for the replacement part from Logitech I ordered this inexpensive Motorola for the meantime.In my opinion it sounds much better then the Logitech, my callers said it sounds MUCH better on the other end, and it's smaller, lighter, and easier to put on/off.It was also half the price of the Logitech. I can't imagine that the customer support is even close. Logitech has been by far the best company that I've had dealings with, but its just over $20! Great, and even better for the price!"
1,"Abandon Hope, all ye who enter here...",This item was dead on arrival. Process for returning felt like too much rigmarole. So guess who won't be buying another one of these?!
5,Excellent,"I have waited since 1972 to see this series again and it brought back a flood of memories. Superb show, great transfer, charming as I remembered it. Thank you A & E video!"
2,"Should Be Renamed, ""... of America's Successful Male Politicians ...""","If you are a young person looking for any female role models, look elsewhere. I was disappointed not only with this gender oversight, but also that the author focuses on men in office (plus a few entertainers, athletes, and coaches). Where are the artists, physicians, and Nobel Laureates? America certainly has its share, but these successful people are not represented here."
4,Claw Vending Machine-toy,"The kids who love the ""claw"" or ""crane"" arcade machines will love this. It took a lot of use and abuse and still worked. Two things held me back from giving it 5 stars: 1. the music on the machine had no volume control - at first it was fun and novel, but don't even attempt to carry on a conversation next to the machine. 2. It is now less than a month after Christmas (when it was given) and it's broken - I do have to give it credit though - it was used for hours daily up until it broke. Two children between the ages of 3 and 7 used it pretty roughly.The hours of fun the kids had while it was working made it worth the $20-25-ish I paid. It made the kids work on patience, taking turns, concentration, perserverence and using fine motor skills/coordination."
2,Frustrating!,"Like the review by ""Three Sisters"", we have tried different candies with little luck. I was able to FINALLY pick up a tootsie roll and a dum-dum lollipop, but no luck all the other times. My 6yo son has had ZERO success, which is hard to witness as he was SO excited when he got this for his birthday. If my kids eat their dinner all gone, they can have a candy treat -- so I thought this would add an extra element of fun for them to use the skill crane. Yeah, right! Also, I bought mine at Bed, Bath and Beyond in 12/07 for $19.99 minus a 20% coupon."
3,shazam,still cant believe how jim nabors can sing im still used to him being the goofy mechanic on the andy griffin show not 1 of his better cds tho
2,Fairie-Ality: The Fashion Collection,"The book has wonderful pictures, but other than sitting on a coffee table there isn't much use for it. I was expecting methods and instructions or at least where to purchase items to design. I was very dissapointed."
1,Don't buy this. Buy the whole albums.,"I hate to give a King album 1 star; I'm listening to Conspiracy right now. The thing is, the King records are album-based and very rarely do the songs have anywhere near their maximum impact in isolation. Furthermore, there are some wonderful albums not represented here, and King's worst album (Spider's Lullaby) has some tracks. This isn't really a King album, just a compilation put together by one of the labels that carried his stuff for a few years.Wanna rock out to some King? Start with Puppet Master--diehards don't always like it as much as the stuff from the 80s, but it's the most approachable King. Follow on with reading the Abigail lyrics and then listening to Abigail 2, or reading the Them lyrics and listening to Conspiracy."
4,Pretty good,"I like Pike, but prefer Elvis as the protagonist. But all in all, this was an enjoyable read."
5,Just finished,I totally have enjoyed the Elvis Cole novels and now with Joe Pike added they just get better and better.
2,Quality writing with a weak story,"The attraction to me of Crais' work is that he writes so well, and he carries that through at least in part, in The Watchman. However, this ""Joe Pike"" novel isn't told exclusively from Pike's point of view. There are several other characters who contribute to the story, filling-in what Joe Pike doesn't know at any given time. This is weak storytelling, and this comes through when Crais ""tells"", rather than ""shows"".The result is a weak read, far from the best (or even the usual) quality that Crais puts out. The story also lacks pace after the opening chapters, and this despite it being rather short. I won't spoil the read by revealing the plot, but suffice to say, the ultimate bad guy in the story is somewhat obvious early on and it is something of a cliche.It greives me to write this review, as I am a fan of Crais' work and have read most, if not all that he has done.I look forward to a return to form in future works."
5,Tina M,"Love Robert Crais and love, love, love, Joe Pike! I really enjoyed reading this book, but then I love all of Mr. Crais' books and characters and I am always looking forward to the next one. I of course love Elvis and he does make quite a few appearances in this book, but it is mainly about Joe, who is such a mysterious character that you just want to learn more and more about him. I hope Mr. Crais writes more Joe Pike novels, I really thought it was a good story."
4,The Joe and Elvis Show,Starts a little slow but soon the action picks up. Roles somewhat reversed as Elvis is in the background and Joe steps up.Another good outing for Robert Crais.
4,Nice Read,"This is the first book I read from Robert Crais and I was quit satisfied. This book kept me on edge and I had trouble putting it down. Pike is a bad mother, shut your mouth! Nice story line with a interesting twist.I will probably read more of his books. Two thumbs up!"
5,"A small, obscure literary masterpiece.","This book was a delight to read. It takes one back in time to meet a man, who like the rest of us, struggled with his faith, doubted, feared, was angry and yet never let go of his belief in his God. The pages provoke thoughtful meditations that let the reader read at an almost meditative pace. I read one or two pages and I'd have something of substance to ponder for the day. Sometimes I felt so close to the subject. Frost is quite a literary engineer to have mastered this concept and place the reader in the room with ""friends"" like those of Job. Those full of pat answers, advice, judgements, etc. Only to find that Job was the one to end up counseling them. I certainly will have this one in my library within easy reach. Excellent for those who have questions that don't require tidy answers, just a true faith. After reading this, one will find that it really isn't the answers we crave as much as the One who is the Answer."
2,Fantasy Novel...,"The book is said to be an autobiography of Franz Bardon, but I believe it was actually one of those close to him who actually wrote the book.The author states that Bardon passed on facts to his secretary that were was used as a framework for the novel. I'm not too positive the material presented is entirely accurate, as it wasn't Bardon who wrote it and the information given from Franz Bardon was modified for printing.The book is more like a fantasy novel of occultism than anything else, and I do not think those looking for a serious read on occultism would be interested in this book."
5,Toy collector,"This racetrack is great. My 23mo old son loves to shake the cars and watch them crash. I bought it on clearance for $30 and also purchased 4 additional crash up cars for $6 each it is well worth it and with all the fun my son is having I would not have mind paying full price. The track was easy for me to put together and we move it from room to room with maybe only 2 or 3 pieces that fall off, but it snaps back together. If you put the track together exactly as the instructions say, there will not be any prblems.I have read many complaints that the cars don't run long enough and you have to keep shaking them. That's the point of shake n go. Who can shake the car the hardest and longest to get it to run the furthest? I think it displays a great sense of cause and effect, plus its just a toy. ( Try the planes they are great too!!! Must follow instructions for palnes to work properly.)"
2,fun but needs improvement,my son loves this toy but we spend half our time putting it back together. It's hard to line the tracks up and the slightest movement disassembles the track.
5,Clutch adjuster.,This tool is as I expected easy to use make adjusting clutchs quick. I use this tool on a daily basis for I am a diesel tech. I got this cheaper then on other places like the big tool company's. They don't have the bolt that comes with it this one does. It was worth buying. Made strong. Plus its an OTC cheaper then other places are asking.
4,"Addicting, very enjoyable!","I am a huge fan of Barbara Michaels books, including those under her real name, Elizabeth Peters. I really loved this book. Search the Shadows features Haskell, a young woman on a journey to find out who her real father is, as well as learn more about her deceased mother. As always, the main character is surrounded by quirky yet endearing characters. Suspense and danger threaten Haskell throughout the novel. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,Just okay,"The true fact is that you don't need most of the stuff. A good diaper table, a good stroller, a good car seat - that is about it. Bottle warmers, diaper genies, the plethora of baby toys - really are not necessary and end up in a yard sale or donated anyway."
1,Use your money on an on-line subscription to Consumer Report,"Don't buy the book. Instead, get a membership to Consumer Reports web site for the latest info and reviews.I am a big fan of CR, but information changes, they re-evaluate products and recalls happen. It is easier to stay up-to-the minute with the CR web site. The book doesn't contain any info that is not on the web site and the latest info isn't in the book. Plus, with the online membership, you can access all their info, not just baby products.In terms of a book, get Baby Bargains by Denise & Alan Fields. Between CR and Baby Bargains - that is all you will need!"
1,BUY BABY BARGAINS INSTEAD!,"I ordered this book, glanced through it, and immediately returned it. I thought it would have ratings of specific brands, which it did -- but only of cameras & video cameras. On baby foods, it said, ""ask your pediatrician."" It gave tips on what to look for on things like swings, car seats, and strollers, but didn't name good/better/best brands & models.I had already checked out Baby Bargains from the library, and had hoped that this book would be a nice supplement. Don't buy the Consumer Reports book! Baby Bargains has specific brand name recommendations, and was extremely helpful with everything. If you're looking for info. on what to buy for your baby, go with Baby Bargains. I can't say enough how uninformative I found this book. Save your money -- or better yet, buy Baby Bargains instead!"
1,Worthless - Get Baby Bargains Instead,"I purchased this book to augment Baby Bargains - what a waste.When the majority of the information is not in the handy ratings methodology their magazine uses - What's the point??It appears that they cobbled together a list of products and put in the manufacturers' descriptions in paragraph form along with the statement that they didn't review items in this category.I was deceived by the publisher - this was not a report by consumers or even their own people - this was just an advertisement for a bunch of baby products that was SOLD to me based on their ""trusted"" name.The truly disgusting part is that I paid them for this and they probably made money on the back-end from the manufacturers by charging them to be included in the book.Not only should you save your money, but you should question the impartiality of Consumer Reports."
3,different,"different way to tackle a basketball movie, interesting and touching but overall an average movie."
1,Feel free to throw away your money,Slapping on terms like Ultra and gold plated will bring in the suckers every time. Digital is digital. There are cables on Amazon and elsewhere that are less than a third the cost that do an equally fine job. I have bought monster HDMI cables in the past and compared it against no name brands and there is no difference in audio or video.
1,The wonders of marketing...,Seriously people...I guess the same people who feel that a digital signal runs better through these are the same people who believe putting a turbo sticker on a car will make it go faster. All the people driving a Hummer raise your hands!
1,the bread for life diet,I thought this was just the same old diet info. with the addition of 'light bread'Think that just eating healthily and doing exercise would have the same effect!!I'm glad I bought this at a bargain price. In fact I'm sorry I bought it!
5,Nice stools...,"Very nice design, finish and quality. Very sturdy. Happy with my purchase! Look great as an accent to a kitchen with stainless steel appliances."
5,beautiful ring!!!,"this is a very beautiful ring. i bough this ring as a promise ring. i wanted to give it to me girlfriend on feb. 14 valentines day, but the the ring arrived late :/ i paid for expedited shipping but didnt arrive on time. the seller was more than happy to refund me for the shipping. i decided to return the ring and repurchase it later in the future because i might use it as a proposal ring when my 3 year anniversary with my girlfriend comes up. i would highly recommend this ring. very beautiful and very worth the time."
4,Good book,This book is a good way to see how children view the world around them and it provides insight for teachers and parents alike.
5,"great, little known AOR paradise","Why, oh, why wasn't this a massive hit in the day? It's got all the right ingredients. Crunchy guitars, poppy synths, soaring melodies, big choruses and a singer who was so good, that he was nabbed by Toto.Highights include the very catchy Carrie's gone and the great, should've been a huge hit, Back in America.If you love good solid eighties AOR, then chances are that you will love this CD."
3,Does this product contain optical brighteners?,"Does this product contain optical brighteners? I've been trying for months to find out from Engleside Products, but they refuse to answer my emails, making me very suspicious."
4,great,"Great fun to read. I highly recommend if you're thinking about goin there, or even traveling in general. It's puts you right in the mind of the adventurer, and more than anything, lets you realize the world around you."
5,Trackers tales- Thailand true stories,"Promptly received verification of order, date shipped and approx arrival dates. Since I live in Hawaii the arrival dates were off. When I contacted the seller I was assured it would still arrive and seller was kind and gave excellent customer service. The book arrived in beautiful condition no one at the party believed it was a used book. :-)Im very happy with this seller and highly recommend them. Honest and reliable.Mahalo"
4,Evil comes with strings attached,"Pretty creepy. Brittany Alyse Smith did an excellent job of playing the little girl Zoe. She is kind of a cross between Shirley Temple and Audery Rose. I'm still trying to figure out ""who-done-it"", logically it doesn't make sense.... or does it?The review above here that demands more blood and killing.... well if that is what you watch the movie for, you'll be disappointed. The nightly news is bloodier... but if you like an eight year old female Freddy Kruger OR was it wooden puppet Chuckie AKA Pinocchio... its fine."
1,Horrible!,"Very bad. The narrative unbelievably horrid! The narrator is a teen who sounds like she is giving a high school report in front of her teacher. She reads from a report that sounds like she wrote it herself and pronounces every syllable of english like this: wa-ter, eng-lish, etc. The sights are shown for all of 2 or 3 seconds before they move on to the next shot of a historic landmark or shot of the city. The tape itself is only 23 minutes long. In between shots, they show teens on a stage blowing a kiss. Very bad, I would never expect to buy something of this horrible quality. I do not recommend this video.(If this was meant for high-school use, they certainly should have said so in the item description. From that description, I was left with the impression that it was a travel video.)"
4,Overall a Great Mount and Inexpensive,Bracket is well built and is a snap to install. Using the leveling bracket (make sure it's level) to mount to wall and mounting bracket to the rear of the LCD TV makes it very easy to hang on the wall. All of the pivot arms work well.
1,Can't mount it square,"The mount looks like a quality mount and well outfitted with a bubble level and all hardware.I had to drill 3 times and then mount it off level to accommodate the 20 LDC TV's weight. Yet it still is not level, and cannot remain level when moved and swung.GO fixed and flush, or spend a lot more."
5,Excellent,"Easy to install, has a leveler right on it. Solid construction. Well worth the $27.00 I paid."
1,Does the job... barely,"I'm hanging a Niko 26"" lcd tv on this mount (31 lbs) and I must say I'm disappointed and would definitely not recommend this product for anything but the lightest of flat panels.Pros:Looks and feels like a solid piece of kit out of the boxVery easy to install - integral spirit level and the one click locking mechanism are excellent featuresCons:Too much ""play"" in the hinges - leaves the TV lop-sided if you swivel the monitor to the left or right. If you are not intending to swivel the tv to the left or right you could probably live with this.The tilt knob is the weakest link in this mount. Made of plastic, it's difficult to get it sufficiently tight to hold the tv at the desired angle while not overtightening (and breaking) the knob.My issues are not as a result of incorrect installation. It is easy to mount the bracket dead level with the aid of the inbuilt spirit level. If only the tv stayed that way once mounted!"
4,Easy mounting,"Much easier to mount TV than most mounts because you mount base bracket and slide TV mount with TV attached on the bracket. Most mounts require mounting entire mechanism - cumbersome. Some have complained of TV tilting after mounting and mine did also at first - until I tightened up the 2 swivel joints with the included allen wrench (less than a minute job). Once tightened, TV is perfectly level in any position.Also FYI - comes with hardware to mount a 100 x 200 mm vesa mount although not shown in pictures."
4,Beware if you're looking for the new edition,"I purchased this edition hoping that it had been updated since the 1995 edition. However, this is the same book as the 1995 edition, except it has a CD-ROM to accompany it. In my opinion, the only people who will find the CD-ROM useful are beginning students of molecular biology. The illustrations in the book are good to begin with which largely negate the need for this CD-ROM."
1,Do not purchase!,"I ordered this item and when received the item was damaged. Also, the color does not match the pictures. The seller is being very difficult in managing the return. I definitely recommend to avoid this product and this seller."
4,Great Stick,"I own this exact stick and it is not the most powerful stick I have used, but its powerful enough, the most powerful stick I have used was a Bill Mcdaniels cue stick. This cue hits pretty sweet and it will last a long time, as long as the shaft does not get to hot, like if you leave it in your car and it heats up, the heat can make the wood swell up and it can crack the plastic around the wood. Also you can make this stick any weight you like the best for your personal feel. The weights sometimes come loose and start to rattle as you shoot, but this is not a big problem at all, just carry around a Phillips screwdriver around with you, so you can tighten up the butt weights if they do come loose. I run the table no problem with this stick and it feels great as you stroke and its got enough power for good draw shots, but nothing ridiculous."
4,Too academic for the average reader,"I was a student of Prof Cameron at Old Dominion and it amazes me that people advocate book burning just because they disagree with his ideas. He was decried as a racist on campus and these fools denounce him for sitting in an ivory tower. This book is written as an academic work and should be treated as such. It has to be taken dispassionately, I'm a former Marine and not did not see anything revisionist in his work. If you are too afraid to hold a mirror to yourself don't read this book---stick to Clancy-he uses small word and easy sentences."
1,"Fortunately, a free society tolerates idiots.","The authors Cameron's craven attempt to attack the finest fighting force in history is nothing new. Such behavior is often found in those who shrink from duty, honor, country and allow their betters to suffer in their stead.The Camerons are not fit to utter the phrase, ""Marine Corps"", let alone offer an opinion of its war fighting preeminence... Tens of thousands of voices long dead shout them down."
3,Okay to watch,you can pick the winner before the season even begins. Just pick the person with the most hurdles to overcome or the prettiest girl in the lot and you got the winner
5,Fantastic Book,This book came highly recommended from my instructor. It will pay off. The only draw back is that this is for the SY-01 test when it will be outdated come July 31st.
3,"Trillium Worldwide TWI-7001, AutoVent Solar Powered Vent.","I have an auto that the interior would reach about 150 degrees during the heat of the summer in Oklahoma. This unit worked as advertised but moved very little air. The interior temperature did not cool much from this. As I determined, it was due to the fact that this auto has a glass roof and only a sliding screen to block the light. I imagine if the auto you have has a solid roof, and is a compact without dark tinting, this may help you a few degrees. I would not purchase another to replace this one."
2,Works poorly.,Does not work with tinted windows. The fan is sub par and does not have enough power to cool the car.
1,appreciate your honesty,"I thank goodness did not buy this product, but was very tempted. I want to thank all the honest people for their reviews.. It saved me money and time. Thank you"
2,Not Impressed,"Looks good on paper, but the units really don't work well. I purchased two, and the difference in the car's temperature not much. The fams turn only in the brightest of light when the car is oriented 90 degrees sideways to the sun, which is not always possible. The cases flex when the window closes so the fan won't turn, so fooling around with them to get them just right takes time, then water can leak in if you get a thunderstorm because the fit isn't tight."
1,Eddy Duchin CD,"I am looking for the Eddy Duchin Story Soundtrack. The movie came out in 1956 and the last soundtrack was in 1959, I believe. One of your reviews said it can be found in FNAC in Paris. Only problem with that website is it is in French. How can I switch to an English website?"
2,Don't be fooled!,"I have been waiting for 30 years for the sound track to ""The Eddie Duchin Story"" to be re-released (Capitol T-716) but was fooled by the title of this C.D. It's not that this C.D. is that bad as it does include a few of his songs that he was famous for,but the soundtrack to the original movie of the same name is a wonderful recording and should be made availabe again as so many soundtracks of old movies have. The recording quality is poor on this c.d. as they are original recordings (and this is to be expected). The original soundtrack to the movie would bring his music more to life. Does anyone know where I can find it or do I have to wait another 30 years!!"
2,WRONG ARTIST,"The original movie score was played by Carmen Cavallaro and it was simply great. I believe it was on Decca Records. Decca is now MCA, and I would like to know when is MCA going to place this rare gem of instrumental perfection on a CD. We have waited decades for it, and it is long overdue. Please issue on a CD so that past and current generations can enjoy.Reynold Decou"
1,Cycling - what through women,"After reading the first 56 pages of this book, I'm done.It has extremely little to do with Bicycling, rather it's more about an aimless man who is having sex with multiple women and the book is mostly about how he cycles through them. I think that's why the title ""cycling""If youre looking for a book about cycling try The Race. It's worth reading again and again"
5,The good one,"This is an excellent book for those starting to play guitar; easy to follow, good technique and a variety of themes."
5,Great Teaching Book,"This was a requirement for my private lessons.I bought it not thinking much of it... until we went through the lessons...The student teacher duets are my favorite.Even for personal use, it's great.I would highly recommend the purchase of this book!"
1,Pretty disappointed,Order 2 of these in April. I wash 2 Ford Explorers weekly. In the past Chamois I brought at Costco would last me at least 2 years. Costco no longer sell them and I ordered these off of Amazon and they have been falling apart from the 1st time I used them. They come with a huge staples in them that puts 2 holes in from the beginning. Would not buy again
5,big foot great,"A sincere and honest look at Big Foot. The reader is left with a well rounded understanding of the Foot, not the usual tabloid hype. Text is enhanced by evocative drawings of Big Foot. Warning -this book is not for the humor challenged."
4,If you want your friends to look at you funny...,"If you want your friends to look at you funny, buy this book and show it to them.I bought it based on the recommendation of some author on NPR, and I hunted it down, it's HILARIOUS! Warning though: not all your friends will get it. Too bad for them! THe drawings are quirky and funny, the text almost made me wet my pants.My only complaint is it's too short!If you like this, order ""A Really Super Book About Squirrels"", by the same illustrator. THe text isn't nearly as goofy, but the drawings are just great."
2,OK but just OK.,"I actually thought this was a book-book when I bought it, but it took 5 minutes to read, at the most, and that's probably the most disappointing thing I have to report. I didn't realize this is essentially an adult's comic book.As far as its level of hilariousness, meh. I thought it was cute and I chortled a bit. It's not pants-peeing funny by any means. It's more like when you find a funny birthday card at Hallmark and you laugh and say ""ha! that's cute.""Very disappointed that ten bucks has gone down the drain in such record time. I'll keep the book and put it out as decor in the guest room, but that's about the extent of it."
4,massive metal,This is overall a good collection from Living Sacrifice. Some of the older stuff on this greatest hits album is a little out dated but its nice to here where a bands' sound comes from in their begining stages.
5,Best Metal Ever! ...... For me...,"Lets get this out of the way first. They are christian. That doesn't however mean that they cannot be better then some other ""main stream"" artists. It just means that they are ""clean."" When I say clean I mean it in the sense that they don't curse to get their point made. They have a very brutal sound, almost an industrial feel to them. They scream a lot. If that isn't your cup of tea, then either don't bother, or try it out.In Memoriam specifically, this is basically their ""greatest hits"". They have some of my favorites one of them being, ""Bloodwork"". Try em' out metal lovers, you might just like them. p.s. they are not a speed metal band, more of heavy hammer ons."
5,An Excellent album worth having!,"Dave Loggins album ""Please come to Boston"" is one of the best recordings of all time. All of the songs in this album are excellent! Your friend Roberto C."
4,Great songs,"What else is there? The album brings a few of my favorite songs, especially ""Pieces of April""."
5,Anger management. grrrrr,Excellent lesson on anger management. Read this a long time ago. Now we have a copy for each of our four young adult children.
4,Space Opera in its Purest Form,"This novel is perhaps the purest example of the Space Opera genre in existence. The story moves at a breakneck pace with a ""Buck Rogers"" feel to it that is hard to describe. The clash of great star empires with their super-weapons, space fleets and space heroes all resound throughout this glittery story.This is an easy read for a ""beer and chips"" afternoon that lovers of space opera should not miss. Highly recommended."
1,DONT BUY THEM,"I used them once and threw them away.They suck! I was looking for goggles that blocked out the light and did not make me look like a racoon. When I was done tanning, my eyes hurt from squinting and of course I looked like a racoon. Please dont buy these things!"
3,"Where have you gone, Charlie Parker?","That Connolly is a gifted writer is no longer in question. He writes crime/detective novels with a Victorian flare rarely seen in modern fiction of any type. This book is no exception. Unfortunately in this book, he uses a few too many words for what is, in reality, a short story, at best. I will continue to read all of his novels just to admire his gift of quality prose. I hope that he backs up a little and allows Charlie to come back to Earth in his next tale."
3,"good, but overly long thriller","This is the first Connolly book that I've read, so I don't know what his normal writing style is. I found the plot line very interesting and the story was compelling. However, I found that this book was very verbose. There were many times where the author seemed to get sidetracked with too many details behind some bit of the storyline. Eventually, I found this very distracting and in reading these sidelines, I started losing the storyline and becoming bored. Yet, I was still interested in the main storyline. So finally, when I got to one of these sidetracks, I found myself just skipping over them to get back to the main storyline. I commend Connolly for attempting to interject some history and some story background, but I found there was just way too much of it in this book. That being said, it was a very good story and I did enjoy reading it."
5,Good one,"I found this pan leaks in water bath and thus hated it. Seems like I used it in a wrong way... Thanks s.m.m, this is a smart idea and I never thought about it. I'll try the aluminum foil idea next time. I also found it great for frozen cheesecakes as I could easily take the cake out without breaking it. I am now pretty happy with it."
4,A great account of a truly sadistic killer,"If you want to know anything about the Genesee River Killings then this is the book you are after, it goes into the detail you want and leaves out nothing. A great read and a good reference point for those studying the serial killer genre. Highly recommended."
4,"Good, but very thick...","very famous black book! This book is not very hard. TCP/IP overview, kerberos5, IIS, DHCP, DNS, WINS, RAS...etc.Special Thanks to nagie, cow, loger! I'm gettabeam!"
4,An Excellent Introduction To The French Revolution,"The Rights of Man, The Reign of Terror: The Story of the French Revolution, Susan Banfield; J.P. Lippincott (1989)Banfield's occasional grammatical, stylistic & chronological miscues pale in significance when compared to the overall value of what is an excellent introduction to this oft-appallingly violent historical era.And its bibliography (""Recommended for Further Study"") gave me the first heads-up as to the existence of historian J.C. Herold's ""The Mind of Napoleon.""What better reasons could exist for the birth of gratitude?"
3,not a bug's life,"The book was O.K. However, I'm not sure what the entymology of it is. I didn't see any references to bugs in it."
4,Very good traditional,If you enjoy traditional Chinese music this is a great cd. I use it for a background music while i am doing my kung fu meditation
5,cute and cuddly,"I bought this pheasant for my son, who is collecting all of the plush birds. The shipping was fast, when we opened the box, the pheasant looked exactly like the picture online. Material is durable, and while it cannot be washed because of the sound device inside the bird, dirt or stains can be rubbed off with a gentle cleaner and towel. Yes we already had to clean the bird."
5,"Excellent, stories make you think, great for all ages","I used this book at camp for devotions and to read to the kids as they fell asleep; however, I also gained a great deal from the parables as well. The material in the book is very relevent to several different challenges facing the church, is Biblically based, and entertaining."
1,really disappointing,I was hoping for a good read with this one but found it terrible. The author had too many opinions to push. The book became too much like a tawdry romance novel.
3,"So Good, So,So","I just finished reading the book and it was an entertaining little piece that made for a good read. The friendship between the women was great, but with the exception of Roger there were not really any strong male characters in the book. It reminded me of Waiting to Exhale in some ways but I feel this book was better written. It did give food for thought though in Sundi's and Chris' situation because there are a lot of stereotypes out there about dating/marrying African men (they are supposed to be very possessive), but this book gave some insight into the different cultures by talking about what Chris thought. I would recommend this book to some of my other friends, but only if they wanted light reading, nothing thought provoking."
2,KIND OF BAD,"SO GOOD is not a good book. I kept reading it, hoping that it would pick up, provide something new, and gain substance. It never did. It's just a rehash of the same old story of a successful woman needing a man so badly that she accepts anything and is treated badly, as a result. Terry McMillan already has the better corner on this type of book. The ending was absolutely ridiculous and ""little girlish."" Hopefully, this book was the one that failed and all of Ms. Berry's other books are wonderful."
1,Bad Design,"You would think that in some design lab somewhere, when designing a pan, at the very least one would design a pan that would stand on the burner without tipping. That person certainly was not in the lab (garage) where these pans were designed. Upon receiving the pans I immediately noted the weight and length of the handles...too long, too heavy. So I took the pans over to the cooktop and voila, the pans tipped. When I set them on the counter, the pans tipped. Good grief! So I packed them up and returned them. Good riddance!"
4,Pots and pans,"Very pleased with Circulon pans. Very easy to clean. Light weight, which is a plus for us senior citizens. Very excellent cookware."
5,Good stuff,"Let's get this straight, when it comes to kitchen duties I am lazy and I don't like to cook and clean the stuff up. I got this set because I already had the Circulon stir-fry pan and it's always been easy to clean, sits evenly on the burner, and seems very high quality. I can now say the same things for this set. The skillets sit evenly on the burners and seem balanced just fine. If yours aren't, hello, maybe it's an uneven burner?"
2,Sorry to say we don't like it at all,"We bought this encyclopedia (which is nothing like a real encyclopedia) as part of our homeschool curriculum (Sonlight). To be honest, I don't like it at all. It comes across as being very secular. Of course it talks about the big bang theory (presented as fact), evolution, etc. It has a lot of drawn nudity (although not graphic), and even talks about and depicts naked women dancing for pharoahs... Tell me, why did that need to be included in a children's encyclopedia?? Beyond my own dislike for it, my kids absolutely hated it. My 5 year old daughter, who LOVES all things ""school"", would cry and just be devastated when I pulled it out. We have since shelved it and use it only rarely as a picture reference - it has just a little bit of information, but on lot of topics. I'm now searching for something else to replace it."
4,GREAT album from a MISSED metal-ish band.,"Bob Butler is a great guitarist and songwriter and some of my favorite memories from my high school years revolve around BRAIN POLICE gigs in New London, CT. Don't know where he is, but I'm glad these records are out...I have both of them...and I hope he records more.If you like FUDGE TUNNEL or BIG BLACK, you need to check this out!"
4,Almost perfect,"I thought this author was brave..as a Christian author..to cover some of the subject matter so candidly and so realisticly! Many Christians authors write as if godly people have no desires, or sexuality or make any mistakes. I thought the humor in this book was a terrific balance...just delightful all around. I did not give her 5 stars because I felt it was a bit long..but I am glad she didn't end it with a ""happy ever after' for the character...after all...life is not always that way. Besides...it left room for the next book...which I look forward to!"
2,Disappointing,"I wanted so much to enjoy this book, but it was very hard to. Characters that dragged instead of uplifted. A plot that was predictable and boring. The end left me feeling let down and uninspired. The romance was second rate, and nothing about the relationship seemed to flow."
2,Nothing like Deanne Gist!,"I have to agree with some of the other viewers, after reading Lynn Austin and Deanne Gist, (whose writing throbs with meaning and emotion), this simply left me flat. I very rarely put a book aside because I can't get through it, but after struggling through the first third of the book, that's just what I did. I heartily recommend Lynn Austin's Refiner's Fire Series! Candle in the DarknessCandle in the Darkness (Refiner's Fire Series #1)and Fire by NightFire by Night (Refiners Fire Series #2)are two of my all time favorites. I'm sure the third book of that series will be just as outstanding, though I haven't had a chance to read it yet. Eve's Daughter is wonderful, as well."
3,MegaPixels Are Not Everything!,"Interface and controls are a little quirky and seemingly not as user friendly as the DSC-W90 I was replacing. I loved the DSC-W90, but it quit working properly after 1-1/2 years, and Sony wanted $182 to repair it.I was particularly disappointed to find that the DSC-W200 camera does not have the capability to superimpose the date on the picture.If I had it to do over, I would have saved some money and bought the DSC-W80 which is probably more like the W90 I liked so well."
1,This book is full of errors!!!!,PROS-Quick reference guide with two sample exam and solved solutionsCONS-1. This is the THIRD printing of this book and it is still chalk full of errors. If you go to the website www.ppi2pass.com to look at the errata they only have it for the first printing so all those errors were alraedy picked up. THE LAST TIME THEY UPDATED THAT WAS IN 2003!!2. The solutions to the problems are meger at best. Problems are solved out but nothing in depthly. This book is good for a quick reference guide but DO NOT USE IT AS YOUR MAIN STUDY BOOK!3. THERE IS STILL ERRORS IN A THIRD EDITION!
3,Typos galore,"There were a lot of typos and errors that I noticed. Many problems in the review were more complicated than what is actually on the exam. Know that it is not a review of the subjects, it's just example tests with sketchy solutions- not all of which are correct."
5,"Small and lightweight, can't wait to use it!","Great price on a great little lifesaving item. We have this in case of emergency and I can't wait to try it out hiking/camping first. It is small and lightweight, just a little bigger than a soda can. From the item descriptions online, it sounds way better than tablets and should last a long time."
3,wish these were not soooo expensive,"i had only used my miniworks ONCE, was cleaning the filter as recommended, and accidentally broke the ceramic insert. MAJOR BUMMER. nevertheless, it is a good unit and good small size, so i am replacing the ceramic part, and will have to be verrrry careful in the future. wish they weren't so fragile!"
3,one man against the darkness,"having braved incredible dangers and hardships, wearied by his battle against the science-sorcery of the dark empire,Dorian Hawkmoon was returning to his adopted homeland of the kamarg. but even worse awaited him... his betrothed Yisselda had been abducted by the mad god, an evil sorcerer who had usurped the red amulet of the runestaff. even as the destructive shadow of the dark empire spread across the world Hawkmoon knew that only he could rescue Yisselda, and the red amulet from the mad god."
4,Like new,Its not brand new but there is nothing wrong with it that keeps it from serving its purpose for me.
3,Not a great selection of his work,"I'm a big Charlie Hunter fan. I was excited when this retrospective came out. But, listening to it, i was disappointed. Some essential tracks are missing and mediocre ones in their place. As an artist, charlie hunter gets 5 stars, but this disc is weak. I highly recommend Songs from the Analog Playground, Friends Seen and Unseen, and Natty Dread."
1,P-L-E-E-A-S-E,"What a departure from, and a trite story to follow the likes of Alice at Heart. I had anticipated this 2nd in the series for months and months and was so disappointed I had to make myself finish reading it. ""He swept me into his arms from behind, without touching me. He filled my body, filled my mind, nearly absorbed me in a devoted hum of energy."" Now please."
2,Not a good complation,"If you are new to the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem then I would suggest a complation like this to you. There are better ones out there, but this is an okay one to start with. If you are a true fan and are sick of all the complations, then DON'T get this one. Send a petition to Columbia Records demanding that they release the original LP's to CD!Two years later, I'm deciding to edit this review. Not only did Columbia issue this pointless complation, but they screwed with the original sound mix. When comparing this Cd to the original LP's, there is added reverb (echo). Nothing irritates me more then when a remastering engineer thinks they can improve on the original recordings in some way, such as by adding stereo reverb to mono recordings or ruining them with noise reduction. Columbia/Legacy, shame on you!!!"
2,almost useless,Theology-wise it is way-way-way over the head of a lay person like me and I am sure it is way-way-way below respectable level for the professionals in the field.
3,The Summer of a Dormouse,"John Mortimer is a talented writer with true English wit. However, The Summer of the Dormouse falls short. Some of his episodes were previously told in Clinging to the Wreckage. Seventy odd years of life is too long to have repeats."
4,A new way to try,A different way to try and work out. The book talks about new ways to add a little spice in your life.
3,Not bad,"I liked the workout in the book and I think her explanations of the movements are about as good as you're going to get without having a video in front of you. The workout section is a bit of a pain as the movements aren't listed in order in the book, so the first few times you're going to have to flip back and forth and back and forth. I wasn't sure I wanted to order this book based on most of the other reviews being more a review and history of Sheila Kelly's career, but it's not a bad book at all. If you want to see the moves illustrated better I recommend getting the video, although it doesn't show all of the moves in the book. The workout is a lot harder than it looks and I've found a few muscles I didn't know I had before! You might even find that you want to get a pole of you own. I know I sure do! The pole exercises look to be about the most fun you're going to find in a workout."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"I ordered this thinking it would be fun to explore the game. However, after I loaded the 3 codes I wanted and then loaded the game, my controller did not work. I then loaded the game itself and the controlller worked great. Avoid this disk at all costs."
5,Good representation of more psychadelic 70's Isley,"Bought this from a bargain bin in 1996 and haven't removed it from steady rotation yet. The songs are great, but even better, as an album you can really just put it on and let it play. ""Harvest for the World"" caught my attention first, I hadn't heard the intro before this CD. I was blown away. The rest of the cd, in my opinion, doesn't miss. I dig all things Isley, but this is the best period for me. A definite recommendation for fans of this period of their output."
2,Dissapointing,"Watch out! The front cover is misleading. There are no such diagrams or formulas inside the book. Just words, words, like a novel. It makes me fall asleep."
4,Quirky comedy from Belgium . . .,"This trans-Atlantic comedy is an oddly unpredictable mix of story elements and characters that takes us from Belgium to Quebec and back again. The Congo and two World's Fairs figure into the plot, as do missing plans for an electric car, an emu, a solar-powered lawnmower, two restaurant owners (one of them a schoolbus driver with an arm in a cast), lousy French fries and bad coffee, a diamond chip lodged behind someone's left eye, a stroke-immobilized novelist, a village where everyone is named Legros, a birthmark in the shape of Africa, a man in a coma, and so on. The story starts ""two years ago,"" and not only once but twice.The thread of a narrative that holds it all together is the effort of a not-too-successful Belgian inventor to find his Canadian birth parents after discovering in middle age that he's adopted. What he finds along the way is far more than he bargained for. Off-the-wall and enjoyable."
1,Junk Tv,"I bought this TV in Feb this year,went dead in 3 months. The parts are in backorder from Philips (At least that is what i hear from them ) anywayz its been 4 months since the TV went dead and still waiting on Philips to fulfil their warranty commitments. Their customer service is bad. My honest honest opinion is DONT BUY PHILIPS TVS.They are selling junk"
5,Fabulous Musicians With A Lost Skill!!,"...This is a pretty good cd for Sony to put out, as it highlights 3 of possibly the best musiciansof the 1940's generation---The Harmonicatscan blend blues, Pop,and Country intotheir songs, and quite often you hearthem playing notes, and youjust are amazed thatthose notes could be played!! (for ex. the long notes on ""Cherry Pink"", and 'Malaguena"")---These guysare simply good at what they did!!! A good introduction CDinto some of the marvelous skills a pastgeneration of musicians possessed..."
1,Get roof racks and cargo box instead!!!,"I really wish I had just purchased roof racks and a Thule/Yakima cargo box instead of this. The straps go through the doors which doesn't work if you're tall, and the car clip straps scratched my car up. The straps also didn't stay tight, which led to the bag flying off my car at 70mph... Tore up in several places. Thank god no one was behind me at the time or they could have been killed. You can also only store lightweight stuff in it or it will dent in your roof.Complete waste of money in my opinion... Do yourself a favor and spring for quality roofracks and a cargo box."
2,Meh,"Final Fantasy XI presents a enjoyably challenging and redeeming system of play, and it deserves an equally redeeming guide. This how, does not make the cut. Do not be intimidated (or encouraged for that matter) by it's length, because half of it is utterly useless. Not only is it big on uselessness, it's slim on the areas that players could actually use, like strategy of missions/quests and how to acquire items. My final verdict, mediocre at best."
3,Not the best player's guide I have read,"Its not the worst either, but this one could have gone a bit further. I was especially disappointed with the map treatments - most were too small to but useful."
5,Wonderful,"As the previous reviewer stated, the 2nd and 3rd books in this series were disappointing and didn't mention Baxter and Sabina. However, judging this book on its own merit, I loved the characters, especially Sabina and the children, and enjoyed reading this book. I knew the characters from the previous Reardon Valley series so I was not confused with the names in this book."
5,This Bible is a must.,"This Bible is a must for anyone who wants to know what God truely said and what He meant by it. Unlike the majority of study Bibles available today, the information it contains consists of facts and phenomena and not a human's comentary (although the appendixes in the back of the Bible are studies done by Mr. Bullinger and do contain some commentary.) The parrallel column in the Old Testament contain notes taken from the Massorah (compiled by Ginsburg, but written during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah) that are pertinent to the understanding of the Scripture. At this time the Companion Bible is the only source for the English reader of the Massoretic text. This work will help you to discover what, ""Thus saith the Lord"" and why."
5,Great Bible,This Bible was exactly what I was looking for....Everything from the breakdown of the words within the scriptures to the thesaurus in the back of the Bible makes reading and understanding God's word easier...
5,Great Value,"This was a one of a kind find, The book had damage to the cover ( as was stated) And was sold well below the cost of a new undamaged book. the book was a easy fix. Now i have a book good as new at 1/5 of the price of new."
5,The Companion Bible,I am extremely happy with this Bible. My sister bought one many years ago for about 4 times the price I paid for mine. The condition of the book is excellent and it has been used before I bought it. I would recommend this Bible to any of my friends and family. It is a great way to study in depth the word of God. I made a very good decision when I bought this Bible. Thank you very much
2,Hard to Read words from front to back,"This Bible I wanted for studying. It came in the form of trying to look like the old one. This makes it very hard to read. The words looked faded and pictuer copied. I wanted Bullinger's and Bible words to be clear, so I could study it. Insteed is more of an exspencive collectable. So if you are trying for a Study type Bible, this is not for You."
4,Serious Studier,The Companion Bible is an excellent Biblical resource. It has a myriad of information and also displays the King James Version of the Bible along with companion information on each page. Another helpful feature is that it lays out an outline of each book at the beginning of each. This Bible is not for the first time reader. It's only downfall is that it does not appear very user friendly. It takes some concentration to understand the references & explanations. This would be a good Bible for learned person serious about studying the Bible.
4,Fun to read while there,I was in HOng KOng while I read this and that was great fun - reading about the places and sites that I was seeing. I've read a bunch of Jake Graftons and this was just a nice read. Not great but fun.
5,What's Wrong With Some of the Reviews?,"I don't understand where some of the critics get the name Christian Kim from this book. Who is he anyway? Does he write books?As for Sven, I found his book to be marvelous in outlining the Christian position on holy war. Highly recommended to all who are interested on the topic."
5,great job,There is not much to say except a great job all is well. I will buy from this company again.
3,A decent single.,"""Coffee Shop"" was the fourth single off of ""One Hot Minute"", and features the title track backed by two live tracks-- the title track and ""Give It Away"" from ""Blood Sugar Sex Magick"".""Coffee Shop"" is an explosive, powerful, and unlike much of ""One Hot Minute"", bass-driven and funky piece. Flea's bass playing is, unlike much of the record, way out in front, and the frantic live version is full of energy fall surpassing the studio version and adds a blistering jam as a coda. The live take of ""Give It Away"" remarkably feels a bit lifeless and lackluster.Invariably, one live track really limits the value of this, but it's a decent single, fans will probably want to check it out."
3,"Not Bad, but a little larger than expected","I bought this item for my wife who does a lot of traveling on her own. The bag was a little bigger than I thought. It will be a good piece of luggage for longer trips or when we travel as a family . I will need to by a smaller bag for her one or two night business trips.That being said I thought the Garment Bag had a lot of nice features. It will be used primarily as a family travel bag. If the garment bag holds up as well as other reviews have given, it will be worth the price. Judgement is still pending...By the way, I bought the item off Amazon.com. The item was ordered on the 16th of December and I had the bag by the 20th or 21st. I will order again from Amazon.com."
2,Not really that interesting,A documentary about homeless women in america. It could have been done in half the time but still it highlights the plight of the homeless that a lot of us tend to ignore. After 15 minutes I found this film started to get quite boring and tended to repeat the same message over and over again through the medium of different women who by the way are incredible human beings.
2,US Version works great,"The US, single-language-label version of this product works great. The product I received from Amazon, though, included both English and French on the label and may have been intended for the Canadian market. This version did not work well at all: in fact, my trouble spots looked even shinier after application because the Canadian version has a much greasier feel. If you order this product and see French on the label, you're probably out of luck - but if you see only English on the label you may have stumbled onto a wonderful, effective product."
3,Return,The product is fine but the vendor doesn't return messages re.: money due for a return.and the bank billed me $ 10.00 return fee
5,Best Price Anywhere for MUCINEX,"I use Mucinex everyday, 365 days per year. For more than two and a half years, I have been taking the maximum of 2 tablets twice daily, and I haven't had a single sinus infection. I previously had to take antibiotics multiple times per year after colds or allergies settled in my sinuses and caused secondary infections.This is the best price I have found on Mucinex. I need 120 tablets per month so price is an issue. Amazon doesn't charge shipping or tax and it is delivered right to my door. Although it costs more up front, Amazon saves me a lot of money on my indispensible Mucinex.cbc"
3,Ordered bottled tablets on purpose--got foil packs,"OK, this may seem picky to some--but I ordered the medicine in the bottle for a reason. Foil packets were an option, but I chose the bottled ones on purpose. Yes, I got the correct stuff & correct amt.Seller, please update your listings if you don't have the bottles available. The packaging is important to this customer."
2,Mucinex 100-count,"Company sent five packages containing 20 pills each of 600-mg Mucinex rather than the stated 100-pill bottle of Mucinex. No explanation was given for the substitution, nor was there an option to cancel the order and obtain a refund. Very disappointed with this company. I will not order again from it."
3,"Works great, but NOT for 12 hours","I've been batteling a chest/sinus infection for over a week and have been using a Mucinex DM. The directions say to take 1 or 2 tablets every 12 hours. The one pill doesn't do much if anything to help the symptoms. But the 2 pills work great, but only for 6 hours. The directions say to only take 4 in a 24 hour period. I am left congested and coughing my lungs up for 6 hours after each dose. If it said I could safely take 2 pills every 6 hours, it would be 5 stars all the way."
3,"Very effective, though expensive expectorant...","...which is why I give it 3, not 5 stars. It used to be called Humibid (Nathan Lane thanked it in one of his Tony Award acceptance speaches), was obtained by prescription, and if you had a prescription drug program, you could get about 120 six hundred mg. pills for $10.00. The active ingredient is Guaifenisin, and it is quite an effective expectorant, especially if you take the maximum dose of 1200 mg., twice daily.I suppose drug companies make more money by selling it over the counter, which is why they do it, and Amazon is the best price I found (about $5.00 cheaper than CVS),so that's just over 4 times as expensive as the 'good old Humibid days'. There are cheaper generic brands which come in 400 mg. pills, but so far the ones I've tried produce an uncomfortable 'flushing' affect...but that's just me. Thanks, Martin Vidnovic"
1,Lacks focus,"I don't see how you can do justice to the American Soldier, his uniform or equipment in a 71 page book. The subjects are too broad and require much more focus. I found the organization of the book poor - one page you're on WW1, then the 1990's M-1 tank, then to Vietnam. The captions here try to point out what type of uniform the soldiers are wearing, half the time, the photo is too distant to see what the author is talking about.The quality of the color photos are poor- very yellowish tint on about 1/3 of them.This is a book strictly for beginners for an intro into tank warfare from 1918-1999. I do not recommend this book for modelers or anyone who has been studying armored warfare for a long period of time."
3,Their best single to date? I think not.,"You see, if there's anything to know about Duran Duran, I'd know it. I know their most popular albums, and Medazzaland was not one of them. I know their most popular singles, and Electric Barbarella is sure as heck not there. But did it deserve to be there? Was it just some single that was greatly underrated and deserves to be up there?Not at all.Electric Barbarella just irritates me. I don't know what it is; either the horrible cover, the horrible song, the horrible video, or just the horrible transition in all. Relistening to the whole Medazzaland album made me realize that I don't like it. The lyrics were definitely not Simon's best, and it made me almost cry to think that this is the best they could come up with! The remixes are only extended versions of the mediocre song, and ""Sinner Or Saint"" is the only reason you'd want to buy this single.Eh."
2,Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot,"This book is for runners, as a walker it is of limited value."
3,Good but very basic information,"This is what the book says: train at less than 70 percent of your max. Really. Really. I have trained at less than 70 percent of my max and it helped. Others have trained at 70 percent of their max and that helped too.That having been said, he is right, and the book is an easy read and is a good way to get started. The basics of HRM training are very basic, so the style fits. Just don't expect any more than that. Also, this is geared more toward runners than anything.For the opposite approach, check out Friel's Cyclists Training Bible."
4,It's ok!,It's ok. If you are looking for a bilingual book just to introduce some words to your child... it is ok.
3,Good for a chuckle,"I don't think any of the quotes in this book will cause you to laugh to you cry, but you will get a few laughs from some of the quotes and find the rest pretty amusing. A bit overpriced, but worth it if this is a subject you find interesting."
1,Not the best.....,I got this only one thing to say this is good for just free skating but if you take lessons I do not recomend them at all.
2,"Pretty good, except that it only last a couple of times.","This is pretty good, however, it barely makes any foam so you need to use a lot of it when you take a shower, and since the bottle is so small it will last you about a week for just one person."
3,Didn't work for me,Itbdidnt work for me. I also hated having to squirt myself with cold spray right after a hot shower! No thanks!
2,Doesn't work!,I went through 2 bottles of this product with absolutely no results. My acne seemed to have gotten worse. I was disappointed because I love Neutrogena products especially the grapefruit cleanser.
3,Where are the elastic straps?,"I wanted a starter chess set, but one that was durable and would keep the pieces safely stored. I was excited when I read that this set had elastic straps to hold each piece. My disappointment arose when I opened the board and saw that no straps were to be found.. very disappointing and frustrating.Overall, this seems like an okay set (as others have mentioned, the pieces are very light), but I really was set on this one because of those elastic straps."
5,Wonderful!,"I purchased this book for my 8 year old daughter for an assignment in her 3rd grade class. She thoroughly enjoyed the book. Written from the perspective of a young Chinese boy who just immigrated from China, it was really educational for my child. But, she did relate to him in many ways. In the end, it was a great lesson learned."
1,Too much dialogue,"Yang the Youngest and His Terrible Ear is about a Chinese family that has moved from Shanghai to Seattle. The Yangs are all talented musicians except for nine year old Yingtao. Yingtao's father, who is teaching music, has scheduled a recital to help him get more students. But Yingtao's screeching violin won't impress the audience at the recital. I didn't really like the book because there was too much dialogue and not enough action."
1,Over rated,Over rated-Over rated-Over rated. Maybe him and Renteria can hook up. It would be true love. Good luck to Renteria for stabbing us in the back like Brutus. Renteria sucks
3,Good tale... pitiful ending,"The beginning and middle of this book were great, but the ending just didn't make any sense to me. I hope Yves Meynard makes a continuation to this tale because it might clear up the odd conclusion to 'The Book of Knights.'"
3,In my skin,In My Skin is a very hard movie to follow with it being in English subtitles and with every thing going on in the move. If you have a weak stomach for blood or self mutilation this is not for you. This movie is VERY graphic and shows a lot of self mutilation to the point of removal of chunks of skin.
5,On the money !,Just as promised. Well built and all around good product. Not much left to say about it. Get it in bundle if possible.
5,POD HD500,Great product that fits literally perfectly with my POD HD500. Perfect amount of padding and stitching which should make for long lasting durability. Will update if anything happens...
4,"Good bag, ugly logo",The bag seems well made. I haven't seen any problems with the stitching. Comfortable handles and adequate padding. The shoulder strap is nothing to brag about. Just a thin plastic shoulder pad. But that logo? It's ugly.
4,"Toyt (or toight) but, still good for the price","I bought this for the Line6 POD HD500. It's a good quality case/zippers and the HD500 does fit into it but, it's a bit too snug than I would like. I'm worried about the corners of the device rubbing into the case over time. However, I got this puppy for $28 (It just went up a cup o' bucks) and you're not going to do much better than that. I paid $40 years ago for an official Line6 bag for the now disco'd FBV board for the Vetta II head (still in good shape, my review should still be on Amazon...I'm rambling!) and $50+ for the also historic X3 Live, off'l Line6 case is wack, yo. The only other option I can see is the Gator GMULTIFX-2411 but, it's $38 right now and seems to be wider than nessa. And in case you're wondering, yes, like most of our other little toys, it's made in China. BOTTOM LINE: Until something better-fitting comes along, get the GK-2110 for your Line6 PODHD500!!"
2,How to Teach English,"Check the publication date if you need this text for a class, as there is a more current version with a few changes. I cannot see why one would buy this particular book if they were not doing a TFL/ TESOL course, it is rather dry as far as texts go.As for the quality from this vendor, although the book had minimal highlighting and was in decent condition, the DVD was very badly scratched. This should have been sold as the book only. The book could have been 25% cheaper considering the unplayable condition of the DVD."
2,"arrived on time, but in very used condtion","I recieved my purchase in a very timley fashion, but when i opened it, it was full of underlinning and highted ares on every page. I knew when i bought it that it was used but i was led to belive that it was in better condition than how it looked when it arrived, I am hoping it was just a misunderstanding."
3,"Not impressed, but can't complain for 20 dollars","Don't buy the hype. I read the reviews here about the ""crisp high end and huge bass"" and was expecting some good headphones. These are mediocre at best. The bass is present but not strong, the high end is lacking and the mids seem boosted. They don't get very loud, even with devices at full volume (I tried on my laptop, mp3, etc). Also, the color is a steel grey and not white as shown. These headphones will work alright for computer gaming but definitely not for anything serious.-cheap sound-steel grey, not white-not very loud"
1,cheap,"bought these headphones awhile back, and i wish i had returned them the second i got them. they seemed like they would be nice but to bad i never got to use them....the first time i got to try them out i found out that they were broken. looking inside them u could see that the wires inside weren't even connected. if anyone asked me if they should buy them i would say don't waste your money."
2,"Good sound, bad fit, so-so craftsmanship","I've bought a fair number of headphones over the last couple years. Lately, I've had a run of headphones with poor quality. This headphone set seems to be of OK quality. The sound clarity is good. But, the size is terrible. These headphones are very narrow, and the band is very stiff. So, after wearing them for a little while, they feel like having a clamp applied to your head. Also, due to how heavy the headphones are, adjusting them to a larger size where the band doesn't touch your head does not work. The headphones are heavy enough that they will sink down and bend the tops of your ears down.It's a shame really. A few minor changes to their construction, and they'd be very good headphones. So close, yet so far."
4,very good choice,"the quality of the sound produced is very good, the build quality is in mid range but for that price it's really good choiceit comes with adopter so you can use it with mixers as will with the iphone or any other devices.sound quality is top.."
2,STUDIO???,"Well... first let me talk about the quality. The quality is acceptable and I have no complaints in the materials, construction, or sound quality. But as for studio...One would expect a set of studio headphones to isolate and cut out any outside sound or noise. NOT SO with these headphones. The little ring of black slots you see in the picture are just that; SLOTS. And they pretty much let in everything!I probably would have scored these much higher if the title stated, and I was looking for, sound pass-through headphones. As it is, they're not what I needed and I wasted my money on these."
1,Dont buy it,This headphone lasted my husband 2 weeks. Only one speaker plays and I am so disappointed. He uses it for his home studio and he has a behringer board. Cant believe it only lasted 2 weeks I am so upset.
3,Sounds like $20,"Just got these in after ordering last week. I really just needed some cans for vocalist to use instead of in-ear monitors. I was hoping that these would at least sound somewhat decent, which they do. But if your wanting great clarity, you get what you pay for. ALWAYS. These will work fine for tracking, they can put out enough volume and they are pretty isolated, so not too much noise will bleeding through, such as a click track. As far as the sound in itself, they are extremely MID heavy. Almost no highs and no lows. The EQ band seems to be pretty narrow, which in-turn cuts layers off that crystal clear tone that your ears want to hear. All being said, they are extremely affordable and are a decent bang for the buck."
2,Dissapointing,"I bought these headphones expecting to get what I paid for. Well in a way I did, the sound quality is good but I am disappointed with the overall product. I have had them for all but a week and the jack end is already starting to cut in and out. Even the first time I plugged them in the balance seemed to be left heavy from my computer. I got them to use as a monitor while recording guitar work, and will not recommend them to anyone. If you are looking for a low end head set to throw around and not care about this is you product. Otherwise make the smart move unlike me and buy a better (more $) item."
4,great sound but tight fit,"I wish there was a way to make the headphone pinch less. I do have a rather large head, 7 1/2 hat size. it's adjusts just fine length wise, but no way to make it wider. i can't wear them more than 20-30 without getting a slight tension headache-this could become a problem during long recording sessions.but overall the sound is great."
1,Dont Buy,"This happens to be the worst item to spend your your money on. I live in the Bahamas and i ordered this head phone on line so i had to wait a few day to get it but once i got it and tried it out, it sounds ok but it just start to fall apart on tha first night i had to use it. I wish i could get my money back, spend the extra and get something worthwhile."
3,the cable looks a little weak,"in the joint between the headphones and cable and cable and jack , looks a little weak to me, a recomend putting some tape to prevent it from bending and getting damaged."
4,Really great for the price,"I bought these alone with some other headphones and they've been working great. The volume is a little low but i can get over that. They sound quality is the best your probably going to get for the price(probably even better than other brands with headphones prices up to like 45 dollars. Someone sat on them one time and one of the speacker wire came lose, but it was a very simple soldering fix."
4,Great sound for the price.,"Based on the other reviews, I agree these are very good sound quality for the price. Most of the headphones in this price range seem to be optimized for folks who want killer bass in their ears. I was looking for faithful sound reproduction and clear sound. These definitely provide clear sound across the frequency range. They are comfortable to wear and surprisingly lighter than they look."
3,too much interview,"I read this book to help me understand the changes in my girlfriend. there was some useful information regarding this subject, but the book is mostly testimonials about women finding out it is okay to have a sex life when they are older. I didnt need a book to tell me that, and the information could have occupied a single chapter. Interesting read, and will be more so for women than men, especially those seeking factual information vs. insightful interviews. lots of the latter, little of the first."
1,"blah blah blah blah, vomit.....","I had a passage while I read this book. I believe it was called the 'oh my god what am i doing wasting my time reading this silly book when i can be watching dr. phill' passage. I'm 55, and I'm very happy being 55, not thinking i'm somewhere between 40 and death, but actually saying hey, i'm 55 and that's great. There's nothing wrong with age, unless you are obsessed about looking like you are 30 when you are 55. But if that's your problem, then you have other issues. In either case, this book won't help you. Here's what will, be happy with who are you, no matter your age, and you will be in good shape. Or you can read this book and have the same passage that I had."
2,Kikkoman Instant Miso Spinach Soup,"Packing delicious flavor and convenience, Kikkoman Instant Miso Spinach soup offers a tasty treat. However, because it contains Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), we avoid it altogether.Maybe the inventors will consider omitting MSG in the future (?)."
2,Boring,I would rank this cd the lowest of my middle eastern collection. The songs were not uplifting and not satisfying for an international audience. Camelspotting did not capture my curiosity and did not guide my imagination to the desert and camels that I was hoping to come in contact with.
3,Interesting Record of an Unlikely Encounter,"Within the rock/pop context in which they normally perform, Fagen and Becker can appear accomplished, even downright sophisticated. Here, in terms of both what they play and what they have to say, they seem a bit out of their depth and occasionally come across as poseurs -- sort of like when they attempted to play Ellington's ""East St. Louis Toodle-oo"" on their ""Pretzel Logic"" lp. It's also rather jarring to hear a white man in the 21st century sing about ""that high brown of mine,"" as Fagen does in ""Hesitation Blues.""On the other hand, McPartland is a game and gracious hostess (as always). Well aware that Fagen and Becker lack the technical proficiency of the musicians she usually interviews, she doesn't ask too much of them, and her own playing is comparatively restrained, though beautiful and brilliant (again, as always). Though the interactions between her and her guests are somewhat awkward at times, they are also quite interesting."
4,I like this timer,"I like this timer, because I like colors. Also, I like the fact that it has batteries that are easy to get anywhere (3 aaa's)The timer turns green at 1 minute, yellow at 30 seconds, and red at 10 seconds. When the minutes are up, it flashes in all the colors. If you're in bright sunlight, the colors don't really show up, and maybe it's just me, but the timer alarm doesn't seem very loud, so I'll see the colors change even if I miss the alarm.."
2,"Looks Nice, Dies Young...","I bought one of these, based on experience with a different Polder model. However, segments of its LCD numerals began to fail after about 6 months, making it impossible to read. I bought a second one. Its ""Start/Stop"" button failed in about 6 month. Both of these units had very light household use under clean conditions. Verdict: Looks nice, but is basically junk in terms of reliability."
4,Kitchen timer,this small little timer works nicely fit out of the way and can be heard and seen from along way off great piece of kitchen equiptment
1,"great at first, but did not last","We purchased this timer just over four months ago, it worked great until this week when the display stopped working. Only part of the first number displays, making it useless once you set the timer for over 10 minutes. The timer has also begun to beep at random times when it is not even in use (this was first noticed in the middle of the night). The beeping has continued to occur in spite of replacing the batteries. I would not recommend purchasing this product."
2,Good Design; Disposable Quality,"We've had 2 of these, and they both stopped functioning properly after a few months. They were never dropped, abused or misused; they simply stop working. It's too bad, because the design and functionality is quite good while it worked.We've since bought a LUX CU100Lux CU100 Digital Count Up/Down Timer, White, and have been very pleased with both its design and durability. What's more, it's less expensive than the Polder."
3,A 3.5 star review,"I was recommended this book, and being an avid reader of anything to do with Carthage or Rome, I bought it at once. It's an 'old' book, being printed in 1960, and has been translated from its original German.The central protagonist is a nameless boy who is found in the rubble of Saguntum (the town which saw the beginning of Hannibal's war on Rome) by Suru, one of the Carthaginian elephants. Taken on by Suru's driver, he follows Hannibal on his epic march over the Alps. The historical facts are accurate, but unfortunately, they often get offered as large chunks of narrative rather than through what happens directly to the boy or Suru. Nonetheless, the characters are warm and well drawn, and Suru is a pleasure to read about.All in all, it was an enjoyable read, and well worth it for children who are interested in the time period. However, the book's not up to the same standard as Sutcliff'sThe EagleorRoad to Miklagardby Henry Treece.Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion."
5,Wonderful stroller,"Great stroller. My 3 year old fell in love with it in the store and insisted we push her around the store in it. My newborn fits safely in with the seat reclined and all 5 restraints. We took both girls to the aquarium on day 5 and 7 of the newborn's life and both loved the stroller. It manuevers easily and has great sun visors. Also, the stroller folds up easily and compactly and fits easily in our car. One thing we miss are the trays for snacks and drinks, but understand it wouldn't fold so easily with those and have opted for the snap-on ones instead."
4,So far so good,"This is my first hard drive and have had no problems with it, it works nicely on the Mac OS X. I use it to backup personal files, pictures and music for a MacBook Pro through a Firewire800.On the outside it has nice looks with its clean aluminum finish and orange rubber bumper. The rubber bumper is removable/replaceable and actually feels good in your hand. I read reviews it was pretty cheap but to me it looks good, it keeps the hard drive from slipping on hard surfaces.Transfer speed is pretty good; actually, faster than using the USB in a Windows laptop. The only bad thing is that it will require two USBs on some computers, one for data transfer and one for power."
4,Easy and effective,The backup software is easy to use and very fast. The hard drive itself has been very hardy (so far). And the speed of a FireWire drive makes me not want to even consider a USB one.
1,"slow, flimsy, unreliable","bought this hard drive, worked ok - kind of slow even at fire wire 400, then it broke - lost a bunch of data, took 3 hours and 15 more bucks to contact lacie, return, etc. got it back repaired not even new. still slow and now I don't trust it. Ya it's got rubber around it, so what, it's designed by a designer not a user. I would make it bomber not beautiful. Any way I bought a G-drive, works great and fast. By the way this is the second lacie product that has failed for me, altogether 6 hours to contact, remedy, return, etc. this second one was a Quadra. My advice - get a raid array from a company other than lacie."
5,LaCie delivers again,"This is my fourth LaCie Rugged hard drive. I do a lot of on-site video editing and audio recording. I've read lots of reviews about this hard drives, saying that they're not so reliable, but to be quite honest, after four of these (I bought the first two years ago), I can speak for LaCie quality. Way to go!"
5,Will of Dwelling,"The book is not only a very fine collection of some beautiful art works, but it's designed to show the architect's will behind the drawing, the strong passion that guides the definition of dwelling spaces. There are some of the best known houses of modern times, but also some precious jewels of hidden popularity. Definetly, a marvelous book to ""possess""."
3,Let the price be the indicator,"These sheets are OK, but certainly dont feel as soft as other 400 tc sheets that I own. They are thick, which i think gives them a rougher feel. They are better than average store-bought sheets, but not as high quality as I thought they'd be."
3,Sheets,The sheets are very soft as described. They were not as deep pocketed as the description said. Overall I am satisfied with them!
1,Item Differed from Stated Description,"The first shipment of the King sheet set was in Ivory & not White as ordered, & package said fits up to 16"" mattresses, Amazon's stated description said fits up to 18"" mattresses. Customer Service promptly said they would correct, but the second shipment was the exact same as the first. We returned both via UPS & are awaiting the nearly $11 in UPS charges. First disappointment with an Amazon order we've experience."
1,"Looks nice out of the package, but doesn't last long","Feels nice fresh from the package, despite the loose threads (poor-quality sewing I'm sure). After 3 washings, they are starting to pill. They have also shrunk, and fitting them on the bed is now a very tight squeeze. Definitely not 400TC, and definitely not Egyptian cotton. Waste of $20!"
5,the best ever,"the thread count is excellent on these egyptian cotton sheets, really something worth considering. its like sleeping on clouds, in heaven, in the sky, where god lives."
2,Not Exactly What I expected,The sheets were not as soft as others in the store. Also my flat sheet has a pink hue to it. Interesting for being a white sheet set!
2,Not quite white.,"Someone else reviewed these as having a yellowish cast; mine are definitely on the pink side. The sheets themselves feel nice to the touch, but the color looks way off compared to my (true) white comforter."
3,Lilac? I hardly think so,"I opened the package this morning to put these sheets on my bed. I know lilac and this certainly is NOT LILAC. It is a nice light blue.I pulled off a 500 count pima cotton sheet and even though this is egyptian cotton, it was obvious that these were inferior.Functional - pass on these - I am sure there is a better value to be had here on amazon"
1,Waste of $20,"Feels nice fresh from the package, despite the loose threads (poor-quality sewing I'm sure). After 3 washings, they are starting to pill. They have also shrunk, and fitting them on the bed is now a very tight squeeze. Definitely not 400TC, and definitely not Egyptian cotton. Waste of $20!"
2,Not exactly elegant....,"These sheets are not terrible for the price ($39.99), but be warned that they are not very luxurious. They are certainly heavier than your typical sheets. After 3 washings they are starting to feel a bit ""fuzzy"", like after you wash flannel sheets a few times. They do NOT have a smooth luxurious feel to them at all. On a good note, the lilac color is very soft and subdued. I do not recommend these sheets if you are looking for sheets that feel wonderful. I do recommend these sheets if you are looking for a good deal and do not care what they feel like. Update: These sheets have grown on me. They still aren't what I'd consider luxurious, but they feel better than flannel sheets."
1,This is a ripoff,"Description states that this fitted sheet will fit matresses up to 18"". When it arrived, the container states up to 16"". However the pocket is only 14"" so there is no way it will fit a 16"" matress let alone an 18"" matress. It may actually work with a 12"" or possibly a 13"" matress."
4,Luxury Feel & Fit At A Great Price!,"We have previously purchased three sets of these sheets, and are very happy with them. They fit well, and come out of the wash almost wrinkle free, if removed promptly.I think some don't understand the importance of washing and drying 100 Cotton correctly. One must follow the instructions exactly. That means, cold or warm wash, the use of a good fabric softener, and drying ONLY on ""Low"".Egyptian Cotton is the ultimate, and I have paid what Amazon says is the ""regular"" price, and more, at the big box stores. If you understand how to properly wash and dry fabrics, or at least can follow instructions, you will love the almost silk-like hand of these sheets, and appreciate their longevity of service!"
5,What would Lang Lang think?! *gasp*,"I'm only kidding about my review title. I'm sure he would love it. However, the camera work / performance demeanor - well, as other reviewers imply, it's not likely to catch the eye of your typical 21st century teenager (his face is probably planted in his iPhone anyway). Oh well! I'm actually glad that the camera isn't swerving around in lunatic fashion, with fancy fades here and nauseating twists there. This is more akin to a Gouldian production. We see what we need to see: arms! hands! And occasionally a face! :)This is a treat. Thoughtful, solid, emotional (inner) and oh-so-Germanic. There really is something so enigmatic, so private, so pensive about Michelangeli's playing. We would do well to study this more introspective approach to art.I highly recommend this performace. Despite Mr. Michelangeli's flagrant addition of a low B (left hand, last measure of Ballade no. 4). It sure sounded nice on that Steinway... ;)"
2,Strictly a novelty item.,"This work of dada fiction is a nice novelty item, but one that is not meant to be taken seriously in any regard. The chapters are not necessarily related, and the novel is easier to swallow in small doses. Though dada and surrealism have often overlapped, they are not mutually exclusive. For me, the novelty wears off quickly, and otherwise I am not exactly the biggest fan of Hugo Ball's 'art'. I greatly prefer Nadja by Andre Breton (another headfigure in dada and surrealism) and The Eater of Darkness by Robert M. Coates, which are much more interesting as far as dada-influenced works go."
5,Sharing History's Wisdom,"This album, performed by a masterful violinist, not only delivers beautifully arranged and delightful music, IT weaves beautiful innate wisdom of the ancients into its message. Thank you Arvel.We need more souls to step forward, as Arvel has, and bring their powerful and much needed messages which will otherwise be missed.Nuwati, Lauren Taite Vines""Wisdom of the Ancients: Eye of the Eagle"""
1,Mis-print on ad,"The balls are ""okay"" crumble pretty easywas disappointed with the ad and the price, but who cares!"
1,irritation,I tried derma pods twice wish itchy rashes as a result both times. The skin just came off.
2,disappointing,Saw this movie when I was a kid. It was much better when I was 13. Sooo glad I decided to rent it before buying.
4,A deservinng winner of the caldicot award.,"I read this book in my sixth grade year, this was one of the first books that I ever read, this book was the reason I like reading today."
3,A movie with a lot of promise,"Nolan's first might look a lot like a student film, but the writing and direction show the promise of what this director would become. A good one to watch for aspiring filmmakers."
4,3 1/2 stars for an early Christopher Nolan film,"This is director Christopher Nolan's first film as I understand it. Released in 1998, it is kind of ""Memento"" training film. Nolan not only directs but produces, edits, photographs, writes and probably cooked lunch on this film. Shot in black and white on a shoestring budget, he still manages to keep it interesting. Our lead character, known as ""The Young Man"" (Jeremy Theobold) is kind of a weirdo who follows people just for fun. When he's caught by one of the followees (Alex Haw) he's lured into a game of burglary. A game because, making money isn't the motive. The movie goes back and forth in time, certainly an early example of this style. Fortunately I managed to keep up most of the time. Short and sweet (70 minutes). Watch for a Batman icon on the door to ""The Young Man's"" apartment. An omen of things to come for Nolan in 2005."
5,All God's Creatures,This book was an excellent read. I love animals and was so glad to find that the story was about the animals and not especially about the people. There was enough of each to hold the interest and not get maudlin or overly dramatic. I can visualize very well and was gratified to read lovely description done just right. There was just enough dialogue and description to satisfy anyone and keep the action going. A GOOD READ.
5,AGC wonderful story for all,"All God's Creatures is about an unlikely Southern debutante in 1960s Memphis who becomes a large animal veterinarian. Gawky, restless, smart and opinionated, young Maggie McLain isn't cut out to fill the patent leather pumps of a Southern belle. When she ditches a Cotton Carnival ball to save a drowning pup, Maggie realizes her destiny.Over the years, Maggie earns the devotion and respect of crusty farmers, snobby horse breeders and doubtful pet owners throughout western Tennessee. She's an inspiration to up-and-coming women vets, a loving wife to her proud husband, a patient mother to her demanding kids, and above all, a champion to sick and injured animals.This is a wonderful story for the whole family. The stories in the book are both heart-felt and fun. McSparren's love of animals and joy of story-telling come out in this book."
5,loved it,"I have loved this book. I loved James Herriot and have never found anything remotely as wonderful in his genre. However, this book is a gem. I loved the humor, the pathos, the humanity, and the love of animals that this book portrayed. It is a gem."
4,"Wonderful book, I keep wanting more.",What a surprising and delightful book. Couldn't help but feel it was an autobiography even though I knew better. Every emotion possible from love and joy to fear and heart break made it seem so real. The medical stories with the animals were wonderful. If I have a complaint it would be there wasn't enough detail. I kept wanting more. I'll read more of her books now.
3,Enloyed,I enjoyed reading this book. It was not one of those that you couldn't put down. It was more of a put it down pick it up tomorrow or later today. It was interesting and easy. I like books that you can pick upAnd put down sometimes. It held my interest mostly.
1,Directly from Amazon,"The fragrance house itself is great, the product Amazon sent me was no good.The serial number was shaved off of the bottle and cut out from the bottom of the box, the bar code below the UPS on the box was cut out and replaced.The fragrance itself smells like a watered down version of the real thing and lasts maybe 30 minutes.I know Amazon would not sell poor product intentionally. Not sure if this is the same you would find with the 3rd party sellers."
4,Nettwork's Yearly Indie Christmas,"The previous reviewer seems to be basing everything on the title of the album. This is most certainly not a 50's collection with Johnny Mathis. This is Nettork Records second annual Christmas release of (mostly) chestnuts performed by (mostly) indie acts. It's a very pleasant, very adult alternative station-ready collection with a few absolute standouts like Leigh Nash and Gabe Dixon's clear-voiced rendition of ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", the Clumsy Lovers bluegrass-inspired take on ""Welcome Christmas"" and Sarah McLachlan's shiny, soaring ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day."" This collection would be fine background music for any young, upper-middle class Christmas party."
1,cliches,"Cliches exist for a reason. Because mostly they are true, which is how they got so widely known. But that is not en excuse to write an entire book of them.A cliche in a book, or a bunch of them, could work. But only if it is done by turning the cliche around or making a point of it. It needs to surprise you. If you can't do something interesting with something that is already a cliche, then it's pointless, because it's all been done before.That sums up this book. It is entirely cliche and flat, but it has no redeeming quality to it. The cliche stays cliche and doesn't surprise you. That's not very entertaining."
1,Sorry.......,"This was awful. Novel writing is not a popularity contest, it's about telling a story and having richly written characters. The story has been told a billion times and this particular story doesn't add anything fresh to it. And the characters are just ridiculous. I can't even say in regards to the whole Legend of Zelda fanfic thing if they are ""in character"" or ""OOC"" because there is NO character to them."
1,painfully bad,"It's like an emotional ten year old wrote this. My cat has more depth of experience than I found in this ""story"", and story is in quotes because it's not so much a story as it is a rehashing of other stories. She didn't even rip off anything original, she actually ripped off cliches.Aspiring writers take note: vanity press is not the way to go."
3,Perfect Blocks in Minutes,Have just started paper piecing quilting & find this book very down to earth and understandable & user friendly.
2,A good idea that falls flat on its face,"It seemed to me that author Lynn Collum forgot the first rule of writing good fiction: Show, don't tell. Throughout the book, Collum tells us what each of her characters think (you are in the minds of no less than 6 characters), tells us why they do what they do, and tells us what we should think of her characters. The characters remain static and undynamic--what you read it what you get. Ultimately, the writing is stilted and pedantic.The plot is a good one. In fact, I think it is excellent. The main characters advocating for their chosen heiresses. Unfortunately, there is an inherent plot hole in this book that you could drive a truck through: why doesn't the inheritance get split between the 3 candidates? It seems so obvious to me, but it took the author 200 pages before she considered it.The one redeeming factor of this book is the dialogue. If you can, read the dialogue and skip the rest. In 30 minutes, you will have read what was worth reading."
3,DJ Wally - The Creepy Crawlies,"The Creepy Crawlies has the subtitle, ""A Soundtrack to a Make Believe Movie,"" but by all accounts, it's most likely a horror movie. The album is full of the dense, paranoid trip-hop for which DJ Wally is known. He's the only person who can transform the oldies rock classic ""Rock Around The Clock"" into something scary (it appears as a sample on ""Smoke""). The cheery sample at the end of ""Spilling Over"" soon gives way to the slowed down orchestra of ""Hybrid Sermon."" If you want something to give you nightmares, try ""Terrorific."" The harp and moaning on ""Fetish"" (followed, by someone singing about being naked!) makes you feel dirty just listening to it. A few of the tracks go on beyond what seems like their natural lifespan and become undead, but it only seems appropriate for this eerie album."
1,Rated 1 Star for Price,I don't see why this is priced from $199 to $299 new and $141 used. This makes no sense.I'd suggest checking out the following:The Music of Cosmos: Selections from the Score of the PBS Television Series Cosmos by Carl SaganI don't know if it is still available.
2,"Blah, but two and a half stars anyway.","Not as good as you may have heard. A couple of good tracks, but save the cash by the new Daft Punk."
5,Wonderful History of Memories,Lots of good memories of the Automats that I visited during my youth. Detailed history with lots of pictures.. Well worth being featured on the coffee table!
1,Very Disappointed,"I was actually looking forward to this book. But it's a real disappointment. It's very small in size, the photos are tiny for the most part and the text and captions are difficult to read. I'm surprised that Clarkson Potter would produce a book like this. I grew up in Philly going to Horn and Hardarts and I was hoping the book would also deal more with the Philly automats, but it is centered more on New York automats and very boring celebrity quotes. Who really cares what Tony Curtis says about eating there. I feel I gottaken...BTW I didnt buy it from Amazon but used from another online book vendor. My advice is save your money. It's not a fun read -- if you can even read it."
2,"Good nostalgia, inauthentic recipes","Waiting with bated breath to try the recipe for Horn & Hardart's ""authentic"" macaroni and cheese, which I remember well from childhood, it was immediately apparent that this recipe is far from ""authentic"". The original recipe used a large, straight macaroni, while the book's recipe calls for ""elbow macaroni"". Oops. The original had bits of tomato, the book's recipe omits the tomato. Oops again. I didn't care to try what is clearly misrepresented as ""authentic"".Having said that, the nostalgia and history aspect of the book is quite good. But having purchased the book for the recipes, this was very disappointing. If you enjoy reading the history of the automat, this book is for you. If you're considering buying the book for the ""authentic"" recipes, save your money."
1,I THINK DONE FOR MONEY NOT STORY!!!!,"It is very rare I start a book and not finish it no matter how bad it is but I only read about forty pages of this one. I wish there was some way for Mr. Johnstone to give me my money back. About half the forty pages were flashbacks of previous books. I used to love his Mountain Man Series but I quit reading them because he would spent a big part of the book with pages of what happened in a previous book. Now I will quit reading the Last Gunfighter series. I guess you make as much money doing this and you don't have to think up as many new things to write, just repeat what you have already written. In my openion it is bad for an author with this ability to take advantage of people that do not know these thing until they buy the book. It should be noted on the cover of this and other books he has done: BEWARE--ABOUT HALF OF WHAT YOU READ IS IN A PREVIOUS BOOK!!!!"
5,Very Good,This is a very good book on the Kingdom Parables. The insight and notes are a great benefit for pastors and laymen a like.
2,DARK!!!,"I'm 3 quarters done with the book. This book really is a deviation from the original Wayfarer trilogy. She throws mud on all her characters and leaves you not knowing who to root for. For the first half of the book I was rooting for the 'bad' guys. She takes Axis and Ashure of the first trilogy and turns them into trite, half brain dead incompetents (The little they show up in the book). I'm hoping as I go into the 2nd and 3rd book she somehow redeems someone. She seems to have taken a very dark turn when she wrote the 'Hades Daughter' and hasn't come back."
3,The beginning of the end,"The ties that binded this mythology together begin to unravel. As I enjoyed the first three, it is a sad thing to have to say, but the characters leave much to be desired, the story is splintered, and the brutality is often unnecessarily gruesome."
4,Good story Unlikable characters,I continue to be torn in my opinion about Ms. Douglass. She writes great stories but... I kind of like to have some characters that are people that you would like to know for one reason or another. Almost none of the characters have any character. If you don't mind a story where everyone seems to betray every one you should like this.
3,Shopkeeper Bell,"The bell is well made and has a nice tone. I did not give it a five-star review because of the following: When I mounted the bell on the door with screws, using the two holes for that purpose, I found that the bell did not ring unless I opened the door rather violently. When the door was opened slowly, the bell either did not ring or rang very faintly so that it could not be heard. In the end, I mounted a wind chime on the door, which was less expensive and rings even when the door is opened slowly. I'm still looking for a way to mound the shopkeeper's bell so that is works."
3,Not a very durable toy.,"(...) Donkey's head does not stay on for an entire play session. It is easy to replace, but with the parts being so small they can be easily lost. Nice to have to complete the set, but not very practical."
3,"Table , table, where's the table","An annoying tendency of certain books is to provide so many tables, figures and examples that you get lost trying to find ex A figure 2.x or Table Z. This book excels in this regard. It would have been clearer if a single, global, numbering system had been used to refer to ANY AND EVERY example in the book rather than non-collated links all over creation. A simple pg. number IN ADDITION TO!!! the figure/table/example/chart/drawing - whatever-number ... would have sufficed.Terrible awful stuff having to hunt down what you want mid-sentance."
5,Teaching Academic Esl Writing: Practical Techniques in Vocabulary and Grammar,I am vary satisfied with the quality of service and book condition. I received everything on time.I would rate this service as excellent.Thank you.
5,A 'must' for any photographer's tool kit!,"Jeff Smith's CORRECTIVE LIGHTING, POSING & RETOUCHING tells how to make subjects look their best using different lighting and posing techniques for studio or location setups. From digital techniques for minimizing defects to addressing common age- and weight-related issues, this is a 'must' for any photographer's tool kit!"
5,Good book - other reviews are accurate,"I cheated here and for the first time, I read other reviews first.Why reinvent the wheel....what other people said is true! ;-)This is a good book. I have been a big fan of Jeff Smith for a while. This book will take you through a logical work flow of a shoot.Sorry to be short but most other reviews said what I would have said!"
2,why is she a best seller??,"Catherine Coulter, either needs to become a romance writer or a mystery writer, but she tries to combine the two, and it doesn't work. I would not reccommend this book to anyone that likes a well written mystery, but would reccommend it to those that enjoy a book that has unrequited love, 9 unsuccessful murder attempts, and foolish unbelievable FBI agents."
4,"Not her best but,","I liked Lily and Simon a lot and hope to read their story. Always like reading about Savich and Sherlock. I have to say though that if I ever hear the word ""gnarly"" again, I may be sick."
1,Hemlock Bay is poisonous to a readers mind,"Don't waste your time on this one.There is not one likeable character in this book.Dillon is perfect, Sherlock (and what's w/that name?)is the only woman who has ever given birth to a perfect child.Simon Russo is smart,sexy and oh yes, he was once married, but divorced and was she a secretary? Of course not, she's now a 2 star general.And Dillon and Lily's Mom. She's dating a garbageman,right? No way, he's a U.S. Congressman (thank God we didn't get both of them in the book)."
1,Beware,"This is NOT a mystery. This is a romance masquerading as a mystery. I hated it; I gagged over Nick-n-Nora, aka Dillon and --would you believe? -- Sherlock; I quit reading it about halfway thru. I truly dislike those romance novelists who are trying to parlay a rep in that genre into one in my escape genre of choice, mysteries."
1,Unbelievable!!!,"I have always been a big fan of Catherine Coulter. I have read all her books. That's why I was so unbelievably disappointed in this book. I felt cheated for buying the book. The plot is really stupid. There is no suspense or romance. Catherine Coulter who has always been known for her great contemporary & historical romances, should go back to writing the way she use to. If she wants to write a good suspense novel, she should take a lesson from Nora Roberts or Linda Howard."
1,First and Last,"Of the books I've finished (and there are very few that are so bad that I could not get through them) sadly, this is the worst. Perky Lily has nine lives. She has a car accident, then surgery. Is released from the hospital, then fights off an attacker, then goes on to write cartoons, the same day. That is just the beginning of her adventures. This is just one of the plot lines that strains credulity. It appears that the other stories about these characters may have been better, but it's hard to believe that the person who wrote this book could actaully write something that anyone would spend time reading. Hopefully, what other reviewers and more long time readers of the series say is true: that the author could not have sanctioned this book."
1,Hemlock bay,Very disappointing. Not one of her best. two story lines. one really out there. The other okay. I found myself skipping pages just to get to the end. Glad I borrowed it and not bought it.
4,Good,"Frankly, I'm surprised at all of the mediocore and negative reviews. I thought the book was Catherine Coulter through and through. I have been struck with how some of her heroines come off as superhuman. Enduring calamity after calamity. Kinda over the top. But the story lines keep you engaged. This is one of her books that have several story lines going at once. It also encompasses the supernatural as some of her other books have done. It's quite interesting. Many of the reviews wanted an explanation of the supernatural events. But that's just the point. There is no logical explanation. If there was, it wouldn't be supernatural. Great read folks."
3,Triple jeopardy,Good for short stories. I now remember why I a not a big fan of Nero Wolfe. I obviously do not think the way he does.
4,Painful revelations for Russell lovers,"I wanted to name my son ""Russell"" (if I had a son), at one point. In college and (philosophy) grad school I was a tremendous admirer of Russell, in particular his ""On Denoting"" and other explications of how language and logic works. As a college student in the late '60s I was also impressed and influenced by his staunch (and early) opposition to the Viet Nam war.So reading The Ghost of Madness was a sad revelation. I had already read, with great enjoyment, Monk's Duty of Genius and Spirit of Solitude, but this volume took me quite a while to get through, cause on nearly every page there was another revelation of Russell's pettiness, and just-plain-meanness, especially to his schizophrenic son and granddaughter, Lucy.Monk's other 2 main works deserve 5 stars, this one one less cause he lost any semblance of an ""objective"" biographer's stance (I know I know ""objectivity"" is problematic...), starting with the preface and acknowledgements."
1,Pulp!,"The book is essentially a form of ?tabloid scholarship.? Mr. Monk is more interested in bedroom tales than with the impact of the awe-inspiring humanism of Earl Russell. The fabrications and mischievous assertions appear to be inspired by some right wing streak which results in a lack of a modicum of integrity and honesty.Russell?s work as a mathematician, a philosopher and as a humanist, towers above such sensational publications, and of course, outlasts them many generations to come."
2,disappointing,"I found this book disappointing. Its mostly several shots of one show for each artist, and alot of them arent even that great. They are pics pretty much anyone in the audience with a camera couldve taken themselves. There's also very little info on most of the pics..not even the year they were taken. There are a few gems though..like the shots of the Misfits but over all i found the book boring. For the low price i paid though i guess i shouldnt complain, but i have personally taken more intersting pics at concerts with a disposable camera. The 4 crappy photos of Andy Warhol at the end of the book kind of surprised me too..very out of place. Im a huge Warhol fan but what was he doing in this book??"
3,Not so much...,"I love Fantasy, but this one almost has a grape smell to it. Also, it doesn't last as long as Fantasy."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"MIDNIGHT FANTASY is strong on the fruit notes. The notes of plum & cherries stayed with me all the way through the floral hearts notes. The result was that I couldn't separate any of the floral notes.The vanilla in the base was also very subtle; I could pick out the musky tones. I'd have thought the base would be sweet, but it's not. MIDNIGHT FANTASY is all about the fruity notes. It failed to remind me of the original FANTASY; I don't know why it wasn't marketed as a new fragrance, instead of Fantasy: 2.Personally I love plums & cherries so I do adore MIDNIGHT FANTASY, though I have to remove a star as it can be sickly in warm weather. I'd stick to autumn/winter for this.Scent notes: Black cherries, framboise, plum, orchid, freesia, iris, musk, amber and vanilla."
3,My Own Ground,"Although My Own Ground is an interesting comment on the positive aspects of a Marxist society, Nissenson becomes overhanded in his portrayal of this utopian Marxist society. Nissenson portrays the positive aspects of a Marxist society, but never takes a close look at the abuses of power that can occur with a Marxist society. The novel centers on a woman who becomes a prostitute because she is unable to support herself in a capitalistic society. Although there are very real problems with a strictly capitalistic society, I feel that this book portrays Marxism as the absolute way to live in society. Although overall it was a good novel, perhaps if he had not been so overt in his intentions, it would have been a better novel."
5,A MUST SEE!,"This documentary helps you to understand a little bit about what our solders are thinking when they come home from the war. The condition is know as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This explains how the war affects our solders. If you have loved ones or know someone who served or is serving over seas, this is a MUST WATCH!"
1,One of the most over-rated books consultant never read,"Nothing like taking a perfectly simple concept, make it sound as complex as possible by adding enough buzz words like ""time order"" or ""sequential analysis"" and shoe-horned them into some sort of generic S-C-Q order, brand it a mystique name like ""Pyramid Principle"", then package it into a consulting ""methodology"". The whole concept can be summarized as follow,- Start with a broad summary, tell a story to set the scene.- Arrange ideas into related groups.- Provide supporting evidence, dig deeper into details.Most people learn that in college if not high school, nothing special really.NB: my copy is a revised 2009 edition."
5,Easy principles to get organized,"One of the first steps in building an effective business presentation or document is getting your thoughts organized. I found the Pyramid Principle head and shoulders above any other book I've read.Barbara's concepts are simple and intuitive, but take a bit of practice to master. Once you do, you find yourself organizing all your communications -- emails, PowerPoint decks, blog articles -- along her principles. The effect is clearer and more interesting writing.I recommend this book to all my workshop participants. It's a must-read for business managers."
5,Lifetime air filter,"I wish I had thought of this the first time I was replacing my OEM air filter. It would have save me more money in the long run. Great product, easy to install."
5,Stichn' Bitch,Fantastically written book. Easy to understand. Illustrations are nicely done. Learned a few things with things the first time I opened the book.
5,Excellent guide for the beginning kniiter,"I learned to knit and purl from one of the great women at my knitting group, but this book has carried me. I have used it often as a reference for a stitch or a term. I have recommended this to many as a great book to get a new knitter going. I still want to make the skull sweater for my sweetie. Thanks for the great book."
4,Knitters,"Likes the book when I first saw it, but once I got it I was a little confused on following the instructions and just getting started. Book overall was okay for me."
4,Great instruction!,"This is the first knitting book I bought and I definately don't regret it. The instructions for a beginning knitter are excellent. The patterns in the book aren't something that I am excited about, I'll probably only make a few of them. But this book is definately worth it if only for the instructions!"
5,I learned to knit with this book!,"As a first-time knitter, I found this to be one of very few books that didn't lead to frustration after chapter one. The author's intelligent humor and wit make this a great book to read even when you're not holding knitting needles. Not only does the book explain knitting basics in simple English, but there are helpful hints for continued success......knitting has become part of my LIFE because I read this book.....and I feel artistically liberated! It will always be on my coffee table as an invaluable reference manual (sprinkled with passages that make you proud to be a Knit & Bitcher)."
4,great beginner's guide!,"I'm completely retarded when it comes to following directions so I thought I'd never be able to teach myself to knit. But this book is fantastic. A very funny, easy to read guide to learning to knit. And the patterns in the book are so cute! It makes the task of learning to knit very approachable."
5,Great knitting book,This book gives excellent explanations about knitting tecniques that are easy to follow for beginners. Also it has patterns for beginners through advanced knitters.
2,"Cool looking patterns, but not accurate","When I opened this book, I loved the way the designs of the sweaters and other accessories. I was really sick of seeing out-of-style knitting books that only your grandma would wear in 1980. This book definitely has patterns that are for people more in tune with today's mod fashions. I was truly excited to get started on a few of these.However, the patterns were very inaccurate and difficult to follow. The measurements were inaccurate, and it really was hit or miss when it came to knitting a good pattern, especially since each pattern was written by a different person."
4,Pun Intended,"Stroller uses nearly every knitting pun imaginable, but it makes for a fun (but sometimes hokey) read. She covers a good deal of ground in her handbook, and the patterns provided definately back up the ""lessons"" in the book.I was surprised by her relatively quick address of Intarsia and Fair Isle, whilst excluding any mention of Entrelac.At times, I found the illustrations a bit unclear, but on the whole, I think this is a fun and focused primer for the beginning knitter -- as well as a great pattern source for the experienced. Stroller also highlights computer programs and internet options available to knitters.This would be a perfect gift (along with some yarn and needles) for that friend who wants to learn how to knit."
4,Another feminist knitter,"I've always been kind of a closet ""crafter""...having a PhD in mech eng, it was hard enough getting respect from the guys. The title is what originally caught my eye in the bookstore, and the cool patterns inside made me feel that knitting wasn't just for grandmas and the die-hard domestic types anymore. The illustrations of some of the techniques weren't always the easiest to follow, but I was able to pick it up in one weekend. I finished one of her hats and a basic scarf over the New Year break. I especially appreciated the sections that help out when things go wrong. I love the features about the pattern authors...such a diverse group of people! This book provided all the inspiration I needed to feel good about ,ok, being a woman and knitting, and more than enough technical information to keep me from getting discouraged."
3,YogaMama,"The sound quality was poor and should have been improved from its original state. The songs are awesome however! With a remake of the CD, I would purchase it again."
3,good,Very please with the outcome. Recieved the book in a timely fashion and in good condition as I expected
3,Reference check,Book is simple to use and well though out for content and examples. It can benefit from adding tags to make location of the examples easier.
3,Not like the 1st two,"The 1st two albums by Bebo Norman were gems. Ever since he has linked up with Ed Cash - it is like muzak to me. No deep strings and pulls on the heart strings. I am a great fan of the 1st two albums - ""Ten Thousand Days"" and ""Fabric of Verse."""
5,Great item for boys Halloween Costume!,"I just received this item in mail and it is perfect! My son wears 18-24months and it was sized 4-6boys I am going to have to take it in a little, but it won't take much to make it fit my son and he loves it, it is very soft and has 3 velcro pieces that hold it together, I plan on sewing it a little from the bottom half way up, that way it will stay on, I think he would break the velcro and it would come off too easily. But again it will serve it's purpose with a little help."
5,Best introduction to mindfulness available,"This book is not a how-to-meditate introduction, but rather a why-we-meditate introduction. It is a wonderful book by an amazing teacher--a kind and caring individual who has made a big difference in the Dharma world. This book might change your life--buy it!"
4,Good handy reference for TOAD users,"I don't use this book a lot, but have found it to be worthwhile. It's a good read when riding the bus because I can always pick up a tip or two."
4,Definitely Not for the Beginner,"Being new to TOAD, when I first glanced at the book without having the TOAD application opened, my eyes glazed over. After I set it aside and picked it up another time but have the TOAD application opened, the book was somewhat easy to follow. Too bad that there isn't a TOAD 101 (book or tutorial) out there."
5,Track Listing,"Here is the track listing for the box set, seeing as Amazon did not provide it:Disc 1: Losing My Religion, Stand (Live), Turn You Inside-Out (Live), World Leader Pretend (Live)Disc 2: Radio Song, You Are The Everything (Live), Orange Crush (Live), Belong (Live)Disc 3: Shiny Happy People, I Remember California (Live), Get Up (Live), Pop Song '89 (Live)Disc 4: Near Wild Heaven, Tom's Diner (Live), Low (Live), Endgame (Live)"
5,The Best Book Available on Email Marketing,"The Engaged Customer is, in my view, the best book available on email marketing. Hans Peter Brondmo is a top expert and he pours out his knowledge on every page. Even more, it is well written and keeps your interest."
4,Domestic violence Latino family,Excellent book if you are interested of the effects of domestic violence on the Latino family with their perspective.
4,Warm-up Act Takes First Honors,"In May, I ordered two books, Harry Potter and The Sugarbush. I read The Sugarbush, kind of as a warm-up to my summer reading. The author painted vivid pictures, took me into the rural community of the story and kept reeling me back to read more. The sentences were, at times, laborious and long; and, the descriptions were too deliberate (something I thought made it evident that the writer is ""green""). But, I rate a book based on whether I want to put it down and whether it takes me on an emotional or mental roller coaster ride. The Sugarbush did this for me. When Harry arrived, I eagerly began the book and found that I had to do all the work to engage in the book and my roller coaster ride was more like a caliope. The Sugarbush, as the ""warm-up"" act, took first honors."
4,The NASCAR 06: Total Team Control Review,"The Reason I rated NASCAR 06: Total Team Control 5 stars as the game fun, because this is the best game I've ever bought. Here are a few features:1. Car Swapping- When you crash, you get to swap cars with your teammate.2. Block- Now this is when somebody is coming up hot on your tail, also ther is an opponent trying to make a move right in front of you. If you have a teammate behind your rival, select the ""block"" command. When you select that command He'll keep that opponent behind you.3. Move- When a teammate is like blocking your path, select the ""move"" command. Your teammate will move over for you.4. Follow- When you want to draft with your teammate, select the ""follow"" command. That command means you want your teammate to ""FOLLOW"" you.I loved the game, you should too. Availaible in stores now from EA Sports for PS2 and XBOX."
3,It's okay.,"Well, this is a game that I think is not a very good game like Gran Turismo 4 and Need For Speed Underground 2. It is because the game play is kind of bad because as somebody mentions, the steering is not very good. So, it will a tough game to beat. I do agree with them. Second, the visual is kind of rough. Not very good but this is just slightly better. Also, for the sound effect, it is good but some improvement can be made like the team radio. Overall, this game I can say is only ""okay"". You can try it but you might regret it."
2,Very disappointed with steering,"The steering on Nascar 2006 is really awful. It's even more awful compared to the past two Nascar games. I just received the game today and tried to play it. I was really shocked at how I simply could not drive the car consistently. The steering is sluggish, but at the same time ""jerky"". I found it impossible to be smooth in the turns, or for that matter, be smooth on the straights trying to change lanes. The rest of the game changes seem really good, but if I can't drive the cars the other changes don't matter. I'm going to give the game away... it's that bad. I would suggest renting the game first. This is the first review I've ever written because I don't want others to make the same mistake I have made."
2,This was a dissapointment...,"The skits burned on this DVD are not very good. There are some classics, but not the very best."
5,So underrated -,"Gilda is one of the funniest women comedians that is seldom celebrated or appreciated anymore.In my opinion, only Tina Fey compares in today's SNL spotlight.RIP Mrs. Funny Face - you are missed!"
5,The Best of Gilda Radner,"This movie not only shows Gilda's rise to stardom at SNL through her famous characters, but gives you glimpses of her as a person. Her sweet personality and unique ""cooky manner "" made her one of a kind. I will never stop missing her."
5,Grey Gardens the movie,"I first watched the documentary, ""Grey Gardens"". By watching the documentary first, it gave a better understanding of the characters in the movie. Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lang are outstanding. They must have studied the documentary daily before filming."
5,almost spitting images of it!!!,Drew Barrymore lives way up to her family's name. i enjoyed it very much and it kept to the real story!.mike.s
5,Fantastic movie!,"After seeing the documentary several times on Netflix, this movie was just too cool. It brings everything together so you don't have to wonder how they ended up the way they did. And it is very true to life; if you Google Grey Gardens, you will find many, many sites that talk about the real lives of the Beales which ties with the movie to a ""T""!"
5,Truly a dysfunctional family..,"The actors did a very good job with this true story. Mom living in a fairy tale and refusing to face reality issues. A perfect example of ""letting your house go."" Also, sad to see the mother holding her daughter back from reaching her dreams! It held my attention to the end."
2,So grey it was bleak,"Great acting and interesting sets, but so terribly sad and depressing. The device of starting at the end and progressing the action through flashbacks helped add interest, but not enough to keep me watching for long."
5,"""Grey Gardens"" is a classic","I've seen ""Grey Gardens"" about 4 times,and I still want to see it again.I went to youtube to watch the Documentary,and was amazed how the film is true to life of Big and Little Edie,and the house.Drew Barrymore is superb.I've always been a fan of her movies,but ""Grey Gardens""has taken her acting to another playing field. Jessica Lange is unreal,she is Big Edie.Lange sings,dances,and ages 40 years.If ""Grey Gardens"" was on the big Screen,everyone would get an Oscar."
5,"Nothing ""grey"" about this movie!","I had seen the 2 documentaries, and was really skeptical and worried that the HBO movie would be a disappointment. I was so pleasantly surprised! The acting was impeccable. I had always thought that Drew Barrymore was more of a comic actress. I have a new respect for her after viewing this film. Of course, Jessica Lange is brilliant (as always) in every role she takes on. I highly recommend this movie. It will answer so many questions you have after watching the documentaries. You really get to know the women and their lives and what led up to them living in squalor. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
5,perfect acting,"Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore were perfectly cast, and they both pulled off the huge age changes that they needed to - since a lot of the movie was in flashbacks. They played VERY interesting women, and that also made the movie most enjoyable."
5,Great Help Book,I bought this book for my daughter who is in nursing school. She was having some difficulty with her A & P class as she has a professor who is extremely intelligent and went very fast in teaching. This book has made it easy to reference where they are and what she needs to know in simple terms. We have purchased several books in this series and are very pleased with them all.
5,alot of entertainment in one package,"I bought this package for the film ""in Harms Way"".The other 2 are just ok. goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye!!!!!"
5,Great John Wayne Adventures,This 3 pack is really great! Was a great bargain for all 3 films and they are excellent quality.Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys John Wayne.
3,We never get it out.,We've had it for 6 months and never got it out yet. Maybe we'll get brave someday.
1,"Avoid this DVD - Seek out ""A Rocumentary of the 1964 Tour"" instead","Don't bother with this DVD. Another DVD is available with the exact same content and much better quality.Seek out ""A Rocumentary of the 1964 Tour"" produced by Legacy Entertainment - LEDVD 5007, NTSC, Region 1. However, I was unable to find this DVD for sale through amazon.com, so you may have to look elsewhere.The content of that DVD is two programs - ""The Beatles Down Under"" which features interviews with fans and a lengthy interview with John, Paul, George and Jimmy Nichol. The other program, ""The Beatles On the Road"" is a more standard history of the band but still interesting.However, this DVD, just called ""The Beatles Down Under Plus On The Road"" is sub-par quality. It looks like a screen was filmed and transferred to DVD, and in the process, you see a border on all four sides of the image. In essence, the video image is shrunk. Plus the quality is worse than ""A Rocumentary"", even though the content is identical.Hope this helps."
1,POOR POOR QUALITY,I have seen all this footage in excellant quailty. This looks like it was dubbed down about 10 times. Don't waste your time or money.
4,Good as Any!!!,As a high school football coach. I am given a expense account and am able to purchase a few books every year. I would like to say that this book is as good as any I have read on the subject. The author does an excellent job of explaining the 4-3 position by position. It also show different defensive looks. This is a good book for a peewee or high school coach.
1,I didn't receive the product,"Although, I ordered the product twice, I always received the wrong product. Twice (June 4 and July 10) I ordered the SMALL one and in both opportunities I received the LARGE one that didn't fit with my shoes."
4,umm..okay,"I really didnt like Sal and Liz not being together, that whole fight on the bus was really stupid. Sal was acting so weird bout Lizs answer to that stupid truth or dare question. But I was glad to see Richard and Liz together. What was the deal with that Erin girl??? All in all, this wasnt so bad, but it wasnt my fav. SVJH that's 4 sure."
3,Good,"Two Days, Three Nights was pretty good. If you keep up with the series, I would reccommend that you read it. I've read the entire series so far and it's not my favorite, but it still has some turning points for the characters."
4,"Quality Stuff, But...","I simply didn't laugh out loud (except for ""Little Chocolate Donuts."") Everyone should RENT this, but must OWN ""The Blues Brothers."" Belushi on SNL was monumental in establishing some out-there American humor, but this collection has nothing on Monty Python. I think early SNL was more about the excitement of being a late-night show with funny people rather than actually being chock full of 'knock-you-outta-your seat' laughs. I see this more as a blueprint for what he did in 'Blues Brothers'--every single nuance he gave in that movie was sheer brilliance--rather than itself being the definitive John Belushi."
4,Please give us COMPLETE rather than BEST,"Yes, this is a funny DVD and John Belushi really was an amazing character with both comic antics (eye brows!), mannerisms (H & L BROCK Tax Consultant with reason#3, ""We lie for you...) and musical performances (Joe Cocker!!!!). However, consumers want the COMPLETE skits rather than what someone judges to be the BEST skits. Even if all seasons of SNL are released, the COMPLETE skits would sell as many of his comedic performances touched so many people in different ways. One Flew Over the Hornets Nest...... butter, butter with Raquel Welch as the infamous Nurse."
4,WRONG COVER ART Still funny after all these years yes missing bits,"I knew I would like the DVD. And, I did.Sure, there are sketches that are missing. But, some great ones are here.We could have used more Blues Brothers, Samurai, Weekend Update, Restaurant, etc.Only 1 Blues Brothers & Restaurant. 2 Weekend Update ""But NO"", 2 famous Samurai bits.1 Bee sketch because all of us fans know he did NOT like the Bee sketches.The DVD is very good, but not perfect due to missing sketches."
2,No passing game,"Many of the other reviews posted seem to be talking about madden for the next gen systems. But for Gameboy advance it just doesnt hold up. The game for the GBA is annoyingly tough. Your passing game is almost non existent as the worst defenses in the nfl jump in front of, and intercept numerous pass attempts. The running game is grounded and easier than that of the gamecube version, but thats not gonna help much if your in a situation where you need points fast, or must throw the ball. On madden for the gamecube I love to pass the ball, playing the gba version is frustrating, as you watch your offense get ripped to shreds, and your defense give up play after play."
1,Booooorrring!,This is not what I am used to from Fourplay. This is garbage. It almost sounds like elevator music.
2,Worse Fourplay Cd I've Heard,this was something slapped together just to keep their name out in the Smooth Jazz Genre..Guy's I know you can do waaaaayy better than this garbage ..
4,the rise and fall of academic drifting versus the Academic Rise of Falling Drifters,"The CD mentioned for sale is not Giardini Di Miro's The Rise and Fall of Academic Drifting... Rather it is the same tracklist - in identical order - by groups such as STYROFOAM, DNTEL, HERRMANN & KLEINE, NITRADA, OPIATE, ISAN and TURNER.It is a much more electronic feel -Giardini's Album on Homesleep is magnificent and a more organic production... that would probably appeal to fans of the constellation records label... or even 4AD label...The Hermann + Klein / soundscapey version is also very cool... it's well done... but it is very different from the original Di Miro album...Pet Life Saver is a very powerful track with vocals... a very moving piece.anyway, hope this ""review"" clears up any confusion about the two albums and the contrast between them-G"
3,One Star for Each Year It Lasted,"After just three years this perfectly good phone has started going bad. One hand set no longer rings. When I hear the phone ringing elsewhere and I pick up on this handset, it doesn't connect, the other phones keep ringing and the call goes to voicemail. I used and liked all the features on it, but there were also a couple of things I felt were lacking. When you've been out and missed calls, the display tells you how many, but it will no longer display the date and time until you clear these calls. Also, clearing the calls on one handset, doesn't clear them on the others. When you're listening to messages through the handset rather than at the recording base, you can't delete messages. The things I like best about it were the intercom feature, the headset capability, and the battery life. I would have been happy to keep this phone for many years more, if only it had lasted that long!"
1,Wow!,We purchased these handsets after reading the reviews proclaiming their extensive range. Wow--what a disappointment. The range of our handsets does not match the performance of a corded rotary-dial unit circa 1990.
4,Pretty good phones,"I've had this phone system in service for about 3-weeks. I gave it an overall rating of 4 stars because of two (for my use) significant shortcomings.There a several excellent features which include ringtone's and ring-melodies. Each instrument can have it's own distinctive ""ring"" - or none. The best feature is that you only need to program one phone, and copy all, or selective telephone numbers to the other phones. Very impressive. The clarity of conversations is also excellent, but the volume is limited in both the answering system and hands-free functions. The volume cannot be raised to a comfortable listening level in either of these functions.The other shortcoming is that there is no audible alert for new messages on the answering system. There is a average brightness LED that flashes when a new message has been recorded, but that LED is not really noticeable in common ambient room lighting."
4,Very good phone,"We ordered this phone after using the older version for at least 5 years. It works very well and I am very satisfied. The only thing I wish it had that the older version had was a caller ID that also ""spoke"" who was calling."
1,Dissapointed with the product,I bought this product because someone raved that the charge lasted a long time. I bought the system only 2 weeks ago and the phones get discharged after a couple of phone calls ( not eve a couple of hours). So I keep moving the hand set so that I have the properly charged one always available. When you buy this stuff online it is so difficult to deal with returns and it only adds to the cost by having to pay to ship it back.
1,Panasonic kx-tg1033s answering system,I am disappointed in the product. It makes my phone line shut down. Since the 30 period was 1 day away I called panasonic directly. I sent it back to them to see what was wrong. If I opened the box and used the product and it was caausing this problem could I have sent it back to you for a refund? I was afraid to try. Please let me know Sue kidney
2,not reliable - look elsewhere,"When I first got these, I went through the charging procedure, and one of the phone exhausted it's battery WAY faster than it should have, so I called Panasonic, and they wanted me to go through some cumbersome multi day rigamarole, so I gave up in frustration, figuring, ok, so I only get 2 days on standby, not the 7 as advertized, anyway, withing a couple of months that one stopped working. Now one of the others is on the fritz, sometimes it works fine and others there is no display. Audio quality is ok, range is pretty limited - maybe 50 or 60 feet max. I wish I could find a quality cordless phone system for a reasonable price - whatever, this one is not it. keep shopping."
4,So far So good!,"My best friend has this phone and recomended it. I love that the battery is two regular rechargeable AAA batteries, so if they die I can just use the ones I have at home instead of buying expensive batteries! I walked outside using the phone yesterday and it was still crystal clear. I have had this phone about a month now, I had a very bad cordless before this and when I switched people noticed a difference. They commented that they could now hear me and I was much clearer. The bases feel very cheap and light, but no issues with quality. I love that each handset has speaker phones. My in-law's cordless set is unable to have both phones in use, you must transfer the call to other headsets... but this system is not so..THANK GOODNESS! Over all I'm very happy so far. I paid just over $70 and that was with free super saver shipping. Amazon said it would take 8 days... I got it in 3!"
3,Pretty well satisfied,"Our old phone system had a seperate mail box feature (one for my husband and one for myself) that this one does not have. I didn't realize how much I would miss that feature. Our phone number is the same as our fax number, so it seems I have to turn the answering feature off, to receive a fax-still working on that. The only reason I got rid of the old phone system is that pressing the numbers to dail out was not reliable. #1 on one phone quit working, and #8 on another phone did the same thing. They would have to be returned to Canada at our expense for diagnosis. So that was a factor in choosing the new system."
2,"Have to return it due to echo, unfortunately.","For the most part I've liked this phone for the 6 weeks we've had it. Initially calls were very clear and it has a good range away from the house. But after a few weeks I would occasionally have a call with a very noticeable echo or reverb sound, and unfortunately now it's happening on most calls. It's really distracting and just not tolerable for us, so the phone is going back. Should also mention that one day the caller ID on my handset just wasn't working; it would say ""incoming call"" but never display the caller ID, though the other handsets were. Next day it worked fine. Still waiting to hear from the seller, but if they don't honor it then I assume (hope!) Amazon will."
4,Panasonic cordless phone set,We are very happy with the Panasonic phone set KX-TG1031. Very easy to set up and use. So far the battery strength is fantastic. We talk sometimes for over an hour on two phones to a relative in Europe and the phones do not die on us like the last set we had. Our only issue is with the shape of the phone...impossible to hold with your shoulder when you need both hands to do something. May need to get a earpiece adapter. Any suggestions?
2,Could be better,"I purchased this phone set in December 08. By June it wasn't working properly. I called the Panasonic customer service and they were rude and useless. Thank God for Amazon. They stand behind the products they sell. I was able to send the phone back and received a brand new one at no cost, not even shipping. The problem with the phone is that it doesn't have a long range. You can't even move 30 feet away from the base. I had older technology phones that worked better. Will look for a different brand for my next purchase. But I definitely will buy it through Amazon."
3,nothing special,"buttons stick causing one to dial three 1's instead of one. good speaker though. Did my research and this model was highly rated, my experience was a bit different than the reviewers"
1,A piece of junk,"The voice on the income call breaking up all the time. I sent the phone back for exchange. They sent me an older one, and the voice still breaking up."
4,GREAT PHONES!,VERY HAPPY WITH THESE PANASONIC PHONES. THEY'D BEEN RECOMMENDED BY SEVERAL FRIENDS BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL WE ABSOLUTELY NEEDED REPLACEMENTS DID WE FINALLY GET THEM. COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. AND THE PRICE WAS FANTASTIC FOR THE QUALITY.
3,Ok but not great,"I purchased this cordless phone with answer machine to replace an older AT&T equivalent. Unfortunately, some of the same problems with AT&T were repeated. The range is just outside of the house. Impossible to carry into the garden and use the phone. In addition, the handset display is poorly lighted and difficult to read. The features are equivalent to the older model but no real gain in new features or even simplification. Sound is ok but not great."
2,Buy something else,"Most corded phones have more range than the Panasonic DECT 6.0. If I plan to wander more than about 20 feet from the base, I reach for one of my other cordless phones. Obviously, I'm very disappointed."
2,Disappointed,I went looking for a phone that was comfortable to hold and one that had big enough buttons to be comfortable for my husband to use. I saw this set at a local store and was happy to find it cheaper on Amazon. The problem is that the sound quality of the phone is lacking. Even being within 15 ft of the base we get significant static-enough to interfere with a conversation-and even with the volume turned up all of the way they are not always loud enough (and my hearing is fine). I will be looking for a replacement phone system.
1,playback of messages already faulty,can't even understand the message playback. I've had this phone for 2 months. Great.
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0,"Good: Any phone can be used for most functions and the system keeps track on all phones. Clear Reception. Phone book can be transfered from one phone to another. Works better than my old phone, another brand.Bad: Slow response when using menu. Somewhat confusing menu items. Needs direct access to redial and caller id. NO MENU! My old (and still using it) Panasonic doesn't require fumbling thru a menu.I've read that some static with a lot of electronics. None that I can tell. Using 3 different cordless phones, wireless router, half a dozen remotes, wireless this and that, no problem."
5,Excellent Phone!,I replaced an older Panasonic phone system only because it was getting old and the battery was beginning to lose its ability to hold a charge (I had already replace the battery once a few years ago). I am extremely happy with the new Panasonic phone system. It's a great value and a great product.
1,Returned to Amazon,"I must agree with several other's who have rated this 1 or 2 stars. Thanks to Amazon for accepting this return after the normal 30 day window.PROS: Good clarity while using Comcast voice over IP.CONS: Low battery life. Getting less than 10-12 hours before needing charging.CONS: 8 out of 10 time the phones cannot ""link with base"" and will not ring. We can hear the Base unit ringing, but the hand-sets do nothing, even if right next to the base.We are returning these and looking for new ones."
2,Nice phone VERY BAD BATTERY LIFE,"I've had this phone less than 6 months and prior to this another Panasonic which worked just fine.While these phones are nice all of them fail if you talk more than 30 to 45 minutes, not that I do that very often. and I try to keep them charged all of the time. They then need to be recharged before you can use them again. Panasonic has acknowledged that it is a battery problem and wants me to mail them in so they can repair, which is nice. But what do you do for telephones while they are gone for a month or more.I really expected them to work correctly and not need repairs this soon"
3,Extremely short range....,"The phone is perfect, except for the lack of signal strength.No matter WHAT I do, I can't get a single bar on the signal strength indicator... The phone has the usual indicator that most cell phones have which indicates aprox. how much signal strength there is. Well, I get no bars at all. It doesn't matter how far the phone is from the base, or where the base is located in my apartment... Yes, even if I am standing right next to the base with all 3 phones fully charged, none of them get a single bar strength. I've tried everything, tomorrow I am calling Panasonic service to see what's going on, maybe I got a bad base."
4,Nice phone system for the money.,"I was very pleased with this purchase. I do have one complaint, I wish the volume could go a little higher. My husband and I have turned the volume up as high as it would go, but still not as loud as we would like it. Other than that, the phone system is really nice and a great value for the money."
2,Short range phone,"I've always had Panasonic phones and in general they've been sturdy and made well. This tri-portable phone set is very light weight but has all the basic functions as described. However, other than the main station the remaining two chargers are so light and flimsy as to easily fall off a night table. That's not such a big deal but I wish the bases were weighted down in some way. In any event my only serious concern is the severe distance restriction these phones seem to have. One phone is in my home office right next to the front door yet I cannot take the portable handset more than ten feet out the front door! (My old portable phone worked to the end of the driveway.) In fact, there have been a few times when I have had no signal at all between the base and the handset right at my desk -- a distance of 2.5 ft.! Therefore, I would not recommend this phone as apparently any distance can be a problem."
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0 3 handset cordless answering and phone system,"Decent phone system. Clarity of sound and range of phones very good. Only bad thing I have found so far is that the base system does not let you know how many new/old messages are on the recorder. Also, if there are old messages still on the recorder there is no indication on the base either. Would recommend this system."
4,Very easy to set up,"This set is very to use, just take it out of the box, plug it in to charge the phone, put in a phone line and go. No programming of the handsets is required. Only neg. is menu system is kind of complex. Very good phone system."
2,Sound drop offs!,"When the sound is not ""dropping off"" and you hear nothing, the sound quality is great. We are working with Panasonic -their customer service people are helpful, retuning the package for a ""refurbished set"" - does annoy me that while it is only a month old, we get ""refurbished."" Negative of the handsets, is that each one is independent - previous multiple handset phone we had if you cleared on handset (missed calls, etc), all were cleared."
4,A liitle more volume...,"I'm using this phone system with MagicJack (check this out), and the phone works just fine. Tons of good features. The only suggestion I would have is that there be a little more volume. I have the phone set on max and it is JUST passable."
4,Another good Panasonic phone,"I have had great success with Panasonic phones -- corded and cordless. This one is no different.It's well made, easy to use, has a good feel, plenty of useful features and calls sound perfect, as good as any phone and answering machine I've owned.The only things I'd change to make this set better: Make it also available in black and add a ""copy to all handsets"" phonebook update option. (You can share phonebook updates between all handsets but you have to send from one handset to each other handset one at a time.) But those things are nits in the big picture."
4,Fit the Need,"This phone set fit the need for a static free solution to wireless phones in our home. We had over two years of constant static on several 5.8 ghz models we tried. We blamed our cable provider for not providing static free service, but every time they checked the lines they were fine. Then we found out that many wireless devices in the neighborhood with the same frequency could be the problem, and the DECT 6.0 technology might be an answer. It was, and phone reception is great. This set is a good value. The only minor negative point about this Panasonic set is how the base station mounts to the wall. It just kinda hangs out there, like it doesn't fit; but I guess we can live with that odd feature to have solved our problem. This was a good buy for us."
2,No audible recorder beep,This is a nice telephone except...... when someone leaves a recorded message the only way you know it is by a small flashing light there is no audible recorder beep. We had this phone for nine months but were just missing to many calls. So I went on line to the manufactures web sites and started downloading their operating manuals on telephones that I was interested in. I recommend the Uniden DECT2085-3 Dect 6.0. which I find is a much much better phone.
5,What did you say??,"""What did you say??"" I wish I had a dollar for every time I've had a person on the phone that said that to me. Talking to my parents, who live out of state, was very difficult. I always had to yell into the phones I've tried before. Not with these Panasonic DECT 6.0 phones. I'm very happy with them and the features they have. The only weird thing is when on the phone, I don't hear my own voice coming through the speaker. I'm not used to that. When I first got them, I found myself asking, ""Can you hear me alright?"", just to make sure. My mother and father can hear me perfectly now and so can everyone else. I know there have been a few bad reviews on this phone but from me, nothing but praise. Maybe those folks just got 'lemons' or maybe they're hyper-critical... I don't know. I DO know I really like these phones!"
2,Constantly cutting out,We've been having problems with the phone(s) cutting out. We can hear the other parties but they can't hear us. It's not due to being too far away from the bases either. We'll be within 10 feet of the base the whole time. There will be good connection for 5 - 10 minutes and then it will cut out. It comes back after about 10 - 15 seconds; just when you're ready to hang it up as a dropped called. We do have great clarity hearing others when it's working though. Everything worked for about two months before the trouble started. I have received complaints that I can hardly be heard when using the matched Pansonic headsets too.With all the Christmas calls today it just became too much to sit by and not do anything about it. It's too late to return it to Amazon (3 months). I guess my next step is to see what Panasonic will do about it.
2,Very Disappointed,"This phone was intended as a replacement and upgrade for an ATT E5965C (which lost the ability to hold a charge in all of the handsets after three years, even with new batteries). I consider this Panasonic to be a downgrade, not an upgrade, and I am very disappointed. Compared to the ATT, which had a color display, this display is extremely hard to see. It does not have customized ringtones or graphics. The handset does not flash when the phone rings (so if you have more than one line you can't tell which one is ringing). I don't notice any improvement in sound quality with the new DECT technology. You can't tell if someone else is using the line by looking at a handset; the ATT displayed ""extension in use."""
2,Don't drop this bottle!,"The second day I had this bottle I dropped it. It hit on the rubber base and dentled the bottle so badly that it tips over when I place it on a table. Now it is worthless. Not the quality I expect of a Swiss company, even if the bottle is made in China. I give it 2 stars because it did have style."
4,Great thermal but scratches easily,"This thermal works incredibly well. It even keeps ice from melting for hours and hours. The lid is very tight and will not leak, and as long as you are careful, your beverage will not drip onto you (and burn you) when you unscrew the lid. The thermal doesn't have a handle or a ring to hold on to, but the outside will not hurt your hand, cold or hot.A definite negative is that though the bottle maintains its shine and looks wonderful, it does scratch very easily and is pretty easy to dent. This doesn't hurt the function of the thermal, but you'd have to be careful if you are one of those who likes their possessions to look great all the time."
2,thermal bottle,"Thought it was a water travel mug. I should have read the reviews before purchasing. It's just a thermos and doesn't hold very much. I can, however, put ice in it and take it to work for ice water but I have to keep refilling it (several times). Not worth the money for what I wanted it for."
2,"Leaky, design doesn't make sense","This product has a fatal flaw which causes it to leak your beverage.SIGG touts its ""2nd lid,"" which is basically an upper chamber (grey plastic part) that has two tiny holes which allow steam to rise into the that chamber. The problem is, once your coffee steam rises up, it then cools and condenses into a big puddle of coffee, and then leaks its way out of the upper lid (small metal top part).Am I the only one who sees this? This thing leaked all over my bag. The upper chamber is not sealed against leaks (the lower main bottle portion seals just fine).I can't return it now, so I'm going to seal up those two tiny holes to prevent liquids from getting into the upper chamber.Disappointing, that the feature they trumpet about (upper chamber has relief holes to prevent vacuum sealing of the bottom) is the one that kills this product."
2,Substandard and contrived,"I could hardly wait for this muddled tale to end. Julie Campbell Tatham, writing as ""Julie Campbell,"" wrote the first six books of the series, and this, the fifth, stumbles. The scenes where Trixie tries to convince her family and friends that she's ""in love"" to achieve a noble secret agenda, were embarrassing and unnecessary -- she could have achieved the same end by straightforwardly confiding in her parents. And the ""mystery"" turns out to be a disappointing non-mystery.I recommend this book strictly to continuity fans who want to know every detail of the development of the Bob-Whites of the Glen club; otherwise, skip to the Mystery in Arizona for a believable story and entertaining (rather than ridiculous) style."
4,helpful summary of secured transactions/article 9,"I used this for my secured transactions class in law school. It helped to clarify some of the rules related to perfection, etc. Now I use it as a reference book for when random Article 9 questions arise in my practice. It gives good example and explanations (hence the title) and is easy to read and understand, especially if you have some basic knowledge in the subject, but even if you don't. I have used several of the Example and Explanations series books while in law school and found them to be very helpful."
1,Unspiritual People,"How about calling this release ""Reverend Moon's Greatest Hits""? Speech's cd is heavy-handed, to be sure, just like the abusive and damaging International Church of Christ that Speech belongs to, who think people in their group are the only true christians, who allow their members to only marry other members in the group, and who call and harrass their members every week if they haven't given their weekly financial ""contribution"". Arrogant and self-righteous are his lyrics-- and as far away from representing ""spiritual people"" as are the day-to-day practices of Speech and the International Churches of Christ."
5,"So far, so fabulous!","I am a huge fan. I just received Blue Lizard a few days ago and LOVE IT! I have extremely dry skin, especially in the winter; the skin on my hands cracks and bleeds - I basically lose my protective barrier. Despite Rx creams from my Dermatologist, I still get no relief. My heels are always dry, cracked and scaly no matter the season. For the past few nights before I climbed into bed, I applied Blue Lizard to my heels and then put socks on. What a difference! Within just a few days, the skin on my heels is actually soft and the scaling has disappeared. I am just thrilled and can't wait to try it on my hands next fall/winter. I think it's going to by my saving grace!!! Highly recommended. PS - there is an ever so slight scent to the cream but nothing at all offensive."
5,Toddler Birthday Part Game,"We ordered the ELMO party game for my daughter's second birthday party and it was perfect. Elmo's nose stickers are a perfect size for little fingers and we were able to remove and re-use the stickers so the kids could try to pin-the-nose-on-elmo again and again. The game does not come with a blind-fold, so be prepared with a solution."
4,Food for thought,"I found this book to be very thoughtful, and after reading it , I just wonder how many more lies we will be given. It shows how easily the common person can be fooled."
3,Book condition.....,"I said it is ok because I have not had a chance to read it yet. However, the book was in great condition when I received it."
5,The Vegetable Bible,"The Vegetable Bible came quickly, I purchased a used one and it is in great shape.The book is colorful with many pictures and examples, answering many of my questions on how to prepare many vegetables. I am very pleased and will enjoy this book for many years to come.It would make a great gift."
1,worse than airline food,"I actually received this gift. half of it was inedible (processed brie cheese? seriously?) and the rest was a low-quality product in fancy packaging (honey-roasted peanuts?). it is totally absurd to pay $50, let alone $20. if this had been the package of food you paid $5 for as an ""in-flight meal"" i'd have been disappointed. you could do *much* better at whole foods with a $20 bill."
3,Very good photos and insight into Tibet and its lost culture by the the other man who escaped to Tibet with Heinrich Harrer,"Finally, the personal notes, sketches and photos of the other man who escaped to Tibet with Heinrich Harrer were published in 2002. The writing is a bit rough around the edges and not polished because, well, eh, they were published 29 years after his death. As is told in the Seven Years in Tibet movie, Harrer and Aufschnaiter lived apart for their years in Lhasa.This book details Peter's stay in Lhasa and his travels around Tibet, until leaving in 1952. It is illustrated with over 130 photos, about half in colour. Many of the colour photos were taken in 1981. This is a great companion to Harrer's books detailing a lost era in Tibet's history. It includes a large and faithful reproduction of the Lhasa map Aufschnaiter made for the Tibetan Government.I liked this book for the photos and the insight into Tibet and its lost culture."
2,"Impressive Legal Lady, Lacking Legal Prose","O'Connor writes with her usual clarity and simplicity, which makes her thoughts and theories very easy to follow. The prose is not especially moving, but Supreme Court Justices are chosen for the quality of their reasoning and not for their artistic or literary talents.Lawyers, judges, and law grads will find large chunks of this book to be basic rehashes of things that were pounded into their skulls over three years of con law, civ pro, and so on. But it is still interesting to see what a Supreme Court Justice picks as the noteworthy events and aspects of our justice system. It would have been nice to have more of O'Connor's views and analysis instead of historical fact presented with little or no comment. Presumably this was done to make the discussion more accessible to lay people.Mildly interesting, but overall disappointing for a reader already familiar with the US court system."
4,I enjoyed this book,"Actually I have the CD version. I enjoyed ""reading"" this book. But I have to admit I am a Constitution semi-nerd, and enjoy learning details of the founding fathers and previous court cases."
3,I'm not sure how to describe this book.,"It is part memoir, part civics lesson, and part history book. But in the end it really is none of these. It was a pleasant enough read, but not very enlightening. The best part of the books were Justiuce O'Connor'spresentation of woman's history (I wish I knew more about this) and her reminisces of Thurgood Marshall."
2,Wordy snoozer,"The book reads like a garden variety history book, with few insights strictly pertaining to O'Connor's own experiences. It doesn't feel the least bit candid, which is disappointing, and the writing style is windy and bloated.Seriously, was she getting paid by the word? Some of the sentences and paragraphs in the book remind me of my Business Communications class exercises where you are asked to re-write for improved clarity.O'Connor does bring up some truly interesting points, like how the legal language on Fourth Amendment Search and Seizures was initially uncontentious, and that all the litigation surrounding it cropped up later. Ditto for 1st Amendment free speech stuff. Unfortunately, you have to slog through a lot of blah blah to get to the good stuff."
2,Well written but dry,"I read a lot of biography and I have tremendous respect for Sandra Day O'Connor. I thought, for sure, this was a win-win combination for this book. Sadly, I only made it three quarters through before I donated it to the local library. It is well written but dry."
1,Disappointing,"The author is very sloppy with details, dates, vehicles, events are not consistent - she needs an editor!The husband David claims to be a Christian and wants to do what the Lord wants, but he's sneaking around talking to his ex-mistress, he never tells the full truth to his wife, he never apologizes when first revealing his adultery or at the end.This is supposed to be a Christian family but David never prayed once, he didn't try to bring healing to his wife for the pain he caused, he never admitted he was wrong and was prideful and he never confessed to God or his wife his adultery.This story teaches that women must make the first move, take all the steps to reconcilliation and make all the sacrifices in an relationship - while allowing men to be jerks.The author obviously knows nothing about marriage problems and this book that could have taught the true meaning of healing a marriage - instead disappoints..."
4,More Sweet Tea,"The book was not what I expected but I did enjoy it. Being from the South, there were some good recipes inspired by the vingettes in the book. Therefore, I kept the book on my Kindle. I usually delete books after I read them."
5,The best addition to my place,I got this for my front room. It separates the shoe racks and the room so it looks less messy. This looks great on both side. I had lots of complement for this. Recommend this to anyone!
5,HAUNTING REMIXES -AN EXCELLENT NEW VERSION OF A CLASSIC SONG,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE these remixes ..Deep Dish kept the bassline (the most integral part of the original recording) and amped up the keys and drum machine ..the result is PURE BLISS .. the feather in their cap also being that they got Stevie to re-record her vocals as well ! You will def lose yourself in any one of these remixes ..get in the car roll down the windows and turn up the volume .. very danceable track with new breaks, new vocals, new arrangements.. you cannot help singing along or hitting that dance floor. Deep Dish delivers the goods on these remixes, if youre a fan of Nicks herself or both artists altogether, this song and these remixes are for you ..I could dance to this song all nite !"
3,"Music Good, Vocal Dull","Bass-driven punkadelica, let down by repetitious vocal performance. John Lydon, in much the same territory, manages something 10 times more vibrant. Or maybe he (Liar#1) just needs to stand closer to the mike and yell less. See We Regazzi\Make Up instead. The music is great though."
2,Disappointing Parker,"As an afficionado of Parker/Spencer books this is a disappointing effort.Halfway through, I was glutted with bullets,Winchesters,Colts, the way Wyatt holds his coffee cup,fried bread and bacon, etc.Parker has an obsession with Jewish women. Josie is Susan minus 100 or so years. ""Intelligent,upper class, educated, eating sparingly."" I missed Pearl, the wonder dog.Please, Robert, stick to what you do so well."
2,Pishposh and bleh,"What did Parker do here for source material? Watch Costner's ""Wyatt Earp""? Throw in a little ""Tombstone""? Buy into the myth Wyatt's ""Josie"" created for herself...and this is the woman (real name Sarah but who hid her Jewishness behind the name Josie) who gambled all his money away for over 45 years and then let him die of neglect. I loved the spotlight review from back in 2001, that bit of delicious parody up there - spot on, matey. In a few easy lines of perfect dialogue it captures the scope and style of this rather unimpressive book. Doc Holliday is intro'd as a southerner merely by saying he's a southerner...and then proceeds to speak in a coarse uneducated way from then on. Pooey on this book. Daniel P. Smith who wrote the spotlight review would have written a much better book. Probably has."
3,rhapsody,not up to parr for parker too much foul language for me story a little lame. I am buying his next book comming out soon.
4,TinHorn,"Whoah, boys, easy. Amazing how some people go off. Let's make that amusing. If you like westerns, Wyatt Earp, OK Corral, Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringgold (Ringo), and Josie Marcus (Dana Delany - hard to forget her face after the Tombstone movie), you're apt to appreciate this book. Excellent dialogue! Fine western!"
1,Gunmans Rhapsody,"Being a great fan of Parker I am Dismayed by this mail it in writing.There are fifty great books set in the old West,This is not one of them.Proves people should stick to what they know.Wheres Spencer"
4,parker is always a good read,"One thing you can count on Robert Parker always delivers a solid-well plotted mystery. He's the closest writer out there to the master, Raymond Chandler. Other recommended reads ""Bitterroot"" by James Lee Burke and ""Murder Doesn't Figure"" by Fred Yorg."
2,no pictures,"The pictures, that I hear are great in the paper addition, are missing from the electronic edition. Amazon should let you know what is included when making an electronic purchase. It is simply not fair to leave important thing out of a book and not let the buyer know easily and implicitly upon purchase."
3,A valentine,"This exhaustively researched book is very kind and extremely flattering to JBKO. So much so that is strained credibility. While the writer's approach is refreshing when compared to the hatchet jobs that have appeared over the years (one ludricous book even accuses Jackie of being an accomplice to JFK's murder!), it lacks the objectivity that a good biographer would bring to his subject. Still, I enjoyed the time I spent reading about this gallant lady."
1,Shame on Mickey Deans,"When Judy died Mr. Deans either would not or could not pay for her funeral and burial. Poor Judy laid in a temporary grave that funeral homes have for almost a year unknown to family & friends before daughter Liza had her mother properly married. What a lame excuse for a man. A shame, Judy could have done much better."
5,cord,"i live in small town and they charge a arm and leg for anything,like the price and life time warenty"
3,Causes annoying hum,"I use my PS2 these days primarily as a media player. Specifically, I use a little piece of homebrew software to play videos in .avi format of a usb hard drive. Ordered this because the cable I had before introduced an annoying hum into the audio signal. This one is slightly better, but the hum is still there. The hum becomes worse when bright images are projected onto the screen, so I think it's safe to assume that the video signal is crossing over into the audio channel, possibly because of inadequate shielding or a crappy connector. This cable's connector is plastic by the way, never a great indication of quality. However, the cable was four dollars; for that price one does not expect top quality. So if you are in need of a cable and a little hum doesn't bother you, then go for it."
4,Low price option,"I still use my Playstation 2 slim periodically and sometimes other people in my place will need to use the TV that is hooked up to the PS2. Rather than continually hooking and unhooking all the wires, I decided to buy an extra AV cable so I could just unplug the PS2 and bring it to another room.I looked at the options out there and gave this cable a try. I inspected the item once it arrived and just as I expected, the material felt cheap and flimsy. But when I used it to hook up my PS2, it worked like a dandy. Be careful when you plug it onto your PS2 since the fit is not too secure. This is a good choice since it does work and comes at a budget price."
2,it works,"I had broken my previous cord and replaced it. My Ps2 is as it was when I bought it,now I'm gaming again."
3,Nothing too special here..,"Decent enough artwork but the story was found wanting in my opinion. In truth, I felt that the characters remained a little too flat to make this one interesting. Batman is the surly guy who gets underestimated, Superman is the self-righteous one who is taken down surprisingly easily, Martian Manhunter is of dubious loyalty, and Aquaman is arrogant and out of touch but finally comes around just in the nick of time. I was really hoping for something with a little more depth where I felt that at least one of the memebers of JLA had changed from the beginning of the book. All in all it isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good either."
5,Katharine Hepburn's Hollywood Debut - A Gem,"The truest actor she has to play against is Barrymore - and she triumphs against his drunkardness and sexual advences. She even brings out of him a touching performance! But despite a very strong supporting cast, thisis Kate'film: from stepping down an impossibly long aristochratic star to laying casually and free in front of a fire.Hollywood might have trouble dealing with the East Coast Queen of Cool - but when they truly understood it was in her civilized nature, there just was no stopping her - 4 Award Winning Academy Awards in a Leading Role (and stilling count)!)"
1,"Justin P. Miller Place, NY","The book I read was called Jocks and Socks by Jim Ksicinski and Tom Flaherty. It is about what goes on in baseball lockerooms told by former players like Hank Aaron and other former baseball players.The book had some interesting things in it like how black player's back in the 60s 70s even the 80s were discriminated by teammates and coaches. Other things that happened in the lockerooms were that teammates sometimes beat up another teammate for costing them the game and what some coaches said to the players after they lost a game. The rest of the things that went on in this book you will just have to read and find out yourself.The book was very interesting I learned a lot of information about what goes on in lockerooms of baseball players. The players were treated horrible when discriminated, it was horrible about some of the things that happened to them and the world would definitely be better without it."
1,Boring,"Very boring. I might have laughed once or twice, it just wasn't funny. Fast forwarded in the hopes of the movie picking up but it was just more of the same."
3,Whore Love in Paris,"A sweet story of money, sex, lust and simply copulating while professional [...] of Italian descent felt in love with an average middle-aged clerk in Paris."
5,This book is beyond helpful...,"When I read Dying to Get Well, I was struck by the genuine tone of the book. The author is not attempting to ""sell"" anything to her readers.However,she is offering a wealth of information on taking ones health into ones own hands.The positive tone of the book, and the emphasis on living, or raw foods being a primary key to health, is so valuable to any reader seeking a wholistic approach to their health. While detailed ""instuctions"" for renewed health are provided, they are offered in such a way that the reader can follow their own instincts while applying them."
5,Strauss delivers again!!!,Neil has written another gem. Informative for both men and women and VERY entertaining.
5,"Style, you da man",What can I say? Style is the man. He's the proof that what we are all trying to do is worth it. He exceeded most of our own expectations. He's the motivation. This book validated everything I'm trying to do and it made me feel like anything was possible. It's a great big world out there. Go get it!
