1,There are better books out there,"Out of the 100+ investment-related books out there that I've read, this might rank last."
1,disappointing,"The images are very nice and well photographed, however as a work of scholarship it is flawed. There are a large number of datelines that are so clearly wrong as to question the authors expertise. I won't bore you with a image by image critique but suffice to say that there are better books on the market such as Friends of the House or Kai Yin Lo's book on Vernacular furniture all of which are real works of quality. As for the price guides included in the book, how helpful is it to give a ...[broad] price range... for a piece of furniture without explaining why one will be the lower price the other the more expensive."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! ALMOST STRANGLED MY CAT!!!!,"Lupine Cat Collars almost KILLED my cats! When they start to fray they tighten on the cats neck, therefore, CHOKING THEM! I DO NOT WANT A ""LIFETIME REPLACEMENT GUARENTEE""!!! I WANT A REFUND & FOR THESE COLLARS TO BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET!!!If you have Lupine collars on your cats, please check them EVERY SINGLE DAY! I have always been in the habit of checking my cats collars daily (since they are breakaway & I want to be sure my cats have proper id on even though they are strictly indoor cats). The fraying & choking of my cat happened in 1 Day. I'd hate to think what would have happened if I didn't check their collars everyday.Please use caution with these collars. Better yet, DO NOT EVEN BUY THEM!"
1,Don't bother...,This 'Unauthorized Biography' is just a rehash of the 'Authorized Interviews' of KISS that have been around for the last 25 years with NO new insights or information at all. Only for the hard-core 'must have everything' KISS fan. All others can pass on it.
1,BAD MOVIE,"I'm a big fan of horror movies, and I watched a lot of them, but this one doesn't have anything interesting for the horror genre...I do not recommend this movie...If you want horror, look for ""The Ring""..."
1,I THINK IS VERY AWFUL AND LONG,"I believe what they mean by island of the dead, is the undead flies and Rupert! I expected Zombies and horror goodness... What I got was a spanish cop, Rupert, flies, and dead people in the ground. Also I think the little dancing children were evil and usless to the story. The only thing that could help this movie is it having Evil deafd in the middle of the movie"
1,Great Premise...,This movie (like so many other horror movies) Started off great! It seemed so interesting. But the last 35 minutes was a complete waist of time! I was so frustrated because it initially gave me high hopes but alas save your money!!!
4,A Fast Read,"I thouroughly enjoyed reading this novel, it took me less than 24hrs to read. I've found that reading Danielle Steel novels you always learn some valuable information even if the story line does not always ring true to life. But hey, isn't that what romance novels are all about? The heroine always has money,or stumbles on to it and things generally work out in the end. There's great information on abuse here and hopefully a few women have been saved by this. Despite some of the other negative reviews this book got, if you love Danielle Steel or romance novels you'll like this book."
2,"Too repetitive, too long, --too bad.","Were do I start. This long 353 page book could have easily been 100 pages shorter. The highly charged subject matter of verbal and emotional abuse is very absorbing, but the author Danielle Steel, is continuously repeating herself over and over again. The main character Maddy Hunter is a very well known T.V. anchorwomen, married to her husband Jack, who is head of the TV network. Jack ""rescued"" Maddy from a previous abusive marriage and now jack is verbally abusing Maddy. The story seemed too ""fake"", too bad Danielle Steel's main character Maddy always seems to need the help of a man to get her out of bad situations. The unrealistic fairytale ending added to my dissapointment."
1,Disappointing,"I am surprised to see such favorable reviews of this book. I was struck by how poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly argued it was. The only thing worthwhile was the expository section setting the scene in Portugal, describing convent life, and the actual letters themselves. I found myself wondering who had edited this and how it got published."
3,Mega tablets --- beware!,"I love these Vit C tablets, but my husband is not able to swallow them. They really are very large."
5,I loved it,"The hands were not killers, just typical hands that any abover average player can handle. The pros can handle the pressure, and make fewer mistakes. But many of the hands they encounter are not the killers found in some of the hard Test Your declarer Play type books.Good hands, and fun to read. Good job, 2 thumbs up."
1,Not recommended,"The book opens in a promising way, nice science setup in a fictional context, nice introduction of the alternate universe... And then all of a sudden, a female character (who appears to be one of the main characters) is raped. No foreshadowing, no indication that something like that might happen in the book, nothing. The scene is completely out of the blue and gratuitous, and it was more than enough to turn my stomach and make me put the book away (and pretty much ruined my day). For anybody who has issues with this subject - I recommend you give this book a wide pass."
3,Homo sapiens are eeeevil,"I agree wholeheartedly with Steven Taylor's review of this book. I love Sawyer's writing in general, but he REALLY hits you over the head with social commentary. I felt preached to in many places, and it seems his intent is to make you feel guilty for being a human, especially a male human.Furthermore, I don't like how the privacy-less neanderthal society is presented as The Answer. It's ridiculous to think there wouldn't be any corruption in the system, that they got everything right the first time.The love story aspects of it are entirely not necessary for the plot in this book, and come across as being superfluous marketing. Though he may be building for something in the sequels.I've already purchased and plan to read the two sequels. I like the concept of the parallel neanderthal world and our interactions with it and am very curious about how it plays out. I just hope the guilt-trip gets toned down, because in general I dig Sawyer's writing."
2,PEERLESS PM610 (not ready for prime time),"Unlike other reviews I will not call this item a P.O.S. I will, however, state that unless you have a moderate level mechanical aptitude I would suggest you try another wall mounted stand. The wall mounting was self-explanatory and the shelves are quite stable. The problem lies in that the shelves themselves do not have adequate spacing for ""all"" makes of equipment. I had to remove one set of arms from the mounting bracket with a cutting wheel (kudos on your weld jobs)and re-weld them lower on the mounting bracket to allow enough space for my receiver, DVD, and cable box. Don't buy unless you can cut, weld, and swear."
4,Looks Great!,"I have mine mounted next to my plasma tv with the power cords of all my equipment going through the wall behind the tower to an outlet in my garage. Makes for a very clean look, no cords show at all.You may have trouble placing more than 3 components on the shelves unless they are all rather thin, I have my amp, satellite box, and dvd player on mine and it is full."
5,Just what I needed...and wanted!,"My husband said the only ottoman he wanted in our small room was one that would fit under a sofa table so it wouldn't be in the way when not in use. After weeks of searching for one that was the right size to keep the boy-kid (him) happy and the right color and fabric to keep the princess (me)happy, this one proved to be EXACTLY what we needed and wanted! Storage inside is nice, but the top is attached so it doesn't double as a tray like many other ottomans. No problem-I just place a book on the ottoman for my cup of coffee for a ""tray"" surface! Top stays open while you tuck things inside which is great, and the quality all around is really nice. Heavy enough so that when you put your feet on the edge to prop your knees a little higher it doesn't move away from you-nice bonus. Height is perfect, not too high or low. No funny smell that is common with furniture goods from foreign countries. One ottoman...two happy people!"
2,Excellent product when it works,"I purchased this product approximately one year ago. It will no longer mist the oil. I am having the same problem the other reviewer was having. I love the concept on the product if and when it works. I have cleaned it repeatedly with alcohol, but it does not work as before. I did try sticking by finger in the top and the mist came out for a short time. There is one thing you have to be careful with do not use a thicker oil. The product is not inexpensive so think twice before your purchase."
3,Works great,Exactly what I have been searching for. Have many outlets that are recessed due to panneling being retrofitted in rooms. This allows proper extension of actually outlet without using washers.
5,Great; please continue series,"This is a terrific book. Every article in it is well-written and interesting, unusual for an anthology as they almost always contain at least one or two flawed pieces. Not here. And what a range...from the usual suspects of Fortune, Wall Street Journal, etc. to the Detroit Free Press and even Mother Jones. The next volume for 2002 is also great."
2,Too pricey for its performance,"I bought this video card for my Linux m/c (yes, linux drivers are available for this card). It could not support more than 65,000 colors and I had to settle for that. At times when the screen refreshes, there is a large band of bad display at top of screen before the proper screen appears. For a video card that boasts 32Mb memory I expected better performance. For the same money you can get far better cards from Voodoo, ATI"
3,Extremely informative but somewhat academic,"This book is an excellent resource for ATM issues. Unfortunately, it is written in what I would call a European academic style (he is European) and that means that you will find yourself reading the same paragraph 3 or 4 times before really figuring out what he is trying to explain. If you can put up with the style, one of the best books around on ATM..."
5,It's the only book my kids want to read now!!,My kids and I both love the whimsical nature of both Farmer Brown books by Teri Sloat. The wording and pictures go perfectly together and are good for a laugh and putting us all in a fun and silly mood. I hope there are more Farmer Brown adventures to come!
4,Nice Jacket,"This is a nice jacket, it took a little longer than I was hopping to have it delivered but other than that no complates. I wanted something that would brake the wind while I ride my bike to work and maybe even to keep a light rain off, plus be visible and thats what I got."
5,love this so much,I love this movie because no. 1 John schneider is in it he is a hotty/hunkand because it can show that family can change the way people feel
4,DVD review,"I enjoyed the dvd. It was pleasant to watch and relitively well done. It won't make my top 100 list but it was still worth watching. It was like watching a college theatre performance, certainly not broadway but well constructed."
3,"really liked Xtro, mixed feelings about Xtro II","the original film seemed to have something different which sets it apart from the B horror genre. the special effects were great, a couple of disturbing scenes (the birth!), and mystery... i didn't know where exactly the film was going. because it was such a well-done, low budget British scifi/horror movie, Xtro reminded me a bit of Hellraiser. definitely worth seeing.Xtro II started out great; the main premise is about exploring parallel dimensions. however, once the movie really got started, it went downhill from there. cliche after cliche, cheap looking effects, the acting was uniformly poor... the style and tone of Xtro II was nothing like the original. aside from the title, there was virtually nothing connecting them. yes, disappointing.my recommendation is to buy it for Xtro (by itself, i'd give it 4 stars) and watch Xtro II (alone, i'd give it 2 stars) because it came with this DVD set.ia ia,Venger As'Nas SatanisCult of Cthulhu High Priest"
2,Doesn't stay suctioned on window!,"I thought I had found the perfect item to end the screaming from my infant for when the sun glares in his face while sitting in the back of the car, but the suction cups don't stick on! I tried sticking them in cold weather, warm weather, after wetting them and while dry. No luck! So I think I'm going to just try and rig on some other suction cups. The shade itself is a nice style and design, but the suction cups are no good."
3,Decent sunshade with room for improvement,"Pros: good size for most midsize sedans; clean minimalist appearanceCons: fabric is not very transparent: for a clear, reliable view of vehicles behind you, you will have to use your side-view mirrors; plastic anchors for vertical mounting behind rear headrests are clumsy and didn't fit either of my vehicles well."
2,Too small for Prius,Product is too small for the rear window of a Prius! I can see how it would work for SUV's.
3,Highlander 3 bombs,"Highlander three bombed compared to the other highlander movies. The acting is poor and the storyline leads nowhere. I am sure if there was a better actor to play the villian of the highlander, the movie might have been better."
1,NO SUBTITLES,The amazon description showed English subtitles and it has none. I can't even return it because I opened it and then realized when I started it that it had not subtitles!
5,The Bread Machine Magic Book of Helpful Hints,"Delivery was right on time. The book was used, but in ""like new"" condition.(As in the description) The book has been very useful to me, as I'm a new bread machine user. I would recommmend this book."
3,Reason 4 surpasses this,"With Reason 4 out, reason 3 is obsolete. But it's a good program, and very easy to learn, even in the newest incarnation.The synths are very versatile and easy to learn to program. The sequencer doesn't get any easier and the mixing console is very direct as is the patching if you want to fiddle with that. Thing is reason automatically patches things for you taking much of the drudger out of the mix.It doesn't handle live audio though, and that has been corrected with a new companion product, Record. I'm not sure if record works with Reason 3, but it works with Reason 4 out of the box.I coud go on but check out Reason 4 instead as I might write a review for that someday."
2,not worth the paper its written on,"Pros:1: Neatly laid out.2: Clear typing not to busy of pages.Cons:1: Has not been updated in 3 yrs. Exam has to change ??2: using ETC tells me the aurther asumes to much (Fatal error)3: First 5 pages all cramsession fuff, the last page diddo, so really of 16 pages 11 are mterial only.4:cost per page CDN almost 1$.(...)-MSCEA+NET+SCOCNA"
3,"Basic, But Practical","Its use in an MAS course is too basic. I would recommend the book for undergrad courses only. This has been mentioned previously and continues to be of concern for students seeking greater detail. It leaves me wanting more detail, you will be hard pressed using this as a major source for writing detailed papers. OVERALL.... the book should cost about $40 bucks tops and should remain out of MAS courses. It carry's a value but basic to advanced learning."
1,Reader from Chicago must be a family member,"The Reader from Chicago must be a family member of Bharati Kirchner to the rescue. The book is anything but interesting and most certainly does not portray life in India. There are many many authors of Indian origin who write far more compelling novels, with or without graphic sex. To compare Kirchner with Danielle Steele would be a step up for the author of Shiva Dancing."
2,Needed a better editor as well as a plot,"Not worth reading. The ending was very rushed, as well as the computer plot all of a sudden went nowhere. Everything was very convienient-Mom dying, Meena & Vishnu losing jobs, Vishnu found instantaneously.Throughout the book, time moves unevenly. You'll read the next paragraph and then realize that weeks or months went by. Character development is poor, and Meena is just ""too perfect"". Great at running, her job, gardening. Also, a poetry expert and volunteer with a close group of friends (whom with you only see Meena receive friendship, not give) as well as is physically beautiful.There are some lovely descriptions as well as a wonderful first chapter. This is why I gave the book 2 stars."
4,I really like this seat,"Ive gone through about 4 different high chairs and 3 different booster seats and I do like this booster seat a lot.. The tray is the perfect height for my 9 month old daughter and without the tray and front part, my 2.5 year old fits great. The only thing I dont like about it is cleaning, it has a lot of crack and crevices to clean but the majority of it comes apart so its not tooooo bad but it could have been better. I wouldn't put a small baby in it, like it suggests, but I wouldn't start solids until 8-9 months anyways."
4,We've gotten a lot of use out of this chair,"This chair has done it's duty! It seems comfortable for our son and fits great even on our smaller based chairs. I gave it 4 stars because it has so many crevices that food gets stuck in and is really difficult to clean. Because of this, I am going out today to get the baby bjorn booster seat-just a nice smooth surface to clean."
4,Shake-Away Fox/Bobcat Urine Rodent Repellant,"The whole idea was to prevent mice from entering my double garage/basement storage to begin with - I didn't want to deal with catching mice once they had already set up home. Once settled in their gestation period is three weeks and the average litter is 7 - 11. When we moved into our home, my wife suggested that there may possibly be mice - three months and 27 trapped mice later, I had had enough. I bought Shake-Away Rodent Repellant and shook the granules in the vicinity of all doors any any possible mouse access holes. Every now and then I shake more granules for good measure. Haven't had any mice since. I make certain to apply regularly in the fall, when creatures are looking for someplace warm to nest up. In addition, I also spray insect repellant around the garage doors and seem to have significantly reduced insect and spider invasion."
2,Groundhog problems,"I found that the shake away coyote repellant to be lessthan effective in detering groundhogs. After shaking the product in the hole he had dug, the groundhog not only returned to he hole but drug some the pellets back under my deck with it's belly."
3,ok for now,well i dont have mice but i am using it to prevent mice so if it works or not is yet to be seen ..... was deliverd on time
5,No wonder,"Hey, this stuff smells.Mice don't like things like peppermint and other odors that interfere with their sense of smell. I am using this in my garage and I am no longer seeing the cute little mousies.I don't blame them. It's no wonder they have found somewhere else to live. And, as long as I don't have mice, I can put up with the smell."
3,"OK Book, Outdated Ideas",This book is OK but some of the ideas and examples are already outdated. Some of the sites featured in the book have already been shut down! Does this mean idea viruses don't necessarily work? Or perhaps everyone's trying to use the concept of idea viruses to market their business and so the concept has lost its fizzle?...
3,Worth reading - for inspiration,"Like Godin's previous book, Permission Marketing, I found this book to inspire ideas, rather than give them. Godin has a knack for making people think - though I'm wondering if that was the intent with these books. If you are looking for definitive answers to business and marketing questions, steer clear of this one. If you are looking for a book that will get you thinking about the applications of viral marketing, then pick up a copy. Godin's e-mail newsletter is worth subscribing to and you can pick up a copy of the book at his web site as well."
4,Connect and then connect again,"""Unleashing the ideavirus"" seems to be the 2nd part in what I hope is a 3 part manifesto by Seth Godin. ""Permission Marketing"" introduced his concept (as he notes, an obvious but underpracticed one) that companies will be more successful if they first gain consumers permission to market to them. ""Unleashing the ideavirus"" carries this a step further and explains how you can then capitalize on that connection to get consumers to do your marketing for you. Don't buy this book if what you are looking for is a way to develop a marketing plan for your business. Do buy it if what you are looking for is a clear and concise message on why old style marketing is dead - or at least dying.The third part of the trilogy I would like to see - A how to book on developing Permission Marketing and Ideavirus'."
3,"Unleashing the ""lazy-marketers.com""","""Unleashing the IdeaVirus"" is a manifesto that prays that in the new economy the ideas that spread more quickly are the winners. The central message is that the ideas, like the viruses, can be contagious. And, in contrast to the traditional concepts of marketing, that tries to measure and to handle the spreading of the information, the book suggests that the information can be propagated in a more efficient manner from customer to customer then from company to customer. When creating an idea-virus, marketers produce an environment where the idea can replicate and therefore propagate itself. It is the virus that makes all the work and not the Marketing Department.In a nutshell, which is actually where this book could have been fitted instead of 197 pages, it says that anyone can make easy-money out of the internet. All you need is to have a dot.com business. I believe the late NASDAQ history says the opposite..."
2,An interesting artifact,"This is an unaltered reprint of a book published in 1912. It's primarily interesting as an example of what amateur scholars (especially in Britain) were putting out in that era. Cranky and usually hilariously offbase, but often fun to read. The author's etymological speculations are remarkable: a supposed root AK is the basis of Heracles, zodiac, yak (the animal), akbar ('great' in Arabic): ironically, the correct etymologies of these items were already well-known in 1912, though not, it would seem, to Mr. Bayley. The author's analysis of the Cinderella story will leave your head spinning!"
3,Where's the Beef?,"Please see my review for Russell Athletic pro cotton t shirt. My wife bought me two Hanes Beefy-T shirts in colors that I couldn't get in the Russell Athletic shirts. When I received and washed the Hanes shirts, I noticed several differences which I'll identify as negatives. One of the shirts had two little holes above the pocket which became frayed and noticable after the wash; something you see after a T-shirt is several months old. I also noticed that the sleeves were much shorter then the Russell Athletic shirts; this is a negative for me. The last thing I noticed was the material in the Hanes shirts were not of the same quality or thickness as the Russell Athletic. Overall, I rate the Hanes shirts as average and for the price, your better off with the Russell Athletic Pro T shirts. I've worn the Russell shirts for almost a year and the color has not faded and the shirt has kept it's shape with no little frayed holes that mark the end of the shirt's life."
5,"A little slow on delivery, but worth the wait","It's a bit odd to call yourself a tee shirt snob. I definitely am one. I have tried many different brands of hefty tees, and none compare to the quality, durability, and comfort of the Hanes Beefy Tee. After a couple washes, the shirt feels like it has been washed 50 times - super soft and comfortable, but not an ounce of wear."
4,It does what a tee should do.,"Very nice ttee, good heavy fabric. It has a pocket and is a nice, deep red, in addition to being affordable."
4,Don't rip this one apart,"One of the other reviewers on this page does not seem to know what he/she is talking about. The animals in the book do not talk. Instead, they are projected with dignity and accuracy. Jean Craighead George, author of the Julie books, the My Side of the Mountain books, and nearly eighty other wonderful nature stories for children, wrote DIPPER OF COPPER CREEK with her husband John George (they are now divorced), as well as VULPES THE RED FOX, VISON THE MINK, and other fine but, in my opinion, not appropriately recognized nature books. This is a wonderful book, and the story of a young boy becoming a man while his favorite birds become independent around him, is unforgettable. Any nature lover will appreciate this book. You must look deep into the poetic and beautiful text and know that this is indeed not a book to be ripped apart."
1,"I Hate this book, It is the worst book in the world.","I had to do this as a book report. There is not much to talk about it. I just hate it and wish I could rip it up. I did not like it because they changed the subject to much. I did not like that animals talked. It was very confusing. And too much detail, instead of sticking to the story line of the boy and grandfather on a mining trip."
1,Italian Idioms,I am usually very happy with Barron's books and have purchased quite a lot of them but this book is a lot smaller than I had hoped it would be. The print is very small and makes it hard to read and not very inviting to use. I thought it was going to be text book size but it is pocketbook size.Italian Idioms (Barron's Foreign Language Guides)
3,Disappointed...,"The reason I bought the book is to quench my crave in understanding of what human psychology is, in order to better (postively) influence. What I got was another pep-talk! The problem with this book is that the author somehow wanted to describe each letter in INFLUENCE with some stuff, but right after the third letter ran out of good ideas, so the rest of the book was filled either with repetition or some obscure stuff.If you have not read any basic leadership management books, this may be okay, but not sure if I would recommend other to pony up dollars for this!"
2,Not what I was looking for.,"As an admirer and student of John Maxwell, I was a bit disappointed with this one. I might offer this book as a primer on leadership for those with absolutely no knowledge, as its ideas are very general and paint a vague picture of how to deal with people. The advice in the book often resorts to truisms and cliches (the equivalent of ""treat people like they're important and you'll be important to them."") I usually highlight my books to death, but I honestly found very little new information aside from the occasional thought provoking rephrase or summary. A majority of the book is comprised of Jim Dornan's personal stories and miscellaneous oft cited quotes. For newcomers to the self-improvement/leadership topic I would offer ""The Magic Of Thinking Big"" or ""How To Have Power And Confidence In Dealing With People."" Seasoned leaders will most likely find nothing new here. Sure, you could find a lot worse things to read, but there are more helpful books out there as well."
3,Ttime tested ideas but not inspiring,"First, I respect John as a fellow Christian and his morals are unquestioned.I Just finished reading it and found it had several good points.John takes you through the steps of modeling, connecting, influencing and regenerating in a logical sequence. I find John has a good grasp on influencing, and mentoring, but his writing style is not very riveting.There were lots of great one liners from other authors and speakers, but the examples he uses fail to ignite. The study notes at the end of the chapters are useful. When I read John's books, it feels more like an assignment that I must struggle through than a journey that I enjoy. I think there are much better books on the subject and this one is a bit dated. Try ""Tribal Leadership"" also.Phillip c. Neal DDSTribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization"
2,"Well, we could do better...","Ok, sorry kids, but for the price, why not get the Riva chipset? In my experiences, it is faster and more reliable than the Voodoo chips. Or, you could wait until the price of the GeForce comes down a bit. That is a very good chipset, at least according to my friends and every review I've read. I can't wait to get my hands on one, honestly. Come now, 16 megs of onboard RAM? That's it, on this brand-new top-of-the-line board? My Viper V770 came with 32 megs, and that was almost a year ago. The new GeForce cards have 32 megs as well, so where is that other 16 megs that the Voodoo is missing? The only advantage to the Voodoo card is that it has 3dfx capability, and that's not that big of an advantage if you know anything about 3d accelerators. Nope, that money would be better spent elsewhere..."
1,Be careful Jomashop is not an authorized dealer,"I bought this pen and when sent to Montblanc for repair, the truth came out that Jomashop is not an authorized dealer. The pen in itself is great and love it. Infact, after talking to Montblanc customer service they mentioned that Jomashop has been warned many times and legal case is on them for selling unauthorized way. It is 'what you pay is what you get'.Buy from an authorized dealer and you will get your moneys worth. Take from experience that it is not worth it.-Reggie"
1,Looks like used Looks like not original,Looks like used And have a damage or defect of manufactured.I'm confused And i want To know if this product is original.Tomorrow I'll visit the local store of Mont Blanc To confirm the garranty And the originally.I talk To You soon
3,Nice camera bad customer sapport,This is my first digital camera so I really have nothing to compare it to. It seemed easy to use. All though it really uses up batteries. The Lcd Display is nice but unviewable out side in the day light. I had to get it repaired after owning it less then one year because the LCD display started rolling and I can tell you customer sapport is a joke. They tell you the wrong things to do like buying a extended warranty and then not knowing any thing about it and when you try to straight it out they give you the run around. I bet I've talked to 5 people now and waiting to hear from a sixth that sapposed to straight it out but it's been 2 days and nothing. I would not buy this carmera just because of the bad sapport. I'm mad as hell!
5,A Great Bargain!,"(...) It is an ideal camera for starting into digital photography. It has all the features that you might want except, perhaps, for a Red Eye Reduction. In fact, on digital photography it is not Red but White, so it is very hard to correct with any available software. Ask the user not to look at the camera. It helps."
3,"Reasonably entertaining, but not very believable","The first and last quarter of this book are interesting, but the middle half is a bit boring (where he describes in detail a large number of drug deals).Overall I thought the book was ok, but I have two issues with it:1. It's simply not believable. Marks wants us to believe that all drug dealers are really nice, relaxed people who look out for each other and have no interest in violence or any sort of temper. Screw up a massive drug deal? No problem buddy. I also didn't really believe the bit about him not being a snitch.2. The book focuses too much on facts (I did x, then y, then z) and doesn't really talk much about the emotion of the event, or Marks' opinion or philosophy on things. He wants himself to come across as ""nice"" (like every other drug dealer it seems!) but he just comes across as someone who doesn't really have much of a personality.But overall, it's an ok read."
5,great book,"this book was awesome, found it in some back alley in phnom phen for 25 cents and couldnt put it down. you want howard to keep smuggling and escape all the time. you can't help rooting for this guy. well written, and a great story. very enjoyable."
3,How autonomous human attempts to live without faith leads to functional Idolatry,"What a thrilling way to learn about the fundamental problem of being human in God's world from a wide variety of source material - from Orthodox and Neo-orthodox Christian theologians to psychologists and psychotherapists! Karen Horney's contribution to psychotherapy is identified as a significant thinker that allows Cooper to integrate the polarized proponents for pride and self-contempt as humanity's pathological problem.This is an excellent read for Christian ministers to understand their own folly and those whom they seek to bring to acceptance; namely, justification by grace alone through faith in Christ."
1,Don't Waste you money!,Don't know why Amazon even still sells this????? It is very dated (only up to version 5.0(1)).No Access list examples or coverage. Only gives examples of conduits on outbound statemens which are being phased out in version 6.3.
4,Studies find this to be effective,"I used to take Crestor and had some side effects. My Dr suggested I try red yeast rice instead. I did some research and found studies saying it was effective in lowering cholesterol. I have been taking it for about a month and feel fine. I don't think it is causing the same problems that Crestor did. I can't tell yet if it has lowered my cholesterol as I have to take it for a few months first. All I can say for now: ""So far so good""."
3,Good as any,"Well, like I said, this book is as good as any other on the subject. Not better than the others, just as good as, but I only gets a three because it cost too much (when it was new)."
3,Not as pictured,I got these for my wedding and they aren't as pictured. Instead of being satin they are silver with black specks. Looks like something I would wear out at night but not for my wedding. I called customer service and they offered for me to return them. I ended up keeping them and wearing them at my wedding since no one saw my shoes most of the time. Not happy with them.
2,Could have been better,"Arikha does a good job with a fascinating subject - an intellectual history of the theory and practice of medicine. As she shows, long-authoritative theories of the four humors profoundly influenced people's lives until only very recently. This makes the book worth buying. With such a good subject, though, it's too bad that Arikha did not take the trouble to do a better job. The book is about twice as long as it should be, and we lose track of the forest in her minute, repetitive descriptions of trees. Moreover, Arikha apparently did not consult very many original sources, and instead mainly presents a re-churning of the secondary literature. Had she better mastered the originals, she might more confidently have been able to tell us what it all means."
5,passions and tempers: a history of humours,"I am amazed at the riches in this book, a history of our thinking about our mind/body -- the lively, learned writing, the fascinating detail, the accessible explanations of exotic material. It's therapeutically humbling in its rendition of what the author calls ""the fragility of our embodied selves;"" provocatively humbling too in its sly teasing of our nwarranted confidence that in this scientific age we, unlike our ancestors, are somehow free of superstition."
1,Errol is still a hero to me,"Charles Higham ceased to cumber the Earth with his mendacity on April 21, 2012, when he did us all the big favor of croaking. He left behind him a long list of gossipy biographies full of lies and half-truths. I became an enthusiastic Errol Flynn fan at the age of 14 in 1958, when there was a series of re-runs of Flynn movies on TV. I lapped them up like a cat at a bowl of cream. Flynn was still alive at that time. His pattern of sexual behavior hardly indicates the possibility that he was bisexual. As for the Nazi spy nonsense, this is so ridiculous that there is no need to refute it."
1,Garbage.,"Charles Higham's so-called biographies are filled with rumors printed as truth (and many of the rumors seem to be created by Higham, himself).The fact that every one of his books sold well for a week when released, but are never republished speaks for their worth.""The best ammunition against lies is the truth, there is no ammunition against gossip. It is like a fog and the clear wind blows it away and the sun burns it off."" - Ernest Hemingway"
1,THIS IS A WORKBOOK,"I was aware of that before ordering, but If you skim through the reviews you would think that this book has it all. It does not. It's a companion for a textbook by the same name. I would not have ordered this if it weren't for the glowing reviews here. My mistake, but most of the reviews here are for the textbook and not this workbook--I don't want others thinking they are getting something they are not. I'm ordering the textbook now and will update this review soon. I need to thank reviewer Don V for the tip to search for 1551117789--that will bring up the textbook when searching Amazon."
3,Good product,Works well on frizzy or damaged hair. Keeps fly-aways down and makes hair feel soft again.
4,Good for the Price,"Really like the shirt. It fits well, and is comfortable. The collar goes down a little farther than I would like, but other than that it is a great shirt for the price."
3,Almost worked,"Fits well on the rail, however, it didn't quite catch the rail below to allow it to sit upright. I zip tied some 6 inch pieces of wood onto the back and now it sets well. Holds the pot well. Would probably buy again since I know how to fix the problem."
2,Not very good for a privacy fence. :(,"I am so disappointed with this item. After looking at many of the reviews for this and other products like it, I went ahead and ordered. The shipping was fast and the item arrived in good condition but it did not work out as I had hoped. Nobody mentioned if it would work on a vinyl privacy fence but the fence width fell within the limits stated. I wanted to hang it on the fence outside my kitchen window. Well, first of all, it hangs too high on the fence and I had to add a handmade spacer to the brace to make the flower box hang correctly. It is usable but not at all what I had hoped for. It may be great for the wrought iron types of fences but not great for a privacy fence!"
1,Does not brown evenly,"I bought an Oster toaster because the last one I had, which is no longer made, worked perfectly. This toaster does not perform to even the lowest standards, browning one side much faster than the other, and unevenly. I have to toast the bread twice, turning it after the first round and if I'm not careful it burns. I am very disappointed."
1,This toaster does not work properly,"I should have known better. I bought the Oster 6329 toaster prior to this one. It didn't work properly. Frozen waffels were soggy on one side and the bagel setting didn't turn off the outside elements. Well, that was a $30 toaster. I bought this one for $20 bucks figuring that the last one was just a fluke. Surely, right? Nope! This one doesn't work either. Pressing the bagel button doesn't do anything. What is Oster up to? They obviously don't test their products. I'll never buy another Oster product again. $50 bucks for two different toasters and I still don't have a toaster that works! Maybe I can get at least get my $20 bucks back for this latest Oster fiasco. Don't do business with Oster."
3,"Entertaining, but the pacing could be better","I found the movie entertaining. True, it's essentially a rip off of Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer with a basketball theme, and not as well done, but it was entertaining. That being said, it did have several slow parts, and some rather cheesy plot points, not to mention very overt deus ex machina type resolutions, but nontheless it was entertaining. Worth a watch if you have the time and nothing better to do."
5,"Jefferson the "" American Mind""","This study is a wonderful compilation of the life and writings of Thomas Jefferson. The introduction by Koch and Peden of Jefferson's long and fruitful life is rich and complete. Jefferson's greatness shines forth in the pages of this volume. His Anas, Autobiography, Essay of the Anglo Saxon language, Notes on Virginia, And his numerous public papers and letters show the reader the depth of this great man. Koch and Peden clearly admire Jefferon which is a welcome respite from the sad and anti-intellectual deconstructionist philosophy of modern historians. No PC here. For a student of Jefferson, or someone attempting to familiarize themselves with his ideals, this is a great buy!"
5,"This isn't bad at all, and it isn't good either... it's more","I have no idea where the two dorks from New York came off thinking these guys sound like Green Day or Offspring, or ever mention masturbation... They're a Christian band! Duh! Anyway, the CD is great, the band is great, and I like their style, it's not like really any other band. But if I was to make a comparison I'd say that The Ataris is the closest to them. If you like the Ataris, you'll love these guys, and you'll definetely love the CD."
1,Bad music...I totally agree with Pomona guy,"How could anybody like this garbage? I totally agree with the guy from Pomona. I don't understand how anyone could disagree. No mistake about it, unless if by coincidence he heard a band just as bad as this one."
5,Great Product for Price,"When shopping for an HTIB, I was looking for something with component inputs, did not have an integrated DVD player and would pass the WAF (wife acceptance factor). She liked the black finish of this set as opposed to the silver of many other units. Out of the box this was relatively easy to setp up and sounded pretty good. Have made some speaker level tweaks to optimize the sound for my living room and I think I have just about got it right.Pros: Built in XM tuner (should I decide to activate it on my account), powered or line level output for subwoofer, 5.1 inputs for SACD/DVD Audio, user assignable digital inputsCons: Only one coax inputWould recommend to people who are looking for an inexpensive HTIB that looks and sounds good."
5,WHO WAS THAT LADY IS SPECTACULAR !!!!!!!!!,"NORMAN KRASNA, WRITER AND PRODUCER, CREATED A TRUE FILM CLASSIC IN THIS ONE!!! HE PUT TOGETHER DEAN MARTIN, TONY CURTIS, JANET LEIGH, JOY LANSING +++ AND CREATED ANOTHER ONE OF HIS FABULOUS COMEDIC MASTERPIECES."
2,Too thin on real info,"As others have written here, skip this and get Sartre for Beginners instead. That book, while not comprehensive, does a better job of fleshing out most of his major concepts in a more useful fashion. This book you just sit down and read. The for Beginners series is a better reference that you can turn to again and again to refesh you knowledge."
1,Insulting,"This book merits no review. It is insulting to mislead anyone to think he/she can understand Jean Paul Sartre in ninety minutes. Most people do not have the intelligence to understand his ideas; those who do spend years thinking. It isn't pablum, and there is no clue if you don't have a brain. There are those who get it and those who don't. A book which claims to have the key should have been written on disposable paper."
4,Pretty good envelopes,"These are good heavy weight envelopes 24# and they take laser print very well, for the price they are a good buy. I just wish they had been security tinted, but with their thickness it appears this may not be a problem."
3,"Not what I ordered, but pretty good","Though these envelopes say they are security-tinted, they are not - at least the two shipments I received aren't.My first order arrived well-packaged but incorrect. The description states CO131 #10 security envelopes, but I received CO138 NON-security envelopes. I did a return, which I must say Amazon makes very easy, but my replacement order was also the (incorrect) CO138 non-security type. Oh, well...I needed some 24lb envelopes, since my new laser printer doesn't really handle my cheapie old 20lb envelopes very well. Even though these are not security envelopes, they are nice, and since the wait time is now 1-2 months, I'll just order again some other time."
4,Appointment for Murder,"This book is a detailed story of a dentist who lived out his violent fantasies, leading him to murder innocent men. Dr. Engleman's sex life, family life, and religious beliefs are described in a way so that the reader can form an understanding of why he commited his crimes. Bacos does not give much analysis; therefore, it is more like reading a fiction novel than a nonfictious story. The dialogue from the ATF's tapes allows the reader into the mind of a power hungry Mama's boy."
4,Wife Loves It,"We absolutely love this phone. My wife was in search for a new phone, but we didn't want to spend a whole bunch of money, and she loved the old Nokia's. This is great for someone who doesn't need a lot of bells and whistles. This is pretty much a straight phone, but it is incredibly light and thin. Much more then I first thought, almost as thin as a RAZR. So if you are just looking for a reliable phone to make phone calls with, but like a thin light phone, this might be the phone for you."
1,Didn't quite buy the story,"This is my third Lavyrle Spencer book. I couldn't believe it was written by the same person. I agree with the other reviews that mentioned the goody-goody teenagers. I got really tired of Claire's anger - it lasted throughout most of the book. When a total of three people confirm your husband is not fooling around and you still think he's lying - women get over it! I was really glad when this book ended. If you enjoy Lavyrle's other books, don't waste your time on this one, it is unrealistic and boring."
2,Overly simplistic,"While I enjoyed reading a story of triumph in the aftermath of the Civil War, I found the story too simple and lacking in tension or true drama. I was happy for the characters success, I was never fully engaged in the story. I am a big fan of J. California Cooper, but I think this is her worst effort. I am usually moved beyond words by her work, but this time I regretted money spent on a hardback book. I should have borrowed it."
5,I love her writing,"I have always been a big fan of J. California Cooper. She does not disappoint in ""The Wake of the Wind"". This story flows like a beautiful song. Like always her words are lyrical. Lifee is inspirational and character that you could not help but admire. Sometimes books with motivational themes aren't very exciting, but the twists and turns of this story made it hard to put down. Besides ""Cane River"" this is one of the best historical fiction novels I have read in a while."
3,1st track is too good,"Frankly i loved the 1st track, 3rd & 5th track were o.k but rest of the tracks were not that great. This is my personal opinion, others may not agree and thats o.k."
2,Universal?,"Hooked it up as the directions stated, could not get it to do what it is supposed to to. I'll keep trying but Im starting to think its a lost cause."
2,Decptive product listing,"**SELLER NEEDS TO CORRECT THEIR DECEPTIVE DESCRIPTION**I ordered this before and received 5 terminal relays, but received 4 temrinal relays this time around. Without the N.O. terminal you can not use this for some (5 wire) power lock installations unlike how they are advertising this product. If you need the N.O. terminal I highly suggest ordering elsewhere. If you need just a 4 wire setup then this will work just fine."
2,Compelling premise dragged down by over-indulgent direction,"Being one of the highlights of French cinema in the past year, I really expected more from She's One of Us. The premise is extremely compelling, but the narrative almost immediately becomes bogged by incredibly self-indulgent direction and overly dry performances. Is there such a thing as a director being too French?A disappointment."
3,Moments of suspense,There was too much blatantly borrowed from Jamaica to truly believe in this place and the story got old. There were twists and turns but it was a weak effort by an author I usually enjoy.
1,Pitiful...,I wish they'd pull this one from the market. I've never heard a soul say anything good about it. It's just out there so Patterson fans will accidentally buy it. DON'T BUY IT!! It is nowhere near the quality of any of his other books! Get ANYTHING else by Patterson and it will be better than this.
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I'm a huge James Patterson fan, and I purchased this book without reading any reviews. Oh, what a mistake that was! The writing was choppy, the sentence structure hard to follow, and the story line bland.This definitely does NOT compare to his later works."
2,I FEAR THAT THIS ONE JUST DID NOT DO IT FOR ME.,"I write very, very few reviews in which I trash a book or an author. I am giving this one two stars simply because the author is James Patterson, and I do admire much of his work. This book though, my goodness, I could not even finish it! That is a very rare event in my life. The story was forced, disorganized and simply not good. The characters had no character and were very poorly developed. The story is simply about a couple killing people, innocent people. Might as well watch the evening news. I do not recommend this one, although I do still recommend the larger body of this author's work. Sorry James, this is the best I could do with this one."
1,would not suggest this book to a Patterson reader!,"this was the most disappointing book i've read by Patterson - can't blame Amazon, book was delivered in the time they said it would be"
2,Confusing!,"I was listenting in my car and neither I or my wife could follow along. The author jumps back and forth by days, weeks, months and years. I was so confused that I finally gave up. I tried to follow the story line and couldn't. But, I did lend the audio book out to two other avid readers, and they had the same problem (following the story line). They gave up also. The other issue I had, was with the reader(Lou Diamond Phillips) personally, one of my favorite actors. I just could not visualize the characters. I just kept seeing him sitting at the microphone reading the story. This was my issue. Other people may not have this problem. It's a confusing story.I think badly written by Patterson. Just my opinion."
3,Season of the Machete,"The book arrived as promised in great condition.The book is one of James Patterson's earlier works (1977),and is very dated, but still a decent book."
3,Beyonce's Back!,"Beyonce teams up with ex?-boyfriend Jay-z again after the smash 03' Bonnie&Clyde.Crazy In Love is already a hit, reaching the top spot in billboard, TRL, and doing well in Europe too. It's a good funky tune, but not as sophisticated as you have experienced in Destiny's Survivor album.Jay-z's flow gives a lot to the song, but sorry, Bonnie&Clyde was much better.I don't recommend you the single, instead try the Dangerously In Love album, there are some much better songs than this.Check out the remake of In Da Club!"
2,Jabra EarSet WindUP,"I found this item to be disappointing.The locking device on the wind up failed to lock.Jabra replaced the item after I sent my original back to them. It locked maybe 3 times.I can honestly say I was not ""too rough"" on the product.I was particularly careful with the second one.The sound is OK and I am comfortable using it.The selling point of the wind up feature was not worth the cost. Take your chances the Amazon.com price is much better than the $30 I paid for it.Who knows? I may try again!"
3,"OK, if you have the patience for it","I used this ear piece for about 3 months feeling pretty satisfied. I never had complaints about sound quality, and if fact I could hear better using it than without. It's true that no matter what size, the ear gel become uncomfortable after a while. And if you use your cell phone as your primary phone like I do, that's a big concern. Also, the winder on this thing is complete GARBAGE. I can't tell you how many times it would not wind up or unwind...the cord got tangled, and finally the whole thing just stopped working. I bought this to replace the other Jabra I had that didn't have the winder because I hated the cord getting caught on everything...now I don't like either of them. Guess I'm back to trying to find another one..."
1,World full of Morons,That's funny some moron is charging $119 for these when last week I bought them from Target for $4.95 each...
5,Simplified,"Echoing a previous commentator, the emphasis of this book is definitely Vipassana. Nevertheless, it is an exceptionally lucid read - quite a contrast to some of the more abstruse texts associated with Theravada. I thoroughly enjoyed the clarity of the work and find it a great addition to my small library of buddhist writing."
2,"Cute, but not worth what I paid.",The necklace is MUCH smaller than I anticipated but still very cute. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions because it doesn't seem worth what I paid now that I have seen it in person. The chain is very delicate and isn't strong enough for daily wear. I'd recommend getting a strong chain if you plan on wearing this for more than special occasions.
1,This is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This product is too small,if christmas wasnt just around the corner it would have got sent back. I dont sugguest you get it, especially for $70 dollars"
2,Not a happy camper,I was not happy with the Gold Heart Devil Diamond Pendant because the pendant (as you can see in the picture) was not centered with the chain. If Amazon would purchase a different one that looked better than I would purchase it again. Thanks Monya
4,A Pleasing Adaptation of a Good Book,"This film was based on the exotoc and exciting first novel by William Diehl. While it does away with much of the back story of the two bad guys--especially Victor--the stars and screenplay reflect well the gritty, sexy police drama of the novel. Rachel Ward is stunning as Domino, the $1000 a night hooker who becomes the subject both of Sharky's investigation (hence the term ""machine"" for his operation)and his sexual obsession. Burt Reynolds is excellent as the ""cop on the edge,"" the supporting cast is great, especially Charles Durning and Bernie Casey, and the setting in Atlanta is fresh after all of the cop movies done in LA or NYC."
5,Great Faucet!,"What a great purchase! Easy to install and looks great. The sprayer is so powerful, I didn't realize how weak my old one was and now wish I had replaced it a long time ago."
2,QC issue,"I bought two same faucets before they are good quality but this third one has Q.C. issue (some dings cosmetic defects on its skin); however, its functionality is still OK."
2,This song is good BUT:,If you want to here good metal listen to their old stuff or the new rob zombie album is very good also. Of their new stuff this song is in the top 5.
5,One of the best,This is one of the best seasons yet. They are getting closer and closer to revealing Clark's true destiny and it is wonderfully done.
3,Change of Packaging,"Great series however if you have collected the box sets like myself you will be very disapointed in the way this product is packed. Why they couldn't keep the original packaging i don't know, cost cutting most likely. It is very disapointing."
5,Great Last Season,What is there not to like? its a shame its ended. Lets hope the actors go on to new roles as good as this series is.
4,"Good, but not great","The main theme of this season is one of transition. We see Clark get closer to Lois, and move further from Lana. We see the appearance of new villains now that Lex Luthor is gone.At the end of the day however, while it was a good season, they failed imo. This was Doomsday's season, and they had a great concept with Davis Bloome... and it could have been so much better. There was retconning, plot holes, and a nonclimatic final fight scene."
5,Season 8,IS it just going to be oliver on the cover?Season 8 had its up and downs. there's going to be a season 9! yeah!
2,"Bad, Gory and offensive","I like alot of others was originally a fan because we wanted to see Supermans back story. Other then the familar names all of us Superman fans know,you will hardly recognise this gore fest. The constant comparisons to Jesus are offensive. Clark can only save you from accidents!Jesus saves souls. (they bring it up,not me).Gory season with rip and slash thanks to Doomsday. Nothing like the comics where doomsday fights superman to the death.Dream secuence with clark ripped in half alone was enough for me. Impalements etc...Lana comes back again and the supposedly extremely moral Clark ends up in bed with her.. Most good shows you want to find out what happens, this show we are waiting for clark to put on the cape, to fly, to be a hero. Here he's a guy whos so passive it drives you crazy...Time to end this show.."
3,Seemed like a filler,Some interesting things about Davis's past are introduced. It really brought me back though to the stupid part in the old seasons about the native american caves. I feel like smallville should separate itself from high school problems in smallville and move into comicbook greatness in metropolis.
5,Show was exciting and fun to watch,My order came quickly and was in perfect condition. I enjoy the whole series I bought.
4,Smallville Season 8,"I've been a Smallville fan for a long time. I've seen every episode and watched it faithfully every thursday (soon to be friday) since I can remember. I thought Season 8 was good. I dont know why so many people said it wasnt very good. The only thing about Season 8 I would complain about would be the Clark/Lana aspect. It didnt seem necessary to bring her back in the first place but then to turn her into some superhuman in an alien suit was a little much for me. I liked how Lois had more screen time in this season since she plays the character really well. Overall I would say it was a good season, probably not the best, but certainly worth checking out."
2,Does fall down on its face a little this year. BAD PACKAGING!,"My wife and I have enjoyed the series for many years as have our kids, now 16 and 12 so they have really grown up with this.My wife was dissapointed that Lex is gone. Also she felt that, as do I, that the Justice League needs to come out to play more. They are a large part of the lore of Superman. This season seems like it is becoming something like a One Tree Hill or some other teen angst tv show more then it used to be.Also, as others have stated the package design is terrible. Mine had SIX broken pieces of plastic and the whole bottom part where the bottom cylinder fits down was totally shattered. The first 4 seasons are great packages, after that the package has gotten terrible.I emailed the WB to let them know about my broken package but of course no response, as they already have my money I assume.So overall would almost give this season a three as it is OK, barely, but the package design knocks it down a star, so 2 stars it is."
2,Meh.,"Smallville started out with such promise. But somewhere along the way it got derailed. Maybe it was the repetitive nature of each episode. Maybe it was the hokey dialogue, 1 dimensional characters or uninspired plot lines. All three? I was hoping when they finally pushed him out of Smallville and into Metropolis that the show would get more interesting, but alas, that never happened. Unfortunately, this show is best enjoyed for free. I kind of wish I didn't spend the money to buy this set, but the OCD guy in me wanted to complete the collection."
2,"too bad,so sad","I was looking so forward to Smallville, it is the only show on TV my wife and I don't miss. When i found out the the old writers left at the end of season 7, I was a little worried. My worries came to be true. This was one of the greatest series ever made,it was horrible last year. The thing they used to do the best, have four or five stories going on inside the big story, were gone. They couldn't even do one story well. If it is a bad this year as last, I hope they end it, and not torture knowing how great season 1-7 were. I was always hoping to see Clark dawn the blues and reds at the last show, with these writers that will probably never happen! How can you get rid of Lex?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Suction cup toy,"She liked it, but the toy with the cow that jumps over the moon came broken, the music did not play.Also, these toys are NOT good for the highchair as suggested because they do not wash well, water gets trapped inside and the toy is ruined."
2,A MAJOR LETDOWN,"After the achingly beautiful and heartfelt ""The Book of Mercy,"" Kathleen Cambor has thrust ""In Sunlight in a Beautiful Garden "" on us. I would guess that the idea of ""novelizing"" an actual event seemed like a good one to Cambor but in her hands this effort falls flat even though there are some beautifully written passages as in Julia's thoughts after the death of 2 of her children: ""..the charm, the tenderness, the wit she'd always counted on, that her mother always said were part of her good character, had disappeared like so much smoke. She was left hollowed, fractured, parched."" What I'm saying is that Kathleen Cambor is a fine writer but her talents are not suited to this particular subject. What happens is, because there is so much exposition needed to propell this story, that Cambor's talent is squandered. ""In the Sunlight in a Beautiful Garden"" is a noble failure but a failure nonetheless."
5,Dreams of Yesterday,"I cannot give you information about the author as I could not find any, except that she is an author who has won several awards and who, by the nature of this book, does meticulous research before she writes about a subject. In this book she captures the imagination with her portrayals of innocence in all its splendor shining next to the most infamous type of greed, a greed that never considers the effects of ones own greed on others. The characters are all fully drawn and you either love them or pity them or despise them. Regardless they tell the story of the main character, and her fairy tale childhood so that you almost walk in the woods with her and share her first feelings of grown love. And, when it comes to the climactic scenes of the Johnstown flood-you are there also. This is book that I really enjoyed and hated to finish."
5,Sepia-toned slice of life,"Brava! to Kathleen Cambor for her lyrical, achingly insightfulexploration of a tragedy that did not have to happen. Shetranscends the best of historical fiction (my favorite genre)with a truly poetic combining of fact and fiction, characterand plot, action and contemplation that is truly mesmerizing.Her luminous prose far surpasses any I've read recently(including several very well-received books). But her greatestaccomplishment is to make her reader experience the gut-wrenching, profound sense of loss that people of 1889 (or of any other time with great national disaster--such as September 11th) must have experienced. As with a sepia-toned photograph insunlight, in a beautiful garden--our reaction to nostalgiamixed with beauty mixed with longing is almost unbearable."
2,And the point was?,"Led by the Oprah book club, I read ""Here on Earth"". Although it wasn't my usual type of read, I finished it and thought I would give another Hoffman novel a chance. Why did I waste my time? ""Turtle Soup"" started out sad and depressing and kept up that pace.I never cared about any of the characters--Lucy and Julian probably deserved one another. It was just a bad bad book.This book would not make it to my recommendation list. (And I do like most of the Oprah books!)"
2,Didn't live up to my expectations,"I decided to read this book based on the fact it got such glowing reviews, and also the fact that I had just read ""Local Girls"" and thoroughly enjoyed it. Now, I doubt if I'll ever read Alice Hoffman again. The characters in the book were completely unsympathetic and uninteresting. Many of the characters were underdeveloped. The main character, Lucy, was completely unbelievable. I found myself thinking many times, ""Yeah, right, a real mom would NEVER act that way!"" The only reason I give the book two stars is that I like Hoffman's style and use of words to paint a picture. If you're going to read a Hoffman novel, go with Local Girls."
3,Very interesting,"I brought this book because in my music and movement class we were discussing how certain song, rhymes, and nursery fables cam about. I love this book, it's very interesting; however, it didn't have many of the interesting comments my professor was telling the class in it. I had to do more web searching to find an even deeper background, but I will keep and recommend this book."
5,Truly Amazing!,"This game is without a doubt the single best baseball game to ever come out. Surpassing the old All-Star baseball franchise and the Triple Play franchise. The game is rich in color, sound and deep gameplay. The graphics are excellent and all players, stadiums and rosters are accurate as of January 2005. There are several different modes, including; exhibition, dynasty, owner, mini game, homerun showdown, and manager.The game is just amazing, and so addictive.Buy it."
5,This game is fun,"This is a great game, i am a basketball and football fan, but not baseball. i play madden and live, but i am overseas and i played those so much that i got tired of them. i bought this game cuz i wanted to try something new and have something else to play. i picked MVP over 2K5 because i like EA over 2K. I am playing owner mode and i'm about 30 games in with the Mets. it's fun, you lose money at first but if your team is goods and the teams you play are good you can get a lot of money. just remember this i dont like baseball but i like this game. try it and you'll be playing it whenever you get a chance. I'm mad cuz i dont hit many HRs i have 8 through about 30 games but i am like 18-12 so as long as i win i'm happy."
2,"Erm, what happened?","I played MVP first than I got MLB. I enjoyed it but when I got MLB, I was stunned and felt that MVP was worthless compare to MLB. The only fine thing was Owner Mode and Graphics. Using the hitter's eye was too easy. I never got struck out. Precision bar was too hard. No crowd cutscenes like Madden. That was totally dissapointing for MVP. MLB had some problems too, but it wasn't really big problem for game. Just normal things.Summary: Save your $10 for MLB. Also I recently heard that MVP's got locked up for 7 years. Well I'm sorry for EA, but Take Two wins this year and for 7 years."
5,who cares,you talk about barry not being in this game but who cares cuz you can edit the player in place of him to make it barry you dumbcraps
3,Slight rusting after first use,"Very cute cuters. Some are difficult to use due to how slender areas are, also at times causing loss of some detail. These are definitely hand wash and immediately dry type of cuters. I would still however reccomend them, because they still work quite well for the price. We've used mostly the shark and it was a great hit."
4,""" Jump up & down """,I have worn out my cassettes for this tape along with the other Jack Green albums.They just don't make good party music like this anymore !!!!!
4,Green with envy!,"Just a fantastic rock record.....nothing more,nothing less. Brilliant guitar playing and instantly catchy tunes that have not dated through the years."
3,Great bargain with one big glitch,"The price is definitely right, looks nice, sounds great. Unless you're setting it up in a closet you'll need much more speaker wire though. One big problem with mine, however - while playing DVDs the audio will mute at random times during playback, usually 3 or 4 times. Simply hitting the volume button on the remote brings it back, but it's quite annoying. Perhaps it's overheating (I have it set up in an entertainment center, not a lot of airflow) so it could be that the problem is on my end. If that's the case I would give it 5 stars for value for the money."
2,USB Optical Mini,On the first use the cord became jammed. The mouse is still usable but the cord is a mess. Product was a nice idea but in use was dissapointing.
2,bright and functional for a while,"The mouse worked instantly on my Macintosh as soon as I plugged it in. It is small (about 3""), glides easily and is quick. It requires slight effort to push the scroll wheel which I see as an advantage because that prevents accidental scrolling. The mouse glows red which prevents it getting lost, has a thin 2' cord, and works well on a mouse pad, cloth or hard surface.EDIT: the mouse stopped working after a few months so I changed the rating to two stars."
1,Fail me Two times!,"The first one dead in 48 hours.The second dead in two days.The third one, ..., not a chance, order canceled. No charge at all! Thx Amazon."
2,Doesn't Retract,"The retractor mechanism didn't work properly from Day 1. It would either get stuck or tangled, and after a week it broke completely. Also the left clicker button is a bit stiff, so sometimes it's hard to double click quickly. And the mouse is quite tiny. On the bright side, it's a lovely red color and it comes with a cute carrying pouch. But I'm returning it."
1,Serious junk,"I bought this mini-mouse to replace a 6 year old Kensington USB mini-mouse whose scroll wheel was dying. I figured how hard could it be find a basic replacement. Harder than I thought, apparently. This Iomega mouse looked cheap right out of the box and feels very flimsy. All of which I could get over if it was actually functional, but it's not. It's rather insensitive to movement so you find yourself jiggling it around to get it to start moving your cursor?! If you don't use it for a few minutes, it appears to go to ""sleep"". You have to click a button or tap it on the desktop to wake it up and remind it to... be a mouse! Remarkable they would sell a product like this. I emphatically recommend you try a different product."
4,Helpful,"I had one problem with it: because of an auto-off feature that saves the battery, it wouldn't allow my computer to sleep and it kept turning back on after I'd put it down. Customer service helped out right away. not only did they send me easy tech instructions as to how to disable a simple feature so that the computer would sleep no problem."
3,Rent before you buy!,"Too long, predictable dialog, background music that isn't background, occasionally blasting out over the scene, and an ending that is difficult to swallow. But if you're looking for grandeur, spectacle, huge sets, beautiful costumes, an almost perfect/printine transfer to DVD, and a chariot race and fight between the stars, Stephen Boyd and Christopher Plummer, that rivals the chariot race in Ben Hur, then this is your movie. However, I would appreciate someone explaining to me how James Mason could be torchered extensively by the barbarion, John Ireland, by fire, apparently on his left side or left hand, and not show any signs of it in the following scenes."
4,A Classic,"This is not so great movie but still enjoyable.At last available in a DVD with decent picture and sound, along with mind blowing extras. This limited collector's edition comes with 1 additional booklet and few art cards. Even though I purchased the Limited Edition, I feel like the goodies not worth the additional money I paid. Also the box will eat up more space in your DVD rack. So buying theThe Fall Of The Roman Empire (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) (The Miriam Collection)will be a good deal. I highly recommend this along with .El Cid (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) (The Miriam Collection)to any classic DVD collection"
3,Tricky title.,"The best of this DVD are the extras. I hoped, by the title, the last moments of the roman empire in the fifth century A.D., but is an interpretation of one of many causes of the collapse of the empire, the begining of fool emperors at the end of the second century A.D., with Comodous. This film has the same historical fiction than ""Gladiator""."
3,Excellent historic performance,"This, as Stephen Boyd said, ""one of the best movies of its kind"". It is suberb in the first part, during the life of Marcus Aurelius(Alec Guinness), but does not develop too well later. Still it is a great spectacle, even if not free of the preaching of modern morality which is foreign to the world depicted in the film."
5,The Fall of the Roman Empire,"This is one of the greatest and underrated film epics of all time. To match the visuals of this spectacle it has one of the most intelligent scripts containing depth and wit far beyond anything seen for this genre. The cinematography is just splendid and dramatically progresses the story (after all, film is a visual medium). The action sequences are remarkably moving and impressively staged. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is rich and evocative for a yearning of Rome's once greatness and its inevitable future. The cast and their performances are equal to its superlative production values includes: Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christopher Plumber, Anthony Quail, John Ireland, Mel Ferrer, Omar Sharif and Andrew Keri. Guinness and Mason demonstrate their profundity for outstanding acting abilities. (I was taken aback when I saw ""Gladiator"" recently and found that it was a retelling, albeit a different story, of this epic)."
2,All That Money Can Buy,"I'm sorry, but in spite of a stellar cast, lavish set design, glittering costumes and 1000's of extras, this is just one big, long yawn. Don't get me wrong, I love Quo Vadis, Gladiator, Ben Hur, The Robe, Spartacus, and Demetrius and the Gladiators, but this one is a flop. I can't understand why so many folks rave on about it. The music is all wrong, and the slow paced script and wooden dialogue obviously failed to inspire the actors, which is a pity because many of them were the best we have ever seen. The DVD's themselves are great, the excellent extras are far more interesting than the film itself. Save your money and buy the other ones I've listed . . ."
2,Fall of the Roman Empire,"It is a great movie when I saw it when it first came out: BUT this BLY-RAY isonly to be seen on a REG ""B"" player, and I did not see it in the promo that itwill only play on Reg ""B"" which Amazon may have left out?Was it a mistake on sending the wrong type or was I not looking in the rightplace before I purchased this procuct?By the way it did get here on the 16th of July, which was great, but sorry tosay,- I will not be able to see it on the 19th of July my birthday!SHAME ON YOU ALL!?! ORIS IT SHAME ON ME!?!No rating I have seen the movie, Blu ray yet."
1,Where is the DVD version ??,"As with El Cid, I was anticipating the release of ""Fall of.."" on a remastered and widescreen DVD release during April of this year. Now the release of this movie has been postponed or withdrawn, with no explanation. I have seen a DVD version of this movie being sold on EBay. It seems to have been pressed in the Far East and is being sold as a new DVD in a sealed package. The one star rating is for the poor quality VHS pan & scan version being sold. Note: AMC cable has run a pretty good widescreen version of this film and one that I have recorded, but I am waiting for a DVD version."
5,I love this book!,"I love this book! I think because Cindy Crawford has so much experience with the world of beauty that she cuts through all the bull, and gets to basic stuff if you want to wear make-up but do not want to look like a floozy. Plus, she gives great tips on buying makeup, using makeup, etc. She gives unvarnished but very helpful advice. It is the best book I have seen on beauty tips. Plus the pictures and silver cover are cool too. I am surprised it is not on shelves anymore. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't know what they are doing when it comes to makeup."
1,Not worth a Peanut,"This looks like it is a greatest hits disc, but it is a live recording done in Quebec with a lackluster quintet. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! The song list looks like it would be a greatest hits of Dizzy, but there are many other better offerings. This is not for the 10 CD set. It is for the single disc ""Salt Peanuts"". Amazon stupidly applied this review to the 10 CD set."
5,Bulldog review,This is the 4th one of the RS1100 I have installed. All worked as advertised. The item ordered was shipped promptly and arrived new and in the original manufacturers sealed box. Would definitely buy from Amazon.com again.
1,disappointed,I was so disappointed in this movie. I thought it was going to be really good and it wasn't. I couldn't wait for it to end. I wish I would have just rented it.
5,Slammed-Full of Marketing Information!! A must read.,A whole marketing planning course into 200 pages! I am a MBA who was required to read this. This should be required reading for anyone in business - students and professionals. It covers everything from Competitor Analysis to Market Potential and Forecasting. You can become a marketing guru in less than a week.
3,Verify the needed adapter,"Mixed impressions. Some shots went out really good, some others not so well. First verify you have the needed adapter for in my case it was not included to I had to adquire it separately. Some pictures comes out with a blue tint in the objects borders (specially in bright natural light). It does have a sweet spot you need to find since not all zoom factors of the camera produce good shots with it. Auto focus tends to not work when using this lens so you are better off focusing manually. I do not recommend to use it with the camera built in flash since the adapter gets in the middle and generates a wide shadow (although I think it's a flaw of the Z1012 itself since it has the flash atop the middle). Not for every shot you take but it can help in some situations."
3,The good and the bad,"This is a nice little telephoto, as well as my first. Right off the bat after unwrapping it, i noticed it had some weight to it. But once its on my Kodak Z812 with the adapter tube, holding around the lens grip area it doesn't feel to heavy at all. After taking some pictures, you notice right away if your shooting anything lower then 1/500 or so, you will get a halo effect around your subject (Fixable by using a tripod) as well as you have to crop a fairly large section of the edges out since the lens seems to ""Pull"" some of the picture and distort it. All and all id give it a 3/5 *'s Good cheap start on using telephoto lens."
5,Great product U.S.A.,Great product that works flawlessly compared to cheaply made counterparts of this style. Costs about the same at the tin scissor version that has less durability or the common bending they are famous for. Even comes with the organizer for the tool box. Just can't go wrong with quality products that don't fall apart after one job or in the middle of changing out a part.
5,I actually first heard Great Big Sea on a fishing boat...,"...and I instantly fell in love with the music. From the upeat, riotous traditional tunes (during which you would be crazy if you could sit still), to the moving ballads to the beautiful a capella harmonies...I have never heard anything like them. The songs will stick in your head and you will enjoy it! This was my first GBS album, and soon i hope to have them all. It was definitely worth paying the extra money for the import charges to have PLAY!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money For This Brief Book,"I was extrememly disappointed with this book altogether. I am taking a phlebotomy course and have been sharing a classmates book ""Phlebotomy Essentials,"" since mine is not even satisfactory. It is a very brief text and does not even include the important Laboratory/Test Medical Terminology and abbreviations, such as BUN, GTT, etc... I would definately not suggest this book for a National Exam study guide. Sorry I wasted my money and now have to pay extra to get the right book for my needs."
2,An all time low,This book's only good characters were Swartt and Veil. Sunflash was the most stupidest badger of them all. He was invincible in the book and that ruined about everything. The woodlanders were just rip-offs of past Redwall characters but some parts were good.
2,the outcast of redwall,"i believe that the outcast of redwall was a lousy book,but many people do love it.i only suggest reading this book if u like novels where they skip around from character to character throughout the whole book,i find this annoying,some people might like it though."
3,Not so great.,"This book was too predictable, since it has the same plot as most of the other Redwall stories. Had some interesting action, but the ending was kinda weird..."
2,Not the best book....,"This book, to me, isn't the best book. Why? Because the title said the outcast of redwall, (Which is Veil by the way.) but it really just tells the story about Sunflash, a badger-lord. I wish they told the child-hood of Veil more, and less about the badger. I also didn't like the ending. If you like the redwall books, then go ahead read it. But check it out from a libary first, before you buy it."
5,Jacques @ His Best,"I have read almost all The (original) REDWALL series and The Outcast of Redwall was very engaging. I have read it twice. I think others should have the same experience. you should also read: Redwall, Martin the Warrior, Mariel of Redwall, The Bellmaker, and The pearls of lutra"
5,Review:,"The eighth installment of the famed Redwall series gives a far darker look at the land of Mossflower. Unlike many of Jacques' other books where the major evil confronts the major good, The Outcast of Redwall holds the suspense of the reader with the question of whether or not Viel Sixclaw will turn upon those who reared him from a cub, or turn his back on the evil who is his father, Swartt Sixclaw. Like all Jacques' books, there are many different characters who always seem to come together in a large show-down in the end. In this story, the other groups are Sunflash the Mace, and Bryony the mousemaid who raised Viel. Sunflash is the sworn enemy of Viel's father, Swartt Sixclaw. This violent, mutual hatred greatly effects the lives of all creatures involved. While not as good as Jaques' Mattimeo, Mossflower, or Pearls of Lutra, this book is a good addition to the Redwall Series, and a needed deviation from the norm of Jacquesian novels."
4,"Good, But not the best","This was a good book, but I like Pearls of Lutra best. This book takes a long time to get into. I generally agree with the reivews that other people gave."
5,amazing and asonishing book with a gread ending,i have read ever jacques books and this was the first one i read. the ending was unpredictaible and characters are great! if you are a redwall fan read this book!!!!
3,Not enough on the character in the title...,"In ""Outcast of Redwall"", Brian Jacques didn't really focus on the character that was mentioned in the title. The story is more focused on Sunflash the Badger Lord, instead of on the actual Outcast of Redwall, Veil. Don't get me wrong though, the writing is great and the battle scenes are both moving and amazing, but he just needed to give a little bit more on how Veil's life progressed."
2,Good concept - Poor follow through,This is the first novel I have read in the Redwall series and it was an upset. I could not tell if this book was for adults or children? The book could have been a mesmerizing battle of good and evil but the story was padded with too much cheese. Why do I have to know everything these creatures eat for dinner anyway? The concept of Redwall seems very interesting but if the other books are similar to this one I will not hold my breath.
2,150 pages into the book and CD missing images in tutorial.,"I wish someone would go through these books first to see if all the images and tutorial items are complete with the instructions. I did a ""find file"" on the very first image I was told to open..in the mosaics tutorial..Guitar.jpg, only to find it is not on the CD. So I go to my collection of photos and get one of my own. Then the next tutorial I have to swap CD's to the Painter CD to use one of the images provided on it. I will never get this learning process underway if I can't find images and have to keep changing CD's. Sorry for the strong critique, but I am 50 yrs. old and don't have a lot of time to fiddle around all day swapping and searching..I am trying to acomplish some learning!"
4,"Great puzzles, but cheap presentation","I had this book when I was a kid, and I remember loving it. The puzzles are exactly as awesome as I remember, but I didn't realise this was a paperback reissue instead of the original hardcover."
1,EXPIRED PRODUCT,"THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF OUR MONEY--the product was all dried up and did nothing on my duaghter;s hair...then I pulled the packet out of the trash and saw it was months beyond its ""USE BY"" date. VERY DISAPPOINTED and will never order from them again!"
1,A complete ripoff,"I can't believe we're so busy we were deceived by this ripoff. Real San Marzano tomatoes are imported. These are not, but are marketed so that you would think so if you did not read the entire label. Shame on them!"
1,NOT DOP San Marzano Tomatoes-Buyer Beware,"In order to get REAL San Marzano tomatoes, make sure to buy the ones marked DOP which is a government ""seal of approval"" basically. This brand is terrible, not even close to San Marzanos."
1,Only worked once,"After some difficulty the software worked to pull data off an old Motorola phone. I have continuously updated the software during the allowed 6 months after purchase.I try to connect my new LG phone and it can't find it. I have followed all troubleshooting instructions, and installed the drivers, tried 2 phones.The software has excellent packaging, a lot of desirable features, if only they would work."
1,Very frustrating product - no support,"I hate to say but I am very frustrated with this product and support is nonexistent. We purchased the enterprise unlimited edition and have found MANY phones are not supported. For 3 days I have been trying to update the software hoping that would solve our problems. But the product will not let me update unless it is registered on the web. When I try to do that I am told the serial number is wrong. The serial number is VERY difficult to read on our edition and when I called I was given a key to validate over the phone but that is not enough to update the home. I have opened two trouble tickets, and left a phone message and have not heard back."
3,HOLLOW,I have read some of the reviews and some of ya'll are faking. This game is a MAJOR let down.First off the good stuff... nice graphics.. pretty good roster of players...and great tricks..and some kinda ok locales.Now the bad stuff. While this game does have a good roster I can;t help but feel slighted at how few players are in this game!!! Where are the legends for petes sake??!!... now i kno americans wouldn't kno who Jurgen klinsman or Carlos valederama are but the rest of the world DOES and we want them as well as others in the game!!!And there are other players in the world that can be considered starz ya kno if there is a part 2... i want MUCH mor players in there. Also this game feels rished out the gate 2 cash in on nba and nfl streets success ...if u feel nfl street was rushed stay faaar away from this game!!!And the announcer!! YUCK!
2,Disappointing,"This is an older video as the color shows. I found the production to be slow and unengaging. No doubt it has some historical value, but it did not hold my attention."
1,F'****ing s**t,"I dont have word to describe how terrible this season review is!!!! Jesus Chrisst, the guys who edited this must have been Scouser's for sure!"
4,Not as dark as it looks,"I bought these as a birthday gift for my mother-in-law who has almost every red kitchen accessory and appliance you can think of. When I saw these I knew she would love them, and she does. The handles are nicely sized and balanced so that the utensil doesn't cut into the side of your hand like thinner ones do, and they have held up to (hand)washing for 2 months with no trouble. My only complaint is that they are a brighter red than shown in the picture, more of almost a faded maraschino cherry red instead of the darker red I was expecting. Either way she loves them and that's what matters!"
5,red silverware,Good weight. Color as pictured. Arrived well packaged and quickly. Brings a nice bit of color to the table. I have another set of these in blue which have been in use for about ten years. No problems!
4,good anthology,"This horror-science fiction anthology consists of thirty-four for the most part ultra short stories (mean average length is 4.2 pages) that are predominantly written by Eric S. Brown as D. Richard Pearce contributes two solos and three collaborations. The tales run the gamut of horror and science fiction from A (angels) to Z (zombies) with plenty of supernatural and alien stops in between. The bloodsuckers bring a new meaning to ""Family"" while Zombies display how high the price of gas can become and tyro Demons attend ""Hells Daycare. Most of the stories are well written, but in this minuscule format no character develops beyond their front fangs. Overall a solid cross section of the two genres, MADMEN'S DREAM is a fine collection though at times readers will believe longer formats would have suited the contribution like the ""Underdweller"" and ""Last One Standing"".Harriet Klausner"
5,Great resource for Chinese dragons!,"A Time of Golden Dragons tells the story of the Chinese dragon's history and legends, its role in celebrations, and its image as a zodiac sign. Dragons are miraculous creatures, often helpful, which are said to embody parts of many animals - deer, camel, serpent, frog, fish, tiger, eagle and ox. This book explains celebrations such as the Dragon Boat race, the symbolism of being born in the sign of the dragon, and representations of dragons in ancient and modern times. This is a colorful and educational book for anyone who is fascinated by Chinese dragons."
3,liquid band-aids,"The product came on time and in the condition promised. I was dissppointed in the productitself, however. It didn't seem to do the job as well as my prior tube had. I don'tknow if anything was altered in the formula or not, but it just didn't last very long,and I don't think that I'd buy it again."
3,I'm not a fan of poetry...,"So, my rating doesn't count BUT if you used some of the poetry from the notebook you showed me I'm sure you'll have a solid fan base as your poetry lightly reminded me of the late Jim Morrison. Therefore I rated it 50/50, 3 stars. I may have seen 50% of the work from your notebook and for poetry, it was better than anything I've read beyond Morrison's poetry.Good luck! Please do the world a favor and publish ""About a Girl"". I still can't believe you wrote such a colorful ""John Cusak love story"" type novella in that short time period. The ""stories"" within the book humor me to this day. I still open it now and then for a chuckle.It would make a great movie. If John Cusak were still young, he'd definitely star as you. That's the problem...who would be cast as the lead role....Anyway, I hope this book of poetry ends up in a college English class 20 years from now."
3,Good toy,"I love the Leap Frog bus-but this one was not the one I expected. When you push the letters of the alphabet, it only tells you what the letter is. It does not have the option on the bus to change the mode so that when you press the letter, you instead hear the sound that letter makes. It also does not have the option to change the mode to music, where a different song plays with each letter you push. I was so disappointed this was not the exact version of the bus I expected."
3,Dock 'N' Talk Digital Speaker Phone adaptor #42549-202,"I purchased two of the subject systems and was pleased with the quality of the sound provided. They were superior to other off the shelf hands free systems I tried.Unfortunately, the phone connector that attached to the phone and included the built-in microphone was too fragile and both had ""posts"" to assist in securing the connector to the phone. In both of my adaptors, one of the posts broke and therefore the connector will not stay in the phone.It would be nice if the connectors could be replaced; any suggestions?"
2,Regretful Purchase,"At daycare, my son loves this old beat up magna doodle with a worn magnet pen and one circle shape left. My husband purchased this toy thinking that this one had all the bells and whistles. Unfortunately, the dry erase markers are terribly messy and DO NOT erase!! So we are left with a magnet pen and stencils. My advice is do not waste your money on the bells and whistles, the original has obviously stood the test of time!"
2,Not too happy,I purchased this CD under the impression that it was all instrumental music - WRONG! Interspersed with rather lovely renditions of classical favorites -- perfect for bringing a baby to sleepyland -- are painfully perky upbeat vocal variations on a few traditional lullabies that have a tendancy to jar a baby awake! Rather antithetical to the purpose.
1,Female vox; ends w/ 30min of instrumentals,"The first ten tracks are w/ female vocals (and chime-y synthesizers).After that, there is about 30min of instrumental music -- calm lullaby themes played over a background of rushing water.The one-star rating is for adults -- the arrangements are all very sweet (saccharine), and it's not something I'd want to listen to repeatedly. [Then again, my tastes include industrial and goth music.] I don't have any children though; this might be just the ticket for getting an infant to sleep while also familiarizing them with some classic children's songs."
2,It Helps if You Turn Off the Sound,One of the most addle-brained movies I've ever encountered. But I could watch Mischa Barton all day long.
5,this movie was awsom,"this move is about a bank robbery, its not planned. two kids just feel like doing this. then it all slowly comes togeather and the thrill from this movie will leave you amazed at the storys whole plot. the ending was bad but there probably were beter ones"
1,No words could describe how terrible this movie is.,"I was 14 years old when I saw this movie, and it was about the same age as the two main characters. Basically what it's about is two kids rob a bank wow very exciting. ''Stevie'' finds a hand gun and with his girlfriend Rocky they rob a bank. The two 13 year olds go into a bank with a hand gun and force everyone to the floor and so on, nothing new you've seen it all before. What gets to me about this movie is that all they had to do was tackle this kid and take the gun away. The acting (stunk) and I can't believe Burt would do this movie. Now this movie is great....for laughs. They try and be dramatic but it's really a comendy to me. The ending was so cheezy they tried to make it a tear-jerker and it worked I cried! I cried because I was laughing so hard. This should be the voted the worst movie of all time but at the same time it should be voted the FUNNIEST movie of all time!"
2,No Thrill In this Victory,This is the most unrealistic senario I have ever read. A journalist spends a lifetime making fun of a tennis star. Then all of a sudden get a conscience when she has a tumor. Then this same journalist spirited her away from press. Not only is the plot plausible at best. but for the sex scenes this is a very boring book...
3,Didn't work for me,Slow start and a little confusing. (First four chapters took place in the same place.) Story just didn't move. Dialogue seemed cliche and was mixed with lots of thoughts from both of them. Plot seemed see-through and just didn't grab me.
4,Good ACE book,"ACE becomes popular in the world of system programming these years because of it's portability, low difficulty by providing wrapper encapsulating the complexity of low-level thread usage. However, going on development on ACE without thorough knowledges of system level details is hazardous and therefore further readings are recommended.(e.g. Hart's book)"
1,Not Happy,"This book is very misleading, and it is nothing what I thought it would be. I was very disappointed when I received it. The book is just what the bride and groom say to each other, at a wedding. I thought the book was going to be more spiritual and talk about the marriage in a different light, but it does not talk about it like that it just states the vows the husband and wife take. This is the last time I purchase a book I am unable to ""look inside"" before I purchase Not Happy"
2,No No,Just not enough instruction / illustration. But I suppose it would work for some who can read between lines. I don't have that talent.
4,Good introductory indoor bonsai book,"As stated in the title this book is about indoor bonsai, or more precisely how to grow and maintain tropical bonsai indoors. It doesn't contain much info on non tropical species, which are more appropriate to growing outdoors. There are many beautiful pictures that will inspire the beginning bonsai artist to create masterpieces of their own. Highly recommended beginners book."
4,Charlie Chan lover,These Charlie Chan DVD's do not have as many scenes cut out as when you see them on TV. I am very pleased with them.
3,Great Set....BUT......NOT Restored or Remastered..!!!!,"All 4 of these Charlie Chan movies are classics and it's high time that the studios stopped being ""politically correct"" and released these great movies. I hope the studio will release more. There is one caveat to my recommendation.....these are good quality prints BUT not restored or remastered and for those movie buffs with big screen TV's they are a disappointment. The picture can be darker than normal and the clarity is not what it should be if these had been properly restored. If you want to see what a really good restoration looks like buy the new and restored John Wayne movie ""The Searchers"".....this is how it should be done. When are the studios going to learn to restore and remaster these fine old movies so they can be really enjoyed on the big screen TV..???"
3,Great set but poor restoration,"No argument about the content of this set....the Warner Oland Charlie Chan films are great and long overdue from Fox on DVD. The digital restoration has largely solved the issues of film artifacts, however it has introduced way too much graininess into the images. It's downright distracting and in many respects worse than the problem they were trying to solve. If one wants to see how it should be done, look at the recently issued Sherlock Holmes Collection. The results on that set are superb."
4,Chan Collection Vol. 1,"In the past I have recorded Charlie Chan movies from tv. I have worn the tapes out.So to have them on cd is the best. It's nice to know that someone cared enough to put these classic films on disc. I am not happy with the quality of the Chan in Egypt. It is grainy, and too light. Something I didn't have with my copies from tv. Overall the set is good and I would say if you are an old film buff, buying these sets is worth the money. I will be buying more in the future."
1,Awful!,The voice of the english lady singing is annoying. I listened to three songs and would have thrown it out the car window if nobody was around. Waste of money.
5,Excellent choice in a Push Reel Mower! It handles like a dream!,"I was very excited when we got this product and wanted to give it a try! My husband usually handles mowing the yard, but this was so easy to push and did a very neat job! Previous Push Reel Mowers did a bad job at cutting the grass evenly."
1,Found the Sunlawn 16-Inch Mower to be poor,"I have a small lawn, 620 square feet, that I mow twice a week and a manual reel mower is just right for me--if it worked. It worked good enough for about 3 months and then it started making a rachteting noise that I just thought was the wheels were just trying to synchronize their clutches. Today, I realized that the noise for the past 8 months is a failed clutch in the left wheel making it trying to mow with just the other wheel pulling. Many times I have to mow two ways to eliminate the chopped pattern of the cut grasss from the reel not turning fast enough because of the left wheel slipping.In summary, this is a poorly made mower, is too light to get traction to turn the blade to cut well even with both wheels working, and is way over priced."
1,Waste of time and money,I purchased this mower to cut a small narrow yard that runs alongside my driveway. What a joke. It can't really handle much of anything. It only takes a tiny bit of grass to jam up the mechanism and bring this mower to a screeching halt. It does a lousy job of actually cutting blades of grass. Probably rips out more grass then it cuts. You'll have to go over the same area numerous times to get a level cut. In the past I've purchased two other manual mowers from local hardware stores that cost half as much money as this unit and both worked much better than this. I got so frustrated with it yesterday I actually used my weed wacker to mow my lawn. This is a very disappointing/overpriced product.
4,"Good but not groundbreaking, its over.","The era, feel and damage that west coast gangsta rap brought to the industry is all over. Don't get me wrong, the cd is blazing. But considering how powerful this crew was, and the current climate in rap, you know that it will never be the same."
5,Classic,"This album was stolen from my Jeep (along with multiple others) a number of years ago. I missed it and re-ordered it recently from Amazon, great memories were brought back to life as soon as I pressed play. Dre's ""2001"" comeback is classic!"
2,2 stars for 2 good songs,"I have been waiting for this cd since 1992 when the original Chronic came out. I have to admit that I got caught up in the hype surrounding this release. Dre has changed his style, moving from meter and rhyme to Chronic 2001's disjointed, ""I have too many words to say in this song"" style. I was disappointed, and I think that deep-down, most would agree with me, despite all the 5 star ratings. I would have given this a 5 star rating if there were some hard-hitting beats, but frankly, almost all of the songs are slow grooves. There is too much funk and not enough hip-hop.This cd sounds like something that should have come out 25 years ago.Still Dre and Murder Inc (with the Halloween movie theme) are the only good songs."
2,Not worth the money.. sorry Dre,"I've been a fan of Dr. Dre since NWA, the Chronic, Dogg Pound, California Love, etc... I NEVER NEVER forgot about Dre......this album leaves me wishing I did. The first day I bought this CD I was jamming the hell out of it. I thought it was the best CD ever! how long ago was that? lets just say I haven't listened to it since December, 2000. This cd has none of the longevity dre's other cds had... that's because Dre recorded this one so fast.I've always enjoyed Dre... but this CD... PRODUCTION, GUESTS and DRE HIMSELF are weak... I give it two stars for the two good songs ""Still DRE"" and ""forgot about Dre"".. other than that.. this CD stinks"
5,Dre's best ever,buy this album now i have had this cd about 2 months and it's the best cd on the market
1,Dr. Dre threw his creativity out the window thanks to this.,"The Chronic 2001 is one of the worst dr. dre albums ever produced, this is another reason why dr. dre hasn't been the same since he left death row, the production is not as good as it was in the chronic from 1992, although there are a few good songs, but the rest is just godawful, he started paving way for feminem (aka the most overrated rapper of all time) and other stuff to come.It was the major downfall of his career.(Notice the napster thing)Sorry Dr. Dre you are no longer my favorite producer of all time, in fact you been no longer since 1996Just Blaze takes that spot now.Dr. Dre has sold out and forgot about his long time fansIf you want a real dr. dre album, pick up the chronic."
1,Too explicit,"Another person who sometimes has access to my account bought this song, I did not personally purchase this song and don't appreciate the explicit nature of it."
4,best thing about this album?,"this isnt the best album in the world, but its good. dre is good, eminem is good, the beats are tight and the lyrics down right....but the best thing about this album....its not CMR or No Limit...im so tired of the same ole nonsence coming out of these brothas mouth...sounds like they dropped out of elementary school to make an album.. dre can stand on his own, be entertaining, and make sence all at the same time...."
4,great Cd,"If your a Dre fan this is for you. If it where anyone else besides dre I would have given it a five, but Dr Dre could have done better, so I was a bit disipointed in dre, but he is way better than most of these rappers."
4,Rap white guys like,This was the first Rap CD to really catch my ear and turn me onto a style of music I thought wasn't for me. Dre knows what we all want to hear and he gives to us ten fold on this disc.
5,What I Thought Of Dr Dre 2001,"This Album is wicked. This Is One Of My Favorite Albums It Has Some Wicked Tracks Like Forgot About Dre Feating Eminem, What's The Difference Feating Xzibit and Eminem And The Next Episode Feating Snoop Dogg And Nate Dogg.Get It."
4,I never forgot about Dre either!,"Yep, this is one fly album, full respect to Dr. Dre. The first few songs in particular are f'in amazing! Unfortunately i couldn't give it 5 stars cos' i think itz 'one of those albums' where the songs start off tha lick but a lot gradually turn not AS good as tha first nuff swingin' ones. Forgot about Dre. iz a dark song though, respect 2 Dre n Eminem 4 that!Definately buy this though. I can't wait till the NWA get back together too, if they do. I reckon they will. PEACE!"
1,Not his best work because he ignores his classical roots!,"I acquired this CD expecting a return to the rmoantically-inspired strains of his early 1990's effort ""The Chronic."" Regrettably, after several listenings, I fail to identify many of the more interesting variations on avowedly inspirational artists like Elgar, Brahms, and Wagner on Dr. Dre's work. As most people reading this review will already know, ""Dr."" Dre received his doctorate in music theory at Yale, to follow up his earlier work in cello performance at Oberlin. At both schools, his writing emphasized the darker romantics, with a smattering of more recent composers. These influences were obvious (with the obligatory ""rap"" spin) on the ""Straight Outta Compton collaboration again, through ""The Chronic"" (particularly, see ""Rollin' in My 6-4 as an obvious example). NONE of this is evidenced in the new work, although Dr. Dre does identify Beethoven's love of ""Explicit Lyrics."""
4,The beats make this album.....,"Truly, the only one that comes off nice lyrically is Eminem. But the beats are very good. Mostly every song has a very good beat, Dre is an amazing producer but isn't, and never will be an outstanding MC. But the album is very good....."
2,Whack....,"You gotta give this man his props for creativity... and his production skills appear to have sharpened, minus the ""Death Row"" influence. Actually, I think this is a very nice album. I gave it two stars just to get yall attention! Slick, huh? Compared to his first, the beats are more mellow, allowing listeners to focus in on lyrics. What you will hear is a smooth Dr. Dre sound that anyone can vibe to. My favorite... gotta give it up for: ""track #17"" featuring several of his talented guest. I don't know, I grew up in LA, and when listening to track 17 as I roll thru the ATL, I almost feel as if I'm back at the crib, rolling down central on my way to get my grub on at taco pete's! But hey, like the song says, and it's true, ""LA brothers are all over the world."""
2,OVERRATED,"this cd is ok, at that, i give it 2 stars because there are only 3 great songs, forget about dre, still dre, and the next episode, the rest of the songs are bad or just ok, if u you want some REAL rap, go check out some Dmx, Lox, or nelly, they make me forget about dre."
5,A Great Dre CD,"""2001"" is probably the best Cd that ive ever heard.All of the tracks have good beats and lyrics.The only thing that i dont like are the two or three interludes on the Cd.Other than that,this is a great Cd to buy."
5,a great memory of his rappin days,"Dr dre is one of the greatest,if not the best rappers as shown by this cd. He has sick beats through out this album like the songs the watcher,still dre,forgotbout dre, the nextepisode, xplosive,actrite n some others. He also has every song made with great lyrics n chorus that r 100 times beeter then some of these rappers now adays. DRE may be done wit rappin but this album is a great memory of wen he was still totaly in the game. THis n the chronic n his nwa albums r a way 2 c dre's full potenitial."
5,chronic 2001 definitely brings the true flavor of the D.R.E.,"From the opening intro with Dre on the switches to the reminiscence of his homies with Mary J. Blige, Dr. Dre fulfills the long awaited anticipation with his sophmore album 2001. Dre's melodic beats and westcoast rhythms grab your ear from start to finish. With him teaming up with the dogg pound, eminem, and bringing out hitman and six-two, this will be remembered as one of the best follow-up albums since Outkast's ATLiens. IT IS A MUST HAVE. KNOW ABOUT IT. FEEL IT."
3,It's no Chronic but it's ok,"This album is about half full of interludes and fillers, but it's still tight enough. It didn't have what the Chronic had though. My list of top tracks on this album are in order as follows: Forgot About Dre(of course), What's the difference, Bang Bang, f you, Still Dre, Big Ego's and Murder Ink. Snoop and Eminem rip it up as always while other's are a little stale and sound exhausted. It's no chronic but it's ok"
3,He's back.....or is he?,"Dr. Dre left the rap game a king, and comes back to claim his thrown...but he has a fight on his hands. Dre returns with classic beats and fresh rhymes, but he seems a little lost. No doubt though, dre is a master of his profession, dominatin every track over bass-heavy beat. This disc is a must to every dre fan...but it leaves me to wonder if he was holdin somtin back on this one."
1,"If there was no star, i d take this one!","After a week or even less i could no longer listen to this album..at the beginning i thought how great it was, but now i even zap when there are clips of da dr on TV becos its getting sooo boring after a short period of time...its incredible...i can only recommend u to NOT buy this album...what did happen to DRE?"
3,these are not heavy weight,These skewers are not as heavy weight as I had hoped. They are easily bent and don't feel as if they will hold up long with moderate use.
3,"C'mon , I was hoping for better !","After reading about the movie on the back of the dvd I went in with high expectations. The plot concept sounded very interesting and so I watched the entire movie. Even though the concept of the plot was good the director didn't take advantage of the great potential this movie could have offered its viewers. The teenage boy ( her love interest ) wasn't believable to me and his personality in this film was distracting. Over the phone he was confident , rude , and called her by her first name. In person he was nervous , kinda shy , and somewhat of a nerd. The sex scenes were unnesssary and contrived . The problem with this movie was the disjointed plot scenes that made the movie feel rushed. I felt like there were too many unanswred questions in this movie and i wasn't happy with the ending. I really don't like open ended movies like that. I think most people prefer to have some idea what is happening ,etc. Oh well."
4,tough but effective,"I am not a mechanic or an electrician, but I am knowledgable in both subjects. I installed two of these units myself and they work great. They are VERY difficult to install yourself. Most cars require you buy additional security bypass units, so call the manufacturer and make sure you have all the parts before you start the project."
5,Available in UK,This excellent book is not out of print! It is available through Amazon.co.uk in both hardback and paperback. It is an excellent read and a must for anybody in the service sector.
2,Shipping,I ordered this book on February 1. I just discovered that it just shipped out today February 7. That is not a very expeditous shipping policy. I have a friend that bought the very same book on the 31st of Jan. and she got it on Feb. 4th. She also bought it on Amazon. What is up with this ridiculous snail pace shipping????????
5,INCREDIBLE ¡¡,"GREAT ¡¡ The best of Megadeth is righ here ¡¡ official versions,rarities and DVD awsome show in London '92 ...to new fans or who's not know it... high ""dosis"" of greatest thrash metal band... MEGADETH ¡¡HIGH RECOMMENDABLE ¡¡"
2,hummm kinda the same,the songs are all the same from his lone sundowner album... kinda weak ...for i am a big fan of sundowner as well as lawrence arms ... jus wish he would come out with some new stuff...
5,Excellent Readings providing womens' contexts to history,"Hewitt's Women, Families and Communities provides an excellent survey showing important female contributions to American culture and history. Yes it has open ended questions. History is not merely names dates and issues. Any student of history who thinks that all answers are definitive misunderstands the historical dialogue. Hewitt provides questions which can guide the student in developing analytical skills in discussing the readings. I have used this text in several survey courses and female students who could not relate to the top down male dominated history frequently covered in primary texts, came to life in discussing these readings. This book of readings will not provide a comprehensive history, not even a comprehensive women's history. It does provide contextual resources which, when used with a primary text, provides insights into everyday life, family life and the significant role of women throughout America's history"
5,Doodlebops rock!,My 3 and 4 yr old grand-daughters love the Doodlebops!!! I am so glad that I have found these videos!!
3,"Christian historical fiction, a bit pulpy","This series is a fairly ""pulpy"" but quite clean love story cum adventure story a la Indiana Jones. It is moral without being spiritually deep. (I have a problem that all the Jews in the story seem to believe in the Messiah-hood of Jesus, as do many of the Arabs, unless they are maniac terrorists.) It's historically interesting, but the series progresses maddeningly slowly. There are neat references in each book's prelude to scenes at the Fall of the Temple in about 70 AD which link to scenes in the 20th century story of the formation of Israel. Impossible adventure sequences abound. This series is, however, much better written than the ""prequel"" series written more recently by the same author. Overall, my reaction to the Zion Chronicles series is mixed."
1,Don't waste your money,"This ""book"" does not shed any new information on NetWare 6. It's nothing more than an overview of NetWare 6 features that you can get from Novell's web site. What a waste."
5,Funny and Enjoyable for SpongeBob Fans!,"I received this game for Christmas a few years ago and loved it as soon as I started playing it. The game has Granny 3D graphics in it, which make the game look really good. There are eight chapters, each one consisting of a main task to be completed before moving on. There are a lot of different things to click on and/or interact with. The game starts in SpongeBob's house, where you have to help him get ready for his soon-to-be-crushed dreams of being manager. Throughout the game, you can play as several other characters, which are Plankton, Mindy, and Patrick. The characters' voices in the game are from the actual SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which make the game even more fun to play. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves SpongeBob and the rest of the games."
3,Who Wants to See it in 3D? I do.,"This is a realy good game. It was impressive how the 3D Granny engine did it. They didn't do it fully in 3D!! If you'd like to see the pineapple and Bikini Bottom in 3D, this game isn't for you. Plus, you can't move with the controller or keyboard!! You have to click the stupid mouse to move him. The conversation is much like the TV show by Viacom. The game is much like the movie, at 95%. Here are my Ratings:Gameplay-8Sound-9Graphics-8.5Other-7Overall-8.2/10My Critic Rating-3/5"
3,Doesn't live up to it's hype.,"The book didn't really give me any insight in how to transform legacy code to modern oop. The examples were ok but considering I bought this based on other reviews I figured it was great. It's not. Of the 30,000 lines of code I inherited in my first perl script, I may have refered to this book one time. Don't expect much help in modernizing, just seems to focus of figuring out bad code not refactoring. Maybe I'll use it as I update other scripts but for now it sits well under perl by example and camel 2nd ed."
4,Excellent,"This cartoon was excellent! I really enjoyed it when I was younger, but unfortunetly, I haven't seen it for years and years.I have wonderful memories, from this japanese anime cartoon, but only have small glimpes of the film in my mind...Overall the cartoon was gorgeous. I haven't seen it anywhere..."
3,I agree with naz's review,overall the last game was better than this new one the fighting in my opinion feels glitchy and i feel the game doesnt run as smooth as the last one although the graphics have improved thats not enough to make me like this one more than the first ...id wait till the price drops on this one if your still interested in buying anyways..because over all its still an ok game
4,CD/Radio Caller ID Phone,"I like the product. It is a space saver. The only flaw I found in it is that if someone is using a second phone in the house and they hang up, the phone mutes as if someone had picked it up. Other than that the sound quality is great and I really love it."
5,Good customer service,"I received this book with some of the pages cut out. Why anyone would do that to a book is beyond me. Perhaps for a ransom note? Hint: use a newspaper next time, it's less likely to be traced.So I contacted the seller and within 24 hours, I was given a refund, no questions asked. This was great customer service, and I will be using this seller again.The book itself was typical Ann Rule, a bit dry but factual. I've been on a binge reading her novels lately and can tell while she empathizes with the victims, she tries to present an unbiased case, with all the data. Not an easy task.She seems like a cool lady and I'd love to meet her some day."
3,okay book,"i thought the first half of the book was good but then it was slow towards the middle and it was getting a little hard to stay focused on reading it. it picked up again towards the end, so i would say it was an okay book overall, but nothing to get too excited about."
5,Another great book by Ann Rule,No one tells a true crime story like Ann Rule. This book manages to tell us of a horrible crime without unnecessary sensationalism. Ann Rule brings us so close to Cristy and Danny that we are left wondering what became of them and hoping they have done well.
5,It still shocks,"Before Susan Smith and Andrea Yates there was Diane Downs. One day a seemingly normal woman killed one daughter, cripled another and seriously wounded her oldest child. Anne Rule was at her best with this book and has never written so well again. She get's into this monster's head and it's a terrifying ride. If you 've been unhappy with Anne's later works get this one and see what True Crime can really be."
5,Chilling!,This is the best true crime novel that I have ever read. I love anything by Anne Rule but this story in particular grabbed my attention and just drew me in. The fact that a mother or parent could do to her own children what Diane Downs did is unbelievable and heartbreaking in itself. Anne Rule does a great job profiling Diane Downs. This is definitely a real page-turner!
3,True Justice,"The reason that I chose to read this is because I saw the movie, and wanted to get a better idea of how the law works. Reading the reviews on the cover made my stomach turn. It's a true crime story, not a who-dun-it! It's my position that Anne Rule's writings are well written. If someone reads this carefully, they may have a better understanding of how the judicial system works, and also how much help we need, as a society to understand that in this story, and so many others similar to it, there truly are no winners. Remind yourself that it isn't fiction, and then make your decision on how riveting it is. The question is, should we continue to allow horrible crime to be glorified? To do this would be, in my opinion a true miscarriage of justice!"
5,truly unforgettable,One of the most disturbing books you will ever read. This is a masterful portrait of evil personnified. I read the book years ago and I have never been able to forget the children who were victims in this tragic story. Read this book
4,Classic Ann Rule,"Considering the topic this was a pretty easy read, would recommend to someone who wants a light book before bed"
1,Worthless...,"A real waste of time, filled with warmed over platitudes and drivel that you've heard a thousand times before..."
1,Not satisfied,"When I opened the package and felt the material. It was very thin, I was suprised it wa s 300 count. But what was worse was the fitted sheet barely even went over the sides of the bed. I ordered a queen set and was putting on a queen mattress. I sent these sheets back to Amazon and am waiting for a credit."
5,Very nice color bulb for cichlids!!,Looks great for cichlids!! Really brings out the blues in fish. I'm happy with this product. Much better than the standard perfecto bulb.
4,As Anticipated Arturo A+,"Arturo Sandoval has continued to entertain and amaze me with his dynamic range, depth, and choice of work. I don't care much for New Orleans style jazz unless it's live, which is how Trumpet Evolution begins. But the suceeding selections, especially, The Man With A Horn and those following made me want to listen non stop. I cannot wait to see A.S. in concert again. Until then, there's much in these 19 pieces to keep me sated. I am definitely a FANantic!"
5,HP Vinyl,The product is very good quality.I use it in my hp photosmart D7360 and my Canon Pixma PRO9500Mk11 printer.They both print great pictures.
3,good but doesn't give enough bright light,"it's a nice enough light. the nature sounds feature is a nice way to wake up to in combination with the light. in theory, the light turns on slowly and gradually til it's at it's max. but the turning on isn't as gradual as i would hope - i think i still wake up as soon as the light turns on. and when it is at the max light, i had hoped the light would be sort of be like sun light, filling up the room but it's rather dim. i changed the shade to get more light in the room. that all being said, it's still a very pleasant way to wake up. just not sure if it's worth all the money."
2,"Love the idea, poor execution","I had this clock a couple of years, but it was always difficult to use. Then after 1 year, the light stopped working - which I've read on several other reviews. It's the best looking of the lighted alarm clocks on the market. I'm going to wait a couple of months and see if any other models are updated."
2,Blue light didn't work for me,"This product was well-made and the company seems respectable, so I don't like having to give it a bad review. However, the blue lights just didn't work for me: no difference in mood, energy, or sleep patterns, and they actually gave me a bit of a headache.I went back to use my 'Day Light' light, despite the fact that it is like a giant soccer stadium light and must emit some UV (since it puts blond streaks in my hair if I overuse it).Sorry, Philips, its an otherwise good product, but the blue light doesn't seem to be my frequency."
4,It's all in the dose,"Scared of UV exposure, it's all in the dose.From the goLITE FAQ:The goLITE produces no UV or near UV, and 1/20th of the blue light found in sunlight. In other words, the goLITE would have to be 20times brighter in order to be a risk for macular degeneration or other eye disease."
4,"Small, lightweight, fairly effective","I purchased this Apollo Light Therapy box just before spring actually came. I used it for a couple weeks before the weather started to change and, overall, I like it a lot. I will look forward to seeing any/all positive effects next fall and winter, but it's VERY lightweight and has a nice travel bag that came with it, too. I found it to be incredibly helpful to have the versatility of using it with just the battery. I easily moved around the house to different rooms and brought it with me as I was doing work. I would and have recommended it to friends.The only reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is simply because I'm curious to see how I will react to light therapy next year when there is markedly less natural sunlight to supplement this light box in late fall."
1,Watch out for beauty -- its' only skin deep.,"I have owned one of these pencils and although they are pretty on the outside, it will break. When it breaks, you are on your own. They are not like Cross Pens -- the manufacturer WILL BILL YOU for repairs, and it will not be inexpensive. I carried Cross pens for years, they fixed them for free and completely stood behind their product. After fixing this pencil twice, and paying for it each time, I have decided to go back to a Cross product. These may be attractive looking -- but it is only skin deep."
5,A Wonderful Book,"This is a wonderful book! Like having a good friend walk you through having a child with special needs. It is a very positive book and makes you feel better about your life, your child, and your future."
5,inspiring music,"Recently got this album from my brother. I love the words and music. I am a singer songwriter and the songs have deeply inspired me. Melodies are simple, words are direct... Innocence, beauty, and love shine thru this album. I wish the artist all the luck in the world and I hope the world is lucky enough to hear this CD. Great vocals as well."
1,What a waste,"My 8-year old son was very, very excited to receive this item for Valentine's day from a relative to play on the **brand new** Dell computer that he got for Christmas. He ripped the packaging to shreds in his glee to open it and begin play.It won't work.We've tried it on his computer (NEW!) and my 3-year old (but then top-of-the-line) Dell and neither will run the game claiming one ""hardware failure"" after another. E-mail to THQ yielded no assistance whatsoever.Before you buy this, consider very, very carefully what the minimum system requirements are."
4,Good Stuff,"Anything Nazareth puts out will never fall below 4 stars in my book. Cool album cover but not my first choice on my Nazareth buy list. I do own it but that's before I got ""Hair/Dog"", ""2SX"" & ""No Mean City"". All in all, great rock-n-roll!"
3,I bought Fool's Circle/Nazareth from Amazon,"I like Nazareth a lot. After the Malice In Wonderland release, I found their new sound ""interesting"".Dan McCafferty was never a great vocalist, but the way he delivers the lyrics on Malice and Fool Circle made him more listenable. Songs ""Let me be your leader"", ""We are the people"" and "" Every young man's dream"" were the high points for me and the rest of the album is good filler."
2,Way too diverse a set for my tastes,"I love soulful house music of the type usually played and created by Andy Caldwell & Om Records.This set however is too rock orientated on several tracks for my taste. Track 1 in particluar i just have to skip, Tracks 2,9 & 10 i also cannot stand.The other tracks are really good, but for me the album is ruined by the 4 ""rocky"" (IMO) tracks listed above.Maybe my tastes are narrow, but i just like soulful vocal house music through to RnB."
2,not worth the money,"bought this for my great dane puppy, only 8 months old, and after only 2 weeks of using it it ripped in half. she isn't full size yet so her weight shouldn't have torn the whole hammock. very inconveinent that there is holes in the middle of the hammock for seatbelts. not only do the holes let all the hair fall on the seat anyway, she got her foot stuck on it once and ruined the whole thing :/i think it would've been perfect without the holes, easy to set up and take down if anyone is riding in the backseat and would've actually kept her hair off the seats! save your money for a better hammock!!"
5,Dogs and Hair in it's place,This product keeps the dogs from poushing through into the front seat and it give them stability in the rear as well as the dog hair stays on it.
1,dog hammock,Do not like.......... it does not stay in place. Our dogs are little and the dog hair still gets all over the (new) car....... We bought a outback and had to put the hammock all the way in the back and just lay it flat...... and it still goes not work all thay well.
4,great solution,I have a mastiff and part irish wolfhound. They both fit in the back seat when I use the hammock. Keeps dog hair to a minimum in the car.
2,OK but very smelly,"this product seems fairly well made but it smells terrible, like toxic. I have washed it twice and it still stinks. I am trying to air it out. I probably should have returned it right away but decided to try to desmell it. After 3 washings it still stunk and my husband complained of headaches...so we threw it away."
1,Needs improvement,"Well, it won't stay in place, the straps are flimsy, be big holes for seat belts let the dirt/hair from the dog fall through to the seat, doesn't cover the top of the back of the seat (my dogs have beards and rest their head on the back.....) Overall it's not practical. The seatbelt feature is useless, nobody would want to sit on that and buckle up. Besides, the reason it has the straps is so it can be removed quickly in case of human passengers. It's useless, looks ugly in the car and won't stay put."
4,Good quality,"Quality is good, thick material, definately better than I expected. We don't have true headrests on our back seats, but the straps are adjustable so you can adjust as needed. My only negative is I would like a little more fabric between the seat and the back of the front seats. But overall am happy with the product."
3,"Hammock seat cover, just OK","Does the job OK, so far. Wish the hooks were of higher quality. There appear as if they will break at any minute."
4,clean seat and floor!,"I purchased this seat cover as I was looking for a more secure solution to covering the backseat of my Camry than the bed sheet I had been using. This cover is working well for me. So far what I have done when I notice a collection of dog hair, I simply use a hand broom to sweep things out. I have noticed that my dog isn't able to grip the seat as readily, so she tends to slide around some when she is standing and the car is moving. Since she is usually laying down on the seat I am not overly worried about safety. I am pleased with this product."
2,Ok for the price,"The material is ok, no rips or anything but my dog slides all over the back seat. I wish this had some sort of non-slip gripping on the bottom. I have a 92 lb Great Dane/Lab mix, so it's not good when she slides. I ended up buying another one that has the non-slip bottom."
3,"Decent read, but not worth 5 stars","Ruby Silverman is thrity two and still single, running Les Sprogs an exclusive baby boutique, when her mom annouces her own pregnancy she wonders if she find love. Then she meets Sam Epstien an American doctor working in London. Then Ruby finds out about a baby brokening scandal that may invovle Sam. ""Gucci Gucci Coo"" was the first book that I have read Sue Margolis, while the backcover seem cute, but I have to say that I really didn't enjoy. There just seem to be several plots going on and to me it was to much."
5,Amazing !!... Fantastic !!,"It is beautiful! I cried with the Veni Emmanuel and the Celtic Hymn. I danced & jumped--kind of--with the Diablo suelto and the Flamenco. I was transported with the AltiPlano piece to my first trip to the cono sur. Amazing!What a gift to your audience! Congratulations, thanks and blessings once again..."
5,Excellent Translation,"This is a nice-sized, well-cut, book with bright pages and clear text. However, the font on the cover isn't as fuzzy in real life as it is on the image at the top of the Amazon ""purchase page""--not to mention the fact that the blue jacket is startlingly vivid in real life. Overall, a relatively stunning yet simple book that goes well with jeans or dress-pants."
5,The Producers,A 1st rate satire. Historicly correct humor. To enjoy this an IQ of at least 130 recommended. Not for red necks or pickup truck drivers.
1,Stephen Mitchell should stick to Rilke.,"I have long enjoyed reading Mitchell's translations of Rilke. However, I found his reading of the gospels to be a smug editorial far more comfortable in its views than those of the strictest traditional Christian commentators. Mr. Mitchell has stripped the gospels of their poetry."
1,"the ""gospel"" according to Stephen Mitchell","I'm not exactly sure which ""jesus"" this ""Gospel"" is supposed to be according to, but if you really desire to deny everything the son of God died and was raised back to life for, and ignore His own testimony as to who He is- ""I am the Way the Truth and the Life, no one comes to the father but through Me""- Than by all means buy this book! Maybe you can ask Jesus what he thinks of it when you stand before Him in Judgement for the sins you deny. Or maybe you could acknowledge your sins and be justified by faith in the real Jesus Christ- ""Be earnest therefore and repent! Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with Me""-Jesus."
4,good book,"Jesus taught that the Kingdom of God is something you can achieve while you are living on this earth, not simply a reward that you get after you die ""for being good,"" and for ""believing."" People who say this book is no good are the types of people who never think about anything for themselves and just believe what they are told because it is the safest thing to do. In fact they are jealous of those who can articulate their own opinions as well as Mitchell does. I strongly question the mind of a person who uses words like ""blasphemy"" to criticize the honest inquiry of others; I feel they need to grow up and reach a more adult stage of spiritual understanding. By the way, for the guy from Moreno, California, ""son of Mary"" is accurately translated from Aramaic as ""illegitimate son of Mary""..."
1,jeez,"whats up with people these days and trying to make it worse for a man that is already obviously suffering from the last accusation made against him. he has done nothing but create the best music there is and giving money to dying/homeless children, when your bashing him its like saying that you want children to die, you want music like britney spears to rage the top of the pops etc.. I wasnt much of a michael jackson fan before all the hysteria over him, now im a die hard fan cause people doesnt know how to respect a man that has lived a life in public just to please us!"
1,ALL OF YOU WHO BELIVE THESE BOOKS ARE PATHETIC,"IF YOU LIKE THE TRUTH, DONT BUY IT.ITS FUNNY HOW YOU JUDGE THIS MAN ON BOOKS WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO HE'S FALLEN OUT WITH OR NO LONGER TALKS TO WHO ARE TRYING TO GET REVENGE AND MAKE A QUICK BUCK. MJ IS NOT SAD AND PATHETIC - YOU ALL ARE. IM NOT A HUGE MJ FAN BUT IM NOT ABOUT TO GO AND CALL HIM SAD AND PATHIC BASED ON A BOOK THATS NOT EVEN WRITTEN BY HIM. WHO DOES THE AUTHOR THINK HE IS? MIKES PSYCHIATRIST OR SOMETHING? UNTIL MJ ONE DAY COMES OUT WITH ALL THIS AND ITS THE TRUTH I WILL NOT BLIVE IT. ITS SAD HOW THE PUBLIC TURNED THEIR BAK ON HIM. OH AND HIS TALENT ISNT DOWN THE DRAIN...I BELIEVE IT CANT BE LOST.. I JUST THINK ITS MASKED BEHIND THE CONTROVERSY..."
1,Something to think about...,"I don't believe one single word for the simple reason that after 20 years of employment and all the privilages that came with his job with Michael Jackson including Michaels trust and friendship, Jones has No Integrity whatsoever. Jones barely had one foot out of the door and he did something so unethical & immoral. There is no reason to believe that he'd be honest in what he presents to the public."
1,"NOT interesting, NOT one of the better books on Jackson","This was NOT interesting, NOT one of the better books on Jackson. Most of it is NOT believable either..."
1,Shame of America... Lies Sell,"Sometimes, it is truly a shame that America holds it's freedom of speech act so highly... it allows this kind of crap to actually get piblished. :(This disgruntled ex-employee, fired by Michael, has an obvious axe to grind, and sadly for Michael, the freedom of speech act does not include a clause that says this ""speech"" must be based in FACTS and not serve to unduly defame another through use of LIES!This book is only fuel for MJ haters, who will believe any garbage thrown at them, without the intellect to question the words they read nor the willingness to consider the motives pushing the author to write them.A better use of this book would be fuel for a bonfire... So sad that trees had to die for this garbage to be printed on."
1,What a joke!,"LOL! I read the first few pages and could not stop laughing at the way these two tell obvious outrages lies. The author qoutes unfactual information from other sources, like Diane Dimond, who has never had anything good to say about MJ. In the few pages that I read, I was able to find a huge contradiction to something that the author wrote concerning the song Word to the Badd by Jermaine Jackson. Some of the lyrics were misqouted and twisted to feed into the lies that this book offers. Too funny. Not worth purchasing, unless you are a fan of sensationalized fiction."
1,Bob and Stacy are Sad individuals,"Bob jones was fired. He is nothing more than a disgruntle employee who is now trying to cash in since he now has no job. You have to realise that there had to be a reason for his dismissal. people this book will be in the .99 cents bin at your local bookstore by the end of July , so save your money. There is nothing is this piece of trash that you have not heaRD ALL READY DURING THE TRIAL. Most of that has been proven to be lies. Bob jones doesnt get a pay check from Michael Jackson anymore now he wants you to pay his salary. his co-author Stacy brown , who passed him self off as a Jackson Family friend during the trial is nothing more than a over weight black man with a sissy complex. If you are in to bashing jackson dont waste your money on this book, just tune in to one of the many cable news program. You will find the same info thats in this book for free."
1,absolutely ridiculous,This book is nothing but a pack of lies written by a money hungry ex-employee with an axe to grind. Don't waste your money.
1,What a waste of paper,"This is simply pitiful. Bob Jones is a nasty individual who turned on Michael Jackson cause he got fired..and decided to make money off of MJ by writing this dirty book. Don`t buy it, there`s isn`t one bit of truth in it, if you do read it, then be aware that you`re reading science fiction."
4,Protection,"I work around loud die cutting equipment all day. I have used other hearing protection in the past. Helmuth for one. I do have some hearing loss and was looking to preserve what's left ' I found that the peltors are very responsive to loud noises with a little decay factor. If the noise is repetitive fast enough the sound is decreased constantly but if the noise repeats slower then you get a pulsating sound which I prefer a little decay. The muffs are comfortable and I only remove them when not needed or sweating. What I did find a little disappointing was since my hearing is a little diminished, the muffs actually hinder my conversing with anyone. My old helmuths muff worked much better at allowing me to hear normal conversation. Turning these up increases white (backround) noise too much. I still rated these high because they work well, just it didn't improve normal conversations."
5,Top class protection,I purchased these ear defenders for use in an indoor pistol range. A friend bought the Tactical Sport version. The additional protection offered by this model is easily noticed in a side by side comparison.My main concern was the fact that shooting indoors is generally louder than outside because the sound of the shots gets trapped and reflects back at you.I only have one pair of ears and I believe in doing all I can to keep them working.
2,Save Your Money,"Don't believe for a minute the rave reviews preceding this one!You may be a seasoned embedded system programmer, and you want to get up to speed quickly rather than relying on pouring through Microchip's reference manuals, this book is not it.It's too bad that the author is not as good at writing as he is at marketing the book. A good writer will make even a difficult subject easy to understand. It is not so in this case. Sadly, the converse is true. (Randal Schwartz of Learning Perl fame, are you listening?!)I am going to learn to design and program the PIC, but not with this book.Bottom line: save the money and stay with the Microchip references available online."
1,not for beginners,"This might be a suitable reference for someone who is already intimately familiar with PIC microcontrollers but it way too advanced for beginners. From the first page the author assumes you already know alot about microprocessors including the lingo.The writing style is just dreadful, with sentences that run on and on in a prose that would leave Yoda confused. This is not a fun read about what should be a fun subject.Beginners will find the book too obtuse and advanced users need nothing more than the device datasheets so the book is pointless."
2,I agree with yogagirl 100%,I also lift weights and am in shape and it tells me my body fat is about 35%. It's more like 18%.
1,disappointed,"Book wasn't what I am looking for, expected more raised dots so i could actually feel the Braille. Pictures advertising it were deceiving."
3,Its an okay book but I'm sure there are better out there.,"It is possible that I will be blind in a few years so I wanted to learn to read Braille. This book has great beginings however the ""dots"" are not raised and I don't want to learn to read braille by sight. Its an okay but it would be better if the whole book were in actual braille though."
3,Good Place To Start,"I think that this book gives one a good place to start learning braille.However, like other reviewers have mentioned, this is *extremely* basic. The only raised dots on my copy were the alphabet on the back cover.I think that an improvement to this book would be if there were some pages devoted to raised dots. That way, this book would be an even better and effective way to learn braille."
3,good first book,"This book is good for people who know nothing about braile. It only talks about braile grade 1. it sais nothing about braile grade two. Also none of the book is ""raised"" it is flat so you can't try to learn with your eyes closed. You have to look at it. Only get this book if you know nothing about braile."
2,"Where is ""Too Drunk...""!?","The only reason reason I bought this album is because I thought it had the song Too drunk on it but it doesn't! I am so upset, if Shazam hadn't told me that it was on the album I would have look into it more. I am very disappointed... Does anyone know where Too Drunk is, how can I buy this?"
4,Quality Junior Set,"Hello, this will be quick and to the point. Definitely missed hearing these guys. This album has a mix of slow songs and hard songs with Brooklyn being a different sound for them. Good tunes though, great album. definitely a summer time, roll the windows down and JAM. Crazy B#tch is a quality tune. Look for this one to get some serious radio time. Good job Josh and the boys.ROCK ON! COME TO CINCY!"
4,Back to Rockin'!,"Some saw this as a bit of a bounce back album for Buckcherry, though in truth I thought their widely disregarded Time Bomb wasn't as bad as some wanted to believe. Rather Buckcherry faced a dilemma that few do...playing good music at a time when talent means far less than image and, not being a corporate boy band or the flavor of the month, they briefly faded into obscurity.Who cares?They're back, and as good as ever on this album. Catchy, punk infused sleaze rock, driven by some strong drumming and a guitar player who sounds like he's just having a damned good time, but the real focus is the charisma of vocalist Josh Todd, and the attitude he manages to bleed into the music.This is a good album, full of kick a$$ rock n' roll, whether you want guitar driven hard rock (""Next 2 You,"" ""Out of Line"" and many others), the uber-catchy and obvious single (""Crazy Bitch""), slower numbers (""Sorry""), or a new take on a Stonesy style (""Brooklyn"").Good stuff!"
5,Buckcherry kicks a$$,"Would love to see this band live, I am sure they put on a great show. Some good songs on this album."
3,reviews,"People who write reviews in here should be considerate and open minded to others beliefs. I feel that Yoga benefits people of all beliefs and one does not have to believe in the Eastern belief system to benefit. I also believe there should not be anything said about Yoga as being ""dark"", ""hethen"", etc. until one really knows what they are talking about. The worship of ""Idols"" is not correct...these are symbols for aspects of God such as Peace, Love, etc. Before one writes with ignorance they should check their facts and have some knowledge of that which they are stating."
3,could be better,"the matches are good, but a lot are on other dvds that many fans own. It really shocks me that the survivor series match were The Rock made his return isn't on this dvd or the blu-ray"
1,Utterly ridiculous,"This book is so incredibly contrived, I'm not sure where to begin. How about the part about recommending that a consultant learn to type fast, as it allows one to get more work done per minute and gives the impression that you are busy? In the end, it's just another thinly-veiled attempt by some self-appointed ""experts"" to cash in on the R/3 phenomenon. There are better books out there that provide a lot more knowledgeable insight on being an independent consultant; they might not be SAP-specific, but neither is a lot of this book's content--in spite of its title."
5,"Outstanding job, it's imperative to recognize the efforts.","After all, Bruyn & Ken's influx of new talent allows our entire IT community to prosper. ""Becoming a SAP Consultant"" has been a leading source for SAP in the metropolitan area for years. (Javaid Ansari Developer on Developer/2000)"
2,NOT ANOTHER...........,listen....the songs are great but why are their so many kiss best of's. this is a good one no doubt but it shouldn't have even be made. i have a lot of kiss records and i could easily make a best of for free and trust me having their full cds are a lot better than having a best of. the good thing about this CD is that even has tracks from the solo albums that no one liked much so you kind of get a taste of everything2 best songs-detroit rock city & tonight you belong to me2 worst songs-hotter than hell & makin love
4,Well Roundec KISS,"This two disc set sees KISS as legitimate musicians, which they were trying to do since 1979 with the Dyanasty album. Shandi is a big one here, showing the band's ability to write pop oriented music, and I Was Made for Loving You just as good as any other disco hit of that era. Also showcased here is their early stuff which can be criticized as too soft for their over the top look and image. This is a good disc to quit obsessed tendancies with this band KISS, as it offers a good sample of their musical sound to the early 80s. I like it."
4,a comment on your service,"Hi: Thanks for your invitation for a review of my recent purchases.As you know, I bought this great Gold album by Kiss. Unfortunately, I received it damaged, the case was broken and one of the two Cd's was damaged (some songs are unaudible).Well, I have not send this item back because I live in Mexico City and it may cost much more to send it than buying it again.However, I'd rather let you know that this happened and it would be good if you try to avoid this kind of inconveniences to your customers.In the past, I've received some other cases damaged or broken, but this was the first time ever that the CD was damaged too.Well, thanks for your attention.Sincerely,Alberto Huidobro"
3,This Teeny Tiny Pumpkin,"is made in Thailand, not France as you would expect from a Le Creuset item. In the product description, it says, ""Festive and fun. Welcome fall with the addition of these petite pumpkin casseroles to your set. Serve up individual servings of pumpkin soup or fill it with cinnamon for an added spice of life. Superior CAST IRON construction retains and distributes heat quickly and evenly. Limited lifetime warranty."" This product is part of the Le Creuset stoneware line and IS NOT cast iron. The lid is not at all tight fitting, either. This casserole is very small. I know 12 oz isn't much, but I did think it would be big enough to hold at least enough food for an individual casserole serving. As a (very) proud owner of 16 pieces of Le Creuset, it saddens me to have to give this only 3 stars, but I had to deduct because of the poor fitting lid, it being made in Thailand, the incorrect product discription and the size. On the plus side, it is very cute!"
4,Functional Cute,"This line of cookware is functionally cute. Have no idea how this is going to stand the test of time, but for right now it gets the job done and makes you laugh on the inside."
5,Boatbuilding for the common man,"How to build a boat. when you don't have a whole factory floor. Megabucks for rigging and outfitting. Fancy tools. George talks about how boats can (and are) built by people who need them for a living, where function is the key, not fashion. If you prefer something that works instead of the latest trends and manufacturer's selling points, this book is for you. He tells you what works, what you really need, and what the slick magazines will try and tell you to get. Using George's information, and the plans included in this book, you could build somethign to cross oceans. Or you could start dreaming dreams, and get off your rump and make them come true for yourself."

1,Bad Batch,"Unbelievably bad. I received version 4.0 (thanks a heap) and the install program would not launch (using XP). Just for added insult, the cable was inert, too."
1,Addie,"I ordered the Motorola Phone Tools 3 & mini USB. I received it in a plan envelope. There was no box or instruction sheet. I bought it new, but it must have been used. The CD was not sealed. The USB cord did not have the Motorola logo on it. I tried to install the CD into three different computers and none of them would allow me to transfer the pictures. I was trying to get my pictures off my razr phone and onto my computer. I tried and tried. I usedMotorola Mobile Phone Tools US 3.0 - Mini USB, Compatible with RAZR V3, Q Phone, PEBL, V180, V220on different computers. I tried installing and reinstalling, but I was unsuccessful. I wasted my time and money on this product. I then had to buy another product, Phone Tools 5 from another company. The new one worked and I got my pictures on my computer. It also came in a box with written instructions and the Motorola logo on the USB cord."
5,Back up your phone numbers and much more!,"If you have a razr phone or a simple(relative to what's available now)phone that's compatible with this phone tool, then don't hesitate. I think they're giving these away now because of bluetooth enabled phones and computers. All I really wanted this for was backing up all my numbers. I've had previous phones die before i could do this. Now all my numbers are backed up and I can send texts through my phone by typing on my computer. I have ""dial up"" access to the internet with my computer, anywhere that I have a cell signal, internet access just uses the minutes on my phone plan. I can syncronize my calender on my razr phone with outlook. there's even more that I can't remember. I think I bought it for $1.65 plus $4.00 shipping. It installed on my xp computer like any other software."
1,Chinese disc and doesn't work with razr V3xx,Waste of money. If they rip off several thousand people they will make several thousand dollars. Don't buy it!
3,Still wondering if I lost my hearing,"Its fast, loud and raw...its St. Anger. The piercing sound of Lars new snare ring. The new sound of James vocals. Kirk without a guitar solo to be found? Ive personally have been a fan of Metallica since the Justice Album. Anyway..now its a decade later and their still pounding and rocking, just differently.The first time I heard the new stuff was on MTV ICON. At the very end of the show, im hearing this fast beat, stop and go like guitar riffs. Wow...what the heck is this? I loved it so much and to find out it was ""Frantic."" Blah Blah Blah, I know. The lyrics and singing was a total shock. The writing style is not really what I expected based on their past material. Some of the lyrics are [kicking] others are ummm...confusing. The music was determined to sound like ""I Disappear."" It is, and more.All in all...I agree with 8 out of 11 songs. The meaning of 3 stars given to St. Anger."
5,Good information!,As always Cesar's videos are loaded with helpful information about training your pets. I always enjoy all of his teaching material!
5,Cesar Millan Season 4 Volume 1,"Excellent value. I watch all of Cesar's DVD's many times and pick up something new every time. It's great to be able to watch the episodes right through without any interruptions for adverts. I would recommend getting as many of Cesar's DVD's as possible for anyone with dogs. If you are looking for a 'how to' DVD on training, this isn't it. Cesar is not a trainer, as he has told people many times. He is a dog psychologist; he evaluates the dog then trains the people to be the dog's leader. Each dog is different and he points this out often. What works like a dream with one dog may not be effective with another, but he is able to pinpoint with incredible accuracy, exactly how to approach any problems with any dog."
4,Good but not great,"The material is great, but the first edition (at least) suffers from enough typesetting flaws to make some content difficult to follow. There are several instances where the prose indicates some text is supposed to be highlighted in some way but it is not e.g; bold to indicate differences from an earlier code listing, or variables missing the distinguishing overlines resulting in incomprehensible formulae."
2,Interesting concept falls flat...,"This book is told through the eyes of Sally Jackson, both in 1946(where she is to help bring Nazis to justice) and in flashbacks in 1933, where it tells of what went wrong between her(then a naive daughter of the U.S Ambassidor) and her lover Christian. We can kind of see certain plot twists coming, and there are a few scenes that made me question Sally's intelligence. The villian, Heydrich, is really creepy, and the story ends as it must."
3,"good, but incomplete","I was happy to find out Tina's vido collection 83-91 was coming to DVD. But however, I am disapointed with the selection. Both We Don't Need Another Hero and Typical Male are replaced with live performances (which there is nothing wrong with, as I do believe she is the quintessential live performer), but I haven't seen either video in years. Also Two People & One Of The Living as well as the live clips It's Only Love and Overnight Sensation (both of which were played on MTV in the 80's) are missing. However, what you get is still a very good overview of Tina's Capitol era.To those looking for the two Twenty Four Seven videos, pick up the CELEBRATE DVD. Those are included as bonuses."
3,For the specialist in you,"Heidigger's ""Being and Time"" is one of those books that students of philosophy feel they really ought to read, if only to say they've read it. But reading it and understanding it are two different things. Given that Heidigger, like his fellow Germans Kant and Hegel, was a better philosopher than he was a writer, one will find that digging into his magnum opus can be a rather strenuous and perhaps ultimately unrewarding experience. The prose is so dense as to be all but impenetrable. I had to read this with a printout on hand of Heidiggerian terms (about 30 pages worth!). Even so, I got very little out of this book and would have been better served had I grabbed an ""introduction to Heidigger"" text instead.If you're a specialist and you enjoy torturing yourself with this awkward madness, knock yourself out. If you're looking for a philosopher who knows how to make himself understood, try Nietzsche or Schopenhauer."
5,House of Strangers (Fox Flim Noir),"What is not to like? This is Film Noir at its best! Interfering/dominineering/overbearing father, 3 sons and their love interests. Father is the head of a bank and he rules his sons with fists of iron. Only 1 son has the guts to stand toe to toe with his father (respectful though). Trouble brews and the sons jump ship only the 1 son sticks by his father's side and vows revenge on his brothers! Think you know it all because I said this...you don't! You haven't a clue. You want to buy to one for your film library. This is how pictures should be made today. It is full of intrigue and interest. This picture is very well done and the acting is superb. Don't miss it!Maria C."
2,stick with originals,"THIS CD, ALTHOUGH OK, IS DISAPPOINTING - THE CUTS DON'T SOUND LIKE ORIGINALS. CLARENCE RE-RECORDED THEM PERHAPS."
2,REMAKES of classics,"NOT the Originals..Carter redoes some of his best known tunes, plus covers many well known souk and R&B; classics such as ""Backstabbers"" and ""Everybody Plays the Fool"". None of this bad, but wouldn't you rather hear Carter's songs as they were meant to be heard? Why settle for a tepid remake of ""Starting All Over Again"" or ""Lovely day"" when you can easily find superior versions by the likes of Mel & Tim or Bill Withers elsewhere. The prudent choice for a Clarence Carter compilation would be ""SNATCHING IT BACK: THE BEST OF CLARENCE CARTER (ATLANTIC RECORDS), 1992. It contains most of Carter's best early moments from the mid-to-late 1960s and into the early 1970s."
2,Nothing new.,This appears to be simply a recompilation of previously published files of the OSS. Little new. And nothing of 'on the ground'activities or agent running.
3,Book and CD,Book is great but no music CD was inclosed like on the discription. Shouldn't advertise with music and not send it.
5,Got Questions?,"Ask the Apostle of Faith! California students grill Wigglesworth with pointed, tough questions. This uneducated plumber from Yorkshire answers with grace, humilty, power and truth. From God's heart to Wigglesworth's mouth, the Holy Spirit is given full expression and delivers words of conviction, comfort, and encouragement.In the end, the complex is simplied, Jesus is glorified, and the reader is edified.Got an intellectual seeker-friend or new believer? This book will help win the mind and heart. None better."

3,Not A Classic But Standable,"Don't expect a classic when you see this, because if you expect that then you're not going to like it, the movie is okay. It's just a heartwarming story that is more for the family then anything else, good though, Robin Williams displays good acting here."
2,Somebody didn't know Jack . . .,"I was not expecting to be dissapointed by a film featuring BOTH Robin Williams and Bill Cosby. Two of the funniest men on the planet, you think they could have managed to squeak a few laughs out of me. To be perfectly honest, though, this movie, while it has that Coppela-esque ambition, never even achieves the depth of a made-for-Disney channel movie. It ends up feeling pretentious. I only wanted it to be funny. Instead it wasn't really . . . anything. Forgetable is the only word for it."
4,If your a big Hermann Hesse you will probably like it,"Good but most definitely not one of Hesse's best. If you're a big Hesse fan like I am you will probably like it just because it has that Hesse style of writing. However, if you have never read a Hesse book before I would not recommend this one to start. Try Steppen Wolf, Journey To The East, or Siddhartha first. This book has the absence of the mind bending and thought provoking aspect Hesse's other books have. Rosshalde is mainly a long drawn out story about a couple whose only reason for living in the same general area is there littlest boy and how this couple fights for the affection, and even ownership, of this little boy. There is a lot more to the story then just that but since I hate to ruin stories this is all I am going to say about this book. So as I said before, if you love Hesse you will probably like this book, but if you don't like Hesse or have never read his works, read another one of his more acclaimed books."
5,JUST WHERE YOUR MIND CAN TAKE YOU!,"I love this story. I suppose I can somewhat relate as I see so much of myself in the young boy featured in this book. A young, lonely boy, who somehow just does not fit in, decides to invent his own world and simply make it the way he wants to make it. The story is quirky enough to appeal to most kids as I do feel there is something of that loneliness in all of us. The illustrations are great. The story is touching and is good and it is a great illustrations of just where our minds can take us if we let them. It tells us that it is good to be a bit different and not something we should set around and worry about. Recommend this one highly."
4,Weslandia is an awesome book.,We like Weslandia because Paul Fleischman has put a lot of thought into Wesleys creations.It is a good story to be read aloud. Weslandia is a book for all ages.It has awesome pictures and is a great book altogether.

2,Misleading product,"You can get this exact same bowl at Walmart for $1. Also, this dish is listed as 8oz but you receive a 6oz bowl instead. Luckily I have a cat and only 1/4 c. of dry food goes into the bowl at a time so this suited my needs. However, this is falsely advertised and completely overpriced."
1,Not as Listed,"This DVD was a severe disappointment ... although it was clearly listed on Amazon as being in the NTSC format it turned to be PAL and therefore unplayable on North American DVD players. I returned it and was sent a replacement which turned out to be the same unusable format. It's too bad, because I own an earlier DVD in this series by this gentleman and it is excellent ... he is a very good teacher."
5,Don't try to deny it ... shoes are life!,"This book is so funny and well worth the out-of-print wait! Even if you insist shoes mean NOTHING to you - they're just covers for your feet - you will laugh out loud at this book, and the cartoons Mimi Pond draws are funny all by themselves! (Love the ""daggers""!) Every time I read this book (and I've read it many, many times, which is why I really need a new copy!), I laugh till I cry, then I run out and buy - shoes!! Cause I NEED them! And so do you! (But get this book first!)"
3,Wait a minute,"While I must agree that Crime Partners is not one Donald Goines greatest books, it is only book one in a series of three books. The other books in the series are Kenyatta's Escape and Kenyatta's Last Hit. The purpose of Crime Partners is to set the stage for the other two books and that it did.RIQ"
2,Dont Waste Your Time Or Money,This game is really bad. The only new thing is the gore factor which at first is different but it gets old and unexciting real fast. Plays like [edited]. After the third mission I totally lost interest. .... I was really looking forward to this game and then I became disappointed real fast. Next time this company should spend their time in developing a more realistic type of game and get away from the hitman type feel. This is a renter and even then entertaining for only a few hours. Don't waste your time or $ on this one. ...
1,VIETCON,"I have been waiting for this title to come out for a long time, but sadly I'm disgusted with how this game plays and looks. If I'm not mistaken this company is creating [edited]. If that's the case, it's not a good showing for what to expect. The graphics on ""Shell Shock"" look a few years old, the movement of the character is slow and rough. And the overall feel for the game is boring. Compare this game to [edited] There's no comparisons. This is a definite trade-in and title to forget."
2,"His first novel, but certainly not his best","His first novel, set in India, Crawford seems more interested in presenting local color scenes, as well as the politics, religion, and customs of the country, than in telling an interesting story. Katherine presents the love interest, though she dies of jungle fever at the end. In one scene, that is typically Crawford while at the same time seeming ludicrous, everyone involved in a tiger hunt automatically ""dresses"" for dinner each night, as if they were on Park Avenue. Also there is too much talk in the book, something that Crawford would become expert at, which only deadens everything. Crawford would write much better novels than this one later in his career."
2,wasted money,It was a lot smaller than what I thought and was oily on my skin. Too expensive for a product that is similar to cheaper products off the shelf.
1,yikes,"The light that came with my fixture was a zoo med Flora Sun. That bulb has way too much red and not enough blue. So, I got the Ultra Sun Super Daylight. Yikes, it looks awful. I'm not sure what it's purpose is, but it makes my tank look ugly and sterile. There is so little red it's baffling. It's supposed to have a CRI of 98 (A CRI of 100 is the way things look in real sunglight). I don't know who rated that, but they must have been bribed. After a minute my eyes were hurting. I'm going to return this tomorrow. I'm going to go with a Coralife Colormax bulb instead."
5,Great resourse for learning Hebrew,"Three things about this book make it stand out. First, you are learning un-pointed Hebrew from chapter 2. I thought un-pointed Hebrew would be difficult, but with a little repetition, I was amazed with how easy it actually is. Second, the website is great. It takes a few minutes to figure out how to navigate the site, but after that it is an amazing resource. It is particularly nice to be able to hear every word used in the text and insure that your pronunciation matches. Last, I found each of the exercises in the book to be very well written and helpful in thoroughly understanding the Hebrew vocabulary and grammar. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to learn Hebrew."
5,easy computer basics book,In my opinion this is a wonderful computer guide for the beginner and even as a brush up manual. With plenty of full color photos and easy to understand instruction language this book is very organized and thorough. It is almost like having someone next to you to ask for help when needed. Very very user friendly!!
4,Easy Computer Basics,"I purchased this book for my mom who is learning to use a computer. The pictures are helpful, and overall great product, I just wish it was a little more specific with some things i.e. background pictures, internet options to click on, etc. However, I would recommend this book as a starting point for a beginner."
1,worthless,"The metal on these was so flimsy I just threw the set in the garbage. They were cheap though, and I got cheap!"
3,it's ok,it works for the task..Not the best quality but they work for the tasks I will use them for. If you use them for more then occasional biscuit making invest in higher quality.
4,Makes NO sound -- just strobes,"I bought this for a guest room -- and specifically for a family member who is hard of hearing. Our electrical inspection was almost failed because this smoke detector makes no sound, only has strobe lights. (They ultimately decided to pass it because of our reasoning for the install). I realize the description doesn't mention any sound -- I wish I would have realized this when purchasing -- I've never seen a smoke detector that doesn't make noise when going off. So my fault for not doing more research -- just not the best dual purpose alarm, though I would hope strobe lights would wake anyone up!"
1,This book is useless,"This book is useless for anyone who actually knows programming. The examples are not optimized and useless in the real world. All they do is TELL you what to do instead of teaching you the language. This bad is like all the other visual quick guide, useless!!! It's great for those who knows nothing."
5,Excellent book with practical examples,"This book offers many examples of javascript used in web page design. The examples offer adequate comment regarding the code, and cover the majority of topics that someone unfamiliar with javascript could use in their own web pages. I found the examples of immediate practical value in enhancing my own web pages. I think this book is a must for those of us who have been stuck in the world of designing HTML-only web sites for too long!"
4,"A ""quick-find"" book for useful code","This is a great book for finding common JavaScript solutions for your websites quickly. It is packed with code snippets for some of the most common uses of JavaScript - like validating forms, manipulating windows, navigating frames, and making roll-over buttons.A handy index and liberal use of screen shots make this a ""quick-find"" book for JavaScript. Most of this stuff is available for free on web sites like DocJavaScript.com and HTMLGoodies.com. However, this book puts the most useful scripts together in one place.This isn't a stand-alone book for learning JavaScript. The lack of technical detail in this book is made up for by the number of useful scripts it provides, and by it's low price. It's a great primer, and complements more advanced books like Goodman's ""JavaScript Bible"" or Flanagan's ""JavaScript the Definitive Guide""."
3,"Fair attempt, but misses several core items.","The material is covered using examples which are often too printed to small to read. Also, the DOM (Document Object Model) which is the core for using Javascript professionally is all but ignored."
2,For cut-and-paste enthusiasts only!,"Dive right into JavaScript by copying text from a book, having no idea what it means, and running it in your browser! What a great concept! If you want to LEARN JavaScript, go elsewhere. This book is not it, simply cool little canned tricks for hobbyists only. Still looking for the ultimate JS book without the theory and fluff and not pure reference. If anyone has found it, email me! Please! (zlinst@hotmail.com)"
3,least intimidating intro but leaves one yearning for more,"Each chapter describes a certain aspect of the language to include code snippets to illustrate the main points being taught...its a great jumpstart into javascript, but once one gets proficient with the language, i find i hardly use it as it is insufficient as a reference manual and doesn't delve deeply into the strategies for constructing web applications via javascript."
2,You will quickly outgrow this book,"Don't bother with this book, but go right to the O'Reilly book unless you are just toying with JavaScript. You will probably have to buy the O'Reilly anyway..."
3,The Examples only work for Internet Explorer,"I first found this book was great with the examples, till friend told me my examples didn't work.The Javascript examples provided in the book don't work for Netscape. So be careful."
3,A bit shallow,"After reading Castro's ""HTML 4 for the World Wide Web"", I spotted this book and bought it without really examining it. Since it's from the same publisher, I expected the same high quality. I was disappointed.Or maybe it's not a quality thing, as such: I have a lot of experience with procedural languages, so there wasn't much for this book to teach me. This is an ok book, I guess, if you're a beginner. A better option for people with some experience, IMHO, is ""Professional JavaScript"" from WROX."
3,This book is OK,"Believe it or not, this book is an acutal textbook for a course I am taking in college. I was hoping for a book better than this for a college course."
3,Good Reference,I'm currently taking a course on Javascript online and I found this book to be a good reference tool when you are doing the actual typing. For what I use it for it is very helpful but it wouldn't help much if you were trying to learn from this. It explains what each part does but not what it means.
5,This is THE book to learn how to USE Java Script,"I agree with the other reviewer who described it as a phrase book. If you are wanting to learn about Java and JavaScripting, this is not the book for you. If you are building webpages and developing ""on the fly"" - this is exactly what you need. You come to this book with a specific task in mind and it will tell you how to do that task right now. Most of the features I have seen on ""cool"" sites like loading multiple frames at once, building slide shows, combining a rollover with an image map and the use of cookies are all here. Plus there are many topics more advanced than any web design I have done (like working with DHTML and forms).This book lets you produce like a true geek without necessarily being one."
2,Recipe-based book without teaching the basics,"Perhaps if you are interested in copying and slightly modifying simple javascript snippets, this book might work for you. But if you are interested in a more fundamental understanding of Javascript so that you can go beyond the examples, this book is lacking in explanation. But the most annoying part of the book is the unreadable (and thus unusable) legend in the appendix that indicates which properties, methods and handlers are supported by which browsers."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I am a novice Java Script user and was hoping to ""jump right in"" and apply some Java Script to my pages. To date I have not been able to make ONE of the codes in this book do what I want it to do. Furthermore, this book teaches nothing. It is simply copy and paste with very little theory or explanation. I have used other Quickstart Guides in the past with moderate success, but cannot recommend this one."
1,I would give a zero star - Do not buy this book,"I bought this book in 1997 and found useless. Now I have been seeing new edition, little bit thicker, in book stores. I browsed thru the pages and found that it is still useless.If you are just trying to insert some JS code on you web site as an hobby, this might be ok with this book. But for learning JS, this book will lead you to nowhere. For example, rather than explaining how JS code works, the book has wastes space by writing instructions like ""Type a period"", ""Type a semi-colon"" or ""type an angle bracker"", etc. It is totally waste of time and money.I would never by any books on this series."
2,Examples+ Learning-,"If you want to just copy code from the book and paste it on your websites, this is the book for you. In which case, you may as well download JavaScripts from some website. It does have line-by-line explanations for the scripts, but the explanations are not that great. it's not organized in the best manner, either. I never understood loops reading this book until I started learning Perl and used a book that explained it. Then I understood how to use them in JavaScript. If you want to actually learn to code, rather that just copy code, I'd suggest a different book."
1,"Silly Self-Help Book, just a bunch of anecdotes","I had hoped it would describe experiments that reveal habits that differentiate self-described ""lucky"" and ""unlucky"" people, along the lines of ""Freakonomics"" or ""Portfolios of the Poor"" which I loved.Instead it's a Self-Help book filled with a stream of anecdotes and a repeated assertion that if only you would convince yourself that you're lucky, your life will be great."
1,"THREE player minimum, NOT two","My husband and I play Bohnanza frequently and love it. We wanted to give this expansion a try. However, when we got it, we found out that it requires a minimum of 3 players, not two like the original and like they advertise it. We haven't been able to try it out yet since we mainly just play with two. So ignore what amazon says as the directions say 3+ players."
5,Great Book,Harold Robbins is a very good author that writes stories that define complex interactions between human nature and society. They are always entertaining and thought provoking. His stories are raw and depict life as it really is. I've enjoyed four of his books and would recommend him to anyone with an open mind.
2,Poor layout affects performance,My wife and I just returned from a week in Paris. There were several times when I tried to locate a phrase in the book but could not because of the sectional layout and the very limited index. I have used other phrase books which were much better than this one. I purchased the French/Spanish/Italian combo and now regret the purchase. We are travelling to Italy in the fall and the Italian book will probably be just as useless.
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed that this product didn't perform as expected. I still had to clean the toilet in the usual time frame.
3,Not sure.,I really can't tell if this is doing anything. It seems like I'm still cleaning the toilet at the same frequency. Hmm.... Probably will not buy again.
5,Worth Getting to Know,"This 4-disc set is an RCA Victor reissue of recordings of Vivaldi's cello concertos that Canadian cellist Ofra Harnoy made from 1989-1997. At a bargain price of $23.98, it's an absolute must-have for baroque music lovers, fans of Vivaldi, or just anyone who loves good classical music. Most people are probably familiar with Vivaldi's many violin concertos, including, of course, Le Quattro Stagioni, the famous ""Four Seasons."" This lesser known music by ""the red priest"" is just as rewarding. Harnoy's cello has a warm and rich tone, and the Toronto Chamber Orchestra provides excellent accompaniment. Superb in every respect."
3,"Not Mac Dre's Best Work, But It's A Fair Production.","I feel that this production of Mac Dre's was a decent one. However I also feel he has released some better work. A favorite of mine has always been Stupid Doo Doo Dumb. I would also like to state that the track ""Nothing Correctable"" was a masterpiece. I would like to hear a little more heartfelt work like that from Mac Dre in the future."
2,one of the worst - from one of the best.,"First of all, don't make the mistake of confusing good taste with ""hatin""........or in your case ""haten"". There are some cuts on that cd where he doesn't even rap on beat! + the producing just isn't pimped enough for mac drizzle.(can't you tell?)I bet if mac dre started doing country you'd think that was tight too. PLease don't get the wrong idea, I've always been a mac dre-niac. All i'm saying is that Mac Dre knows he can make a weak album & it will still sell no matter what, because most people are too blinded, by a name, to see true tightness (an unfortunate problem affecting the bay area these days).I don't know about you but I need a little more flavor & game for my 17 bucks. I don't care who it is, I know a weak cd when i hear one, do you?"
3,not as good as I hoped,love the book the singing on the cd is annoying though far from engaging i do however like the music without the singing to accompany the book
3,L Kurtz,"I am giving this book only three stars because it's low on my daughter's list of books she goes to on regular basis. I think firstly, the images are a bit on the gross side (and I have an art degree & can appreciate the style). Some are just not pleasant to look at even though they probably describe the poem well (poems about a stinky diaper; having a food fight; cleaning your room; falling on your untied shoelaces). And secondly, the only poem that's fun to read is the first one about being in the tub too long. That one is fun to read, but the rest are a B-. Some may really enjoy these poems, but I was disapointed with the purchase of this one."
1,disappointing,"I was hoping this book had sort of generic songs that could be sung to any baby, but found it to be more one family's special songs made up for their children. For example, ""stinky, stinky diaper"" related to someone's brother, not to just any baby. Also, and I realize this is a strange complaint, the book is too well-bound/ fancy to have near a bath tub. In addition, there were spelling errors--boy, does THAT irritate me, in this day of spell-check! and also rhythmic errors. (The odd extra syllable can mess up the assigned rhythm rather badly.) I am sending mine back...we can make up our own songs as good as the author's."
2,kids just didn't get into it...mediocre...,"This is mediocre entertainment and just not all that fun...the novelty and creativity weren't there for us.Some of it might be compared to the music at a little local Summer day camp...but without the fun of the group all clapping or stomping to the music and interacting with one another. In this video dominated age, it takes some engaging beats and performances to grab the little ones with just audio."
4,Reissue of a Holiday Classic,"A major component of my music library (6,000 titles and growing), is my ever expanding holiday music collection. It includes everything from John Fahey to the Chieftains to NRBQ to Vince Guaraldi and, of course, the holiday stylings of everyone's favorite mariachi band--Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass.While at times the Ray Connif-esque voices overpower the music, this is a welcome reissue of a classic Christmas album. Especially enjoyable are such songs as the Rodgers and Hammerstein gem ""My Favorite Things,"" along with ""Las Mananitas"" and ""Jingle Bell Rock."" And while it won't make you forget Nat King Cole's version, there is a certain charm to Alpert's vocal on ""The Christmas Song.""This is a straight reissue of the 1968 album with no bonus tracks (so it clocks in at just under 32 minutes). But if you grew up in the Sixties listening to Herb Alpert, this is an album guaranteed to put you in the holiday spirit. RECOMMENDED"
1,fake items beware...!,i buy one montblanc pen meisterstuck classic and the store sent me a fake item..! with the help of Amazon garantie the amount paid me back.
1,"Does not last, no lifetime guarantee","While the pen write well and looks good, it is essentially an overpriced status symbol. The bottom line is they do not last, and there is no lifetime guarantee. I have owned 2 (received as gifts), and both of them fell apart after a few years of limited, light use. To get them repaired you have to mail them in and pay for the repair. I would not recommend these pens."
1,horrendous customer service,"I dropped pen and it broke. Was told to bring to local dealer. Dropped off, was told delivered in week to home. Week passed called local office, was told would call back with info of status. Never called. Called 800-995-4810 customer service have not heard back after 24hrs. $385.00 for plastic pen with $12.00 refill?"
3,Eh... Dogs didn't use it.,Maybe this will work for you.... My poodle didn't catch on. I didn't leak and it seemed like a good product. Maybe he's just too dumb to know how to lick the stainless steel ball to get the water out....
5,More history than lessons in business,"Being a lifelong fan of Informix (past and future), it was a pleasure for me to read this book. By volume, I viewed the book as 80% or more the story of Informix, versus a treatment on business strategy: there are bulleted lists of business lessons to be observed that could have been attached to the history of nearly any software company that lived through the 1980s and 1990s. To apply these lessons to any current situation or company you may be leading, takes extra effort on behalf of the reader.As far as Informix and its failure, this book does make the case that it was not so much the famed accounting issues, as it was a failed business and sales strategy. Few if any are aware of the true reasons why Informix slipped. The author does an accurate and important deed in setting the record straight."
3,Not their first EP.,"First off, this is NOT Coldplay's first EP, as previously claimed. The extremely rare, and highly sought after, self-released ""Safety"" EP is their first. ""Brother's and Sisters"" is their second release and their first from a relatively, well-known label. The production quality is good but, the songs are not as strong as their 3rd release ""The Blue Room"". It wasn't until their 3rd EP that the Coldplay ""sound"" really started to emerge. Nevertheless, ""Brothers and Sisters"" is still an important part of Coldplay's history and therefore, essential for fans."
2,Low Voulme on AUX Input,"2 main reasons why I chose this over others:1. Price2. AUX Input to hook up my iPodFor the price, the product works great. CD sound quality is clear. My car has a built in pre-amp/subwoofer unit and wiring it through for the installers was easy ( at least they told me so). I was a happy camper with the sound. Volume level 18 is more than adequate for car listening ( the knob goes past 30).Now, when I connected the iPod for the first time; I thought something was wrong. No sound. Turns out, I need to turn the volume wayy up past 25 AND turn the volume dial on the iPod to almost full - to get the same volume that I get at level 18 when playing a regular CD or the radio.2 stars because with a Panasonic, you would expect the thing to work - period. The annoyance factor of remembering to turn volume down on 2 devices (or risk being hit with a blast of sound) and knowing that these things once installed - its probably not even worth it trying to yank out for return."
2,not great,"Annoying blue light and it could not read some of my music CDs, no idea why(some other MP3 players were reading them)...Plus that in the last melodies on the CDs there were some backgound noises added for every CD...The radio was fine.I would not recommend it..."
5,Not a big anime fan but this movie rocks!,All but the most mainstream anime don't interest me but I really enjoyed this movie. And I'm not big into cars or racing either.
1,This movie is retarded.,After all the great reviews I paid $20 for this movie at Best Buy. What a waste. It's just an over excited bunch of gibberish. I liked Metropolis and Akira. The story of redline is weak and simpleminded.
4,Give it 10 minutes and The reviews become clear...Excellent!,"The beginning moments of this snime and I was only impressed by the high definition source as the rest just wasnt registering or they simply hadnt showed the wow factor yet, this was because my brian or taste hadnt adjusted to the viewtiful joe style cel shading.. Once it all processed in my brain and the story and action started in full effect it clicked and I was hooked and more then happy to fniish the anime. This anime has moments that are jaw dropping and the visual style quickly works its way into your heart. But do me one favor..Please for the love of god stop making AKIRA comparisions..Very misleading in every sense of the word... Only thing that might have been AKIRA-esque would be some of the BIO weapons in a breif portion of the film.Long story short this is a must have for an anime collection, especially if you watch films on a HD Porjector..Beautiful Stuff."
3,"healthy, but not too tasty by themselves","I'm not a picky eater, and I enjoy eating healthy food. But these chips, sadly, are just not tasty at all. Extremely bland. Ya gotta dip them in a really good salsa. But then I just feel like I'm eating stale bread. Healthy bread though.... and many came broken."
5,the janet's virgin years,"from janet to damita jo OJ summurized the years ""virgin"" of janet jackson with videos hits as ""that's the way love goes"", ""again"", together again, ""i get lonely"", or got til it's gone. Two decennies of succes and worlwide hits. Videos of ""all nite"", ""i wantyou"" and ""rnb junkie"" come to supplement the long list of this collector.However i regret ""l'incompetence"" that virgin records wish not known to propose to us in this compilation ""clips"" like ""dosen't really matter or rare videos of twenty four play and others videos of janet. But it's a good compilation and i recommand this dvd. Thank you janet"
3,Pretty Good Videos: Hit&Miss Music since 93,whle Janet jackson's Videos still are cool from time to time her albums for me with each passign release from the 90's onward ain't moved me like Her Run in the Mid 80's. Video wise though She still is making Pretty Good Clips.to bad for Her it ain't translating into a Full time or even Part Time Film Gig.I wasn't feeling the New videos on a whole.
1,"Same thing as ""The Virgin Years"" (& she left stuff out) !!!!","I have 2 problems with this DVD ,1. Why isn't the music video for ""Just A Little While"" on here?2. She already released something like this!!! Try something new already (like some rare live performances , or something)!!There are some new material on here , but the videos from the ""janet."" to the ""All For You"" records are unnesscasary. She released a CD/DVD set called ""The Virgin Years"" in 2001 of those videos. On your next DVD Janet , please include the original version of the ""Just A Little While"" video clip! Please!!!"
3,Brownish Orange,"I have used this product for several years. It is easy to use and colors nicely, however, after a few weeks the shade turns to a brownish orange. No kidding!"
4,Decent Old-School Sonic Gaming,"I was very excited to find that Sonic Pocket Adventure was coming to the Neo Geo Pocket Color...it's just the type of game to reel in the customers, and move the NGPC out of the realm of niche gaming. That said, Sonic Pocket Adventure is a good game, but nothing earth-shattering.First of all, the graphics are merely decent. The NGPC has a 16-bit CPU, so I was expecting Genesis-like visuals. I was disappointed. It resembles the Game Gear version of Sonic. The sound is as expected for a handheld...tinny and repetitive. Control is fairly good, although the NGPC stick's looseness will cost you a life or two. It's also a tad bit easy to finish, as the game saves your progress through the levels.Overall? Doesn't measure up to the Genesis Sonic, but still very good nonetheless. The levels are varied, there are some innovative features, and speed like this is unprecedented for a portable system. If you are at all a fan of 2D Sonic, you should pick this game up."
2,"What Constitues a ""Debate""?","This is not a debate. Debates have 2 sides. This is a wholly Christian and one sided reasoning for the case of Christ.If you want a debate on whether or not Christ was who the Bible says he is, this is not the place to find it.The ""Host"" has studdied for the case of Christ for 35 years on the pro-Christian side.The only skeptics in this movie are shaky and almost feeble old critics that are easily dismissed and given very little time to make a point.This movie does make an interesting case for the historical backing of the events in the Bible. It shows that the events were possible if not statistically probable. But once again, it does not delve into the debate as to whether or not Christ's word is the word of God or merely fantastical stories meant to strengthen the faith of those who believe in him."
1,What Happened to Jewellllll?,"What on earth happened to Jewel? I am a kid and LOVE her old stuff, especially Pieces of You. Jewel had a deep soulful and all around incredible voice. Her lyrics were so GREAT they're undescribable and now what does she do? She makes a piece of pure crap! There's no point to lyrics like ""With all you're heeeart, you're intuition, just follow your heart heart baby! She sang about ""Who will save your soul? Well, she's got to save her own soul before she saves anyone else's doesn't she? I think so! Only thing is when I do hear Intuiton on the radio it sorta grows on me...And that's only because of the beat. Jewel, wake up and become a real musician again! Damn you Jewel!"
1,Please....,"I have no problem when artist want to change their sounds and cross generas. I admit I wasn't crazy when I heard Jewel's voice or melody, but I thought to myself ""Hey, this is my favorite singer, so I am going to give her a chance."" What a mistake that was. Unlike Jewel's previous albums, her newest one pays no tribute to her amazing voice and her ablity to create meaninful heart warming lyrics. I really hate to say this, but this album was a complete waste of talent. Jewel has deffintaly sold out in more than one way."
1,Muzik 4 Disleckzicks,"This CD is, like, way bad and 2 bad 4 me to, like, listen 2 again and stuff.Jewel, I have three words for you:- Dictionary- Sell- Out"
1,Huh?,"If you are a J.Lo fan, and you love to dance to silly music with no artistic statment, I reccomend this. After all the talent Jewel showed us with her first three albums, she decided to become a Britney wannabe. There is way too much electrafunk on this, the music is way too dighital and techno. And the lyrics suck!!!!!!!!!!! ""Run 2 me, ill run 2 u, let me crash into u?"" WTF? Has she lost her spelling skills??! Do not buy this GARBAGE, it's not worth it."
1,What the hell is she thinking?,"After recording great albums like Pieces Of You, Spirit, and This Way. Jewel (not so sparkly anymore) jumped of the deep end and into the flaming abyss with 0304. Who in the hell does she think she is? Beyonce? Aaliyah? or maybe even one of those fine ladies from Destiny's Child? Doesn't only Madonna make moves like this? I have only one bit of advice for Jewel, get back in studio and record a new album that I will enjoy listening to while sipping on a caffe latte."
2,"Going bubble gum or pop or disco or mainstream, it stinks","Hey, so I'm not a prototypical Jewel listener as I am a 35 year old married white guy with 2 kids, but hey, why is Jewel selling out? I heard that lackluster sales of her last album caused her to have riffs with management to make her a more 'packageable' star. She's undoubtedly hot, in that girl-next-door-a-little-bit-artsy-and-quirky sort of way. Gottle love that snaggle tooth. Anyway, the songs are contrite and silly and destined for the dance floor. If you want the bubble gum or pop or disco or mainstream stuff, this is your album. If you want something MORE and DIFFERENT, check out her other CD's first. The lyrics of 0304 can be catchy, but they are buried in the Christina/Britney dance mixes that lead to nausea. Jewel doesn't need to polish up and act like a teeny bopper, just do your thing without selling out!"
1,Sorry Jewel,"Others have spent words to discuss your ""experiment"" so mine are not needed much, anyway I have to say I still think you're a thoughtful, interesting personality, I love reading your interviews, they're deep and witty. You're far too clever for your new kind of music. Please, the next time you decide to be ironic, remember that it means being superior to the object of our irony, not merely emulating it..."
1,Jewel Hits Bottom,"I have listened to Jewel for years now, and I have always enjoyed her lyrical, poetic music. What happened to it? In 0304, jewel made the change from meaningful songwriter to the typical ""I am trying to rhyme everything, it doesnt matter what it really says"" pop/dance/techno. The lyrics have little depth, and there is no trace of the previous 'folksey,' political writing. I would not recommend this CD to anyone. In fact, had I known that it was as horrible as I now know it is, I would not have spent my money on it. This isn't Jewel, this is the definition of selling out on what she stood for."
4,"Less sincere, but still fun.","I bought this album mainly because I adore Robyn (remember her?), and her new CDs - only imports - are too expensive.Jewel's new release has the same basic feel as Robyn's music... not unique and original, it doesn't have extremely clever and deep lyrics (for that, see Fiona Apple)... it's just fun to listen to.Well, all except that ""Fragile Heart"" track. That's just trite, and I have to skip it. That one *is* way Britney.I appreciate the new release, and since I have a personal policy against buying CDs of artists who don't write their own songs, it gave me something to plunk down [my money] on.Just don't look for it to be life-changing... because you won't find it.BTW, I gagged at the razor commercial with ""Intuition"" playing in the background... at least you didn't hear Jewel singing... it was only the instrumental part. Still... ugh."
4,A Whole New Jewel,"I've had a neutral relationship with Jewel's records. After the build-up in popularity for ""Pieces of You"" I began to hate the record for being too precious. I therefore skipped her second album. After hearing she and her mother butchering Christmas songs on a PBS special I made special effort to avoid her Christmas album. But then along came ""This Way"", which was a progressive step away from the earnest folkiness of her earlier work toward a harder sound and more mature lyrics. That, by far, is my favorite. But ""0304"" has a very different quality that's both unique and fitting. The lyrics haven't been lost among the beats, bleats and effects of the dance environment, which is good because stripped of those production flourishes there is some great writing here. But the songs themselves are toe-tapping catchy that you find rattling in your head after the CD has finished."
4,"Not classic Jewel, but not bad","The reason I really enjoyed Jewel's music, was because it was from the heart and not overdone like much of today's pop music. When I first heard ""Intuition"", I couldn't believe it was Jewel.I'm not going to say this album is horrible, because it's not. People have accused Jewel of selling out to sell more records. When Madonna 're-invents' herself (like ever 6 months), no one accuses her of being a sell out, they call her a diva, the 'Material Girl'. Now, Jewel does it and she is just trying to sell herself and give up HER music.However, most artists return to their musical roots at some point, so even though she is re-inventing herself right now, perhaps to build a stronger fan base, I think that Jewel will eventually return to the Eva Cassidy-esk singer we've all come to expect."
1,Ugh! Tack-tack-tacky!,"Unfortunately Ms. Kilcher's third studio album release is a prime example of an artist 'selling out' to impress fickle mainstream audiences. The first single from Jewel's album '0304' is infectious, irritating bubblegum music for the masses - I'm sure it will impress and be embraced by radio audiences all over the globe."
4,"Yes, it's different...that's the point!","I think that everyone is well aware that this is a major departure from Jewel's normal style...and for those of you who don't like it, you apparently don't get it. If you listen to the lyrics, you'll see that she's the same ol' same ol'. Also, before you criticize her for ""selling out"", perhaps you should read a few interviews with her. She admits selling out, and states that she simply wanted to give it a try, and get it out of her system. Earth to critics - this is not her new ""style"". It's just something she wanted to try out, get it? Does anyone remember the Chris Gaines/Garth Brooks thing? Same game, just more class. Lighten up already and appreciate the talent!"
3,An OK CD but disappointing if you like the 'old' Jewel,"In the notes for this CD, Jewel claims that this is as close as she has ever gotten to the music she hears in her head... Then why now and not three CD's ago? This really sounds like she got Madonna stuck in her head. I loved how different her music was from the status quo but it just seems like she has lost herself and is selling out. Especially since she sold rights to use the melody from her song ""Intuition"" in a commercial for a razor by the same name. Commercials have runied so many songs, but at least they had their day without the commercial attachments.I must admit, the music isn't too bad when compared to other pop artists today, but if you really appreciated the originality of her old stuff, you are going to be disappointed."
2,Yikes,"Sorry, I couldn't even listen all the way through to most of these songs .. they are so radically different from the folk pop Jewel that we've come to know. This new breed of R&B;, hiphop, electronica just does not work - and unfortunately, this may be the bust that ends her career.Despite all of it, there are a couple of gems here. I really love the ""2 Become 1"" song and if the record label has a clue (don't count on it).. they will make a video out of it."
2,What happened to the Jewel I know?,"When I heard the first single on the radio, I wasn't too crazy about it. But I thought ""Hey, it's my favorite singer, so I'll give her a chance."" What a mistake! First of all, the songs have electrafunk, which means it is something you are likely to hear on a Jenifer Lopez or Christina Aguliera CD. Second, her voice is way too whispery. It is way too dighitalized. Last, the lyrics are GARBAGE. All of the to's are changed to 2's, and the you's are changed to u's. What is up with ""run 2 me, i'll run 2 u, let me crash in 2 u."" The only reason I gave this album more than one star is that she actually wrote the songs. Otherwise, it's trash."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,I WAS REALLY EXCITED WHEN I HEARD THIS NEW CD JEWEL WAS MAKING WAS GOING TO BE MORE DANCE. IT'S NOT EVEN THAT. I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN JEWEL. SHE IS BETTER THAN THIS. SHE COULD DO WAY BETTER THAN A DANCE CD. I LOVE DANCE MUSIC AND IT'S JUST NOT HER AT ALL. LASGO AND KYLIE MINOUGUE'S CD'S ARE MORE OF DANCE THAN THIS! I WISH JEWEL WOULD DO HER THING AND BRING US ANOTHER GENUINE ALBUM LIKE HER OTHERS.
1,What happened?,"Whe I first heard Jewel's first single Intuition from 0304, I was disgusted and confused. Where has the Jewel I once found inspirational gone to? Wheres the guitar? Whom ever made her turn into and electronic musician should be shot, he/she ruined Jewel....."
1,I should have known,Leave the lights is okay.When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better becareful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular.EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
1,To thine ownself be true...?,"Does everyone have a price? Obviously Jewel does. I guess the nasty world of commercialism finds its way into every nook and cranny these days. I suppose we shouldn't be shocked that even some talented artists succumb to the overwhelming peer pressure to conform to what is ""more marketable"" to up their sales (I mean, they have to put bread on their table too). I guess the disappointment stems from such a complete sell-out. From real, heartfelt, deep and poetic TO pre-packaged, cookie-cutter, superficial, and fake. Truly sad. Hearing ""Intuition"" by chance on the car radio, I mistook her for Brittany Spears - and nearly had to pull over when I heard it was Jewel! This is just one of many aficionados of Jewel's former music who will not be purchasing or even be caught listening to these mere fragments of what she used to be."
3,"Different, but not terrible","Let me start by saying that I think this album is fairly good. I do enjoy all of the neat beats and funky sounds. The only problem is, I think she is capable of much better music. I think most of the songs on this album have a catchy beat, but I would much prefer to hear Jewel's old sound."
1,why is jewel trying to do hip hop?,liked her better before she discovered the wonderful world of hip hop.
2,Good to see an artist change..,"It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found ""America"" somewhat enjoyable and ""Run 2 U"" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality. Also glad to here that she will be making a country CD next, it will fit her voice well."
4,HA HA HA,Ladies and Gentlemen I would Like to say WAKE UP! Did anyb0ody actually listen to te words or watch the video. She is making fun of this glossy pop world we know call TRL. People are in such an tizzy about her selling out that she is I am sure amused by the fact that people were more then likely never hearing her lyrics that they were only going for the folk sound to make themselves seem more earthy and poetic. Great Jewel shake things. Amazing Lyrics. Funn video.
4,It's meant to be ironic.,"One of the things that has really irked me about this record is not the music, it's the people who are trying to pinion Jewel into this hippie/folk artist image. It's a pop record, yes, and it does utilize pop music to make statement. It's meant to ironic and toungue in cheek.Just because Jewel inserted a couple dance beats and synths here and there doesn't make her a sell-out. I would have called her a sell out if she decided to make renditions to her past hits. Get over the folk image and get this record, it's pop music with a conscious."
4,I don't like Keynes,"I personally don't like Keynes as I fundamentally disagree with central planning.However, this book helped me to understand why modern countries do what they do economically.I bought this to help me with my economics classes, and it really opened my eyes to why the USA is in so much debt."
1,FAILED Economic Theories,"Keynes' economic theories were the same as those followed by the failed Soviet state, yet our current President and most of his economic advisers praise Keynes??For a MUCH better perspective on these areas of economic theory, read The Theory of Money and Credit by Ludwig von Mises."
3,Inferior edition of a classic,"This edition of the book contains serious typesetting problems that basically ruin the equations, and with them most of the value of having this text in the first place. I would suggest another printing, since so many publishing houses reprint this book cheaply."
2,Re-invention is not always the best path,"While this book can be said to be the one work to usher in the modern age of comics, I find it not as entertaining or stimulating as many other tales of the Batman. Miller really never displays a knack for the characterization of the Batman, and he seems to muddle through much of the convoluted story trying to figure out what Batman is and what he stands for. Most contemptible is the relationship Miller describes between Batman and Superman, which I find to be very off base. Of course, Batman could beat Superman, but never in that way. Also, Miller's art falls short from earlier and more terrific works such as in the Wolverine limited-series. All in all, not a great triumph for the Dark Knight."
5,One of the best Batman Titles,"Frank Miller's run in the Batman world is classic. He adds his own dark insight into Batman, bringing a fresh perspective to Bruce Wayne and the city of Gotham."
5,Excellent!,"Truly a masterpiece, this book explores a Batman in retirement many years following the first book by Miller, Batman: Year One.This book maintains the continuity established in the first book.The writing and quality of artwork is outstanding. It rivals Miller's other work as his best. The story is politically and socially conscious, and explores the paranoia and fear of the Cold War, the gray line between law and order, justice and vigilantism.Superman makes a cameo, and the book explores how Clark and Bruce don't exactly see eye-to-eye.I highly suggest this book."
3,I was expected better,"With all the things said concerning ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"", I was expecting something as intense and dark as ""Batman: Year one"".Concerning the drawings, Batman appears as an old, tired man, still conflicted with his parents murder and his life. Even wearing the Batman costume again doesn't change the fact he is old and try more than he can.. However, if Batman is represented perfectly, this cannot be said for the Gotham. In 1987, this futuristic vision was probably incredible. Now, the lines are not as inspired as ""Year One"". Something is missing.And concerning the story, some things are missing in order to make this chapter of the Dark Knight story a legend. Too simple? Too much reference?Maybe my own lack of experience in the DC world (I started to read some DC comics 2 years ago) is altering my judgement.But one thing is sure: ""Year One"" is a thousand times more incredible than ""Dark Knight Returns""."
2,Perhaps necessary but not truly Batman,"Frank Miller's dark, gritty portrayal of Batman may have been a necessity in getting away from the campy feel of the older comics as well as the TV show. As a whole, though, i really feel it sacrificed on the essence of the character. Batman is not meant to be a vengeful brute with an arsenal of weaponry but a force of good and a defender for Gotham City. To me, the elements on which Miller deviated may be the ones that truly define Batman...and when the core of the character changes, that really ruins it for me."
3,Meh ...,"I get it. Batman is old. His bones are aching and his body is weak. Got it. Nope, had to be reiterated a million times. Over and over and over again. It's pretty much the main topic of the story. Batman is getting old, but still fighting crime. Definitely a turn off every time it's mentioned."
4,Frank Miller Writes The End of Batman,"I hate to do it, but I had to rate this one 4 stars. Although it is such a great novel, even if it is a little dated, I feel like it really is a little overrated. Don't get me wrong, I have read the book several times, it really is good but on almost every single list you can find on 'Greatest Batman Graphic Novels' this is number one. I don't think this is the best Batman novel but you be the judge. This is not how we are used to seeing the Dark Knight, and as good as Batman: Year One is, it isn't Batman in his prime either. The reason the novel is cited as being so good is because for it's time when it was released in 1986, along with Watchmen, this book broke the mold of what the medium could do. The illustrations aren't profound but the writing on the other hand definitely is. Most anything Frank Miller writes however may be considered to be in that category. If you liked the novel watch the DC Animated movie, I think it was very well done."
4,Good,"I have to admit, I don't think I enjoyed this book as much as I should have. I have about 20 Batman graphic novels/TPB and this one was not the best, but it wasn't bad. When reading paperback books, I always worry about the covers bending, so maybe that's why I don't enjoy it as much as I should have.. I don't know. But saving money and free shipping with Amazon Prime is nice. I liked the story, but the format kind of bothered me... I would recommend this book though"
5,"Heroes, Myths, and Legends","This work is pure fantasy at its best. It is equal to the Homeric poems and the great epics Beowulf and Gilgamesh. How can I make this rather grandiose claim? Because the hero is truly larger than life: godlike, yet flawed. This man, recognizable as a man, faces inhuman foes, in both the outside world and himself.The psychoses that must compel a man to forge his life more sharply, more tempered, than the hardest blade, in pursuit of a cause that is doomed from its outset, forever threaten to overwhelm and annihilate him. How can such a one find peace? That is the beauty of this story.The pencils, inks, coloring, layout, dialogue, story- everything -describe a universe where ""giants walk this earth."""
5,"Amazing story, timeless lessons","Even though this written in the mid-1980's, the lessons about mob mentality, media influence, and extreme nationalism still hold, and seem exactly like something that can be written today. While the art is gritty and sometimes poor, that lends to the overall atmosphere of the novel. My only gripe is that the art could have been better.Nevertheless, the point of this work is the story, which is superb. I was truly amazed and engrossed from first to last. Whether or not you like comics, if you love a good story that also has social overtones, you won't do much better than this novel."
5,read this book,"I see it's been said here already, but this is the best Batman book ever, and argueably the best graphic novel of all time. A must read for any fan of this art form."
4,Used it for first grade common core,This is one of the books that has been written into the first grade common core. I read it to the class and it kept their interst. We also watched it on watchknowlearn. Students later wrote a sentence about one thing they remembered had been made from peanuts on a construction paper peanut. It made a nice hall display.
5,Thirteen Inches...With An Attitude!,"He's the toughest cop on planet Arturus. A fearless renegade. But when a high-speed space chase lands him in the middle of a gang war in the Bronx, Brick Bardo (TIM THOMERSON) is in a class of his own--he's thirteen inches tall and is armed with the deadliest weapon man has ever seen.As always, Brick has perfect timing: he lands just in time to save a streetwise woman from a scorching death at the hands of some drug thugs. She's Debi Alejandro (KAMALA LOPEZ) and she's ruffled the feathers of the wrong group of people in her fight to clean up the neighborhood.Debi takes Brick under her wing and he joins her crusade to eliminate drug lord Braxton Red (JACKIE EARLE HALEY). Now Brick is known as DOLLMAN...a criminal's deadliest nightmare."
3,"I suppose its hard to get, but it shouldn't cost double","I'm from Hawaii and this is a salt that we use often. I live in Colorado now and just brought some of this back with me while home for the holidays. I got it at Long's for $4.99 and it was not on sale. It seems a little much for this seller to ask twice that price for the same thing (same size, same brand, and not including shipping)....even if we are on the mainland and can't just go to Long's to get it. If you're desperate, get it, but try to shop around first; this price seems silly."
4,Alea Sea Salt,"Pricy but worth it. Blah, Blah Blah, Blah Blah. This is ridiculous to write when unnecessary. Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh,....."

5,This is a book I will read to my children,"Sam the Cat: Detective was the first chapter book I had ever read. I picked it up in a book fair at one of the elementary schools about 8 years ago. I am 15 now, and I decided to read it again. I like it even better now, and can see why I like books so much. I definitely will read this book to my children."
2,it could have been better,There was one good scene at the very end where she was ripping up the town. Other than that it was terribbly boring and sleezy. I thought this was a great idea. Could the woman come out victorious for once without the male domineering?
4,"50's ""B"" movie fun!","All three of these fall into the ""So bad they're Good"" catagory. ""Attack"" is my favorite of the three, the one I really bought the set for. Truly awful special effects (even by that era's standards) and a story that makes absolutely no sense (The Giant Alien apparently brings Allison Hayes home after they're encounter in the desert-- only how in the Hell did he know where she lived?) only add to the fun. ""Behemoth"" was actually quite good,though it pales in comparison to the classic ""Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", which it is often compared to. As for ""Queen""-- well,let's just say I watched it once, and then put it back in its case, never to be seen again!"
3,giant alienman and humanwoman,"the good entertainment (e.t.) facts: it has a giant alienman, giant humanwoman, the spaceship and some scattered action w/ a short ending. just ok film, seen worse."
3,a typical movie of its time,i purchased this because it fit with my collection of other early sci fi movies. the movie itself is not outstanding. it is a typical movie of the time. the acting is a little low...the effects are also a little low...yet the movie is endearing. can't really explain the 'why' part. the later version with hannah is actually a disaster. stick with the origanal.
5,"Oh bondage, up yours! Oh bondage, no more!","I love this album. I am so glad I found out about this rare and unique band. The album is a melting pot of punk, pop, and even a little bit of ska sometimes. Marion Elliot's (aka: Poly Styrene) lyrics attack the materialistic world, and have this rare sort of desperateness in them that I can relate to so well. There's also boredom and a sort of 'I don't care anymore' attitude (I am a Poseur, I Can't Do Anything). The theme of hopelessness and 'I can't do anything to stop this' attitude run throughout the entire album. And in a strange way, it's almost comforting. 'Oh Bondage, Up Yours!' is an excellent feminist anthem that eagerly steamrolls over the idea of objectifying women by being sarcastic. I highly recommend this album, it's more true today than it was in 1977."
3,could've been great...,"these shoes could have been great, but fell short in the most important department: comfort. materials and craftmanship are great. design is great and i commend the designer(s) for the thought and ingenuity they put into the shoe. the only thing they missed is to make sure there were no hot spots, which there are. if you ever bend your foot more than 90 degrees, you may feel the tendons on top of your foot (all around your ankle) rubbing against the top opening of the shoe very uncomfortably. do that for any period of time, and your wonderful day at the trail has just become torture. this situation is accentuated if you spend any amount of time off the bike hiking uphill, for that makes the ankle have a more acute angle. of course, fit is subjective, but i've never had this problem with any other type of shoe (cycling or otherwise). finally, these may not be the best shoes for very rocky terrain, as they offer minimal toe protection."
4,Good product,Have been using this product for migraine headaches for several years and am very satisfied although no product completely eliminates my headaches..
2,Didn't seem to work,Tried product and found no change in the shedding of my dogs. It worked well as a cleaning agent and smelled good.
3,"A Good, Compelling Movie","I first bought this movie in a VHS version. I then upgrated to a DVD edition.The story line takes place in the early 1960's and deals with how members of the Nazi SS slipped through the Allies hands and attempts to bring them to justice after WWII. It is the story of one man's search for answers and what that search led him to.As always, the screen writers have dievated from the novel in places, but I like the movie none the less. I view it at least once every 12 to 18 months. If you like a good drama, you'll enjoy this movie."
1,Appalling,"This film is an adaptation of Forsyth's novel. Whatever be the merits of the novel this is a terrible film. It is badly acted, with characters who sound wooden, unconvincing, and shrill. The movie goes out of its way to offer a portrayal of the Shoah that in its stridency ends up actually being graceless, the Nazis as ""plain stereotypical evil"". It does not make for interesting watching but apart from that those who are portrayed, those who died, deserve a more probing, thoughtful and serious effort. Overall an appalling film."
3,AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO ROYALLY SCREW UP A GREAT ENDING,"I have read the novel 'The Odessa File' and absolutely loved it. The ending was one of the cleverest I've ever read. I rented the movie to see what they could do to the great book. Boy did they mess it up. They re-did the whole ending, and it was horrible. I won't give it away, in case anyone chooses to watch this film. Besides the ending and another change involving Sigi at home, I liked the film. If you're a fan of the novel watch this, but be prepared to shake your head at the lousy climax."
4,A Nazi war criminal hunt thriller.,"When a journalist, John Volt, finds an account of atrocities committed by an escaped SS Nazi prison camp doctor, left by a Jew that committed suicide, he is resolved to find and punish the criminal. He follows leads to various cities in Germany, and at last finds the Jewish organization hunting for the escaped criminals. They want him to infiltrate the secret Nazi hiding organization named Odessa. They provide disguise and false papers that identify him as an escaped SS Nazi himself. He infiltrates Odessa and manages to obtain a list of the SS members that have been hidden by Odessa. He is uncovered by Odessa and he and his girlfriend are hunted by the Nazis. He manages to track down the Nazi SS doctor, played by Max Schell, and confronts him. There is a surprise reason that Volt has persisted in his hunt for this man, and I will not spoil it for you by revealing it. If these hunt, danger type of films appeal to you, you will like this movie."

1,"Wow, this soda is bad!","I was looking for something different in a diet soda, so I ordered a few of the Hansen flavors. All are overly sweet, but the Tangerine Lime is, in my opinion, undrinkable. Too sweet and an odd aftertaste. I'll stick with Fresca and Sunkist Diet Orange."
5,Perfect for your newer InSinkErator Disposal,"This is the exact replacement for the newer InSinkErator garbage disposals - this is the type that fits inside of the next - you would remove the old one by pulling it directly out from the top and inserting the new one to fit around the lip - you do not remove the garbage disposal to replace/insert this. So if you have the older style (or a non-InSinkErator disposal) that requires you to remove the disposal from the neck to get to the plastic baffle, this will not fit properly."
1,Returned Too big for sink,The description and sizing is not explicit enough to guage whether or not it will fit. One of few items I have ever gotten from Amazon that I was so disappointed in.
1,"Good features and price, but poor sound quality","The unit appears to be made well and offers good features. The price is excellent for a corded/cordless phone with an answering machine. However, the sound quality is lacking.There is noticeable background noise on the corded handset when the volume is above level two (out of four). Moving the phone to another jack where another corded phone was previously plugged in (without background noise) did not help. I bought this phone because I did not want the background noise of a cordless phone on my main phone. The noise is not awful, just annoying and surprising for a corded phone.The cordless phone sounds fuzzy both at the phone and to the person on the other end as well. Switching channels did not help. The phone was much clearer when within 5 feet of the base set, but obviously, that defeats the purpose of having a corded phone.Although there are few alternatives in this type of phone available, I would pass on this one and keep looking."
1,Stopped working the 3rd Day,"What a shame. I had such high hopes for this system as it was inexpensive compared to others (you get what you pay for). Ordered from Amazon.com and received promptly, but on the 3rd day both the base and handset unit stopped working!If trying to make calls, it would not connect from either units. When callers called me, I could hear the ring, but not the caller! Yuck. Next time I'll pay more attention to reviews here."
2,Disappointing attempt at a case book,"Professor Bernhardt's book is little more than a compilation of cases. There is very little editing and no clarifying information. The comments in between the cases are mostly statutes and some excerpts of other cases- there is very little commentary or even hypotheticals. He includes lots of clever little cartoons, but they are a poor substitute for actual content. The book is basically a cut-and-paste job, and a poor one at that- there are a plethora of typos and grammatical errors.There is a supplement to the book that is just as bad, with the added confusion of a different labeling format for the cases in it.I would strongly reccomend that this professor hire some undergrads to proofread this book, but only after he has gone back and actually added some value to the book in terms of commentary and guidance."
4,"Lucid, practical, a classic","I love this book. Pye, in concise and often beautiful language, defines the idea of workmanship as he sees it -- its history, its implications, how it might develop. He gives interesting commentary on the Arts & Crafts movement vis-a-vis Ruskin and Morris as well.Pye really is a master of the old school, and I would encourage anyone to buy this book for both its own ideas and for a look at a wonderful mind. A great companion to Krenov."
1,No good,"The recording is good, the detail of orchestra is heard well, and the tone of SKD is not bad either. But it performs only mechanically. Frankly speaking, I could not find even Opera, to say nothing of Wagner. Janowski's RING can be used as BGM."
3,postal exams,was a good book but they have changed the postal exams. so you need to know if they still use any of these exams. if they do then will be worth the cost. BUT i would not recommend the usps as a place to work unless you can handle stress.
3,"Piecemealed, Home-Sewn Shockfest 2 1/2 stars","Yep, I did it- I ruined the rating of this short story- yes, it's a short story- it's only a hundred pages.I really, really wanted to like this book- especially after paying full book price for a short story, and after all the glowing reviews.However, I felt as though there were am series of well-written and sometimes quite shocking scenes kinda home sewn together with the wrong colored string. Like the was no actual plot, just the weak idea of a young man deciding to spend his last moments with his lost love. Beyond that there's no rhyme or reason to any of the happenings in this story.I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from reading this, as obviously many other's have enjoyed it, but I felt it only fair that I share my opinion and review as well, even if it isn't as glowing at its predecesors."
2,No Ending,"The main character is around 23 year old when told the world ending is near as a meteor will hit it. Instead of dying with his young siblings and parents, he leaves them (breaking his parents' hearts) to be with an old girlfriend he broke up with because she was unfaithful. His plan is to be in bed with her when the meteor hits. Along the way to her house, he sees society falling apart. This young man stops to see all the sights instead of being with his family and barely makes it even to see this woman and her family before the world ends. The book ends with everyone still waiting to for the meteor to hit.This book is a quick read."
2,"Well, it'll look nice and goth on your shelf","Focuses mainly on bodysnatching in Scotland, with excursions to England and to the even-more-unsavory practice of Burking (killing people in order to sell their bodies as anatomical specimens, from the notorious Burke and Hare case). Interesting topic, but I can't recommend the book because of an abysmal lack of footnoting, overall disorganization, and persistent refusal to translate quotes in antiquated Scots into readable English. Has some nice pictures of mortsafes, though."
3,It was all right but on Camp Colby I didn't get it.,Well my review was that it was boring because it didn't make sense . It also wasin't scary just a little I just got scared when I was alone in my room and they just came in beacause it gave me shivers. Or I woul'd get scared when a part whene I think its scary and my sister or brother would just barge in and I would get scared.But if know one barge'd then I wouldn't get scared. I stillwould recomended to little kids beacause it would be fun and scary for little kids that belive theres monsters in there house or that mosters exist so I would recomended for little kids that do belive in monsters and that is it.
5,Great Punch-Out Inspired Game!,"This is a fun simple action game. Its similar to nintendo's punch out arcade game from 80's and various home system such as little mac the famous boxer from nes.The graphics are cool and nice! I love how each character/opponent have their own style and unique moves, such as the black pimp, asian techo chick, and other colorful fighters. The stage design is nice with cool music. Music is mostly up-beat with some techno. The story mode is nice, you get to travel to various places and there's a city map. Gameplay is simple and very fun. Characters move well with variety of expression. It might take some reflex and practice to master the game. Very artistic and zany game too.Overall a great game, must have for gba."
5,One of the Best Handheld Games Ever Made,"This is the game Punch-Out fans have been waiting for. It has all the quick-reflex fun and quirky personality of the old Nintendo classic, updated with fantastic hand-drawn animation and light RPG elements that extend the gameplay. The character design is wonderful, the writing is funny, the gameplay is perfect. Even the music is good. At 19.99, this is the bargain of the year. I can't over-emphasize how great this game looks. You've never seen anything like it on a handheld console screen.By the way, this is the first video game I've ever ordered from Amazon. I ordered it because a certain enormous Video Game store chain (same initials as Eloping Baboons) has decided not to carry it. That company's buyer is, apparently, an idiot. Thank you, Amazon, for making such a great game available!"
5,Inspiring look at laundry,The photographs are wonderfuland capture the spirit of the clothesline. Every so often I return to it's pages to be inspired. It takes ordinary laundry and makes it an art form--mainly forgotten. It includes laundry tips as well as laundry collectibles. Once you try line drying or some of the other tips you'll be hooked!
5,Great reusable filter,"This filter is just like my other 12 cup reusable filter. I have a 4-cup mr coffee coffemaker and I was not sure if it would fit based on reviews, basically it is the 4 cup version of the standard reusable filter. Just like all reusable filters i have used, a few grounds will be at the bottom but I just add extra water to brew a little more than the 2 cups I want and leave the remains in the carafe, this is true with the standard ground coffee from the supermarkets, if you grind your own, very fine will leave more grounds in your carafe."
5,Seattle Coffee Snob/Hipster Reviews the Filter,"The amount of coffee binging I am able to partake in has increased 5 fold. The filter doesn't clog up and is super easy to clean. If you are one of the many people concerned about how to be sustainable these days, a $4 coffee filter is an easy way to eliminate waste. Highly recommend!"
1,4-CUP COFFEE FILTER for 6-CUP COFFEE MAKER,"This ""4-cup"" filter is recommended for the ""6"" cup coffee maker, and I made the mistake of buying it. I can not make 6 cups. The grinds get all over the place and weakens the coffee. Any suggestions???"
3,4 cup filter review,This filter lets fine coffee grounds through. A little disappointed. I really don't want to change the coffee I am using to a larger grind. Fine grounds end up in the cup.
2,Does the job but not great,"I got this filter in the misguided attempt to avoid purchasing paper filters for my small coffee maker. Unfortunately, I didn't know anything about these kind of filters and I'm disappointed.I assumed, incorrectly, that the permanent filter would do a better job of filtering the coffee. Instead, it allows a lot of sediment through and the coffee has a large amount in the bottom of the cup. Yuk.Now I'm using this inserted in the middle of a paper filter. I'm only still using it because my paper filters have a tendency to collapse in the basket. Otherwise, I'd probably get rid of it."
1,Does Not Fit Hamilton Beach HDC700S,The filter is so small that most of the water bypasses the filter. A phone call to Medelco was a waste of time.
3,Didnt fit my coffee maker,"I bought this cause it was one of those items that shows up as people buying after purchasing ""X"" item, so i figured it would fit the coffee maker i had just purchased, but it didnt. No big deal though, for the price it wasnt a life or death issue."
2,Doesn't fit well into the Ham. Beach Brew Station,"The filter is too tall, Just a little. It doesn't fit well into the brew station. It is also too small causing you to fill it up and then have grounds in your coffee."
2,Poor fit in Hamilton Beach Brew Station,"Although recommended for the Brew Station, this basket is a very loose fit.It's up to the used to center the basket in the proper place.The filter also lets some grinds pass through it."
4,THE LOVE I LOST WAS A SWEET LOVE,"IF YOU WANNA HEAR SOME PHILLY DISCO SOUL FROM THE 70'S, MOSTLY WRITTEN BY GAMBLE AND H.UFF, THEN THIS IS THE CD F9OR YOUTHIS IS A GREAT CD OF 1970'S SOUL, FEATURING ALL; THE GREAT PHILLY SOUL ARTISTS"": THE OJAY'S, BILLY PAUL, THE SALSOUL ORCHESTRA, ETC."
3,"dated, but not bad",Its strange the things you notice in older books. Written in '88 it reads like an 80's book with Paulie's son and his girlfriend scraping by in a punk rock band. I notice work related stuff like Howard's current gf getting info from the hospital on his condition. Pre- HIPAA for any medical folk. Good for quick skimming read. The main plot is will they won't they get back togaether after his (2nd) infidelity is discovered and she leaves after nursing him back from his heart attack. B story is their son running out on his pregnant girlfriend on their wedding day.
1,Hated It!,"We thought this would be great. It is if you really want to stimulate your child. However, if you want to soothe your child into peaceful dreamland--forget this mobile. Your child will not fall asleep with this thing going. As it goes around the pieces move and hit together making a clacking sound. My daughter didn't like it very much. I think the old fashioned ones that play music are the best bet. My daughter's Grandma had one and it lulled her to sleep everytime. This thing is more for playtime."
2,Motor stopped working and BIG,"This mobile is huge, it fell down all the time, and broke on us 1 week after owning. Baby loved it of course but instead got Sassy brand seems to working great and less bulky."
4,Great mobile and excellent customer service,The mobile arrived broken. The music played but the mobile didn't move. The customer service rep (Cindy - you are awesome!) doggedly returned all my calls even though I was difficult to reach. They sent out a new mobile immediately. My son LOVES it - he'll watch it and kick with delight for 20 minutes at a stretch.I highly recommend this mobile - the excellent customer service really put it over the top.
5,My favorite baby item EVER,"My kids are older now, but I continue to buy this as a gift for friends who have babies. This mesmerized both of my kids and allowed me 10 minutes or so to shower or get dressed. My only concern was that it burned through batteries, but this is a must have for a newborn."
1,incorrect product sent,"the product is fine. I was sent the wrong product. I specifically wanted the shapes but alas, got some animals instead... great ( NOT)"
4,just what i ordered,thanks for the product! exactly how described. cheap. and pretty fast shipment (paid extra for fast shipping) would shop with them again!
2,Not the traditional oil-rubbed bronze color,If you are looking for the dark brown commonly referred to as oil-rubbed bronze to be the hinge color of this seat you will be disappointed. I converted my house over to oil rubbed bronze and I will say this is a far cry from the color most would consider oil-rubbed bronze. I would describe the color more of an antique bronze as it is very light in shade. For all other intent and purposes it functions as it should and there are no quality issues.
4,Would like to see less repeated coverage at the beginning of each section. Having it all done at the start.,Like this yoga excercises. Moves are slow and easy to follow.I have severe back problems and fibromyalgia. Most of the time I can still do all the excercises. I like being able to skip a section when I have to.
5,Great back care yoga!,"This is the perfect yoga sequence for the end of the day. Peggy Cappy gives clear direction in a slow, measured tone of voice...very relaxing! The exercises are effective for my older, sore back. I even got my 7 year old grandson doing this DVD with me one evening. It calmed him down and he quietly went through the poses with me. A very nice way to end the day or if you are a morning person a nice way to ease into the day."
4,Yoga for the rest of us Back care Basics,A doctor in my practice recomends this for her patients with chronic back pain. Several think it is really helping.
4,Yoga for the Rest of Us - Back Care Basics,This product would have been helpful but my husband did not use it! I thought if I bought it for him he might use it as he has back pain! I was wrong.
1,Not for all....,"I thought this was a yoga DVD for people with low back issues. You know, yoga where you actually move your body. It is really a stretching and relaxation DVD aimed at the very frail, old, or those in an acute phase of back pain. I would not recommend for anyone looking for 'yoga"" as the majority wants it, stimulating and active. I am a ""young"" middle age person, relatively fit, but do get low back spasms. This woman seems to be talking to the aged, infirm, perhaps hard of hearing. This is an AARP golden years special. It drove me crazy. A complete waste of my time and money. Into the rummage sale bin."
3,Yoga for the totally unfit,"This DVD was very basic, and not at all what I expected from the advertisements. It would probably be good for an elderly, totally inactive person."
3,yaoga video,"The Yoga moves are easier, but the instructor doesn't concentrate on making sure you are doing all the right things with your body as you do the move. For example, when doing the back stretches, she doesn't tell you if you have a bad back, to tilt your pelvic floor so your spine is flat against the floor. Little things like that make the difference in if you hurt yourself or make it better. If you had no prior Yoga experience, you could be doing more damage than good if you do it wrong. But her manner is pleasant and the actual moves are relaxing if you know a bit about Yoga and can make sure you are doing the moves correctly for your body type."
5,Awesome,For the price this printer can't be beat. I did a lot of online research to find an affordable photo printer and this one appeared to be the best for the price. I was not disappointed when I printed my first picture. The fact that I can replace the individual color cartridges is a bonus. Buy this one and quit looking aroung. You will be pleasantly surprised.
2,Print Head problems,"We bought 2 of these i850's January, 2003 and the one printers print head started mulfunction mid September,2003. We can take it back to the dealer but it defeats the object--it is suppose to be a good printer. The second printer was working well till last week and now started with the exact same problem--it prints different shades of blue in the same passage. We cannot afford to go without it and are thinking of going to a different brand or more reliable printer. So may be you would like to buy a printer that function well for very low volume and ""now and then"" printing. It is not working for us! In the beginning it was fine but 9-months down the line....."
2,worked for just about 15 months,"The printer head has to be replaced, it worked for almost 15 months. Also bought a Canon G3 digital camera for $600 that quit working at 13 months, conveniently when just out of warranty. Canon wants $185 to just look at the camera- repairs possibly more $. Canon has horrible customer service- buyer beware!"
1,mixer,"Warning about this mixer. I bought a cheap mixer about 2 years ago.Idid not expect it to last long, but it worked for about 2years.I thought I would buy a top of the line next and bought a Kitchen Aide.About the Third time my wife used it the switch had to be mashed three time or to come on. That lasted about two months and it finally quit.Check Amazons rating on this one and buy a different brand."
3,Not enough power,I like the mixer because it has a slow speed for starting to mix but doesn't beat fast enough after it gets going. I don't think it's powerful enough to beat too thick of batter such as pound cake or candy for extra long beatings. It seems to smell hot when the mixture is too thick.
2,Wimpy on the Wattage,"I bought this handmixer at a kitchen store in the mall. I had my prior mixer (a GE sold at Walmart) for maybe a year when the beater locking mechanism failed. I hadn't done any research on this mixer before buying it, but thought that if I bought a KitchenAid I'd be better off than buying another cheaper handmixer. When I got home the first thing I did was pop in the beaters, plug it in, and test out the 5 speeds. What a major disappointment. This thing is a WIMP! I then came on here at Amazon to read the reviews, only to find that many of you agree with me - and no wonder. It only has 72 watts, as another reviewer pointed out - something I tried to discern when purchasing it, but didn't find any mention of on the box. I should have known better, I guess. It apparently also has some issues with the locking mechanism failing. Yes, I have packaged it back up and will be returning it for a more powerful mixer."
2,Kitchen Aid Hand Mixer,"We have been using a 30 plus year old West Bend hand mixer and, although it was still working fine, felt it was time to 'upgrade'.According to Consumers Report, the Kitchen Aid hand mixer was at the top of their ratings so that is what we ordered.I made a basic apple cake with the Kitchen Aid mixer and had problems mixing butter and sugar...they didn't mix well.The problem is in the design of the beaters, I think. They are basic wire, thin, not flared as on our old West Bend model. I visited a department store and saw the Cuisinart hand mixer has the same thin wire beater design.The Kitchen Aid hand mixer is being returned; back to using the 30 year old West Bend!"
1,Broken in less than two weeks,"In less than two weeks the ""eject"" button jammed in permanent eject mode so that the beaters will not stay in place. Up until then, it worked fine for light tasks such as beating egg whites, although I agree that the higher speeds were not particularly impressive."
1,Junk,"I bought this mixer because of the name, I thought it would be a good mixer and last, but I was wrong. The speed selector switch doesn't work and the beaters turn so they hit each other. Worst piece of 50 dollar junk I have ever bought."
5,Love to cook,Makes great lemon meringue pie! Love this beater easy to use and easy to clean! So much fun to be had!
2,Good until it broke (poor quality construction),"This mixer broke after 18 months. It replaced a 20 year old mixer whose motor died, so I have to say I was pretty unimpressed. (I wish I could have just gotten an exact replacement for the old one, because it was SO much better.) I didn't use it that much; the occasional cake or brownie mix (ie I did not abuse it!). The motor is fine, and I feel bad throwing it out, but a little plastic part that holds the beater into the unit broke off, and now the beater won't stay in, making it useless.Don't waste your money on this, unless you are only planning on using it a few times and don't care if it breaks."
1,Came apart on first use!,"I bought this new in a sealed package. Thought it was a little over-priced but worth it if it would work. It fell apart the first time I used it! I used a hot glue gun to put it back together. It's still not a perfect design, but does seem to help spill a little less when I'm turning the 5 gallon jug over to put it into the cold water dispenser. Not as good as the dispenser I had previously, but I could not find it online. Too bad this company could not have better quality control."
1,Not worth the money,Pretty much worthless. The tabs had to be cut off so the bottle would fit in the hole and it leaks almost non-stop.
3,pretty but skimpy,"This fabric in no way resembles real seersucker - which isvery sturdy, and woven with a distinct crinkle. This is extremely light weight flimsy, nearly see through fabric - I will keep it because it looks ""OK"" but it will not last long. It is difficult to find robes with full length break-away zippers. I wish they were more common. It is an easy-on-and-off feature that I require. The excellent authentic seersucker one I own is 6 years old and wearing out at the shoulder. I will need to dust off my dressmaker skills and reinforce the back yoke with a strong lining. I've searched all the stores and the net for the real thing, but it is just not available anymore. I had hoped this one would be ""it"" - but it is not."
5,Seersucker Robe,I am very pleased with the quality of this robe and the speed in which I received it.I would order from this vendor again.
3,Cute but...,I like my robes large with lots of room and usually this size gives me plenty. If I could do it again I would go up one size. But all in all its very cute.
4,Good mobile...,"I have this mobile at my home. The animals are bright and cheery so they keep my daughter's attention. If you bend down and look at it from the same perspective that the little ones do, you would be amazed at how different it looks to them. The music is decent. I am sick rather tired of hearing the same 3 nursery rhymes over and over. I can see how people have problems with it tipping.... it is quite heavy.... BUT that is why you attach it securely and tug on it to make sure that it will not tip and squash the baby. When there are fresh batteries, the animals spin rather quickly which sometimes is too much stimulation for my Munchkin. She really seems to enjoy the 3d falling and climbing effect. When the little red monkey falls towards her she laughs every time.All in all, this is a rather good mobile. The only thing that would make it better is a remote like some other brands provide. It would make it just a little bit easier when I don't want her to see me."
3,Needs work,"I fell in love with this mobile, especially do to the remote feature (which I rarely used). When we received it from our registry, we installed it, and my son loved it. Then trouble started....it really didn't fit our crib properly, the arm never stayed in the same place (it seems too heavy for the unit). The final straw was when the arm would fall off and hit the baby. I returned the unit, thinking it was a lemon. When we brought the new mobile home, it started again. I called Tiny Love, who said they were getting complaints, and sent me a new, improved arm. It does work now."
4,Musician critique,"I saw this at a Babies R Us store and loved it -- it's fasinating to watch. I always try to listen to musical toys before buying them to check that they are in tune, and what I heard at the store was great. When I received this mobile as a gift a few months later, I was a bit disapointed with the quality of the intonation, though. Maybe each one is different? I think this just bothers us adults who hear it through the monitor and cringe, I don't think it will harm my daughter! Most importantly, my baby loves it. When she was 2 weeks old she found it soothing, to now (3 months old) she watchs the movement and kicks and coos! I love that it runs for 15 minutes! I would disagree with a previous review about the volume. Our options are loud or very loud. All in all, I think I would buy this again."
3,"Totally Engaged My Child, but Had Its Flaws","This mobile bought us lots of time to do stuff while our baby kicked and hooted at the characters, or simply watched them go 'round and 'round. The music sounded great, and it would have easily earned a 5-Star rating from me if not for two things: the moving parts in the blue ball section squeaked a lot, and the motor went kaput after about four months of normal use.To attest to its design and appearance, however, the mobile part (the plastic piece that twirls and holds the little animals) hangs by fishing wire over my girl's changing table. She's seven months old, and she's still mesmerized by this mobile's characters. I'd recommend it, especially over non-battery-operated mobiles, but keep a backup mobile and some WD-40 on hand!"
5,best mobile,"I have two mobiles, one with a light show for my daughters crib and this one for her cradle in the living room. she is 2 months old. in the mornings after eating she is fussy until i set her down to watch her little friends. she could be crying in my arms but as soon as she hears the soothing music she is all smiles, she will watch this until its her time to take a nap.she prefers this one over the one in her crib for fun but at night she likes to relax with the light show.this only complaint i have is the music shuts off. i wish it would stay on till i decided. but it plays for a good 15-20 minutes.i payed around 30 for mine new. i see on hear 100.00. i think that is high but if i had to pay that i would. just happy i didnt."
5,Wonderful attention getter!,"Wow! This is great! Our daughter (4 months) just loves to watch the animals spin around on this mobile. She seems to like the music and we usually play it when she goes to sleep at night. I like that the mobile/music play for about 15 minutes, it certainly gives me some time to get a few things done. The only complaint I've had with this mobile is it is hard to attach to our crib, but having gone for the design with the wider sleigh curved top rails that is my own fault. I just tied the top hook to the post with a long wire twist and it is now much more stable."
2,My son's favorite toy--but it broke!!!,"My four month old LOVES his mobile, but I am very upset because it quit turning. Evidently, this is a common problem. I would buy it again because he loves it so much, but I wish I had kept my receipt! I am going to try to call Tiny Love to see if they will replace it, but message said I would probably have to wait two weeks! What am I going to do in the mean time????"
5,Lifetime guarantee,"I purchased this mobile because of the music and the colorful design. I was a little hesitant at first because I didn't want to dish out the money for a product my daughter would only use for five months. Now I am glad I made this purchase. It is the one baby item I have not returned. Although my 2 week old has a difficult time focusing on the colorful animals, she loves the music. It seems to calm her down when she is getting cranky. I had a little problem with the way the mobile was rotating and instead of exchanging the mobile, I called the company and was completely suprised at how quick they were to please me as a customer. Without any questions, they sent me a new part with the animals. They have a lifetime guarantee on all their products. Now, most of her developmental toys are made by them. This mobile is worth every penny."
4,Too bad it broke,"I really loved this mobile. My son would go crazy with all fours going at once. He was always so excited to see it. Unfortunately, it stopped turning and I tried to fix it but it won't work any more, so I'm sending it back."
2,Fell down on my infant,"My daughter was lying in her crib, and the whole mobile came apart. Each of the three arms fell down on my one week old babies face. And the noise that the parts make startled her. I am going to have to buy an bew mobile now and I definatly will not replace it with this model."
2,doesn't fit the crib!,"This mobile looks nice, but the bulky attachment piece doesn't fit our crib! The top edge of the crib is scalloped and the mechanism bumps into the edge and won't tighten completely. My baby isn't born yet and I already have to return this. I like the motion and the music but they should streamline the design to fit different types of cribs."
2,If only the MOTOR wasn't so Loud!,We received this mobile as a gift for our daughter and the motor that turns the blue ball at the top makes a loud churning noise when used. It's very distracting and almost as loud as the music. We will be returning the mobile. Sorry to be so negative but it's not what we expected.
3,"Looks very nice, but breaks often","Seem to last only a few weeks, I am on my 3rd now. But there is nothing else out there quite like it, so I'll stick with it for now."
1,very disappointing,"I was so excited to recieve this mobile as a gift. However, it has already stopped working TWICE. I've contacted Tiny Love both times and have had the motor replaced, but my baby is only 3 months old! And we don't use it all day long. Usually, the only time my baby is in his crib awake is when I'm in the shower. He loves the colors and characters on the mobile, which is nice. But it's no fun for him to stare up at something that isn't moving at all. If I could redo my baby registry, I wouldn't bother with this mobile. For all the news about what a great item it is, it sure is a big disappointment."
1,Very Disappointing,"My husband wanted this mobile very much for our new baby. It had gotten good reviews (no hint of mechanical problems then) so we were very eager to see how she responded to it. The mobile worked well for the first 3 months and our baby absolutely loved it. After three months, I went to change the batteries when it stopped working and found that one of the batteries had leaked from the compartment and taken the paint off of the crib. I'm just glad it didn't leak down to where my daughter sleeps. After cleaning up the mess and installing new batteries, the mobile still didn't work. Then the arm fell off and landed on my daughter's head. My husband (a mechanical engineer) worked hard at trying to repair the motor; however, he was unable to solve the problem. A great concept; lousy construction"
4,Stimulating toy,"Overall, this is an excellent mobile. It is highly stimulating for my daughtrer. However, this means that it is more of a toy, not something that would help her sleep. She lays, kicks, and watches it for fifteen to thirty minutes at a time. The music is soothing and she loves the colors of the animals (especially the monkey on all Tiny Love toys). The biggest drawback is that it doesn't have a remote. My daughter would stay in her crib much longer if I could turn it on from my own bed. I hope this is something Tiny Love considers."
3,baby's opinion,"this is a bright mobile with cool shapes, but our baby was afraid of it. I think it was the angle of it, he probably thought they were coming after him. we are looking at getting another mobile, but there are so much out there, we may have to keep buying them and seeing if he likes them."
5,Best out there,"My baby loves this mobile! I originally had one that matched my bedding, but I took it back and bought this one. I am so glad I did that. The first one I had just had some bears that spun around in a circle. This one has black and white swirls underneath that really grab his attention. His grandmother has one at her house with bears, and although he likes it, he does not get as excited as he does with this one. I highly recommend this product."
2,Good idea bad product !!!,"My husband and I put this in our registry and got it. I loved it at first then we put it together to find that the mobile part wouldn't stay on the unit and would fall off in the crib(ie...where baby will lay). When our baby was born we found that he loved it but it used so many batteries we hated it. Great idea on the push button instead of wind up, we did like that. Now that my baby is 10 months old we wanted to sell it and hopefully get some money for it but we simply can't because it doesn't work anymore."
3,Like it BUT......,This is a nice product but for: those sliding do-dads. Wished that there were clips or something to stop them because it keeps my baby from falling alseep. It doesn't fit on my type of crib properly. And kinda too heavy...would have liked it to be lighter just incase it falls. Only had this for a few months so we will see. It does entertain him for awhile when he is awake which is helpful.
3,it doesn't last long,"My two month old son loves this mobile. He smiles, kicks and laughs at it and it is the only thing he will go to sleep for. However after less then two months of use it just stopped working. The sound would still play but it would no longer go around and entertain him. He screamed for hours and there was nothing I could do because the stores were closed when I discovered the problem. I was vveryb disappointed"
3,movement doesn't work,"I received this as a gift, and while it looks cute, it doesn't move at all!! I didn't know where it was purchased and so could not return it for another. I read another review here that said her movement worked, but no sound. Don't buy this as a gift for someone, unless they can return it with no problems."
1,Great idea - poor quality,"Our baby isn't even here yet & the mobile is already broken. The on/off button doesn't work properly. When it did work, the motor was very loud. The music quality was awful. I can't imagine a baby falling asleep with this mobile on. We bought it yeasterday and we will be returning it tomorrow."
1,Do not buy this!!!,"We received 2 of these mobiles and were very excited because they seemed cute and easy to put together. WRONG!!! Neither mobile worked..the music would come on, but there was no movement. I called the company who promptly sent me two new motors. Neither of these worked either. A complete and total waste of time and money!"
3,Too bad it broke!,I liked this mobile as soon as I saw it. It didn't match our nursery but I liked the colors and the music and that it's at an angle. The problem that I found is that the on/off button broke. We thought it was the batteries but we changed them and it still wouldn't turn on. I returned it and exchanged it for the same mobile since we liked it so much; now our second one has broken again. Too bad they broke because our baby really liked it. We'll try something different this time.
2,Great when it works,"This was a great purchase- for about 3 days and then the mobile stopped rotating. I took it back and replaced it with one that didn't even play music when the batteries were put in. I thought ""three times a charm"", so tried ANOTHER one and got the same results as the first (the third box I opened actually had someone else's reciept in it, so I guess someone else had problems too-- love that Babies R Us put it back on the shelf to resell!) I am going to try one more as my baby loves the thing, but don't have too much trust that another is going to last. Would suggest Tiny Love talk to their quality control dept about his one..."
2,Nice Music & Motion...when it works,"After much research, I chose this mobile for my son's crib. Since he has not arrived yet, I cannot rate it based on his reaction. But what I can rate is how it works...NOT! It was fairly easy to assemble following the directions, & the colors & music are perfect for the crib & a developing mind. However, after pushing ""on"" for only the 2nd time, nothing would happen. I switched out the entire set of batteries thinking that was the problem, & it worked again. But only for 2 more breif test runs. Went to turn it on again this morning just to see if it worked, & nothing happens again! I even changed out the batteries again, & now NOTHING happens...no music or movement. I will be returning this mobile & will choose another brand after reading the other unsuccessful reviews."
3,Great Mobile when it Works!,"We actually have two of these, one for each crib. Our son Alex absolutely loves his, but Anthony hasn't had a chance to enjoy because the mobile quit rotating within a few uses. We also had the problem of the unit falling off - though it never fell on the baby. I was debating whether or not to buy another - because Alex likes it so much, but perhaps I won't after reading other reviews where folks had the same issues. I'd hate to buy another and have the same difficulty!"
1,I have called Tiny Love for a replacement-I am still waiting,I had the same problem--the mobile part with the animals has fallen on my 5 month old's face not once...but three times!!!The last time he got a bloody boo boo and I said that's it--I am taking this thing down from the crib--I called Tiny Love and explained to them what happened and they told me that this has happened to other consumers as well--they offered to send me a replacement part for the mobile--something to due with the screw inside the tube being defective..what screw???..whatever!!!--That was on March 3rd-I am still waiting for the part--I have called 4 times--and they keep telling me its on the way--there was a back order on the replacement part..that does not sound too comforting...how many complaints have there been??? I called them AGAIN today--and I told them by the time I get the replacement part my son will be old enough to put the mobile together himself!!!!
5,A lifesaver!! My newborn's favorite toy...,My newborn son loves this mobile!! He'd stare at it for hours if I let him. The mobile plays a good amount of time without needing to be restarted and completely holds his interest and he's only 7 weeks old. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to stimulate your baby while they are in their crib.
5,Baby loves it!,"My daughter loves looking at the colorful animals and listening to the music. I wanted a mobile that was developmental instead one that just goes with a crib theme. This one is great for keeping my baby's attention, plus I think it's cute too! I haven't had any problems like the last reviewer, but it might depend on the crib. I screwed the mobile on pretty tight (it made a slight indention on the crib wood, but no big deal because it's on the back of the crib) and it is snug. It's a good idea to be careful with anything that is purchased for baby because what works for one person might not for another."
5,Mom of three rates it tops!,"I bought this mobile for my third child when she was only a few weeks old on the recommendation of a good friend. My previous children had enjoyed other static mobiles based on black and white, so I was unsure about how this mobile featuring so much movement, sound, and color would appeal to a newborn. I was wonderfully surprised at her reaction to it: smiles, coos, and rapt attention! She absolutely loves it, and I'm here now to buy one for my sister-in-law! Definitely a must-have for the nursery."
5,SUPERB!,"If all your looking for is a printer that just PRINTS, this is it! not any special features, but that leaves room for quality and SPEED!! VERY FAST, and images are EXCELLENT! And the best part is you can pick up a FULL SET (black, blue, red, and yellow) of cartridges [for a modest price]The price/performace/value CAN NOT BE BEAT! Canon is king of inkjets!"
4,Almost perfect,"Made it home bouncing in the big box, but got OK. The lower paper tray in not complete, or comes from a different printer, but I happened to still have my broken printer and swapped the part. When we purchase things, we expect they to be complete. But Hey! I just had returned another defective printer. This one prints fine, and I am happy with the purchase. Thanks."
1,What a hassle!,"I too bought the i550 based on the raving reviews and had nothing but trouble.When we first installed the printer it printed a beautiful 4x6 picture on the free sample paper. After that it never worked again! I uninstalled, reinstalled, called tech support and got nothing but problems for 2 weeks. In the end the computer illiterate ""tech support"" at canon told me I had a bad print head and needed to go to a local area provider to have it replaced. I packed it back up in the box and sent it back to amazon."
1,Don't Buy This Printer,"From the start, this printer would not print a single page until the print head cleaning program was run. Every single page you print requires another cleaning. Technical "" services "" offered me detailed instructions on how to run the clean program ( after I had run it at least 60 times ! ) After a "" repair "" by my local authorized service center, I was able to print 4 consecutive pages before I had to clean the heads again. Tech service now says the wrong part was replaced, and they'll send me another. The authorized service center had 3 more of this model on the counter for the same problem when I visited. Canon obviously has a design flaw they're not addressing yet. Don't buy it!"
3,"I Still Prefer ""The Spirit Room""","""Hotel Paper"" ain't bad either,but somehow Michelle still fared better in her 1st self-titled album.Her voice is still as folksy as ever,which gives the opportunity to her considerable guitar skills.My fave's tracks on ""Hotel paper"" are ""Breathe"" and ""One Of These days"".I still missed her unforgetable pop-rock ballad tunes from ""Spirit room"",like ""Everyhwere"",""All You Wanted"",""Goodbye To You"" and ""You Get Me"".They are best to be played in the blues!!!"
3,Not Bad...Not Great,"Not bad for a girl that is only 19 years old. Hotel Paper is better then her first cd The Spirit Room. It pretty much follows the same formula but has more mature lyrics then her first record. Like Spirit Room, I expect 2 or 3 radio hits. If you like her first cd, then you will like this one just as much if not better."
4,more Michelle Branch,This cd took a while for me to get used to. but after a while i liked it a lot. the cd is slower than the first but still has good tunes. all of the songs are pretty good. The only song i don't really like is hotel paper. besides that they are all good songs. more confessional lyrics.
2,Dissapointing,"Hotel Paper, Michelle Branch's 2nd album, starts with the angry, cathy Are You Happy Now but soon turns into a huge disapointment. The songs all sound very much alike and fail to grab your attention. Even the extra tracks - Everywhere, and the Game of Love - can't save this album.The Spirit Room is one of my favourite albums of all time and I've listened to it countless times without getting bored. I've listened to Hotel Paper only twice and won't be listening to it again.Save your money and PASS on this one."
5,Nice addition,"She's young, talented, bright, enthusistic in and for her art, and full of musicality. I've listened to every track. I drive a lot and have a chance to really listen to each track. This album was not an improvement over the first album as other say, but an addition to the first. There were some new edgier flavors in Hotel Paper like track 2 and a lot more fire fueling the album's musical message. Her music really speaks to a greater audience than her contemporaries and her she shows how well she can do that. This album reflects her growing maturity as a real musician not a phony cosmetics dress up doll. When her contemporaries are coming up with new ideas, Branch will have already been there and done that. Keen thing here, she doesn't need the fancy cosmetic surgery or thrill rides to sell her music. So what's next? Stick around, I am sure we'll be surprised each time. Definte 5!"
4,Branch finds success in Sophomore album,"In 2001, Michelle Branch appeared on the music scene with her debut album, THE SPIRIT ROOM. Although it spawned three hit singles, the album only peaked in the 20's. HOTEL PAPER, Branch's second album debuted at #2, and is worth all of it and more. This album shows Branch's maturity in a larger state than of its predecessor, showing that Branch is a real teenage girl, dealing with teenage type issues. A much stronger album, HOTEL PAPER is full of ""stuck in your head"" hits, and shows that Michelle Branch should be here to stay."
1,whyyyyyy!????,"go to speech therapy, michelle...and learn how to write songs and sing and.....eh, why dont you just quit...you'd do quite well as a k-mart clerk"
4,Better yet,I bought the Spirit Room and while there is some good music on it and it has stayed in my CD player I never thought it was a great CD. Hotel Paper is a step up and out for Michelle who has added to her musical dimensions while losing none of the rockin' attitude she has always had.
2,disappointing follow-up to Spirit Room,"I enjoyed Michelle Branch's debut album, The Spirit Room. It was full of catchy, guitar-driven songs. I downloaded her sophomore album, Hotel Paper, from iTunes. It was disappointing. The song material wasn't as good as Spirit Room. I found many of the songs too drab."
2,A bit disappointing. =/,"Having heard 'Are You Happy Now' and liking it tremendously, I bought this CD. I was anticipating a sound similar to the Spirit Room - something fresh, uplifting.Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. The only two tracks that I liked from the start were 'Are You Happy Now' and 'Breathe' upon listening to the CD. For some reason, many of the songs on the CD sound like each other (or are some variant of each other).It's a mediocre CD. Nothing really to jump out at you. I truly hope Michelle's next CD (if there is going to be one) is better than this. She's much more creative and talented than what she portrays herself on this CD to be."
5,AWESOME,"Michelle Branch is SOOO talented. I mean, she's a singer/songwriter who plays the guitar and like seven other different insturments. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT PEOPLE!"
4,Uhh...,OK well if uve seen my review for the first CD ull know i DO NOT hate Michelle Branch.But her music isnt as good as on the first album.It seems kinda boring and i dont like to listen to the whole thing.Id rather listen to her old CD.I rarely ever listen to this CD and when i do i never listen the whole thing through.I wanted to give this a 3 but since i like Michelle i gave it a 4 instead.The only songs the stood out were Breathe and Are you happy now?Well if u like Michelle you would be better off buying her first album.
1,not what I excpected,I thought the album was okay. There are afew songs worth hearing. But i excpected more when I heard there was a duet with Ms.Crow. But overall when I first bought the album I was so excited I played it on my way home. Honestly its good to listen to but nothing really sticks out about it.
1,sad to give her a 1 star...,I've always liked Michelle Branch for some reason...So I was very excited when I heard her new single and ran out get the album.Wow. Are You Happy Now is great...the rest of the album is just plain awful. sorry :-/ I wish I could like it......
2,"If you want a boring album, it's for you","I listened to this once. All the songs sound the same. Guitar and vocals. Yawn. Get something better like Daniel Bedingfield ""Gotta Get Thru This"" or Ashanti ""Chapter II""."
2,"Not bad, but not Spirit Room","I love Michelle Branch, but this CD just isn't as good as Spirit Room. That said, if you're a fan - buy it."
2,Typical Sophomore C.D.,"Michelle Branch's 2nd album is exactly what one would expect-- a musician required by her label to release another LP does so while she's touring the country. The point is- the foundation on which she writes these songs have nothing to do with life as we know it, but the life of a teenage vocalist who made it big. They are essentially bonus tracks of the last album, as she makes no attempts to expand or develop her style. Her first album was nearly 10 years in the making, as many lyrics and melodies were adapted from things she'd been writing since she was young. Listeners of ""paper"" will even sense a lack of enthusiasm from Ms. Branch herself, she trudges through her 2nd album as if she knows its only purpose is to be a place holder for the notoriously cursed sophomore slot. Save your money for her third one, or buy another copy of her first."
2,you cantwash the blood from your hand,"the sermon is good , but I need it on cd, do anybody know where I can buy this on cd. urgent really need"
4,leaves you smiling,"I can assume that I am one of many that hadn't heard of Kimya Dawson until Juno, and ""Remember That I Love You"" features most of the songs she contributed to the soundtrack. I expected that these songs would all be the standouts, and though Loose Lips is possibly still the best song on the album with a catchy-as-hell chorus and cheery tune, the whole album is strong start to finish.I'm usually one to go for punk, hardcore, metal and the like, but the fact that this is acoustic and more pop than the Moldy Peaches wasn't a factor - I enjoyed especially ""My Mom"", ""Underground"" and ""I Like Giants"", as well as Tire Swing, Loose Lips and the full version of My Rollercoaster, which even features a little Metallica reference.This isn't music that I'd typically listen to, but I loved it. Definitely worth the purchase."
1,Stocking delivered was not as shown,"Ordered this product about a month before X-Mas. Product was delivered in about a week, but it wasn't the Stocking I ordered. The stocking is supposed to be a one big paw print in the shape of a paw, however, what I received was a normal stocking with 3 paw prints printed on it. Certainly nothing like the novelty I was looking for."
4,Good product but BEWARE,"I ordered this stocking for my boyfriend after reading quite a few reviews on it first. One review said the small stocking is about the same size as a traditional human Christmas stocking. True, it is about the same length, but BEWARE! The width of the stocking is very narrow and the material does not stretch. I couldn't fit much in it, but that's not to say you couldn't fit enough little gifts in it for your furry friend this Christmas. Overall the stocking is very cute and looks just like the picture. I would recommend this product to a friend for either their dog or a human who's not getting much for Christmas this year."
3,I guess you get what you pay for.,"i received this product today...and it is quite stiff and doesn't wrap ""that"" well around my office chair nor fit its contours very well...While i'm guessing this does provide support, i don't feel ""comfort"" from it. Memory foam? I don't think so, and if it is, it's too stiff and crappy. I have a tempur pedic mattress at home, and this memory foam doesn't even remotely compare to the comfort I experience with my bed. The idea that this supportive back cushion featured Memory Foam was a major plus to me in my purchase decision...and i'm disappointed by that, yet i guess not too surprised. You get what you pay for. I was just Hoping it'd be better. I don't really recommend this."
2,"Didn't work, had to return","This is a cute little printer but I can't say much about performance...the paper feeder on mine was completely defective. The paper feeder didn't move at all and I just emailed Amazon.com to return it. Oh well, it was worth a try."
3,some problems about its rebate,"the printer is somewhat good, but it never return the rebate it promised to me after nearly 3 months! and I cannot find any help from them"
5,Love it!,"I loved this little printer but sadly they don't make it anymore. Nice picture quality, inexpensive ink. It's a little noisy but for the price and performance, very acceptable."
4,An Average Printer...,"I bought this printer because my old canon stopped working. This printer prints ok, but it is noisy. It warms up like everytime i would print. But overall, for the price of replacement ink cartridges, it is a pretty nice printer."
5,Awesome Tool!,Bought this for stereo removal on the 2002 Honda Civic. This worked great and was able to remove the unit without damage.
2,Eh.,"I knew it was temporary, but it hardly showed up at all and lasted a day. Maybe on blonde hair it would last and show up longer, but anything beyond a light brown and you really will need Manic Panic or something."
4,Lots of fun!,"Look, Jimmy Sturr is not hip or cool - but his music is very enjoyable. His arrangements tend to be loud and definitely reflect an understanding of rock music - which makes them great for playing at parties or in the car."
4,Good replacement,"It a good choice for replace an old cutter blade.I would prefer that its color was the showed in the photo, not black."
1,piece of junk,"The cover is very cheap, it ripped the first time I put it on the grill. That small tear ripped completely up the side soon after. The positive thing is it fits the size it says it will."
2,Thin and not durable,"For the price, I guess this was a decent quality. After just two uses, the seams have split in three spots and the fabric is so thin you have to be extremely careful that it won't catch on anything while putting it on or taking it off the BBQ."
1,grilproi grill cover,would not buy again.torn all apart in first rain stonmmy old cover lasted 4 years.this product is awful.would never buy again
1,Are you people on crack?,"My boyfriend and I decided to take a chance on a gay movie, knowing that most usually suck. After seeing all the positive reviews, we decided on this supposed winner. ARE YOU PEOPLE FOR REAL?! This was quite possibly the worst gay movie I've ever seen. After the first 45 minutes of nonsense, the only time we bothered to even look at the screen was for the sex scenes.Gays, be warned. Unless you're on crack, this movie will suck 1.5 hours from your life."
1,Not A Good Movie,"Do not buy the movie. The movie is not good and waste the money. The plot is so-so, the acting is weak. The casts are not attractive (except the main character and maybe 2 more supporting casts). Sex scenes are not excited at all. Again, sorry that I have to rate the movie this bad. I wish I can return the DVD and get my money back."
2,Longer Life???,I used these batteries in microphones and did not see a significant longer life that standard alkaline batteries. Maybe 1.2 times but not 5 times longer.
2,3 of 7 dead at 1 year.,I purchased 7 of these for our smoke detectors in Aug. 2010. One of the detectors began chirping with a dead battery at about 8 months. Two others went dead in the last week (Aug. 2011).
1,quick tip to make these last...,"as you have all figured out by now, this handle is garbage. Moen should be embarrassed for making it. I bought a 1/2"" copper pipe (it's about an inch long) for a buck at a local hardware. I think it's called a coupling pipe. It fits over the part that always breaks to support the plastic (I glued it on since it's not an exact fit). I don't know if it'll last forever, but it's better than buying a sixth handle."
1,Total waste of time and money,"This movie seemed and sounded so promising and the preview looked spectacular. However, it was a total bust and fizzled. Almost $19 burst into flame. If you want to punish yourself buy the movie. If you want to punish someone else invite him to see the movie."
2,Not bad but I've seen better.,Not as good as Hero or Crouching Tiger but along the same line. The backgrounds relied too much on computer generated models. I was really impressed with Hero and crouching Tiger but I guess I'm just not Matial Arts movie fan. I'll go back to my Kung Fu TV show from the 70s.
4,Great flash fiction,"Only a small number of writers can pull off high quality flash fiction in piece after piece. People like Rikki Ducornet, Barry Yourgrau, W.S. Merwin, Lydia Davis, and Moacyr Scliar come to mind. Jessica Treat--judging by this excellent collection--is another. Her writing is pungent, lively, and smart. The essence of flash fiction is like a photo--capturing moments, flashes, as they are, as they happen, as they come to you, me, whomever. This is what Jessica Treat can do--and does--in her writing.Look at the way she handles people interacting with and reacting to each other--it's super-keen. Look at how she uses details to tell more than what the detail itself is. Very nifty.Interestingly, her second collection of stories veered away from flash to the more conventional short story form. But for me, this collection is the prize. In fact, I would say it's one of the top ten American collections of flash fiction in the last 15 years.Highly recommended."
1,Do Not Purchase This Product!,Purchase at your own risk!Product was defective out of the box. Had a defective Software CD and very poor print quality with the first two print pages smudged with traces of black toner.
2,Not worth the money.,I would not suggest you spend $$$ on this camera. I purchased it hoping to capture some of the most important events in my daughers life and I was extremely disappointed. It has now stopped working altogether without any warning. I thought for the money I was going to have this camera for longer than 3 years. Most of the pictures I took with this camera were left at the processing counter. I would say if you like to gamble then make the purchase. I have recently purchased an Olympus for half the price and the pictures are 10x better. I hope my review helps. Good luck with your camera hunt.
1,Poor quality,This camera is the worst investment that I have ever made. I would rather spend another hundred dollars on a camera that works well. I have wasted 4 rolls of film and one of the rolls of film being my spring break. If you are looking for a camera that will have pictures turn out...I would look else where.
5,Remarkable lens,"I've been very happy with the lens for my H-1, which has made my camera more versabile. Thanks."
5,Awesome photos,My family loves soccer - and loves this book. It has beautiful photos and quotes. We've givien it as a gift to coaches.
2,"Not nearly as good as ""Sabbathday River""!","When ""Sabbathday River"" came out, I read it twice and loaned it to all my friends. It was an almost perfect book: mystery, love affair -- it literally kept me up half the night. THIS book, on the other hand, was not interesting at all, and I thought it was a bit pretentious."
5,"Live deeper, not faster","It's the 900 pound gorilla in America that everyone should be talking about: time poverty. Most folks accept it as unavoidable; that's just the way life is. Work, work, work. Busy, busy, busy. Bulloney, says this book. I'm not doing too bad but I see the trappings of modern existence creeping into my life and I'm inspired to keep them in check. This book is particularly strong because it draws on the opinions of many progressive thinkers, rather that just one lone voice in the wilderness. Stop buying stuff, invest time in your family and community and civic society. Live deeper. I'm working on it. Are you?"
4,Men and Sex is the best sex manual for men...period.,"This is an invaluable guide to men who really want to make something of their sex life. It is written from a Christian perspective making it especially valuable and unique, but non-Christians will benefit too.The book approaches sexuality from the position that it is the man's action which ultimately dictate the level of fulfillment in a sexual relationship when he is sensitive enough to be guided by the woman. Men and Sex makes a very strong case that women must embrace their own sexuality and be freed by the man to express it for the relationship to be truly satisfying.In short, this is probably the best guide to a sexually fulfilling relationship a man is likely to find anywhere."
3,Nice suit but not for me.,62 yrs old size 10 but this cut suit was not for me! I feel better in the Speedo conservative cut for my lap swimming.
4,tight but that is how it fits best in water,Arrived as expected. Its good quality as Speedo always is. Lines are trimming. I do rinse every time I wear so it will hold up longer
4,Nice fit but wears a bit thin.,I loved this suit and the lines are very flattering. It was comfortable and the colors held up well under the chlorine. My only complaint is that after 7 or 8 months of regular use for lap swimming the fabric in the back wore really thin and it became unwearable.
4,Nice fit but size up,I ordered one size bigger than usual based on other reviews. I suggest going up two sizes. The suit fits nicely once it is on but is pretty difficult to get on and even worse to get off.I am 5 '3 and weigh 105 lbs. I ordered a size 32 and could have worn a 34 easily
1,To small for the size,"I orswe size 14 just to be in the saver side; my swiming costume are between size 10 to 12, but I was very desepointed by Speedo brand they aren't as good as I thought."
1,"Not 3"" clamp. Not as pictured.","While the quality of the product appears great, the item came up when doing a search for 3"" muffler clamps. It is actually a 2 1/4"" band style muffler clamp."
3,DanceMaker II,"The dance mat is a great idea, but its durability is poor. rated for ages 5 and up, my 5yr and 7yr played on it and the mat came apart from the controller. it needs work."
1,Didn't have a chance to test the no fog...,"My guess would be this mirror works very well as a fog less mirror. I wouldn't know, because the valve that controls water flow to the mirror burst within two minutes the first time I used it.The valves on this product are obviously of poor quality. Water was leaking from both valves when I first installed the mirror. When I went to play with the valve that turns water on and off to the mirror itself, that valve burst.This seems like a very good idea, but this product is poorly manufactured."
4,Handy Shaving Mirror,"I've used ShowerTek's Fog Free Mirror for years. Yes, its shell and componenets (except for the mirror, of course)are made of plastic but the device holds up extremely well. I won't buy any other make. Its price is great and gives perfect performance for which it is designed. Please note: when first installed the mirror component has a bit of a struggle to stay in place. After a few showers, it tightens up and works fine."
2,David's development is not the one wanted,"Everyone loved songs like ""Seven Days"" from Craig Daid's dabut yet im not sure that many will find his new tunes equally appealing. I didn't like the specific collaboration with Sting-frankly i dont think there's the chemistry needed between their voices . Do prefer the Sugarbabes&Sting cd-single instead ."
3,Edited Version,"This is the second movie that I purchased from Amazon that has edited content. The Note aired on the Hallmark Channel with words that have been substituted in the DVD that I purchased from Amazon. It is disconcerting to watch the actors say words that are not reflected in the audio of the DVD. I wouldn't have purchased the DVD from Amazon if I had known they would not carry the original version. I will be purchasing a DVD of this movie from the Hallmark Channel, but will ensure that it is the full original version before I buy it."
3,Collection of love songs,"In 2001 Virgin decided to release this single-disc retrospective for Valentine's Day, even if I don't know if the artists have really been involved in this project. It isn't bad, since it contains many hits like ""Ti sento"", ""Solo tu"", ""Stasera che sera"" and ""Stringimi"", and there are also two rare tracks: ""Cercami ancora"", which isn't available elsewhere (I suppose it was a b-side) and ""I feel you"" (the English version of their hit ""Ti Sento""). The songs are all sung by Antonella Ruggiero, one of the very best female singers Italy has ever had. The title-track and ""Amami"" have never been hits and they were never released as singles, but they are excellent (""Sentimentale"" has a perfect arrangement, mixing electronic elements and a romantic sax; ""Amami"" can be easily compared to Ultravox songs like ""Visions in Blue"").I would advise to skip this one in favour of the more complete ""Studio Collection"", released in 2002..."
5,Appropriate for all spiritual paths,"I found an original 1987 copy of this book at a small book store in my town. To my suprise, this is one of the most inspirational books I have read. The book starts off with basic information and exercises on developing your imagination and sensory perception and along the way takes you deeper and deeper into your own psyche. Some of the exercises are long and a bit complicated, but worth the effort. Her ideas and theories on spirituality can easily fit any spiritual path or belief system. This is an excellent book to use as a reference for a spiritual development group. Many of the exercises can be incorporated into such a group or be performed alone. This is a wonderful book that can act as a catalyst for emotional, psychological, and spiritual growth and development."
1,RUINED MY DREAMS NO EFFECT NEITHER POST ACNE NOR NEWLY DEVELOPING,i ws very excited to try this product & first 2 times it seemed tht my dream of getting rid of acne & acne scars is just few days ahead bt nope it didnt do anything just to make it work efficiently i bought entire DCL line which has active cleanser this gel & a clearing hydrator after reading reviews i trusted this libe blindly am 22 years old Asian Wid acne -prone skin that has few scars to be treated bt this product didnt work 4 me :(*****
1,Nothing yet,"I've been using this product for about two months now and have had 0 results. I thought it was fast working and effective but I've found no results in the lightening of the dark chicken pox scars on my face. The first week I experienced significant drying and peeling so I pulled back on using the product. I'm still going to use it since I bought it and I hate wasting money so maybe results will come eventually but two months into the product,so far no good."
2,Updated version available from the same author,"Don't waste your money on this particular copy of the book. An updated translation is available, including revisions to the layout, introduction, and footnotes. The book is called ""Zhuangzi"" and is the same exact thing as ""Chuang Tzu""; the newer version, available here on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Zhuangzi-Basic-Writings-Burton-Watson/dp/0231129599/) is from 2006, whereas this older version is from the mid 1990s, and is a few dollars cheaper, at the time of writing this review.I did not know this going in and had to return the Chuang Tzu.Hope this helps."
2,Not the best for the serious user,"I bought this for a young US medical student who has a Brazilian husband and plans to work in Brazil. Someone else gave her Stedman's expensive one, which she loves--and she doesn't even look at this one. When I gave her the Nolte-Schlegel dictionary, I told her that it was for reading rather than reference, because I had read that its coverage was hit-or-miss, and having just seen both books and the recipient using just the one, while I looked in Nolte-Schlegel, I agree. This one looks as if it may still be useful to introduce someone to medical vocabulary, and of course it includes Spanish."
1,worse movie ever,The movie had the worse plot with cheesey graphics and fight scenes that had no chance of looking half way realistic. We could not figure the point to this movie even after the end credits were rolling but we laughed all the way thru this to keep from destroying the tv. The only good thing about this movie was the title and the names of the characters supposze to be in the movie. If not for the semi rape scenes we would have completely hated this movie. We guessed that was the only way to show women parts but please don't let that be a reason to waste your time or money on this collection.
1,Crap!,"I just finished watching the first 30 minutes of this movie, and had to turn it off. I simply could not watch 1 more minute of this so called movie. The story was horrible, the acting was horrible, the camera work was horrible, the fight scenes horrible, and the special effects...hmm...HORRIBLE!Please don't waste your time with this one, you'll be sorry if you do."
1,inu no kuso da yo!,"This is THE WORST Japanese film I've ever seen. Bad script, bad plot, bad acting, and stupid special effects! Why waste our time by importing aweful films like this, when there are hundreds of GOOD films that haven't even been made available with English subtitles?About the title:KUNOICHI: Write out hiragana KU, katakana NO, and kanji ICHI, with the characters overlayed, and you end up with ONNA, the kanji for ""female.""Deadly Mirage: The Mirage is that this film might be entertaining, and the danger being how close you come to wanting to commit ritual suicide while watching."
2,Really really really small letters,The letters are very small. I am not sure how a person would make things with them. They also had a lot of rust on them.
2,What I received was not what I ordered,I ordered the punch packs of lozengers based on the picture of the product displayed. These are much easier to carry with you. What I received was the tube packs. These are harder to carry with you.
2,"Minus 2 Stars for Misleading Title, Minus 1 Star for Music","the way i understand ""lounge music"" is, it should be a soothing kind of music. well, about 1/4 of the cd really gives you downtempo sound. the rest is just the opposite."
2,Don't expect a big candle,"The candle is no larger than a shot glass. For the price, I was expecting something much larger. Perhaps I should have read the fine print a bit closer, as when this arrived I was almost sure they had made a mistake. The packaging is nice, the delivery of quick... but the candle was just very very small."
5,Who Knew?,"Where has this film been? The conversion to English is great, leaving the film largely intact. The print/color is poor. An early attempt at colorization. Still, it's a great movie, easily ranking with the original Japanese version of Godzilla."
3,"Works just fine, but...","...it's not the best way to go. If you want to download pics to your PC, you're better off owning a cheaper and more portable card reader, which just slips into any computer's USB port and accepts the memory card from the camera, using the PC's power to do the image transferring.I don't think this gadget makes sense unless you are planning on shooting while plugged into a wall socket or unless you are planning on running a slide show directly from your digicam to a TV/monitor."
5,A Must Read,"What an amazing and inspiring book on the importance of lifestyle changes for optimal health. The book offers an in-depth but practical look at the importance of eating low glycemic, taking a high quality vitamin, and moderate exercise. Using Dr. Strand's book and Usana Health Sciences, I have lost over 65 lbs and feel great. I love my new lifestyle, and for me this is the only thing that has ever worked to lose weight. I am a huge advocate for this book and think that even if you don't need to lose weight it is a lifestyle that promotes optimal health."
3,"Not worth more than what I paid for it, cheap webcam, worth it","Can't mention how much I paid for it (amazon policy), but the only reason I got this cam cause it was so cheap (on sale + rebate). I piggybacked it with some other items so I didn't pay any shipping either.Other than that, the other reviewers have summed it up, one thing i'd like to mention is that you can actually remove the outer casing of this cam and you will be surprised to see how small the actual camera is, you can fit it into a mini matchbox."
2,Bad picture quality,"This camera has really terrible picture quality. I promptly returned it and picked up a creative labs webcam live, which is soooo much better. I would not even reccomoned this camera as a beginner cam. Somtimes price dictates quality, as is the case with this camera."
3,webcam a bit fuzzy,This webcam is probably a good value for the money. I found it to have a fuzzy image and never could get the color values correct for the image projected.
2,Cheaply made,This web cam broke soon after we got it. It is worth paying a little bit more for one that will last. Quality of picture was just okay but the construction is really bad.
3,Earlier Version Of Without A Prayer,"Some years ago I reviewed John Robbins' book WITHOUT A PRAYER, a critique of Ayn Rand's philosophy. As I said, the book is hit or miss. The same could be said about the first version of WITHOUT A PRAYER, ANSWER TO AYN RAND.There is no reason to purchase a used copy of this book unless you are, like me, an Ayn Rand ""completist.""Criticism of Rand has gotten better over the years. Scott Ryans' book (OBJECTIVISM AND THE CORRUPTION OF RATIONALITY) and Greg Nyquist's book (AYN RAND CONTRA HUMAN NATURE) are both competent.Robbins was a follower of the rationalist Calvinistic philosopher Gordon Clark, whose books are much superior to anything Robbins wrote."
5,Barebones,To anyone who likes to laugh and cry all in one sitting I reccommend this book to you. A great novel; Diane Baker Mason really knows how to pull you into her characters and become attached to their unique personalities. A fantastic read from beginning to end......GO DEE
3,Watch this vendor,Purchased this Polar watch from Heart Monitors USA for my wife. As soon as she saw felt it would be too complicated and sent it back without ever opening the box. When I got my credit from these guys is was $28 short of what I paid. They said this was for the shipping cost and would not be included in the refund. I was out the $28 (plus the 8 bucks I had to shell out to send it back.)So beware of these clowns taking your money if you decide you want to return the product.
3,TERRIBLE sound on track one.,"I would have rated this at 5 stars had I not been shocked to the point of laughing in disbelief at the noise that was supposed to be the first episode of this collection. With out exageration there was NOT ONE SINGLE WORD of dialog one could make out. (this was even through a high-end Sony system with very high quality B&W speakers) Why even put this on the collection??!! Especially as the FIRST episode!?Every actor sounded as if they were being smother by a big THICK pillow. I don't think there was a single frequency above 600hz. Other tracks were fine and enjoyable (none were great sound quality, but that is to be expected). I just felt that tis was a deliberate rip off; how anyone think that this was anything more that 20 minutes of noise, maybe human, who knows.."
3,Effinger's Zork,"Well, it's a fun book to read. It's interesting and the humor is original. Actually, I suppose it's not original since it's taken from Zork. What bothers me is that the book is written too similar to the video game. The Great Underground Empire is divided into rooms separated by passageways that go in the usual cardinal directions. That makes it easier for video game players to play Zork but isn't the book supposed to be a bit more realistic? An underground kingdom shouldn't just be a bunch of rooms."
3,A Glossary of Sufi Technical Terms,"This is a translation of the Is-stillahat wa Al-Ishahraht Al-Sufiat which is originally written in Arabic. Although this text is a bilingual edition I find the translator had some difficulty with the sufi concepts. It gives a general idea of the meanings but the depth is still lacking. The format follows the original to a degree but challenges the novice to know exactly how to use it and gain the important meanings. It is a first translation and hopefully there will be a second edition. Still, for those in need of Sufi terms it will give many what they need. It would be better though if the reader would go directly to the Arabic text."
5,This is my all-time favorite album by any one in the game.,"I have been listening to rap every since I can rember and I have to say that this album is best there is. Im from the $outh so there is not a whole lot of people that will agree, with all the master p hype that is going around. I believe that Bo-loc is being robbed!"
1,What a bore!,"After listening to ""Pentastar: In the Style of Demons"", I gladly purchased this record. What a mistake. Pentastar had the mix of ambient/rock the last reviewer is speaking of. How anyone can listen to Earth 2 more than 5 minutes and remain interested is beyond me. The ""music"" is just...fuzz. I guess if one were ""medicated"", he/she could enjoy this record."
5,amazing,"This is one of my favorite albums, 70+ minutes of some of the most awesome guitar sound you've ever heard. some people will believe this to be boring, so if you don't like slow instrumental heavy music don't get this. however, if you do like the afformentioned style, this is absolutely the best ever created. yes, sunn O))) is heavier, but this is still fantastic drone doom."
4,Great follow-up story marred by bad rewrite,"I consider myself a well read fellow. With that in mind I say in all honesty that Moonshadow is the most moving and important books I have ever read. Having first read the story as a teen in 1985 I identified strongly with the honest story telling of the transition of boy to man. Now this volume adds to the first by adding a story of Moonshadow's adult years. It is as brilliant and moving as the first and all the more meaningful to me now as I am maturing, as well.HOWEVER: Be WARNED! The ending of the first story, Moonshadow's jouney to awakening, has been vandalized with a rewrite. The last pages have been stained with changed dialog and excessive narration that dilute the meaning and convert a thoughtful exploration of the transendant into a parade of cliche's. I recommend this book for the additional Moonshadow tale but, to get the full value from this wonderful tale one needs to seek out the original volumes with the original text and meaning."
4,Great little hub,"I'm very pleased with the D-link USB Hub. I like the small size of it. I definately like the price. I use mine for my PDA cradle, eMarker, Nomad II, and for my PC link for my minidisc player. All work fine on the hub. Stylin clear cover is a plus. Although the instructions are a little...sketchy, after a few miniutes, you get it working. And I do wish all of the connections were on one side. The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it could use something, like 4 peices of rubber, to make it STAY to where you place it. I highly recommend it."
3,Not all USB products are compatible with this hub,"While this hub installed easily and works without much interaction, I've found that there are many USB products that will only work when plugged directly into the computer (and fail completely when plugged into this hub). Some examples are the Microsft wireless optical mouse (which is the whole reason I bought this hub), my HP writable DVD drive and an M-Audio audio interface.I'm not sure if this is the fault of D-Link or the other manufacturers, but there are enough products that will not work with it that I wonder about the compatibility of this hub."
4,self-powered option,"The Amazon description doesn't mention it, but this product is packaged with an AC adapter and can be self-powered rather than taking power from your PC's USB bus. This means that the hub can supply lots of power to connected USB devices. USB hubs without the self-power option cannot reliably support devices with a high current draw..."
2,Self Power,"My computer has 2 usb ports, but I needed 4, so I bought the unit. My computer was on when I first plugged it to my usb port. Then I plugged it into the wall, so it would become self powered, and it worked fine for that session. But when I pressed shut down and then tried to turn it on again... The power button was useless, it didn't work. I had to run the unit on non-self powered mode for my computer to run correctly.I don't know if this is my computer's fault, or just the unit.But otherwise it works as advertised.Thanks D-Link"
1,Very uncomfortable,"These headphones were not only very uncomfortable, but they also caused the targus in both of my ears (that bit of cartilage that covers the ear canal) to get red and swollen. Very unhappy"
1,Save your money,"Sometimes one can get lucky with a cheap purchase, not this time. The construction is adequate and they are comfortable, but the sound quality is bad."
2,Un-satisfied,"I had expected this product to be a perfect gift for my Mom, because her old headphones had broken.When you place the headphones in your ear, only one of them goes in smoothly and stays there without hurting the ear, and the other side goes into your ear and scratches it, and as it stays in your ear it hurts more and more as you walk and try to exercise with it.It irritates the ear as you leave it in there.My mom was unsatisfied with the product.. not the greatest headphones you can get for this price.."
2,Only if you're a fan of bluegrass and roots music,"I LOVE Fred. I think his live album ""Ralph's Last Show"" is one of my favorite albums and I play it constantly. Trying to build my collection of Fred's music I bought this one.Perhaps I should have read the reviews more closely I wouldn't have bought this album. But, I did.So, if you've seen him live and you love his hard-drivin style (49 tons of diesel locomotive couldn't drag me back to you!) you will be disappointed in this album. But, if you're a real bluegrass fan and want to hear Fred's more rootsy side, then you probably will like it.That said, I can't wait to see Fred again live."
1,Engaño,"La presente es para informarles que al adquirir el capo 2 y la Reina del Sur 2, esperabamos era la Segunda parte de la serie, pero no es asi, por lo tanto estamos totalmente insatisfechos, Podemos decir que no estan vendiendo lo que ofrecen, esto es un engaño"
1,Where is the Subtitles,"On the Product details say has English Subtitles but it doesnt, if you spainsh is not too good, dont buy, as the speak pasia spainsh."
1,Total engaño El Capo 2,"Cuando adquirí el producto lo hice esperando que fuera el Capo 2 tal como lo indicaba la imagen, se bien el producto se encuentra en buenas condiciones pero no es lo que esperaba, pues compre pensando que realmente era la segunda parte por lo tanto es una total estafa."
2,Is this guy superman?,"I was not very impressed with what Brother Lawrence says in this book. It is wonderful to share one's insight about their relationship with God, but he mentions nowhere in the book that I saw, any of his stuggles. I got the impression that he was perfect, which I know is not the case. Not your best read, in my opinion, if you're looking for humility."
3,bored,I got bored really quickly and wished I hadn't ordered it. It's okay I guess but not my thing and it seemed like a rich kid telling some aspect of their life that has no broad appeal.
2,moog sway bar link,grease fitting hole was stripped for new fitting and did not fit correct was the only problem with this link
4,Transitional period on the horizon,"This 1976 release from the band continues to capture that early to mid 70's Jazz-Funk that had made Kool&The Gang popular,however on this release featuring the lush vocals of the all-female vocal group ""Something Special"" the sound is more R&B with hints of Disco in the midst. Most diehard 70's Kool&The Gang fans should still be satisfied with the work the group layed out on this release,there is a wealth of great material on this late 70's gem. This reissue features 3 bonus versons of album tracks,and a nicely edited booklet of photos and informaton."
4,Excellent watch except for one thing...,"I've used Casio Databank 150 watches for many, many years. I got this watch to use at the office because it had a dressier look. While I am happy with this watch, it has one major flaw which has been mentioned by most other reviewers... the light sucks BIG time!! You can see the hour and barely see the minutes if you are dependent on the light. If you want to see the seconds, wait til you have another light source or forget it. The light on the Databank 150 is like the sun compared to this light. If you need to see your watch at night a lot, get the silver 150. I am buying another 150 for use at night and on weekends."
4,Great Intro,"This book offered me a great introduction and guidance in learning a very complex, but useful personality test. Definitely recommended for beginning students."
5,Great Set!,"This set is an excellent way to get all of the major Brahms piano works. It is not actually ""complete,"" since it does not include some of his smaller piano works. The piano sound is good. I really enjoyed these CDs, and would recommend them to anyone interested in these pieces."
3,Seconds parts dilemma!,"Once upon a time a film whose title was Rollerball; directed by Norman Jewison and superbly starred by James Caan.Two generations after in 1998 came Future sport, a picture which remains in the middle of the road respect its final intentions. Witch such fragile script and stylized characters where the emotional coordinates are blended with some here and there violent moments, the film does not achieve even a median stature.The presence of Wesley snipes was the only reason to watch it, but pitifully he was absolutely wasted in a secondary role.Too much noise and few walnuts."
2,Sweet Dreams,"Norwood was a sure cure for the insomnia I've been experiencing. The characters were forgettable except that I wanted to slap most of them before committing them to oblivion, and the content as flat as the tires should have been on the stolen cars. Had they been flat they would have gone nowhere, which is exactly where this book went for me."
5,Norwood,"Great book, I laughed and it made me long for the simpler time! Charles Portis is brilliant! I would highly recommend this book!"
3,avid reader,"What is the big deal about this book? Why all the glowing reviews? How can anyone compare it to A Confederacy of Dunces? Oh well...it wasn't unpleasant reading, I chuckled a few times, I didn't dislike the characters. It was well written, but incomplete. To me it was a novel that went nowhere. I would call it a mildly entertaining extended short story."
1,HATE IT!,"This book was extremely boring, some of the other reviews say "" THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING!!""it was'nt. It was boring and confusing, the 1 of the only fear street books i didnt like (the other was the cheater.)"
4,Solid analog radio with digital freq. and easy to use features,"This is great for combining the tweeky tuning and low noise of an analog tuner with digital frequency readout so you can tell where you are going. I use the clock-radio-alarm feature every day, and the settings are easy. The AM reception is good, not great, but really quiet, so I can use my Terk AM Advantage tuned loop for DX. The FM is good, not real sensitive, but very selective. Nice for a suburb. The shortwave is good on narrow, but weak sensitivity...It needs a 12 foot wire to reach out there. The drift is a bit irksome, but the tradeoffs are sensible for a $100 receiver. The battery set really lasts. The headphone comes out mono, although there is stereo phono output...that is very hi-fidelity when run into amps, etc. It could use help w/ reception, but it's solid, easy, and goes well w/added antennas and hand-tuning. A low-hassle radio with growth potential."
2,How does this thing work?,"This radio sounds great for AM and FM stations, but surprisingly, it has no presets. For the price that you pay, this is very disappointing. Also, I can't get a single station on the international bands. The manual is worthless. I gave it two stars because it looks good on my desk."
3,A lot of extra songs I didn't want,All the great hits I wanted are on here but also ones I wasn't familiar with and didn't like so now I have to skip thru to hear what I want. There are some early hits I didn't know he wrote. I grew up in the 60's so those are the songs I loved more than the 50's.
5,Can't go wrong with this one,Bought this to work with Kingston Mobilelite USB 2.0 9-IN-1 Reader and it works perfectly.
5,The only strap I'll ever use,"I was introduced to these straps through my bandmates and I won't use anything else from now on. They're certainly not the most comfortable, but they are SOOO reliable. I've used them on both my bass guitar and my regular old guitar. Never any problems as long as you use the right screws (which are all supplied). Basically, DiMarzio is the way to go."
5,"Words, not definitions","The use of the Stedman's word books, this being only one of many, is primarily for those in medical transcription and others (medical authors, editors, proofreaders, etc.) who need an authoritative source on correct spelling and terminology. This is the stated intent of these books, as is clearly spelled out in the foreword of all Stedman's books. This seems important for me to mention here, as at least one reviewer of this book seemed disappointed that there isn't more information.As a transcriptionist, I assure you that the several hundred pages of cross-referenced terms here are very, very useful in correct transcription of medical dictation. This section includes musculoskeletal terms and rehab terms, which are exactly its stated contents. As usual, Stedman's succeeds beautifully in providing an exhaustive collection of terms relating to the areas of interest presented in this book."
5,"I LOVE ""Plain American Girl!""","I really enjoyed your song ""Plain American Girl!"" I found a blogger, Heath Andrews, who review this song:""From its soft, piano based opening, you might not expect ""Plain American Girl"" to open up into an infectiously catchy rock song, but that's just what it does. The Stone Coyotes take their beautiful vocals and marry them to a powerful guitar riff that builds as the song goes along. By the time the song nears its end, the arrangement is into full swing, with the gentle currents of the opening still lingering beneath the crunch of the guitar and the smooth vocals."""
5,The Vernon Johns Story:The Road to Freedom,"Absolutely brilliant acting on the part of James Earl Jones.He really makes you feel you are right there and he was very convincing in his role as Vernon Johns,you would actually believe you are watching the man himself.The Vernon Johns Story: The Road to Freedom"
5,Unusually Powerful !!,"This is a movie that is a must for those who are brave enough to look into the eyes of a fearless man who walked in the spirit and power of a ""John the Baptist."" America only acknowledges Dr. M.L. King and Mrs. Rosa Parks, but they stood on the shoulders of Rev. Vernon Johns. He was the beginning of the ""revolution for righteousness."" He showed them how to take the reigns for control of their own lives. They listened. Excellently written script. A classic that should be required viewing in every junior high school. I only regret that neither Johns, nor King ever got to enjoy the respect, appreciation and acclaim they so very much deserved. This is a classic, fit for ANY home or age."
3,just okay,"Though I imagine this product could work well for some dogs, its not too affective for mine. My dog's bark doesn't register most of the time. I have a small (9 lb) dog with a higher pitched bark. Maybe that's why it doesn't register? However, I do know the product does startle the dog when it is activated. When possible, I depress the button on the device to emit the sound once the dog starts barking. Its evident that she hears it and is less likely to continue to bark."
2,Great Idea...but...,"This product is a great idea, if you have a large dog with a low bark. I have a toy Pomeranian and his bark is too high pitched to trigger it and the sensitivity isn't adjustable. Otherwise, it is a good idea and the button on top helps when training. Manually used its great...automatically, not so good."
3,PetSafe PBC-1000Indoor Bark Control,Works just fine on one dog; the other one does not react to it. The devise did what we wanted for the dog we wanted to control. The biggest inconvience was that there is no On-Off switch. I had to open it and wire in an On-Off switch.
2,should not be called bark deterrent; but start dog shaking,"I have two jack russell mix females(they are mother and daughter), they are quick to notify something is amiss...or that someone is here.Have attempted to use the deterrent several times within about 12-18 hours of connecting battery (yes, the lights on front blink red and green to indicate operation) the youngest and smallest of the two dogs will begin to tremble, incessantly, with no other apparent change in environment. It ""may"" calm the barkinkg ever so slightly. When the battery is removed and device seases to function, the trembling/shaking stops. If I try again the nexy day or so; the same scenario plays out and the shaking, etc. repeats until battery unplugged again. So obviously this device is of no real value to me and a waste of the almost twenty six dollars I paid for it. I guess I will have to try the almost fifty dollar device from Hammacher Schlemmer."
1,not worth it....,It does not give out a high enough frequency.. My dog just looks at it and continues to bark.. I did read the other reviews. But most for the people that did not like it had Terriers which I also owned and know they can be a tough dog to train. I have a Bichon so I thought it would work. No.
2,My dog must be deaf,This thing does not work on my Yorkshire Terrier. He still barks inside even with the unit just five feet from him. He doesn't seem distressed at all by it. Totally worthless for us.
1,This product is a waste of money!,It doesn't do as stated in the discription. It never even phased my small dog.She would look at it and continue to bark.
2,short term success,"I have used this and it worked ...............for about a month. After that the dogs just ignored it , even after battery replacements! Would not buy again."
3,Works okay but not great,"This device has no on/ off switch which is very inconvenient, only way to switch off is to take 9V battery outWill trigger when dogs bark quite accurately, but also triggers falsely when other noises are around, like loud talking, banging, etc, which is why we leave it off until we go outWe have noticed our dogs are better at not barking when we return from being out (the reason we bought it) but the problem isn't eliminated.Ryan"
3,Apparantly not strong enough for a min-pin,"I have 4 dogs. Seems to work in a small room but when the min-pin gets barking at a stranger in my home, it doesn't seem to affect him."
3,Mixed success,"A friend raved over the successes w/ the bark controller. I snicker to share that our 1 yr old ACTIVE parti-color cocker spaniel managed to find ways around the controller. If he's barking non-stop, the barker appears to deter the barking UNLESS he's trying to ""protect"" us from someone at the front door. It works and annoys him if he's barking to get what he wants (esp. if we depress the button). I cannot quite figure it out either. We actually purchased for those summer mornings where we'd all like to sleep past the conditioned 0630...the bark, pause, pause, pause, bark, pause, pause, etc. doesn't seem to elicit the controller response as successfully...that or our puppy dog ignores it. The Kirby vacuum cleaner, however, does cause the bark controller to engage, so I have to take the battery out or wonder how the barage of high-pitched sounds is torturing the dog."
1,PIECE OF JUNK-TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"This item does not work....plain and simple. I'm almost embarrassed that I spent the $30 and the cost of a 9v battery for such a useless item. My dog just continually barked through the automatic and hand pressed features. I also find it interesting that the red light goes off when the battery is out, not when the item is activated (that would be helpful for humans who can't hear it to know that it is actually working).If the product is marketed as something humans can't hear, then how would anyone really know if it was working or not.....if a tree falls in the woods but no one's around....."
2,doesn't activate automatically as advertised,Petsafe PBC-1000 Stationary Ultrasonic Bark ControllerPetsafe PBC-1000 Stationary Ultrasonic Bark ControllerThe unit does not go off when my dogs bark even if it is right in front of them. It does work well as a deterrent when I manually push the activation button.Maybe it doesn't acknowledge small dogs.Not recommended.
1,No effect at all,"I bought the PetSafe Ultrasonic Indoor Bark Control at PetSmart. It was totally worthless. I tried it for a month with no effect on the three dogs. I took it back and they refunded all my money, which is commendable. It may work on some dogs, but not on the ones at my house."
2,Didn't work on my Rat terrier,"I believe nothing will stop a Rat Terrier from barking... I really thought that this would work, My Boston Terrier has no need for it so I really can't say if it affects her or not.I'll keep it on for a while longer and see."
2,Probably works better for less dogs,"I am sure this product would work much better if fewer dogs were involved. I have 4 so it didn't have much impact on their barking. I sat it right by our front door on a table but, they didn't seem to notice or, at least not enough to stop barking."
2,2 Thumbs Down!,"My Little Yapper Can't Hear The Device Because She's Yapping So Loud!A waste of money. My ShiPoo is 4 years old, maybe if she was trained at an earlier age it would work."
1,Didn't work for us,"The first time the device went off, the dog cocked his head to the side and looked at me. Every subsequent time, he didn't seem to notice at all. Didn't have any effect on him at all."
1,Save your Money,Do not buy this product it is a waste of money. This will be the biggest mistake you ever make. I would recommend you buy anything but this item. Spend the extra money
3,Works good when it works,"When I first bought this product and put in the battery, I noticed an immediate change in my dogs barking behavior. She still barked a bit but not as much or as often. The battery died pretty quickly, as in a week or two. I replaced the battery and now when I hit the button, I can hear a garbled sound and it is not working when the dogs bark."
4,seems to help,"the band it does seem to help but it does not eliminate the paifrom tendinitis or tendonosis. I use it sometime sitting at my desk and it helps alleviate pain but problem still exists. it does help with my work outs but after the work out the tendonitis is really flared up.I can't say whether the magnets help or not.put it this way, its the best brace I have found for tennis elbow."
4,"""See You When The Sun Goes Down,""","...is what the host usually says before the end of each episode. Usually.While I didn't purchase this DVD, I still remember watching the show on Animal Planet. It was pretty good, and the fact that it took place AT NIGHT (gee, never woulda' guessed that), with neato night-vision gear made this fun and informative to watch, especially with its ""guess what creature made this sound"" intermissions, which I hope are on here. It can be suspenseful, but the fact that he ""finds"" whatever animal that was featured in the episode wasn't a big surprise. Maybe I'm just easily wowed, or maybe I've just written the worst review for this, but I would definitely consider buying this, at least for some animal 101 fun."
5,Best $12 I ever spent!!,"I read the reviews before I bought it, but still cannot believe it: How can you get a staple gun, staples AND a case for $12?? It came today, and I thought I'd be returning it. NEVER. This baby does the job. I bought it for one job, but now that I have it, I'm looking for more."
1,Doesn't work,I don't recommend this product for a very simple reason. It doesn't work. You can put the staples in the staple gun but it staples absolutely nothing.
3,Par Lindh does another dynamic album,"I like this album, but ""Brill"" is not as enjoyable for me as ""Fool's Journey"" was, probably because Roine Stolt (The Flower Kings, Transatlantic) is absent; not surprising given the 8 years between albums. The vocals are still average. And the album is pretty diverse from song to song, if not inconsistent, which might make the album a difficult listen from start to finish. If anything, this album really captures the late 1960s, early 1970s crossover from psychedelic pop rock to symphonic progressive rock. If you like that era of prog-rock, then this album should rehash what you're interested in. If you are a Par Lindh fan, then this album is highly recommended, not just to complete a collection, but because the sounds on this album are what you'd expect from Par."
4,A little bulky but works great,"I am an avid camper and this light did exactly what I wanted it to, gave me hands free lighting. The light clicks up and down giving it some adjustability. The light is also very bright and gives off a good wide source of light. The only complaint I have with this light is that it is a little bulky. If you are looking for something very small this light is not for you. It doesnt have any other modes except for on and off. Depending on what you are looking for that can be a pro or a con. If you just want a simple inexpensive bright headlamp this one is great."
2,Broken,"I read a previous review saying this item had arrived broken, but since there were lots of reviewers who apparently received it intact, I decided to go for it. Well, mine arrived broken, too. The packaging is inadequate for shipping--the pestle is very heavy, and the only thing separating it from the bowl was a piece of cardboard. Since another reviewer said their bowl broke during use, I now think the bowl is probably just too thin to handle this heavy, close-fitting pestle. I still think this style is ideal for my needs (crushing pills) but will try a different one."
3,Only for Small Pills,"I grind various size pills daily from 1/2 baby aspirin to large, hard caplets. I have used the standard heavy marbel mortar & pestle for 10+ years but it can hurt your hands with the large pills and the small pills get lost in the bottom. The base of my standard M&P is heavy to lift in order to brush out the powder. This was huge problem when I broke my wrist a few years back. So I ws looking for something smaller but effective to make the pill grinding easier. I read all the reviews & selected this M&P to grind the large pills hoping the size of the pestle would easily crush the pills. I can powder 8 large caplets at a time in my standard M&P. This M&P would not grind even one large pill effectively. It does however work well with small pills, so it has some use."
3,Good for absolute beginner of the subject but not for others,"This is probably a good beginer's source. Not for those who understand the concepts of JDBC and Java. The book, on the back cover, implies that this is for Advanced to Experiences users, but I do not think so. The examples in the book teach you the JDBC and how to create your own objects and interfaces around it. Too basic if you know Java and has been programming in it for a while.If you are a beginner do not hesitate to buy this book. The accompanied CD will be a great source for you to run through the examples and to start off with few sample projects of your own. The author had a good style in teaching the subject with well chosen examples and coverage of the concepts and explanation of those examples."
4,"Great Oil, Good For You","I've purchased a few different types of hempseed oil and hempseed products. The taste takes a little getting used to, but the benefits are wonderful. Think flaxseeds, but without the negative side effects--though the flavor is definitely much stronger. As far as the flavor: I have to say its a bit like melted unsalted high-quality butter (with that almost sweet quality) but also has a nutty taste that reminds me of fresh pine nuts (though a little more bitter and, well, maybe a touch skunky). The pungency reminds me of sesame oil too, even though it's not nearly that potent a smell/taste nor as deep a flavor.The problem with hempseed oil though is that it has a tendency to go rancid. I was a little worried ordering this online precisely because of that, but I was pleasantly surprised. My Amazon.com oil arrived promptly and tasted really fresh. It kept well in my fridge, and didn't go rancid for quite a while.I will definitely be buying this again!"
4,Nice product,The taste is mild and reminds me of sunflower seeds. Doesn't really work in smoothies because it is quick to seperate and the smell makes me gaggy. It would probably be best on a salad...
3,Okay product,"I bought this because Dr. Oz recommended hemp oil. It has a nutty taste and I like it. However, I don't like it for frying. It was recommended to use this instead of olive oil. After using this, I still prefer olive oil for frying, but with this nutty taste, it goes well on salads."
5,wonderful stuff,"I use this on my face as moisturizer. I have combination skin and a bit acne prone, but I haven't had a single zit since I started using it. It smells pretty bad and has to be kept refrigerated so I filled up a one ounce bottle I had floating around and added a couple drops of essential oil to make it a bit easier to use. I literally use about 5 drops for my entire face/neck.my mom bought this exact brand at sprouts in the 16 oz bottle and paid 18$ for it, so this is a great deal."
1,"Cap was busted, taste was awful","I ordered a bottle of this based on a recommendation, for its health benefits, and instructed to put it in my morning protein smoothie. The person who recommended it also swore I wouldn't be able to taste it in my smoothie. Unfortunately, they were wrong. It completely ruined the smoothie with it's funky, almost grassy/plant-like taste. I couldn't finish the smoothie and I don't think I'll even attempt to use it in anything else. To top it off, my bottle arrived with the cap busted. I won't be purchasing this again."
2,Not sure what to do with it!,"It definitely has an overpowering nutty flavor to it, but i'm really trying to figure out ways to ingest it so that I am not distracted by the smell. Any advice will be greatly appreciated."
2,Yawn.....another R/3 admin book,"How many more books with the same content can this market take? For some reason, I thought I needed this book to add to all the others in my collection, but after reading it I wish I had my money back. It's not *bad*, but it's got the same stuff as the R/3 Documentation CD and nothing really new or innovative to add. Let's all save our $, and perhaps eventually publishers will commission a book that tells us something we don't already know."
4,below par Slade thriller,"I am a big fan of Slade and find his books thrilling, informative and sometimes nightmarish. His style is to integrate into the story a lot of background on the places, people and events in the book. In earlier books this exposition has been balanced and did not distract from the plot. However ""Burnt Bones"" was more exposition than plot. The story could have been very frightning but the jumps from storyline to historical facts was not well planned and diminished the enjoyment of the story. I like Slade's style and most of the factual material is quite interesting, but when it completely overshadows the story it is annoying. I still am a fan and have his two latest books to read this summer. I hope more emphasis is placed on telling the scary stories he is famous for in these two."
1,Hated It,Ugh......there is nothing more irritating than an author who tries to use every adjective or metaphor known to man. I couldn't finish this book. I was so bored with the over descriptive story telling. Not worth my time.
1,Way off the pace,"Having read all the Slade books I found this book quite slow. Being somewhat intersted in history the background was more interesting than the cardboard characters and plot of the book. Hopefully, Hangman goes back to Headhunter form rather than this disappointment."
2,A Far Cry From Good,"Judging by the description written on the back of the book, I assumed that Michael Slade's Burnt Bones would be a great read. I was right at first until he started getting into a whole bunch of history mumbo-jumbo. It seems as if he wrote this book, not for the story, but so he could brag about how well he knows his history.Slade some how finds every way possible to fit in little tidbits of useless historic information. Through dialogue and just plain old writting, he ruins what could have become an excellent plot for an excellent story.Next time I look for a Michael Slade Novel, if there is a next time I look for one of his books, I will be sure to skimm through the majority of the pages - but is it even worth all my time?"
3,Just not the same,"I have read all of the Michael Slade books and couldn't wait for this one to come out. Unfortunately, it wasn't really worth the wait. I often wondered how multiple authors could get together and write a book. In this case I think it really shows that something is missing from the others input. The suspense in the earlier works kept me wishing those books would never end. Burnt Bones never really captured my interest. It was OK but not what I've come to expect from Michael Slade. Hopefully, if there are more to come the original authors will get together again."
3,not quite what I expected,"When these arrived they were smaller than I thought they would be and much more sloping towards the bottom. The photo gives the impression that they are almost straight sided, which is what I wanted, but they are not. I was going to use them to make pork pies, but will look for something else. I am sure I can use them for muffins.An update: having read some of the other reviews I wnder now if I have been sent the wrong product. They certainly do not look like the picture i.e. much more sloping. As I live in England I can't be bothered to send them back, but the photo is misleading."
4,Cute!,"I thought the muffin cups would be bigger, these are quite small, so was a little dissapointed, not regular size, like for cupcakes, actually smaller...if your going for ""small"" and ""cute"", this will workl."
1,Smells Disgusting and doesn't work well,"This product REEKS. I can't even use it, thats how bad and how strongly it smells. I made it through one clean, but won't be using it again - what a waste. It also doesn't clean that well, and my cooktop was NOT that dirty. The cleaner that came with the oven, the Sears brand, works much much better. Should have made the trip to Sears instead of trying this brand instead."
3,Works great for day-to-day,"If you are just looking for a product to clean your ceramic stovetop on a daily or bi daily basis, then this is your product. However, if you really need a great cleanser, this one won't do the job. I had no idea how to take care of a ceramic cooktop and thus mine looks horrendous. The gal below, Jackie, has the only solution I've found that works on that type of hideous stain. The Mr. Clean eraser, bar keepers friend cleanser, with a Windex chaser really does an amazing job. This product is great for a light problem, but if you're really looking for something to deep clean, then try the Mr. Clean/Cleanser option."
4,cerama bryte,cleaned and polished well will purchase it again when needed. the price on this was very good. if you own a ceramic glass top I would recommend this stuff.
4,Alfred's Group Piano,"The book overall is okay..the cd that comes along with it, for a very beginner goes along a little fast. Other than that the book is good for beginners and helps you to advance."
5,Hard Stuff,"I was in a heavy metal band ""CIrith Ungol"" for 22 years and these guys were one of my favorite bands and influences. I would highly reccommend this for any fan of heavy metal or hard rock."
1,setting up lamp,"At the moment, don't buy this book. The reason: what is otherwise an excellent book cannot be followed, because the essential steps it takes you through require resources that are not available - ie. the web resources no longer exist. Time is money, and after spending another long day yesterday, running into one dead end after another, one failed work around after another, this book has cost me lots, and I've not achieved anywhere near Setting Up Lamp. The authors/publisher could correct this easily enough, by providing the info on their website. If these issues are corrected, the book is likely to rate differently. Until that time, invest elsewhere."
2,Not what was expected.,I am very unsatisfied with this book. It only gives instructions on how to setup a lamp using one distro only. And it was geared only to well experienced users. The book was incomprehensible to me.
5,The Small Business Valuation Book,"Recommended highly, but for persons with a strong background in Accounting, Business and Finance. Not for the beginner. A Harvard Education helps.."
2,"AM/FM is OK, SW just isn't there...","I understand that you shouldn't expect a lot from the radio that lists under $15 but I believe that manufacturer should deliver on the basic functionality. None of the short wave bands works, all you get is a lot of static and some distorted FM transmissions (yes, on SW band). Also, I've noticed that the the frequency bands don't follow standard convention, which could make some of them pretty useless (if they were working).I own several portable AM/FM/SW radios and, although some of them have better SW reception than others, I've never had an item that claims SW coverage but has none.On the positive note, AM/FM seems to be OK."
1,Coby radios are BAD,"This is the second basic Coby AM/FM radio I purchased from Amazon.com, and both models were total junk. I returned one, but I had already discarded all packaging from this one, so I feel too guilty to return this one, too. I highly recommend you never buy a Coby product, and Amazon.com should stop selling this junk. Coby appears incapable of building a functioning radio."
3,Not Bonfire Madigan,Please note that the attributed artist is incorrect.This is the metal group 'Bonfire' and not the punk cello stylings of Bonfire Madigan.
2,"Awesome movie, poor quality","This is one of my favorite Japanese movies of all time! It's like Inuyasha, but instead of searching for crystal shards, they're searching for body parts! Satoshi Tsumabuki is also easy on eyes!But while the movie is great, I was very disappointed by the picture quality. It's very pixelated in some parts. I almost feel that I could get a better quality elsewhere."
5,Amazing,"This album is, as the other review says, truly haunting and beautiful. Most of the time, I have to play a new album for awhile to really love it. From the first play, Treble and Tremble grabbed me and I've not taken it out of my cd player since. If you're a fan of Elliott Smith and the like, I highly recommend picking this up!"
3,Not so crazy about this one!,"I purchased this game for the PS2 for my son who is 4 and I find it rather boring. The only thing he even likes to do is the coloring and even then there are only like 2 or 3 pictures to choose from. It seems to go slow and take forever to do anything. You have to listen to all the characters talk and you cant just get right to the game. After reading some other reviews though it seems to have worked for many, but neither myself or my son were too impressed with this one!"
5,Perfect transaction,I ordered from a diff vendor at first they sent me a cd that skipped not cool...I did recieve a refund and searched a bother vendor with a good rating ....fast shipping cd is perfect extremely happy with this thanks
4,good vibes,"this is a good product and nearly as good as the wired Magic Wand, but not as intense as the Acuvibe, but battery last longer. Acuvibe used to hold charge for a month of orgasms, but now holds only for maybe two days."
3,Not bad ...,"This is the only canoe technique DVD I could find. It is satisfactory, but not great at demonstrating strokes. You could save money viewing canoe strokes on YouTube. Some demonstrations are rushed and you must replay repeatedly to comprehend details. This DVD has several negatives: starts with commercials and advertisements you're unable to skip over, irrelevant skits meant to entertain (?), overly basic admonitions like apply sunscreen to bare skin, and annoying bad music. The music in the beginning is especially loud, so you turn down the volume but can't hear the narrators' voices later on."
3,The last truly listenable Caravan album,"After the horrid CUNNING STUNTS, David Sinclair wandered off to write increasingly vanilla soundtrack music, and, with Mike Wedgwood thankfully pushed into the background where he belonged, Pye Hastings (at least temporarily) found his muse once again and produced some half-decent tunes. I'm not much of a fan of (keyboardist) Jan Schelhaas, but after Sinclair and Wedgwood ruined CUNNING STUNTS, Schelhaas (again, temporarily) pumped some much-needed blood into this band, resulting in something of a weaker version of the GIRLS WHO GROW PLUMP album. Producer David Hitchcock left after this one, Jan Schelhaas's synthesizers subsequently took on a grating, irritating quality (listen to BETTER BY FAR...barf!) and that was really the end of Caravan. Overall this one's quite listenable, but certainly not essential Caravan."
5,Not just for the beginner,A great book. Between the battle narratives and wonderful pictures are sandwiched many discussions of people and things like railroads. And let's get off the revisionist theories that the war was not primarily about slavery. I've gone to many symposiums and field trips with the likes of Edwin Bearss etc and still gained a better understanding of the war by reading this book.
5,Great and easy read,"This book stands out because it is one the most readable books you will find in the history section. It is very clear and you do get a lot of information about the time that representatives from all the states were in Philadelphia during a hot summer to write the Constitution.If you are a highschool student it is therefore very interesting because it gives you a good insight in how this remarkable document came into being. For more advanced readers it is also very interesting, it is especially better than any other book on this subject, it makes the whole process clearer than in a standard history book. It also gives a great explenation of the men who were involved. Through looking at the private documents of the participants she makes the process more human, and therefore more easily understandable."
4,Impressions about the CD,"Some songs are super but some of them are not. Even though some songs are ""old-fashioned"" I liked that. It's inevitable that some of the compositions are less dynamic than leading ones, which is why you could skip some songs."
2,"Nice solid top, but that's about it...","First the good:This table has a nice solid top with a full sized miter slot.The bad:Having said that, the fit and finish are very poor. The leg mechanism is held to the table with lag bolts, which is no problem. However, these were placed incorrectly and the bolts went in at an angle of approximately 25 degrees which IS a problem. rather than correct the problem, whoever assembled the leg set just bent parts to make them fit. this is almost criminal because the leg set is very solid and stable.And of course, The ugly:The fence is very heavy, which is a good thing. unfortunately, whoever assembled the thing must have been related to whoever applied the finish to the fence. It's the ugliest paint job I have ever seen, well since that time saw a car that had been painted with housepaint and a brush!The end result is that I built a cabinet and a fence for the top. So I ended up with a decent setup after all, but should I have had to?"
2,Cowboy Nostalgia,"I had been hearing about Thomas McGuane for what felt like decades. Finally, a few days ago, I got the chance to read one of his books. The female characters were compelling, but the male characters were caricatures, which surprised me. There were only three types: the stoic, laconic ""heroic"" cowboy; the small-time hood; and the put-upon husband. The long passages displaying the author's familiarity with cowboy lore were VERY lazy writing-- and dull, dull, dull. There was some attempt at elegy..."
5,"Great Music, Great Value . . .","I recently discovered Bob Schneider on Austin City Limits, and I couldn't wait to hear more. I can see myself adding all his albums to my collection, but thought this was a good place to start; I wasn't disappointed."
2,Not really for all of us,"Perhaps it's me, but it wasn't what I hope.Sure, the book have its points, and in a way explain the basis for the neofit... but, I don't know, I really expected something diferent than a semi-tantric introduction to the Art of Orgasm.Anyway, as a reference... bad choice. For peak into other point of view about sex could be interesting."
1,Dazed and Confused,"After trying to read this book I started to wonder how Arthur Laffer agreed to co-author this. Who told Mr. Odishelitze that he was an authority on the subject? What university did he attend? This evidently a poorly written hatchet job by a disgruntled individual with axes to grind and prejudiced against the people of Puerto Rico. When reading about a specialized subject, as a reader I want to know that the writer has a notion of what he or she is talking about, and about their credentials. Mr. Odishelitze lacks objectivity, apparently does not have the academic crdentials and his book is simply a non starter. I would definitely not want anyone to spend money on it. Anyone care to buy my copy?"
5,a pleasant computer introduction to little ones,"I bought this program for my first grandson when he was 3. He loved it. It's simple and boring for grown ups , but at that age he was so proud to be on the computer., and he learned.,not only from the program.,but also how to work the computer. Now he is 6 years.,and he has playstation,nitendo,and wii.,he loves it all. He has programs for art and coloring,painting.,and very smart. I lost this program,it kept going from his house to mine and back again. Now I'm ordering it for his 2 1/2 year old brother and then to his new baby brother coming in July, plus it will be used by my grandaughter who is 3. Its a good program for little ones."
3,"Correct conclusion, suspect analysis","Matthew covers an important premis - Saudi oil reserves are lower than we think. He may be, and probably is spot on the mark with this conclusion. However he has based his conclusion from reading 200 SPE papers on Saudi production. Whilst other sources of information are admittedly hard to come by, SPE papers are not an unbiased source of information. Invariably they set out to demonstrate a technical problem and how ingenious the authors were at solving these problems. So to conclude that Saudi production is beset by technical problems because there are so many papers written on the subject is invalid. Dull, incesant, problem free production does not make a good technical paper! That said, the conclusions on why reserves are pushed up for political means is spot on (in my experience) and his overall conclusions are probably quite valid - and important."
3,This book is a great effort to make the general public aware of the influence of Saudi oil on global growth; however misleading.,"I found this book to be great as an basic introduction to the world of Saudi oil supply. Matthew Simmons does a great job at conveying the problems that Saudi Arabia MAY currently have with sustainable oil production. However, I found his book to be very repetative and single-sided. Simmons, a financial analyst, understands the basics of reserves estimation, but the finer details of oil recovery elude him. In addition, Simmons does not consider the vast supplies of oil sands in Canada (proven oil reserve second only to Saudi Arabia) when he suggests future sources of oil supply. As a petroelum geologist, I appreciate Simmons' attempt to build the Saudi reserve picture from the bricks of the SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) archives; although he is extremely narrow-minded in his approach."
3,And yet...,"Interesting book but I will not comment on it as many have done so better than I could. However, I offer you the following:Here is a PDF overview of the book:http://www.cera.com/news/details/1,2318,7453,00.htmlSome related reportsOil & Liquids Capacity to Outstrip Demand Until At Least 2010http://www.cera.com/news/details/1,2318,7453,00.htmlAsian Oil Demand is Rapidly Declining (July 14/2005 report):http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20050714-thu.html#anchor2Still does not hurt to recycle and buy efficient vehicles..."
1,Disappointed,"I was so looking forward to this book hoping to get a true insight of the oil industry, but unfortunately just came away disappointed.All I got from Mr. Simmons is that:The Saudis are liars...the Saudis rely on 5 or 6 fields for all their oil...the Saudis can produce this oil at obscene low prices...The Saudis will run out of oil...So what Mr. Simmons!! Isn't that the primary reason other production hasn't come on line?How many thousands of oil wells have been shut down because they couldn't hope to profit with oil at $1.00, $2.00, $10.00, $20.00 or even $30.00 a barrel with all this cheaper oil on line?How many thousands of these oil wells will come back on line with $60.00 barrel oil? How much oil can be produced from oil sands at $60.00? How about oil shale? No where does Mr. Simmons address these issues, why??It seems that Mr. Simmons has sold out to the end of the world crowd."
3,"too long, too little","Matthew Simmons is a big name in the industry. It is therefore not surprising that his book receives a lot of attention. Is that justified based on the contents alone?The major point that Mr. Simmons makes is that reserves in Saudi Arabia are not as high as generally thought. Based on data presented in the book this may well be the case. However, the data that is presented does not justify more than 400 pages. There is an awful lot of duplication. I imagine that the book could have been written in 100 pages as well.Mr. Simmons states that the Saudi oil fields are 'mismanaged' causing a reduction in ultimate recovery. People in the industry know that there can be many reasons why maximum ultimate recovery is not the primary goal when developing a field. Some smaller issues: Mr. Simmons is not primarily a technical man and acknowledges that. There are therefore some minor mistakes related to technical issues.Overall the book is useful, but too long."
3,Saudi fields are maturing,"This book is very repetitive and too long, but it does contains a lot of useful information about oil fields and the complex business of getting the oil out. From the facts laid out in this book there is little doubt that Saudi oil fields are maturing with years of dependence on massive water injection and in recent years horizontal drilling to maintain high production rates. The production curves included in the book for eight large fields oil fields outside Saudi Arabia, including Prudhoe Bay Alaska, are sobering. Clearly there is some risk that in the not too distant future Saudi oil production will begin to decline."
1,Fails the test of time,"According to this book, the US should have experienced widespread natural gas shortages years ago.Instead, we have a glut of natural gas. Natural gas is cheaper here than anywhere else in the world.What else do you need to know? This book is full of predictions. Almost none of them have withstood the test of time. The natural gas shortage-to-glut is the most prominent of these, but not the only one."
3,$14.99 is cheaper but nicer than the cactus pan,These fishes are so cute. Why are the cactii more expensive?
1,filters are not compatible,"I purchased the Toddy replacement filters (2-pack) but discovered they do not fit the Filtron cold brew system. They are much too small so no way fit the Filtron system. I tried hydrating one to see if it would swell up to fit, but it does not. They are advertised on the Amazon site to go with the Filtron cold brew system (i.e., if you buy the Filtron cold brew + the extra Toddy stoppers + the extra Toddy 2-pack filters, you get a discount). Plus, by the way, the Toddy filters do not have a little pull tab for easier removal like the original Filtron filter has. Buyer beware."
3,Northern Industrial Cobalt Drills,I expected more from these drills as I was trying to remove exhaust manifold bolts from my truck but the drills wouldn't cut into the bolts that were heat hardened from many of driving. I will use these drills in other applications but they wouldn't work for the application for which purchased.
1,Lousy and illiterate,"This is one of the worst technical books that I have ever seen. Clearly the 5-star ratings are from the authors friends and cronies. This book has sparse examples, many typographical errors, and is a generally jumbled mess of English prose. If I had not opened the CD then I would return it.Don't make the same mistake that I did."
1,Eh... 3.0???,"Once again, IDG has used a misleading title to sell a book. There is nothing in this about the new CORBA draft standard. There oughta be a law!"
5,Middle Eastern Mystique,"Deep urban Arabic & Indian tabla grooves combining haunting & evocative vocalisations, swirling & floating in & around native instruments coupled with modern dj scratches. A must for lovers of Middle Eastern music, with a modern feel...."
4,Talvin's Best So Far,"This album is stunning. I think Singh does the best job in this album of truly fusing DJ\techno beats with Indian (or perhaps Eastern) rhythms and melodies. Tracks 4 and 5 are truly phenomenal (and addictive, so proceed with caution). While there are some tracks that are repetitive or that lack punch, I'd say the majority of the album is well worth the expense. To be even more extreme - track 5 alone is worth the album price in my view! Fantastic job, Singh! You are improving with age, as many things of value do. Can't wait to hear what you come up with next."
2,Handle too short,"This item is too small and flimsy. At least it doesn't bend like the plastic ones when trying to get clumps off the wall of the litter box, but your hand will touch litter at times during use."
2,Sangean Clock radio speaker,"This is a good product, but not for the money. For what it cost me to buy the clock radio plus this extra speaker, the device should have had a much better speaker with more low frequency output. It is not truly high fidelity as advertised if the lower freqs are chopped off. Tinny sound."
3,Game,Bought this for my parents. They play it. Both seem to like it. Its good for people who like to play cards but aren't always able to get to a game away from home.
1,Never Good Enough,"Face it. Unless you can't deal, there isn't a game out there that simulates cards good enough. It is always the same old same old. Are they cheating against me? Why isn't there all kinds of hi score and records files? Why are the ever-changing rules so concretely decided with no options in games like Hearts? And what is the deal with attempting to throw in graphics that just end up ruining the game? Duh: deal real."
4,A Beautiful Doll,"Legends of Ireland-The Bard is a beautiful doll for any collector, especially someone interested in Celtic legends and history. Mattel has become really good with hair color in their Barbie dolls, and the reddish-blonde highlights are beautiful. Her features are lovely and costume exquisite. I agree the eye-makeup could have been a little softer, but the overall effect is stunning, and I am proud to have her in my collection."
3,cute but...,"These shoes are most certainly cute as hell, however the fur has gotten nappy really quickly. I will continue to wear them, but I think that I spent too much for what I got."
5,How do you spell GENIUS!!!!!,Great music...incredible lyrics....fantastic show!!!! The Tony should have been taken home by William Finn!!!!! He is awfully good!
4,"Don't let the title of this book throw you, it's great!","I, never having heard of Gordon Dickson, saw this title when it came out and thought that it was another knock-off of Isaac Asimov's classic Foundation series so didn't read it until much later. What a surprise! A great novel that introduces several different thoughts and ways of thinking and a lead character that truly symbolizes something that we can all become! What's more it introduced the Dorsai! series to me and what a great rollicking military adventure that is! Read this and enjoy!"
4,Continuing the Childe Cycle,"Mankind has splinter in many cultures. Hal Mayne is raised by three tutors, each from a different culture. His goal is the reunification of mankind. This is an excellent novel about mankind future."
5,FANTASTIC,"Other than DUNE, this is the best science-fiction (IMO) book ever written. This will capture any sci-fi lover into Dickson's Childe cycle epic. A must read."
2,Problems with the graphics,I bought this to support my grandson in his typing skills. I'm sure it would have been a great tool for him but the graphics are too sophisticated for any of our computers (and they're not that old). I recommend you carefully look at the graphics required before purchasing this item.
4,Yes he can be taught,"I bought this for my granddaughter, age 7. She wasn't particularly interested. She apparently has no interest in typing and the game didn't intrigue her. I was disappointed. I was hoping it would help her with things like punctuation and capitalization. However, my 45 year old son in law is now using it to learn to type. Apparently, it's a good teaching tool if one wants to learn. Maybe when my granddaughter gets a little older..."
1,Unhappy,I have had a terrible time getting this program to run. It constantly shuts down or comes up with errors. It was a total waste of money as far as I am concerned.
1,Less expensive and larger at Crate and Barrel,"I was just about to buy this marble board, but was worried about the reviews on how it came packaged. I decided to quickly check a few other stores to see if they sold a similar item. I found a larger board at Crate and Barrel for a few dollars cheaper and you also don't have to pay the $10 shipping charge. I'm on my way there now to pick it up!"
5,Just in time,"After a head on collision two years ago, I doubted my ability to recover and whether I would ever walk again. Reading ""Right Risk"" provided me with the impetus to move forward by taking many risks from finally driving a car again to returning to work at a time when jobs are hard to come by.Right Risk has helped me focus on what's important in my life from my family to friends and making contact with relatives that I haven't seen in many years. I can relate to the nine limiting scripts as I have experienced most of them. It's good to know that I am not alone.Right Risk is a well written book, and I encourage everyone to read it, as we are all exposed to some sort of risk each and every day of our lives, and we need to know how to overcome our fear of risk. Accolades to Bill Treasurer."
4,All RIsks are Right Risks,"The author, Bill Treasurer, teaches the value of taking risks. Rather than stagnate or remain disenchanted with your life or circumstances, you learn how to take the right risk. Before my brother's, Frank, death he read a copy of this book which helped him clarify some of his impending decisions. I am so glad that he chose to ""take the leap"" and live the remaining days of his life truly happy.Embedded in every situation is a risk, only you can choose what is right. Make the right choice and live. Thank you Bill."
1,Time and Money Wasted,"This is a book full of Windows general usage information that targets novice Windows user, very little XP specific, and most of information you better read them from other alternative such as Windows Help which comes for free. It's poorly organized with redundancy and very little insights either technical or historical in the actual contents..."
3,"Good Read, Though Minor Silverberg","Most of the reviews here pretty much describe this book's impact. It's exceedingly well-written, very well paced, and richly envisioned. It's also a bit underachieved for the Silverberg most of us know and love whose masterpieces of SF in the Sixties and Seventies still resonate in out minds.On the other hand, as a stand-alone novel (and boy do we need more of these), this book is a very pleasant read and for readers new to Silverberg, THE LONGEST WAY HOME is a good place to start. (I gave this book only three stars because I know that Silverberg can do much better.)"
3,Agreeable,"A lovely story, a bit on the light side. After Majipoor's Shapeshifters, RS offers us a Mindswapper. A book perfectly mastered but rather conventional. That story does look like a prelude, the beginning of an epic. When I finished it I did wonder how the trials Joseph had endured would affect his ruling his estate... And possibly Homeworld ultimately. Indeed, the very best is yet to come. Setting is ready for Joseph to stage drastic changes in Homeworld. Will RS ever create them?"
4,Very readable,"I just finished this book, and really liked it. No, it's not as interesting as the ""Lord Valentine"" book I read a few months ago, but it's still very well written. Silverberg is a great writer - he really made me feel for the main character. His near starvation, loneliness, and sexual and political awakening are beautifully handled.Is it the best book he ever wrote? No. But it definitely is worth a read. Very enjoyable."
4,Digging the New Davis Sound,"The album was initially released in a 10-inch format in 1951 - with Dig, It's Only a Paper Moon, Denial, Bluing, Out of the Blue - and then issued in 1956 as a 12-inch ""album"" with the addition of My Old Flame and Conception.Miles has walked away from ""cool jazz"" and is exploring new avenues of sound with saxophonists Jackie McLean and Sonny Rollins, pianist Walter Bishop, Jr., drummer Art Blakey and Charles Mingus and Tommy Potter on contrabass.The soundscapes are works in progress - with McLean delivering the goods - and are an interesting chronicle of Miles expanding his artistry when he could have easily remained on familiar terrain."
4,GOOOOD sound for the money,I have learned the hard way.!! The cd player on my 3 year old PROTON unit was no functioning and decided to buy a SONY 500 series so-called compatible unit. I installed it quickly found out that the PROTON sounded FAAAAR better. So I returned the SONY500's unit and decided to clean the Proton's CD player... it was worth the effort after what I found out from the competing products. After a good cleaning it now works now JUST FINE. I would recommend this unit... It has 5 watts of audio power.... FAR more than all the others of compatible value
5,coleman generator,I had a very positive experience with this purchase. Delivery was on time and item received was as advertised. I would use this supplier again.
3,Does not contain even number solutions,"This book will only help you 50% of the time, because it only contains the odd numbered solutions, and if you consider the fact that the odd numbered solutions are already in the back of the book, it only becomes 25% useful because it shows you how those answers were found.Overall, Im disappointed"
2,Gets worse and worse as you read on,"The books starts off alright, but in the second part on multivariable calculus he just starts stating things without any proof or justification and it becomes very much like plugging numbers into formulas. Not good for a maths major."
5,Fabulous for the beginner,I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter to go with her new sewing machine for Christmas. In looking through it I am so very please. I have been sewing for 30+ years and I am very impressed with the safety details and exercises not only for using a sewing machine but for using an iron and cutting out patterns. There are lots of practice exercises so the child can become familiar with using the machine before she ever begins working on fabric. I am sure it is too much of a beginner book for someone with sewing experience but it is perfect for the child who has never sewn and the mother who has little or no experience with a sewing machine. My granddaughter and her mother are going to love this book.
4,Summer Sewing Fun,"I purchased this book to work with a beginner. It turned out to be fantastic! The beginning exercises were great to introduce the machine and work on basic sewing maneuvering. The projects were great for the novice, assisted by a seasoned seamstress. Great vacation projects!"
5,Perfect! Great Sale!,Great tools to help your child (or yourself) get used to using a sewing machine.
1,grrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!,"I say I hate it BECAUSE when I opened this it wasn't wrapped all that well basically was thrown into a box and shipped (disappointing) It was a -40 degree windchill and this had a cardboard box as its only protection. Then when I flip it open ....I get NOTHING! I should of had a some juice in it to power on, but I didn't so Ok so I set it aside for a few hours to let it warm up, not it! Then I checked all the outlets nope they were good and then I went made sure the battery was put in snug and the plugs all worked but I still had nothing!!! OMG at this point I am furious so I took it in to a computer guy and he told me that the place you plug the power cord into on the machine was the issue WTF? So NO I am not happy with this machine and I KNOW NOW I WILL NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN! such a hassel to have to send back and everything for something that is not worth it."
3,so so book,The book was to generic for me i was looking for morte detailed information. Like were to postion lights and subject to get this effect and so on. It had so good do's and dont's but for the price I wish I would have just check it out at the library.
1,Innapropriate,"This should not be available. i mean ""gale of darkness""? do you want the children of today to be hypnatized with all the is evil? i mean it is just wrong to letting kids see this much darkeness. kids like me need to be experiences good stuff like ponies, bunnies, and cats, the light of the world, good stuuf NOT EVIL!!! PLEASE LISTEN TO MY ADVICE SO YOU DO NOT HELP RAISE A BAD INFLUENCE!!!!!!!!!!!! and yes i am 11 yrs old..... if you want anymore bold ideas from we just e-mail me at [...] please. you are setting a bad influence umong kids."
4,The Colosseum Upgrade,"Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness is almost identical to Pokemon Colosseum, except for several changes were made to make the game much more interesting and fun to play. For example, the graphics are improved, battling has been slightly altered, and you have a new character to start out the game with. As with any game, this game has its pros and cons.Pros:- A wider choice of Pokemon to use throughout the game- Straightforward storyline- The problem-solving and puzzle parts of the game are not too difficult to figure out- Much better graphics- Easy controlsCons:- Battling can become monotonous- Not too much depth to the storyline- Not a whole lot to do after the game is beaten- Not much appeal for replayabilityIn all, the game is good, but there are a few minor and occasionally irritating drawbacks that affect gameplay. However, depending on how big a fan you are of the Pokemon franchise, these drawbacks can be overlooked."
3,great,"a few minor scratches, runs just fine, lags a little when you save the game, and sometimes freezes for a few seconds, and one crash every 10 times you play, but other than that its pretty good."
4,My Grandsons Love this Game!,"My eight year old grandsons love playing this Pokemon game. They are finding that it has much to learn in it and find that the Game Guide is very helpful. They love the FireRed, EmeraldGreen, LeafGreen, Sapphire, etc still so much, but they play this one on the GameCube all the time when they get together.Very glad I purchased it for both."
3,Pokemon XD,"This game is okay but I really dont get it. I mean it seems like its continued from another game.I got confused!I really,REALLY dont understand.I mean they-- act like like you should know all these new people!I was sort of glad my mom said to stop for a while.But I started to learn the people and it got fun.Though, you might want to rent it before you buy it--just in case your brain cant handle more!"
2,Le Carre with an axe to grind,"I have most of Le Carre's books and always look forward to a new one coming out. This one was characteristically very interesting in the back story and as always a fantastic character study. But all the good was quickly, dramatically erased with the book's horrible ending. It was amazingly poorly thought out and completely unbelievable - an incredible ""thud"" after a great character study. Le Carre is usually so nuanced looking at the world and this ending had such a ""these guys bad, these guys good and taken advantage of"" spin, it just feels like Le Carre's emotion got the best of him. Too bad."
3,Over the Top,"What could have been one of his good novels was overpowered by this anti-American political screed. Those of us who follow Le Carre know his opinion of the US and the UK relative to the war in Iraq. He could have let us know about that in a preface or even a non-fiction work, yet he chose to beat us over the head repeatedly with his views and spoiled what could have been a good work. The ""bad guys"" are more a product of advanced paranoia than even a remote reality. Still, he's a helluva writer."
1,"Dude, where's my Le Carré?","What oh what has happened to my favourite author, the creator of such Cold War literary gems as ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and ""The Russia House""? Instead of the wonderfully complex humanist George Smiley, in ""Absolute Friends"" we are now presented with one-dimensional characters such as the hapless Ted Mundy and cartoon villain Jay Rourke. Rather than the tightly-woven plots of his earlier books, we now have rambling storylines that barely mesh. And in place of the morally ambiguous universe that made his earlier novels so compelling, we are now given the didactic dreck and leftist political clichés of Le Carré's newly-acquired weltanschauung. A deeply disappointing book."
1,This One an Absolute Bust,"This book is nothing but his personal political statements of ""anti-Bush"" and ""anti-Blair"". After about 30 pages of boredom and insult to my intelligence, I quit and pitched the darned book."
2,sensitive American's enter at your own risk,"This book's sole purpose appears to be a venue for Mr LeCarre to vent his anti-American anti-Bush and Blair feelings. In doing so, he creates the dynamic duo of Teddy and Sasha, lovable and sympathetic characters, but in today's real world they would probably be considered ""losers"". Their ideology is certainly no more noble than that which LeCarre finds so contemptuous in the Bush administration. And the ending was unbelievable - at best. Shame on Mr LeCarre for wasting his great talents and imposing his personal views on loyal fans. This reader would have loved a few hours respite from a subject so well-worn."
1,Absolutely hypocritical,"Le Carre has lost his way in a book that is more a political statement than an espionage novel.His sympathetically idealistic character Sasha, described on the book's jacket as ""seeker after absolutes"" labels Israel's creation a ""monstrous human crime"" but doesn't want to be called anti-semitic.. He lambasts the Colation of the Willing's bombing of innocent Iraqis buts says nothing of Sadam's torcher and executions of hundreds of thousands of his own people.The author is clearly trying to make a statement but in so doing destroys what could have been one of his better books. The nuance and artfullnes of his previous books is replaced with the author's own obvious disdain for America, Israel and the war.The reader should be cautioned. If you cherished the Smiley trilogy, The Perfect Spy, The Little Drummer Girl and his other works as I did, do yourself a favor and don't read this book. You may become as disillusioned with the author is as the author is with us."
1,When bad things happen to good books,"I was deeply disappointed in LeCarre's latest offering. I'm not bothered by the anti-Americanism that other negative reviewers note, though it is indeed there and center-front.What struck me was that here was most of a very well-written novel that LeCarre seems to have gotten tired of after, oh say, page 400. At that point all of the naunced and thoughtful character development and observation gets heaved for a fantastic comic book finish done in large black and white strokes. The ""Heidelberg Seige"" as I believe its called in the book, is more the stuff of Tom Clancy than John LeCarre.In the end even LeCarre's sense for people fails him and the last few pages are simply an accounting lacking in skill and subtleness that only serve to further beat his political drum."
1,Whats it about?,"I almost put the book down after a 100 pages as I couldn't figure out what it was about or where it was going. The ending was equally bad, the book just goes no where besides talking about anti establishment type themes. Horrible."
2,"Not his best, certainly his worst ending","Having read all of LeCarre's previous books, I expected fantastic writing with a bit of a downer ending. Well this one had only mediocre writing and his worst ending ever! I really was disappointed. His writing still outshines most, but pales in comparison to that of his previous books. And the ending? I don't mind if it's a bit depressing, but this one was downright obscene. In the last chapter he stops writing and starts preaching, and the sermon is bad for any Americans--we're arrogant imperialists who faked the war in Iraq for oil and power, and worse than that, we're at fault for our response to terrorism. Seeing as how that was written by a man whose country didn't lose thousands of citizens on 9/11, I'm afraid I take offense. My recommendation: Wait for us his next book, probably he'll do better."
2,This Book Should be Left Out in the Cold,"David Cornwell, a/k/a John Le Carre' certainly has enough hits under his belt. He's made his literary bones big time. Why then, this recycling of cold war weltschmerz with an editorial and slap dash cartoon ending? Those of us who participated in the cold war in intelligence will wax reminiscent in the Sasha Mundy relationship, but Hell, it's been done to death already Mr. Le Carre'. You don't like American politics? Fine, but put your essays where they belong. And that ""Gee, I'm sick of my own book, so I'll kill everybody quick,"" ending? Your readership deserves better, and no doubt you can do better.Sometimes it pays to know when to throw in the typewriter and hit the showers. Maybe it's that time."
2,Le Carré as barking moonbat,"John Le Carré still writes beautifully, but this former master spywriter's latest book - set partly in the post 9/11, post-Iraq War world - boasts all the political nuance and acumen of a Ted Rail America-hating screed. It's a genuine pity to see that he's become a barking moonbat who's only a half-step back (if that) from the folks who seriously insist that the CIA directed the 9/11 attacks on instructions from Evil Dubya & Co. Once an author whom I eagerly bought in hardbound, he'll get no more of my bookbuying dollars (or pounds sterling or Euros)."
1,Not Worth Buying,"Once again, Douglass proves her inability to develop interesting, sympathetic characters. While sympathetic characters are not necessary to all stories and writing styles, it does not suit Douglass's. The characters in this story are cardboard cut-out characters. They do not progress or grow believably from one behavior to another. First they act in a certain way, then all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, they do a complete one-eighty.She tries to have heroes, but her heroes act so replusively that you cannot root for them. Or, they act so pathetically that you would rather scream at them then root for them.This writing style is choppy and does not progress well form one scene to another. Plot threads go nowhere. Actions happen for no apparent reason.I will not buy any more of Douglass's works, and I would recomment that you either check this book out from the library, or wait for it in paperback. It is not worth the hardback price."
1,The worst ever ......,What a waste of money and time. All the authors did were to copy from different books and pasted everything together. The worst book you can think of ......
5,I Love Cinnamon,"I used to buy 'Cinnamon Fire' at everyone's favorite super store, but for some reason they quit stocking it. It seemed to disappear from all the stores - mysteriously. I love cinnamon candy, and keep some around all the time. But 'Red Hots' are messy, 'Atomic Fireballs' leave my mouth dyed red, etc. 'Cinnamon Fire' comes individually wrapped, so I can carry a few in my pocket without worry of them sticking to stuff or worse, having stuff stick to them, they taste good (very good), and they don't dye my mouth red. I use Amazon's 'Subscribe and Save' service and get a box of 12 bags every month. My favorite candy, and its always handy!"
5,Delicious and medicinal....,"I LOVE anything cinnamon. This candy packs a big strong punch. Not only do we love to eat them whenever... I have found that when I have a sore throat or just itchies that they work better than any cough drop or lozenger BY FAR. If I could, I'd give it more than the normal 5 stars. YUMMMMM I do agree though, that we used to find these in a couple of our local stores, but all of the sudden, no one is carrying them anymore. It's SOOOO sad. Excited though that I could find them here at such a great price."
5,review,cute book - for co-worker who is having twins - I think she will love it and I got thing 1 and thing 2 onesies to go with it
4,Twin Babies Love Book,"This book has held the attention of my twin babies since I started reading it to them when they were just a couple months old. The rhymes really keep them amused for a few minutes.I enjoy this book as well. Although the illustrations could be better.Surprisingly, this book was not written by a mother of twins, but by a woman who had babies about 10 months apart. Regardless, it is still a great book for twins."
3,Twins,"I was a little disappointed. The pictures were cute, but not very good text. The book itself must have come from the bargain bin. It had a black marker across the top and the cover was smudged."
4,Fun For The Whole Family,"We are having so much fun with this video game! The songs are catchy, the graphics are amazing, the story is cute and most importantly, the kids are getting some exercise while playing. The only drawback, in my opinion, is the Storybook Mode. We found it extremely easy to solve and you only get to choose between Easy and Normal mode. However, once you get past that disappointment, the other features are great! Free Mode is where you can pick any song/dance you like at any level of difficulty from Easy to Super Hard. You can also choose to add Mush Mode where fun little Mario characters are thrown into the dance moves. The Free Mode is much more challenging and you are graded for your effort. (We have yet to get past a ""D"" on the Hard Level). There is also a calorie chart where you can keep track of how many calories are burned while playing.Overall, this is a great family game!!!"
5,In this day of age...we need more non-violent games like this.,"What I like about this game is that it is not violent in any way! Next is that because I played this game,I lost 3 pounds! so if you like DDR or losing weight, you will like this game!"
4,An extention to the popular dance dance revolution games.,Alright here it is.Proof that mario can do anything.He started out as a small hero but someone blowed him up like a baloon.Now theres mario in ssx on tour And street v3.But i NEVER expected THIS to happen!LET'S DANCE!I beleive those were the words.It starts out when a shady waluigi breaks into truffle towers and steals the sacred music keys that keep balance over the land that is mushroom kingdom.I expected you'd be able to play as mario luigi or anyone else.But just mario or luigi.Story mode is all too easy to beat.And i just expected to get more out of it.You can dance your way across story mode(with 5 worlds)and ex mode(also with 5 worlds).I'll close by saying it's alot better if you play it with an actual dance pad instead of a controller.happy dancing!
2,"The game is super fun, but we had to buy a new one, because this game wouldn't let us play anything but the demo.","The game is super fun. We love Mario DDR. However, we had to buy a new one, because this game wouldn't let us play anything but the demo. Everytime we would try to play the story mode, an error message would appear on the screen."
5,Mind blowing Performance,Pt Hari Prasad Chaurasia a Living Legend`s best performances recorded.A set of four cd`s a lifetime investment.His Flute delivers soothing sounds never heard of.There is no limit and no words to describe the legendry performance.
4,A great reference book,This book is compact and contains extremely useful information about cleaning some very commonplace things that you're never really sure how to clean.
1,Pretty well wuthless...,"I didn't know much about cleaning - and I still don't after browsing this book. Full of generalized & fairly obvious observations about cleaning that anybody whose ever picked up a broom or mop could tell you.I have had a few specific issues I had hoped this book would provide guidance on, such as smoke stains. Forget it, there's nothing, nada, zippo on this common problem. I can't remember the other ones, but I know I've learned more just by browsing the instructions on the containers in the cleaning products section at K-mart.Ironic, this book is put out by Consumer Reports, the people who are supposed to PREVENT rip offs..."
3,"Good safety glasses, good sunglasses","I bought these not just for eye protection but they double as a good pair of sunglasses. Just one or two drawbacks.One, they are big. I have a big face and head and they are still big on me. They tend to slip a little and I have to adjust them often.Two, there are numbers and letters engraved right on the lenses. Only really visible in bright sunlight (sigh). More visible when they slip down your nose (double sigh).These are not desired qualities for sunglasses, nor for safety glasses."
1,Too Loose!,"I have an average size head, if not a little on the large side. These glasses either slip or fall off every time I am looking down to work on something. They are fine for someone that just wants to wear them as glasses, but for people who are actually using them on the job, I would definitely not reccomend. Anytime you have to look down, they will fall off."
3,"Ok for DVDs, but needs some work","First of all there is something wrong with it's construction. It's hard to explain. There are these tabs inside that get in the way, and because of these every other dvd doesn't go in right. What I had to do was get some pliers and tear them out. Took like 10 min. I know it's hard to understand what I'm talking about, but once you get it you will understand. After I got rid of these tabs it worked fine. Of course I shouldn't have to do this for it work correctly. Just giving fair warning. I recommend it if you don't mind modifying it."
5,Great Daddy Book!,"Mrs. Seahorse has given Mr. Seahorse the very important task of taking care of their babies and Mr. Seahorse is proud to do it! This is a delightful tale in classic Eric Carle style that follows a daddy seahorse through the ocean where it meets other daddy fishes taking good care of their babies. Not only does it highlight fathers, it models good sentence structure and polite greetings between fishes, er people. As an added plus this book also has fun interactive transparent inlays that hide a dangerous fish that Mister seahorse passes by. You lift the overlay to spy the scary fish! Colorful, classic, and charming, Mister Seahorse has been a surefire hit with our little ocean lovers!"
3,Mister Seahorse,"I really liked this book but I feel that the condition wasn't accurate. When I ordered it, nothing was mentioned about the holes that went all the way through the book in the middle of the pages. I was disappointed with that but I bought it to read to my preschool class along with another Eric Carle book, A House for Hermit Crab,and the class enjoyed both of them."
2,Where is Mom?,"This is a beautifully illustrated book, and while it's refreshing to see a storybook that focuses on fathering, the conspicuous and near-complete absence of mothers gives a perhaps-unintended but harmful message - are they all CEOs in some underwater corporation? And describing a father's care for his children as babysitting is unforgivable. So close and yet so far..."
1,Not gonna buy!,"I took a look at this book because Family Fun magazine liked it, but the now infamous babysitting comment (see other reviews) irked the heck out of me, and I refuse to buy it. Sad, because it's a beatifully illustrated book, but I just find that the most utterly sexist comment. I agree with another poster that said it's PARENTING, not babysitting! Eric, get a life!"
2,Mediocre - wait for the paperback,"I LOVE Nora Roberts' work. I've gotten everyone at the office hooked on her, too. I own every novel in hardcover that was printed in hardcover. Up until now, I've never considered it a waste of money. I should have waited for the paperback. Lately we've been waiting too long for something to come, this could have waited a little longer. Perhaps Nora Roberts could have thought of a better ending. The ending was a real letdown. When reading this book, the reader was constantly waiting to get to the good part, and then it was over - surprise - no good part. I was pretty disappointed. When's the next one coming out?"
2,the villa,I never expected to see the day I would get a Nora Roberts book that I just didn't care for but the villa is that book. I kept turning back to the cover to be sure this was a nora roberts book & not something that danielle steel had written before she got her act together . I guess it had to happen sometime but I am truly dissappointed the plot never jelled the characters didn't interact & the story just didn't come together in the usual roberts fashion -sorry nora I will of course buy your next book--but just not so fast
3,The Villa is good not great....,"Rare is the time I would give a Nora Roberts book less than four stars. And it's not that this book is bad, three stars is worth a read. However this book is not as great as I 've come to expect a Robert's book to be. For my taste she has too many characters stuffed into one story which leaves little room for thorough characterization. I would have preferred more time was spent with the two main characters, Ty and Sophia."
3,Undercooked....,"First off, I too am a devoted Nora R. fan and it is because of that that I can say this work does not represent what she is capable of as a fictional romance and mystery writer.She had the ingredients here for a superb story, characters, plot, setting, etc. and had obviously done her research; however, the main characters were not developed to their full potential and depth as is Nora's usual style and that was sorely missed. The ending was such a disappointment. Plainly said, I just didn't buy it at all! Also, what was the incredible RUSH at the end? Spend the time to wrap it up right! Sophia and Ty would have made a wonderful story for this book and save the others for later.The makings are still here for Nora to back up and tell the story of the grandparents, David's daughter and son as they grow into relationships, to expand into the family as so many of our favorite series do. But, take the time and do it well. We'll all be glad you did!"
1,Skip This One....,"As a long-time Roberts fan, I snagged this tantalizingly thick paperback right away....and was so disappointed. Cliche characters, flat dialogue, and a beautiful setting (CA's wine country) completely wasted. Gave me the feeling that maybe this is one of her very early works that hadn't been published before. I just finished her ""Seaswept"" and enjoyed it so much more!"
1,Complete Piece of Junk,We bought 3 of these for two different locations. 100% of them have failed with the same problem. If the power goes out even for a few seconds the unit shuts down completely taking the servers along with it. The problem is that it appears to be doing it's job but when it really matters you find out otherwise. Tripp Lite has been good to replace them but it can't restore my faith in their power protection products. Also of note the batteries in the Tripp Lite units are half the size of those in APC products with the same rating.
1,"Apparently ""U"" does not mean ""Uninterruptible""","Once the batteries get old, or run low, this ""UPS"" will drop power to the connected equipment without warning. Apparently it tests the batteries by switching the actual load over to the batteries, instead of running an internal test and alerting you when the batteries are low. I contacted Tripp Lite support about this issue, and they claimed that this is standard behavior. Obviously someone at Tripp Lite has failed to grasp the basic concept of an ""uninterruptible"" power supply. If you want an actual UPS, buy something else."
4,Very Good Album,"The artist reminds me of James Taylor. One Mistake, Closer to the Surface, and Falling into it are fantastic. Can't wait to see the next release from Jim Bizer. Give this album a chance...you won't regret it!"
5,"Witty, funny storytelling about life and early Hollywood","This book and the one following (""Bring on the Empty Horses"") just might be my two favorite books, EVER. I practically insist every friend I make read them. Niven had a very unique life, and had a rare gift for story-telling that makes these books real treasures. They are laugh-out-loud, effortlessly funny stories that tell us of his entry into Hollywood (an unusual career path, it involved prohibition, fish and polo) as well as his checkered career in the military in England. I guarantee you'll read these two books over and over again. I just wish he'd written more of them!"
5,A Touching Personal Memoir,"This is the personal history of one of those amazing 20th century lives. Made better when read by the author. (For all the Hollywood dirt you've got to hear ""Bring On The Empty Horses!"")"
4,Straps get uneven but otherwise excellent,"This bag being 100% canvas including straps is really nice. You can wear the zipper compartment on your back or have the big with the zipper facing out. The fact that the straps and bag are all canvas is really nice as the colors and fabric all match. However, the straps are doubled up and can easily get so that one part of the double is longer than the other. It's an annoying flaw. The color is nice. For the price, it is perfectly fine, but I wish the straps were better done."
5,A Nice Headset & A Good Price,"I use headsets with my cordless phones, because I have friends I talk to for hours at a time. Holding the phone to my ear, I find my arms and shoulders get tired.So I bought a headset years ago. I loved it, but it finally died. I've been looking for one just like it, and this one fit the bill. It has the same longer than average, flexible boom microphone (with the foam anti-wind cover) and a headset that doesn't try to crush my skull. I have tried so many, and I very highly recommend this one. It has a ""mute"" button, so I can press it, answer a question from my husband, or shoo a cat off the couch, then press it again, and there's no interruption of the conversation with my friend.This isn't a necessity, by any means, but if you're a talker, you should have this. You can talk longer, more comfortably! It uses the standard 2.5 jack most cordless phones have. I really do love this thing. (And my husband finally got a headset, too - he talks as long as I do!!)"
5,Good album with a range of music styles,"I like this album coz it showcases her versatility & experiment with different music styles. Great songs include ""Gypsy"", ""Blood Makes Noise"", ""No Cheap Thrill"", ""Small Blue Thing"", ""Left of Center"", ""Marlene On The Wall"" and of course not forgetting ""Luka"" and ""Tom's Diner"". In fact most of the songs here are good. Go get it!"
1,"She should be a writer, not a singer .............","I never liked any of her songs on the radio even though I thought she had a good voice. I figured if I bought a ""best of"" with 17 tracks on it, I'd have to find one I liked. But no. They're all emotionally cold and distancing. Some are interesting stories, but the music is always superfluous."
4,Creative inspiration!,"The New Wave, not only was one of the most artistic and creative outbursts in France. Aldemaro Romero(1928-2007) after a long stage in New York during the last fifties and early sixties, knew to blend the recent Bossa Nova with the folkloric Venezuelan music to generate a pleasant musical movement that established the most praising comments."
1,NEED INSTRUCTIONS,PROBLEM WITH BENDER THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO INSERT ROD AND HOW TO USE THE ARM - BUILT WELL BUT TRIED EVERY WAY POSSIBLE. THEN JUST THREW IT ON THE WORK BENCH. WILL ORDER ONE WITH PINS THAT CAN BE MOVED.
1,History for the WWF generation,"I bought this book ... and I had few expectations of greatness; good thing, because this book is simply a rehash of old facts, put in a blender on frappe and extruded into a clumsy glop.... This is just about the worst book on the San Francisco earthquake and fire I have ever read. I can only recommend it as a starting point--go to any book cited in the bibliography for a more accurate, clearly written account. On the other hand, if you are only really interested in second-hand accounts of lost loved ones, vivid depictions of deaths, and hysterical accounts of rat migrations, this will serve admirably."
3,A quick and easy picture of the quake and fire...,"Disaster seems to want to be a lively, fiction-style approach to the events, but suffers from a lack of depth and from the absence of any usable central characters. So we don't quite get a point of view strong enough to paint a compelling subjective experience, nor enough depth and detail to create a strong objective study.Instead we land somewhere in between. Not a bad book, though some of the historic conclusions seem open to debate. It does have some nice little anecdotes, and can be read cover to cover in a light afternoon, so this might make a good overview or starting point for someone approaching the subject. Young readers would also find this handy.If you want to see this type of historical writing done well, pick up David McCullough's book about the Johnstown Flood."
3,Close but no Cigar,"This book could have been a masterpiece. Parts of the book portray the compelling human drama of the San Francisco earthquake and fire as if you were there. Other parts are disjointed and confusing. The problem is that the author is unable to connect these seemingly random human events into a coherent whole. In all fairness, perhaps this is impossible to do given the complexity of the event. It doesn't help, however, that the author completely gets the geology of the earthquake wrong at the very beginning of the book. In spite of all these criticisms, this book is worth reading. In several chapters, the author accomplishes the impossible. He is able to describe the experiences of individuals, combine them to make a convincing whole, and make you feel as if you were there! If only the whole book could have been like that."
3,Decent ear protection,"The ear protection is good, better than the $7.00 ones I has before. I always use them in combination with the rollup foam ear protection as well. A good buy all around."
4,"A little tight, but great!","That says it all. You have to stretch and bend it a bit to make it comfortable for larger heads, but once on it is comfortable and VERY effective."
3,Only works on a Naked Head,"These earmuffs won't work well if you wear a hat, wig or even thick rimmed glasses or anything that interferes with the contact of the ear cups against the head. They are very obvious, stick out farther than I would've guessed from looking at the pictures and draw stares - so I'll stick with 32 NRR earplugs which work just as well anyway."
1,Misleading Presentation of Product,"For the price these are decent ear protection earmuffs. They in no way ""Noise Canceling"" and ""Professional...."" is a gross exaggeration."
3,Peltor H10A Professional Noise Canceling Earmuff,Ok ~!!I don't leave feedback but I like the Earmuff but there are not Noise canceling earmuff with no battery they are vary nice safety earmuffs but Amazon.com is misleading with Professional Noise canceling Earmuffs and they don't cancel nothing they are standard safety earmuffs so I have not decided to return the other set yet ?
5,second set of Peltors....and I love em',"Anyone looking for quality ear protection this one for you. Fit around head very comfortable, adjust very easy, and with these things on you can barly hear a thing. Just what the ""woodshop doctor"" ordered. Made of high quality impact plastic, these will last for a long time."
5,Best purchase I made in a long time,This is the best investment into my shop I have made. I do a ton of metal fabrication and these work great. The fit is fantastic and noise reduction is amazing. Being able to quickly put on and take off has resulted in me using every time I am grinding or cutting. I will never buy anythin else for hearing protection again
4,Good Earmuffs,"These earmuffs do an excellent job at reducing sound. I was previously using a pair of loaners and needed to wear plugs as well. The Peltors work so well that I was able to dispense with the plugs. They are fairly comfortable, the part that goes around your ear is plastic, so on hot days you will sweat, no different from any other earmuff I suspect. They work well with safety glasses, a very small increase in noise due to the seal against the ear being broken. I wear my safety glasses over the top of the muffs, so the seal is not broken. They stay in place pretty well.Plugs are a bit more comfortable, but they are no match for the Peltors in terms of sound reduction. These muffs are a bargain."
4,A MUST for College students,"These are a lifesaver! I couldn't survive my first yar of college without them. You see, I live in a co-ed dormitory and there are a;ways drunk people making lots of noise well into the wee hours of the morning and girls yelling at their boyfriends on the phone right outside of my door. I couldn't sleep more than three hours a night my first week of college. Then i bought these babies! I couldn't hear anything with these on. The reason i gave these only 4 stars was because for the first month i wore them, i got really bad ear/headaches because they're so tight."
2,Doesn't block THAT much,"One of the reviewers said these were effective at blocking out annoying office noise, or neighborhood noise. Not true. Even when you follow the instructions (i.e., avoid glasses, hair, and anything intrusive under the padding), they still let in noise. These are probably appropriate for machinery and sounds in a certain decibel range, but not for reducing office or noisy neighbor noise."
4,Just what w needed,Ordered 2 pairs of these for the wife and I. Use them at them at the indoor pistol range.. Nice and easy to adjust and work great for keeping the noise to a minimum. A great buy!
2,Does Not Eliminate Low Frequency Sound,"Purchased for purpose of ELIMINATING low frequency sound pressure/vibration from apartment neighbors, i.e. as in improving reading/relaxing environment. Hoped that product would create vacuum seal about the ears. Sound is reduced, but disappointed that I can still hear low freq vibration/sounds; in fact while wearing the product, low-freq sound vibrations seem to be clarified/intensified. Don't doubt product claims to protect ears from LOUD volume sounds, but that was not my main goal. The product presses on nerves of face, and around ear, so wearing time is limited, as soreness results after about 45 minutes."
4,Does the job for the price,"We bought this for block out when using machines out in the yard and my husband cannot hear me when i'm talking to him, so bonus points for that for him ;). This works great and much better than the earplugs he was using. The only con is this happened to fit my husband but not sure if it is adjustable for different head sizes. For the price point it does the job."
4,GOOD BUY,"EXCELLENT NOISE REDUCTION, THE ONLY REASON IT DIDNT GET A FIVE STAR REVIEW IS THE HEAD STRAP IS NOT ADJUSTABLE"
3,good and bad,"It's pretty easy to break down this product-- 1. Good:they block noise very well, 2. Bad: they are uncomfortable to wear. I ended up returning them, and will try to find a more comfortable pair of earmuffs."
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"My ears are a bit sensitive to high pitched sounds such as carpet steam cleaner, hammering nails, vacuuming, etc. (plus I just think it is important to protect your ears). I didn't want the type of headphones that require batteries and are noise canceling-too complicated for me. I just wanted a simple type headphone that I could take on and off with out adjusting. I like the fact that it cuts down on high pitched sounds while allowing me to still hear people talking to me. I use these all the time."
4,Great for the price.,"I don't have anything to compare them against, but they do a great job silencing TVs and wives that speak Portuguese. Most people seem to buy them for the fire range --- I'm all about safety; and, I'll certainly use them in more reasonable applications that test their ability but they probably block out 97% of audible sound at 10 ft from the TV which means I can finally be in the room while the wife watches E!'s Kendra (reality TV).The construction seems slightly flimsy and is all plastic with two very high gauge (thin) metal wires. I'm not sure how long they will last, but hey 20.00 and great performance."
2,Only for Alan Bates and Sinead Cusack fans,"This movie is only for Bates and Cusak fans.The story is only a pretext to showcase the actors. Is too vague, unfocused,too long. It has its nice moments and beautiful scenery, but that's it."
1,Disappointing!,"I had read many positive reviews for this book so I took a chance. Boy was I sorry I spent the $25. I did not think the main character was believable in his role as security guard turned super hero. And all the instances of sex made me think this was written by a 14 year old. I thought the pace was wooden and plodded along. As a reader I simply did not care for the outcome of each character. The dialogue at times was trite and trivial. Finally, the cover of the book is one of the worst I have seen for this genre. It does not seem to fit the right time period. What am I missing? I have seen beeter POD covers."
5,A great example of what this band can do,"With The Haunted, the Bjorler brothers add a more metalcore singer and sound to their music. And what do the originators of Gothenburg do when they have a run in with the americanized version of the genre they started?They kill it.This is in every conceivable way better than Slipknot, Killswitch Engage or basically any other metalcore/mallcore band that has been made to this day.Why you may ask?Because they add genuine anger to their music, and not just manufactured angst to sell records to angry teenagers. They also have musical talent, with the Bjorler brothers's thrashy guitaring(/bassing) and Adrian Erlanndsson's amazingly heavy and fast(but not tasteless like Dimmu Borgir) drumming. This album has basically confirmed to me that anything America has done on the metal scene, Sweden has done better."
3,Connecticut Four piece smooth hard core recording,"In the early 90's Mindwar become one of the best hard core bands in Connecticut. After the release of a wonderful split 7"" w/ fellow CT band Evolve and a self released demo(tracks from both are re-done here) Mindwar was known as an fierce yet emotional hard working band with bass lines providing the melody and the intricate guitar leeds holding your attention. This full length is a nice easy package of some of the bands finest work, which was becoming hard to find. Pick this up if love the hard core sound of the early 90's ala BURN or SUPERTOUCH!"
3,Not sure that it really does anything.,I used this product the first month after having my son and it's soft and easy to put on but I'm not sure it really did a whole lot in terms of healing. Kind of expensive in that case. Much easier to put on than lanolin b/c it's thinner and gets more liquidy.
5,Breastfeeding must have,You simply must have this item for breastfeeding. It goes on very smooth. It has an oily texture. It is MUCH easier on you than another commonly recommended product. I really love this stuff and highly recommend it to anyone looking to breastfeed or pump.
5,Must have for pumping,"I couldn't have pumped without this cream. All the other creams and lotions that you buy are sticky, not what you need for pumping. This cream is slick, take all of the torture out of pumping. Also the ingredients are fine for breast milk so you don't have to get worried about some getting in the milk or about nursing after you have used it. This is one of the items that I always buy all my friends who are having babies. Every mother should know about this."
5,"Seriously, the BEST","I can't say enough positive things about this nipple cream. It is by far and away the best, and believe me, I've tried almost everyone out there, including the Lansinoh cream. I used it multiple times per day as I pumped 10x/day for my premature babies, and again as I was learning to breastfeed. It made my sore nipples feel better instantly on contact, and kept them moisturized and pain free (relatively!). Most importantly, it was safe for my babies to ingest, which was a real concern for me, as the last thing you want to have to do is wipe something off your nipples right after putting it on! A single jar lasted me several months, and now I give it to every new mom for a baby shower gift! Seriously, you won't be disappointed."
4,Great product for maintenance,"This nipple cream is really nice because it goes on smoothly and much easier than lanolin (lansinoh is other product i have used), which is a must for sore nipples. The size doesn't bother me for two reasons: 1) I doubt I will ever make my way through this little tub-it isn't like nipples are that big, and 2) I pay for department store make up, so this isn't a shocker. If you buy Walgreens cheaper brands, you will probably be shocked at how much this costs for the amount you get. Anyway...I like it, however, for really cracked nipples that came with the first week or so, this didn't do as well as pure lanolin--maybe it just rubbed off on nursing pads or on my bra. My recommendation is use the lansinoh at first then switch to this. It's really nice."
5,Great BUT Not Needed,"I bought this because my baby didn't like the taste of other creams. It is a fantastic cream EXCEPT I have found that expressing some breast milk after feedings works better than any cream. I might try to find another use for it but for me right now, breast milk is working much better than anything else (and it's free!)."
3,"A Simply ""Okay"" Product","Because of all the great things that I've heard about this product, I purchased it before baby was due. I don't get cracked or sore nipples often and find that when I use it, it is too oily for me. Since I have no reason to use it frequently, I wouldn't purchase again. My advice would be to wait until you are sure you will use and need it. If you need something ASAP than you can always use your own breast milk."
1,Allergic reaction,"I was given this product in the hospital. My face swelled up and stayed that way for several hours despite treatment. Everyone is different, obviously. Use with caution!"
5,Makes everything better,"My wife was having a lot of trouble with feeding our peanut due to the fact that the little one is a champion cluster feeder. Wanted to feed 6-7 times in 4 or 5 hours is par for the course so far, and as you can imagine that led to a lot of soreness. We tried the medela and lanisoh version of lanolin, tried the medela soft shields for airing out, even warm/cold washcloths. Nothing came close to this. I got this on a whim for her and the day she used it she started to feel much better. If soreness is a problem for you, definitely give this a try!"
5,Neil Sedaka memories,My Dad asked for this album and adding it to another purchase gave me free shipping because the order was more than $25. It was like getting the album for free. This also demonstrates the wide array of products available at Amazon.com. Why go anywhere else?
5,This Soundtrack is truly on of the best of all time,"Each song featured on the soundtrack is a classic just like the film. My favourite song is 'I had the time of my life', when I hear it I want to dance and wish I had Patrick Swayze dancing beside me!"
1,Total disaster,"Disaster all round!I wanted to buy a CD named ""I wanna tell you"" by Patrick Sweeny. I found that Amazon had one for sale, so clicked on the item. After I had placed an order, I looked more closely at the screen which was in front of me. I noticed that it had a picture of the Sweeny album, but the text said ""Stone by stone"" by the Limestones. I noticed this after I had ordered, a few minutes later, and emailed the seller. No reply. The incorrect album duly arrived.Amazon is at fault in mixing up the correct picture with the wrong album. The seller is at fault by ignoring my email.Everyone is to blame. I've kept the unwanted album - no point in getting into lengthy negotiation...John Titford"
5,A great collection of early material.,"Forget what that last guy said. Terminal Tower is NOT a best-of collection. It is a collection of the band's earliest (and most obscure) singles. Short of buying the boxed-set (which is the bands ENTIRE albums and SINGLES from 75-82), this is your best bet for some of the greatest ""on-the-edge"" rock n' roll you can find. So far ahead of their time that the world hasn't even caught up."
2,It's okay.. but wanders a bit,"The book was not what I hoped for. She puts on good presentations, but the book just didn't come across as clearly to me."
5,Excellent,"Very cohesive presentation. Coverage is primarily limited to fundamental and intermediate web graphics. Would like to see author present more advanced topics as her style is such a pleasure to read, and so easy to follow."
4,Heartwarming,"I had very high expectations for this movie. Perhaps if I had watched it without these expectations I would have liked it more. It is a heartwarming story of a man, a war hero, who goes to school at an advanced age because he wants to learn to read so he can read a letter he received. It is an excellent movie, but a little formulaic. Perhaps that is unavoidable as it is a true story so they can't change things too much. Very good, but not the best movie I have seen this decade. I am glad I saw it, but wish I could have rented instead of purchased it."
3,"maudlin, as expected",but the film is a useful visual on the conditions of education in rural Kenya. Good for classroom use (with discussion!)
5,"Knowing the Past, Helps us Navigate a Better Future","In American schools we learn little to nothing of the true history of the world. Movies like this, based on a true story may be hard to swallow, but provide us the opportunity to create a better future for our world.It is sad and amazing the numerous ways throughout the centuries people have devised (and continue to devise) to torture each other for self-proclaimed noble causes. It is equally sad that each succeeding generation understands little of its past, and therefore constructs a very superficial present and future.Our brightest hope is in a future built upon a solid foundation in Jesus Christ and all that He teaches. All that we as men come up with pales in comparison."
2,Poorly written,"I thought the topic seemed interesting. The writing is hard to follow, tons of names which probably mean a lot to the author but not to the reader. It reminded me of memoirs written by family members, great if you know them, but only if you do. Too few facts, too many personal experiences which are of little interest to people outside the family circle."
2,SHOULD HAVE SKIPPED IT---,"First, not a romance as there were only two ""intimate scenes"" about three sentences each with a kiss, a poke, and a sigh. The hero even turns his back to the heroine immediately after the first time and falls asleep. Secondly, the rest of the story was very slow going causing me to resort to reading a few words per paragraph just to get through it. Characters were flat and never held my attention. This was my first J A Krentz novel. Won't be rushing out to try another."
1,No consistency,"The entire story was just set to mislead you, not to have you to mis-reading the characters or situations with a thrilling surprise. Not a suspense or thriller. Too many unreal behaviors. Very disappointing."
4,The Perfect Gataway,"This movie was good, you need to really watch it closely to really know what's going on. I would recommend this if you like action movies and not only romance."
2,Ordered new DVD; recieved USED one; BEWARE!,There's nothing more disappointing than paying for one thing and recieveng another.I paid for a new DVD and the one I rec'd was definitely USED!The packaging was warped all over as if it had been dropped in water or got too hot somewhere!It's the ugliest DVD in my collection...ugh!The movie was great; that's why I ordered it. This was my 1st and last DVD from Amazon.......so disappointed!!I doubt this will get posted!!!!! BEWARE!
4,Purrfectly Played,"Cat and mouse games.....who is who....will the real married couple please stand up! Ok, so the actual story line has been used before. So what. What matters here is this movie entertains. There's enough going on to keep you guessing through out the movie as to whom is whom and what in the heck is going on. Ok, there are a few predictable parts. However, there is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat as well. Nice sick twist at the end to boot. To some degree once the twist has been learned it sort of takes out the main thrust of this movie...to a point. Again, it comes down to entertainment value. This movie keeps the sail raised in that category!"
3,RCA should indeed be held to high standards,"I thought this was OK until I heard better, namely the JSP 5-CD set. True, John R.T. Davies leaves in more surface noise, but he also leaves in more music. RCA's remastering is tolerable but very far from exemplary. Robert Parker's ""Great Original Performances"" series is also preferable. There are two of these for Jelly Roll Morton.There's also some overlap with another RCA single CD product, ""Jelly's last jam : original music from the motion picture"". I don't know if that one's still available.The ""Victor"" in RCA-Victor comes from the Victor which recorded Jelly Roll in the Webster Hotel in Chicago in 1926 with state-of-the-art electronic equipment. Suddenly we could hear everything the musicians were doing. And what musicians!RCA-Victor (or is it ""BMG"" these days?)should live up to this heritage."
2,"Hurried, incomplete mathematical treatment and undefined","The authors look hurried to catch the wave of wavelets and compiled hot topics of the publication date without almost any logical order. Lots of material taken from others' papers without generosity in the references. The book is missing to tell readers its purpose! Is it a mathematical treatment of wavelet transforms or an engineering book? I could not answer this question as a doctoral student. It's very much like a Ph.D. dissertation of the second author. Frankly, I was disappointed with the quality of the book from a known researcher like Prof. Vetterli."
5,No Problems to report,"I have been using the ""Ridata 1GB ULTRA High-Speed 150X Secure Digital (SD) Card"". No problems to report. Works as promised.- b"
1,Not the ALBUM,"I just downloaded this and it is not the album. The album has 15 songs, this download is 8. What the hell"
5,A first-rate book by a first-time novelist.,"_Vinegar Hill_ is, ultimately, a story about differentperspectives, the different views held by a group of familymembers watching the collapse of old traditions and, on amuch more personal level, the collapse of a marriage. Mansaydeals with some of the toughest problems of family andrelationships, using characters you will alternately hateand care for."
4,A tasty morsel.,Well Oprah's had a few clunkers including the awful Tara Road but Vinegar Hill is very very good. When you read it keep reminding yourself that it's 1972. I was so angry with the protaganist until I reminded myself of that one fact. Enjoy a quick read.
3,leaves a bitter taste in your mouth,"The writing is good, but the story is so depressing, there are no happy or funny or good moments. The final two pages offer a brief glimpse of possible hope, but otherwise, the main character's life is thorough hell. The vivid depiction of the mother-in-law's early days of her marriage are harrowing and creepy."
3,Something to offer,"I didnt expect to really like this book, having read lots of the reviews. I waited for it to be unbearable but it never got bad. It was sad and depressing but that's how life can be for many. I think any book can give a message and the one I got from this book is a reminder of how far-reaching abusive living situations can be. I was also reminded of a time not long ago when women truly had no options or choices, once marriage was entered into.It is sad to think many women wouldn't have taken their children and left the situation. Many are living this way today."
1,Vinegar Hill - Sour taste,"I find it hard to believe that Oprah read this book before recommeding it to millions of people all over the world. Normally, I am a big fan of her selections (She's Come Undone, I Know this Much is True, Midwives, just to name a few) but this book was just plain awful. The story never went anywhere and I didn't care about any of the characters, especially Ellen. Ellen was in desperate need of a personality and a backbone. The in-laws were angry, frustrated and unhappy and the husband was cold, unfeeling and insensitive. I waited for over two hundred pages for something shocking or exciting to happen -- something that would redeem this book and justify the hours wasted, but it never came. I only gave this book one star because I wasn't sure if there was a NO Star option."
4,In-law Hell,"Anyone who is married has, I'm sure, had moments that they wished their inlaws were not theirs. But this book takes that a step further. Dysfunction at its best. This book was real because the victims were not only the daughter-in-law, but the entire family. It shows how the past can make you stronger and good does eventually come to those who make it happen!"
2,I kept waiting for something to happen...,"When I first started this book, I enjoyed the way the author allowed us to feel Ellen's feelings and experience her life. But as I kept reading, it just got harder and harder to continue. I kept rooting for her to leave, to get her act together. I knew that it would take her a while to build up the courage due to the time period, but I was willing to keep reading provided she did leave in the end. I was also looking forward to her telling her husband she was leaving, to her telling off her in-laws, to her anger and frustration springing forth. Sadly, this never happened and that is why I am rating this book so low. This novel had a great conflict, excellent rising action, and even a climax of sorts, but lacked in denoument and resolution. I wanted closure, and received none. I feel like there needs to be a sequel where she moves on just to get the whole story!"
2,hard to continue reading,"I found this book a little too difficult to pick back up, and start reading, maybe it was because I was distracted at the beach, but I wasn't that surprised by the ending, I think Ellen should have come to her senses alot sooner, and James needed to find his back bone! The book was somewhat enjoyable, though, not meaning to cut the book apart."
2,And the plot is what...?,"It was an okay book, and I was into it most of the time, but I didn't think there was much of a plot. Ansay is a great writer - I like her word choices, but I just wanted more to happen."
1,Quite disappointing,"I have read a few of Oprah's picks and this one has to be the worst! Where are the characters that you feel something for? I kept thinking, WHO CARES, but kept reading, hoping that I would grow to care for them. I liked one character -- the mother who killed the babies! She should have been expanded on -- she was the only one who knew the doldrums of the daughter's life to come, and for the readers to come as well!"
2,Hope there's going to be a sequel!,"Two things: it's a good thing this book was short, and I hope there's going to be a sequel. I suffered so much with Ellen that I found myself resenting my OWN husband, even though my life in no way resembles hers. I certainly hope we're going to get to find out what happens to Ellen and her children. Who cares what happens to that weak husband of hers and his disgusting father? I found the characters to be a little too caricatured for my taste, but I did enjoy this quick read."
4,The in-laws from hell!,"If you ever had a bad in-law experience, this book might help to put things in perspective. It could be worse, you could have in-laws like the one's in this book."
1,Vinegar Hill,"I read the book hoping, as I turned each page, that things would look up. It was well written, kept my interest, but I would not recommend to anyone, as I found it so disappointing. Yes, reality can be depressing, but this was gross, too, and I found it a little unbelievable. I didn't feel it was worth my time, and there was nothing to gain from reading this book. It is a story of a pretty pathetic family, and although the main character, Ellen seems to have a brain, she doesn't seem to use it. At least not till the the end, and then you still are somewhat left hanging. Some depressing stories can make you feel grateful about your life. This is not one of those....It doesn't make sense that Ellen put up with it...the 70's just weren't like that."
1,What a depressing useless read,"Vinegar Hill was terrible. Not only was it depressing but, it wreaked of hopelessness. What a terrible, meaningless, a-spiritual read! Shame on Oprah for recommending such a waste of time book."
5,Ansay is one of the best fiction writers in our country.,"I have read many of Ansay's works, including-- just by luck-- a few of her earliest stories. This novel shares with all of her writing her amazing combination of unflinching toughness and unsappy tenderness."
2,Another Oprah Flop,"This book just kept skipping and skipping. After reading a chapter, the next would be so totally off that I wondered all the time what is this author talking about. The only book from Oprah's Book Club that I totally enjoyed was ""Songs in Ordinary Time. Maybe, one day I'll try another of the authors books, but not right now."
4,GOOD STORY!,"I liked the writing and the characters, but the secret was too predictable. I also liked the feel of the story and the imagery was wonderful. A good book to sit down and read in one evening. If anyone is interested in a great spiritual thriller, I would highly recommend a novel called, THE FIST OF GOD by A.T. Nicholas. A super 'good vs evil' story set during a presidential campaign. A very spiritual and insightful read."
2,Don't waste your time,"Please do not waste your time reading this book. It is extremely slow and boring. I continued reading, waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. I have enjoyed most of Oprah's choices, but not this one. Very disappointing!"
2,Vinegar Hill,"I have read many, if not most, of the Oprah's Book Club books. I have enjoyed the majority of them, albeit in varying degrees. This was my least favorite. It was slow-moving. I hung in there waiting for something to happen, some thread of hope, some reward. Although the reviews on the book cover say the reward comes in the last sentence, it wasn't a big enough reward for me. I don't have the patience to give 2 days to reading a book for one quasi-fulfilling sentence."
3,Sometimes confusing.,"Vinegar Hill was all in all a good book. I was touched by the hardships the women in the novel were forced to endure. The characters are developed in a way that allows us to either love or hate each of them. My feelings were passionate toward all of them. However, throughout the novel, the reader expects something wonderful to happen to at least one of the characters. A happy ending. The lack of this may, however, be the draw to the novel. At times the book becomes confusing due to the endless change of narrator and the switching from past to present. This novel does not sugar-coat anything. If you are looking for a book without a fairy-tale ending, that honestly depicts life and demonstrates to the reader that things don't always turn out perfectly, this is it."
2,Vinegar Hill Review,"I felt this book was overall, very depressing. I could not relate to the main character because the book is set in a time where women were very subordinate to their husbands and I thought her decision about her terrible marriage, which did not come until the very last chapter, was not worth the wait."
3,Acid melancholy.,"I enjoyed its acidic melancholy. But really... I think I need to watch a week of Disney films to pull me back out of the well.A woman trapped in a loveless, sexless marraige seeing for the first time the choices around her and the choices that others have made.The distance that her sisters and mother place on Ellen really surprised me. Their disappointment in her failure to fulfill her husband in all the ways a good wife should just blow my mind. The embarassment she is going to cause the family.A story about the life of Salome might be interesting... more of her strange angle.And the whole of idea of all the strange angels in our lives.It wasn't the feel-good-hit of the Summer. But a good read all the same."
1,Hard to read.,I can't believe I actually finished this book. The characters were totally dispicable and so was the story. There was no one to connect with in the whole book and it was too unbelievable. It was not a good Oprah pick - what a let down.
5,Another MST3K winner,"I have the original version with the Godzilla movie (no, I didn't send it back when it was recalled), but if I know the MST3K crew, the Gila Monster is probably at least close to being as good. Anyway, you'll probably want to buy this for the Mike Connors vehicle ""Swamp Diamonds"": jail breaking female inmates, undercover female cops, guns, ropes, Mannix and diamonds...in a swamp! Set against stock footage of Mardi Gras in New Orleans, you can almost feel the heat! The best thing about MST3K DVD's is you can watch them over and over and still get plenty of laughs out of them, a la, ""Oh yeah, now I remember. They did say that!"" I don't think this is the best set, but it is excellent and a lot of fun."
5,A GREAT READ ON WHO WE ARE AS A NATION,"PRIME MINISTER CHURCHILL'S WRITINGS ON AMERICA HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFULLY EDITED BY HIS GRANDSON. THE SELECTIONS PROVIDE A LOOK AT OURSELVES BY A SUPREMELY ARTICULATE AUTHOR WHO WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS AMERICAN HERITAGE. WHEN SEEN THROUGH CHURCHILL'S EYES, MANY ASPECTS OF AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT TAKE ON A NEW AND DEEPER MEANING. THE LANGUAGE AND THE SCHOLARSHIP ARE SUPERB, AS EXPECTED."
1,A book that never gets read in the house,"This book looked promising but I'm sorry to say that I have not gone past the first few pages.Churchill's writing style is very dry (no matter what they say) and his sentences about historical events are full of summaries and platitudes. I'm not sure where he gets his facts from. If one doesn't have the facts, one could at least have an opinion and be funny about it. Churchill is neither.I bought it thinking it would be a good introduction to American history written by a great man (I am still a fan of his speeches), but this is not the right book. I don't know why it even got published - its edited form should already have given me a clue that the whole unabridged work was unreadable."
2,Showing neglected and abused cat's = no!,I was hoping for a nice video on wildcats. Instead it's got images totally depressing and inappropriate for kids in my opinion. I don't want to watch the horrors people do wild animals. And it shows too many people as well. Growing up Wild Cat's title is misleading.
2,A Loud Hummer!,"I had this radio for less than 24hrs. and sent it back. First of all the radio has an annoying hum when turned off. I prefer a quiet bedroom so I had to pull the plug to fall asleep. Secondly, the first morning I woke up the volume control stopped working. I was able to turn up the volume...but not down. Also, the preset button functions are not sensitive enough. You have to press hard to get results. Finally, the AM/PM & AM/FM digital display is blurry. You have to be on top of it to read it. I replaced an older clock radio with this unit and I'm now back to the old unit which cost about a 1/3 less. Disapointed, is the word to describe this radio."
1,Not what expected,"This item is made of tough rubber and cannot be fitted over the steering wheel until ""very warm"", currently impossible as it is the middle of winter. I also didn't like that Mickey appears upside down on one of the sides. This may end up in the donation bin."
4,"Step by step, one by one...","Following The Way It Is, Bruce and co. could have stuck to the same formula and tried to stay on the charts doing the same thing over again. Thankfully they're better than that. While Scenes from the Southside has some of the same elements - rustic country tinges, real-life stories in the lyrics, fantastic piano - it takes them several steps further. Check the dreamy ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Till the Dreaming's Done."" Listen to Bruce paint pictures with his words in ""Road Not Taken."" There's also possibly the finest Hornsby song no one's heard of: ""The Show Goes On."" Seven minutes of beauty that leaves you wanting more.Take a look at the back cover picture, a bridge somewhere in Virginia surrounded by woods in a blaze of autumn orange, and you'll get an idea of just what mood this album fits in. A step beyond The Way It Is and an excellent indicator of what was to come, this album is just as indispensable."
1,Inaccurate description.,"#45-240 measures 5/16""(8mm) wide. A 'narrow' refill is 1/4""(6mm) wide. #45-240 won't fit a narrow claw holder which is the width I need."
1,Wish I Had Seen the Amazon.com Rating,"I wish I had seen the bad reviews on Amazon.com before I bought this book from a hotel convenience store. The parts of the book are labeled ""A Matter of Integrity,"" ""The Value of Truth,"" and ""A Question of Trust"". It sounds like she is aiming high, but she addresses every one of these themes in a worn-out, shallow way. But she never fails to describe what the narrator is wearing. A subplot about a helpless French girl escaping from her violent husband never adds to the story, and ends anticlimactically. Meanwhile, the narrator goes on and on about how she was victimized by her mother, without ever telling us anything that would really make us feel sympathy for her."
1,Excruciatingly slow-moving and boring beyond belief!,"I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list. Well, it never did! It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point. The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens. The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc. Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure!"
2,A Welcome Change of Pace,I found this book to be a welcome change to what I usually read. I read her first book A Woman of Substance and I loved it. I think that Mrs. Bradford keeps trying to rekindle the spark of that first novel and never has made it back there. It was an easy read. I think the most interesting aspect of the novel is that Valentine was a confused woman and she had to face her problems head on and ending up becoming a better woman for it. She faced her mother head on and found out the lies her lover told her. Then comes in Jake. Wonderful and sweet Jake. We wish all men were this considerate and gentle. I also liked how she reconciled with her brother after 8 years of not talking or seeing him.
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOring,"Awful! Money down the drain! I was not impressed at all by this book. The main character was very shallow. The plot was very repetitive and with no point. It seems that the author didn't know how to develop the story, instead she just kept repeating many times how the character was mistreated by her mother...I felt no compassion for the heroin. As for the love story , it was very unreal without any emotion whatsoever. Basically, there was really no point ot this story..I just read it for the sake of reading it and putting it away, once I had started. Definatly, a very pointless read!"
5,Babies love the puppet!,"This the first book that got my daughter's attention at 6 months! She has many toys and books, but the penguin puppet is hard for her to resist. The book is fun and and the puppet helps children interact and it holds their attention!"
5,Penguin book,This was a great children's book and was the right price for me. Shipped quickly and I was very pleased with my purchase.
4,of Chicken Sunday,I think Chicken Sunday is a good book because they had made chicken every Sunday and thats what my Mom does sometimes. I think people would like to read this book if they like chicken. I would give this book a four because it was interesting reading it. I would want to read more books written by Patricia Palacco. I would recommend this book to my friends.
2,Beyond Beginner,"The concept is great.However, for an english speaking child coming into this at ground zero, it does not seem likely that this approach will be successful based on initial use."
5,Right on time,"I am a great fan of Timex. Have been for years. This watch is another solid product. An excellent value and highly recommended. Mine arrived on time, set with the correct time and date. Excellent Amazon service."
5,Pain That I'm Used To,"Pain That I'm Used To~ Depeche Mode is a single that sounds like Depeche Mode took inspiration from a plethora of bands such as Skinny Puppy, Nitzer Ebb and a bit from Frontline Assembly. The guitar sound used on this track sounds allot like the guitar sound that Skinny Puupy uses on their albums. As for the Nitzer Ebb connection that is the drum sound and the keyboard sounds sound like they borrowed quite heavily from both Skinny Puppy and Fronline Assembly. Gahan sounds amazing and the lyrics are stupendous as always without being to obtuse or convuluted. This single gets 5 ouf of 5 and shows that Depeche Mode is truly a band for the ages."
1,BORING BEYOND BELIEF,"WHATEVER OTHERS MAY THINK OF HIS MUSICAL TALENT, TO MY EARS BARRUECOS MUST BE THE MOST BORING GUITARRIST IN THE WORLD. NO MUSICAL PALETTE, NO FLAIR, TOTALLY ANEMIC. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THREE OF HIS RECORDS, 2 PIAZZOLAS AND CUBA. RECYCLED OLD HORSES, I AM ONLY KEEPING ONE AND TWO ARE GOING FOR XMAS GIFTS TO PEOPLE I DO NOT LIKE VERY MUCH. HOWEVER, THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE: THE BEST SLEEPING AID THIS SIDE OF MARTINIS!"
4,Nice,"Very intricate writing. Creative music played by gifted players. Andy plays great, full of feeling , not to show off his impressive technique.Just wish I could have heard Chris Rogers blow some solos on trumpet."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I'd read some reviews before reading this ""novel"", and I thought I was prepared for the sparse style Duras employed, but that did not turn out to be the case; I found her writing style annoying and distracting. It was like reading some rough draft that was never intended to be read by anyone else other than the author herself. It did not draw me in at all, and I found myself skimming and glossing over a lot of what she wrote. To me, this book could barely even be called a novel; it was more like a sketch than a portrait. It's rare to enjoy a movie more than a book, but in this case I much preferred the film ""The Lover"" to the book, ""The North China Lover"". (The book did seem to pick up steam and had a more ""novel-like"" tone after around 100 pages or so, and from that point on I did enjoy it. But overall this book was very disappointing for me.)"
2,Poor reliability,"The router works great when it works, but there seems to be some design problem with the soft-start switch or circuitry. Mine died after less than 8 hours of use. I opened it up and cleaned the dust out of the switch, which gave me another 2 hours of use before it died again. Cleaning didn't fix it, so I took it in for repair, which Milwaukee paid for. The guy at the shop told me it was a common problem with this model.Since being repaired, I've used it maybe 15-20 hours, and now it's died again (same problem with the switch). I don't know if Milwaukee will pay to fix it again, but even if they do, it takes a week to get it fixed. I don't use a router that often, but when I need one it doesn't do much good not to have it until a week later."
3,A Better Quatology(?) than Octology(?),"I could not agree more with 'A Reader from NY USA' & 'Plot Fatigue' reviews of this series. This would have been a masteful four volume series. Lady Dunnett's style is so exacting that you have to read 'every' word otherwise you miss clues to the story. As a result, you can get easily bored. I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Nichols de Fleury but it was a bit much."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is a study guide that is 100% worthless unless you are using it with the associated text book. Don't buy it as a stand-alone work. It doesn't even have an index.Instead check out ""Lifespan Human Development"" by Gormly and Brodzinsky instead. It has a high Amazon rating and it seems well written, concise, and on topic.I was also very happy with the vendor, College Book Service. They let me upgrade the shipping on my order so it would arrive sooner,..."
4,Felt Like A Kid Again!,"I just ordered this the other day,as I thought that I would get it for the grandchildren.It was such a great price that I would not pass it up!I opened the box and could smell the candy before I even opened it! I had to take the plastic off the lid,just to see what kind was included.I started eating just one,then it was two..I feel like a kid again~sneaking candy at night.No problems with my Laffy Taffy at all."
1,"Free, but don't waste your time","Beginning of the book as of October 22, 2010 says,""This text includes characters that require UTF-8 (Unicode) file encoding:""Then the characters are displayed as question marks and it goes on to say that you may have an incompatible browser or unavailable fonts. Curious I switched all the fonts available on my Kindle (latest generation, 3g + wifi)and none of them changes the question marks into anything else but question marks.Amazon, please address this issue!As a result, the book is pretty useless."
3,"Useful Dictionary, Difficult Formatting","First off, this review is for the hardcopy paperback, not the (now unavailable) electronic version. I was disappointed with this dictionary. Although it has an enormous number of entries, including etymologies, it is a bit of a pain to use because the layout is a bit messy and the publisher didn't use the several special characters required by Middle English. This doesn't render the dictionary unusable by any means, just not as user-friendly. Still, for the price, and considering the limited options for ME dictionaries, this is worth having around."
4,Not Easy! In a good way,This work out DVD is engaging & entertaining. I broke a good sweat and really felt the burn on the majority of the moves. It was more challenging than I expected & Kim was realistic and added commentary that I was thinking at time when the workout was tough.I gave it 4 stars because they (Kim & her trainer) would at times quickly transition from move to move without giving the viewer the proper guidance or description on how the move should be being done. This could present a problem to viewers the 1st couple times they do the video & to viewers that aren't advanced.
4,"She's no genius, but the workout is alright","Kim does not direct the workout herself, not by a long shot, so I had to take a star away for that alone. Her trainer does it, and Kim is on there just working out with her as she would if they were just working out for her. Kim doesn't always have the precise pose which makes working out to this DVD (with her) more realistic because she isn't perfect, just like her viewers. For this reason, it was sort of motivating, especially since her curves look realistic. She is ditzy, never really heard her talk much until then because I don't watch the show nor am I a fan, but she is my height and I am a woman with curves so I wanted to see how she got down. I was sore for days after my first workout. It seems so simple doing it, but it works the right muscles and does the job. Great gig Kim is all I can say."
4,Definite Burn,"I love this DVD because it really is a great workout and I notice in the mirror a more bigger, fit , toned butt and legs. Definitely Kim K giving out her secrets. I use it twice a week and rotate with other dvds. This workout is meant for a women to tone and keep her curves, even create some ;) . I reccomend to all ladies"
3,Good but bad camera angles,"I bought this DVD because I've worked out to one of her other DVD's and really liked. Yes it's irritating that she doesn't sweat or her hair isn't out of place, but if you honestly thought Kim Kardashian would let you see her look like a hot mess, then you are living in a fantasy world. I thought this was a descent workout and I did get a good workout, my only complaint is the shots of the camera. They are so focused on Kim's face that you miss the steps until they are on the 3rd step or so. I wish they would have focused more on the steps, form and transition instead of showing how cute Kim is. And before you buy any of her DVDs be sure to buy a step. I didn't know I needed one so it's hard to do some of the moves without the step."
2,boring and slow,Maybe its just me but I found the workout to be very boring and very slow. It wasn't cohesive. Actually I wasn't even sweating when I finished. I hate when I finish a workout and afterwards I don't feel as if I did anything. I'm sure if Kim would have shut up more and just went from one exercise to the next in a quicker manner perhaps it would have been more effective but the pauses were long and it just didn't do it for me.
5,Ireland!,"If you don't have any Irish in you when you start this book, you will by the time you've finished it!Scarlet Feather is a fledgling catering company in Dublin, run by Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather, who met in cooking school. The book follows the first year of the company, with intriguing insights into how it's all done.The book also follows the same year in the lives of the delightful, eccentric, maddening group of family, friends, spouses, and significant others who move in Cathy and Tom's orbit.The dialogue sings with the cadence of the English language as it's spoken in Ireland--no dialect, just a rhythm in the way the words are put together, with a few turns of phrase, all like soft music in the background.This was only my second reading of this book, and now I know why I kept it. It's going right back on my keeper shelf."
2,Boring boring boring,I've read two other books of Maeve Binchy - Tara Road and Circle of Friends. I liked Tara Road a lot even though it didn't get to the point till over halfway through. Circle of Friends was just tolerable. I wanted to give Scarlet Feather a chance since it was newer like Tara Road. It was waste of time. The most interesting parts of this book were the scenes with Cathy and Neil. I'm so glad to be done with this book and on to something else. I've purchased other Maeve Binchy books because I thought I'd like them based on a friend but I think I am going to sell them back. Her books are too long and boring!
5,Another nice book,I really have to like a book or else I put it down and stop reading. This kept me interested. Very sweet story!
2,Scarlet feather: not MY personal favorite...,"Do the main characters in Maeve Binchy books always get divorced? After Tara Road, I was told this was her best... I'm sorry to say that if this is her best, it's my last! Personally, I don't like reading through a long book to find an unhappy ending... I like to see characters building positive, happy lives for themselves..."
1,Don't waste your money or your time....,"I finally just stopped reading this book. I have read most of Binchy's books and have loved them all, especially Tara Road. I thought her writing was getting better with every book. What happened? The book is poorly written and just plain BORING!!!!!!!!!!!! I read about 150 pages and finally decided that I could not waste any more time on this snoozer. The characters are drawn like caricatures rather than believable people as had been done in her many marvelous books. I'm terribly disappointed as is our book club for picking this dud."
2,a real bore,What happened to Maeve Binchy? Her latest book does not compare with her others and I cannot reccomend it as a good read.
2,Very disappointed...,"I never thought I'd see the day when I wouldn't enjoy a Binchy book! My opinion on Tara Road wasn't favourable, but hoped that it was a one-off. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Scarlet Feather is written in much the same way as Tara Road - he said, she said, he went, she went....ad nauseaum. What happened to the depth of character and storylines for which Binchy is so famous? I could never put her books down, now I can't put them down fast enough. I really, really tried to like this one - but after the first 100 or so pages, I just gave a big sigh and put it down for good! Is this what happens when a well-known author is held for ransom by their publisher to get something in print every year? Please Maeve - bring back the good old days!"
4,Charming tale from a master's pen,"Although SCARLET FEATHER isn't my favorite of Maeve Binchy's books (and I've read them all), it's still pretty darned good. I love her quirky characters and the way she always manages to get to the heart of what's important in life. It's obvious that Binchy understands people. She also likes people. And these two traits come across in her writing. I only wish she wrote faster, because it's far too long between books. And I heard a nasty rumor that SCARLET FEATHER might be her last book. Say it isn't so!"
4,Good. Helpful. Compelling-ish.,"The parable of the software company in crisis was not the most thrilling read in the world, but considering it was means toward teaching me about the exciting world of corporate meetings, it was both effective and not boring.This approach is like Mr. Miagi for corporations, ""Wax on. Wax off."" Lather. Rinse. Repeat. If you can hook the reader at the beginning of the story, they'll stick with it and learn something. If they're already motivated to learn, all the better.Advocating more meetings risks melvins, pink bellies, and even the dreaded rear admiral from the other kids in the office, but it seems like a good plan. I may even test it out at my company, where going to a meeting is the work equivalent of watching paint dry--while someone drives a railroad spike into your brain."
1,Death by book,"Terrible. With so many good, REAL stories out there, how could there ever be a market for a 'fable'? I should have read the fine print. This is not a true story, but instead, a made-up mess. Yuck."
1,An incredible disappointment.,"As a tremendous fan of Sanchez's previous books (""Mile Zero"" is one of the best novels I've ever read), I was stunned by how bad this book is. This novel is incredibly overwrought and overwritten; at some points you feel like the author may be trying to parody the historical romance genre. While the plot is a strong one (there are some similarities to ""Corelli's Mandolin) and the idea of a Picasso-like painter and his mistress seems as if it would work well, Sanchez can't pull it off (despite trying hard... painfully so). Perhaps this was his attempt to write something that might become an ""English Patient"" type film... as someone who really admires the author's previous work, I can only hope that ""Day of the Bees"" is an aberration."
5,"The authority book, against which you will compare all the others","I was surprised at the few naysayer reviews but opinions differ. In my experience (I have only about a dozen WW1-WW2 naval books which is not an immense library) this book and the WW1 equivalent are clearly the most comprehensive technical references. All the other books I have sometimes add detail but the center of all my books are easily the Janes. If you buy no other technical naval books of the period, it will be this one."
4,"very detailed book with great pictures, and superb analysis",Everything i ever wanted to know about ships...goes along the lines of other janes titles. Despite the steep price it is worth the money for Naval warfare enthusiasts.END
2,Below the Jane's standard!!,"I was searching for a reference book about ALL the warships involved in the Second World War and belonging to EVERY nation (a too ambitious demand?); I saw the title ""Jane's..."", read a customer's comment and decided to buy this book. When I received it I felt a little disappointed, because the book wasn't exactly what it seemed to be. Maybe it can have a value as an historical document, being the reprint of past Jane's editions (of wartime); but as such it cannot have what I instead expected to find, such as data about the war losses, the war construction (some navies are almost complete, some other expecially the Axis ones are not), and so on. It seems to be more an editorial operation than a true historical book about the argument; surely below the usual standard of the other Jane's books. BTW: about one year after I bought the ""Conway's all the world's fighting ships 1922-1946"", and there I found what I was looking for."
4,Both Camps are Correct,"Originally I would have given this book a 5 stars & attacked the critics, but they have their point. This book is a Jane's circa. 1946 and has errors in it. Jane's are 'realtime' publications & of course have errors; it even says that in the Foreward of this book. However, the title is VERY misleading, lending one to think that it is the 'definitive' resource for all WW2 ships. You need a Conway's for that. Shame on the marketing department for that one. But for a period publication showing what was known at THAT time, it is excellent. The proper title of this book should be: ""Jane's Fighting Ships, 1946 - 1947"" end of story. Shame on Jane."
1,Assorted Tubes,"The delivered small bag of scrap cut-offs did not match 1/4 of the size or quantity of the picture. The actual tubes were mostly 1/2"" and less in length making this product garbage and not useable for any purpose. Disappointed."
2,Heavy little guy who makes calls by itself,"My husband and I bought two of these with a shared plan. Even though we're sharing minutes, we do not get any discount for calling each other, in fact, we get charged on both ends and we constantly get bad reception. (One of us usually hangs up and we call each other on my Siemens phone.) This phone is VERY heavy compared to every other cell phone I've ever tried. I also don't like the fact that there's no cover for it. I keep it either in my purse or in my coat pocket and it frequently dials numbers by itself with the slightest bump or touch from something... which adds to my phone bill."
1,"TURNS OFF, PIECE OF JUNK","This is my 2nd 2260. The first one kept turning off with no warning brand spanking new out of the box. I returned it with a $14 mailing charge, and now the replacement phone - 5 days old_ is giving me double letters on the screen, misssing letters, and then turnes off as I tries to answer it. It is a piece of junk. THANKS A LOT AT & T."
1,Dead in 24 hours,"I bought this phone with a prepaid plan from hsn.com. When I received it, it looked cheap and flimsy, but I thought ""hey, it is a Nokia"". I charged it for 24 hrs as recomended, then.. it just died. I am returning today. I am surprised Nokia put out such a poor performance item. It is a real trap, don't buy it!!"
4,A great way to serve oysters and shrimp,We do not use this for its intended purpose. We bake oysters and shrimp in the cups with seasons to serve as appetizers . The recipe can be found in a magazine names Mobile Bay Monthly( October or November 2012) addition.
4,Love the look,i love the look of my seat covers! A cheerful and colorful way to personalize my seats. Plus they help protect the seats from spills. the only drawback is they were a little more difficult to install on my Jeep seats. It took two of us to put them on.
1,not work very well,i did not necessary to buy it .I did not work very well.only a wire turn arrond the jack do the same job
1,Grundig Radios Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this for my Grundig shortwave radio, the antenna did virtually nothing on improving my (shortwave) reception. I'm assuming this product is for Sangean radios only."
2,"Well made, but doesn't enhance SW reception.","It was worth a shot for the price. But this antenna extension doesn't seem to pull in SW signals any better than the telescoping antenna on my Realistic (Tandy) DX-370 alone, at least when strung indoors. The product is well-made however. This antenna extension might work better with different SW frequencies than the ones on the DX-370 (3.2-7.3 MHz and 9.5-21.75 MHz)."
3,Best thing out there?,Bought this to go with my Grundig shortwave Radio. It is effective in the FM and 40m broadcast bands. Only wish there was a storage compartment within the wind up case to hold the telescoping aerial adapter so it wouldn't get lost. At this price buy 2 and have a backup.
5,This is supposed to be in the ATS-909X box!!! Not sold seperately,"This antenna comes with the ATS-909x radio. You do not need to order it, unless you lose the antenna included in the box. This improves the reception dramatically on SW. It doesn't improve standard commercial a.m. reception very much, except at night. The ATS-909X radio comes with this antenna AND the carrying case for the radio itself. The antenna itself is outstanding for its size! Very compact, rolls out and in very easily... just use the ""shuttle"" style knob to reel it back in! It DOES improve the received signal considerably compared to the ""ship"" antenna. It DOES plug directly into the ATS-909X antenna jack."
4,Lewis Black rocks!,"For those of you who don't mind the 'F' word at least 42 times, this is a great DVD. He is very poignant and right on with his topical subjects, both political and religous. He goes where few comedians dare to go. Some of the bits are flat out hysterical."
1,One star,"Great pictures (for black and white), including of the tombs of some of the great Chinese Muslim saints; but regarding content the author displays very little interest/appreciation for the religion of Islam; he presents a book that is quite ""fuzzy around the edges,"" with very little regard for the vast wealth of Islamic/Sufi tradition in China, including the Naqshbandiyya (Khuffiyya/Jahriyya) and Qadiriyya orders. One would wish to see in a book like this much more probing and intelligent representation of these truely fascinating people, the Hui Muslims."
5,perfect!,"this book was the best work of short fantasy that i read. it had all of the traits of a great epic fantasy with none of the length. Britain did a wonderful job on her debut novel, and i commend her for her work."
4,"Slow beginning, but gets better fast","The first about 3/4 of the book, while good, were not captivating. (As another reviewer pointed out, I kept thinking of M. Lackey's Heralds of Valdemar series.) Then all of a suddent the real action started and I couldn't put the book down.I am really looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
3,An ok book,"'The Green Rider' has the potential to be a really great story line, but Kristen Britain just didn't cut it. when I first read the book the first thing I noticed was that Ms. Britain went from diaster to disaster. Normaly I would have rated a book like this a one but I found that the author drew me into the book with her style of writing."
