2,Nothing special,"I have been using this for several weeks and I find it comparable to Neutrogena acne treatments I can purchase at Wal-Mart. It really dries my face out, so I have to use it sparingly. I wish I hadn't fell for the hype!"
2,"Sentiment, stock characters, and syrup","Fortunately for curious readers, this book is in the public domain. Sample it before buying. With a predictable plot and a cast of stock characters, The Return of the Soldier best resembles a Hallmark movie. A damaged man, a woman's love, the constraints and snobbery of class, the power of fatherhood and memory...all attractive themes but never getting beyond the depth or stuff of light historical fiction for the sentimental. I would recommend it as part of a larger study on fictional responses to post-WWI but not on its own merits."
5,Especially relevant to the 2000 workplace.,"Every chapter provided excellent background, information and guidance - plan to order a dozen for a management study team."
3,Thorough but long-winded,"This book is designed to help you improve your ability to interact with others through everyday conversations. The author identifies six ""talk- tools"":Disclosures,Reflections,Interpretations,Advisements, Questions, and Silences. He devotes a chapter to each tool, and follows with a chapter on how to improve your use of each one. The book has over 200 densely printed pages, complete with research references, extended samples of recorded conversations and much discussion of possible variations. The length and completeness of the book works against its usefulness as a practical guide, especially compared to Laurie Kuhn's wonderful book Instant Persuasion on the same subject. Although Kuhn's book is short and simple (e.g., regarding Advisement she simply says ""Don't give unsolicited advice"") compared to Goodman's treatise, it is much easier to remember and apply."
4,Beautiful and sturdy,We got this crib through babies r'us and got the shipment within a week of ordering. We found it to be pretty easy to put together. It was especially nice that there wasn't 1000 pieces that had to be assembled. The only small problem we came across was putting the spring metal piece in. We at first put it in upside down but it was an easy fix. The only current problem I'm having now is the mobile I bought does not fit to the frame. Does anybody have any suggestions to fix this problem?
4,Great crib,"I did not buy the dark pine, I bought the honey oak and I love it! The crib is very sturdy, easy to put together (I did it in a matter of maybe 30 minutes in my 3rd trimester). It is a bit difficult to tie the corners of our crib bumpers but we won't be using them once the baby is out of his bassinet anyway. Our mobile fit just fine. I think it just looks beautiful. We also bought the matching dresser and that is very nice too. What I don't like is that the color is really hard to match. I have been looking for a book case that will match closely to the color and haven't been able to find one. This is well worth the money."
4,"Love it, but...","I just got this crib, but the drop down side version. I couldn't find it listed on the Babies-R-Us website. I love it but as many have said the wood is very soft. I have the Froggy Tales Mobile and it attaches fine, but to the side of the crib not the end. My biggest issue is how to attach the bumper to the side without interfering with the drop down side. We also bought the matching changing table and now there is a matching chest of drawers which also isn't pictured on the site. The whole set is absolutely lovely and goes beautifully with my nursery's yellow walls.Not sure what to do about the teething issue."
1,The worse acting ever,"Nothing more to say. The absolute worse acting ever! I swear, one women on the third movie, Vicious Kiss, looks like someone who use to be someone famous but she was as terrible as the rest of each cast."
5,Goddard is a great author,I haven't read this one yet. I have about 30 of Goddard's books and I ordered this one to add to my collection of his work. He's in the top five British authors for me. His work won't disappoint you.
2,Another tiresome autobiography from a psychic of sorts,"While I found the few bits on future life progressions interesting and confirming of other things I've read, that could have been covered in a magazine article. Overall, it is just another autobiography, badly in need of a good editor to bring some fluiditiy. While I'm sure she finds it fascinating (it's her life--she should!), I found it a rather dull read. You might find it interesting and satisfying if you are very new to reincarnation and the paranormal. Otherwise, save your money."
2,Boring and tiresome rehash on reincarnation,"Nothing new here. The author basically rehashes other works on reincarnation and imparts very little new information. I found the book hard to follow as she jumps from here to there and the story of her ""future life"" visions do not ring true."
4,Pretty good workout,"I am an advanced stepper, so I didn't have too much trouble with the moves. I found them fun and liked her choreography. The time does fly by and it is very ""dancy"" which is what I wanted. I have other DVD's that were MUCH more difficult to get the hang of.Unfort. the workout isn't as hard as I wanted. I sweat- but was hoping for something more intense. I do have other DVD's for that though and will continue to use this DVD when I want to take it down a notch. I could also power-up more of her moves or modify.Abs section wasn't bad- quick, but worth doing.It would be nice if she had a better warm up- I wouldn't even call what she does a warm up.I have only watched this DVD a few times and her singing the queues is KILLING ME. It's driving me nuts. Hopefully I can memorize her routine at some point and turn the volume off!Overall I'd recommend this to an advanced stepper looking for fun/dancey choreography."
2,Maybe we can't go home again after all.,"If you remember and treasure the music of Glenn from the 60's, keep those memories intact and skip this album. If this were a collection of Glenn's greatest hits, it would be a wonderful find, but it isn't and it isn't. The songs are poorly, almost amateurishly arranged and the background instrumentals uninspired. There are a few cuts where Glenn's wonderful voice and styling overcomes the other limitations, but generally even he can't save this poor presentation. I was delighted tonight to find that The Lonely Things is available on CD. I plan to order that to replace my worn-out vinyl album. I recommend that others do the same."
2,Warning! Re-Recordings!!,"This is not a bad album, mind you, but be warned...These are NOT the original ""Bucks Fizz"" recordings! This is one of the newer off-shoots of Bucks Fizz, fronted by original member Mike Nolan and David Van Day (of ""Dollar"" fame), along with two girl singers. The instrumentation is not as full as the original recordings, but they do a good job in invoking the original vocals, though they are a bit thin on harmonies and overdubs. A couple of new tracks make this album stand-out, for if you want to hear the original Bucks Fizz sound, look elsewhere..."
4,Good depth and breadth,"This is a good overall book that goes beyond your basic linear algebra texts such as Leon. If you're on the fence about buying it, just google Carl Meyer. His website has a digital copy of the text, so you can check it out and decide if it's worth buying. I commend the author for making the digital copies available, which is uncommon for an author to do. So if you find the text useful, please buy it!Oh, by the way, the textbook includes a cd with searchable pdf copies of the book and solutions manual. That alone sets this text apart from most others."
5,Excelent book!,"This is probably the best book to learn linear algebra from. The exposition is very clear and it has many insightful exercises. In my opinion, it contains everything that should be covered in an introductory course."
1,Poorly written,"This novel was poorly written, there was little to no chance to get to know the characters, to develop feelings for them... I usually enjoy YA novels,but this book did not impress me in anyway."
5,Everywhere Babies,"This is a wonderful book! It is very inclusive with many different types of families. Also, my daughter loved this book as a small baby and still loves to read it as a 4-year old. As she went through the different developmental milestones as a baby and young toddler, I liked to point out the things that she could do now that she couldn't do before (crawling, talking, walking, etc.). This is a real favorite of mine (along with anything by Mo Willems ""and Tango Makes Three"")."
5,My favorite baby book,"Of all of the books that my son owns, this one is my favorite. The pictures are so cute and detailed. We notice something new everytime we read it. For the first few months of reading this book, I couldn't read the last 3 pages without choking up because it is so sweet. I find it interesting that people are offended by the same-sex couples. I didn't even notice them until we had owned the book for a year, and even then, it just made me like the book even more. My son is growing up in a diverse world, and I think it's good for him to be exposed to this diversity from the start. That way, when he encounters such diversity, it might not seem different to him at all. Besides, babies are born completely open-minded; it's their parents who close their minds for them!"
1,not for my conservative family,"The pictures are cute, the text is sweet, but the book pictures several same-sex couples, which I don't think is appropriate for such young children, at least not for mine. There needs to be some note to the book that informs that the book has pictures of the alternative families."
5,great baby gift,"My son and I both adore this book - the text is engaging for little ones, the illustrations are adorable, and they show a diverse group of families (multi-racial, lesbian moms, etc)."
5,Guess what? This is the best record of all time.,"10 songs. Robert Plant wailing whole lotta love over an underwater air-raid siren? check. Breath-of-fresh-air indie with tunes? check. Acoustic melt-your-heart lofi? check. Spacy drone-rock from the planet XOF3332? check. A reinterpretation of John Coltrane's Naima with added junk shop sounds? check. Lime Kiln, one of the best, weirdest songs you will hear? check. Other stuff too? yes. Are you going to buy this?"
5,Nastalgic,"Anyone that lived in the early 70's, can get nastalgic and remember the ""good ol' days"".......I recommend this for anyone that saw it then...and would like to remember some of the old times.....toke & enjoy!"
2,A Poor Sequel to a Great Cartoon,"This is a poor sequel to a great cartoon (Fritz The Cat). I didn't enjoy it when released and like it even less now. The story drags along with little to keep your attention, if it were on TV you would channel surf. Seems to me it was an attempt to squeeze more dollars out of an idea that had already ran it's course in the first film."
2,eh I just couldn't enjoy it,"I really just could not enjoy this one..and I really wanted to having enjoyed the first film so much. First it's alot more tame than the original , and by today's standards it's very tame. And it's just plain boring. The first one may have dragged in certain spots but it still kept you entertained , this one just drags and drags , and is just boring as Fritz sits around on welfare , smokes pot , ignores his nagging wife , and daydreams some rediculous situations that aren't entertaining or raunchy. Skip it"
1,Emotional Exploitation,"This film panders to morbid sexual and substance abuse curiosity by creating a series of disjointed nihilistic encounters between characters. What's worse is the the negative stereotype development of all the characters is focused on an urban environment that has the danger of bleeding out into a negative subconscious stereotype of urban environments in real life. Unless the characters are based on real life, in which case this should be shown and discussed in an academic environment."
3,Strange movie,"Strange and psychedelic images interspersed with 70's funk and a lot of weed, it has it's good moments. But... This movie may offend the sensibilities of some folks. Only buy it if you want to see drug and sex comedy as voiced by one of the guys most famous for his role in the 1970's version of The Electric Company."
3,Worked good for brass eagle i thought. Until!!!!! lol,"This gun belonged to a buddies dad of mine who painballed with us and seemed like a pretty solid little gun fired okay fairly accurate. ive seen him hit a good number of people and win games against others who had tippman A-5'S and spyders etc guns of that caliber. I decided to fire this gun and did so but then acting funny i turned the gun to fire it sideways and in doing so the quickstrip pen fell out and the gun fell to pieces, so finally i say its a decent gun good enough to play around most local fields but be aware of the pin falling out under rapid fire or showboat shooting lol"
3,decent starter gun,"First off i would like to say that I would not give more than 50 dollars for this gun. This gun eats co2 and doesn't shoot very accuratly. Like i said in the title this gun is ok for a young starter player, but don't expect this gun to last very long; especially in the hands of a young player who doesn't know how to properly lube the internal parts correctly. Not a necisarilly a bad gun, but i just didn't like my experience with this gun."
5,Great history,"I enjoyed this book, which is very well documented with lots of footnoes and bibliography. The Nazis come off looking pretty arrogant about Spain, which they thought was at their beck and call. This book has everything a good history should: adventure, war, diplomacy, economics, conspiracies, and unexpected results. Excellent."
2,Doughty and ugly,I buy jockey and was looking for a cheaper three-pack. I couldn't find what I wanted so chose these. One had polka dots and the waist is too high. I don't want the man in life to see me in these. Ugh. The quality is okay.
2,Not what I expected.,I thought I was getting the Elance Supersoft....didn't realize there was an Elance cotton. These run smaller and are not as comfortable. Would not buy again. Elance Supersoft fit and feel much better.
4,wallpapering my tail,"It's as advertised, inexpensive underwear. The plain colors are okay. I bought the ""geometric patterns"" one too, and what I want to know is, who comes up with these patterns, anyway? They fit, they're cotton, they're comfortable. But I am 47 and don't really feel a need to wear weird colors, perky patterns, or pretty flowers under my clothes. I would love to just be able to buy the colors I want in the size I want in the fabric I want, but I don't want to pay $15 apiece to do that. So, I don't get everything I want. They're inexpensive and convenient to buy. The covered waistbands are nice."
3,"Nice for the price, but it smells.","This mount has multiple ways to mount an external flash/video light and an extra mic. My only complaint would be that the rubber handle smells like rubber. After using it, your hands smell like that too. But, for $10 I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Simple but good enough to underantand!,"I do not say this book has amzing insights for technology management. But its easy to understand what the author say and this book provides student with broad but fundament contents for technological innovation. Overall, good introductionary book for the field of management of technology"
1,Cheap Junk,I got this as a gift and it stinks. The cheap thing gave out in no time and now it doesn't work at all. Buy a Sony brand instead because it will be worth the price.
5,excellent product,I purchased this for my PS3 and XBOX 360. Both game systems seem to get rather warm if operated for a long period. Especially the PS3. They fit well under the system and cool fine. It is much much better than the products sold at game stores and electronic outlets. Looks great too. Being USB powered is a big plus. Worth the price. Not bulky and much quieter. The noise of the others really distracted me and I admit sometimes irritating.Note: Sony and Microsoft had serious problems with systems overheating. Many became inoperative after overheating. This was on the previous models. I think the extra insurance is necessary because of the very high cost of these systems.
2,Do not recommend this product.,"I've had this laptop cooler for about a year now. It's not very good quality. The usb cable is very short and does not reach my laptop's ports, so I had flip it around backwards."
3,Decent Product,"I bought this as a laptop cooler for my 17"" wide-screen Toshiba Satellite.Pros: It is quiet, cools well.Cons: It doesn't work well for 17"" laptops, it's not wide enough. The rubber plugs that separate the unit from the laptop do not stay secured and always fall out. Mine stopped working after 2 years of daily use. If dust accumulates, the fans start to make a lot of noise.Worth what you pay for, but with daily use don't expect it to last more than a year or two."
2,Not Good for a MacBook,"This product has a big flaw when using with a MacBook laptop. The USB cable has a weird design that conflicts with the MacBook power cord connection. Your cannot use both at the same time on the left side of your Mac. This forces you to put the product's USB connection on the right side of your Mac, which in turn forces you to put a USB connected mouse on the left. Putting your mouse on the left is not good for right handed users since it can shorten your mouse cord length. The product would also be better if it clamped onto your laptop so you could lay on your back, with your knees bent, without your laptop sliding off the product. The product has been designed for putting on a desk or table, not kicking back and lounging."
3,does a good job at cooling but could have been better,"Pros:-keeps notebook coolCons:-No power button and does not turn off when the computer is in ""sleep"" mode-Somewhat loud even at the low setting-The USB plug has a USB input but it takes force to connect/disconnect usb cables-Really bright LED light (Covered with electrical tape)Overall this product does a good job at cooling but could have been made better."
4,"Great, but makes a little noise",Good but makes a little noise. I guess that is expected with any fan.
3,"Nice laptop cooler, weak connector","I've had the cooler for a week now and so far so good.Pros:Quiet, cool blue light, appears to force some hot air out of the laptop and vents to the side so it can be balanced on a lap if needed.Cons:The laptop only balances on four rubber mounts so no real way to connect the two and it will raise the laptop a bit creating an odd angle when typing on a desk.It does use up a USB port.Update:After three months the power port for the USB has loosened up and now a slight pressure is needed to keep the fans going. Not sure how to open it up and repair."
3,Pretty good.,"A bit noisy, and I worry about how much energy it might be sucking. But it does the job. The USB cord goes in with the cord coming out at a right angle, so it won't go into a usb slot if there's another cord adjacent."
4,no need for two speeds,"I prefer the quite operation and cooling power of my old Belkin cooling station. However the support stand broke on it and now it makes a great deal of noise when used. This unit is far sturdier and is pulling its weight, but it simply does not move enough air on low speed so I keep mine on high all the time. I am not sorry I purchased this item. It works! and I use it a great deal."
4,Nice product,I have this cooler about 1 month now. It does cool the laptop considerally. Whisperly quiet. Nice product.
2,Bad design and poor engineering,After 3 months of use the fans started to make a lot of noise. The usb cable with a USB passthru that connects to your computer is very short and cumbersome. I think one would be better off with a newer design from another manufacturer who has done a little more r&d. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Laptop Cooler,"I liked this product, it is very light and easy to carry around. Since I started using it, my laptop has not over heated or turned off."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I have an after market handle that serves as a lift for my computer to allow the bottom of it to breath, but it still doesn't cool it enough, and the fans still come on. So, I thought the Notebook Cooler might do the trick. One of the features that I was excited about were the really quiet fans that are supposed to blow away the heat from the bottom of the computer.Well, the fans aren't quiet, and it doesn't cool off my computer. In fact, the fans were as loud, or louder than my notebook's fans. It also isn't very smart. You have to turn it on and off manually, instead of having a sensor that detects heat. The fans are loud, the internal design is lacking, and it really doesn't cool off the computer that much. In fact, it just blows warm air towards you if you're sitting next to it. About the only thing that's good about this is the aesthetic design. It's cool looking, but not worth your money or your time."
1,Sent defective item,Didn't work when I received it... contacted the seller but no response.Filed a claim for a refund. Seller never made any contact to try and resolve the issue.
5,Nice cooling pad!!!!!,"i bought this about a month ago and i absolutely love it. i have a HP DV9000 17"" wide screen, and on the low setting it keeps it very cool. I would recommend this pad to anyone."
2,Works well until it dies!,"I had this product for about a year, and it worked really well. It kept my laptop cool, and I really enjoyed using it. Then it developed an odd whirring noise that was quite annoying but intermittent. Then it died completely. Now I have a plastic laptop stand sitting on my desk just to add to the decor."
1,Not worth the fifty bucks,Had it about a year and the power cord has become very tempermental and only one fan spins.USB cord is angled thus requiring me to unplug the cooling pad anytime I need to have my CD-ROM drive open.Will ntot be replacing it with an identical unit.
1,what a piece of garbage,this is a real piece of garbage please dont buy this it doesnt evn work at all.beware dont be a sucker and purchase this
2,Just didn't do much,This product simply didn't do much for my computer that raising the back of the laptop up about a half an inch wouldn't accomplish without fans.
2,Disappointment,"This notebook cooler did not do much to cool down my laptop. I am very disappointed with this purchase. The fan was pretty quiet during the first month of having it, but soon it collected a lot of dust and began making loud whirring noises. I would NOT recommend this product!"
1,broken,Broke after a bout 2 months. Fan power port is not connected very well to the circuit board. No return. Now a hunk of junk....thanks for nothing. I suggest finding something else.
3,Check your FANS !!!!!,"I just received my Antec Cooler.Nicely packaged, and attractively designed.HOWEVER, after pugging her in, only one fan was turning.I thought I might have to return it. I looked carefullyat the fans, and found that one fan blade was jammed against thefan housing preventing it from turning. (it's barely visible)The SOLUTION: Take a pen, and gently push the blade down through the hole off the housing. It actually snapped away and began tuning.THIS IS POOR QUALITY CONTROL, NOT BAD DESIGN OR ENGINEERING.Shame on the QC people......This one didn't get tested.It is a good design, functions well, and uses quality fans.Suggestion: Try moving your notebook around on the cooler top if you think it's not cooling well, and run it on HIGH. ALWAYSPS. cool UV light tells you it's on!"
5,The notebook cooler that works as advertised,"I have had this cooler for a couple months now and use with the Toshiba notebook. If anyone know Toshiba notebooks, they run fast and they run hot. This cooler does cool down the notebook bottom considerably. I fully recommend this cooler."
2,Fans stopped working after one month,"This pad looks great and provides good cooling. However, the cooling pad only worked for approximately one month.I use an HP 15.5"" laptop that tends to run hot when the video card is being utilized greatly for movies or games. The laptop runs so hot that it is harming the monitor and I will need to have it replaced.The Altec Laptop Cooling Pad worked great for about one month. It lowered the heat of the laptop considerably. The laptop was no longer hot to the touch and the monitor was not being harmed. However, after one month, the fans worked intermittently and then ceased functioning altogether. The pad was receiving power (the LED light showed that power was being received) and I tried toggling the fan speed between high and low, but nothing.Bottom line: Great laptop cooler for about one month. After that, it will cease functioning."
5,Great way to cool your laptop,I bought this device in hope that my laptop would operate at a lower tempature and this product did the job great!!!!! It helps my laptop run more efficently and helps with typing as well ( by lifting the laptop up another 2-3 inches. I would recommend this product to any person who buys a dell laptop. Great Great product.
2,Works well until breaking,"This product keeps my laptop acceptably cool when it was previously overheating. However, one of the fans died a few days after I received it. I only happen to need the fan on the side that still works, but I'm not very pleased with the quality of this product."
4,Great Product!!!,"This was my first time having the Antec Notebook Cooler, and it was great. If you are distractive from noise this product will fit you well.Antec Inc Notebook Cooler"
1,Dead on Arrival,"This came and I was excited to get my laptop temp., down. Put it into the USB port and wouldn't work at all. The ""Very Bright"" blue LED light was showing so I knew it had power. But when I checked (with a very bright flashlight)by looking right at the fans, they weren't moving one CM. Could not recommend.Went instead to the Targus Lap Chill Mat AWE55US (Black with Gray), which had many good reviews and it works great. Can see, hear (very slightly) but feel the air flowing. Ordered the Targus from Amazon for about $10 more but what else could you do with one that didn't work?"
2,Doesn't go the distance.,I've had two of these. Each one quit working after less than a year. The USB cable's plug-in point in the laptop cooler platform becomes loose and doesn't maintain contact. I would also prefer that the pad not be hard plastic as I use it on my lap and not on a desk.
5,a good cooler,"2 fans , 2 speeds , it's quite and most of all it keeps my machine running cool . i'm going to buy another as a present ."
5,It works,"After we connected it to our laptop, the laptop doesn't shut down by itself due to overheat. The cooler works as we expected."
5,Great cooler,"My son has one of these and loves it.I recently bought one for myself and liked it so well,I bought two more for my wife and daughter."
5,great product,"Bought this cooler for my wife.Great product.Her Asus tablet has been running extremly hot after a year or so of use.To hot for your lap at times.Bought this, laptop is running easily 20 lower.Works great on you lap on the couch as well."
4,Compact & Helpful,"I really like this product. It's a bit small but it doesn't feel awkward on my lap beneath a larger laptop. It tends to lower the temperature anywhere from 5 to 15 degrees celsius, which is pretty good. It's very portable and isn't a pain to move from room to room. The real bonus (and selling point) is that it's quiet. It doesn't distort my voice on a built-in laptop microphone when I'm using it while talking on Skype. It's not at all distracting. Overall, I would definitely recommend this cooler."
3,Antec Notebook cooler,"Product performs well. This is a second purchase for the same brand cooler pad (I had purchased one a few years back and needed a replacement). In terms of value, it seems a bit overpriced for the quality. Also, the product had advertised that the USB connector for the pad would come with an adapter such that you wouldnt lose a USB port on the laptop if the cooling pad was connected. Well, the cord that came with mine had just a regular USB connector, which is a minus for me."
4,Antec: A good buy,"I have a dv6t and due it heats up so much that u can fry an egg :x. After looking at the reviews, I bought nice little antec cooler. It cools throughly & I can use my laptop for hours without worrying about the heat. The cooler is so quiet that if u did not have the blue LED, it would be impossible to realize that the cooler is working. For antec I have to use my oven for frying eggs.For the price I got it, its a great buy"
5,Works much better than previous cooling mat,"This cooling mat works well, it is stable and my laptop sits on it well. There are little knobs to keep the laptop from falling off or moving too much. Those knobs can sometimes pop out but are easily put back in and that usually happens when i pack them in a bag together for transit, not when the laptop is using the mat. The cord is short but has an extra usb port on it which is convenient and there is a little hidden compartment to store the cord when u take the cooling mat somewhere or when storing it while not in use so that the cord does not get lost. Overall good product. I've only had it a couple months but it already has lasted longer than the targus brand cooling mat i purchased previously."
1,LapTop Still OverHeats,I have it on high but my laptop still shuts down so I have to turn a regular fan on it as well.
2,Great...when it works,"At first it did a fine job cooling down my laptop, but after a couple months of use the power cord won't stay connected. My laptop stays at home, so this is not due to mis-handling. The fan will turn on if I fiddle with it, but won't stay on for more than a few seconds. Oh - and the smell right out of the box was atrocious! I had to put the thing outside to air out for a few days before I could use it without getting a headache. I should have sent it back right then. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this piece of junk."
5,In Real Life,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Leslie Sill's previous books on artists, and now her latest book on photographers. They are wonderful outlines of artist's lives, their work, and how their past experiences have influenced the direction of their art. As an art teacher, I try to incorporate different ways of introducing my students to a wide range of work. Because these stories are so well-written and inspiring, I have designed large portions of my curriculum around Sill's past books and look forward to using this book as well. The stories are thorough, yet written in a way that the average person, who may not necessarily feel that they have a valid knowledge on art, could walk away from it with a new understanding and interest. And just the opposite, for someone who is innvolved in art, this book is beautifully put together and would be a valued part of any art book collection."
3,Short but interesting,"I enjoyed reading the book and learned useful information. I was disappointed because I didn't realize how short the book was. The book comes across as trying very hard to be politically correct. It also reads as though it is aimed at young women, not photographers."
2,"compelling story, not well written","The first part of Elizabeth Kim's story is gripping, but then it gets wooden as it meanders through the various abuses she endures from her adoptive parents and her husband. This reads like it is a first draft rather than a polished, reflective consideration of how racial and religious intolerance affect children."
3,Ten Thousand Sorrows,"I first read her story in an excerpt from the magazine ""O"". Couldn't believe what this young girl lived through. I couldn't wait to get the book and read it. I really enjoyed the book up until she fled from her abusive husband then the book seemed to get wordy and mythical. I don't doubt her life it just seemed to go on and on. It seemed to me that she was just looking for words to fill the pages towards the end."
5,Hang Up the Phone and Buy the First Goldfinger Cd!,"I went to the store one day looking for the cd Hangups by Goldfinger. I wasnt a huge fan of the band, just had heard some of their stuff and wanted to check them out more. Hangups wasnt there, but I did see their self titled one. I looked it over, and was cautious, but I bought it anyways. I soon became addicted, and figured out that this cd is 10 times better than Hangups! (I now own both cds). This is a cd that truly captures punk music. If you like this cd, I suggest you check out Hangups, even though it doesnt contain as much hardcore punk as this one. Goldfinger is truly a great band on their way to the top of the punk charts. This cd definitely proves that."
2,cheaply made,"At 60, I've been buying Jockey brand underwear for my family and self for just about as long as I can remember. But this latest delivery was a saddest example of a good brand gone cheap. or maybe made in China, don't know. The band use to be soft and without unfinished edges that dig into your skin. These fall way short, just being the material of the panty rolled over a extremely small band of eleastic. Sorry to say I won't be buying from Jockey again."
1,"Yes, it's really THAT bad","What can I say? I bought ""Da Last Don"" and was able to enjoy it, but there was no joy in sitting through this. Again, the acting is awful (surprise, surprise) and the character Snoop plays is impossible to like. Even ""No Limit"" fans probably will feel cheated."
5,fooking brilliant,"all i have to say is that this album is absolutly amazing-i've been waiting months to finally get this album after first seeing this band open for beachwood sparks last year. i've followed this sexy rock'n'roll band around to spaceland and cafe bleu and back and i can't get enough...if you like good rock (the good rolling stones/60's heroin hash blow your mind kind man) then you'll groove to this much. beautiful, man...eat a peach."
1,misrepresented CD,"This CD, like its companion Vol 2, purports to have 40 tracks, but there are only two tracks, 10-12 minutes each (and each track having perhaps half a minute devoted to each of 20 songs resulting in two ten minute medleys). 20 minutes of music on a cd might be ok if it weren't misrepresented as 40 separate tracks, and if the music itself were outstanding. Unfortunately the music is insipid musak style elevator music."
2,Disapointed,"Be sure to check Zone code on any DVD you purchase, I had no idea that there were different zone codes and I received my movie and it will not play in the United States so now I am out my money and I have a movie that is worthless."
2,"Tries hard to be funny, but isn't",Tim Robbins plays a man who thinks he's discovered his wife having an affair with his boss. He meets up with Martin Lawrence when Lawrence trie to car jack him. They end up working as a team to rob Robbins' boss. Then they find out his wife isn't having an affair after all and he has to try to fix things. This is an amiable enough movie but has no real laugh out loud scenes and Lawrence plays the same mugging boob he always plays and his act gets old fast.
5,Nothing To Lose has It All!,"This movie is none stop action and humor and ""Yes"" danger.In the beginning you really feel for this guy because what he thinks he witnesses is the worst pain one can suffer, infidelity.But don't hit the stop button! It isn't what he thinks...This movie has it all: Action, Danger, Twists & Turns; keep guessing, Just a Dash of Romance and BEST OF ALL the LAUGHS DON'T STOP!"
4,Casual Guide to the World of Espionage,"This is a fun outsider's guide to espionage. The text is accessible enough for readers as young as early teens. Artwork complements the text nicely.Good:-Casual treatment of real espionage subject matter-Writing is a very easy read-Anecdotes and historic figures and incidents-Direct quotes from spies and related personnel-Material attempts to relate spy skills to everyday life, travel, etc.Bad:-Could have been a little more in-depth-Some treatment of the subject was a little sillyReading this book will not, obviously, prepare one for work as a spy. It does pull back the curtain on an interesting field and makes some of the techniques applicable to non-spy activities.This book would make a good gift for anyone (from young teens to adults) having an interest in the subject, or perhaps as a light (!) introduction for those curious about what espionage or intelligence as a career might entail."
1,Don't bother,"I work with children of all ages and not one of them could make this car go. Very frustrating! Although cool looking and very inexpensive, don't waste the time or money."
1,fiction,he got her name right. that is where the certifiable facts end. pure trash eaten up by idiots who insist on believing anything thatfits what they already want to believe
4,good research,Wolfe presents an exhaustive amount of research on the events surrounding Monroe's death and her state of mind at the time. You may agree with the author's conclusions (he says Robert Kennedy killed her) or reach your own conclusions. (I think her shrink did it.) The book throughly covers the mood in L.A. at the time and I liked it for that as well as its exploration of Marilyn's death. The book only needs a bit more comment on Monroe's psychology to make it authoritative.
5,This book should be read by all Americans,I found the book to be well researched and certainly leaves no doubt that Marilyn was murdered. If more people read this book then maybe it would create enough interest to have put pressure on those in authority to have further investigations. This book points out how corrupt and powerful the Kennedy Family and the FBI are. I am from Australia and the book is titled The Assassination of Marilyn Monroe. I wish the title remained the same in America because this is what happened and maybe more people would take notice.
5,Mind Blowing,"Not being a Marilyn fan I was blown away by this book, I couldn't put it down. My father in law who is also not a fan and hasn't read a book all the way through in 20 years, finished this enlighting book in two days. Of course him being a retired state trooper he usually knows the truth when he sees it. If you don't read another book this year you have to read this one. Marilyn fan or not this book will astonish you. All the facts and evidence you want are right there in black and white. The bottom line is, anyone who really wants to know the truth or is just a little curious like I was must read this book."
5,"As with all her writings, Ann welcomes you into the adventure as a partner.","Through her words the canyon experience is shared, with both the positives and negatives, and visualized. I am there and I can see it. I may never run the canyon, but thanks to Ann, I've been there."
3,Stay Awhile,"I have been a trio fan for over 35 years, collected all their Lp's, including all the Decca issues. I always enjoyed Stay Awhile because of the song selection. My favorites are Rusting In The Rain, Three Song and Stories Of Old. Here you have a few songs written by Rod McKuen and Mason Williams,where the vocals and guitar work are excellent. I will agree that Decca's recording quality doesn't come close to Voyle Gilmore's well produced sessions at Capitol, but they're still a pleasure to listen to. I say to all Kingston Trio fans new and old, do not nix or reject the Decca years of the Trio, as there are some recordings that should be reviewed and appreciated."
1,Fell asleep 3 times,"What a waste of time this one was, 3 nights in a row my wife & I tried to watch it & fell asleep all 3 nights. Simpleton humor, juvenile characters, no substance whatsoever. I generally love comedies, but I consider this one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
1,Region 2? Really?,"Is there a reason that it couldn't be announced, that this can't be played in the US? I never knew that there were region codes to look for, shame on me and shame on the one that sold me this crappy paper weight."
4,Great Movie,"As a die hard fisherman I have always enjoyed this movie. I have never been able to find it on DVD until I logged into Amazon. I did however make the mistake of not reading that this was the PAL version so it is incompatible with all of my DVD/multimedia devices. I eventually modded my computer just to watch this movie.Great movie, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Joe Pesci movies or just likes fishing in general."
4,these guys are so unlucky!,this movie is really funny.they get struck by lightning and everything bad happens to them it is so funny
4,Excellent Mod/Garage band,"This is one of those retro-feeling discs that gets better everytime you put it on! Fans of The Who, Small Faces and 60's sounds will enjoy this three piece band from the UK (manic female drummer!), as well as the songs. There are lots of groups out there with the feel, but many of them lack strong tunes - not so here! If you like this, check out other groups on the Voxx label - you won't regret it...."
2,AVERAGE..,"COmpared to other ex-Maiden solo efforts, like Dickinson's ""ACCIDENT OF BIRTH"" and Blaze's ""SILICON MESSIAH"", this album by legenday Adrian SMith is nothing less than a greta dissapointment. Of course it's not bad played, it's just that the songs are not good. For you to have a clear idea, is similar to Dickinson's SKUNKWORKS..."
1,One minute of additional footage?,"Why bother? The extra footage is a ploy! It seemed stupid to make a directors cut if the movie itself was good to begin with. I love this movie but I was highly disappointed with this DVD, not enough bang for the buck I am afraid. There are better DVD's than this and I know in the future they will make a decent directors cut that is worth watching."
1,All the Special Effects in the World Can't Save This Bomb,"A lot of people seem to think that good special effects make for a good movie. Those people are wrong. Without a solid script and an intriguing storyline, no movie can be saved by cool visual effects. This movie has only one memorable moment, when the maniacal, little clown turns into a cheerleader and does some goofy cheers. That was actually hysterical. The rest of this film was hysterically bad. Martin Sheen must be experiencing the lowest low of his career. To think that the same guy who had the lead in ""Apocalypse Now,"" a classic about the Vietnam War, would appear in this piece of trash is more frightening than anything. It doesn't say much for the enduring quality of an actor's career, no matter what great films he or she has starred in. Anyway, Spawn is awful, but might be worth seeing just for the joy of watching a really horrendous film."
4,The Devil Never Had A Chance...,This SPAWN movie I thought was fun and fantastic. I was looking forward to a series of more SPAWN movies but it has yet to happen. Speedy delivery and product in great shape.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"If all you look for in a movie is big explosions and cool computer graphics, you'll love this movie. Anyone who is interested in a plot will absolutely hate it. This was a terrible movie."
3,Spawn (Director's Cut),"The movie could have been done so much more to capture the actual comic. The setup of the main character, plot, and ending all were lacking. Spawn was a great comic and this movie just couldn't give it justice. That said, the movie was okay, I am sure the budget wasn't big enough. Decent movie, just wish the director for batman begins was doing the job."
2,I've seen worse,Spawn is a watchable movie but it's disappointing to fans of the comic.The special effects are amazing but the storyline leaves a lot to be desired.
1,Read the Comic Book Instead,"Special effects are good, and that is just about it. The screenplay--if you can call it that--seems like it was written by a prepubescent; the ""plot"" is ridiculous and incoherent, and the dialogue, well, I have heard better in saturday morning cartoons. The film's attempt at a profound meaning is naive. Please, do not expect me to deliniate the story for you--it is muddled and unfathomable.""Spawn"" left me thinking, ""What kind of a film is this?"". For example: In one particular scene, Spawn jumps into a fireplace (yes, a fireplace) and is transported to a hell-like dimension where he encounters an army of demons led by some kind of fire monster. If you want a good laugh, listen to the monster's farsical and cartoonish voice! It may be worth watching just for that!I have never actually read it, but after watching the film, I cannot help but think you would be better off reading the comic book."
1,Boring childish desaster,"I expected an adult movie, as dark and cynic as the comics. What I saw was a children's film, with a ridiculous story and silly dialogues. Are there no more science-fiction movies for people older than eight ? I liked the special effects and the soundtrack, but this film will be evidence for everybody to claim that science-fiction and comics are for simple-minded people. For a few moments it creates a sinister atmosphere like ""The Crow"", but most times ""Spawn"" is very disappointing."
2,THIS AIN'T SPAWN...,"I've read the Spawn comic for the past five years, and this movie doesn't do it justice. The animated series is a lot better. At least this isn't as bad as the Blade movie."
2,Hollow,"At first glance, this movie looks to be a special effects feast. In reality, that's all it is. Awesome effects, a good production design, excellent action sequnces and a humorous dialogue (Clown), are the only things keeping this one from falling thanks to a story that is vague, illogical and often makes no sense. Fans of the hit comic book will be disappointed."
2,Stick with the Animated Version,"Michael Jai White is impressive as Spawn but is saddled with a rather wooden characterization. Obviously, Martin Sheen filmed many of his scenes unsure of the ""effect"" to which he would be acting.The only saving grace is the magnificent Leguizamo as ""The Clown."" He is totally in character and unrecognizable as the sinister hellish acolyte."
1,What a complete waste of time,"I think my title sums it up. I can't believe that Todd McFarlane (Spawn creator) could have spent so long developing his incredible comic book (the art alone is wroth the cover price!), and then coped out and let this piece of garbage into theaters. I thought the old Captain America movie was awful, but this movie is probably the worst comic to film translation I've EVER seen. How bad it is has become especially apparent in the last few years since the release of Blade (which rocked), and the upcoming Blade 2 and Spiderman movies. The only comic to film transition even close to being this bad in recent memory is X-Men, another complete waste of time and money. If you're into Spawn, buy the animated series, all 3 seasons, on DVD, and be happy."
2,UNFORTUNATLY this is the movie that set the genre!!!!!!!!,"This is the fist movie with ""THAT"" kind of special effects and along with the first superheroe movie with super CG action productions.After this came Blade, then Star Wars #1, then Matrix, then X Men, Spiderman, Van Helsing, and even Constantine.WHY, WHY this movie???!!!The acting is TERRIBLE (except for Leguizano), CHEAP dialoge, where's the blood and gore??!!, Spawn looks LAME without the cape, Spawn's chains where NOT scary as the tv serie, Spawn use to much guns instead of his body, AND SPAWN CAN FLY??!!At least this is not the first BAD movie that set genres! (let's not forget Tron) but ""this"" special effects are very popular today. MAN!... I hope that the next action movie that set genres don't make the same mistake as this one. Let's make ORIGINAL action movies like Dirty Harry, Mad Max, King Kong, Star Wars #4 and #6, Terminator, Saving Private Ryan or SupermanADIOS!"
1,too technicl,It was useless to me. It looks like a guide to persons who want to teach a child to read; it has serious teaching instruction. All I wanted was basic reading like see Jane run for my 5-yr old grand nephew.
2,Sucked,This movie sucked don't even waste your time the plot is dumb the acting is so-so at best I would not waste 2 hrs on this if I were you and I am a De niro and Whitaker fan but this movie is garbage
2,Junk,"I was really disappointed that Robert DeNiro was in this movie, I expected better. The movie showed way too much sex, violence and drug useage. I wouldn't watch it again."
1,amizing support and for what?,"Well the supporting actors in this movie are crazy talented. I'd like to put all the blame on 50 Cent but the script had holes like a slice of Swiss cheese. It was cops being blatant criminals all the time. So much they might as well have had the words crook unit on their cars. This was no ""Training Day"". It could have been like that if you had a better script and maybe not 50 cent. I'm always surprised how wooden he is. After seeing this all I could say was ""Why?"""
3,fair.....,I would say this movie was fair. its cops and robbers. no guess work in this flick. I can just say it OK
4,In Love,"I just love me some Robert. He is one of the greatest actors I know. Wish I was a little younger, because he would be flooded with my mail, instead of fan mail."
1,Stinkfest,"I did not hate this movie.Selecting only one star automatically populated the ""I hate it"" tag line.Thank you Amazon for telling everyone what you think a single star rating means.If the customer has no control over what a single star means then whyis the customer REQUIRED to do this part?"
1,Hollywood Garbage,Typical Hollywood Garbage..... You would think this day and age that Hollywood could come up with new stories rather than the same old gangster garbage. I would expect something like this from a 50 cent sell out and I guess Robert Deniro can play only one type of role/personality so I should have known better. I want the $4 and 2 hours of my life back I wasted on this stupid movie!
1,A complete disappointment,The book is a complete disappointment - it is essentially a re-hash of common sense and does not provide anything constructive. I recommend talking to a good lawyer to develop a competitive advantage using the law.
5,Finally--an eye cream that works!,"I have tried different eye creams searching for the ""right"" fit. Moroccan Garden uses natural ingredients that help create intense moisture and a refreshing scent. I use this eye cream both morning and night."
3,"OK Frame, for the price, nice & simple","Frame is pretty good, I purchased for grandparents as a gift, therefore looking for something simple - not many bells and whistles to confuse them.Just wanted to point out something I misunderstood when reading the product description: the photos will only display in the order in which they are loaded (usually by file name or date). The 'Random' setting refers to the transition type the frame uses to change between photos (slide in from top, bottom, fade, left to right, etc.). You CANNOT change the order the photos are displayed on the frame."
1,What happened to the high resolution spec?,I bought this because it boasted a high resolution. I see now that its not even in the description. Now I am stuck with a digital frame that distorts all my pictures to the point where you can't even tell who's in the picture. It would be nice if Aluratek would even bother to put what resolution and picture size they intended this frame for in the manual or on their site. DO NOT BUY THIS FRAME!
4,Not Bad,"The picture is sharp, but it'd be nice if the frame would maximize the pictures on its screen automatically. I don't like the white spaces on the sides."
3,Overall vague but does have a couple of tips,I thought the video was more about showing how well Matty can train a dog versus actually showing me how to train my dog. It had a couple of useful tips but alot of issues are dealt with very quickly without any real depth. good video to start with.
2,Kari Wuhrer fans beware,"This movie was a disappointment. Any fan wanting to see Kari Wuhrer will be let down as she is hardly in the movie. She appears in a few short scenes, and the rest of the movie was not worth the price of the DVD. I recommend renting this movie before deciding to buy it."
3,"Steamy southern mystery, can really heat up and chill you.","In this southern based mystery, a ""battle-scarred"" (actually, emasculated) alcholic-detective investigates the dissapearance of a local ""Lolita."" Hot nudity was edited to a minimum (unfortunately,) and the E.S.P. angle was a wierdly interesting twist.The ensemble cast was ""integrated and believable"" from one character to another, and they were characters that interested me in the outcome.The wrap-up of the plot was oddly brief, as if it were ""Apocolypse Now,"" where the director had one vision, and the studio another where they said, ""No, we need more action...Let's blow it all up!""Nice eye-candy, and sumptuous southern cinematography, make it worth checking out...even if plot is weak or wierd, er...I mean, eclectic."
1,"Did he do this because he was bored, or what?","This video got me hot and bothered, too, but I agree whole-heartedly with every unflattering thing every other reviewer has said. Compared to his role in Major Leaque, this movie looked like something made in his garage while under the influence of...something. It had kind of a Twin Peaks feel to it, and I actually was interested in who killed the bimbo. I felt for Berenger having to be on that dialysis thing even though at the same time I was wondering if that's really how it's done. Well, anyway, Berenger is doing motor oil commercials now. How the mighty have fallen."
5,Great Software.,"Amazing, Sound Editing Functions. Has been a tremendous help. Thanks Kindly. : )Kenn"
2,No way!,"All these shinny reviews below... Gosh! This album is nothing more than the great Adrian Smith aping the Seattle and grunge sound to the bone, simply to go with the trends and try to make some money.This IS NOT hard rock, as some reviewers wrote. This does not even has a hint of Adrian's influences. It's as if you were listening to Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains ou Sondgarden, all in the same album. Even the vocal approach is exactly the same... Originality = zero.Anyway, this does not means that the songs are put to listen in your car or in your house as background music. Because there's no memorable tune in the whole bunch.Anyway, there are"
5,Hot stuff!,This is absolutely perfect for what I need. It's compact and still able to singe the ends of shock cord or to heat shrink tubing.
2,Good ideas.. bad writing style.,"When I picked this book up in the bookstore, I read the summary on the back. When I saw 'All of us are trapped by a complex web of corporate and governmental behemoths ... that controls our airways, educates our children, and manages every facet of our lives."" I immediately became interested. This is an idea that I have explored thoroughly, and loved to read any extensive perspective on it.Gerry Spence's comparison between full-blown slaves and the american public was very compelling and eerie. And his ideals to change things, while I don't agree with every one of them, are very fascinating.Unfortunately, Spence's writing style is very erratic. The book is nothing more than a collaboration of independent ideas and perspectives sectioned off into non-continous brackets. He hardly ever has a continous thought that spans more than one page, and the discontinuity makes some chapters very fuzzy and incoherent."
4,A great book until you're halfway through it.,"The first half of the book was excelent in saying that it's not government or corporations that oppress us, it's both. This concept seems alien in the US, where people are mostly whining about just the government. However, toward the middle of the book, his theme gets repeatative, and then the ""dreams"" he has at the end seem to run against what he stated earlier in the book. True, these ideas are supposed to bring more freedom, but for the most part they are more rules and regulations that inevidably be stacked upon the millions of other rules that create large beauracracies like goverment and mutlinational corps. It seems like he had a good idea going, and then just got lazy. If it weren't for the strength of the begining theme, I would have given this book 2 or 3 stars."
1,What a disappointment!,"I have enjoyed Gerry Spence's advocacy of the downtrodden. I read From Freedom To Slavery with joy at its simple wisdom. But now he has given me a book that is too long for its theme, not as well-written as his previous tomes, and full of ideas antithetical to his self-proclaimed devotion to freedom. I could overlook some of his earlier paranoia and anti-liberty views in the context of his overall framework in other books, but here he suggests people be forced to vote, that citizens be banned from helping candidates they support, and that his one-time foe, Government, control more of our lives. The man has lost any concept of freedom, and why government is what Washingon called ""fire.""This book is going to shock libertarians, both civil and economic. If you respected Spence for his ""let-me-live-free"" attitude, this book will give up any positive feelings for his opinions. Thank goodness he's still a good lawyer."
3,"Good for a dinner party, or a quiet dinner at home","The track selection is perfect for dinner with guests or a more formal party. You'll find that the music adds to the atmosphere but doesn't discourage conversation because of it's comfortable volume. These classics will not bother any guests!It's not as long as I would have liked though. You will likely be repeating tracks over several evenings, and you will want to buy this in tandem with other music if you're anticipating a long dinner."
4,Nice rack!,"Good-looking rack to hold my Guinness collector plates. I only wish the 4 brackets which actually hold the plates fit into their slots a bit more snugly. They just sort of hook on and loosely hang -- not a problem, of course, as long as the rack is never touched. However, I could imagine a few scenarios wherein one of the brackets might get knocked out of its slot, causing a plate to crash to the floor . . . which would then throw the entire rack out of balance and send the other three crashing to the floor behind it. Hmmm . . . perhaps I should reconsider my decision to hang it by wire on a single hook. ha ha"
5,I Heart Queen V,"This movie is not historically accurate, however I absolutely love this movie. This movie shows how one person who lost someone they TRULY LOVE and what that lost love can do to the person who is left behind. Once they truly find a true friend and soul mate ( not in a sexual way )can bring that person back to life and back to society.It is truly a feel good movie. I saw this in the theaters years ago, rented it on VHS and brought it. Now I'm finally replacing all my movies on DVD and this movie was one of the first to buy. Thank you Amazon for having it at a reasonable price."
4,Good acting - good story,"Mrs Brown is a beautifully filmed story of the (possible) relationship between Queen Victoria and her long time servant, the Scott, Mr Brown. He came into her life when she needed someone to lean on after the death of Albert. Although she outgrew him eventually, they were close, if not always near, friends until he died.The performance by Billy Connelly is wonderful and he pushes back against the headstrong Queen initialy and heart rending when it is necessary for him to take a back seat.Judy Dench is delightful as the mourning but stubborn Queen Victoria.The first appearance in film of Gerard Butler, another delightful Scot, as Archie, the brother to Mr Brown, is delightful for ""Gerry"" fans around the world.An interesting tale with many possibilities. Ladies, a tissue would not go astray if you are that way inclined."
4,Great movie!,This was a really good film. I love these two actors and they did take liberties with the truth but it's worth owning. You just can't go wrong with Judi Dench.
4,Mrs. Brown,"A great film, beautifully acted, great photography. A little known piece of history tastefully presented. I'd recommend viewing for anyone over the age of 15"
4,Thoroughly interesting film with wonderful acting.,"Those interested in Queen Victoria or Victorian times will love this movie. The acting by Judi Dench is brilliant, and the supporting cast does wonderfully, especially Antony Sher as Disraeli. This is a delicate love story. It's also a super illustration of the life of a queen, with all the staff and houses and clothes and perks..."
2,Her majesty Mrs Brown,The poor rating is for the quality of the DVD itself. Not the movie. The Movie is great. DVD is a bootleg with subtitles that can't be disabled. Also menu options are very limited.
2,Her Majesty. Mrs Brown,The movie was long and drawn out. I had a hard time holding my interest and it had no social value
3,"Good, but a pain","I bought this at my college bookstore. Since you can fold it up it saves space and makes it portable. It becomes real handy I found in study groups and there is a lack of space. But when keeping the book up near the beginning or end of the sucks. I also noticed when using a paperback textbook and you have it opened in the middle, the pages fold and you end up tilting your head to read or using your hand to hold it up."
5,Another positive review,"Like many others who have reviewed this product, I've tried a number of different portable book stands. This one stands out. Its simple design belies its many strengths. It's first of all very light and portable. It's also quite stable, at least when you've got a book on it. It works great with soft and hardcover books, big books are no problem. I've even been known to stand up a three ring binder. Book angle is easily adjustable by raising/lowering the back and swinging the arms out further. I've had one of these for years and just bought a second. Great product!"
3,Good for certain things,"This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling up part of the metal frame, but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight."
2,This Book Holder Doesn't Hold Books Well,"I have owned this product for many years considering it almost useless and only now when looking for a useful portable book stand I learned how good this one was. First, reading the reviews, I didn't even suspect that I owned such a great product and then, after I realized and confirmed it by looking at the picture, I took it out and tested again.First, as one (at least) review has mentioned, it's impossible to adjust angle between the book and the surface.Second, it doesn't conveniently hold average paperback even in the middle of the book and makes the first and last dozens of pages hardly readable.Third, even the books it can hold (mostly large heavy hard backs) require constant adjustment on the stand to remain readable so you cannot just easily flip through the pages back and forth.Forth, it, probably, can be convenient for a relatively static use of a reference book, i.e., if one needs to look on a few pages in a narrow range."
5,Good buy,This was/is a good buy. As advertised and handy to have around. I have used notebooks and school books of all shapes and sizes.
5,Super Funky,"My first Crafty Chica book was ""The Crafty Diva's D. I. Y. Stylebook: A Grrrl's Guide to Cool Creations You Can Make, Show Off, and Share"" and I loved it so much that before I even finished looking through the whole bookk, I had gone to the computer to order ""La Casa Loca: Latino Style Comes Home 45 Funky Craft Projects for Decorating & Entertaining.""""La Casa Loca"" has some amazing crafts inside. My head is literally spinning from all the ideas this book has inspired. Soon enough my ho-hum apartment will be turned into a super funky Latina inspired apartment. Best of all, it will be unique and cost effective!Thank you Crafty Chica, you are an inspiration!"
2,"Disappointed, not worth the price.","This 12 can case arrived with 80% of cans dented and damaged. Outside packing was fine, but obviously the product was shrink-wrapped inside with the damaged cans. I have purchased this flavor soup many times from my local grocery and am very familiar with quality and taste. This batch did not measure up - taste was off and appearance was not quite the same. Dumplings were especially awful and different from product in the past. I find I have to ""doctor"" it up with herbs, etc. from my garden. Very disappointed, would not purchase this on-line again."
1,Disappointed.,Never would load. Very disappointed. Tried for several times daily for over a week. Kept saying there was a problem loading video. Had a very strong wi-fi connection.
4,Tons of fun and excitement for the kids,Kids love to play with this parachute. Very exciting. Kids from ages 18 month to 8 yrs can have fun and play.
3,Two out of three isn't bad...,"...but Funland was just not up to snuff. Cool if you happen to be expecting a '70s T.V.-esque drama, but I was not. I was expecting a horror movie.Carnival of Souls is cool if you must have the classics, although there are other collections that have this one that don't come with Funland.The main attraction here is Caligari, of course, one of the world's first horror films. Awesome every single time. I may actually drop this product and just go with a copy of Caligari, though again, Carnival of Souls isn't bad."
4,"shoddy writing, wonderful ideas","I haven't read this book, but my biology professor in college is one of the foremost researchers in the field of neuroscience, and has told me that the ideas and theories set forth by Damasio are very respected in their field. My professor, like many other researchers and science scholars, has read the book several times, and his only criticism of it is that the writing is horrible and hard to get through. He said the sentences are belabored and ridiculous, but worth reading anyhow because of the groundbreaking information set forth in this book. Other books he recommends: Phantoms of the Brain, the less scientific The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, and an unrelated one: Botany of Life."
3,elegant thinking burdened by kludgey writing,"Damasio carefuly builds up what might be called a ""heirarchy of awareness"" that moves up from the most primitive reactions to the highest level of self awareness. He marshalls evidence from several domains to build each step in this edifice, including examples of patients with brain damage and self-reflection. It is a nice model.But reading this book as a layman was downright painful. His writing has absolutely no elegance to it. He describes the structure he is building again and again - as if a reader could be intelligent enough to follow his nuanced examples but not intelligent enough to remember from one page to the next how the story was unfolding.If you are willing to trudge through some slow text there are some interesting ideas here. But if your reading time is limited don't invest it in this book."
5,The best nail product,"I have used Rejuvacote for about 7 years and have purchased it as gifts for family and friends because it is so good. It absolutely works to make nails retain their natural strength. I regularly use Rejuvacote as my standard base coat under nail polish, but if my nails start to break, crack or peel usually due to my own abuse doing gardening or cleaning, I just begin applying an additional top coat daily as instructed. Within a short time I am able to file away the damage and my own nails are strong again. This is a good price too. The best local retail price I've found is $10, but often it is $14.95."
1,Did not work for me,"I am very disappointed by this product. It MIGHT strengthen my nails if it were to stay on them! I followed the instructions and after putting on the initial base coat, it said to reapply a top coat every other day. Well the base coat was chipping by the end of the first day, and topping it off with a top coat just made it chip more. VERY DISAPPOINTED! I was really hopeful after reading the other reviews, but now I am just convinced that there is no hope for my nails - especially not this!"
2,Results for product. ...Duri Cosmetics Rejuvacote,As of now...I still have had no results with this product. I have used it exactly the way the directions were written on package....still no results....I will give it more time. The nails have not grown at all. What am I doing wrong?????
5,Great For Weak Nails,"This product was magical for me when I moved to an extreme climate and my nails were so dry they peeled and broke. Within several weeks I noticed a difference. My manicurist first introduced Duri Rejuvacote to me, but she charged almost double the price. So glad I found it online. I often use it alone, without color, and it leaves a nice finished-looking shine."
5,amazing,"I wore acrylics for over ten years and after removing them my nails split horizontally at the tips - very frustrating. It did not resolve for over a year, but after using Rejuvacote for a month now they are so much better! I have not experienced the burning issue some have - I think perhaps some people are more sensitive. It lasts for quite a while even though you have to use it every day - well worth the price it's available at online."
2,Intel Mac Caution,"The keyboard that came with this when I ordered it was NOT their newer ""Plug and Play"" version that works with Intel Macs out of the box - it apparently requires an addition $30 ""upgrade accessory kit."" To quote from their website:To use your eMedia Learn to Play Keyboard Pack with an Intel Mac, you must have the latest ""Plug and Play"" version of the MIDI keyboard or you need the Legacy MIDI Keyboard Upgrade Accessory Kit from eMedia. Before you order an upgrade kit, please check your MIDI keyboard to see if you already have the ""Plug and Play"" version. The ""Plug and Play"" version has a round ""Plug and Play"" sticker under the keyboard and octave transpose buttons located above the ""Pitch Bend"" and ""Modulation"" wheels to the upper left of the keyboard. If you don't have these features you have the legacy version of the keyboard, and you need the upgrade kit - which can be ordered from our upgrades order form."
1,Save your Money. This product never worked even with support onLine.,Bought it for the good review. It never worked even with the online support help. The SW never talked to the HW. The support blame the Windows-XP-SP2 missing drivers. I did reload the Windows-SP2 and still does not work.Save your money and buy a real midi keyboard. This one never really got tested under customer hands.
1,USELESS!!!! No stars,"Bought this last Christmas for my daughter, I may as well have just thrown the $100 out the window. It never worked, and the support is nonexistent. By time the gift was given and figured out it would never work it was too late to return it. Don't waste your money."
2,Litter bag not of much value,"This bag does not stick to anything. Keeps falling over, lid makes it hard to put anything in it. Overall, worthless."
5,methinks it's a little mastergiantpiece,"First off, Johnny can BLOW. 5 stars right to the Big Dipper and back.This is one of my favorite jazz recordings. Perhaps it's the minor keys and soft cacophony? It's got a certain feel like you are smack dab in the middle of a teeming big city, but also can hunker down at the local coffee shop. You can see the fog rolling in, see your breath in the window, hear the trains, catch a peep of springtime through the L steaming down the tracks. This set feels to me the combo of the simple joy from cozy home-cooking, and the atomic energy of a rocket launching. Like jazz.""Small piece of leather, but well put together""Blow, Johnny, Blow."
4,A Good Optimistic Outlook,"Don't be put off by the cover photo. This is a great overview of the environmental issue. But as opposed to many books by environmental doomsday prophets, this book tells a cautionary tale but also offers hope. It also gives some practical examples of how we can affect change. Although it gets a bit cheesy at times, Attkisson's optimism is refreshing."
3,A little dissapointed.,"My 2 year old granddaughter walked up to this piano and was just looking at it,she started to move it and the top came off. It looks durable, but maybe not so."
2,"Looks nice, doesn't sound good","My parents bought this piano for my son's third birthday. When it arrived, one note was out of tune so I returned it - it was painful to listen to. Otherwise the piano looked nice and seemed sturdy, so I ordered the piano again. This time there were several keys that were slightly out of tune, but we thought it was good enough given it is intended for young kids. Then we discovered the song book and color strip were missing, so I had to return it again. This time I didn't bother to reorder it. The other thing I take issue with, is that Schoenhut makes a big deal about German music rods, it's long history and traditional manufacturing techniques. Their website has a section on it's factory in Florida, but the pianos are made in China and the company clearly doesn't have its quality under control. I don't have a problem buying Chinese products in general, but I think Schoenhut is misleading its customers."
1,The shipping costs more than the product.,"Ive never given a product such a low rating, but when the shipping is more than the cost of the product, I find it hard to swallow."
5,BEST BODY WASH; cleans well without drying out skin,"This is the favorite body wash of both myself and my husband. We like that it cleans well without drying out your skin. It goes on smooth and smells great, with a neutral scent that seems neither feminine nor masculine. We love that it has Shea Butter that moisturizes while you clean. Shea Butter is a plant-based emollient from the nuts of the Shea tree (Butyrospermum parkii) that mimics the lipid content of the skin making it easily absorbed by the skin thereby improving moisture retention. It is wonderful for dry and dehydrated skin leaving it feeling soft and smooth."
1,Worst Monitor Ever,Tired of hearing your baby cry? This is the monitor for you. You'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing. Looks like Evenflo was being literal when they named the product Whisper Connect. You can barely hear anything at full volume. I'm going to return it tomorrow if I can resist backing over it with our car.
1,Waste of money,"The device is very flaky. It's incompatible with a lot of NICs of the leading manufactures (Intel, Realtek, Marvell). I have two PCs with Realtek network adapters and they both connect at maximum 100Mbit/s. On the other hand, my Lenova laptop and Iomega network HDD work just fine at 1000Mb/s.It's a well known problem that is not mentioned by NetGear in the unit description (and because of this I think they are cheating customers). Unfortunately, for me it's too late to return the device but you can save your money by choosing another switch/manufacturer. The compatibility problem is well discussed at Netgear official forum, for example here: [...] encourage you to read this forum BEFORE buying the switch."
2,Worked great for 6 months,"I bought this along with a larger NetGear switch. This worked great for about 6-months, then it just stopped working. The other switch is still working for now."
5,Great,"I have been using NetGear ProSafe Gigabit Ethernet switches for years. Always the best, always reliable. They are rock solid. There are no better unmanaged switches."
1,Not compatible with Intel Pro1000 network adapters,"When connected to Intel Pro 1000 series Ethernet adapters there can be serious problems with this switch ... Inability to connect at 1Gbps, strange speeds, dropped packets. Generally not a good combination"
5,Very Fast and Reliable Switch,I purchased this switch because my Airport Extreme didn't have enough ports for my home. It is reliable and has excellent speeds. It's truly plug-n-play.
4,FYI: This is more compact than the picture atop its page indicates,"This switch is barely larger than its 5 ports require, without the 2 inches of wasted space indicated by the photo at the top of its description. The second photo, lower in the page is accurate.Personally, I'm thrilled to have both it and its power brick so small, and like the durable metal case.Ideal use for this device is a location with only one wired Ethernet RJ45 jack, and needing to plug in 2+ Ethernet devices at that location. We used to stock its Fast-Ethernet predecessor like popcorn for such uses, and even in my home I already have 2, with a third on order.Update: I expect thanks are due to Amazon. I'd earlier updated this entry to report Netgear was refusing to honor a rebate on this product because I'd bought it from a non-participating dealer. But I recently got a corrected notice from Netgear, reporting the rebate will now be paid. Thanks Amazon!"
3,coffee drinker,"After much thought and research, I chose the Tervis insulated cup for my coffee over the Bodum. I find the Tervis cools down the coffee too quickly for my liking due to the wide mouth. I did buy the Bodum and am enjoying them using them gently to avoid breaking. I am looking forward to trying cold drinks in the Tervis this summer."
5,superb text for genealogists,"""Jackson's White Plumes"" is a superb text which summarizes beautifully the details of many of the battles during the Wars of 1812 in Alabama. For genealogists, it is invaluable, especially if you have Cherokee ancestry from Alabama. A ""must have"" for any southerner collecting historically accurate texts on military history in the southland."
2,Damaged,"Although the package came quickly which I was really pleased with, there is a HUGE gash in the front of the book about and inch long and then trails off across the book. The box it came in was in perfect condition, even the wrapping thats connected to cardboard was untouched. But the light plastic wrapping around the book was sliced in half and my book is damaged. I even tried to just take of the cover sleeve but the gash goes write through the books hard cover.I really want this book as I am using it for planning my travel, so Im hoping something can be worked out about this. Im just not sure who to contact and how.I usually have really good experiences with buying from Amazon and I recommend it to everyone. This is the first time Ive had a book come badly damaged."
4,Great pics!,I gave this as a gift but took a peek before wrapping it. The pics are gorgeous and would be great for anyone with a serious cases of wander lust. I plan on ordering a copy for myself.
3,A nice coffee table book,"This is an oversized book. I envisioned it more enlightening, specific, inspiring. However it's a casual read, information limited and not enough unique traveler quotes. The perspective is so limited, it's difficult to take much from it and I wonder how accurate it is. There are some great images, but not enough unique ones. For example, several African countries are represented by an image of a child's face, which seems like a cliche. Maybe there isn't much else to photograph in these places, but I doubt it. The book does a fair job of covering every country even those you'd likely never visit, but unfortunately gives short shift on enormous and varied destinations like the USA."
5,Wow...,I bought this book as a present for my father. Once I got it I was truly amazed. Having information and photographs about almost every single country in the world in one book is a most for all world travelers. I liked it so much that I bought one for myself as well.
5,The Travel Book,Just a brief overview of all the countries in the world. The beautiful photoraphs are what made this such a special book. It was a gift so haven't looked at it in detail. Would recommend it as a great coffee table book.
5,Another Treat,"Elizabeth Berg does it again! He books are wonderfully ""readable"" - you will gobble this treat in one sitting if you have the time (as I did with her previous ""Range of Motion"" - it is IMPOSSIBLE to put down.) Her ear for children's thoughts, feelings and conversation is unerring."
2,Weakest Berg entry by far,"I've read all of Elizabeth Berg's books to date and found this one to be a disappointment. The characters were thinly drawn, especially the father. The scenes and dialog were just repetitions of each other, dragging out the obvious conclusion. Her previous books made you feel you knew the characters intimately, in particular ""Range of Motion"" and ""Durable Goods""/""Joy School"". In this book, you just end up frustrated as everyone tends to let everything ""just happen.""Since you know from the beginning of the book that Ginny and Sharla haven't seen their mother in 35 years, Ms. Berg's challenge is to create understanding and empathy in the reader. Unfortunately, she does not pull it off."
3,Beliefs,"I enjoyed Elizabeth Berg's writing, but the subject matter was tough for me to get through. I saw the daughters as spoiled rotten, especially Sharla. I could not sympathize with her at all. Sharla and Ginny have this perfect little life, and then when they are the ages of 13 and 12, respectively, they find out Mommy isn't perfect. Also, I found it hard to believe, that Sharla, after hardening herself towards her mother, was somehow able to go on and have a happy and fruitful life. I don't believe that - any kid with mommy issues the size that Sharla had would most likely go on to be a really unpleasant person, and not have such a normal outcome, as depicted in the book. Perhaps it's believable because the dad is so supportive of his daughters."
4,A good read...but came up short,"I like Elizabeth Berg's books. This was a good story that came up a little empty in the end. Otherwise, it's worth the read."
3,Good,"I love B. B. and the blues. This is not the best concert footage of B. B. available, but it is good."
4,Good ballads,"This is a sombre and at times energetic piano planning by the legend Red Garland. I thouroughly enjoyed the second track on the CD. While I tried to compare some of the songs to other players who have played them, i find Garland's playing mature and mellow."
4,"I have a cowbell, and I know how to use it...","Okay, get this. I ordered this Pearl PCB6 Primero Cowbell and a cowbell beater (Meinl Cowbell Beater Ribbed Grip. I took the cowbell out of the box, picked up the beater, and gave it a test whack. Unfortunately, I was holding it at the base and pointing the open end upward toward my face. It is SO LOUD that I shocked myself. After that initial discovery, I had fun testing different tones while beating around this cowbell. Great price. I'm going to have fun with this."
3,HIS BIGGEST HIT ISN'T HERE!!!!,"""All I Know"" was Art's biggest hit in the USA.It's not on this so called Best Of.Neither is ""Second Avenue""'Nuff said."
5,A favorite!,"This CD is even better than expected. I bought it primarily for I Only Have Eyes for You which is my husband's and my ""song"" from our fifty years of marriage. I have become fond of many more while playing it over and over."
4,The VOICE of Simon & Garfunkel,"When you listen to Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon you understand what a great duo they are. Paul can write, Art can sing!"
4,If you're a Hounds of Love fan this is quite worth your time,"Full disclosure: I'm not a Kate Bush fan. Her music is just not my type of music. Except for Hounds of Love. It's phenomenal. If you're a major fan of her work, well versed in the trivia and minutiae of her career, this DVD may not have anything for you. Its most notable flaw is a lack of participation from Bush herself. But if you're a casual fan, or a fan of this particular album, you may enjoy the presentation.I love the ""sausage-making"" aspects of music documentaries - all the creative decisions, the happy accidents, the fights that changed music history - and the DVD brings them out, track by track. Even without Kate Bush herself present (there's a barely-audible tape interview in the extras) there's plenty of insight from the other musicians."
1,Cover picture negates use,Picture me [a male] handing this book to a female employee - with encouragement to read... of course you can't - and i can't as well
3,"A start, but still places men out of the circle...","This is a good book for combating female stereotypes, yet what does it say to male stereotypes? To me, it still places the issue of restraint on women alone. What about men's role here? I think that she falls short in adressing a TRUE DIALOGUE between the genders and still falls into the idea that it is women's problem. Is there not a better compromise?! But I wish more young women our age would write about our experiences, after all age is not the only indicator of experience because: ""There are some people who see a great deal and some people who see very little in the same things."" (T.H. Huxley"
1,"""self-congratulatory"" an understatement","hey thanks wendy! if your book takes off, maybe we can return everything to the way they used to be...sequals can include A Return to Jim Crow, A Return to Prohibition, and A Return to the Third Reich!Or maybe just ""A Return to the Bookstore for a Refund."""
5,Finally!,"Finally someone has been daring enough to address the devastating impact promiscuity is having on young women.I can't remember how many times in college I watched other women go to a party, get wasted and go to bed with a stranger. I could never figure out what was worse-- that they felt so obliged/compelled/whatever to be sexually active, or that they needed to anesthesize themselves first to go through with it.Return to Modesty may not be the last word on modesty for a new millenium, but it is a very brave and well-done first shot."
1,Naive and boring,"Shalit's premise would be interesting if she knew how to defend it. She doesn't. It's amazing that this book created such hoopla at all, since a badly constructed argument like this (or lack thereof?) hardly merits widespread attention."
1,unfortunate reminder,"The fact that so many American women responded positively to this book is a sad reminder to this feminist: there are a lot of morons out there, and some of them are women."
5,Wife loves it! with one exception...,"Got this for my wife for Christmas. I actually purchased the surface wall mount but installed it inset into the wall quite easily behind the bedroom door. just located the edge of the two studs, traced the outline on the wall board, cut it out with a razor knife, shimed it between the studs as needed and attached it to the studs with four screws. My wife actually asked for it to be out from the wall because of her nails, so I remounted it protruding 1.5 inches and put a spackle bead around the cut edge. Looks great and its hidden when the bedroom door is open. NOW the exception, I'm currently searching for some type of earring holder that will display her earrings inside. Otherwise, very pleased with the product, good construction, nice interior work, and it makes my wife happy."
3,Good movie. Fast five was better.,I love all of these movies just for the action. Fast five to me was better and I cannot wait for six.
2,Snailpaced Pertformance,"Item received on time and working but looks decidely second hand. Drive enclosure full of finger prints (inside & out), case screws damaged and all other components received unsealed. This looks as though it was someone else's return passed off as new goods. Very Poor. Supposed to be a new Item from Tiger Direct.The drive enclosure itself is adequate, the LEDs are a touch bright but quality is only average - see my previous comment. Performance with USB 2.0 very, very slow. A LaCie FireWire External Drive blows this one away as does a Maxtor One Touch Drive (USB 2.0). But it means I can still make use of a 160Gb HDD that would otherwise have been a paperweight."
3,Whats the hype about?,"I don't understand these reviews, this album is average, nothing special. Its the same old over produced Tech N9ne music. The chanting gets repetitive and annoying. Also this album is kind of corny, it kind of reminds me of D12. This is the type of music they will play in Missouri clubs but that's about it. If you want good rap, check out The Roots new album ""Game Theory"""
4,Fatboy Slim's Evil Twin,"Armand's new CD gets down and dirty very quickly. Normally I don't like any sort of techno that comes out of the states but this is an exception. It sounds like Fatboy slim but a lot dirtier. Don't expect too much like ""U don't know me."" This is a good album, don't get me wrong though."
3,Missing a song book,"The volume is loud even on its lower setting, but more importantly, there is no song book. What are the names of the 18 programmed songs? They could be replicated on the four individual keys. This would aid a child in learning to actually play an instrument. The company has seriousl missed an opportunity to increase interactivity."
4,Very Satisfied,"Recieved mine this week and have gone over it closely looking for some of the flaws that some post have mentioned. I can't find anything wrong or questionable. It appears to be VERY strong, sturdy and with nice craftsmanship for an item that says ""Made in China"" on the box. I'm very happy with it. I had a fellow employee show off his the same week and he told me he paid $50 at Walmart. I told him I paid less than $27 on Amazon. I actually had to show him on the website. I would consider mine to be a medium usage tool which makes it perfect for me."
2,purchased two both pliers broke,"There is a problem with the pliers on this model. I purchased two and while crimping something with the pliers they snapped. The other attachments are great such as sheet rock saw, small flat head screw driver work great but flying pliers parts do not scream quality."
1,Broken within two weeks.,"I was using the pliers to hold some wire while doing some fencing and one half of the plier's jaw broke completely off right at the hinge. Absolutely no excuse for this as I used to do the same task with my old Leatherman without any problem.Also, it is very hard to get the various tools opened."
4,good for carry,"Easy to handle than letterman. Go for easy fix that is what these products are suppose to do but for bigger jobs don't be lazy go to you tool box and get better tools. But again this product is good N light weight. Letherman and the other wEIGHTS more. The nylon sheet is great it can go horizontal to the waist or belt making a low profile, I do not recommend getting the exteNsions the bits for this product. Over all it is a good product. An alternative to letherman / sog. KINDA GLOCK VS XD."
2,Don't bother with the Suspension,"Maybe I abuse (or just use) my tools more than the other reviewers, but I've gone through 3 of these Suspensions in 4 months. Bought on a recommendation of a friend.After about a week, the nylon case ripped when it hung on a car seat. Returned for exchange.3 weeks later, broke the plier jaw when using it to twist wire. Returned for exchange. When I mentioned to my friend, he said to not use in a twisting action, the jaws aren't designed for it. No kidding.2 weeks ago, cutting steel wire with it using just my hands (no special leverage) and broke the plier jaw again.The material is not steel, some cast aluminum alloy that is not strong enough for the intended use.Very disappointed in Gerber for putting this piece of junk on the market."
1,unreliable,using this tool out in the yard to tighten a nut and the pliers tool broke. The metal actually cracked in half down both sides. Very cheap
4,Good first multi-tool,"This is a very good tool for the small-budget hobbyist.Besides the small, fragile scissors and the lanyard clip taking up spots, the misc. tool features were well done. Mine was assembled a bit cock-eyed so wire-cutters sorta work. I wish the pliers were a little springier. Cosmetically this knife looks good; functionally it leaves a lot to be desired.The knife-lock doesn't work or operate as advertised. They built the release of the rotating catch backwards so it is very easy for enough force to cause the knife to collapse.If you're buying one of these as a present for a teen or relative in good standing, consider spending a little more for something safer and better thought out, like a skeletool. If you're buying this for yourself and don't expect much, this is a very good buy."
4,grips were way to far apart,"this is a sharp looking tool and everything works well but the grips were wayyyy to far apart when gripping it. I have big hands so thats saying something. What I had to do was take my dremmel out and shave part of the metal stoppers that stops it from going all the way together. I took about 3mm off (on each side), it only took about 5 minutes. now it fits perfectly. it was so far apart it felt open while it was closed. I couldnt imagine having to open it up any further to grip onto something with the way it was. it was seriously uncomfortable. ill add pictures pointing out where I shaved the metal at. w/ before and afters"
5,Sliders is back,"I couldn't believe my friend when he told me that a sliders DVD was coming out. The first two seasons of sliders are the best by far with Quinn, Remmy, Wade, and of course the Professor. This cast worked perfectly together. It was very hard to see the professor and Wade leave as the seasons went on because the four of them made the show what is was when it was on FOX. Yes, do you remember that, the show started out on FOX.This DVD is definately worth your money. Hopefully in the near future we could see a movie out of this with the original cast. Keep up the support for Sliders!!"
2,Started out okay but jumped the shark early,"This started out as a fairly entertaining show, with plenty of humor, as befits its premise. But by the middle of the second season, it started taking itself WAY too seriously. In fact, it became downright dystopian, with an emphasize on violence and darkness. If there are limitless parallel worlds, it's hard to believe all of them are awful compared to this one! I finally gave up about episode 15."
5,okay,Exciting new science fiction for its age. The stars are uniques and work well together as a family. . .
2,Eh?,"This show had great potential. I only saw the pilot, so it was early in the development of the series. I loved the idea and the pilot was interesting, but it seemed underdeveloped in terms of production quality. That could also be due to when it was produced, some time ago."
4,Sliders,Bought these for our sons girlfriend for Christmas. She almost cried she was so excited. I have been told she has watched them a hundred times now. Loves them
5,Life as God created it to be,"This book has completely changed my view on knowing and following God's will for my life. At first it is easy to think that one needs to escape the life they currently lead and head for a remote location. But read on to find the real secret to ""hearing God's voice""."
5,Best book outside of the Bible I've ever read,"Have you been searching for something in your Christianity, but you aren't quite sure what? Well, ""Escape to God"" has the answer! I'm on my third time through, and I am finding more than I ever expected. The best thing is, it isn't theological and beyond the average layman's understanding. Even better, it's practical, not just theory. It gives real-life examples from the author's own life and the lives of those he knows. Jim is a personal friend of mine, and I can see how his has been changed by the revolutionary ideas he presents in the book. It works! It really works! This is a must-get book! [...]"
3,Uneven but worthwhile reading,"This book was recommended by a colleague and I found it quite fascinating. Perhaps even more so as we have embarked on a ""war on terrorism"" and nuclear strategies are being developed specific to certain countries forming the ""axis of evil.""It appears that most reviewers found the book worthwhile while a few found little in it of redeeming value. After reading Ambrose, this was certainly a departure. However, overall I found it an interesting perspective and one that is rarely heard.An occasional chapter is tedious, especially that on the London literary scene in the 40s. But Fussell through that information tries to show how some tried to maintain some semblance of normalcy during a period of great privation.Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone interested in a different perspective on WWII. It was, in some ways, similar to certain civil war histories that focus more on the travails of the soldiers than the strategists."
3,"Decent, but not great","The thing about a lot of the old good Face to Face songs is that they immediately stick in your head. Unfortunately, there are very few songs on this album that have that same infectious quality. It's not they're bad songs, it's just that they aren't memorable. I don't know, maybe this album will grow better as I listen to it more."
4,Arts & Crafts,I feel this book is more for parents at home trying to do arts & crafts with their children and it's pefect for that. I on the other hand teach toddlers and was looking for something a little different.
2,Pictures will help,"This book offers many good ideas for parents to do with their kids. I think it would be more helpful if it includes photos of the finished products. Even though I own this book, I usually go to crafting blogs or family magazines for arts and crafts ideas because they have photos of the process and finished products."
4,reference book,I purchased this book as a reference for beer trays and other beer related items to try to research values or items I have.
4,Replacement. It works nicely,We ordered this unit to replace an identical one. The rear sliders wore out after a year and are riveted on so are not replaceable. Other than that; mom really likes it.
1,ORBIT: FIX YOUR PRODUCT!,"In the software industry, they would call this a bug. In my opinion, this is a repeatable ""SHOW STOPPER""!! I had 3 of these with an Orbit 3 port manifold. All 3 of the valves leaked from BOTH SIDES and then I stumbled onto this thread [...] which basically stated the same problem. I tried a using the thread wrap a little bit, a moderate amount, a significant amount (as directed) and excessive amounts. All with results that were equal to Leaking! In regards to tight, I tried ""not to tight"", moderately tight and really tight. Also with the same results. Now I'm building my own. :o(If you question this review.....The instructions state to ""put 7-8 wraps of the plumbing tape to keep it from leaking. Trust me, when you get 7-8 full wraps on the threads, there's not much threads left over and even then it leaks. SHAME ON ORBIT!"
1,Doesn't look natural,"I'm not sure if only the brown color has this effect, but I bought this and tried it twice. The brush itself isn't very good. There's too much goop liner on it, and it smudges all over your eye as you apply it. It looks really fake, even when I tried a super thin line of liner. I don't know if there's a technique, but it doesn't look as normal as regular eyeliner. I haven't had a chance to see if it lasts all day because I couldn't leave the house looking like a freak."
3,coffee table book,"This is an excellent coffee table book full of pictures, pictures and oh yeah...more pictures. That's just fine I suppose-but one reviewer made the comment that it's a ""musical journey"" thus prompting me to buy the book. However, I didn't find it to be that exactly. Its a cheap, thin paperback photo album with small text paragraphs. For it to be ""a musical journey"", I would want it to have more text and more insight. To me that makes it more personal. I can watch Rattle and Hum on video and get a bigger buzz than thumbing through this coffee table book. Buyer beware. Buy the DVD of Rattle and Hum instead if you actually want to take a musical journey."
3,"good soup, too many dents","The photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can, there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found, unlike the cans I've bought from a local grocery store. I guess this must be a change in Wolfgang Puck's recipe but the photo on the can does not represent the contents anymore. Several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented, although none seriously. Packing with better filling could have prevented dents in transit."
2,article incomplete,"This would have been an interesting/useful article except that photographs/mapping/charts were not included in the printout.It's not clear if there were any in the original article, but at a certain point it was noted that some material had been excluded.Can't imagine who might be interested without any graphic material."
2,The P.I. & the Burgler could both retire with the author,"I've read all and every of Block's ""Mathew Scudder"" series, but it was a slowly burnt-out, downhill slides one by one, a deterioration from good, bad, worse to worst. The ""Burglar"" series actually is an unrealistic joke or farce, similar to the once-so-great Lawrence Sanders' alcholic, drunken ""McNally's"" series, cashed in by both authors with their old fames. Detour from these authors and save some money for those who still could write with enthusiasm and a heart."
5,"great price, great sound","My setup: Fluance AV-HTB,Pioneer VSX-819H-K 5-Channel A/V Receiver (Black), andPolk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Sub-woofer (Single, Black)Over all I'm very pleased with these speakers. I'm a bit of a audio novice, but to my ears these speakers sound great; crisp and clear even at high volume. Just to echo some of the other reviews opinions, solid construction and well packed for shipping. I've had these speakers for about 3 months and everything I've heard on them has just sounded amazing, perhaps the most striking I've noticed over my old HTiB is clarity. I've played blu-rays on this system and they've sounded great, and I'm especially impressed with how music sounds on these speakers."
5,Better than most,"Ok I am not an snobbish audiophile.I like good quality, but I am not willing to pay through the nose to get the absolute best since the wife and kids are usually making noise in the house so phenominal sound quality is drowned out by nagging and yelling from somewhere.I have these set-up with the following:Onkyo 606 receiverSony Blu-ray S570Xbox 360Samsung 1080p 120Htz TV from a few years back.I watch movies and listen to music and game on these and they do a great job. The price is a great incentive to getting them also.In the size room the speakers are in I don't require a sub-woofer.I had a grenade go off next to me in MW2 and the speakers rattled the house, the kid's and I got that mischievious grin on our faces...I was happy. The wife? She thought the kids were fighting in the family room and fell on the floor and wasn't happy... I was hooked.good quality sound, solidly built, but a little big if you want something that is going to blend into a room."
4,Not for beginners,"In general terms de book is excellent rigarding the stuff is talking (technology, weapons, accidents and so on). The book is not for beginners because has a poor introduction, few drawings explaining the layout of a submarine, machinery arrengements (specially items like: What for the MS-1 valve?), nothing about optics, how the obtain a fire solution is not well explained and there is no diagraman in orden to explain the faced problems, etc. For a person who has never heard about a submarine this is not your book though for people who is very enthusiat about the subjet this is definitely your book."
1,Aaarrrggghhh!!!!,"Well, I should have listened to the first reviewer. I also checked with the manufacturer (Valley), before purchasing, and was convinced it was the right thing. It's not. IT DOES NOT FIT!!! Amazon has since stopped selling this item - see their disclaimer. The box was destroyed in shipping to me, so I cannot even use it to ship it back. What a pain."
1,Misnomer,"While the Hindenburg, like the Phoenix of myth, did in fact perish in fiery death, it did not rise again from its own ashes reborn. Some would say that this rebirth part is the essential - defining, even - trait of the Phoenix. For this reason alone I cannot recommend this book."
2,"The value is good, the quality sucks","I've returned THREE pelican controllers back to the respective stores they came from including one exactly like this because of various problems. On one, the button broke. On another the digital thumb pad was wonky. The third was a used one, so maybe that doesn't count, but damn! THREE in a row bad of various model pelican controllers. My advice, buy a $12 Mad Catz if you are on a budget. Otherwise, spring $25 for the standard Nintendo GC controller. The Interact Starter Kits are OK for $20 IF you can find them since Interact went belly-up last year..."
5,"It's a film that proves the concept ""overwrought"" is the same in every language.","Reality and subtlety are the twin enemies of Bollywood, and here's Exhibit A: Anurag Basu's multilingual action-romance about an Indian stud (Roshan) who falls in love with the gorgeous Mexican fiancée (Mori) of his wealthy girlfriend's brother while in Las Vegas. (Got all that? Good.) Cribbing from countless Tinseltown efforts, this music-video-cum-perfume-ad is awash in excessively melodramatic flashbacks, car chases and references to the domestic illegal-immigration debate. It's a film that proves the concept overwrought is the same in every language.Great movie by Hrithik. Absolute stunning. Real superstar of Bollywood."
1,NOT What I Ordered,"Wolfgang Puck recently changed their Chicken soup. The old stuff is excellent. The new stuff is watered down, not filling and doesn't taste as good. The image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup. The soup I received is the new stuff. Being a food item, returns are not allowed. I feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased."
4,More chicken please!,"The soup itself was excellent -- a nice, well-tasting mix of meat, veggies and wild and white rices, but surely a few more chunks of chicken could have been added. I bought it at local grocer -- two cans for $4."
5,Sublime songs from a sublime singer!,I first came across Adrina Thorpe and her debut album Elusive on MySpace earlier this year and it has become one of my favourite albums since then. Adrina's strengths are manifold - she has a stunning voice which she uses well to perform her beautifully written songs. The songs on the album range from very tender ballads to up tempo pop songs which speak of life and a subtle spirituality. It's odd to come across an album without any filler tracks but Elusive is one of this rare breed. Every song is an attention grabber in its own way and leaves you humming the tunes in your head. Since I got Elusive it's been practically glued into my CD player and my Walkman. Can't wait for the next album! Very highly recommended!
3,way over-hyped,"i've been a hardcore fan of TAE since they first came out. never laughed as hard as i did watching their show. BUT... the movie was a bit disappointing. they need to stick to skits. movie dragged along on a boring premise. some funny moments, but too far and few between. as a true fan, I'm glad I supported them. I hope they resume TAEASGJ soon. on [AS], it was the constant random short clips that made them hysterical. i hope you boys come back home. come to TAEASGJ country. full scrim. and bring CHEF GOLDBLUM. btw, that was the funniest scene of the movie, unfortunately."
2,what the heck!,What has come of this world are we all 2 years old! This movie was a joke what a stupid movie i feel dirty just by watching this crap!
2,The Trailer Was Better,"Enjoyed the trailers, did not enjoy the finished product. Even free with a Prime membership we shut the film off halfway in. Rambles and doesn't really contain jokes. Wished it had been better, HOPED it would be better, did not find it 45 minutes in."
5,"Awesome Movie, Great job","Me and my friends sat down this evening to watch this super-hyped movie. We laughed, we cried(from laughing), we had the best weekend ever.This movie is for anyone with a sense of humor."
1,Comedy=Pain?,"I made it through 23 minutes and 25 seconds of this movie. Apparently a satire of Hollywood, it features piercings, fish hooks, and masturbation. I can see it getting nervous twitters from insecure individuals, but what I saw was simply gross and the limited nervous twitter factor didn't come anywhere near over-shining the gross. Yes, the male penis is a funny instrumentality, but I stopped laughing hysterically at it when I was 13. If you are going to go for the crotch, make it funnier. Overall rating: Admiral Akbar says ""it's a trap!"" This isn't a movie, it's an exercise in trolling."
5,Great job!,"I was skeptical about paying $9.99 for a 48 hour rental, but if you're a Tim & Eric fan it's definitely worth every cent! The regulars, the star power and the new comers all do an incredible job! I can't wait to watch it again. And then again when it's released in theaters!"
2,"2 stars for Wil Ferrel, otherwise it's crap.","I could only make it as far as 30 minutes before the movie ended before I couldn't make myself watch anymore. This movie made me feel like the actors were just there to collect a paycheck, and nothing more. It had it's ok moments but most of the movie for me at least was exceptionally painful and an assault on my brain. This is a great film for: Masochists and people who like to sit on the curb licking 9 volt batteries. But that's just the impression it gives me. Don't let my sacrifice be made in vain! You don't have to watch this, save yourself!!"
4,wonderful,"This adapter has made taking my son to the store, park and other peoples houses so much easier. He's 13 pounds at 10 weeks so carrying the car seat stopped being an option.Well made, easy to click on and off and lightweight this adapter has it all. I only gave it 4 stars because I ordered it through an Amazon seller and not Amazon itself. They took 2 1/2 weeks to get me the right adapter; having sent me the adapter for the Maxi and some Italian car seat first. They finally sent me the correct one and I insisted that they do 2 day shipping."
5,Great contemporary big band album!,This is the sort of contemporary big band recording that there simply aren't enough of. The tracks are all good with a variety of styles. Anyone who has played in a high school or university big band will likely get a great deal of enjoyment from listening to this album.
3,I just don't know,I just don't know about fancy salt. I bought a Peugeot Salt and Pepper grinder set and needed something to put into the Sale grinder..... This salt was very wet and didn't work. I tried drying it in the over and that didn't work. I don't like to give it a low rating because someone who knows salt may know better than I...
2,Not size packages I thought I ordered.,"When ordering these I understood the packages were 10 tissues in each package.When they arrived the ones on top were this size, but the ones below were packagesof seven. May husband still says this are the best tissues he has ever used, sothe small package is OK with him. I was disappointed in the size of package! Idid notice on this page that it shows the package of ten and states it is a package of."
1,Imagine treadmills - does not work.,"Bought this for my Imagine treadmill. It does not fit although it looks as though it would. It is too big in the middle. Found other reviews that it would not work on imagine models, I suggest not buying for this brand.It would really help if the seller would list all the treadmills supported not just the brand names because even if it does look right, it still may not fit."
4,Treadmill safety key,Safety key was fine...except I purchased treadmill without book and it was not the size I was looking for. I took a chance at the size so my own fault.
5,Wow!,I doubt that anyone can listen to this without tapping their toes! This is pure entertainment from start to finish.
3,Introductory ONLY...kind of thin but good for the newcomer,"I was a bit dissappointed with this book. Just that basics are covered and too much is left for the user to figure out later on. If I didn't know better, I would think that this is just a glorified promotional tool for the product. Also, this book is effectively out of print and I could not link to the company's website for any updates. I didn't bother to open the CDROM yet and will probably not keep this book for long since it really did nothing for me.HOWEVER: if you are a newbie to Cubase and desktop digital studio tech, this may be the book for you. It does a good job of simplifying and giving a user a well-rounded, basic overview of desktop studio technology and what it can do for you.I give it a ""medium"" rating."
3,"Book is good,lacks info on characters and shows","When I order a book on a certain subject,I expect it to give me as complete a synapsis as possible(including program guides on each of the shows). The most interesting shows,talked about were ""The Fugitive"" ""The F.B.I"" and ""The Streets of SAN FRANCICO"".The rest were just okey."
5,Kids love it too,"I have three children ages 11,12,14. Ever since this book came, there has been ""friendly fighting"" over it. Any fisherman should like it."
4,Just what it says -- works well,"This magic wand is a good value, with a fun whooshing sound and very bright blue light on the tip. It's made of hard, relatively heavy plastic, and feels pretty sturdy. It comes with batteries, which is helpful, since it takes they button-type. Basically, exactly what I was looking for, with sound as an added bonus. What would make a magic wand five stars? Maybe if it's made of wood, or used regular batteries, or had some interesting decoration."
2,Not pleased.,"When I purchased this wand, it was for use in a play for the wizard. I wanted it because the picture shows a nice white LED at the tip that could be used for fun effects. The wand came, and the LED is RED, not WHITE. It doesn't turn on while you are holding the button, and off when you release it, but instead it flashes a few times and turns back off, while making a ghastly noise. I am not pleased with this at all.I'm hoping I can open the wand up, cut the wires to the speaker, and replace the red LED for a white one.I should have just built one myself to begin with."
3,Not very impressive compared to other toy wands.,We didn't really like this wand. Doesn't look very great or work very well. But my daughters friend was happy to acquire it. We just gave it away because we didn't like it too much. But then it's a very basic wand for a very cheap price. And that's what you get in return.
3,It's worth a couple of buck,"just to have something that lights up. I have other Harry Potter wands, and carry them. This is going to be more for just playing with peoples heads. Ask em 'what do you want me to do? Pull out a wand and make it light up?' when they keep bugging you about something."
5,One Wild Ride,I love this dvd! All the stuff they couldn't show you on the tv show. Insane stunts like driving around in a car full of lit fireworks. This is the dvd equivalent of the book THE DISTURBED WRITINGS OF ADAM COCHRAN.
1,Terrible,"I am a HUGE fan of CKY series and even of the ""tamer"" Jackass stuff. This one was terrible and just went too far. Most of the time Steveo was totally tanked or burnt and could barely speak on camera. There was absolutely NO production value in this. If you like watching drunken frat boys get nude and do the pseduo-homesexual male rampage act we're all used to seeing at college keggers, then this is for you. Even the girls in these (who normally provide some sort of jiggly entertainment) came off as cheap drunk tarts better left as scenery.Otherwise, don't expect nearly the quality of the CKY series. I'll take Bam's stuff over Stevo anyday. Dude this [was bad]. I wish I hadn't paid so much to get these shipped here from my family back in Callie."
5,The Sound Of Galaxies Being Born,"holy F---! ambient drone metal goodness! think my bloody valentine meets sunnO))) Million Year Summer and We All Die Laughing are worth the price of admission alone. crank it loud, be enveloped in the washes of fuzz and go for the gooey melodic center. i cant stop listening. this is the sound of galaxies being born and dying. buy it NOW!"
2,Why?,"Why bother to get this album when you can listen to the original person? And with the popularity of CD Burners, you can compile your own ""best of"" disks (until anti copy technology takes hold).If the sample tracks here sound anything at all like the full album, then this sounds more to me like something I would expect to hear in a store playing over the Muzak system. While that may be fine if I am trying to put myself to sleep, I usually don't listen to music with that in mind. Stick to the original artists. It is a rare bird that can come along and make an original sound better."
4,"size is wrong, but other then that good",These are a little bigger then they say. But they serve their purpose and were a lot cheeper then the seat cushions sold at stores.
1,Very disappointed,"I can hardly find the words to describe the depths of my disappointment in this book of home plans. They seem generic, dull, insipid and uninspired--completely at odds with the title ""Grand Vistas."" I would not recommend this book to anybody who really wants a home that takes advantage of a great view."
4,Stresstabs,"Smart Care Stresstabs Tri-Amino Energy Tablets With B-Complex, + Iron - 60 TabletsGreat product! My Husband swears by this product."
4,Give First Place to Murder,It started off with a murder and each time I thought it was about to loose my interest another murder victim happened along and kept me interested. I like Kathleen Delaney's books. I am looking forward to more Ellen McKenzie Mysteries. I have read all the ones that she has written. She keeps my interest and has a lot of intrigue in her story lines.
5,Good Quality,"I like inositol in powder form because it tastes just like fructose and you can sprinkle it on food and mix is with juice. One less pill to take. This is a good quality product. I can actually feel it's effects (makes you sleepy at night) so I know it's ""for real""."
5,great!,I was surprised when we first got these - I wasn't expecting a tiny book (obviously didn't read the dementions closely) but it - as well as the others in the series - served to be a great book for those long car rides as they've gotten older & great entertainment (as well as compact) for the diaper bags! Who doesn't LOVE the veggietales?? I know our family does!
5,A Fascinating Journey,An excellent book for anyone with even a mild interest in shipwrecks. Great pictures and even maps. Great stories told of shipwrecks from every era. A great gift or coffee table book.
3,Too wordy,Author takes too many sentences to tell details that are not relevant to the story. Not yet finished with book
5,in memory of Virginia Hamilton,"I had the pleasure of buying the book ""Herstories"" from the author herself.It is a ""Must Have"" book if you've read any of her earlier books. Ms. Hamilton told me that many of the stories in this book came handed down to her.As you may already know, Virginia Hamilton died on February 19, 2002. ""Herstories"" is the perfet gift for those who want to keep her memories alive.The art work that Leo and Diane Dillon bring to the pages of ""Herstories"" is like nothing that you've ever seen in a childrens book - they make the stories come alive on the pages!Readers note: Please note that spell-check was not avalible to me as I was writing this review!"
4,Seneca Vocabulary,"This is a modern reprint of Albert Gallatin's nineteenth-century vocabulary of the Seneca Indian language. It is a very small volume, and there is no phonetic key. An interesting book from a historical linguistics persepective or if you'd like to learn a few words of Seneca, but don't buy it expecting to learn how to speak the language."
3,Inexpensive basic digital camera,"Depending on what you want to take pictures of you will either like it or hate it. Certainly the price is attractive and it's a tiny little camera that you can stick in your shirt pocket. You can take photos at 1.5, 3 or 5 megapixels. Without a memory card you can get between about 7 and 15 pictures in the camera depending on what level you set it at.There is no optical zoom so anything you take will be a basic long shot. It is lousy if you are sitting out in the bleachers trying to get photos of your favorite ball player but it's great if you are standing five feet away. Digital zooms just spread out the pixels, deterioriating the final product but it is no different than any other digital zoom in that regard.It is very sensitive. The slightest movement can blur the picture. So hold your breath when you snap your shot.Software comes with the camera so you can load pictures into you CD. They upload very easily."
1,Worth it for a city dweller who wants to go on a hiking vacation,"You get what you pay for. They are comfortable out of the box. The waterproof works for awhile, but they do not take a beating. The soles are not solid rubber. They are hollow and quickly fall apart with any type of extended wear - mine lasted a few weeks of serious hiking and now 5 weeks into hiking they are completely un-useable. The only thing between my heels and the ground is the waterproof lining and the piece of paper they have for insoles. If you are going on vacation and need some boots that need no working in to feel comfortable these are worth it. Do consider them disposable however."
3,I don't love it!,"Whew, guess I'm the odd ""man"" out here.......I'm disappointed in this address book. I find it awfully clunky. Yes, it's a spiral, but it doesn't easily lie flat. I guess I'll use it, too much of a hassle to return it, but there are a couple of others on Amazon that I wish I would've purchased instead."
4,The Croatan have fallen....,"Finally a book devoted to the Croatan! The tales of the brave who sacraficed themselves to the Eater-of-Souls. This book gives detailed, informative descriptions about the tribe, history, and present (if there is one). Basically required for anyone that is truly interested in the STORY of Werewolf, not just the hack-and-slash that so many make it.Very well written. Adds an great new avenues to both Werewolf history, and the White-Wolf universe in general.Find out; was their sacrifice worth it?"
5,Can't find better than these,"I've searched & searched all over for the perfect work pants. Tried several models & none of them feel, fit, or live up to these. They are very sturdy & comfortable for work. I keep coming back for more. God knows what I'll do if Amazon stop selling these!"
1,good shape but horrible merchant!!,"I purchased the pant first time on Nov 5 from ZarClothing.com for a price of $ 22.99 and an additional shipping cost of $ 5.00. I already own this style in brown and wanted to add a black one because I really like the style. Due to Hurricane Sandy the package never arrived. I got refunded.I ordered the pants again on Nov 28 from ZarClothing.com, same price as on Nov 5. On Dec 2 I got informed that the article is out of stock at the moment. I checked the homepage again and the pants are still only available at ZarClothing.com. The status is shown as 'in stock' but the price is suddenly $ 32.99 plus shipping. But it is the same size and color than the last two times.I do not think that ZarClothing.com is a reliable and trust able merchant. I would not suggest ordering from them."
5,Fun for everyone!,"We bought the Pacific Play Tents Safari Tent for our son's 2nd b'day and he absolutely loves it! He plays inside his tent almost everyday and loves to crawl through the tunnel repeatedly. Even my husband and I join in the fun and play with our son also. It's big enough for adults and toddlers to play in. We haven't tried it outside yet, but eventually will the next time we go on an outing to the park. It is worth the price for something that will last a long time."
3,Faust - 'Wakes Nosferatu' (Think Progressive),"'Wakes Nosferatu' is QUITE the intriguing peice of work,specially by a band like Faust.A total of six tracks with a running time of 72 minutes.This is more or less Faust's tribute/salute/whatever... to the classic 1922 vampire film 'Nosferatu'(aka Dracula).The two cuts that I liked the most are the opener,the twenty-one minute ""Aufbruch Nach Rumanien"" and the heavily experimental ""Telepathia"".But,then again the entire disc is experimental and believe me,THAT'S an understatement.Not by far the best Faust release,but knowing how bands are anymore,that's easily understandable.If you're an old Faust fan,you should have no problem with 'Wakes...' but if you're a new/er Faust fan,you might want to get their 2-on-1 CD release of 'Faust/So Far' first and work your way forward."
4,"Interesting, historical guide to Barbizon evolution","Well thought out and intersting progression of the Barbizon school and its influence on impressionism, and the art world at large. Compelling historical account for the non-art lover as well."
3,"Very Funny, clever business novel, but...","This is a very funny comic book of a novel, complete with hysterical charts and graphs of the characters high and low points. Many details of business meeting are bound to strike chords with those us who walk those corridors. But the whole book is set around one huge deal, and the author takes the easy way out and never gives us any idea what the deal it, or what the business issues actually are. That would be like setting Catch-22 in an unnamed war for an unmamed country. The result is that the book looses much potential verisimilitude, and becomes nothing more than a clever comic book. But a very clever one, so read, enjoy, just don't expect too much."
1,More boring than a board meeting,"I love Stanley Bing's columns in Fortune but couldn't finish this awful book. Rather, I finished it where he should have."
5,Great Bike Carrier!,We have used the carrier 3 times and it has worked wonderfully. The bikes are very secure and the anti sway feature does keep the bikes from swaying back and forth. The carrier is very sturdy. I would recommend this carrier to others.
2,Read the Classic,"I'd recommend reading Charles Sheldon's ""In His Steps"" before reading this. Then you decide who is the better writer and has a real handle on the concept."
1,Not my first choice....,"This book is not a good one for ""Introduction"" to Programming using VB. My opinion obviously, but I find the book to draw way too many assumptions about what the reader already knows about VB. Reading this text I find myself re-reading over and over again the concepts that I am supposed to learn. The author throws out several concepts, definitions and terms all within one sentence. It is difficult to digest. Have a pen ready with lots of ink- you will have to make your own notes to make sense of it. I have only read 130 pages and was forced to buy another text to fill in the gaps. Too bad- the other text is quite good (Murach's Beginning VB) but this is not the book used for my class. There are a billion examples- for me the approach that works best is type out every example and just study it with the help the other text, websites and online help. Perhaps is this is the best way to get it done- but I personally feel learning this way is too labor intensive."
5,This is a Great beginner Book,"Yes this may noot have all you need , but if you are teaching a course in VB this is an exceelent book to use. I also like it for people who want to teach themself vb programming. I have worked as a programmer/instructor for over 10 years and have used this authors books in previous editions, it is great for beginners. There are tons of hands on exercises you can have your studnets try"
4,A good buy overall,"The watch is classy looking. The numbers are not as bold as I would have expected for an easy-read face, but I do like having numbers rather than symbols. The band is very large and I had to take out several links to make it fit my 6-inch wrist. I like the safety buttons on the clasp, but the clasp is wide enough that it is hard to center on a small wrist. I was able to get it to fit my wrist comfortably and I think it is a nice looking watch for the price."
4,"Nice, classic time-keeper","Needed an inexpensive watch for an upcoming trip and this seemed to fill the bill. I like the large face, the practical two-tone design, and the lighted dial. It is a little heavier than I expected and, like most, I had to have a number of links removed. (I did try to do this myself but ended having it done by a jeweler for $5.) The large ""fold-over"" clasp still makes it a little uncomfortable. For someone with a small wrist like mine, it might be better to choose one with an expansion band or strap."
2,"Watch for a Giant, not a woman's wrist!","I wanted to love this watch and I do think it is very attractive but,it is so huge that it went half way up my arm in the clasped position.I would have removed links, but the screws are so small, a gnat would have to do it with a gnat sized screwdriver! Some took theirs to a jeweler(I guess they have gnat sized screwdrivers), but why should I pay even more to own this watch? So, I have no choice but to return it. Why couldn't they make it easier to remove links when they design them and why did they use King Kong's wrist to size the band?"
5,Plain beautiful *,This watch is absolutely gorgeous! My husband took out 3 extra links and it was perfect for me! ..I wanted a watch to wear with gold or silver and this came up pretty handy =] I just love the light...easy to read #s and it doesn't look cheap at all yeah!! looks just fantastic..I like a lot you can tell lol.
5,An attractive and practical watch,"This is a watch that is very functional for everyday use. For the money, you cannot beat it. It is easy to use whether in the shower or swimming, and handy to see in the middle of the night or in a movie. Goes with anything and is easy to put on and take off."
1,ripe off,i hate this doll and dont bye this doll for your child it is a bad doll its ugly and it makes a huge mess when it pottyes it is a ripe off i hate it and i am 9
1,Disappointed due to lack of diversity availability...,"for this doll. I've just order this doll, but will be returning it. Due to this doll not being offered as an African American, or for other ethnic races; and, after reading many enlightening reviews at this and other sites, I've decided not to give this doll to my daughter @ Christmas."
1,Save your money,"We bought this doll and actually thought she was broken. Returned it and got another one, same problem. It is so hard to feed her and to make her cry you have to squeeze her arm...really hard! Not something you want you child to learn. She comes with a potty but it is equally hard to get her to go. The food is impossible to feed to her, but even harder to get out so it won't mold.Uncomfortable baby to hold and not very cute to look at. Go for a soft baby and they have cheaper drink and wets if that's what you are looking for."
4,Interesting read,"I enjoyed the read. The story of a disfunsional family dealing with lifes day to day issues. Few things shocked me, but did overall enjoy the book."
2,Great subject ruined by poor writing,"This book and subject matter could have been a lot more enjoyable if it were not for the horrible writing style of the author.This book is proof that anyone can get published if you 'know someone in the biz'.If you can get past the bad writing, the subject is entertaining. The first chapter, on sex, is not for the easily offended! Straight from the hip talk about something the Romans apparently enjoyed very much!I don't get the need to write an 'apology' chapter. After all, isn't anything historical going to be a rehash of what others have already written, but from a different point of view??The map was cool. So was the glossary.If you want info on the Roman Emperors, you'd find better luck with a different author."
3,A good value for a no frills product,"I made this purchse based almost exclusively on price with the only criteria being I needed this style of headphone (I can't use ear buds, or anything in-the-ear) and prefereable in the $5 range.The product works fine and sounds good but isn't the most confortable. The plactic piece that goes over the ear is very cheaply made and can be uncomfortable as time progresses.All in all, I needed something functional and inexpensive, which these are. I wish that instead of including interchangeable color caps that they invested in a better over the ear clip."
4,It was GREAT!!!,This book was really good. It made me cry at the end. I suggest you read it right away!!
5,Great Map!,Great map! Very detailed and easy to use. Be sure to get the free ones that that the city gives out also. They are in every hotel lobby. Combined with this map you shouldn't get lost.
2,Great glove for the money but not durable at all,"I purchased this glove for co-ed slowpitch softball. I am a pitcher so I ""touch"" the ball often. I wanted a larger glove to field more of the line drives hit near the mound. I used this glove in four, seven inning games and during the fourth game the metal piece that the strap slides through and tightens the glove around your hand snapped off. It is a design error with the flimsy metal piece to pull on and tighten your glove. I loved this glove while I was able to use it but I have since returned it for a refund."
4,CHANhigh Noon,"There's not much for me to say about this book. The title and the author tell it all: it's the exciting story of one the most incredible stuntmen in movie history! The book is written in a style that is engaging and very often hilarious. It is, however, somewhat confusing, because Jackie's narration does jump around in time quite a bit, so you might lose track (a little) of what happened before what. Also, it would have been helpful if he had told us how old he was at the different stages of his life; that would have helped to better keep track of his story. Nonetheless, the single most important fact remains; this book is about Jackie Chan. And that's more than enough reason to keep you entertained."
5,Phenomenal,"Rarely is a biography able to authentically capture the experiences of a man's life as well as I Am Jackie Chan is able too. From start to finish, it accurately describes Jackie's beginnings, from his youth, to his education, to his rise to fame. From his Relationships, to his gambling problems, to his fame-filled life in the end, the book is an amazing read. Along with giving the reader an insight into Jackie Chan's personality and life, it also gives an amazing look at Sammo Hung, fellow famous martial artist and director. Along with overviews of all his films, his best fights and his best stunts, this is the must-have book for Jackie Chan fans."
4,"Good condition, arrived just as advertised","Great read about an interesting guy. My daughter did a school project on him and used the biographical details to fill in her report and presentation. Came when seller said it would, in time to be useful for the project."
4,A Sobering Look at the Drunken Master,"""I Am Jackie Chan"" will be as entertaining to newcomers as it is enlightening to long-time devotees. It provides the most detailed account yet of his early Peking Opera school years (accounting for roughly half the book), glimpses at his significant romantic relationships, and details his rise to stardom in Asia and later, America. While touching on Chinese culture, life in Hong Kong, and the influence of triads on HK movie-making, we witness Jackie's journey from his background of poverty and illiteracy to becoming an internationally known actor, filmmaker, singer and philanthropist. Though Chan is a notoriously private man, he offers some of his mistakes, ego trips, heartbreak, and regrets as well as triumphant moments. Fun and inspiring, this book is the most personal insight into Jackie Chan's life and persona yet seen."
3,order smaller size,"I liked the shoes, the velcro is behind the ankle vertically. It is easy to slip on baby feet. I like the material and colors. Colors are exactly like the picture. Just make sure to order a size smaller. There is little support on the bottom. I would recommend thick socks."
3,Very cute but run TOO big,I loved these cute little booties but they are WAY too big. My baby is 3 1/2 months old....and is wearing a size 1. I ordered a size 2 but they are so big she will not be able to wear them before the weather changes. The are great quality and the color is true to the picture.
3,Darling and well made but stiff,"These slippers are adorable and sweet, and beautifully made. The only problem is, I believe the baby will need soft socks that stay up, to wear inside the slippers. The slippers are quite thick leather, and quite stiff. I'm worried they will rub on the baby's ankle/leg area and chaffe. We'll see."
1,Color problems,I ordered these booties because I really liked the light pink color of the boots. But what I received is dark pink which is completely different than the product image. I am totally disappointed. The images of the product shared here are deceptive.
2,Cute but poorly designed,Booties are not made for infants. They are not ergonomically correct and do not consider the width and thickness of most babies' feet.
1,Disappointed,We were looking for little boots for my granddaughter to wear. These are unlined and more like moccasins than boots.
1,Totally out of date - don't buy,"The copy write on this book is 1993 of a revised addition of 1985. For example, talks a lot out brochure mailing and little about Internet marking. There are better and newer books on the subject. Also I am having a problem getting a refund form Amazon's affiliate Kinley 10."
3,Engineer boots,The would be great boots if I could get them on my feet easier. Quality of the boot is very good but not easy to put on.
1,Printing Error,Book arrived quickly. When looking over the cover I noticed the cover had many white ink marks that indicated it was printed poorly. Opening the book I found all the even (left-hand) pages to be incorrectly printed. The right margin and bottom margin are missing 2-3 characters from both. The odd pages (right-hand) suffer from missing characters on only the bottom margin.User-Centered Web Site Development: A Human-Computer Interaction Approach
1,Belt closure defective,"I ordered two of these packs and both of them have had the same issue - after one or two uses the closure on the belt part locks closed. It nearly had to be cut off; I was finally able to enlarge the belt to the point where it could be slipped off over the hips. Frustrating, to say the least!"
3,Not a Two Mix Pan,"This pan looks great, and is just the shape I wanted. However, the instructions and product packaging state that the pan uses THREE 2-layer cake mixes. That's a lot of cake. There's no other pan that I've found like it, so I'm keeping it. But plan for a big cake if you order this product."
1,Waste of Money,"Lesson learned: read and believe reviews before making a purchase. The book is entertaining in places, but filled with inaccuracies and opinions instead of facts. It is very simplistic and poorly edited."
1,"DANGEROUS to kids: has a creepy ""nice"" kidnapper!","This was a DISTURBING video, to say the least! The Toy Taker (dressed in a dark trenchcoat) steals toys by lying to them and telling them that he will love them -- that their owners/children don't take care of them like he will. He consoles a sad doll by giving her flowers and a handkerchief. She decides to go off with him. This scenario could easily translate to a child snatcher! Later, the Toy Taker turns out to be a rejected teddy bear who returns the toys and everything turns out happy at the end -- thus, justifying the bear's snatching. HOW DO WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN NOT TO GO OFF WITH ""NICE"" STRANGERS, IF THEY SEE JUNK LIKE THIS? I'm going to contact everyone I can to complain about this creepy video!"
1,Amazon should warn buyers that this is not the original !,"After reading all of the other people who were led to believe this was the original (the Grinch who stole Chtistmas they sell was original), you think Amazon would put one line in to alert buyers.I guess it's buyers beware."
3,THE KIDS SHOULD LIKE IT,"This animated entry in the ever-growing Rudolph series should please the kiddies, but adults may find it a little hard to sit through. This time the impish Rudolph finds himself battling the Toy Taker, a mysterious entity that goes around stealing all the toys in an effort to ""protect"" them from their selfish and abusive owners. Of course, when the Toy Taker makes off with Santa's toys, it's up to the red nosed caribou to save the day. The songs as usual are pretty forgettable and the main voice actors are merely adequate. Richard Dreyfuss is the snowman narrator; Jamie Lee Curtis is the Hungarian accented hippo, Queen Carmella and Rick Moranis is the Toy Taker. If you like to spend December watching any Christmas movie you can, this one certainly isn't a dud, it's just not that memorable."
1,Copying Pixar!!!!,Oh my gosh this is very bad I watched the commercial for this on tv and I was torn inside that they were gonna do a sequel to the 1960's classic give me a break this looks very corny who ever thought of the idea must of wanted to copy all of Pixars films like 1995's Toy Story 1998's Bug's Life 1999's Toy Story 2 and 2001's Monsters Inc. please get the 1960's original version and don't get this it isn't a good holiday flick believe me if you rent this you will know what I mean and I don't think kids will like this either. please don't get this I'm warning you :( not happy
1,Don't let the title fool you...,"Be sure to read the fine print on this one. I was led to believe I was purchasing the original Rudolf, what a surprise when I got it home. This movie just plain stinks. There is no story line to keep a viewer interested. My young son paid no attention at all. If you like the old stop motion films, definitely leave this one at the store."
4,My kids LOVE this movie!,"I'm alittle confused on some of the reviews for this movie. Some of the reviews were made before this movie was released and some are of the original Rudolph. Anyway, I was a little skeptical at first when I started to watch this ""sequel"" . I was sure I wasn't going to like it but to my surprise it was quite enjoyable. The computer animation looks great and you will find almost all the old characters in this movie except Sam. They tried to use voices that sounded like the original characters and they even have a couple catchy songs. My kids just love it. They have already watched it numerous times. They love seeing these familar faces in a new movie. I still prefer the original Rankin/Bass Rudolph but this is a very cute movie that all kids will enjoy."
4,Kids like it - NOT as good as original Rudolph...,"We rented this movie from the library and my granddaughter had to have it... My daughter and I agree that it is not even close to being as good as the original Rudolph movie, however, my grandkids love it. I guess it's something different for them?? Good movie, cute - would probably recommend."
2,A little under impressed,"Although I was engaged throughout the book it seemed like I knew what was going to happen next. Then I realized it was because I had seen Kurosawa's Yojimbo. Read it beacause it's part of the series, but don't expect too much to happen to further the story line throughout the saga. Nothing of any importance happens to Kaneka. The story of Shahai and the 8 Oni is nowhere to be found. Nothing happens to the empire or the other winds. It almost seems like this was a side road not a real book in the series. Like I said, under impressed."
2,Not worth the money - boardline rip-off,"It was very disappointing. My son is a huge fan of Ben Ten and Hyperscan makes a Ben Ten game. The game comes with scanner cards to be scanned in at various points in the game. However, they include only 6 and there are more to be purchased seperately. Although they tell you that the game can be played and completed with the cards included, during the game they tell you to scan in the cards you don't have. My son felt cheated by this.The game does not have good control so you really need good coordination to make it work smoothly - even adults have had trouble.Save your money for a PS2!"
2,Disappointing R/C Car,"TheRemote Control 1967 Ford Mustang GT RC Car 1:24 Redis disappointing. I remember 1967 Mustangs when they were new cars and this model has only a superficial resemblance to the real thing. But that's not the biggest disappointment.Let's start with the packaging. It actually takes a screwdriver and the removal of three screws to free the car and remote controller from its cardboard box. I can't imagine why it was packaged this way. After going through that, you have a car and controller both of which look and feel like the cheaply made plastic items they are. The r/c does not even have an on/off switch.The included directions are not useful. Fortunately, the controls are easy to use and the car, which makes an annoying grinding noise, will go forward and back at a reasonably fast speed and can be made to turn by using the little steering wheel on the r/c."
2,Not what I thought..,"Good price but not a very good driving toy. Its never aligned even though it was a function on the bottom of the car that you can fix but even then it still not very good.I would consider this for a baby who doesn't care about driving straight. The image in the picture it shows a baby blue colored mustang, Mine came in red which is no big deal but I though I was getting the blue one.Also it comes in a very hard to get out box. Basically you have to put in allot of force to rip the toy out the box or just used a ultra small screw diver.Really, All I wanted was a cool fast looking car but this one has been sitting in my dresser. Not much fun."
1,Good for the British Isles.,"This is yet another book relevant to Great Britain but being sold in North America without any warning that its information is largely irrelevant here. The idea behind a wildflower meadow instead of a lawn is to be promoted anywhere. But the species suggested for planting and the animals that will visit them to not make sense to the American reader. Many of the suggested wildflowers are in fact invasive weeds in North America. Even the style of meadow design lacks imagination. This is probably a good book for readers in Europe, but will mostly frustrate the American who wants to create an environmentally responsible wildflower meadow. Surely for serious North Americans there are better books describing how to create natural spaces."
5,Excellent Mix of Styles.,A great new artist to watch for. It's a shame more people outside the D.C. metro area and recording studios haven't heard of him. Keep up the good work...the music is great!
1,Clear your mind then come.,"I live in the desert and have for years. It is not a place of ""emptiness and death"", it is not a good place for crying and there is nothing particularly Christain about it. If you come to the desert with preconceived notions, if you attempt to overlay the desert with your with your existing mental framework, if you know how the world works before you get here you're going to miss everything. The desert is an exciting and dynamic place but it's not an Eastern Forest, your perception must change. If you could see the desert after rain, if you could feel the promise of night at sunset in the summer you would be thrilled not saddened. If you could watch the Cactus Wrens play you would know. The desert night is a wonderful place, even in the summer, when you step into a dry desert wash you can feel the coolness. Step into the arroyo."
1,this is a java book in disguise,"I bought this book, much to my chagrin, because I had looked at the Java one which FYI is a verbatim copy of this one. All the author did was translate the examples from Java to C. This was done in a very poor fashion I might add. He attempts to duplicate the object orientedness of java with straight c (no c plus plus). So instead of using a standard parse tree and symbol table, he invents this cockamamie type of tree structure using very java-esque structures. Anyway my recommendation is if you are looking for a Compiler book in C then this is not your book. If you are looking for Java, then you might as well get the java version of this guys book. My personnal recommendation is to get the dragon book."
3,Lasted but two years,"I have this dryer but it's currently mounted to my wall, unused, because it burned out after two years of mostly daily use. Still, I love the style and plan to get another one."
4,"Fast, efficient drying and styling. Sometimes gets a bit hot due to lack of medium heat setting.","Fast, efficient drying and styling. Sometimes gets a bit hot due to lack of medium heat setting."
2,Beware,"Bought 2. One got so hot it started to melt itself, was unsafe. Am trying to return it, they will get back to me in a week. Second is OK"
3,Broken fan blades after 15 months,"Bought this for my wife, who liked the product until three of the plastic fan blades broke after 15 months of use. Most likely just one broke off, and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking. Now the dryer is worthless. The warranty was for one year, so no luck there, and replacement parts cannot be found. Maybe 15 months is OK for a hair dryer at this price point, I don't know. I'm buying another, and hope it breaks in under 12 months this time."
4,Caramaniac,"Dragon Bones is a well balanced novel. Does it follow the template that alot of the genre does? Yes. But so what. You read the genre because you like it. If you are looking for something mind blowingly new.. this is not it. But if you are looking for a really good read that I would consider a great ""meat and potatoes"" addition to the fantasy genre.. Buy the book.SPOILER: Stop reading if you dont even want a hint about structure.Bones can be read as a stand alone. The plot comes full circle and you can walk away from the Dualogy at the end if you so choose."
4,For Opera Fans Everywhere...,"This is the only children's book I have found that introduces them to the wonders of the opera at a level that they can comprehend. In this world of insane pop stars with loose morals, it is so refreshing to see farm animals on a quest for a higher form of entertainment.It is so appropriate that the author chose the hog as the main character, an animal who is both extremely intelligent and well-padded, like most successful opera singers. Seeing these fat porkers with their oversized grins and popped-out eyes prepares the young child for what they will see at a real opera.My husband Earl of course totally disagrees with me. HE thinks this is a book meant to prepare boys for getting their first Harley motorcycle, and the fact that they MISS the opera is ""the whole dang point of the book, Martha. None of those hogs wanted to make it on time"". He thinks the plot is how to AVOID the opera, but what does he know? He can't even find his underpants in the morning."
4,A Nice Shirt,"This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy & comfortable."
4,"warm,yet evasive","the disco groove is evident only up to the point when the listener is made aware of the underlying techno ethic, the majority of the rythmns tread that fine between warmth and darkness, aptly comprised of the better angels of the two elements -not scary music to the ear, rather to the mind in it's ability to charm you, unknowingly-"
1,400 bucks!?!?,I bought mine for a hundred bucks a year ago. I sincerely feel bad for anyone who pays 400 bucks for this thing. Wasn't bad when it came out....but its been outdated for years.
5,Oh Wow!!!,I really loved the hero and heroine together. They had such great chemistry and it showed so well throughout the whole book. Her dad was a piece of work. I would hate him forever. I do love Simon and Megan though. They were a perfect match.
5,Great for Young Professionals,"I recommend this book to all of the other twenty-something female professionals who are struggling to be perfect for their bosses, families, friends and partners all at the same time. It is impossible, and it was great to read that I don't have to be Superwoman! I'm preparing to get married, and this helped me look at my life and see how I want it to be. It has also helped me find my own definitions of success and happiness. The book is easy to read and fun to talk about with girlfriends!"
4,Apples & Oranges - Dawn Till Dusk ...,"Jan Clausen wrote a very intellectual and profound moving book especially for this very book, Apples & Oranges. I am very moved by the depth of feelings in which Jan Clausen described herself and her experiences. The character development is a real suspense and this book gave me thrill and also could have helped people who are in search of their sexuality. Moreover, I really could not get my hands of the book, and if I could, I would read it from dawn till dusk. A real life experience full of colours of life which brought an aspect in my real life. Very Good !"
4,Fun to use but be careful of the ribbing,"This has been fun to use but the ribbing at the base of the large arm can irritate certain sensitive body parts if you are not super careful and use PLENTY of lubricant... The Aneros (the model without the ribs) is a better design, although it is not motorized...but the best device is the Prostate Massager by Quanta Technologies which is motorized (WOW! Hold on because this will give you a wild roller coaster ride!!) and there are no ribs to irritate you"
1,I don't get it.,"This item was made of plastic that was too hard to enjoy. Either I am built differently than this design was intended for, or it is just not something I enjoy. I have a cheaper unit that is made of a softer surface material that creates a decent sensation. This feels like a rock. I feel like I spent a lot for nothing."
2,Does not look new,"The bulova watches are really good quality, but when a got this one it seemed that they took the watch that they were showing to everybodie in the store traing to sell it. The watch came full of stripes, so it made me fell that was not brand new"
3,too heavy for me,"The design looks cool. But the body and belt of this watch are both made of high-density stainless steel. Therefore it is kind of heavy, definitely heavier that it looks. I was looking for a much lighter one. I returned it right after I tried it on my wrist."
4,"Nice Watch, Inexpensive Price, Expensive Look","I love this watch! i Purccased it from a local jewelry store, and i managed to get the sales rep to come down to $150 after I haggled for a few minutes, but the price listed at $165 is a good price as well. I love the brilliant finish, the band sparkles like platinum when you first get it. It will fade quickly, but a soft polishing cloth will restore the shine as good as new after a minute or two. The clasp is a hidden clasp, so all you see is the band, and no locks or clasps are visable. It kind of folds into itself locking in the middle. The face is curved and not flat across the dial, but it has a sort of convex appearance that seems to blend seemlessly into the band. I wear it not at work, because i type, and I noticed the underside of the band got a little scratched, so i save it for when i go out,I got atleast 4 or 5 compliments on it the first week I bought it. I would recomend it highly as a dress watch, not an every day watch."
1,Mediocre Joplin collection,"As the other reviewer mentioned, this is just piano notes pumped out thru a midi, not from piano rolls or a player piano. While it does sound like a piano and not a video game, it is a very pedestrian interpretation of Joplin's greatest hits."
2,Cornwall Can Do Better,"Not really up to what I've come to expect from Cornwall. A retelling of the Arthurian legend, but not one that I find riveting. Most of the characters are a little TOO flawed for my taste. I'm just not buying Guinevere as a worshipper of Isis. I do like Nimue, though. Singularly unattractive, but believable."
3,poor child!,"The first one, the Winter King, I did like more, but it was OK. There was only one matter, that did disturb me: the way Derfel and the others treated Mordred. How should a child, which has no parents, gets no love but is hit all the time become not a very very bad grown-up? I do not know if Cornwell has children, but I do hope not. Apart from this, it was a good book. A very interesting way to tell this story."
4,Arthur Book,"This is one of the best adventures in Arthurian myth, the Arthur books by this author. I was able to rent it at a local library. Involves more political intrigue than children's fantasy. Most Arthur film adaptions have gotten an R rating."
5,Can't get enough,"Along with being an incredibly talented, gifted song writer - balladeer Bob Cheevers easily commands his custom made Martin guitar to sing in perfect harmony with his ever so clear, silky gravel voice. Cheevers sings with pure passion and raw emotion. I found myself hanging onto every word in these short stories of truth, hope, love, and dreams. Wonderful stories of lives lived From Texas to Tennessee. You'll find ya just can't get enough of these small chapters presented brilliantly in song. Don't limit yourself to this CD alone. I also highly recommend his Gettysburg to Graceland CD. In fact I highly recommend his entire collection!"
2,disappointing,"I picked this up since it was one of only two guy-oriented wedding books I could find at the bookstore. There are a few helpful pages in here, especially for those of us that haven't been to a lot of weddings and need a refresher on the different traditions and customs of weddings. So, you get some helpful reminders (who to thank, etc.), but I think the author's attitude is pretty old-fashioned and to some people, could indeed be offensive. His ""right of first refusal"" theory -- let your fiance do all the work, but retain a right of ""first refusal"" where you can override her decisions seems like a recipe for disaster. At least, when I jokingly read those passages to my fiance, she was NOT amused."
1,Linux is definitely not what it's cracked up to be,"Now that my anger of linux is past, be weary of install. Although the user guide says that partitioning of the system is a breeze, and will try to find a resonable option with current versions of Windows, do not trust it! This is my first attempt at linux (although I have read up on it and gotten to know a bit about it), and SuSE Linux definitely has become the deterrent of switching from Windows to Linux. After all of the supposed hype, it seems more like a psych. My vote is a thumbs down."
4,Geometry made easy and understandable,"If there is such a thing as a math textbook that explains applications to real-life situations and makes it so the reader can understand, then this is it."
3,"Sex, Money, Sex, Power, Sex, Taboo, and more Sex",Good writting ability doesn't overpower that this novel is primarily written to sell people with the sex. Otherwise and half interesting half mundane story about a man's life as he struggles to gain power and money.
3,Head's up!,Head's up! This is volume I. I got the impression this was volume II from another review.
2,i hate the 4/4 thump,Yes - i hate the 4/4 thump that you can hear in the majority of tracks here. Also the bpm is too fast for me - it is just a question of taste. I am a slow person. I prefer music with a more relaxado andamiento. This is why i like the songs of Depeche Mode in their album Ultra.If you have any feedback please do not hesitate to contact me atcarlogiova@yahoo.itThanks.
1,Forget about this,"It is slow, has a dated looking user interface, no meaningful applications but it has a bunch of 'bloatware' about 2 gigs or more or thereabouts. Whoever gives this a five star review either do not use this operating system or has never purchased and installed it. To sum it up, I purchased the Windows XP Professional, it actually as some meaning behind it and it does not take up the entire hard drive."
1,Dont waste your money,"Well my advise is to save some frustration and get Red Hat instead. I bought this one and repeadedly tried to install the mysql package that was included. Well after trying many times and not having it work, I tried Red Hat 9 and suprisingly the same things that I tried and didnt work with SUSE suddenly worked just fine on Red Hat. I do admit im new to Linux but I do know when something works and not and Red Hat actually works as advertised."
1,From bad to worse with linux,"For starters trying to configure hardware in linux is like having dental work done without numbing medication. If you like typing then this is for you, command line like went out 10 years ago. What is so great about typing commands to install software? It is a major pain and most of it does not work or you have to be a scientist to make it work.Lastly, I wasted my money on this software, only to spend MORE money purchasing Windows XP Professional what I should have done in the first place. ARRGG one side note, linux wiped out my windows partition...."
1,Nicky Epstein's Knitted Flowers,There were several typo's or errors in the instructions which would have caused many problems for inexperienced knitters. My classroom teacher had to alter the given pattern instructions in order for our flowers to turn out correctly. I would not recommend this book.
5,I can't get enough of Nicky Epstein,This book is not only beautiful but all the flowers are well done and pretty easy to make. A great way to ad fun and wimsy to sweaters/bags and even use for a jacket accessory.I look forward to her next book.
3,fair cd,"3 tracks on this cd & that,s it.Fame being 1 of the wonderful tracks on this cd. I would,nt rush out buy a cd for only 3 excellent track,s I really wouldn,t."
4,Great Resource,"I just gave my copy of ""The Dog's Guide to New York City With Jack, The City Dog"" to a friend who is moving to Manhattan with his Lab.I lived in New York for 18 years, 8 of those years with 2 dogs. When I got Jane Rohman's book, the first of its kind that I had seen, I realized that there was so much more to know and do.The book is filled with fun things to do with your dog. It's a great resource for dog owners, a fantastic book; I wish they would update it."
5,Wise and organized,"Amazingly open and honest description of all phases of perimenopause and the different levels of ""cure"". I had borrowed this book from the library, but found I wanted to own a copy of my own to refer to when needed. I also bought a copy for my friend who is joining me on this next journey! I have found it quite helpful already, and am just beginning to need it! Organized by symptom which is a real time-saver!"
2,Too unscientific for me...,"This book was an interesing read. I agree with the authors that the medical community is doing a disservice to women by trying to ""cure"" menopause. Nonetheless, I am very skeptical of this book's remedies. Some of these herbs may have real value. Before women start using these ""remedies,"" I think they should wait until valid scientific studies show the usefulness and safety of herb remedies."
1,"Cry Baby, says Whaa?","I just wanted to cry some. Doesn't your blue ray player rock? This won't work though,whaaa. But thank someone, for not letting the idiots market some upscale version we all know is nothing more than the upscaling any $20 machine does today, goo goo goo. But it still is available in VHS for the little bit of 3rd world in all of us I guess.Why not redirect the whole movie with HD cameras and give some of these new actors a chance? This time no more Batman effects to cheat with the fuzzy technology.I can remember this movie as good, but the above made it boring. Why did god or nature give us eyes if not to see?"
4,Good Stuff,"Well acted by the cast, this movie doesn't have any flat spots. One of the appeals of the moive is the small scenes that though not essential to the plot give a sense of time and purpose."
4,Great fun!,"Great rousing story of heroism and sacrifice with scenes of nobility, cowardice, and redemption. Required viewing for my boys...."
5,Rough Riders,"Thought it was an outstanding FILM, good action scene's but also very funny in places, defiantly recommend this film to others."
5,easy install,"I just put in 3 of the Silhouette styles in my house, along with one of the combo units that is smoke and carbon monoxide, and one kiddie wireless unit hardwired in along with 2 of the wireless units attached to the hardwired wireless unit.My old units were 8 years old so all wire plugs needed to be changed out, to match the new units plugs. The new plug sets came with the units making changing all 3 style units that were hardwired in easy and fast to install. As long as you can shut down the power to your smoke alarms, and match red with red, white with white, and black with black and attach the wires with a basic wire nut you can change each unit in 5 minutes or less."
1,Unit did not work.,The product purchased from Amazon did not work when installed. Had to contacted Kidde about the product and they sent me a unit that worked when installed.
5,LOVED,This book is the most amazing book I have ever gotten to further my relationship with God. I didn't do it in a group as it suggests but it was still an amazing tool. It taught me a lot of things that before reading it I wasn't paying attention to. What the book helped me do can be summarized by the title. It literally helped me to Experience God and I am now able to sense what he wants to do in my life. I hear his calling loud and clear. God told me many things through prayer and thoughts that I had throughout the book and helped me realize some things. That's why I got this book and it did exactly that. I also liked the many questions and activities that it gave me. So I think it would be better called a workbook or a learning tool. I am telling everyone about this book.
5,Great for my teen son,My teen son wants his daily time with the Lord. He just needed help focusing on topics and passages with a common theme. Blackaby's book provides this.
1,A great resource,"This is a great resource for personal growth in your Christian life. Not just as information, but as experience. A great workbook."
4,"Good introduction, but not enough on the trekking peaks","I found this book a good introduction to anyone expecting to go trekking in East Africa. It goes over, in substantial detail, all the factors you may face (medicine, visas, hotels, transportation, tours, trails, etc.). However, there is very little on the trekking peaks, which I thought would be the most interesting portion of the book. For example, on Mt Kilimanjaro there are only maybe 5-6 pages, with only an overview description of the routes. If you are looking for overall trekking in East Africa, this is good book, but if you are looking for info on the trekking peaks, there are other, more specific guides, that may be more helpful."
5,not a desk,"I used this and decorated it as a vanity table. It has great storage with for 2 small drawers at top, one in bottom; recessed niche all add up to great storage for make up and girlie things. Husband installed jewelry box with millor over like a vanity."
1,poor assembly,put desk together. the door of the desk appears to be put together incorrect. the handle of the door is on the inside which is bizarre.
3,Cheap.,"It's a cheap wooden desk with a hutch. It looks cheap, and it's assembled cheaply.The wood is full of knots and other flaws. Mine has a good sized crack in the wood on the top of the desk itself.The screw holes for the hutch didn't line up well (I ended up using a Dremel on them). Other than that, the assembly was very easy.It's stable and pretty solid.And yes, it's orange. It's basically the same color as the orange text on this page."
3,great art.. kinda lame writing,if your a simpsons fan this is for you.. but dont be supprised if you find it not that funny.. you can easily tell it wasnt written by groening... but its still an alright time killer.
4,It may not be the show but it is just as good.,"For Simpson Comics Extravangsa(I know its wrong). it gives the first 4 episodes in the Simpson Comics. My favoriate part was the one with Robert Tewliger( Sideshow Bob). It is better to get the single comics, but the book looks nice."
1,"No, No, No. I would give it no stars if I could","This album is pure trash, it isn't even close to the first Carter. Cash Money needs 2 beg Manny Fresh 2 come back because the beats r horrible. As far as Wayne, his skillz is pretty much the same as they have been, maybe a little mature cause he didn't used 2 swear. Then they turned around and made him president of Cash Money cause they know if he leaves, they r s**t out of luck. No artists left, no talent left, just stop puttin' out records, please. Still if this album had Fresh's beats it would have been worth koppin', MAYBE."
1,BEST RAPPER ALIVE? HA! HE'S A JOKE,"BEST RAPPER ALIVE? HA! THA KIDS A JOKE...WAT ABOUT E-40? WAT ABOUT YUKMOUTH? WAT ABOUT THUG LORDZ, REGIME LIFE, STAT QUO, LIL FLIP,...LIL WAYNE AINT NO CLASSIC GUY...HE'S NO SOLDIER..MOST OF YALL PROLLY AINT HEARD ""TRIGGAMAN"" BY B.G...""IM THA TRIGGAMAN THA TRIGGA TR TRIGGAMAN..I'LL DO IT MYSELF I DONT GOTTA SEND A MAN""..MOST OF YALL NEVA HEARD ""HE AINT A THUG"" BY YUKMOUTH....LIL WAYNE IS SOFT HE AINT NO N.O. SOLJA! HE'S A LIL SOFT PUNK AND IF HE EVER TRYDA BE IN THA MOBB LIKE HIS SONG HE'D GET WACKED SO FAST LIKE PAUL CASTELLANO HE AINT EVEN RESPECTED IN THA N.O. LIKE B.G. SO HE NEED TA SHUT UP FOR HE GET DROPPED BY BGEEEZY! HE AINT NO STREET N*GGA! HES A WEAK N*GGA..TELL HIM TO GO OVER THERE IN IRAQ AND PUT A GUN ON HIS BACK N BE A REAL SOLJA...HA! THAT BOY WOULD START CRAPPIN HIS PANTS...HE'S A LIL SKINNY PUNK..HE AINT NO BEST RAPPER ALIVE LIKE TUPAC OR FAT TONE OR BIG.."
4,Good album.,"This is a nice album, which is much more lyrically indepth than any other Cash Money release. I became a fan of Wayne after hearing him last year on Tha Carter, and his interesting flow and nice punchlines become quite addicting. Is this better than Tha Carter? Lyrically, yes. Production wise, it's good, but I prefer Mannie Fresh's beats. If Mannie could've been on board for this album, instead of falling out with Cash Money, this may've been a classic. As it stands, though, this is an above average release from Weezy. Best rapper in the game since the best rapper retired? No, he's not, and I hate to tell Wayne, but Jay-Z was definitely not the best in the game before hand. Is this a very good albums though, with little to no filler? Yes, and for that, I commend Lil' Wayne. I look forward to future releases from him, as he is still very young, and his growth as an artist can expand greatly."
4,"finally, southern rap is showing some skillz!","me being a indie artist and all in the south, its hard because folks want the flashy talk about money, cars, and crunkness. I lost hope on the south ever being a standout for lyrical showcases. Lil Wayne, the cash money boy that I thought was going to fade out, changed the game up. The cd is every bit as good as good as the carter 1. His lyrics is up there with the NY rappers. But as with most of the southern pop. they like crunk music. U won't find too much crunk here, just straight lyric torching and ripping through it. For the folks to listen to real music, you gotta pick this up. 4 out of 5"
5,Tha Block is Still Hot,"How can anyone say this isn't a good album? To the people who think he needs Mannie to have a good album he just proves that he doesn't with every track. He's really starting to prove that he's got some real flow and proving that the south does have real lyricists. There's not one bad track on here in my opinion. I think it's a definite candidate for album of the year, along with Sound of Revenge. Wayne is straight fire on this album and you can't deny it. The best rapper alive? From what i've been hearing from the rap industry recently, he may be right."
5,Killah Of All Players,"Lil Way delivers on this albus lyrically. First off, If you Liked The Carter good for you but this is a whole new diffrent kind of sound. If you still didn't Like The Carter...Good for you too coz this is a diffrent kinda sound. This stuff should be flyin of shelves. If only lil wayne had featured more people There would have been a need to extend the rating here to six stars."
2,"How can he talk so much, yet say so little ?","Wayne carries himself like a rap giant. Rarely rapping anymore, just .... speaking. But he never actually shows any rap skillz 2 back it. This kid rarely spits a whole verse without aruptly cuttin it short with ""OH !"", "" fasho"" or my favorate ""the,the,the Carter yep"" Not that it matters cause Wayne doesn't talk about ANYTHING in particular. I guess he's free-stylin mosta the time. {He betta be, can't imagine he wrote this stuff} Freestylin's only so tight. It should only be done on a couple tarcks {or better yet, just don't do it} This album as well as the first Carter is just BORING. Not like his old albums. Where he talked about his ice all the time{that sucked, but ice is a subject to rap about at least}. Wayne ain't sayin ANYTHING {of any signifigance}this time around and most will tire of hearing his voice."
5,Awsome toy!,"This is the most coolest toy ever!I been waiting for days,months,and even years to buy it!I recommend this to any age!I putted 5 star for educational because kids can know what the army use in the battlefield.So,who ever made this toy is cool and rich later on!Thank you!"
3,Baby wasn't too thrilled...,"I bought these for my 5 month old baby thinking she'd love the soft books and the music. I think however, the music was too loud and scared her. She doesn't like them at all. Maybe in a few months! The recomended age is 9 months. I didn't pay attention when I bought them."
4,"Bom, mas sem ter ""o ouvido"" bem treinado pode ser estranho","Comprei esse livro a um tempo. Cheguei a escrever um review, mas sumiu. O livro é legal, as ""estruturas"" so arpejos dos acordes com suas devidas inverses. a maneira de usar essas estruturas que é o diferencial. Como usar o arpejo do menor com 7a em um 2-5-1? So essas coisas que o livro ensina. Bem legais as frases.O interessante é que perdi o cd que vem com ele num avio e pedi ao autor para me mandar outro (estava disposto a pagar por isso). No obtive resposta... Nada que no pude encontrar pela web, no entanto!"
5,War Baby Review,"As I have come to expect from Collector Series publications, this one is amazing in it's detail and thoroughness. There is virtually no area of the development of the M1 Carbine that is not covered, from the engineering to the manufacture to the actual use of the weapon. The book is full of rarely seen photos, letters, and drawings, and each manufacturer is FULLY covered along with all known vendors of parts. If you collect or just enjoy these weapons, this book is a Must-Have!!"
3,goals from 80's and 90's,"With that title, I was hoping to see the best goals of the whole world cup. No - this video only shows the 80's and 90's. Still, some nice goals, but no Pele, Pushka, Osebio, Romario, or Ronaldo. A British production, there are plenty of English goals (not all of them ""classic""). Still fun to watch and well-produced."
2,Wrong date on this volume,The cover shown (and the copy I mistakenly received) was the 2009 edition of The Aims of Education. This covers essays lectures from 2002-2007. I wanted the 1997 edition. Caveat emptor!
5,"PROPELLER- ""Oro""","Of all of Mark Spybey's projects, Propeller is probably my favorite, and this CD is a big reason why. This is the first CD I suggest to someone just starting to get into Spybey. The music is a bit more developed in an ALMOST conventional, new-agey manner. There is still the use of open space and crowded noise, but with this, the second Propeller CD, there is a less intrusive force at work. Whereas the first Propeller album, ""Rame,"" was akin to something one might find cast amongst the works of Hafler Trio, ""Oro"" seems more appropriately compared to something like Robin Storey's Rapoon. I know general comparisons like this drive artists crazy, but I'm just trying to help you all make an informed choice!"
2,Teen movie,Ordered for my teen son. It's all right if you are into that type of thing. Just not my genre of music. No judgement.
1,I wish this feeder would work for me,I have one of these feeders but no matter where I hang it for the birds the squirrels come along and jump on it and dumps out all of the seeds.
3,Metal Legs,"I bought this to use as a ground feeder. The legs are supposed to be made of cedar and they are not. I would not have purchased this had I seen in the photos or read in the description that this was anything other than wood. It rains a lot here and these metal legs will rust. When that happens I will remove the legs and hang it, I guess."
2,Didn't look like the picture,This feeder was supposed to have wooden legs. I should have read the reviews before buying. If I had known it had cheap metal legs I would not have paid that kind of price for it.
3,not a best option for people with big hands,watch s good. finishing is ok. but its width is very less. smaller than ur small finger.
2,"The title is correct, it's mostly a sketchbook.","I should give this a 4 star for sketches, but I'm hard on Architects, they had it easy in school. Anyway the drawings are nice however the designs are mostly dated and some include aspects of passive solar design. The narrative is humorous but sounds like a long ""poor me"" story, but you can just skip that and browse the pictures. I understand Mac Wells is usually referred to as a leader, or as his narrative suggests a martyr, the design of earth sheltered homes has moved on and there is alot more info in books by Rob Roy.Earth-Sheltered Houses: How to Build an Affordable...Not to mention a great deal more discussion of materials, environment, etc.In summary this is a pretty book, but probably boring for engineers or builders."
1,Design Failures,"This book should be called ""Mostly useless sketches of houses that were never built"". As far as I can tell there is only one sketch of a house that was even attempted. While full of architectual ""ideas"" there is almost nothing of value for someone who wants to build their own earth sheltered home. You get the feeling he wrote this book because so many of his designs were not accepted that he just needed the money. Very disappointing."
2,Cinderella in Pompeii,"Let's see. Where have I heard this story before? Oh yes:Live in a far-away kingdom. Be a drudge, cleaning the house for an evil woman. Meet a handsome rich man. Handsome man realizes you are wonderful and you belong together. Become lost - and he searches the kingdom to find you and marries you!I would have accepted this story-line but the characters were quite unbelievable, two-dimensional, and undeveloped. I just couldn't care for them.The depiction of life at that time was just OK. Some interesting details, but not enough. If you want really great descriptions of the daily life of common people during that era, I recommendHousehold Gods, another time-travel book."
1,Awful,I read this while on vacation. Repeative concepts throughout without any drama. Truthfully it was just plain awful. Was hoping for so much more.
4,"Great historical fiction, some writing problems.","I agree with other reviewers that there were some annoyances in the writing of this book. Repetition and foreshadowing that was more like being hit over the head with a club. But the story and the historical detail, evidencing a great deal of research, made it well worth while. I felt transported back to ancient times and enjoyed experiencing it all through the eyes of a time traveler so that I could relate as she did. In spite of my minor criticisms, I would love to read more by this author."
4,HIstorical Magic,She had me when she mentioned going back in time to Pompeii. I was able to relate to this character in a big way. I see myself the same way as this character does as an independent modern educated woman. It's interesting and frustrating to see this all taken away when she goes back in time. You won't be able to put it down.
5,Awesome. I hope to see more of the same from this author,"This was a great read. Although there is a plot to follow, which is engaging and plausable, the descriptions of roman life for both the haves and have nots is accurately depicted. I loved the descriptive immagery. The plot line has a romantic theme to it, but it is not mushy and cliche like a corny romance novel. I am a guy and even I found the romantic theme entertaining. There's more to the plot than romance, the main character is also trying to figure out where she belongs in an era which is not her own. (She travels back through time and space to the city of Pompeii in the year A.D. 62) She finds that a lot of her preconceived notions are false and that human beings are the same regardless of time period. It is a great yarn and a fun read. I hope Rebecca East writes more books along this same line."
2,Was assemble incorrectly!,"Worked fine for composite video, but had lots of diagonal lines and graininess with s-video. I opened up the plug, and the pin for s-video was in the wrong slot! I moved the pin to the correct slot, but it was a pain in the neck! Works great now. Can't recommend this cord, though. Shipping was quick."
1,Crappy S-Video Cables,"Don't buy these. They won't even work on a radial tube TV. Reds become pinks and black spots appear on text. I bought these so that my SNES and N64 could be more up to-date with my HD TV, Wii and PS3. But they refunded me at that's nice."
5,Great bike for the price!,This bike shipped rather quickly. Came in great condition unlike other reviewers. Assembly took about 45 minutes. Installing the front disc brake took me 3 tries before getting it right. Make sure you put the spacer first and then the disc. Overall the bike is great and looks really nice. I changed the tires to some 1.5 city slicks to use with my bell mag trainer. Only adjustment I made was for the deraillure. It was a little off but after adjusting it everything is perfect. You will not go wrong with this purchase. Just read the other reviews for tips on how to put it together since there is no instructions.
5,My absolute favorite,"This is a beautiful, beautiful book about the deep bond that develops between a child and her toy. I have been reading books illustrated by Akiko Hayashi ever since I can remember (I'm 20 now), and I think this is the best book she's ever done. She is extremely observant, and it shows in her illustrations. Just look at the expressions on Aki's face, and you will know what I mean. She also includes some ""treats"" for her observant readers. For example, you will find that Mr. McGregor from ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit"" is riding the same train as Aki! Looking for these ""treats"" can be highly entertaining for both kids and adults. It really is a shame that this book is out of print!"
1,This is crazy.,"This book purports to show that designers and nature often have dimensions in about the 1:4 to 1:6 ratio. Well, big deal. That does not show what golden (etc) ratios are used. The examples that are used to support the hypothesis are APPROXIMATE, and the dimensions chosed for comparison are chosen by people who ALREADY think that things are made with golden ratios. That is just dumb and about as far from scientific as you can get. Furthermore, the maths was not very understandable. Ok, so I just did a LITTLE bit of undergraduate physics and postgraduate statistics and was in the BOTTOM of the top 1% of high schoolers doing maths, so I guess not understanding it is my fault. (I'm not showing off, 'cause none of you know me)."
1,Should have been called a Waste of Time and Money,"I never liked Styles P or anybody in the D-Block crowd(Well Jada is ok sometimes). This took what? 3 years to come out! Ha ha, 50 really did kill their careers. D-Block made a huge mistake by messing with the Unit. Sheek Louch flopped, this flopped, and J-Hood's album will never see the light of day. Oh yeah and this album sucks too, the only song I liked was the one with Akon. If you want some real east coast rap go get the new albums by Nas, Lloyd Banks, and DMX. This is one of the worst albums of the year.Thumbs down."
4,Good guide,"This one may not get you 40% but it does tell you a unique trick with the IRAs. you can flip real estate over and over again without paying immediate taxes. the downside? you can't withdraw your earnings but for long term, it is awesome. the book talks about tax liens being used for IRAs, though I agree with that, do not use this book to learn about tax liens or tax sales, or you're gonna get burned. read up on Investing Without Losing (ISBN 0978834607 NOT on amazn, other stores) or something similar."
4,A well-balanced portrait of compassion and forgiveness,"In 'Dr. Wortle's School' Anthony Trollope takes on a very controversial and scandalous subject, that of a bigamous marriage. With a very even hand Trollope allows us to see into the motivations of his characters and truly come to understand why they've done the things they've done, and how they justify their actions. Instead of preaching religion, which clearly isn't Trollope's style, he chooses to take a more liberal look at the underlying morality of the actions of his characters. 'Dr. Wortle's School' has a very modern ring for a Victorian novel, and the themes and characters could easily have been depicted by Joanna rather than Anthony Trollope. Add to that the mysterious tone of Wilkie Collins and you have a very satisfying Victorian novel."
1,Spend the money for the Tahiti,"As the other reviewer mentioned, this boat has no Boston valves--it has the same plug-type air valves that a kid's raft has, as if you're going to fill it by mouth (the side tubes are inflated to 1psi and took 15 minutes each with a fast pump; I can't imagine inflating them by mouth).The floor has its own valve, and on the one I got, that one has no one-way flap in it. In order to inflate the floor, you have to pump faster than it deflates and then plug it quickly. The one-way valves on the side tubes make the boat nearly impossible to deflate (I put a chopstick in it to hold it open).The included paddle bites, so the thirty bucks you save over the Tahiti is totally NOT worth it. The boat may be based on the same design, but it's far from the same boat. Mine's going back before it ever sees water."
4,New Method(s) for Reading & Interpreting the I Ching,"I recently purchased this version of the I Ching and am intrigued by the ability to do readings based upon the date & time of an event or meeting. I've applied it to two recent concerns and received interesting, thought-provoking answers which were in accordance with my intuition.The main problem I have with the methods described in this book is that they are quite time-consuming and tedious for a person who is not mathematically oriented or skilled. I hope to improve my understanding of the methodology by practice so that I can make more use of this version in the future.Also, the presentation of the 64 hexagrams at the end of the book is quite simplified. I would advise anyone using this book to consult other, more detailed versions of the I Ching for further interpretation after obtaining the primary hexagram, changing line, and secondary hexagram with this book."
1,Not recommended,"I bought this card recently but is not working properly with following Access Point.- DLINK DI-624+ (Can detect, can connect but keep disconnect)- NETGEAR (Cannot detect)- Linksys Wireless-G Router (Cannot detect signal)- 3COM (Can detect, sometimes connect, always disconnect)I already try the latest driver.I also email to tech support but never replied.Belkin should improve the customer support."
4,My first western.,"I read this for a lark; I usually read mysteries or romance books. I was surprised how readable it was and not overly violent, which I feared. I learned a lot about the everyday west and appreciated the historical facts he threw in. Very good."
4,heart rate monitor,The monitor works great and reliably. I feel confident in trusting the readings. Great value for the money.
2,"A little here, a few there.","Well, it's not good for video, it's slower than sd cards, harder to use with computer. It's too bad that the Olympus SW series only uses this. It works fine for a while, but it will have card errors. I was really upset when it forced me to format it and have all the pictures I wanted to be erased... It's good for Olympus because it's the only one there. But, the solution is to format it regularly, which I don't like to do."
5,Valuable reference for campers!,"This book is a must-have if you plan on camping in any of the Wisconsin State Parks.Not only does it contain the usual maps and information for each park, but it also has descriptions of the campsites by campsite number! In my opinion, the campsite descriptions alone make the book worth buying.I frequently make reservations at a campground before I visit a particular park for the first time. In the past I was assigned the next available campsite number and I had no idea what it is like until I arrived at the park. Several times I arrived at the park only to find that my site was quite sloped or too small to put my tent on!Now, before calling in the reservations I read the book and pick out a few campsites that are level, grassy, and partly shaded (my preference!) and ask for them by number. It makes the entire camping trip so much more enjoyable."
3,"Great Item, weak motor","I have five carousels and like this item. But, the drive motor is very weak and the carousle gear gets mis-aligned. Re-aligning the gear is not difficult, just inconvient. The seller is very helpful and was very quick to replace faulty items.I would recommend this item, as one of the reveiwer wrote, ""it is better than a shoebox."""
4,Works well!,I compared this with the Imation version. Pretty sure this is the better disc sorter. I needed the Mac filing software which is the biggest reason I went with this carousel.It has worked well for 5 months although a little noisey...but bearable.The biggest downside on this item is the price. $85 would have been about right.
5,Love it Even Without MAC Drivers,"The reviews below show this item comes with MAC drivers or that you can get them, but this is no longer true as of 3 months ago. This is still ok with me because Im both MAC and PC ready. It is a great system. I have 3 and daisy chain them to store all my CDs and DVDs. The cataloging at first can take awhile to set it up but its worth the time spent. Works very well with the Collectorz software, and is also available at the same merchant X-treme Geek on Amazon.I would recommend this product to anyone who has CDs and DVDs."
3,"Good hardware, lousy software","The hardware seems nice and was easy to setup; the software has limited function and appears to have been written by a high school computer project, maybe even a junior high!"
2,An interesting but rambling tale,"Ms. Bird provides an interesting and, at times, exciting account of her sea adventures. The unexplained nautical terms and somewhat convoluted story structure made this reader rush forward to finish the book and hopefully find the ""punch-line."" I was disappointed."
1,Awful!,"An anorexic woman whines her way across the Atlantic and Med. No sense of adventure or accomplishment to the feat - just an endless litany of angst and self-doubt laced with an empty, transparent pseudofeminism. Not really a book about a sailing adventure at all. In fact, if someone in your life is interested in sailing and you would like to discourage them - give them this book!"
3,This Game is an OK game,I read the reviews and someone said that it takes 2 seconds instead of 8. You need a faster computer for this game to work right. I think this game is fun but it does get kind of boring once you play it all day for a whole week. I think playing the cowboy is the hardest. Playing the bull is easy and fun.
5,Bravo,"Si a Monterroso no le dan el nobel por lo menos publiquenle su trabajo en un libro de primaria de su pais.Monterroso es un mago de la satira. Sus cuentos tienen veneno y de pronto hasta alguna que otra moraleja. La Oveja Negra es una de las historias mas repetidas en la historia Latinoamericana y Monterroso la redacta con un cuento ""inofensivo""Es tan dificil describir este monstruo de la literatura que solo recomendare comprar el libro..."
1,"Do your research, please.","My Chemical Romance is not a British band. They're all from New Jersey, except for Bob, who is from Chicago."
1,???,"Well for one thing, the cover of the book states that this is the biography of My Chemial Ro*ijdhky*ce, so obviously THAT band is from Bellville, Great Britain and has a singer who precociously went to art school in 1966 before he was even conceived. What kind of book cover has the title smeared until it's illegible.And another thing, I tried searching for Seamus Craic on google and I didn't return any viable results.And thank goodness I came on to Amazon to see all these reviews, because now I'm definitely convinced that this book is not worth a single penny."
1,Masters of Disaster,"Fine --- the writers are ""experts"" of Character Animation, but before you release a book, I think that you should have placed a little more emphasis on the make up of the book and the quality of the information provided. After spending hours upon hours going through some of the exercises, it dawned on me that their procedures were way undereffective (is this even a word!) and outdated. Be warned -- this is a complete waste of valuable money. There are many other resources for building realistic characters out there.I do however praise the authors for coming out with a book dedicated to modeling characters. A great step forward, but with careless steps."
3,Great find!!,"I recently bought the Hyperscan game console at a local Tuesday Morning for [...] I've never seen or heard of it before that. At the store they didn't have any of the booster cards so thats why I came to Amazon. My son LOVES X-Men and I knew I had found something just right for him, and the price was right for me!! The cards are thick so they dont bend, unless you have destructive children haha. The seller was very prompt with the shipping too! Great find!!"
2,14.95 for 54 minutes ?,are u serious ? Not a good value in my mind at all. The other personal defense videos were 280 plus minutes and were less than 20 bucks.
4,good product,"That was I expected to buy to my son.good product, good price, I recommended it, so if you wantquality and brand, so buy it."
4,top super,lo recomiendo FUE lo esperado El Producto cumplió Con mis Expectativas ya cumple Que Con Lo Publicado 100% Recomendado uno de La Comunidad del Amazonas
4,great glove for the money,I paid about $22 for this glove to use for my company softball team and am not disappointed. I have no idea how long this thing will last but its a cheap solution for anyone who needs a working glove to play catch or softball with. It arrives fairly soft already so it doesn't need to be worked in and it appears to be made from real leather. It also fits my hand just fine (I am a 6' tall guy).Pretty happy with a $22 glove to play non-competitive softball and catch with.
5,Oldie But Goodie Christmas Album,"Good recorded music is where you find it. (One of my very favorite Christmas CDs was a freebie from a box of Chex cereal.) I purchased this CD in the early years of CDs, the mid-1980s. (The copyright for the compilation is 1985.) The songs were taken from Columbia Masterworks albums released during the period 1963-1983. The sound quality (analog sources!) is very good even by current standards. Equally important, the music is beautiful, well-chosen, and well-sequenced. The selections strike me as being among the cream of the Columbia Records classical catalog. As you can see, these CDs are now available very inexpensively on Amazon.com. Don't be fooled by the low price! This will be a worthy addition to your Christmas Music Collection."
1,Lots of promise-no volume,I hoped this would replace my prior wired car kits. The speaker is inadequate. You have to be parked in a quiet area with the engine off to hear this unit and understand or be understood. You may as well park and use your handset. Don't waste your money!
1,I hate it and so do the cats.,Doesn't work worth a whit. All four cats refuse to use the litter box with this product present. Absolute Junk.
1,No Thankyou,This product is god awful! My cats stopped using their litter boxes immediately! I had a bigger mess to clean up than before.
2,Pretty pointless,"Romantic comedies aren't the greatest of movies to start off with, but this one is even worse than most. It's not clear why anybody ever produced it. It seems really sloppily done. The acting is horrible - even Jennifer Love Hewitt, who's not half bad. The filming screams ""made-for-TV"". The script and plot seem like they were phoned in by a teenage writer. There's no character or humor. The only part that made me laughed was the postcard from the African orphan. Still, I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 stars because we get to see Jennifer Love Hewitt in bikinis and she still looks good."
3,Just mediocre,"If you like Jennifer Love Hewitt, this movie is just ok. The best thing about it is her clothing/fashion and hair/makeup...but the movie in and of itself was not that great. If you are a fan you will enjoy her many different looks in the film but there's not much else to it than that."
3,"Cute and funny, but no substance.","I enjoyed the film, laughed a bit, and rooted for the love story, even if I could not relate to the excessive materialism of the main character. If you prefer flair and wit to substance, you might enjoy this film. But I would advise most to watch it on TV. It isn't quite worth the purchase price, and is best suited as a late night distraction."
1,IS THERE A PLACE FOR MINUS STARS?,"If ""Love"" continues to do movies like this, and even have the gall to help produce them, she'll forever remain irrelevant and trite as a movie star. She's got talent potential. What she does NOT have is any sense. As far as this movie is concerned, don't bother to go there. I wish I hadn't. Poor writing. Poor plot. Poor you, if you watch it. You've been warned."
4,If you need them you need them.,"I bought the 10lb plates for deadlifts. These plates are for an olympic bar but I was able to make them work on a standard bar with screw on collard without any problem. This dropped the weight down to just 40lbs which was just right for my daughter.These plates work great for what they are. My son's deadlifts look A LOT better with these plates instead of the smaller plated he was using. I am not sure how much banging around they could take but if you are using these plates you should not be hitting the floor very hard anyway but be concentrating on technique.Bottom line if you are going to do deadlifts, and I think everyone should, and you can not do 135lbs (olympic bar) or 120lbs (standard bar) you need these plates. I am glad I spent the money on them after seeing the difference with my sons deadlifts.The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because I can't help but to think that for a rubber plate they should cost a little less."
5,all time favorite,"This has been one of my favorite CD's for nearly a decade now! It is great. I had the first DSC CD and had listened to it over and over and over (LOVE IT) and bought this one as soon as it came out. I have given both DSC CD's as gifts to many people over the years and everyone loves them. Why, oh why, don't they make another CD or two or three or .....A fantastic group!"
4,Don't expect a textbook,"Design and Form is a solid text, with many examples of the type of work that Itten tasked his students with. Itten does not, however, lay out a series of lectures for the student. Rather, Itten lays out a path of experimentation and self-discovery for the student to follow. Much of the content will be familiar to anyone who has read The Art of Color, and for those people, I could not recommend buying (nor could I recommend avoiding) this book. If the reader needs clarity on a subject, many examples prod the reader into finding a solution.In sum: A good (but not great) text when considered on its own merits, and an average text when considered in conjunction with Itten's other works."
5,It Is Great,I would have to say this is really a great book.Its not true that its the same as her other books.I recomend buying it if you love adventure and mystery.I loved it.
4,A Very Outstanding Story,"Marti sets out to find the murderer of her dear friend. While everyone was led to believe that he committed suicide, Marti knows this is not true. With only the support of an officer, Marti is desperate to find the killer before he strikes again. An outstanding, bone-chilling suspense. Joan Lowery Nixon has done it again."
4,Brandon ...,"What happens when your friend you've known your whole life turns up dead? The police say it was suicide but you know he was murdered. In a small town called Farrington Park, Marti Lewis has that same problem. After one of her best friends is murdered, she must prove to everyone. Everyone says she's wrong and that she's going through the denial phase of death. She goes to the police station and talks to them. Karen Prescott, a police officer, is the only one who will listen to her. Later, Marti soon finds out that instead of just investigating she will be fighting for her life."
5,What a great book!!!,I lisented to this book on cd and I used every spare mintue I had to listen to it. I belived Marti every step of the way and it made me mad that no one else would listen to her. I loved the suspense and I recomend this book to anyone!
5,Good clean fun!,"All the fun you'd expect if a whole town decided to go Cold Turkey and give up smoking together. This was back when everybody smoked, from the local doctor to the preacher and his closet-smoking wife. We enjoyed this movie back when it came out and it was still funny seeing it again recently. Some humor doesn't hold up that long, but this movie won't disappoint."
2,"Critics Rave, Viewers Sit in Confusioin","As the movie ended and the credits were rolling up the screen I sat there and wondered what any of it meant and could only think of the money I had just wasted by purchseing it. This is another example of critics raving about a movie only to find that most people didn't like it, or didn't understand it. Of course one doesn't want to say one didn't understand it as that makes one ""culturally inferior"". So be it. It was a terrible movie, other than the beautiful photography and colors, the plot made no sense, the actors actions were not understandable and one constantly wondered what one had missed along the way that would lead to such confusion. You should not have to read a review to understand a movie, but I did keep returning to the DVD case to reread what it said about it. Unfortunately, the liner notes were of no use in unravelling the pointless plot. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,First Lady,"Another one of the same. Except for ""Honey Moon"" and ""Hot Shot"" if you've read one Susan Elizabeth Phillips novel you've read them all. ""First Lady"" is no different. Sexually repressed woman meets macho man, and macho man liberates repressed woman fulfilling all her sexual fantasies. Please! I will say that Ms Phillips is a very polished writer, but like the man says ""she's got her story and she's sticking to it"". And we're informed on the inside cover that she's writing another macho football player versus repressed young woman in her next novel. This will be the fourth time she's told this story. Give us a break Ms. Phillips. You're fans deserve more than the same trite story over and over."
2,First Lady,"I have loved SEP forever and couldn't wait for this book to come out. I will admit that I was greatly disappointed.This hero will never leave your heart fluttering. The story was long with little interest and unbelievable and boring scenes. I couln't believe that this was a SEP book. Even Copeland Bride was better than this book and it was one of her earlier titles.Our great first lady wants to be just normal like the rest of us... She dresses like an old woman to escape and then like a pregant lady traveling in a camper trailer. Sure, we all live like this... The hero cant stand being around girls as he raised all of his sisters and is cruel and rude to the children and often disrespectful. I do not find this funny at all.I read page by page as a troubled teen took the show. This book should have been titled ""Lucy, the girl who met the First Lady"".Sorry to all SEP lovers around. If you are looking for a good and fun read - this is not it."
2,The Last Lady,"This was my third SEP's novel I have read and I considered it a great disappointment. The heroine is very unbelieveable and dumb, while the ending completely lacks quality. If one is considering reading this book, one should start out with It Had to be You or one of SEP's earlier works."
3,"Not revolting, not a keeper, just more of the same","My first impression of First Lady was a sense of deja vu--hmm, a woman quashed by the political demands of an overbearing father and a husband who is a closet homosexual, where had I heard that before? Barbara Delinsky's Within Reach, of course. Just like Within Reach, our intrepid heroine escapes the confines of her restricted political life, all without revealing any messy details about her husband's private life. But, since this is the 00's, not the 80's, our heroine ends up in office, not a happy housewife, and there are problem children to take care of instead of indictments. Granted, the problem children are realistically cute and annoying, but the ending is over-the-top and cloying (would Andre really do a black power salute? Would our hero really become Our Correspondent In The White House? Not!)."
4,A Delightful Read,"For anyone who is a real fan of the romance genre, this book is a delightful romp. Susan Phillips has a way with words that is witty, humorous and thoroughly entertaining. I had great difficulty putting it down, and was so disapponted when I finished--so much so that I immediately ordered six more of her books. It's a book that makes you laugh and leaves you smiling."
1,"Boring, Unrealistic","I rushed out the day this book was released to purchase and read. Don't bother rushing. The story is lacking from the first few pages.Ms. Phillips had a great story line, but did not use it wisely. The hero and heroine, for both being supposedly smart do all things stupid. The only interesting character is the teenager."
4,Very satisfying,"The book was very good. It was just the right length and kept moving along. My only question was ""how old was the First Lady?"" It must have mentioned it somewhere, but I don't remember seeing it."
3,"Good Idea, Not So Good Story","I've always been able to rely on SEP's novels to keep me up late turning the pages. Usually her characters and dialog shine. However, I found myself really having to plod through this book, out of a sense of obligation to read it after I'd spent the money. I found the hero and heroine dull and unlikable, and I felt like I was suffering through endless pages of arguments between the two, punctuated by the tantrums of an un-endearing teenaged girl and a too-graphic description of the bodily functions of a baby with chronic carsickness. Not charming. Too much time on the road, too little plot development. The idea was a good one, but it was lost in the telling of the story, which - unlike her others - has a dark and disturbing undertone throughout. If you are a fan of SEP, you may want to check this one out of the library or borrow it, because I don't think you'll find it similar to her other works, and you may not want to keep it around afterwards."
2,not one of her best,"Having enjoyed most of SEP's book, I was disapointed in this latest book. While the plot was original, the book failed to interest me on the whole..."
2,Not Beliveable,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Phillips, and looked forward to this book, only to be greatly disappointed.I thought the premise was great, but you can't take a smart savy lady, make her dumb and then smart and savy agian, all within a 2 week period.The other problem with believability was the heroine kept talking about how she hated politics and wanted away from it, and then turns around and goes right back into it."
4,"Not her ""Heaven, Texas"" but still ahead of the pack!","This isn't one of SEP's very best books but we already have many perfect 5s from this writer. Nevertheless, it's awfully entertaining and a good, entertaining read that one can snarf down in a single evening. But if you don't have this writer's backlist, you are truly missing something extraordinary."
3,not an exact fit for Buon Caffe 330,"Purchased this as a replacement gasket for the Buon Caffe 330 but it's so very slightly thinner than the original and leaks under pressure. May have to try applying a bit of oil to see if I can get the gasket to swell slightly and form an adequate seal. Otherwise, I suppose I'll be looking for a new espresso machine.No complaint about the supplier - Gasket was delivered in a very timely manner. It's not their fault that this Krupps gasket doesn't exactly fit my obsolete Buon Caffe machine."
1,Wasted Opportunity,"What could have been an excellent dip into British Noir turns into a predictable hotch-potch of ITV-style crime drama. What sets the book apart from the rest of British crime is the fact that it has no real idea about Britain. There aren't any ""elevators"" for instance, nor do job centres have spikes to put notes on. And not everyone who's unemployed is an inveterate gambler.Smalltime falls into too many deeply dubious stereotypes to be of any worth. That's not to say it's not well-written, because it is. Unfortunately, the plot is wafer-thin and the characters sketchy at best. Our main protagonist, Chris, is supposedly some sort of chick-magnet, three girls on the go at the same time, but his appeal is never explained. Dashy's bad homelife is straight out of a bad Ken Loach film. As for Kevin... Well, he's really nothing more than a bad guy.All in all, it sounds like an American trying to write for a British audience. And it falls flat...Bloodlines should know better."
2,Big Waste of My Money,"I thought this release of Hit 'N' Run Lover 2006 was going to be great. I don't like any of the versions in this new CD. If available in the future,I'd love to purchase a CD with the original 1981 Hit 'N' Run Lover with both the short radio version and the longer 12"" version dance clubs used to play. The horns and strings were awesome in the original."
2,Some strange tailoring flaws,"The material is nice and soft, and jeans looked well finished.However, for some reason the left side pocket is cut very small, much smaller that the right pocket.It is so small that I can hardly get my hand inside, which makes it useless.Also, the back hip pockets are stitched in a strange location, very close to the side seam. Although this does seem odd when reaching for ones wallet, it is very noticeable when sitting in a car seat and your wallet protrudes from the side. Besides, my wife thinks they look strange when viewed from behind, which seems to bother her more than I.Bottom line... 2 Stars at best."
5,It's Not About Men,"What a great book! I found it to be a very straightforward and enjoyable to read guide for how to live a more full and happy life in general, not just for single women. Many of the practical and creative suggestions within could be useful for all women. After reading this book, I felt like I had a new understanding about my role in creating the kind of life that I want for myself, simply by making conscious choices and prioritizing how I direct my time and energy. This book addresses many of the critical challenges facing women in these times, and offers positive and sound solutions and options. Highly recommended."
3,Did He?,"The somewhat sensational title obscures the fact that this is meant to be a scholarly work, though presented for the general public. But while Dever is a well-known anthropologist and scholar, there are too many mistakes, misquotations and the like for the work to be taken too seriously. It is interesting, though."
3,Did God have a Wife,Excellent content but somewhat boring style. Maps inadequate: author should have had clear maps drawn specific to this book. Diagrams not always clear to a lay reader
4,good music from a great singer!,"I enjoy carrie underwoods c.d a lot! in fact her song ""inside your heaven"" was my boyfriends dedicated song at a school dance! I just feel that i can relate to her and her music! so it's a great c.d! Buy it!"
2,Carrie Underwood / Inside Your Heaven,"With her powerful but unskillful voice and pretty face, it's no question she got votes to become an American Idol, ""country versoin"". However, her talent is very limited in just one field. (Check AI's stage performance) ""Inside Your Heaven"" might please some people who really fond of country music. I bebelive she can do just fine in country music. It's nice to be a American Country Idol anyway. Get some vocal lessons, listen more kinds of mucsic, try out some different tunes, perhpas she will have staying power in real world someday instead of few months of fame. We would like a new fresh and unique voice, not just sound like Trisha Yearwood or Martina McBride beacuse you can't out sing them. Prove me wrong and try to have your own voice."
5,Carrie Underwood was my choice from her audition,"Not only does Carrie have a BEAUTIFUl flawless singing voice she is also a beautiful young woman... Carrie will be a huge sucess in the Country music business as well as pop... Today i purchased her CD with the songs Inside Your Heaven and Independence Day.... I was in complete AWE with Carrie's singing.... Bravo to you Carrie Underwood, you truly deserved to win the title of AMERICAN IDOL to season #4 and was my choice from the auditions."
1,SLOW,I am trying to be fair but this cd doesn't sound like what one would expect from an american idol.
1,Amateurish,"I don't like her version of Inside your Heaven. She sounded so amateurish and her Independence Day, all I can say is she's no Martina. She didn't do the song justice."
2,Ok But nothing to write home about,Carrie is a sweet girl but her version is nothing special.Bo does it much better!He has so much soul.Carrie will probably only be temporary in the spotlight.
2,Not what I expected from an American Idol,"I really did like Carrie when she was on American Idol, but this is a very mediocre single. Its just nothing special, she is no different than all the other country singers out there. Infact shes nowhere near as good as Martina McBride, Faith Hill, Leann Rimes, Shania Twain, Reba etc. She'll be around for a few years, and that'll be it. I think America got it wrong for the first time in all 4 seasons. The recording is VERY bland and emotionless. I do hope her album is better than this, for her sake!"
1,Not Appealing,Poor intonation and uneven tone from the singer. Very little range of emotion or feeling projected.
3,Good watch but watch band is difficult to close,"The good reviews set high expectations, but no wow factor here. Good watch except the watch band is very difficult close - never seen this type of watch band."
2,Outdates very fast,outdated the day I got it .. did help for a few of the current games I had on the shelf. Worked as advertised.
2,Less than what I had hoped for,"No Survivors Please is an attempt at and intelligent SCI-Fi film from the paranoid 60's that was just too talky for me. It was an interesting attempt, but just didn't have enough ""pop"" for me. Black Cobra is a crime film that seems to meander around too much for my tastes. I may not have been smart enough to appreciate either of these, so keep that in mind."
1,Update to previous review,"Update: I wrote to Mr. Coffe regarding the problem with the leaking coffeemaker. I received a prompt reply indicating that I would be sent a replacement part. I actually just received a whole new unit. I will now give this new replacement unit a try and hope that the design has been modified to elimate the leaking.Previous: After one month of use, this attractive coffee maker begins to leak all over the counter. I make 6 cups of coffee each morning so it should not an issue of overflowing because of too much water in the resevoir. The counter floods with brewed coffee randomly 5 out of 7 times...what a mess. I am hoping to return the unit and get my money back. I would not recommend until this defect is fixed."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"This coffee maker actually made coffee for about 4 months, then it started leaking. Then it became completely clogged and non-functional due to all the ""special"" parts that boiled off the water and condensed minerals inside the tubing. Maybe if you want to purchase distilled water just to make coffee, it would work for you. Otherwise it's a nifty looking peice of junk.0 stars."
2,leaky coffee maker,"I loved our new cofee maker. Has a cool clock,delay brew feature,permanant filter and was very nice looking. It really jazzed up my kitchen. I was utterly in love with it for a about a month. The damn thing leaks. There is basically a puddle of water under it every time I use it. I still do love it (not the leaking) If you prefer to not spend your time mopping up puddles of water, try the new model with the stainless steel carafe."
1,Awful Coffeemaker,"We have this coffee maker since October 2006, it leaks all over the bottom and down the back. It does NOT make the best coffee either, we should have kept our KRUPS coffeemaker and I did email Mr. Coffee to let them know what an awful product this is. We are now going to buy another KRUPS and trash this Mr. Coffe. I really would not even have given it a one star review other than it looks nice on the counter."
1,Appearance isn't everything,"The last Mr. Coffee Coffee Pot I purchased lasted six or seven years. This one was a junker in less than one. Not only has the coating to the burner peeled off, but has it left a permanent stain on my counter top because of the constant leaking. Finally, and above all else, the alarm on the maker is so loud that when the coffee is done it wakes my daughter up on the second floor. I have had to delay making coffee every morning so she will sleep longer."
1,"It leaked, and now it's dead","The only positive aspect of this coffee maker is that you can get a very hot cup of coffee.However, it leaks (as reported by others), and now it is dead 2 months after purchase. It appears to be working, (timer engages, etc.) but nothing happens.I'm going back to Cuisinart or Braun."
1,Must of got a lemon . . .,"How long have we been making drip coffeemakers???? this is not a new engineering feat. Mr. Coffee should be ashamed of this particular model. However, I do think that most drip coffee makers are ""cheap"" plastic. This model so far is the worst. YES THE COFFEE DOES RUN OUT ALL OVER THE COUNTER! Between the tilt of the coffee basket and the low flow stream of coffee runs down the outside of the carafe creating the coffee puddle."
1,Terrible design. It leaks everywhere.,"This coffee pot is the bane of my existence. It worked fine for a month or two, then it would leak coffee all over the counter if I didn't stand there and reseat the filter as it started to brew. So no more using the timer. Very upsetting to find a mess first thing in the morning. Then last week it just started pouring coffee everywhere no matter how carefully you put everything in place. The machine is less than 6 months old.On the upside, it makes a good cup of coffee on the strong brew setting, if you don't mind licking it off the counter!"
3,Mixed Bag,"This coffeemaker is really cool-looking (mine is red) and makes great tasting coffee which it keeps sufficiently warm. It leaks out the bottom of the reservoir, however, despite being only about 5 months old and regularly cleaned. So, really, it's a mixed bag."
2,Design Flaw,"The unit I have has a design flaw. When the coffee is brewing and the basket fills with water, instead of tripping the control to let the coffee flow into the pot, it instead fills to the top of the basket and flows over and then all over the counter. Only half of the coffee gets into the pot. My husband took a plastic spoon and broke it in half and stuck the straight end in the front of the basket which fixed it in some way. Unfortunately, I do not have the receipt so, I am now stuck with this sorry thing that has had to be rigged in order to work correctly. I am very disappointed in this Mr. Coffee product as I have used Mr. Coffee products all of my adult life and I am about to be 55 years old."
1,We had nothing but problems!,"I'm very happy for whoever this coffeemaker actually works for. Unfortunately that wasn't me. The day after I purchased it, the caraffe started leaking uncontrollably when poured, so when we brewed 12 cups of coffee we were lucky to get 10. Also, there is soem sort of ""gasket"" on the back- has anyone seen this thing? Water leaks out of it during the brew cycle and onto the cord, so when your pot of coffee is finally ready you have a puddle all over the counter. Another flaw is the condensation. Yes, I realize that all coffeemakers will have some sort of condensation inside the lid but when we would lift the lid four hours after making the coffee, the condensation would drip down the sides of the machine and (again) all over the counter. I wanted to love this, I really did. But seriously, you're better off with a $20 machine that doesnt give you any headaches."
4,excellent product,We bought this particular coffee maker for two reasons: 1)It was red and we are switching over to all red kitchen stuff 2)after reading the list of features I was intrigued.Things I like:* aesthetically appealing* lets you choose a reg brew or strong brew* Filter* Brew time indicatorDislikes* I prefer a digital clock* having trouble finding a Mr. Coffee brand permanent filterI am very pleased with this machine.
2,Dead on arrival,"This product arrived with three AAA batteries. Two of the batteries were obviously damaged (on the negative end of the battery). The third battery was completely dead. The headlamp works OK (with my own supplied batteries). The feel to the headlamp is ""cheap"". I am not sure how long it will last out in the woods with hard use."
5,Brinkman Headlamp,"This is a great headlamp. I bought this back in high school to take on a week-long camping/canoeing trip (over 5 years ago) and I have not had a single problem with it since. I plan on taking this with me for the next field training exercise I go on. The red lamp feature is great (we get yelled at for using white light at night).I would definitely recommend this. It's inexpensive, lasts for a long time, uses readily available batteries, is bright (in white light), and has a red light."
3,"After so many years, is this the best they can do?","Next to the mind-blowing Ninja Scroll, The Proffesional is my favorite anime. Since I saw it only a week before Queen Bee, I wasn't nearly half as disappointed as the other reviewers who (poor souls) must have waited for the better part of a decade for more stories of the greatest anti-hero in the history of Japanese animation. This ""follow-up"" retains the action, gore, and eroticism of the Proffesional. The tragic theme of a man's ambition bringing the ruin of his family is repeated. I was particularly interested in the conclusion which further explored the depths of Duke's bull-headed obsession with meeting the terms of his contract in the name of some archaic form of honor. Sadly, this is only a watered-down version of it's classic predecessor. What really disturbed me was Duke's new voice actor. A Barry White sound-alike?! What were they smoking?"
1,Just Plain Bad,This had to be one of the worst anime films I have seen. This had a good plot until they brought in all the pointless sex. Then it got just plain bad. I highly recommed you don't buy this.
2,Where did the Duke go?,"This movie was a disaster. I only enjoyed it because I have watched The Professional: Golgo 13 a hundred times, but Queen Bee is a bad movie that does not give Duke the credit he deserves. This movie also has a ridiculous amount of sex and violence in it. The first movie was classy-violence, while Queen Bee is just silliness. If you are a fan of the Duke, then watch this movie. I only bought it because I am a faithful fan of Mr. Toga. If you like James Bond, then you might like this but PLEASE WATCH THE FIRST MOVIE BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT THIS ONE."
5,Awesome!,"This album is my mom's favorite Sedaka. I bought it for her for x-mas she was thrilled. She used to play this album when we were kids. So, she is happy to have it in CD forum. My sister was mad that I didn't get her one. I didn't know she liked Neil that much. lol My mom will burn her a copy off the original CD."
2,70mph Virginia to Rhode Island,"Used this cartop carrier on a long road trip. It was extremely difficult to zip once the items were packed.I did not overfill the bag or try to stuff it shut and it was still hard to zip. I needed to use a pair of pliers. The plastic is brittle even in moderate temperatures (50degrees). The configuration of the strap/net is difficult with only 2 horizontal roof racks (racks running the width of the roof). I had to use extra lashings. It did rain all night on the bag left atop the car in a hotel parking lot. Rained the entire 1/2 trip home from PA to RI. The result was that several items were wet. It works great for extra space for things like kids plastic toys or items that can be bagged inside the carrier. My trip was a great test of the bag...highway speeds with constant rain and lots of wind. Still, it's pretty good for the price besides the brittle zipper."
4,Good product,"My spouse and I drove from North Carolina to California with the Rain-X roof pouch fully loaded and strapped to the top of our Buick SUV. We took a week to make the trip and encountered heavy rain at least twice. Everything was dry and in good condition when we arrived in California. I would definitely recommend this product. The only drawback is that the canvas has a very strong smell (from the waterproofing treatment?) and the clothes we packed in the pouch carried the smell afterward, but it was nothing that a quick run through the laundry couldn't fix."
3,Just Fair,"For the money, I suppose this Roof Topper is OK. All the other reveiws are correct though, because the vinyl is so thick, the zippers are near impossible to get closed with your bare hands. Not a real big deal for me because I just took a pair of lock grip pliers with me and had no issues getting it zipped and unzipped. The good news is that it is definitely water proof. I drove through a torrential down pour, and it kept everything dry. I think my biggest surprise was how small it actually was. I couldn't get nearly as much as I expected packed in the thing. Next time, I'll probably spend the money to get a bigger, better, hard shell one."
2,Received defective,"After extensive research for roof top storage, I selected this one. When I received it, the seam b/t the zipper & the bag itself was defective & already ripping. The zipper was very difficult to use & I think, w/ more than one use, this bag may have ripped w/out the defective zipper. I returned mine immediately. Buy @ your own risk. Thank you Amazon for refunding return shipping!"
4,wonderful for price,"bought this in a pinch, to go on vacation, to save space inside vehicle.we were thinking of a regular rooftop, but decided for the price, it was more effecient and economical to buy/try this first.works wonderful, only rained on us once, so to fully test how weather tight this is, it wasnt a fair test, but, the ease, and price work well. Being prior military, I always double pack my items to begin with, ie in ziplocks, garbage bags, etc......I would highly recomend for anyone, but just to be safe, double bag it !!! (that is if you expect allot of rain,sleet, snow......)buy, try, enjoy...... works well, a little odd if you don't pack it correctly, kinda have to make it square(the fit of the item, for it to look and hold up on rooftop better......."
2,Let the buyer beware.,"The product looked real nice BUT, You do not find out untill you open the box from Amazon that you NEED TO HAVE THE ROOF RACK WITH THE 4 RAILS NOT THE ROOF RACK WITH THE 2 RAILS."
4,good bag,This bag is good. It stores a lot of stuff. We went through a rain storm and everything inside was kept dry. The only issue is that the buckles were too large to fit under the rack on top of the van. We had to take the buckles off and feed through the strap then put the buckle back on.
3,Car carrier,"I purchased this item and for the most part it worked great, all items stayed dry. However, due to the colder temperature outside, the carrier was a bit more difficult to manipulate the luggage into, and the zipper totally sucked! Once I arrived at the warmer destination, it worked great. May need some silicone spray on the zipper. One could load items into the bag in the house, but be need definite help in getting up on top of the vehicle. I guess for the price for me it served the immediate purpose."
4,Good Investment,"I thought this was a cost effective way to get our luggage out of our cabin space. It held 3 large sized suitcases, very tough fit but worth the squeeze. The zipper seemed tough enough to put some pressure on it and the bag went through 2 rainstorms on a 10 hour trip and no water was found inside the bag. Overall, great puchase."
2,Looked good - Heavy duty Construction POOR Quality Buckles,"Ordered this car top carrier, as I didn't want to have the hassle of storing a hard sided container. Product arrived quick and appear to be very heavy duty. Summer time use, so none of the difficult zipping issues noted by other buyers. HOWEVER, the buckles that hold the straps to the roof rack came undone when any sort of tension was put on them. I have to zip tie them closed to make this product useful. SO I suggest that if you do buy this item, you do it well in advance of your trip, test the hardware! Now I have to figure out how to do a return?"
2,"Oldie, but ...","I have a copy of this software and I installed it (again) today. It will not work on 64-bit versions of Photoshop -- the plugins will not appear in the filter menu at all. Also, it will only work on 8-bit images.I reviewed this on a 32-bit Photoshop CS4 running on 64-bit Windows 7.One of the most frustrating things about this product is that the designers never figured that displays would get any larger than they were at the turn of the century. The work area is like viewing the world through a soda straw. You can't resize the windows (too hard for the developer, I guess).I think a lot of the effects provided here can be done better within newer versions of Photoshop.There are a lot of Photoshop plugins that mainly make your original look worse. This is probably better than that, but with the design limitation mentioned in the last paragraph, and the total lack of support, and a very high asking price, why bother?"
5,bathing suit,"I bought this suit for my daughter at her request. She is a dedicated swimmer. She described it: Very nice, good quality and color."
3,Fine little book,"Well worth the money. More precise explanations could have been used in the definition of ""coupling"" between matter and energy. Hadrons are not defined.Quantum fluctuations are glossed over but then, I have never seen them satisfactorily explained in any popular book. Also, why not say that the number of primeval neutrons is less than that of protons because the former are unstable and decay? A good book with few flaws."
2,Needs moderization,"This book contains SOME very helpful information, but the info is simply not well organized or very readable, i.e., specifically, it could truly use a wholesale re-editing & modernization of its presentation and content. Over 20 yrs. have passed since the book's publication, and most of the material would benefit substantially from a contemporary presentation with ""reader appeal"" in mind, fresh examples, inclusion of a section on the important topic of rebuilding of trust (after extramarital affair/s), etc. This relatively expensive book is really boring, unexciting, and somewhat lacking in content, as is. That's a shame!"
1,Blurriest camera I've used - Beware,"Either the rave reviews here are from people shooting still lifes and landscapes, or roughly a third of these cameras are defective.If you plan to take pictures of people or other non-stationary objects, be prepared to throw out about half your shots - this camera has an extreme tendency to take blurry photos. One of the other reviewers set up myblurrycamera.com to document his experience with this camera, and he captures what you can expect quite accurately.One other thing - the box it came in seems cleverly designed to be impossible to close properly once it's been opened, making returns more difficult. That's just annoying."
2,Excellent Pictures. Prone to lens problems.,"This camera has excellent picture quality. However, this model is prone to having the lens get stuck or misaligned. This has happened to me twice - - once under warranty, once not. Unfortunately the cost to repair actually equated to a new camera. Look on the net and auction sites and you will find plenty of this cameras sold as is because of the lens having some kind of problem. Its a shame - I really liked this camera."
5,Best Point in Shoot not made anymore..,"When I bought my first Camera I made sure to do my homework. I got the Sony P100. When it got stolen I replaced it with the P150 and eventually P200. I have used many other cameras though, since I do photography as a side job, and NONE compare to these 3 cameras. To begin with picture clarity is perfect in any mode. It also has many more available functions than the ""more modern"" cameras. Unless Sony starts making these again, I doubt I will buy their products anymore. The newer ones offer less functions and the picture quality doesn't even compare.I'm currently on the market for another one of these. I just decide if I prefer the P150 or P200."
2,Very disappointed,"I used to have a sony 3.2 megapixel camera, which broke when it was dropped, so replaced it with the P200. I had taken a lot of photos I was happy with with the previous camera, so was expecting to be as happy with this one as I was with the old one, if not happier, given the improved resolution. However, while I'm no professional photographer, I seem to end up with many more out of focus or blurred pictures with this camera than I did with the other one - probably > 80% are ruined, but it's hard to tell that on the screen on the back, so you lose a lot of treasured moments. In addition, I often find that the flash illuminates the scene before the picture is taken, and so the pictures are often underexposed. This happens a lot, and is almost impossible to compensate for, which is very frustrating. I cannot recommend this camera, and will try a different brand next time."
2,not easy to use and blurry pics,"I have had this camera for six months to a year and at first when the pictures were bad (blurry, blue or orange tinted) I thought it was just because I had to learn how to use all the features. However, this camera seems to be impossible. At least 3/4 of my pictures are blurry. It has a very hard time if not in perfect conditions with a still subject. Even then it has problems. I think I have given it enough opportunity to take good pictures and its the worst camera I've ever had.The aspects I liked (which really don't matter if the pictures are awful) were that it is rechargeable and has a decent battery life, and it is compact and a good size. Its also pretty sturdy.I recommend not buying this camera. I don't think I will buy another Sony camera again."
3,Tempo is important,"I was pleased to be able to purchase the complete Nutcracker Ballet on one CD but it is at a cost. I do feel the tempo is too fast and there isn't even breathing time between each piece. In addition, the orchestra didn't sound as rich as true quality orchestras and recordings can sound."
1,Misleading...,I bought this video to use in my classroom. It wasn't until I received it in the mail that I saw on the side that it was BOOK THREE!! There is nothing in the description that says it's book three. Be advised - this is not the movie version of Orzy's original novel. I am SO disappointed!!
5,very good,"this item was a great price and the company hd done a great job t getting them to us before Christmas, th husband was very impressed"
2,Blade made in Taiwan,"It looks neat in the photo, the blade is not of the quality I would have expected in the past from Gerber, I guess they have lowered their standards, you get what you pay for."
1,Lasted less than a year outside,Promptly hung it up outside to show my pride as they went through the Stanley Cup tourney. And left it up the remaining summer and winter. Its now falling apart. Buying a different one now.
1,Do NOT buy this!,"Do NOT get suckered into buying this!I loved Iron Monkey, and the new DVD just released (3/02) is fantastic. So when I saw Iron Monkey 2 at Wal-Mart, I snatched it up. BIG MISTAKE! Iron Monkey 2 looks nothing like Iron Monkey 1, the cinematography is terrible, the color is terrible, the sound is terrible, and the fight scenes are mediocre and vague. It looks like it was made in the 70s using a beta camcorder. I was so disappointed I didn't even bother to finish watching it, and I gave it away.Save your money."
2,i've seen worse,this movie wouldnt be so bad if the first iron monkey hadnt been so goodi think the movies faults have been pointed out already so i'll move on to the dvd itself (which is my biggest complaint)some mentioned pan and scan abovei think the problem is that it isnt pan and scanit's just cropped like they used to do in the old days (early 90's and back) hehealso it looks to me like this movie went from video tape to dvdit looks (bad)and sounds that way tooi will reserve further judgement until i see it in widescreen
2,"Well, I Guess It Could Be Worse","So I'm out hunting for some new martial arts DVD's. I'm just about done and I come across Iron Monkey 2 ... I didn't even know they had an Iron Monkey 2. A quick review of the back cover reveals that this is a ""semi-sequel"" to the original. Uh, okay. I pop the movie in. There is no screen set-up or anything. What you see is what you get. The movie looks like an early 80's kung fu movie. Nothing like the stylish first. Yes, the movie is laughable and there is no real plot. I still enjoyed the movie. I took it for what it was...a kung fu movie. The only reason I rate it so low is because I'm comparing it to the first."
3,"Some stories are inspiring, most lack eloquence.","I found this book to be somewhat lacking in inspiration and encouragement. However, some of the stories are heartwarming and teardropping. The problem with this book is that you have to be in the situation where you need to be inspired without double and where you are at a tough stage of your life. I'm a happy person and reading this book didn't teach me much. It is just a hobbily read. I would recommend that you think of your situation before you buy this book."
2,Problematic with OS X Lion,"Bought this because it is a real pain when the Mac wireless mice don't connect, lose battery power, etc. Hope was to have a mouse which just plain worked.This works fine after the system has booted, but on a Mac Mini with the latest OS X Lion, it doesn't recognize it before login. Which pretty much defeats the purpose, that is when the Apple wireless mouse tends to be the most problematic.Google searching suggests that there may someday be a driver available for Lion. I would recommend making sure that is available before ordering this mouse for a Mac."
4,Really Good,The author obviously knows a lot about teenage girls. It was a really nice story to read.
3,Hmmmm.....,"For some reason, I didn't like this book as much as I thought that I would. All of my friends had been telling me to read, so I did, but it wasn't very enjoyable.It centers around a girl named Ellie, who is having problems with entering into her teenage years, problems which include having an undesirable boy chase after her and having crushes on unattainable older guys.When her best friend gets a boy friend, she makes up one of her own, and eventually has to come clean.But, to all the British kids out there- does all the stuff that's mentioned in the book ACTUALLY happen when you're thirteen in the UK?"
3,alright,Jaqueline Wilson's book; Girls in love is I'm sorry to say not my favourite book it was still of course very good and I would recommend it to 12-14 yr olds. I suggest you take your on view on things and knuckle as its going to be an emotional roller coaster enjoy this delightful read. :)
2,Spotty connection,"This router refuses to work regularly. Works great when it does but then, for no reason at all, my wireless will conk out and refuse to reconnect. It's not a range problem because I'll have a full signal when it does work. I thought it was just my computer (a Powerbook G4) but my roommates have the same problem. It happens abruptly, even when we're two fee away from the router.My computer tech friend couldn't figure it out, neither could the guys at Apple.It was hard to say what was really wrong with it because it works fine about 60 percent of the time. And then (this seems to happen on days when we really need the internet) we can't connect to our network.I can't rely on this product so I'm looking elsewhere."
1,Stay away from this one!,"This router is about the worst I have owned. Will not hold the signal. Went to belkins website and downloaded the new firmware were it also had a bulletin that said if you experience frequent dropped signals you are supposed to change the channel. Did that, still drops signal. Called Belkin and they had me switch everything back to factory settings. When I said your website says that this is the problem I was told ""You not need to worry sir"" Ya great. Well its going out to the garage now to see if my hammer will fix it. Wish I had that $100+ back."
1,Great Speed and Distance When It works,"I bought the Wireless Pre-N Router to use with my PDA. Most of the time it wouldnt even connect with the pda becuase it it would hang on the getting an IP. Even with no security or Access Control. When it did connect, I did notice a bit of a difference in speed and range. But it seems that this router is not very backwards compatible with 802.11b.The DHCP Client Tables would not update and my computer (wired) never even showed up in the tables. I have never spent all day trying to get a network to run right. This piece of junk is going back."
5,Not one problem in 3 months of continuous use,"This router has worked great for the past three months. The set up was a breeze. I have not had to make a single adjustment to that initial setup and it has not had one problem, not even a hiccup. Granted, I am working with Macs, so everything is easier, but I have used XP (on Macs, but still XP is XP) without a hitch as well. I have two computers regularly accessing the internet in the house (with a third occasionally chiming in) and this router feeds to every piece of the property, the coverage is great. The speed is great as well. I have not had one problem with this device yet and don't expect any to come. And at $90 it is a great router! If your experience differs from mine, you should probably consider changing operating systems rather than routers."
4,Wireless router,"Works really well, I don't know if the actual N router would be any faster because I have yet to try it, but this pre N works great"
1,dont waste your time,"I gave this thing 2 years to work, and it failed miserably. Firstly, if it gets hot, it crashes, and requires you to reboot it. This happened more or less every 3 to 4 days. Secondly, when I tryed to configure it in access mode only, it would crash, and become completely non-responsive requiring a hard reset of the router. Thirdly, it had this ""handy"" feature to automatically download and apply firmware updates - attempting to apply this feature also caused the router to crash, and required a hard reset of the router.I think it is accurate to say that I have spent hundreds of hours over the course of the last two years attempting to make this piece of junk work. It doesnt!In any case I threw this thing out yesterday, and I couldnt be happier. I replaced it with a Bountiful wifi router, and so far so good. Couldnt be happier.Hope this helps!"
3,Not as great as I'd hoped. Distance claims seem overrated.,"Got the Belkin about 3 weeks ago. Using a PC with XP. Setup was fine, but couldn't get good service 50 feet away in the house. Got a refrigerator and washing machine in the way. Went to the setup home page to change my wireless channel from auto. No improvement on channel 1, no improvement on channel 6. Changed to channel 11 and disaster. Channel never loaded and my computer was frozen. Did a restart. Did a reinstall of the router and nothing, router couldn't connect.Called support. Support took me through all the repair steps, then decided I must have a dead router. Exchanged router the following day. Same problem on new router.Exchanged router. Didn't try to change wireless channel. Still get only three bars in the room next to the router (1 wall--no real barriers except sheetrock) Still can't get any signal at the back of the house. I'm looking for a range extender."
2,overrated,"To be fair, it can get 3 stars, but I read a lot of good reviews about this router before buying one myself, while I am quite disappointed at this time.The setup and configuration are easy and the wireless stuff works fine. My main complain is about its lack of flexibility in configuration.To be more specific, I play online games and also sometime use P2P file sharing clients. The router keeps dropping legitimate packets even after I openned such ports in the firewall/virtual server settings. I don't complain that it tries to employ the heuristics to detect outgoing scans, but why doesn't it have a switch so that I can turn off this ""feature"" when I do NOT want it. Besides, when using P2P file sharing, it sometime get frozen and I need to reboot the router to get it working... and rebooting this particular model takes 60 seconds."
3,General ly working 802.11G/B router,"This is a great overall wirless router. But, however the Pre-N concept is still a debate as the Pre-N capabilities have still yet to be approved into the IEEE standard. I can use this as a general wireless router, but I could not get the unit to work out of the box for extended long range use. The long range use of this unit is standard at best, nothing to get excited about. The Linksys models work just as well. Maybe when the Pre-N standard is approved more support/performance will be available, but I am not sure."
1,Broke twice after a few months,After a few months of use it failed to provide DHCP service. After a couple tech support calls (the 2nd of which you have to wait for them to call you back so prepare to sit at your phone for a day or two) they sent me a replacement. The replacement did the same thing and I'm now sitting at my phone again. Meanwhile I bought a super-cheap backup router and it works flawlessly so I predict it will become my main router and the F5D8230 will go in the junk drawer.
3,HMMM GOOD AT FIRST TERRIBLE LATER!,"IT SEEMED TO WORK WELL AT FIRST, BUT THEN YOU START LOSING CONNECTION WITH LAPTOP'S AND OTHER COMPUTERS, THEN YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I WILL SAY THEY HAVE THE BEST SERVICE OUT THERE, NOT MUCH WAITING TIME ON THE PHONE AND THERE GOOD, BUT AFTER MAKING 5 CALLS FOR LOST SIGNALS IN A WEEK, I AM TRYING LINKSYS!!"
1,Doesn't seem to work with MacBook Pro or VoIP,"I purchased this router based on the review where a PowerBook G4 was used. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to apply to the MacBook Pro, as I couldn't get it working at all.Don't think ""Oh, this guy can't read instructions"". I've been a network engineer for twelve years, and have owned several SOHO routers in the past.In addition to being unable to connect my MBP (it could see the SSID, but not connect -- even without security), it also saw my AT&T; CallVantage traffic as a DoS attack, and blocked the traffic. Even after I disabled the firewall functions, it refused to allow VoIP traffic to pass. (On some forums, people have alleged that Belkin has been aware of this problem for months, without a fix.)Since this product is almost EOL, I wouldn't expect much in the way of firmware updates from Belkin. This product is just too flaky if you're not using Windows XP -- and ONLY Windows XP."
1,poor customer service,"I'm without words on how bad customer service is with Belkin's products. The wait time on the phone is 20 minutes and the email takes days. Belkin is a company that produces sub standard equipment not to last. No quality, just bugs!"
3,Great locations and fun weapons performances!,"Entertaining kung fu film, also filmed at the Shaolin Temple and the Pagoda Forest, featuring use of the ""Drunken Spear""."
2,timex women's bracelet watch,"This watch is very pretty, however, I had to return it.The face was hard to read, the catch was very tight, almost impossible to open and although the information claimed it had removable links to adjust the length of the bracelet, my husband and I were unable to see how to do that."
4,Those mouth of the south brothas are back!!!!,"The brotha's came hard again. Classic down south we don't give a *&(^ music that you can rotate in your ride from start to finish. Only beef is with the damn interludes. Why do artists insist on giving us these little skits every other song. If they are funny then cool but other then that I want tracks. Speaking of the tracks. I can not really find a song on this cd that I don't like. There may be a couple of sugary mouthed love tracks but the dirty south duo put a hard edged spin on it which makes it down. The joints to watch are of course. You don't want drama, Straght Caddillac Pimpin, We do it. Hell like I said you can rotate this from start to finish with no skipping except for the skits. Go out and add it to your summer selection you won't be dissapointed. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!"
1,18 minutes is too much,I am gonna make this simple. I watched 18 minutes of 18 fingers of death and had to stop it. This movie or whatever it is is straight garbage. Wheres Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle at on Demand please?
4,Great book for beginning to plan a trip,Recently purchased this book for my trip to Europe this summer. I will be spending almost 2 weeks in Italy and wanted to hike the Dolomites - this book has just enough information to give a decent background and trips that can be cut down to almost any length of time. Great starting point to start planning with!
5,great bakeware set!,Great Bakeware set! Really convenient to have lids for everything. I use a lot less aluminum foil and clear wrap so its environmentally friendly. Great for casseroles. The round dishes are great for making side dishes in like pudding or potato salad. Lids are great for potluck's and the leftovers can be put right in the fridge.
4,stalage Bayview or the human condition,"The cast of characters seem familiar, Col Klink is now Harvey Bains assisted by Sgt. Schultz in the in the form of Jane Edwards. Tom Ballard and Diana Trent are the good guys...us. Point and counter point Tom and Diana prove that opposites attract and when they do they join forces to battle evil in this world. Don't let the sometimes over done laugh track fool you, we seldom have so many deep insights into humanity posed in such small sugar coated pills. On the surface this series appears as a light comedy about old people, pure camouflage. Within the dialogue is dialogue, issues of faith vs religion, honesty tested by self interest and more. This series is well written well produced, well edited, very well directed and very well acted... WELL DONE!"
2,Not funny,"Love British comedies. Saw reviews for this one & purchased Season 1. The elderly lady is funny. Rest of cast not very funny. The dining room lady couldn't act to save herself, and the rest are pretty bad, too (son is ok actor, but again - he has a serious role). Smiled at the old guy once in a while - but again, not really funny. Realize the series may get better as it goes on - the episodes got better as the DVD progressed."
5,Two great actors with a wonderful supporting cast who make geriatric care so much fun!,"Waiting for God is a wonderful, thought-provoking comedy that brings together two very different personalities who find that, despite their creaking joints and graying hair, they share a common need to continue living life to its fullest! Age and societal expectations are not going to keep these two rebel rousers from showing their fellow ""inmates"" that life does not have to slow down just because you have piled on the years, and they do it with style, grace, and hilarious results! Cheers to Tom Ballard and Diana Trent! The DVD is a nice addition to my British comedy collection and I have had no problems with its quality. I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who finds gentle comedy to be a pure delight!"
2,Not for everyone...,"I personally found this book lacking in many ways...you may too, especially if you are not into the lesbian scene...otherwise it was ok."
5,grand daughter's favorite,"My grand daughter received this doll for her1st. birthday, and it has not left her sidesince. She is 2 1/2 now. ""Dolly"" has heldup to numerous washings and still looks good.She has been given other types of dolls butthis one has remained her favorite; soft, cute,and cuddly."
1,Expensive child's toy,Cobra HH 38 WX ST Handheld CB RadioThis radio as received has about 1/4 mile receive and transmit range. You need two I repeat two ac plugs. One to run and one to charge.
2,Not what I expected,Very flimsy and cheaply made plastic 2 way radio. The reception is okay and the range is okay if you are communicating with people less than 1 mile away. Kind of big and clunky like the old cell phones. I would not recommend this product.
2,Livro de técnica,"No tive muita pacincia para estudar esse livro. Ele tem coisas interessantes, as vezes me serve quando tenho que tocar alguma coisa (de algum outro livro), mas no sei muito bem uma maneira inteligente de digitar no brao.Fora isso, se vc no l muito bem (nada de tab) e no tem uma pacincia fenomenal de ficar repetindo exercícios com metrnomo, vai apenas jogar dinheiro fora.Muito melhor é o Jazz Guitar Structures, dessa mesma série, onde tudo é música de fato e imediatamente aplicável."
3,ZZZZZZZZ,"I walked by this anime at Blockbuster. I rented it, watched the first two episodes, and then I returned it the next day.It was very hard to get involved in this series, so I can not say that much about it. The characters were not interesting and the story jumped back and forth in time. It really got to be too confusing. I fell asleep after the beginning of the second episode. If you are a hard core fantasy fan, you most likely will enjoy it."
5,I think i want to be burried with this movie,"How great can a movie be anyway... not much grater than this onethis movie consist of 5-6 hours of glorious excitment. i read a game magazine that said and i quote""anyone who knows what manga is knows what Record of lodoss war is""if you like fantasy/rpg movie than buy this one the story is really superb. the anime is ok not dinosaur. the english voices is great ""john knox - Ashram"" has a really cool voice witch fits his character great.this is the best fantasy movie i have ever seen including ordinary movies like Willow and so on.the only sad thing is that the movie is only 5-6 hour's long"
5,An Amazing Fantasy.,Parn the knight and Deedlit the Elf travel with their friends across Lodoss fighting the invading Marmo. An evil scorceror is planning to resurrect the goddess of destruction and destroy the world. he resurrection requires the sacrifice of a high elf like Deedlit. The heroes have to find a way to save Deedlit and stop his plan.This anime was made in the 80's I think so it's pretty old. Even so it is still impressively drawn by hand. The voice acting is pretty good and there are lots of really cool characters. One of my favorite all time anime characters is the Black Knight Ashram. This anime is loaded with cool fantasy action and plenty of emotion. It's amazing. An oldie but a goodie! Definitely give it a chance.
4,Good Story and Excellent Animation - Worth the Purchase,"The Record of the Lodoss War is an earlier japanimation that was re-release onto DVD. This DVD release compiles the entire 13 episodes into one package of two DVDs. The Lodoss War Series is very typically of many japanime with plots within plot stories as well as brilliant animation added to the work. If you like deep plot lines and good animation, Record of The Lodoss War is a must for any collection. I gave it four stars because the story never discloses where the main characters came from in this world. Still the story builds to a climax and with multiple twist and turns throughout the series. I really enjoyed this release."
4,Enchanting,"Record Lodoss War seems to have been taken right from a fantasy novel. Dragons, wizards, knights, and monsters all exist within the story of Lodoss War. Although not that original, the story is good and will keep you watching until the end. I found that the music was espeically well done and even haunting. Symphonic tracks and great intro and ending music are all well done and engrossing. In fact, I went out and bought the soundtrack (a very rare soundtrack).Alas, Lodoss war is a title where the art is well done, the animation great, but the screenplay a bit lacking. I suppose they wanted to save time so they limited the amount of animation they had to do. The result is lots of close ups and other animation-short-cuts in action sequences. But this is but a minor complaint in an otherwise great series.If you like fantasy, D&D, or are an anime fan who wants a change of pace from the typical mechs and giant robot fare, this is a great series to get into."
5,My favorite anime to date!!,"Though only 13 episodes, the Record of Lodoss War OVA certainly has a well structured plot (based on Rio Mizuno's work), interesting characters and character development, as well as a great soundtrack; the animation style and voice acting (Japanese as well as English Dub) is fantastic also. Truly Record of Lodoss War is the best fantasy anime out there, as compared to the Slayers and others. This OVA is a great buy for any anime fan or fan of knights and fantasy."
4,Kaplan English Grammar,"Item arrived within the timeline and arrived as described. It was a little more than I would have liked to pay for it, but as far as textbooks go, it was cheaper than most."
4,A young womans adventure,"An early American adventure, the story of Tessa O'Donnell begins in seventeenth century Ireland. Losing an abusive husband to a barroom brawl, our heroine braves the Atlantic to begin a new life in America. The reader is kept in constant suspense as life winds it's way around the life of a young woman, alone in a strange land. Romantic, but not a romance novel, this story will be of interest to a wide range of readers, both men and women. Margaret Hodapp is an accomplished story teller. Her other books include ""Dearest of Friends"" and ""The Friendship Circle"". I'm sure we are going to hear much more about this accomplished author in the future."
1,Keep this legacy hidden....NOT a good read!!!,"Thank goodness I didn't purchase this book!! There were so many things wrong with the writing...as if someone was telling you a story you already knew, but after they guzzled a case of red bull. I kept flipping back wondering did I skip something, how did she get here? There wasn't an original idea in the whole book. The rich lady that favored her? The dying rich lady that favored her who's rich uncle died too? The spirit/ghost to the rescue?? The only time the author took time to be descriptive is when it came to Tessa's wardrobe and after reading about the first couple of outfits, I skipped the remaining outfit descriptions unless it had something to do with the regurgitated plot. The dialog was nonexistent or what little there was it seemed to be in the writer's head. I am deleting this ""book"" off my kindle right now!!!"
3,Nice & Classy Shoes,"These shoes are nice. I'm a size 10 ... but these shoes run 1/2 size too small in my opinion, hence the 3 star review. They are super cute though!"
3,"Worth reading, but not great.","The book is pleasing to read and good enough to purchase the second volume when it is published. However, the book is too factual. Similar to the history course that covers the 1600's in week one, 1700's in week two, etc. I would rather see fewer stories, but more depth. The quotes from Napoleon are great."
2,"Asprey's ""Rise"" Left Me Flat","First off, let me say that I am not an avid reader of biographies. But when a compelling, beautifully written biography like Edmund Morris's ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" or Antonia Fraser's ""Marie Antoniette"" comes along, I devour it happily. I did not find Robert Asprey's ""The Rise of Napoleon"" to be that kind of book at all. This is a military history, first and foremost. If you want to know (and can keep track of) every move of every division of every army in which Napoleon ever fought, or fought against, this book is for you. I wanted much more personal information, much more about the inner thoughts of the man and what might have made him tick. Nor does Asprey do much towards explaining the world in which Napoleon lived or the political forces that made him what he became. Honestly, I couldn't finish this first volume, and will certainly not go on to read the second."
3,"Lots of what & where, not much why.","Aspreys' book is an easily read chronology of Napoleon's life to 1805. It covers the Italian campaigns and Napoleon in Corsica well, but is less strong in the provision of background on France during the revolution. Asprey catalogs the events, but adds little insight or analysis."
1,do not buy,it is not the size of the truck's mirror its a pice of crap. i dont recomend buying this mirror at all
5,Great seller!,"Great product. Arrived in time and in perfect conditions, just as described. A pleasure to do business with."
4,Great Character Developement.,"This second, in what I hope to be a long series, is most interesting in that the main character is so reluctant to take on what he has to do. He is swept along by unfolding history, and his own inate capabilities, to become more and more a leader and man of consequence. A rich read!"
3,Kindle editing,"The book is interesting enough, but the Kindle edition is poorly edited, containing many format errors, lacunae, and even spelling errors. It really would benefit from the attentions of an editor."
2,My Visit to Agharta,This book is a compilation of chapters taken from T. Lobsang Ramps books and is an unauthorized publication according to the deceased author. He states that it is in one of his books.
3,why all the plaudits??,"The speakers on my pc don't work, so I sometimes buy a CD 'blind', based purely on amazon reader reviews. This method has uncovered several beauties for me - Nickel Creek being top of the list - but this one turned out to be a disappointment.It's a pleasant enough album to be sure, but the praise it has received completely baffles me - why buy moderate talent when you can listen to genius? (e.g. Nancy Griffiths, Alison Krauss...) There are two or three enjoyable tracks and her backing band is top-flight, but overall I have to say I found her voice unremarkable, the songwriting average, and the melodies predictable. I suppose it must have more going for it than I can hear, but I do suggest you listen before you buy."
4,The Nun's Priest's Tale,"This album sings itself from the heart of an intersate highway truck stop. Everything about this album (music, lyrics, voice, complexity, thinness) reminds me of a breakfast counter off the highway in Maryland where a chance encounter brought into conversation me, two women, a man with a big rig and a waitress with an unforgiving apron. Three hours and too much coffee later, we had all told our stories--none of them brilliant, none of them hopeless, all of them understandable, all of them human. Then we all went our separate ways, looking for whatever holy, blissful martyr our roads would let us meet. I'd recommend Laura Canterll precisely because she isn't flashy, pushy or phoney. She's just singing the country music I grew up listening to."
1,Title: Portrait of jenny,Title: Portrait of jennyPortrait of jenny by Dizzy Gillespie. This CD is a copy of a LP. You can hear the needle on the vinyl.
1,Needle drop without skill,"This is a transfer from vinyl. No effort has been made to use click repair to remove clicks, or even to properly clean the vinyl to decrease their number. Full of intrusive clicks and other vinyl noises, do not buy (and I have some tolerance for vinyl noises). You could get better results with a beaten VG- condition vinyl you could buy for a buck."
2,"Great cookie, crazy high price","I've really enjoyed these cookies, and came to Amazon as this one is hard to find. Much to my SHOCK the price is 60+ dollars.. and it shows they used to be 30.00 and some change? Huh?? Other cookies by Murray are more reasonable. No way will I buy them at this incredible markup :-P"
1,Murray Sugar Free Cookies Chocolate Chip with Pecan,"The last 2 cases of Murray Sugar Free Cookies Chocolate Chip with Pecan were over cooked almost burnt.. Date Code is MAR0810EAS. I don't have the code in front me But I remember MAR0810Exx?Murray Sugar Free Cookies Chocolate Chip with Pecan, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)"
5,wonderful alternative,"My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie withJell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me ""You know I can't have sugar."" and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said ""It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present.""It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle."
4,Taste great!!!,My hubby loves these cookies. He would eat the entire shipment in one week if I would let him. :-)
2,Not for Car Nuts,"Before purchasing this book, I knew it dealt more with the business end of Studebaker Corp., but being a Studebaker aficionado, I wanted the book anyway in case there was some new info on its life and death. Well, there was not and the cars were ignored to the point that the book may as well have been about widgets. With fewer than two hundred pages and a paucity of pictures, none in color and not one of the famous 1953 coupe, the book at its high price does not seem a good value. It must have been written for some scholarly reason; there are lots of footnotes, but not placed on the bottom of the pages. I was not impressed with the author's appearance on Cspan's ""Booktv,"" which is how I discovered the book. I should have stuck to my first impression."
1,Not happy,"I bought this TV as a replacement for my Sony CRT with price as a primary consideration. I got what I paid for. I had it less than a week when I had to contact Westinghouse customer service due to a corrupted display. They had me do a soft reset. I had to do many more such resets to recover the display over the next 6 months. After 6 months, the display developed a line across the middle. The TV has now been with Westinghouse for a month to be repaired under warranty - ""awaiting parts"" I'm told. I'm not impressed and would not recommend this TV."
5,FIVE PLUS STARS!,I loved this book and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in reading a hilarious romance.
3,I liked it,"I saw this one kind of the way I saw the maiden. Two people who are attracted to one another but struggle with lack of communication and mind games. But maybe that is what made the story enticing too. I felt that J.T. was so cruel to Aria, more then she asked for. I also felt that J.T. really didn't deserve Aria in the end too. It seemed that he treated her so disrespectfully that how could someone in real life fall in love with a personality like his?"
4,Improbable but Fun,"The delight of Jude Deveraux's THE PRINCESS is its improbability, but the caper is fun to read because of its humor.Just the thing for a swing and a glass of sweet tea as Aria, a princess from a small European county is ship wrecked and rescued by a Montgomery.Nash Black, author of SSINS OF THE FATHERS and WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS."
4,Warm Fuzzy,"This is nice accessory, I'm happy that I ordered it. It makes the seat more comfortable, and also protects the seat, it's easy to wash. The material could be better quality, it feels a bit cheap... And for the steep price, I would have expected better. Still, it's the only one designed for this seat and it fits perfectly, for me it's an essential with my BOB. Bottom line, I would recommend it."
5,Great,The miles gilbert bedrock glass bedding kit work very well.I use it on my 300 win mag (winchester Model 70) Blackshadow 1st gen.I also did my Winchester model 70 classic compact in 308. My 300 3 shot under 3/4 of inch at 100yrdI have not shot my classic compact with a 20'' barrel.
5,I cant decide,"I am not sure if I prefer Womans Heart or Womans Heart 2, but it really doesnt matter. I have both and I love them. Loads of talent and personality on both albums. Sweet, sometimes dulcet, tones mixed with skilful backing melodies...there isnt a dud on either CD."
3,Not terrific but somewhat entertaining,"I was expecting a supernatural horror flick and instead it was a gay version of Fatal Attraction. The production value is atrocious as is most of the acting. I did like the guy playing Corin, who is fairly attractive.Overall I would say this is a good film to watch if you're drunk or if you want to laugh when you shouldn't."
3,"It is ok, but..........","This CD is OK, however I was expecting a little more of a sound track type CD. So good CD, just not what I wanted."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!,"My title says it all!!!!!!! THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!! Every song on this album is a truly great song!!! I'm not a big fan of Joe Henry, but he did a great job on his 2 tracks as well. I recommend this track to anyone and everyone I know!!! Get it!!!!"
1,ASPARTAME,I dont even know why people still buy this crap . Its not made from sugar and no it doesnt taste like sugar . Thats misleading ! Splenda is made by man by bonding to molecules of chlorine to 1 molecule of sucrose ( LEMONS ) and then its ground down to a fine sugar like consistancy ! SPLENDA IS BS ! BUY STEVIA !
1,splenda = not so splendid,"From Doctor Colbert's book the ""The Seven Pillars of Health"":""Splenda brand sweetener is a substance called sucralose, which is made by turning sugar into a chlorocarbon. A few of the side effects of sucralose in animal studies include shrunken thymus glands, enlarged liver and kidneys, atrophy of the lymph follicles in the spleen and thymus, reduced growth rate, decrease in red blood cell count, hyperplasia of the pelvis, aborted pregnancy, decreased fetal body weights and placental weights, and diarrhea."""
1,Makes you ill,"Do not consume splenda. Research it and read how sick it can make you. I know because I was consuming lots of it in tea and over a period of time I kept feeling worse and worse. Muscle and joint pain and headaches were unbearable. It is poison, first developed as a pesticide. If you use it look for side effects."
5,Splenda,I love this product. Then Amazon came along and made it better by delivering it to my door. I sweeten everything with splenda. I highly recommend it.
3,Disappointed,"I have found many of the packages to be off-cut. This means many are already empty, or worse emptying themselves all over the counter and me. I realize this is typically done by machine, but it still does not make the product better. Where is the quality control?"
1,Read the Nutrition Labels!,"Read the Nutrition Labels folks and look at the ingredients! They have to list the ingredients in the order of their quantity. So whatever they use most of has to be listed 1st. And whatever they use least will be listed last. Most all of these sweeteners (and even some Stevia products) list ""Dextrose"" 1st and then the ingredient that you think you are getting is listed last. If you are buying this because you like the taste, then great. But if you are buying it for health reasons, do your homework and stop drinking the marketing cool-aid."
1,Splenda is not healthy,All u people using splenda need to research and look for an alternative. Once I read that splenda is derived from a failed pesticide that didn't take and when the chemicals had a sweet taste Poof Splenda was born. Try stevia it's natural and helps your blood pre sure and sugar levels. People please research...man gave you Splenda but God gave you brains and stevia. Please use them!
5,Must have for foreign cars,"Must have, I have a 89 honda accord and this is the easiest and safest unit I have ever used."
5,LOVESSS ITTTT,i love it go paris she rocks this cd is awesome BUY IT & YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats hot!!!!
4,A Fun Album,"No, this album may not be one of the best albums ever, but it's fun and catchy. I don't see anything wrong with that, it's something she wanted to do and did it. There's people saying that it's only good because she had good producers..so what? She's smart to do that. Not every album or song in this world needs to be deeply emotional or filled with a lot of meaning. Soometimes people just want to throw their cares away and enjoy life, not have to think deeply about everything they came across, including music. So that's what I think this album is..just something fun to listen to. It may not go gold or whatever..but sometimes it's nice to just enjoy the little things in life."
4,great guilty pleasure album,"If the Paris-Haters get the fact that this album is being sung by Paris Hilton, they would like it. But since people are stuck up and just decide to hate Paris, they don't give her a chance. It's a shame because this is such a fun record. The songs are catchy. Her voice isn't awesome, but it doesn't suck. It fits the songs perfectly. Does Britney Spears have a good singing voice? No. But does she still sell millions? Yes. It's just like that here.My favorite tracks: I Want You, Turn It Up, Screwed, Not Leaving Without You.Definately check this album out if you like catchy pop songs. This will definately be a guilty pleasure of many! Let Paris have fun!!!"
4,Anybody who gave this a one star review...,"...probably hasn't been lit up on ecstacy in a jam-packed, strobe-filled club with a sweaty half-naked chick grinding on them. This is Paris Hilton, not Tom Waits. It's a DANCE/POP RECORD, nothing more, and it should be judged as such.Having said that, it's a good dance record IMHO, and a helluvalot fresher than I expected. Don't like pop at all? Then don't review it if you can't see something for what it is."
4,i will buy anything that involves hot girls.,"I never liked the news, but now I find myself addicted as I watch Amy Robach. I decided to purchase the video game Need for speed 2 when I heard that Brooke Burke was in it. I have even found myself watching the weather channel when a big busted blonde is telling me about the fog in Seattle. Yes, I can't get enough. The only thing that can feed my need is the Paris Hilton album. Im not sure if it's her money, her sex appeal, or her money, but there is something that I love about her.I apologize, as I cannot finish this review. I have to get back to reading Jenna Jameson's biography. by the way, does anyone know who the president is? I missed voting in 2004 because I was watching America's top model. Oh well, I'm sure we are in safe hands"
1,Garbage,She should go to jail for this CD alone. What a joke! It's amazing what money can buy. It gets no rating from me.
1,Hold Up miss-independent,"Looke miss-independant, me and the rest of the haters are just angry that everyone calls this music. Calling Paris Hilton music should be an offense. Come on let's look at the actually record.1. The lyrics are stupid (of course she didn't write them) what she ever do in her life, have parties?2. She can't sing, she trys to and fails miserably. She sounds absolutely ridiculous3. Even the bloody producers that she hired because no record deal would dream about singing Paris Hilton can't make her sound good.And you consider this rubbish a 5 star album, I see so I suppose you must think Beethoven is 1 star. Look, do you actually think that anyone would sign Paris? She hired producer because she has money.If you also have read this clown and think that she's full of it than vote for me!!"
5,This CD is AMAZING! Paris is the new QUEEN OF POP!,I LOVE this CD - it has so many great songs on it - no filler! Every song on this CD is a great listen! Paris has worked with some of the biggest names in the music business - and it's proven with these incredible songs. I am looking forward to her next CD - Britney and Madonna... watch out!... Paris is the HOTTEST new musicical talent on the scene!!!
3,"We all know that Paris is no singer, but ""her"" album is enjoyable.","Paris' producer is excellent, he made something out of nothing. Paris is definitely no artist and this CD reflects that appropriately. I can definitely hear all sorts of modern music technology taking this CD over -- making up for what Paris cannot do. Having said that, I still enjoy this album. It is an easy to listen to CD, fun and addictive. ""Turn Is Up"" is quite catchy and has a beat to it, I enjoy cranking that one up. I am, however, very disappointed to find ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy"" on this CD. Paris, even with her highly paid producer, cannot pull that one off. That song should never have happened with Paris."
1,Turn It Down- Aaaaaaalll The Way Down,"Anyone who buys this CD is a sucker. I wouldn't even waste my time buying it at a used CD store for .99 cents. The good thing I'll say is that Paris looks beautiful on the cover, and that's pretty much it. The music is shallow and her voice is like diet Jell-o. Anyone who reviews this CD and types more than one paragraph is a total lame. Believe me, it's not necessary."
1,Another one bites the dust!,"What happens when you put the most untalented female in the world with the most untalented producer/songwriter (Scott Storch)? You get 40 minutes of complete garbage that makes even the Spice Girls look good. Seriously Warner Brothers, have you no shame? Your record company's joint venture with this tabloid bimbo is a complete insult to true artists and singers everywhere. One star is one too many."
3,handy but...,"disappointed with the quality and price. I received as a gift and a couple of pieces of plastic were broken off inside the drawers. Since the giver did not include a gift receipt, it would have been more trouble than it's worth to return. I like the layout but the quality and price are less than desirable. I do not like the fact that I still have the other brands lying loose in the cupboard. I would not recommend purchasing this unless you are a Boiron devotee."
4,"Good Value, Good 2 Speed Pump",Pump arrived quickly.Installed it without a problem.2 speed capability is great. I use the higher speed for vacuuming the pool and lower speed for daily water circulation/filtering.Running with out a problem.Value was excellent.
2,Police Assessment Center Preparation,"Find this first on the used market if you can and this should not be your first pick for police assessment center preparation. It is very generic and spends too much time on the overview of the process. Candidates for promotion do not always need to know the legality of an assessment center nor the reasons some agencies select them as a testing process. Law enforcement professionals competing for promotion have little choice in the agencies decision to use this process and normally little time to prepare. When compared to even an ARCO Sergeants test prep book, the three chapters on assessment center exercises were more concise and informative. It does include good exercises to familiarize yourself with the process and the author's advice is consistent with others."
2,Thought I would get a good one,"Had this switch since early March. Resets about once or twice a day. Not good with VPN connections. The case is very hot and I feel that is contributing to the problem. Called support, got India of course. When it does work, it is quite fast. Using with a mix of broadcom and dlink gigE NICs. Will request an RMA and see if replacement unit is better. This is likely the last straw with Dlink products. Two prior routers had issues and support is terrible."
2,OK for occasional use,OK for low cost rain gear. Sizes seemed to run a bit small. Plastic is very lightweight. OK for price paid.
4,"Great Movie, but missing a key scene!","I loved this movie and remember seeing it on cable in the early 80's and it did have some scenes not seen on cable. That was cool, but were is the scene with the prince! Sorry but that was the best scene in the movie it was not on the dvd got. Still very good."
1,LIES,"One brief example: Aristotle could not possibly have stolen his ideas from the library at Alexandria as claimed, since he died before the library was even built.But of course fans of this book and its author don't care about the truth.Point that out and the name-calling begins."
5,Great Book - like stepping back in time!,"Reading Bill Band's book was transportation in time. You get to know some of the young heroes who, with fire in their hair and determination in their hearts, were the Flying Tigers. Bill is a wonderful story teller, as giving of the truths of his own trepidations as the heroics of the 'Tigers' exploits. You can feel the adrenalin rush. You can see the tracers. And when you come back with a Japanese sailor's hat in your intake, you too will experience the thrill of combat - and the relief that you survive!"
2,doesn't do as described,"After receiving this I tryed it and it didn't make viewing my trail camera pictures any easier. You can hardly see the pictures once you finally get them up on the small screen. Definitely way too much money for what it is. Then requested a return and received a phone call from seller. Not comfortable with that, don't know how they got my phone number. Still haven't received my refund. Would not recommend this product or seller."
1,let's be honest...,"this guy isn't a comedian anymore and is merely the latest in a string of psuedo-sarcastic, bigoted, mean-spirited rightwing talk show hosts. it's a shame too, cuz he used to be funny and intelligent"
1,"put a fork in this guy, cuz he's done","he's turned into yet another rush limbaugh wannabe. not funny. that's why they have to pay audience members $15 to sit through his CNBC show and laugh at his jokes while people like eric alterman rip his ill-concieved, overnight rightwing conversion apart like the sham it is."
1,"sad, washed-up, sell-out","a formerly intelligent, funny comedian who deals with career death by dumbing ican politics overnight, blindly sucking up to power, advocating nuking civillians, and spewing racism while appearing on Leno nearly every night--a disappointed former fan"
4,A Real Charmer,"Andi Watson gets better with each project. His brushwork is a marvel of economy--the minimal style skillfully conveys subtle expression and mood for maximum impact and insight.The story itself is fairly straightforward. Katherine, an aspiring American screenplay writer, heads to England to log some time at a local newspaper as creative fodder for her project. She partners with prickly Owen, and keeps in touch with her ambitious boyfriend back in the states. Conflict ensues and lessons are learned.The ending is well done, if not a complete surprise. What makes this book shine, though, is the complex characterization that Watson imparts through dialogue, story and art."
4,ingenious,"Particle accelerators are well described in this book. One of their biggest objectives is to maximise the beam luminosity, so that when the beam is incident on another beam, or a target, the maximal number of reactions can happen. But the problem is that if the beam consists of charged particles, then these are usually of the same charge. Hence space charge effects can act to force the beam apart, either longitudinally or transversely. Neither is desirable.Reiser describes many beam focusing techniques that have been developed over the decades to circumvent this problem. Quite impressive ingenuity. Some of the best experimental physicists have gone into this field, and their efforts are well summarised here.Other non-accelerator applications are described. Though perhaps the most interesting to some of you have to be omitted by necessity. These are military applications, where particle beams might be used as antimissile defenses. (Star Wars.)"
4,Better than other Let's Go guides!,"I've always been a faithful Lonely Planet user, but my old standard didn't stack up to this Let's Go. Since it is the 2004 edition, it has much more updated info than LP, and I've only found one mistake so far (that being that a camping store supposedly located downtown is not there because it looks like they're turning that block into a parking garage). It's only other downfall that I've noticed is that it's a little heavy on the nightlife side, and I'd like to see more of the suggested walking tours that they have in the front of the book. Otherwise, it has my reccommendation!"
1,Horrible,"I had taken Mandarin in the past, studied it on my own though various resources, so I wasn't flying in blind. Mainly, I've used the primary 2 texts. I don't understand why this is now a text, which was the text for my last college class. The video content (if you can get it), is actually decent, but it just cannot justify how horrible this text is. I've actually decided to opt out of Mandarin studies at my current school, because I just think this text is that abominable. I'm going to study privately."
3,Many Misprints But Still Useful,"This book does have many misprints. The author has a partial errata list on his personal web site. The book is still a useful hands on introduction to differential forms.But why is Amazon.com selling a paperback at a price much more than other sites are selling the hard cover? In fact, is there a paperback?"
4,good introduction,"The language of differential forms presented at the level of this student-friendly text provides a refreshing outlook on vector analysis. And with a view towards more advanced courses, this book hints at the remarkable computational prowess it bears on differential geometry at large.In light of the author's heuristic approach, the book does well in setting the stage for the applications he has in mind (casting Stokes' theorem in its true form, for example).One should then go on to read books like Do Carmo, written in a similar vein, but this time, delineating the algebraic machinery needed to set up the theory in a more rigourous framework.Have fun!"
4,Verrrry niiiiiiiiice,"I really like the product, took roughly 5 mins to set up, no tools. not entirely sure how to attatch the shade.. but I don't look at directions, and they went out with the trash. Very comfortable, I do have to use a pillow though under my back to help with a little neck strain, but maybe I haven't sat in it long enough with out the pillow to figure out how to sit it so it doesn't bother me.. but it's super awesome, that's the only complaint I have. And also the reason for the 4 stars. Well that, and I paid 200 for it.. and well, I hate spending that much anyways, but I will have this for a long time to come. :)"
2,Not worth the money,"We bought this for Christmas and just spent a couple of hours trying to get good results from it. The white foldable box is a nice idea but it is very wrinkled. The seams with the walls, along with some random alligator clips attached on the inside, are clearly visible in the photos we took. The bottom doesn't lie flat on the table due to the rounded hoops providing the frame. The light diffusion is a decent concept but the shadows are still visible. We got better results simply draping a white sheet to form a floor and background, with no sides. Save your money on this item and get a sheet."
2,Good material poorly exposed,"A bad book is like a bad friend, can take you places you do not want to go and make you do things you do not want to do. Any author should have two assets good knowledge of the material to cover and good to excellent writing skills. The authors have a good knowledge of the subject at hand and give good references. Unfortunately their technical writing skills are very poor. The beauty of technical writing has been destroyed. Using their terminology, a freshman could have done a better job. By definitions handbooks are very concise and clear. This one tells stories about unrelated matter in order to explain simple facts. Please save the trees ."
3,correction,"to correct the review from a music fan in New York. It is MICK KARN not Nick Kern. Not much of a music fan really, methinks!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"Despite the quality of the playing, there is an intolerable amount of hiss on the recording. It sounds like a direct transfer from vinyl. Horrible! Horrible!"
3,Like All Movies And Love All Horror Movies,"Poltergeist 2: The Other Side 1986 Part 2 Is Here And There Back For More. But This Time It's Another Hole New Cast. Grandmother Dies, Daughter Is Not Missing And The Horror Contenuies For More Blood And Schocking Detales Of This Story Plot. The Indian Helps Them Out And The Walking Dead Man Comes For There Little Daughter.And There Son Goes Along For The Ride."
2,Scarrier than the first one but disappointing !,"I will say that compared to the first Poltergeist, that this second volume could have been more interesting.Sequels are still a problem and rarely, they finally look better than the original.The story of Poltergeist 2 is not very believable indeed. It talks about a preacher and a cavern...(I won't tell the story) while the first episode was about a removed cemetery... They can't just create a new story without relation with the original one, but they do !!Anyway, I personally like the nasty old guy and the plot is in my opinion scarrier than the first film if the direction and the script had been better. Unfortunately, it's not the case.The FX (at the end especially) are quite disappointing.I will add that it is a boring movie ! A pity, some ideas were good !"
3,Works after modification,"I put this on about 2 days ago and noticed right away that the trigger sticks, or rather, the bolt sticks and needs to be pushed forward about 1/8 of an inch in order to push the sear forward. I took this to a nearby shop and had them look at it. The guy there really knows his stuff, and after several minutes of experimentation, he found the problem.The hole in the trigger that holds the retaining pin for the trigger return spring is too large. The pin falls out after working the return spring a few times. The one for the original trigger is much tighter and can only be pushed out with a small tool. The solution? A larger pin, or rather, clamp the pin in a vise and flatten it a little.I gave it a 3 star because it is a good product, aside from the one manufacturing flaw.P.s. Anyone living in San Jose, CA should check out Cutting Edge Paintball at:176 Race StreetSan Jose CA 95126(Half a block from the fish market and across the street from Pizza Hut)"
3,Trigger Trouble,"A few of my friends bought this same trigger kit for their tippman guns, and it fit perfect, without any problems. However, this one seems to be a bit warped, so it took a long time of finagling to finally get it in place.It works great, just beware, that these triggers are NOT the highest quality."
3,Good but not Great,Alright first off I have ot say it arrived very fast like 2 days and its here. When i put it in my gun the gun would not fire when the trigger was depressed turns out the metal part of the trigger was holding the sear back. After about 30 mins of carfull fileing now it works perfectly. Thing is I should have never had to file it in the first place. Like I said in the title its good but not great.
5,A FAVORITE OF MINE,I happened to see this book and bought it online. I could not put it down! I let a friend borrow it and he read it all the way through in about 2 days. Then his wife read it. We loved it.. POWERFUL!!!! A tear jerker. I bought more and gave them away as gifts. Dont pass this one up!
1,Garbage,"What a total waste of time this book was. I read, or should I say endured, about 60-pages of it before wanting to throw it out a closed window. No story-line, just some incoherent ramblings. He would have been better to take the year off and do a creative writing course."
3,Insiteful yet the style is frequently clunky,"Duane does an excellent job of relating about the history of the sport and certain famous characters such at Noll, Foo, and especially Dora. At times he expresses some abstract idea admirably well; however, at other times his prose is murky and perhaps indicative of the various bong hits the author admits to during his year of surfing.Yes this is a worthwhile book to read, especially for the tidbits of scattered historical trivia and an exposure to the Northern California surfing culture. I actually enjoyed some of the natural history descriptions and understand how being close to the elements is as much a part of the allure of surfing (for some of us) as is the actual act of catching and riding waves.Unfortunately, the ending is really weak and actually ends with ""Nah.""! For all of Duane's philosophical pontifications, surely he can close better than that!"
2,A review by a surfer for other surfers,"I have just finished Caught Inside and I must say, this is pretty thin. I have been surfing the California coast for twenty two years in and around Santa Cruz and I haven't seen a fraction of the things that Mr. Duane has claimed to have seen. I think what we have here is someone who invested a year of his life surfing and still didn't have enough interesting material to put together much more than the same stories we all have about good days and bad in the water. In order to stretch his content he did some research and came up with some really good material about the history of the California coast, weather and wave dynamics and local flora and fauna. The rest seems pretty fictional with implausible conversations which occur while surfing breaking waves, stereotypical depictions of locals and main characters, forced wannabe guru-ism and a hyper alertness that notices and relates every detail of earth, sea, wind, plant and animal."
4,The Fallingnest,"I have to say that, as much as I like The Fall and have enjoyed adding many of their albums to my collection over the years, if I could have it all back I would buy this compilation and be done with it. Well, I might have to add This Nation's Saving Grace as well. In fact, the exclusion of Couldn't Get Ahead is the only reason I'm not giving up the 5 stars this best of probably deserves."
3,It doesn't have English subtitle,I'm disappointed with Amazon.com listed incorrectly under DVD Features having English subtitle. This DVD doesn't have any subtitles at all! I returned the item to marketplace seller for full refund.
4,Good general information but only for container growing,"I enjoyed this book, and it has good general information on gardening; however, I was disappointed because it is especially geared to small, city gardens grown in containers."
5,can't wait,This book makes me want to get out there and plant! Great advice for starting from scratch and full of all sorts of useful little tidbits of info and fun extras that relate to gardening.
4,Pretty great and helpful,"I only gave it four stars because it is mainly geared towards people living in the city without any yard. I have a small yard and could use some more advice on how to utilize it properly. However, the book is fantastic in it's detailing of how to do it all: make compost, fix your soil, pick your plants, plant your plants...Very helpful and informative to the new gardener. I just hope I can pull it all together and make it work."
5,Actually quite a good shred album for a change,"Full of energy and well composed tracks. Whilst the shred era was really at it's peak in the late Eighties, this album sort of keeps it alive."
1,bad bad bad,these belts are terrible. For the same price you can get an excellent belts on many web sites such as trugrit.com.
4,Timex watch,"I ordered this watch for my Husband for Christmas. He needs a watch that can take a beating, and is not expensive incase he does break it, because he is a Cabinet maker. This watch fit the bill. However I was not too pleased with the Chelsea watch Co. because it did not arrive in time and I was not notified of any problems. when I finally checked on it it was too late to get it for xmas but reordered it and it did finally arrive by the 6th of Jan."
3,Women's Fashion Flapper,"I ordered this costume for a '20s party, Chose an XL because I wear a size 12-14 (sometimes larger in the bust) but was pretty disappointed in how flimsy this costume was made and how short and tight it was. It was not too expensive and I would have kept it but it was so short I couldn't even bend over to pick something up let alone sit in it. I returned it and the company was great about crediting my account and accepting the return. too bad, it is a fun costume."
2,Two thumbs down.,"This dress was not of good quality. As I walked across the room, I looked like I was shedding fringes. Also, the cloth used to make the dress was cheap."
2,sized incorrectly,"It did not fit. It was much smaller than measurements stated. I had to return it. would have liked it if it had fit correctly. Fabric stretched, but fringe trim did not!"
1,Too small and cheaply made,Sizes were incredibly inaccurate and the material felt as if it would tear on the first washing. I just expected a little better quality.
4,Perhaps the best option but could be better,"This is a good reasonably priced product but I have two complaints: First, it slides on hard surface floors a bit. It would help if they add rubber feet. However, there are six small holes on the bottom that you could add your own rubber stops to, which I may eventually do. Second, I was hoping that the channels for the wheels had 3 different widths. Narrow road wheels slosh around in the groove a little more than I'd like. Overall, this product offers a slight improvement in stability and levelness over a bare tire on the floor. It's worth the price, but not exactly essential."
2,Flawed,"I have a mixed home network with 3 100bt connections and two gigabit PCs. If I mix speeds, the D-Link resets itself every 10 seconds, making it unusable. I replaced it with a Netgear GS605 and have had no problems with that."
2,MC 60 Motor control board,"The product is fine, I guess, in my case it would not fit the product it was reported to."
3,Early Stage of The Cult,"This was the first of three stages of the British goth band that would become The Cult. The songs are not the best written or developed that you would hear Ian Astbury and Company write years later. Most of the songs are pretty forgettable in fact. The two standout tracks are ""Fatman"" and ""Moya"". Gothic rock fans may recognize these titles as being included on some gothic rock compilations released in the 1990's. If you want to hear what The Cult sounded like in the early days, then try this one. However, it is not an essential purchase."
1,The fall,It was listed in among the group Saving Grace It was not the group notm even close I have no chance of listing to this group nor do I know any one who would like this.This should not be listed as a group because of the Title My SEARCH WAS FOR THE GROUP SAVING GRACE.
1,what a load of rubbish,"This album ranks with 'Bend Sinister' and 'Cerebral Caustic' as the worst thing the Fall have ever done. Drivel. I've only given it one star because there's no option for 0.Go and find some Fall stuff from 1979-1983 or 1987-1994, you're wasting your money here."
4,"Review of ""For My Lady's Heart",I really enjoyed this book. Laura Kinsale has an amazing abilty to tranport you to another time and world. It was an amazing read.
3,"I am still a ""Kinsale"" fan!","As much as I love Ms. Kinsale's work, I was a little dissapointed. A very long reading for someone who could not put a Kinsale's novel down before. When I read a historical romance, I do not expect accuracy, just believability and this book took too long for me to arrive to the conclusion.Nevertheless, MS. KINSALE....WHERE ARE YOU? I HAVE BEN WAITING FOR THE LIKES OF ""THE SHADOW AND THE STAR"", ""SEIZE THE FIRE"", AND ""MIDSUMMER MOON"""
1,Couldn't even finish this!,I tried. I tried. I really did. But I just couldn't get into this book. I don't like having to re-read every other passage to get the meaning of it. I don't want it to be such a darn struggle. And I certainly don't want to read pages and pages of boring stuff just to get to something that may be interesting. This book quickly became a chore... And what's the point of that?
3,a little misleading,"I enjoyed the DVD but thought it was going to be about Autism for the full 60 minutes but instaed it was only about 15 minutes and the price I paided was too much for that amount, I did enjoy what I did watch."
4,Very nice,"Easy to clean stainless. My favorite part is the handle which is comfortable and good looking. A big improvement over a lot of other stainless handles that look good from the front, but put no effort into the back, and waaaay easier to clean than the stainless products that have silicon or rubber handles. My only complaint is that it's a bit pricey, but I haven't found any decent alternatives for less."
4,GREAT SCORE!,"This show is brilliantly written. The music is challenging to play, but well worth the effort. The songs are so satisfying to sing! I use some of the songs to audition with, and they are show stoppers. I reccommend this book if you are a singer looking to add some fantastic songs to your repertoire.Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath"
1,"worst ""movie"" i have ever seen. ever.","Wow. I am surprised they allow movies this bad to reach the shelves of blockbuster. This is a serious stinker. Like, really bad. Not even a 1 out of 10. It is so bad it's not even funny, and believe me I wish there was one redeeming quality but there is not. I never write reviews but this is sooo heinously poor that I must warn others not to plonk down $3 to rent this unmitigated disaster. Horrible. If you see it, pass and never look back. It it terrible."
3,I've seen better.....,"But I've also seen a lot worse. The movie had it's fun moments. The problem is it's a YRV movie trapped inside an R rating. It was boring at times, and the ""plot"" didn't really make much sense, but it had it's moment of being a little scary. Maybe it's just the other horrible movies I've seen (*cough* Rest Stop *cough*) but I didn't think this was that terrible.Then again, it definitely wasn't that great."
3,It is what it is...,"With the element of surprise being paramount in the success of scaring you in a horror film, this one does not succeed. It's fairly predictable. I kept reading how great the special effects were going to be in this film, but I was disappointed in that aspect the most. The film does have some unique moments and Tobin Bell gets more screen time than I was first led to believe. It did not exceed nor fall behind my expectations. In my opinion, the actors did a respectable job with a weak script. There wasn't a lot to work with."
3,Only one problem,The sticker on the pack of the keychain left distortion =/I wish they didn't put the label right on the product.
1,Not Helpful,"I am reviewing the review of this book. Beautiful and oversized it may be, but how about specific information about the textiles shown. A review should give information on the content of the book, not just its appearance.If the book lacks information to accompany the photos, the book is just decorative, not useful."
2,Buyer Beware,"This is a stereo SACD not a 6-channel remastering. It's nice, but if you've heard 6-channel, it's somewhat disappointing."
4,Nice puppet,Bought this for my 10 year old who loves puppets. It is a good size. Looks cute. He is having a blast with it. No problems at all.
1,Terrible service,"Paid for 3-day shipping on Oct. 16. E-mail information from FansEdge consistently said product would be received between Oct. 19-21. I didn't receive it until Oct. 26, well after the event I needed it for. Afterwards, FansEdge tried to tell me I received it EARLY because it had been backordered to November 1.No one at FanEdge ever dealt with me personally about this matter. I will never deal with these liars again."
4,"Excellent rat traps, work great.","The Snap-e are excellent rat traps, they work great. Easy to set, and the proof of the pudding is that they actually kill rats. Highly recommend."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about Soapmaking...,"... but were afraid to ask!!!Be afraid no longer! This book contains almost everything you need to know about making soap! For once, truth in advertising! This book boasts clear instructions for the beginner, and suggests new ideas for the experienced soaper. If you buy one book about making soap this year -- heck, EVER -- The Everything Soapmaking Book is the one to get."
2,Just a giggle,"A found it a struggle. Put it down many times but eventually made it to the end. The odd 'giggle' yes, but I expected better. If you really want a good one and laugh, get 'No Shoes Allowed' by Jan de Groot."
5,Nice upgrade,I love my A-5 and this upgrade make it look awesome. Its easy to install i did it myself in about 15min. great add on for paintballers.
4,Tippmann A5 Double Trigger,A fantastic trigger for any paintball gun. It has a very natural feel to it and it improves the appearance of your A5. I can't argue too much with the price either. . . .
2,Not the BEST Motoring - JGTC,I was hoping for alot more action of the races but very little racing and alot of other stuff!Certainly not like BTCC or WTCC with alot of action. We don't get to see alot if any of the Japanese racing in North America so I was looking for an action packed DVD. It has some short moments and that was it. I was disappointed.
4,The methods behind the goals,"This book is a companion to ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"", which is a wonderful, life-changing book. ""First Things First"" picks up where the previous book left off.""7 Habits"" is a book that presents a perspective and philosophy. ""First Things First"" follows on with practical ways to put the philosophy into action. Don't expect new insights, but the methods are practical and valuable."
3,Could be better,"Good, but overly summarized. I know if I anta a complete explantation I have to buy the book, but the could be a little bit longer."
1,Philosophy and Personal Time Mamagement,This is a very strange book: it isn't a book of philosophy and it isn't a book for practice on Personal Time Management.If you are a CEO or a Vice president you could find something useful (but we hope you've a philosophycal background far more interesting than this book suggests..) but if you're a down on the earth worker .... forget it! When your chief demands the impossible ... explain her/him that you're a value oriented people and .... find yourself ... fired in 2 seconds!!!
4,Worked for an older child.,But the cd that came with it was funnier to listen to than just reading the booklet. Although the pictures were cute & colorful.
3,difficult book to put to film,acting was good however I expected more. when reading the book I was aware of the actors who were cast in the film so I imagined them as I read. so the film I imagined while reading was much better than the real film.
3,There are some stories that should be kept privately in the imagination...,"There are some stories out there that should be kept privately in a person's imagination by reading it in the book. Attempting to present the story on the external movie screen does not do it any justice.To give my opinion simply: The book is amazing - one of my absolute favorites, but the movie is a disappointment. This is not to say that they did not put enough effort into the movie or that it really could be improved, because this is one of those stories that I believe is just portrayed best in the written form where you can imagine and interpret it as you wish."
4,Looked and sound very good,"Picture and audio quality were fine on ""The Time Traveller's Wife;"" I have no complaints on that score. As for the movie itself, it's good but not great(haven't read the book). Eric Bana seemed a little flat as the Time Traveller."
1,Crappy,"What a super crappy movie! Terrible ending, what a bummer. Don't buy if you value your emotional state at all. :P"
5,Good Movie,Was a little hard to follow at first but once it got into itit was a good movie. I would recommend the movie and the seller to a friend.
4,great movie but...,i wished the ending had been a different one instead of the one they used in the movie oh well
5,Justice illuminated!,"Ms. Straus presents a series of case histories from her experience as an assistant district attorney dealing with some of the most heinous crimes imaginable. On the face of it, these would each seem to be outlines for the plots of further episodes of Law & Order: SVU! On the contrary, with seemingly effortless prose, she educates us about our legal system and its intricacies. She relates each case with sensitivity and an appropriate measure of humor. This reader is convinced that Ms. Straus served her clients with dignity and sustains belief in the merits of our judicial system despite the degree to which it is taxed."
3,Quirky tableware in an otherwise well-written book,"I was misled by the cover of this book thinking that the tableware inside would be clean, simple and elegant. I couldn't be more wrong. I find many of the pieces featured looking weird and overly-decorated. Maybe that's what the author means by ""distinctive"". This is my greatest misgiving about the book. Otherwise, the author did quite a good job explaining the basics of pottery (with helpful tips along the way), guiding the reader on how to make tableware to suit the four seasons, and demonstrating the surface decoration styles of four different artists. There is a glossary at the end of the book and appendices detailing cone-firing ranges and glaze formulas."
2,Does not meet expectations,"Great idea, cheap quality. The pieces of the space shuttle come apart easily it is very frustrating."
2,shuttle comes apart,"The pieces of the space shuttle replica don't stay together, which is very frustrating. The pieces are made of plastic and seem fairly durable each one on it's own."
5,All went smoothly,"I chose Amazon.com because this was the cheapest place to get this set of struts. I already have the Eibach Prokit lowering springs but could tell the stock damping didn't really match so I ordered these. Package arrived in a timely fashion with no issues. Installing these is a piece of cake, especially the rears. For the fronts you do need a spring compressor but here in Canada we have Canadian Tire who has a free tool rental program. Rented the spring compressor for free, which is also easy to use and that was that. If you're not at all mechanically inclined though, just get a shop to do it."
1,Will Make Your Dog Sick,"After seeing on a dog show, dogs chewing on tire toys, we bought this toy for our 10 month old Rat Terrier. In spite of the terrible odor, we played tug with him and that was okay. Later we decided to let him chew it. In very little time, he had little pieces chewed off, so we took the toy away from him. Not long after that our puppy vomited. And since we are not as smart as our Rat Terrier, we played tug with him again the next day, and again let him chew it. And again our poor little puppy threw up. I would stay clear of this toy!!!! For your dog's sake. It is not a chew toy, and what dog doesn't chew!."
2,Durable? Try Dangerously Edible...,"Did not hold up to the pet monster's chew attacks. He chewed a huge hole through the rubber tire of this one and ate the rubber...not a good look. Threads are also coming loose and the toy has a moderate rubber odor. Not a one star because virtually all other toys (except the ""ultimate dog bone""!) have been completely destroyed in a matter of minutes."
5,Top Gear!!!,Great series these guys are great and so funny. it's endlessly entertaining for anyone who is a big gear head.
2,"Lots Of Hits, But Some Bad Misses","True this phone has lots of bells and whistles, but there are some glaring problems.First, the outgoing message recording quality leaves a lot to be desired. It is so weak and tinny, callers don't recognize my voice. They think it's a wrong number. Next, the display brightness and contrast are too limited, making it difficult to read at an angle. You must be staring at it head on. Third, when dialing in from the outside and entering your code, there are no prompts for the system, other than playing messages. Not even one for deleting a message, going back one, skipping ahead, etc.. Unless you carry the 95 page instruction booklet around with you, you're helpless. And last, but not least, there are occasional bursts of low volume, high frequency noise on the line. Not enough to disrupt a conversation, but enough to be a nuisance.Even though you get a lot with this system, given its relatively high price, it leaves too much to be desired."
1,This is celluloid at it's worst.,"Don't waste your time. This movie sucks and has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES. AWFUL! Even fast forwarding to try and find ONE GOOD ZOMBIE SCENE was a complete failure. Again, don't rent this absoloute piece of crap."
1,"Boring, Terrible Acting","This movie was horrible, and not in a good way. Awful acting. Terribly boring. I got 30 min into the movie and turned it off. I wish I had read the other reviews before renting this movie!"
3,Steve's Review,"I have to say that this movie was better than I expected but at the same time it's amazing to me that a movie would have characters in it that didn't have a clue about zombies. Is there anyone out there that doesn't know what to expect during a zombie outbreak?? What's the first rule oh yeah, double tap to the head! Anyway, the movie is about a cleanup crew cleaning up some murdered activists for a gangster one of which turns out to be a zombie! There is some black humor in the whole premise but I admit I have a very dark sense of humor. If you don't have anything better to do this movie is worth a look as a rental but I wouldn't buy it."
4,The most recent studio effort,"This is the most recent studio effort for Love Like Blood. More recently they have released an album of covers, paying tribute to bands that have inspired them over the years.Enslaved/Condemned is consistent, yet a little uneven in the quality of songs. Some songs are definite standouts for me, while others kind of blend into the mix. If there is ever another 'best of' by LLB, it would be strengthened by these songs: Silver Shot, 7 Seconds (by Neneh Cherry), Bleeding, and a couple others whose titles I cannot remember without seeing the tracklist.Most of the rest of this album is not filler, just typical, less-memorable LLB gothic rock songs.Definitely worth the time of LLB fans, but not necessarily their best effort (check out Snakekiller)."
1,zipper broke on both books ordered within 2 months,"Our company has purchased many of these books in the past from MMF. The last two books I ordered in January 2011, the zippers have broken and I am not able to return them! DO NOT BUY - IT WILL BREAK."
2,"If you read Marine Sniper, don't bother with this one...","Henderson managed to rewrite the same book, give it two titles and sell it twice. If you read Marine Sniper, you've already read this book. Same stories all over again, only with fewer or different details, and some fantasy about the enemy characters. Henderson also had an annoying way of referring to himself in the third person toward the end of the book. Kind of a waste of time to read both books."
3,Child Loved It!,"My 3 year old son received this puzzle as a gift from a friend and he was very excited to carry it around in the Thomas tin, and look at the picture while he was putting it together. Great Fun!"
3,A good buy for die-hard B e M fans,"This is my first dvd exposure to this Brazillian duo. I had higher expectations of it. They sing most of their best songs live, but Bruno is the disproportionately dominant partner of this duo. I have yet to see Marrone's voice come to its right. I also feel when you do your well known songs like ""Deixa"" and you can't duplicate the sound of the studio recording, you need to at least give a better alternate take on it. Not so in this live recording. They use no props in this live show either.... again compare with the brillian other Brazillian duo, Zeze Di Camargo & Luciano's live performances."
5,Beautiful & HEAVY - designed to last!,"I purchased these primarily because I wanted metal measuring cups that were all one piece (that didn't have handles that were spot-welded on). I was skeptical as to whether or not these would be worth the price tag, but they certainly are! They are very sturdy and very heavy for their size, and clearly designed to take abuse and keep on working. I also like that they will stand up and not tip over if I set them down on the counter. One thing to note - since they are so heavy, I can't keep them clipped together, since it's just not practical to heft that much weight while measuring things. My boyfriend loves that they are dishwasher-safe."
1,Disappointing performance and quality,"I purchased this blade because it appeared to be the best one I could buy at the home center (it was the most expensive). I placed it on my new tablesaw and made some cuts. I thought something was wrong with my saw because no matter how carefully I fed the material through the saw, I got a poor cut.I aligned my saw and called the saw manufacturer's technical people for assistance. They said, ""Try a different blade."" I protested a bit and told them the blade in the saw was brand new. Eventually, I complied and installed a dull, used Freud blade in the saw. Despite being dull, it produced a better cut than the new Oldham Signature blade. I returned the blade to the store.Since then, I have invested in a Forrest WWII blade. Although it was much more expensive, it was a great choice. Don't throw your money away on the Oldham. There are much better blades available."
1,Very disappointing,"These freebie ""classics"" are almost always a mess on the Kindle. They are clearly not proofread or edited and are filled with misspellings, typos and poor formatting. I really looked forward to rereading these favorites from my childhood, but they are extremely disappointing in Kindle format. Shame on whoever produced them."
2,you have more power sucking things up with your mouth and a straw!,"This has no vacuum power. I go over and over the same spot, just to have the dirt on my car floor mats sit still as they laugh at me. I bought this unit because it was cheap. In this case, you get what you pay for.Worth paying more to get something that actually works."
3,"Um, fits ONE hamburger","These Foreman grills are nice. Do a nice job, separates the grease, Even cooking, but don't buy the hype on size. This grill will fit ONE burger at a time, not two. (unless you have pixie burgers) Buy the bigger models, preferably with that removable dishwasher safe grills"
4,Great product,"I purchased this grill for work. I am now the envy of my coworkers at lunch time. It's small and easy to use. Heats up quick and I can cook an assortment of things on it. Perfect for one or two people. Saves on lunch cost as well!!My only problem is I think the setting is off because I can already see where the Teflon is wearing from being bumped by the raised grill. Other than that, It's GREAT!!!"
4,MY KIND OF MUSIC,"IF YOU LIKE GUITAR INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC, IF YOU LIKE GOOD OLD JAZZ, IF YOU LIKE LISTENIG TO OLD FAVORITES OVER AND OVER, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CD."
1,Thank The Previous Reviewers of Sweet and Low Down,"Would have loved to get this CD, but the consistently disappointed reviews of others (CD tracks not true to the film) have scared me off. Mr. Allen should have another go at it...."
2,Not exactly a movie soundtrack,"I purchased the cd to listen to the guitar music featured in the movie and was disappointed to find many of the cuts were not solo guitar music at all. Many of the cuts are orchestrated versions of the guitar music we heard in the movie. I've always considered Woody Allen to be an unknowing underdog looking for a fair shake. But, after watching a great movie with great guitar music, I realize that Woody is a business man that sometimes sells the audience a bill of goods."
5,A Model of Popular Science Writing,"Morton Hunt has done a masterful job of explaining meta-analysis. Not only does he make a complex statistical technique accessible and understandable, he also provides an interesting history of the method and of its founders. I recommend this book both as a practicing meta-analyst and as a keen reader of popular science writing."
4,Better than Cuban Links.,"Positives: A much better album than his supposed classic debut. The beats are far better and Raekwon performs better without Ghostface on every track. ""The Table"" with Masta Killa is a personal favorite. ""Casablanca"" is also one of Raekwon's best. ""Sneakers"" is like no other song I've ever heard. It's a cool idea to dedicate a whole song to shoes. The highlight of this album for me is the songs with the really tight beats.Negatives: The two tracks with American Cream Team are pretty weak. The song ""F**k Them"" with Method Man has a really bad chorus but decent rapping. I was a little disappointed to hear a Meth feature that isn't very good."
1,"YET, ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT FROM THE WU-TANG","Reakwons first album was without a doubt a classic, untouchable. There is only one place you can go from the top, and that is down, far down. This is nothing like I expected from a rap assassin like Rea, this is just sloppy and thrown together, and to release it the same day as Dr.Dre and Kurupt, dumb career move, actually, the album was the biggest disappointment of the year, I thought it would be off the hook. Reakwon and the rest of the Wu-Tang are done with (except Meth)bring back the old Wu."
2,Don't expect a good album,"This album broke my heart after ""Only built 4 Cuban Links"".It was so bad that I tried to get my money back - and I bought the album FROM A BOOTLEGGER on Canal Street!!"
3,New Raekwon Better then Cuban Linx?,"Before This came out I heard it was gonna be phatter then the his old album, Well somebody was lying. This new album is no where near as good as the old album. What happen rae?"
4,raekwon top mc,"I have not been a wu-tang fan for a long time but this album is tight,there is not 1 bad song on the album. The only reason i didn't give it a 5 is because it dosn't have a outstanding song, dont get me wrong the whole cd is great but if it had a standout song it would be perfect. Raekwon is one of the best mc's out today and this album shows why. The only mc's that are on his level right now are Rakim,Nas and a few other wu-tang members."
4,Quality dado set,"I have used this dado several times, and it makes clean accurate dados. I would highly recommend this item and its reasonable cost makes it a great buy."
2,Surprisingly average,"I am surprised at the number of rave reviews this book has received. It was poorly written and the lead character, Felix, was too thinly drawn to be engaging. If you're interested in the psychological effects of war upon soldiers then I would recommend The Forever War or All Quiet on the Western Front, not this pulp fiction."
1,"I couldn't finish ""Armor.""","""Armor"" is poorly written. Characters come and go, people do things for no apparent reason, you cannot bring yourself to give a hoot about...whatever the main character's name is.I read through the first part, which is sufficiently action-filled to cover up the shortcomings of the writing, then lost interest and moved on to something else.Read ""Ender's Game."" It's vastly better--it even stacks up well against non-sci-fi books."
2,"2.5 actually, it started off well, became painful","I thought this book was great when I started reading it but half way through Steakley starts writing a completely different book that has a horribly boring plot. This should have been a much shorter book. Don't buy this book, buy Starship Troopers instead, it's a far superior book."
3,Put it on your 'must read' list,"Finishing the book ought to be a requirement to writing a review! Would anyone here put stock in a movie review if the critic left in the middle of it? Would you listen to a sports announcer analyze a game when he left the game at halftime?Slow at times but decently paced, Armor will satisfy if you are a sci-fi lover, military junkie, or just looking for a good read. It's thick, but worth the payoff in the end. I keep extra copies to GIVE to friends, not just loan out (no kidding)."
5,superb,"this is one amazing book, ive read scant few books twice but im working on my third time on this one. theres many twists and misadventures along the way and shows what people in the pit of combat face (namely lack of intel) and what happens when one fights an unknown enemy."
4,Continuation of an Excelent Story,"Armor is not to be compared to Starship Troopers, but should be thought of a contiuation of the story thought of by Robert Heinlien. John Steakley got into more depth with the aspects of every character than anything Heinlien ever wrote. He also made the the characters more interesting and desirable to the reader. There is nobody that read this book that didn't root for Felix at any point in the plot. This is a grade A book for anyone who loves SCI-FI."
5,My Favorite Book,"Armor is the best book I've ever read. I usually don't read Sci-Fi books but my brother made me read this. Felix is the best character I've ever read about. To the author, don't do a sequel to this book because you can't beat the first book."
1,Awful,"Poorly written pornographic fantasy trash.I bought this because it was likened to the Forever War by Joe Haldeman and because of all the positive reviews. After 25 or so agonizing pages, I chucked it.In one laugh out loud paragraph the author describes the lakes of Banshee (alien planet) as made of poison. Just poison? Why not acid? Or blood? Both of those would have been cool too."
3,"in some ways good, other ways bad","Steakley is really good at suspense and making characters that are real. He also does a nice job of describing the war scenes in ""Armor"". However, he leaves way too many plot holes open in the novel, and at one point undertakes a huge jump in the story line that is hard to grasp. If your looking for some good war science fiction, try reading Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"" (which by the way was a lot better than the movie)."
4,a must read,"this is a great book! I agree that the Jack Crow part is not great, but Felix is the best. All you nag heads that compare this to Troopers, did you ever read when this book was written? it was long befrore troopers came around. maybe troppers was based on this book?"
5,best book ever read,"I've read many books and enjoyed them all. Armor was the first war book that i have ever read and it was so great it might be my last. The way Steakly set up the book and and had every piece add up till the end is the best type of writing i have ever seen. Sarting out with one part, than goin later into the future, than back and forth. It was the best book that i have read and i hope to read many more of his books."
3,It was not worth 5 stars.... Come on people,"This is average science fiction. Pure and simple. It is worth reading. If anyone who gave this book a 5 and read Dune, The Hobbit, etc., they need their head examined.The Jack Crow chapters stunk. The fighting on Banshee made the book. Very good word craft. Brings the whole book up to average."
5,Highly recommended,"These men clearly are intelligent and well-informed on the topic. It's not a breeze to read, but I don't think it was intended to be. Fascinating analysis of business ethics. I've read other articles by Grote, and I'd love to see McGeeney publish something else. Highly recommended."
1,Bad disc quality - Do Not Order This CD,"I love Depeche Mode, so ordering this CD was a joy for me. That all ended when the disc arrived at my house. It skipped on almost every track. So I sent it back to Amazon and they sent a new one. The new disc skipped even worst. It's sad when a large company like MCA Records can't even burn a CD correctly these days. Now the disc sits in the truck of my car. Sending it back again just wasn't worth the hassel."
4,"Great songs, but missing so much early stuff!","Everything on this CD is great but it's really missing out on the fantastic early stuff. For the casual fan this is actually a bigger issue than it is for the completists; you probably already own all the albums. My advice is to buy this and ""With Sympathy"" and consider yourself covered."
1,TINY! SO NOT WORTH IT!,"This was a ripoff. It is tiny. The size of a pack of gum. You can get a huge 16 oz package of modeling clay from Walmart for 3 bucks. Do not buy this, even as a stocking stuffer. I returned it, just because the idea of paying 5 bucks for this was appalling to me."
4,A challenging work out depending what ball you use,"When it comes to working out, I do it regularly, however I made the mistake of not starting out light and working my way to a heavier ball. I started with the 6 pound ball and that was extremely challenging for me. I was sweating bullets by the time the work out is done.I have ordered the 4 pound ball and will start with that until the 4 pound becomes too easy for me to use.Overall its a very good workout, and challenges all your core muscles to the max."
3,Original Third Reich Nazi Recordings,"It was nice to hear some of these pieces from a historical point of view; however, the quality of the recording was lacking and quite poor to be honest. It is too bad that current conditions prevented ""us"" from having better quality. Perhaps in the future this will not be the case and, for historical purposes, we will be able to listen to music from the past with out variances in volume and ""scratchiness."""
1,The Early Minstrel Banjo,"I bought this book and am totally lost. It clearly has huge potential but why are the tunings of each piece not mentioned? Every tab I have ever seen describes how the banjo is to be tuned for that particular piece such as, ""gDGBD"" being the most common. However these are not anywhere to be found in the book. How is one to know how play the tune? Have I missed something? It must be in the book but I can't find it. Page 19 gives a general account of certain tunings in the 19th century but that doesn't help you when you come to a tune say on page 200. I must be missing something because no one would write a book of TABs and not mention what tunings they are supposed to be in. That would be like asking someone to spell a word when they don't know the alphabet. Can anyone help me?"
1,Very naive,"Arundhati Roy's essays present a simplistic view of the issues involved in development and in defence. (You need to invest on security, India has some very dangerous neighbors.) Roy's analysis of why India's development has been slow is just plain wrong. Basically, she parrots the Marxist view, which refuses to recognizes that India's problem is its bureaucracy."
1,Bigotry,"A homophobic, sexist text from a narrow minded religious bigot. Just read the chapter on avoiding the ""risk"" of homosexuality. He even bemoans the 1973 decision to remove homosexuality from the formal list of ""diseases"". Other right minded readers have highlighted his anti-women stance so I wont repeat them. Avoid this book."
1,Wouldn't reccomend,"I agree with a previous customer reviewer - this was not what I had in mind. My husband and I are very traditional, but we were both offended by the anti-homosexuality stuff and anti-working mother stuff. While there might be some sound advice in this book, I cannot in all good concious reccomend a book which proliferates an attitude of hate and intolerance towards people who think differently than oneself. The challenge to raising children, let alone boys, is to raise loving, accepting children with high self esteem, who do not feel threatened by people with differing beliefs. I didn't get anything like that from Dobson."
1,Be Informed,"Before you buy this book, you should know who Dr. James Dobson is. This is ultra-conservative. His ""observations"" have no basis in education, psychology, or any other respectable science. They are purely based in his own right wing conservative relgious agenda for this country."
5,A Book Written By A Father who Loved His Son,"This book has much to offer both chrisians and non-believers alike. Dr. Dobson uses many statistics that are NOT based on any kind of biased surveys or age, race or culture. The majority of his opinions are biblically based, but the bible never hurt anyone. His ideas are clearly expressed and there is a sense of hope through out the book. Despite many other reviews, there is no woman hating, narrow-mindedness or non-intellectual material used. This book is a wonderful guide for those who are concerned about the well being of their son among a society of girl power. I suggest reading this book, or excerpts before judging it too hrashly."
3,mothers and sons,"I agree with Dr. Dobson's message that boys are facing tremendous trials in our world. I feel, however, that he is a bit heavy-handed when discussing feminism. I agree that radical feminist ideas have hurt men--they've also hurt women--but, I don't believe they are the main source of ill in our world. If anything, it's the breakdown of the family (which he discusses) and the fact that our world has mostly turned from God. I also don't agree with his assessment that mothers ought to become bystanders in their son's lives after they reach 18 months. I hope mothers everywhere will look to God for personal insight on how to raise their sons; He knows better than anyone the needs of our boys."
1,It's going in the trash!,"How about we all just accept our boys for the beautiful, unique people they are! Don't waste your time or money with this book."
1,Promotes Homophobia,"A friend recommended this book to me, I then blindly purchased it. Once the book arrived, I excitedly read the jacket and realized there was a section on homosexuality. We live in an urban area and many of our friends and family are homosexual so one could say I am impartial....Anyhow, I thought it would be interesting to see what this author had to say about homosexuality. Evidently he thinks it is a mental illness and that one can be ""changed"". I did not read further and while my friend thought I should read the rest of the book to see what I could ""get"" from it...I begged to differ. Would you read a book about religion written by an anti semitic author? How could I read a book written by an author who clearly disregards so many individuals' genders??(This gets one star because Amazon requires a rating of some sort and zero isn't an option!)"
5,Great Advice for New Father,"If you have a boy, I strongly recommend you read Bringing Up Boys. It provides thought provoking information and it may cause you to reevaluate your priorities in life, especially when it comes to raising your child"
1,Nonremarkable,"For all the money Dr. James Dobson was no doubt paid to dispense this expert advice, he spends a great deal of time on ""the latest research."" More often than not, this comes across like he's more content regurgitating the material of others than sharing original ideas.Clearly the book is written toward women, which is disappointing considering that (as a father himself) he had a golden opportunity to really deliver something that would specifically hit home for dads. Didn't happen.It's also a book that goes on for way too long. The retail price of this book is a joke. It could've made it's key points in booklet form. The writing is also dry and lacks any flair.Overall, an unworthy effort."
2,Truth in Advertsing,"Title should say ... ""according to the Bible"" ...to explain why mothers should backoff at 18mo age. What people need is balance, and if mothers are 'observers' the boy will think that all women are to be passive. Be selective (obviously) how you take the suggestions ... its not the gospel truth."
1,"Oh, please","The book does contain facts...it's just that the conclusion Dobson draws from those facts is biased, flawed, and mean spirited at times.But folks, let's remember that this book was written in a different era with different issues. I'd like to see how his thinking has evolved over time then perhaps he'd seem less of a caveman. I managed to complete the book and there were some enlightening points (as a new step-mom unacclimated to boy behaviors), but as a female (even a conservative one) you'll find yourself outraged at times."
1,Bias and conditional acceptance,"Sadly, James Dodson has continued to provide his biased and denegrading perspective toward people outside his narrow and 'conservative' perspective. It's too bad God's unconditional love he claims to call upon does not extend to his beliefs in raising, mentoring, and bring up healthy boys."
2,Closed minded,"It was a great book for half of the book - and then I hit the chapter describing how gay people just need to be 'cured', and I had to give up the book to someone else who'd not have a problem reading that kinda language!Guess that's the trouble with reading books from 'traditional religious' authors!"
3,Take it a Bit Further/ Caveat,"Expecting our first son, my husband and I bought this book on the recommendation of a neighbor. It presents what we felt is a realistic look at the ""Feminization"" of our current culture fairly well. In fact, I think there is much more yet to be written on that topic. That said, we didn't come away from the book with much in the way of concrete suggestions.We might add a caveat for the traditional Catholic reader: the author presents a view decidedly against Church teaching when he ventures into sexual topics. To be fair, he himself apologizes for his views, should he offend here."
2,The Gospel According To Morons...,"I was pi**ed off after reading the first chapter. Hoping to get some good advice on raising my son, I found myself receiving moronic views on life, religion, and kids in general. A hardcore purveyor of ""Spare the rod, spoil the child"", this guy thinks you should kick your kids a** everyday. If you don't like beating your kids all the time, you probably won't like his point of veiw. I was raised in the church but don't warm up to hearing others skrewed up opinions. Just because some minister says it, dosen't mean it's true. Don't waste your $$. Another product of our lame society believing these so-called religious leaders who are getting rich off their stupid opinions."
2,huge disappointment,"I had big expectations from this book, tips on how to raise boys to be precise. Unfortunately the whole 300 + pages will mostly be useful to those who are interested in statistics and sophisticated language. It is just rambling about social issues. The author is defending conservative views throughout the book. There is no need to defend them, I already agree with them. There is nothing new, no details on bringing up boys. Waste of money, waste of time.As for working mom issue. He suggests that moms work from home. Work is work. Working from home and dealing with kids all day is even more chalenging than leaving them in day care for 8 hours. That way kids do not get the attention they need, work suffers and mom is struggling."
1,Not what you expect,"First of all, it is brushed nickel look PLASTIC, not metal. Secondly, it says not to expose it to steam - hellooooooooooo! What shower doesn't produce steam?"
2,Came with missing pieces,"Fun content, missing pieces. I wouldn't have purchased this if I'd known that some some of the Tangram puzzle pieces were going to be missing."
4,"Good pedal, bad noise.","I got this pedal for christmas and the first thing I noticed is its change to the tone. Even when all the knobs were turned as low as they can go, it made the sound seem more crisp. The only bad thing about this pedal is the bit of extra noise it produces."
2,Don't wast your money,"I bought this book based on the reviews and browsing the book online. I have been knitting for years and am very disappointed in the book. It does have very cute patterns, but that's about as far as it goes. The author instructions are vague even making reference to looking on the internet to learn a stitch. It's nice to know what's used for the pattern in the photo, however unless you have ready access to a large yarn shop you are pretty left on your own to figure ply and weight. I've made two sweaters from this book, I won't be making more I'll be using my other books. I rarely write reviews but really feel this one needs to be commented on."
4,Happier ending,"This is a good anthology of Red Sox writing, but none of these excellent writers is able to change history so that the Red Sox win THE BIG ONE once in awhile. Read Bill Lee's The Little Red (Sox) Book to see a whole bunch of happy endings told in a hilarious way by the one and only Spaceman!"
5,Good way to observe the world through time,"Really awesome book showing things not found in a normal school-issued atlas or textbook. The maps are incredibly detailed and informative. The book's pages are large and broad showing vast amounts of area. Colors and icons can be deciphered easily showing cities, capitals, and empire boundaries; and on the side of the map is a synopsis of the history period. Don't hesitate just buy it. I have no complaints!"
5,Great little mp3 player,"Creative Zen Stone 1 GB MP3 Player (Black)I have found that this is a great little mp3 player to have around. It has a great sound to it for rock, country, and classical music. Also with some Jazz and Blues music. The bass on the Zen Stone is good for the product. The cost is way better that what most people spend on a i-pod and I feel that the sound quality is just a bit better than that of apple's i-pod. What the i-pod does can also be done by the Zen Stone and it is more affordable than what the i-pod is."
5,Zen Stone Rocks,"I'm a bit of an electronics junkie--I've owned four mp3 players. Gotta say that the Zen Stone has been the easiest to use by far, and the cheapest! I have seen people say the controls aren't as tactile as they might like. I haven't personally had that problem but could see how someone with larger fingers might. My only complaint about this player is a problem I've had with every mp3 player I've owned--the shuffle is woefully inadequate. It seems to me like whatever algorithm is used to create a random shuffle on players is never random--seems to play songs from the same few artists and albums and then switch to another few. But, that's really the only problem I've had. The price is right on this player, it's EASY to use, it's tiny and adorable, and absolutely perfect for the gym!"
3,Needs a display,I bought this primarily to listen to books because of the WMA digital rights support. I would not recommend this for books though. There is no screen to see where you are in the book. It is nice to see where you are in the book.
4,Great quality sound and a fantastic price.,"I bought this product through the Pepsi promotion and I am overwhelmed with its high quality sound. Several of my friends are wanting me to get them one after they saw it. I had a minor problem setting this item up. However, I sent an email to the manufacturer and they responded by the next morning with simple instructions which let me figure out what I was doing wrong. It has been working wonderful since then. The sound quality is very good with the included headphones. I had bought some aftermarket isolation headphones anyway to make the bass stand out even more.I don't think you can go wrong at this price for a unit that holds 1GB of music. I have 74 songs on mine and some are over 8 minutes each."
3,Good little MP player.,"This item was a perfect replacement MP3 for my daughter. She was leaving on a trip and her MP3 was worn out. It was an affordable, quick replacement."
1,poor quality mp3 player :-(,"I bought this pink zenstone from Target for a very good price, and was ecstatic about the simplicity of the design...and the small size.Until I took it home, charged it on my computer (which took almost 3 hours). The songs downloaded with ease, and needed no software (which was a great bonus), but when I played it, the battery died after 5 minutes! :-( I took it back to Target,got store credit and paid alot more for a Sony mp3 walkman, which was well worth the extra money!This zenstone is a great concept, but the quality needs to be greatly improved."
5,I love it!!,"This is the first mp3 player I have and I love it! It looks great. Very easy to transfer music from CD or computer to player. Even for a technologically- challenged like me. Also, the charging time is pretty fast. All in all, this is a great product, perfect for working out, jogging, and traveling."
2,Do Not Buy This Item,"This is not intermediate, but rather beginner. The tapes are not helpful. If you want to learn the language, then purchase a textbook and find a Russian friend. The vocab tapes are fine, but the phrases are so basic that it is nearly insulting to an ""intermediate"" level speaker."
5,A Marriage worth waiting for HR # 3796,"I loved this book, Selena is so sweet and shy, Morgan is so in love he can't see straght.Morgan wants Selena back in his life, he is too macho to admit it.But Minna and Em have a plan, and boy is it a funny one.Morgan doesn't think he wants Selena until he finds other men who want her.We never found out just what Minna and Em did, but we saw the results and it was so funny.This book made me laugh and cry.Selena was so mistreated by her mother she didn't know what it was like to be loved, but her love for Morgan wasn't the secret she thought it was.But Morgan's love for Selena was everlasting."
3,A ton a nice songs but not enough variety to keep it entertaining,"This CD contains a lot of good songs but it's difficult to listen to in a single setting. The songs are well crafted, the singing is great, the lyrics are as good as you'd expect and the production is really good, too. The problem is that the overall sound is just too repetitive. When I gave it a listen in the car during the commute to work, the songs seemed to run into one another. The overall impression is pretty boring. And that's really the opposite of what I was expecting. I had to take a break from it every other song or so in order to listen to the whole thing. My final take is that this will be a great disc to copy to my MP3 player and shuffle in with other artists. That should avoid the overload and allow me to enjoy a good band playing some pretty good music."
1,This Microwave is awful,"The George Foreman Grill is great. I use it 2 to 3 times a week. The microwave is awful. It heats my dishes more than it heats my food. I've burnt my self on 'microwave safe' dishes only to find that my food is luke warm after heating for 3 minutes. Also the clock is slow. I set it for the correct time and 2 days later it is behind by 5 minutes and gets progressively worse. Needless to say, we are buying a new microwave next week. Buy the grill, not the microwave."
4,Great movie!,Great story that highlights the actors talents. SWS is a good actor and perfect in Goon. Written by Jay butachel it was well timed with action/comedy/romance. I will reccommend this movie to my friends.
2,Didn't even finish this movie.,"I watched just a very few minutes of this movie. It just didn't keep my attention. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because Seann William Scott was in it and I love him as an actor. He usually cracks me up, but not in this movie."
4,better than Slapshot,"This could have been just another dumb sports comedy but instead they created something interesting and unique. Yes it's crude and incredibly violent but it's smart too. Of course most importantly, it's hilarious. It's an opera. It's slapshot meets 100 days of summer. Liv Schriber is fantastic and Sean William Scott is perfect. I don't understand why this movie wasn't more popular. It's definitely worth renting."
4,Hockey diversion,Great little diversion from those with severe hockey withdrawal. Entertaining comedy for those who enjoy a good scrap on the ice. Watch the chiclet tumble to the ice.
4,Goon Good,"A touching story that I felt was very well played by Jay B. The movie was a surprise in how well it came across, would have given it 5 stars except that I am grumpy today."
1,No worth the $$$,"Had this for about a month and then, as a previous reviewer said, the USB chord came loose and broke. Not the quality you should expect for the price. Save your money and buy another brand"
1,Don't waste your money!,"The microphone input on my Koss dongle never worked, and the output worked only briefly before dying. Moreover, the output sound was not as good as that from the headphone output on my MacBook Pro. After one use with my headphones, the device is now completely dead. So my rating is really zero stars. I'm glad that it seems to work for some, but I had no luck with it."
4,Love the soap,"I love this soap, and I was very excited to find it at such a reasonable price. My only problem was that the bar was broken when I received it. Not that big of a deal really, but I wanted to make the seller aware of this incident."
2,Overated melodrama,"On the positive side, this was a page-turner. I did read the whole thing, because I wanted to find out what happened to poor Matilda. But please, the male and female roles are so stereotyped! I just wanted to slap the modern heroine for being so stupid as to let these men dominate her life. This is fine for summer beach reading when you have nothing better, but it absolutely is NOT the best book I've ever read."
2,What a let-down!,"I love anything to do with time travel and approached this highly recommended book with great anticipation. The sections in the past although interesting suffered from some material from the viewpoint of characters other than the woman who had been hypnotized and was living this twelfth century life. How could that be? I would also have liked to know that some of the characters besides King John were historical BEFORE I read the book.Besides that, the modern woman, Jo, suffered from monumental stupidity. If two men are plaguing you with violence, including rape for heaven's sake you CHANGE THE LOCKS! Especially when one of the men has a key to your flat!The book was also about 200 pages too long since multiple scenes accomplished the same purpose, especially the modern day sequences."
5,Will Work For Poject Salvo?,"Just really curious if this is going to work the Tippmann Project Salvo, please get back to me soon, looking forward to buy this kit and the TIPPMANN Cyclone RT Adapter Kit"
4,"Good Product, But Doesn't Work Very Well W/ Compressed Air","Worked awesome with co2, unfortunately didn't seem to do the trick when I switched to compressed air. Be careful when tightening the valve screw on the right side, its plastic and WILL break if overtightened even a little bit. overall good product."
3,missing parts,"In the picture it shows a double trigger, but that is not included, double trigger is a separate kit. Also did not come with tube sealant, which is listed in the installation manual as included in the box. Also did not come with replacement power tube which is listed as included. Without the tube sealant you can't install this kit, so now I have to wait weeks before I can actually use it, or spend more money buying my own sealant from a store."
3,Tastes nothing like Spatini,"I purchased this based on other reviews. Like the review title says... it taste nothing like Spatini, but it's an okay spaghetti sauce. If you're strictly Spatini and nothing else will do, then don't try this. However, since they no longer make Spatini and you like spaghetti, depending on your taste you can easily doctor this up with your home-made or jar with good results."
3,A bit dry,I had hoped to find out more about the link between language and the development of societal mores in different places. The book is written in a textbook style that makes reading it hard work.
2,Hollow characters,"Dillon compromised his morals for sex. The excuse didn't ring true that he had to show her the register just because she initiated sex.I also agree with the lack of cleanliness aspects as some other readers have noted. If she was a virgin, shouldn't there have been blood on Dillon's pants? No mention of cleaning up after fingers have been intimate. No means of birth control, which I believe there were some methods in those days. These people hardly bathe. The most they do is wash from a bowl of water."
5,Another can't put down EXCELLENT read !,"I Have never been disappointed with anything Stephanie Laurens, writes. She is one of my favorite authors.I love reading the Cynster novels and their adventures .I cannot wait for the next book !"
5,Perfect,"Similar to the previous poster this bolted right up to my universal diesel 25 in my boat. Excellent replacement for the filter element that came with it considering the filters were impossible to find and cost almost as much as this reusable one. It also fits in well with our future cruising plans, no need to stock spare filters on the boat, just the K&N cleaning kit."
5,A masterly and definitive essay on today's moral crisis!,"Revolution and Counter-Revolution is a profound and brilliantly argued study of the revolutionary process that began with the decadence of Medieval Christendom in the fourteenth century. This process, driven by the disorderly human tendencies, especially pride and sensuality, leads to the gradual establishment of a state of things (I purposely did not say <order> of things) completely opposed to Christian civilization -- that is, secular, wholly egalitarian, libertarian, and anarchic society. The author considers this process <the> Revolution.Not simply ""negative,"" this study also describes and analyzes the aims of the Counter-Revolution and the effective methods for obstructing and finally destroying the revolutionary process. It establishes the grounds for certainty -- not just hope -- in the victory of the Catholic Church, which is the very soul of the Counter-Revolution."
1,Way to much whining,"I am about a 3rd the way through this book and I am so sick of reading about this self centered woman. Everyone has regrets and makes mistakes but get over it. So many times her life is spared only by shear luck and a gardian angel. I doubt I will read on, it is to depressing."
5,CAMPY HORROR AT IT'S BEST!!!,"THE WASP WOMAN, ORIGINALLY RELEASED IN 1959, IS A CLASSIC CAMP HORROR FILM.IT'S PLOT AND ACTING WERE VERY GOOD.THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE JUST LIKE MANY OTHER FILMS OF IT'S TIME, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FLY, WITH VINCENT PRICE.VERY TAME BY TODAY'S STANDARDS, BUT FOR SOME GOOD CLASSIC HORROR ENTERTAINMENT, CHECK THIS ONE OUT!!IT'S VERY GOOD!!"
3,The Leech Woman,"""The Leech Woman"" with Colleen Gray (also Grant Williams and Gloria Talbot) was the film you saw. In it she plays a woman with a wish to grow younger and finds the answer in the necks of young men! She uses a ring with a sharp point to puncture (I think) the spinal cord and drink the fluid. In ""The Wasp Woman"" Susan Cabot finds the answer to youth by injecting wasp enzymes into her blood stream thus making her beautiful by day and not so beautiful by night! ""The Wasp Woman"" was released in 1959.I was too young to see ""The Leech Woman"" in 1959/'60 at the theater but I saw it on tv in the late 60s or early 70s, and I loved it! I saw ""The Wasp Woman,"" in the late '60s, on TV as well."
3,Not the best Bogosian has produced,"Rehashing old themes, characters are not developed enough, and some (Jeff) have structural problems (he appears to be too smart for his age, and knows stuff 19-year-olds don't).You can also tell Bogosian is good at dialog. Those are the best parts.Still, if you like Bogosian's stuff, you'll run thru this book pretty quick. It's not horrible.Hopefully his next one will be better."
4,Ground Breking Work for Personal Transformation,Time Line Therapy is an important contribution to the dynamic end of NLP. The book contains important concepts and patterns for those trained in TLT. It is not an easily practised book for those with no prior knowledge of NLP or the work of Tad James. THe Secret of Creating YOur Future is the easy intro to TLT with definite results. TLT & Basis...is however the definitive work on Time Line Therapy by its creator and will be easily understood by NLP practitoners.
1,"Condemn Them, For They Know Not What They Do","The original was a slice of perfection, this is a pile of steaming dung. Have I been unnecessarily vague? Let me try again: this film was a waste of their talents and my time and money. It should be listed in Webster's as an antonym for the word ""entertainment."" Take a pig's carcass, coat it in chicken droppings, then put it in a dumpster for the entire month of July and it won't stink 1/10th as much as this insult to filmmakers everywhere, past, present and future. P.U.!!!"
1,I didn't make it past 5 minutes...,"I like watching independent films but this was ridiculous. It was like watching a high school proyect. The scrip was cheesey and predictable, the acting was just bad. There was no chemistry whatsoever between the actresess. The camera has no filters or good quality. It looked like it was filmed with a personal video camera at the last minute."
4,"Sad movie, makes you think","This is NOT just another lesbian movie. It is a very powerful movie about a girl having to make a lot of tough decisions. She has to choose between the desires of her mother and her own desires. She has to choose between continuing an old life she had lived before that felt right, or this new life that although is filled with romance and adventure, seems like a sin to her. She has to choose between dealing with the pressure to conform and fit in, or being different but mocked and ridiculed.Although the movie takes place in New Orleans, the story is one that can happen in any city or any society. It had me trying to put myself in the characters shoes, to find that there are no good guys or bad guys, just people whose misunderstanding of each other leads to a lot of heart ache and tragedy.This should be watched with someone you care about, maybe a parent or a child. The musical store greatly adds to the impact of the film"
5,best show ever,This is the best television show ever....the best program ever put on a any sort of medium in the history of media
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"My son was very excited when he opened this last Christmas. I was very disappointed when we tried to use it. First, putting it together was too complicated for my 7 year old. Once it was finally put together we added the juice and he started turning. After about 5 minutes he got tired so I started to turn the crank, and at about 10 minutes it looked something like a slushy. We tried to turn the knob to get it out, which was difficult, and we spilled half of it on the counter. We ended up with about 2 tablespoons of slushy. We tried 2 other times to use it with similar results. Now it sits on the shelf. Save your money on this - buy a blender and add frozen juice!"
1,Buyer Beware,"This toy was HORRIBLE. There are no instructions on how to put it together. It took 2 grown adults to crank the handle, and it NEVER turned into an ICEE. We were, however, able to create enough friction to weld the lid to the ice canister! Unfortunately our 5 year old was very disappointed in a gift she had asked Santa for."
1,I would rather use a nail file to make an Icee!,"This thing is worthless! I tried it the first time, following the directions exactly...and after 20 minutes of cranking away while trying to keep the cheap plastic pieces together, what I got was iced juice. It was nothing like what one can buy at Target. I vowed never to touch the beast again. Because our daughter pleaded, my husband then tried, again following the directions, and (much to my mixed emotions) the same amount of stupendous effort led to two thimble-fuls of murky juice. We're off to Target on Monday to get some REAL Icees, after a visit to the dump to get rid of this beast!"
1,unhappy,my daughter received the icee maker as a gift and i think its awfull my daughter couldn't even use it it was to hard for her to crank the handle plus everything was sticking to the sides we had to use a spoon to get everything out it would not even come out of the spout i recommend this to know one.
1,This product will waste your money and deplete your spirit,"Not to mention a possibly irritated rotator cuff injury from the endless cranking......JUST to end up with, well, cold juice. The other reviews that attested to this were found to be correct. Excuse me while I go ice my shoulder..."
2,Directions Anyone?,"We used the toy once and it worked to my childs satisfaction, but now we moved and lost the directions, can anyone email them to me please, or list them in another review? THANK YOU"
1,Slushee maker,"We bought this toy for my 5 year old for X-mas. She wanted an Icee maker so I assumed a slushee maker would do the same thing. It was not easy to put together. I don't think the directions were very good and it was difficult to crank. My 5 year old could not do it at all and you have to turn it for 4 - 6 minutes. There is no way my 5 year old could do this by herself. The toy says for 6 year olds and up, a 6 year old would have trouble too. It barely made a slushee. It was a little disappointing.That was the first try so we will try it again and maybe it will be easier"
4,I'm amazed it works.,For under $50.00 I was very skeptical if this was going to work or not. It works DAMN well for the price. My only problems were with the sand. There were some larger pebbles that would jam up in the nozzle. A quick twist and they were gone but it was an inconvenience. I ended up sifting the sand with a screen and the reliability was perfect. I was using medium grit... I suspect that fine grit would have been less difficult to blast with. This sand blaster was used to clean the frame of my Jeep Wrangler. I just took a hammer to knock off the heavy stuff and cleaned it up with the blaster. GET GOGGLES... not glasses. I'm still plucking sand from my eyes.
4,Great for small jobs,"Works great small jobs, but I wouldn't try to do anything bigger than a few odds and ends. Very straight forward set up and assembly. I just poured in some play sand directly from the bag and it worked great with no clogs. Definitely need goggles and need to work in area that you don't mind looking like a beach when you're done."
1,Wrong item sent,I was sent a different item than what was pictured. The correct item was not sent but I did get a refund. Still- what a waste of time.
3,Romanticized version of Alhambra's history,"Whoever has had a chance to visit the Alhambra and its surroundings, may complement the experience by reading this narrative of W.Irving. The style is elegant and romantic. Irving is not a historian; he touches on the history of Alhambra as an impressionist painter, historical research and realism are not his concern. There is a series of legends of Moorish lore, which are quite appealing to the young reader."
2,dissapointed in length of survival,bought this just over a year ago.worked fine for 1 year held charge for over 2 hours (normal use)Now 16 months later it doesn't even last 15 minutes.I thought it would at least last a couple of years before it degraded.
4,The La Scala Encyclopedia of Opera,"This is a comprehensive volume, giving descriptions of all western operas, composers and major performers. It is not as detailed as Leslie Orrey's Encyclopedia of Opera, but more friendly for the TV age user (and our shorter attention spans). Each page contains 1-2 photos or prints of people, places and sets along with text. Overall a great volume to have if you are new to opera and want a quick reference for story lines and stars."
2,Unreliable in the Long Run,"I have had two of these units. Both seemed very good at first. With the first one the battery failed after a few years of operation. I found it is not feasible to replace the battery, but at least the software told me what the problem was. The second one has now become nothing more than a very bulky surge protector. When the power fails it just cuts off suddenly. What`s worse, the software gives no indication that anything is wrong. I intend to junk this unit and buy a different, more expensive brand, in hopes of more reliability."
1,Died after several years of light use,"I've had this unit for around 4 years, but only used it very lightly. It's dead now... won't cut over to battery due to ""internal problems"" according to support staff. Battery is still fine, but this isn't a robust unit. I don't want to spend $120 every 2-3 years for a very occasional power outage. Very disappointed that this unit did not last very long."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"This DVD actually contains 3 previous follies videos produced by NFL Films: 21st Century Follies, Talkin' Follies, and NFL's 100 Greatest Follies. I was expecting a completely new set of follies from '97-2000 as the title suggests, but it isn't the case. Still an entertaining collection of football bloopers tho."
5,Drop Dead,I own all three season and can not wait for season four to come out on DVD so I can pass these on to my youngest son who also loves the show...
4,Drop Dead Diva 3rd Season,I love this show. The stories are so unique and I like the character Brooke Elliott plays.It came quickly in the mail.
2,not so happy in fairfax,"I purchased this product from Nutricity. What they sent me do not have the same packaging as what is being shown on Amazon's website. I asked Sharwood's in UK if they have changed the packaging and their response was that they have not changed any packaging for Tandoori Spice. The packaging I got reads "" Sharwood's Tandoori Spice Curry Powder"" where as what is shown on website reads ""Sharwood's Tandoori Spice"" and this what I have been using. So now I am questioning the authenticity of what I got from this company. I am doing investigation on this. But I remain a loyal fan of Sharwod's Tandoor spice. I have alerted Sharwood of this too."
1,love the product...but it's not what came,"Apparently this same product is no longer made. Nutricity sent us something else, and then gaveus a hard time returning it. If anyone knows where to still get this exact product, please let us know."
1,waste of money,I thought this cd was going to have music tracks on it but instead it has a boring interview.The person talking doesn't even talk to anybody in the band.It's like she is reading it from notes.Save your money.
5,Best Tiger Chai I've found...,"My husband and I frequent a local cafe where they make the most fabulous tasting Tiger Chai's. However, they are incredibly tight lipped about their secret powder. I've scoured the internet, purchased everything from Oregon Chai (liquid is decent, but the powder is better), Pacific Chai (better than Oregon), and the ultimate that blows away the competition, David Rio's Tiger Spice Chai. It's what I consider to be just about as good as what the cafe serves - rich, frothy and not too sweet. It's best mixed with milk or milk substitute instead of water. David Rio's Elephant Vanilla Chai is also good for sweet tooths. Enjoy!"
1,Cheaply made.,Had to send this back because it was not made very well and the base cracked when trying to install batteries. The batteries got hot and heated up the whole radio!
2,A little disappointment,"I was looking forward to seeing these shows again but was a little more than somewhat disappointed because it was advertised as CC (Closed Captioned) and is not, at least my copy. You guessed it I am deaf so the captioning is very important to me. I have seen the shows in the first run on PBS so I know story line. It was CC on KCET. I wish I could return it but I opened it up so Amazon most likely would not let me return it.My copy is not pristine, visually. It looks like a copy of a copy.So you are forewarned."
5,Love it,"I received this album as a gift when I was a kid, and I've loved it ever since. I've been a musician my entire life, and this is still great music to my ears. This unique music and singing has stood out in a world of folk music, hippie music, whatever one would call the music of the time.I am so glad to find this in digital, downloadable format... I've kept the vinyl album for 38 years, and now I can take it with me easier. Maybe not everyone loves it, but it's good music."
2,i've seen much better nicu books!,"this book was not as captivating and engrossing as other nicu books by the parents. the stories seemed to gloss over, there are a lot of pages, but there are pictures, etc that dont use as much space for words. the stories of the children were not as detailed, and it didnt tug at my heart the way other books have. instead, i recommend-""living miracles-stories of hope from premature babies"" by kimberly powell and kim wilson, editors. this one is more detailed, gripping, and heartfelt."
4,Hilarious Sword and Sorcery!,"The further adventures of the petite fireball, Lina Inverse and her hysterically demented wanna-be partner Naga the serpent women from the previous video ""Dragon Slave"". In ""Explosion Array"" Lina and Naga are after the bounty for a wizard that stole documents that will uncover the location of a magical artifact of tremendous power. The comic plot was good. Visual detail excellent. (compared to TV slayers). I call the scene of Naga trying to negotiate the narrow ledge in the cavern the funniest and the closing scene a close runner up. I was disappointed that this video contains only one 25 minute episode with a 20 minute ""bonus???"" production portfolio. This portfolio is silent without narration or music. After seeing the 2 episodes in the previous video ""Dragon Slave"" I was expecting more. Thus ""Explosion Array"" lost one star from me."
4,"Too short, but entertaining.","I liked this film, or what there was of it. I was kindof dissapointed to spend that amount for 25 minutes of actual Slayers, which didn't allow for much development,. . . but in the end thats okay because I wouldn't watch it twice a week still(I've owned it for six months) if it wasn't good."
2,Interesting plot concept but zero character development,"Somebody tell ADV Films to get rid of Nahga, please. Don't buy this movie. Get one of Vol 1 - 8. They're superb."
4,end of tape ??,"very good tape and good follow through. The end of tape,however, had a mix of different kinds of bands and music that did not fit with the Genre' of what was on the tape."
4,"Great music, but......","This is a very good album for sure. Note that the description tells you about 2 bonus cuts from the live Montreux concert. Those cuts are absolutely great, but as was the case in another issue by RHINO of their greatest hits, it's important to know if these bonus cuts are edited. The Pick Up The Pieces from that concert was 22 minutes long and the best version I've ever heard. My review of this is based on what I know from the vinyl that I own. Make sure you get full versions or it's not worth it. It doesn't even list these songs except to mention them in the description."
3,Hard to find -- hard to like.,"On the one hand, I'm glad to have the classic Chuck Jones cartoon Inki and the Mynah Bird on DVD. On the other hand, the quality is poor -- a copy of a copy of a copy. You get better quality on the VHS tape , if you can find one. So, five stars for availability, one star for quality, gives a three star average.You can also see three additional great Inki cartoons on the out of print but still available VHS ""I Taw a Putty Tat""."
5,The best book written in english about IRAN.,"This book is the best book for: Understanding the history of IRAN, Understanding the Iranians, Learning about Iranian culture, Learning the will of change in Iran. I strongly recommend this book."
1,Terrible Mis-Representation of the Baha'i Faith,"This book has several mentions of the Baha'i Faith in it, referring to the Faith as ""an offshoot of Islam"", and in one part quoting someone as making the Baha'is out to look like violent animals. I will never read anything by this author again, she may be aware of Iran's history and politics, but is very miseducated in the area of the Baha'i Faith (not Bahaism as she writes it). The Baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes."
4,Clearly explains the Iranian psyche,"I feel this book is an excellent history of Iran and unlike some feel it gives a good representation of more recent history, I am sorry she didn't have room to portray everybody that was important; ten volume books don't usually sell well. She did mention some people I didn't know, but more importantly she finally made me understand clearly where the Shah went wrong and why and made me truly understand the importance of Islam. In spite of 3 1/2 years immersed in Persian culture under the Shah I had failed to fully grasp either of these concepts. I wish I could go back and apologize to the Mullah I once shared a bus seat with who I undoubtedly offended grievously offended by flippantly commenting that I thought of all religions Zen Buddhism appealed to me the most. While I sincerely meant it, I also knew it would be rude when I said it."
4,Fascinating,This book pulls together a lot of information in a readable manner. My impression was that this book was intended to give the reader a better understanding of modern Iran. It does that well. Definitely worth reading.
2,Caution - gets hot!,"I had a similar lamp very similar to this a few years ago. The lamp only hinges in two places, which makes only the height and `head' adjustable. The halogen bulb does give off a nice bright light without the yellow tinge of incandescent, but the `head' of the lamp gets extremely hot. After an hour of use, the `head' is too hot to touch to adjust the angle, and the round piece of glass ""protecting"" the bulb is hot enough to melt objects and burn skin -- even the table where the light is shining gets noticeably warm. The lamp does have a nice style and would work well in a location where it would only be used for short periods of time, but it should not be used where curious little hands can reach it."
5,Excellent,"As structured and clear as the other books from Andrew Green (cf. Jazz Guitar Structures, excellent one too). The examples are all very musical and the ideas extremely interesting. For example multi-use voicings is nice. If you buy it you won't regret it, for sure !"
5,bob hope tribute,"IT IS REALLY GREAT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE OLD MOVIES. THESE MADE A WONDERFUL EVENING OF MOVIES AND FUNFOR US. THANKS FOR MAKING IT HAPPEN. THERE WAS A GOOD PLOT, COMEDY AND ROMANCE."
2,One of the worst video game-animes ever,"Well for starters this move clocks in at just over an hour, making sure that you don't get you're moneys worth. Ok, well your a die hard Tekken fan, so money isn't that big of a deal, so hows the fighting. Uh well, fighting? Well there's quite a bit of fighting, but it's spread out and each fight last no longer than 20 or 30 seconds. It seems every fight is cut shor by something or other, until you get to the last fight which is a real bummer. Also in the movie, a certain Tekken 3 character (I'm trying not to spoil it) is cloned and released, but just makes the movie look all the more cheesier, which is the most crucial thing to step away from when making a video game movie. This movie should not be purchased, if you're a real fan just go to Blockbuster, this is something not even a mother could love."
1,Make the Pain Stop.,"This is the worst anime I have ever seen. Excessively boring character designs, nonexistent ""plot"", scant and boring ""fight scenes"" (which is really bad as it's supposed to be based off a fighting game) and a faulty decision to replace the original soundtrack, which is ADV trying to emulate the Street Fighter movie release in the worst way possible. You get the idea that they funneled the eniote budget for this film into the two CGI sequences that do NOTHING. I felt my IQ drop as I sat through this thing with hopes that it would somehow redeem itself and was ultimately disappointed. Only the word limit prevents me from fully expressing how bad this anime was."
1,"Rent, don't buy!!","When I saw the movie I was very, very dissapointed with the fights the lack of a complete story line and the lack of excitement brought on by the trio of videos games called Tekken. I you really are curious about this I say rent it and you will know what I am talking about for the novice this movie could be good. For the veterans of Anime don't even bother you'll kick yourself in the butt later."
4,Excellent Movie!,"Tekken: The Motion picture was the over-all best movie based on a video game I've ever seen. It had a GREAT soundtrack and the characters were portrayed with personalities the fit in well with the the Tekken game series. There was an involved plot and more than enough action to keep me watching. Not on the level of Armitage III or Ghost in the Shell, but it's certainly a must-see."
5,greatest latin jazz,This CD is the best Latin Jazz I have heard in a long time. It is a compilation of a wide range of multi-talented musicians with varied backgrounds coming together with a beautiful sound. The listener is treated to unique latin music without the predictable mainstream pop. Plus it has a cool dog barking. A must buy for the collector jazz enthusiast as well those newly initiated to Latino Musica.
5,"Great book, covers all ends of the spectrum","From the Preface to the Conclusion, this book is incredible. If you're new to skateboarding, it'll depict the sports roots from its humble beginnings, and if you're a ""skategeezer"", it'll bring back some memories. Great book altogether, it makes you just wanna get up, grab your skate, and head out to the local park. It's intense, the interviews are thorough, and the perspective is a key factor to this book's (*goodness*)"
4,Uniden cordless phone,"I think it will serve our needs nicely, however I have not mastered everything on it as yet. Just haven't taken the time to do so. I already think the reception is better on this one than on the previous phone we had."
2,recording mic,product did not work had to get more cables even then it still did not work for intended use sad only in closed taking up space.
3,Good book for summer class,This book was ok for a summer online math class i took. Some of the explanations were too complicated and I had to use my teachers online lecture notes to understand but overall it was comprehensible.
3,"Be careful, know the EXACT ISBN.","There are two types of electronic suppliments that come with this book. One is MyMathLab and the other is MathXL. The geniuses at Pearson decided to make them completely incompatible. So, if you get one code, it won't work with the other system.Geniuses.The ISBN for MathXL is: 0-13-142924-8The ISBN for MyMathLab is: 0-13-230811-8"
5,Great quality at an excellent price,"We ordered this bed for a re-do of our eight year-old daughter's bedroom. I liked the clean styling and couldn't beat the price anywhere. I received the bed 2 days after ordering it. It was very well packaged - outer box had been torn by UPS but no damage to the bed. Clear instructions, easy to put together - very well designed and sturdy. We ordered a similar bed from LL Bean (with a dark finish) at twice the price and I actually thought the Charleston bed was a better design in terms of stability/durability. The wood is not perfectly white - there are some darker ""grain"" marks on a few pieces. Nothing that bothered me, and by the time we put her duvet and pillows on the bed, very little of the frame was visible."
3,Good Deal,"I paid 23 something and it was a great deal. This was a cheap upgrade for our old computers. They are easy to install, I replaced the old 512 MB of ram in all our machines (now at 2 GB). Now is a good time to buy and upgrade, RAM is dirt cheap and you should consider this upgrade for computers with 512 MB of RAM to 1 GB (MAR/2008). It's an easy upgrade and will help out your small office."
5,&#128077;&#128077;,Love this shows. Great fun my kids loved it.. Great fun. My kids watch it over and over. Love Amy's work.
1,Different than advertised...,This hdmi outlet DID NOT come with the flexible shafts in the rear. One port was also non functional. Piece of junk.
2,don't believe the hype,"Yes it sets up in seconds, but you pay for it on the other end. I've been at it for an hour now and still don't have it folded. Thank God I set it up before I left for my camping trip, would be hard to return it if I couldn't get it in my car."
2,"Forfex Trimmer For Shaving, Shaping, Outlining, Sp#FX759","Purchased this product at a good price. I have owned two of these Forfex Trimmers over the past few years. Product worked well for the first few months, then the trimming wasn't as close/crisp as I expected.I purchased a second one and the same issue. Also the plastic insert breaks fairly easily. If you use it occationally, then it'll work just fine. I used it about three times a week and both trimmers lasted no more than six months."
1,Wrong item,"I'm sure this rug is fantastic. Sadly, we were shipped car floor mats so I couldn't really say. Not appropriate for my sons Christmas present."
3,3D does not work!,"The movie overall is really good, but the 3D is not true 3D. I thought maybe is was just the glasses so I used glasses from when we saw a 3D movie in the theaters, and still did not work."
4,Good stuff,"I was inspired to buy this after seeing PiL in SF recently. There's some great tracks on here I forgot existed. As I recall they opened the show with the ominous 'The Order of Death' from this album when I saw them in '85. If you love and respect the band, it's a keeper."
2,I didn't want this but I got it,"""This Is What You Want...This Is What You Get"" was the weakest link in the shaky chain of PiL's output in the '80s. Vapid and pretentious, the album is not danceable, is not emotionally engaging, it doesn't rock, and basically stands for everything I thought John Lydon was against: overproduced ego-stroking. ""Bad Life"" and ""The Order of Death"" are the only stand-outs, which, in essence, makes the album a decent single. Stick with Second Issue or The Flowers of Romance for good PiL."
3,Clear Party bags,I bought these bags but they were falling apart when I put stuff in them. I contacted the sellers and they looked into it. They were very helpful about it. I think I was just unlucky to get the defective set.
3,Kerri & Dennis could have done better.,"I felt that this cd was ok, but not as great as i expected it to be. It sounded like they were rookie dj's trying to blend different sounds altogether and it sounded off, and real rough. Some of the selections are underground which is great and danceable with beats hitting the soul. I recommend this cd to any true Kerri fan."
5,Great Caster Product,I purchased this castor to attach to a dolley for moving heavy objects in my garage. The product is high quality and my dolley works great.
5,Great product!,Wanted a western theme for my grandson's 13th birthday! It performed just like it should and I am very happy with this pan. Great addition to my collection.
4,Great so far,"Great pump so far. Pushes water out my one jet into my 24' round above ground pool like a fire hose. This 1.5 horse has twice the flow of my old 2hp pump. Pool has been clean and clear all summer, gives great suction for vacuuming pool bottom. Only dislike is the O ring in the lid which fall out when removing. You must replace and make sure it is seated when replacing top or it will leak. Other than that, great item. Hope it last longer than six months like my last two cheaper pumps."
5,"Hayward Pool Pump , SP1593, 1 Horsepower","The pump works great, can't compare to the old pump that came with the pool. It cleans the pool in less than half the time."
5,Truly Magickal!,"I couldn't believe this book when I saw it, loaded with activities to do with my child, and for years to come my family will enjoy this lighthearted and fun filled work. Contains how to make robes, staffs, rings, flying carpets. Recipes such as crunchy bat wings, all types of activities to enjoy and do together (the important thing). For ""kids"" of all ages, opens your heart and mind and lets the magic that resides within you out. I bought this for my 1 yr. olds first birthday but I can't even put it down. Truly a wonderful book, Especially if your raising your child in alternative spiritualities or just want to do the ""funny little things"" that make you MOM."
4,PRICE CAN'T BE BEAT,"GOOD TRAVEL HEADPHONES,THEY HAVE A NICE FEEL AND ARE EASILY FOLDABLE, I HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM AND I OFTEN MUST REMOVE THEMAND STICK THEM IN MY POCKET. SOUND HAS DECENT QUALITY FOR THE PRICE."
2,I hope mine are defective,"I bought a few pairs of these. The design looks like a good idea, but it's hard to figure out how to fold them up without bending or breaking something.I would be willing to forgive that, but the sound quality is terrible. Right away, I noticed that they were not as loud as any other headphones I had used. I had to turn my volume way up. But they are quickly overdriven, so you can't turn it up too much or they will sound like horrible crunching static. The worst part is the plug. When you twist the plug in the jack or even just move your head, there is a burst of static.Like the title says, I hope mine are defective, because if they're all junk like mine were then you should look elsewhere. It's a shame there are no good folding headphones in the $20 price range."
3,Defender marks time,"I've been a long time fan of CJ Cherryh and I love the depth of her characterizations and the emotions she is able to stir with her writing.However, this book fails in those expecatations. This is not to say it is not a good book, because it is. My impression is that this book is a sort of place holder - a necessary piece to setup the prerequisite items for the next book. The resulting characterizations lacked the depth and emotion of most of her previous books; my feeling at the end was that I had just read an interlude chapter to cover the time span between books that had somehow grown into its own book.The majority of the book seems more involved with Bren's internal monologue of doubts and familial issues than it does with the story as a whole.This will be a must read just to keep up with this evolving series, but it is definitely the weakest of the group and does not stand alone at all."
5,great help for the dogs in my life,This book has been a god send and is full of helpfull advice . Very glad I spent the money for it.
3,GOOD TALES FOR CHILDREN,CLEAN GOOD CHRISTIAN MESSAGES ABOUT CHRISTMAS FOR LITTLE CHILDREN ABOUT 4 TO 8 YEARS OLD. I LIKED THE STABLE BOYS CHRISTMAS BEST.
3,Fine. but...,"These casters are fine, a bit smaller than I expected. wish they had some with a brake option... but the disappointing part was how they arrived... 8 casters ordered that showed up in 4 shipments. Obviously, the cost to me was the same, but its all the packaging that was wasted in getting them here. Hopefully, the wheels will roll more smoothly than their distribution."
4,Fusion For Miles is a nice effort.,"This CD is a worthwhile purchase. Jimmy Herring plays some smokin' guitar on ""Black Satin"" - which is a nice rendition but lacks some of the funk of the origional. Mike Stern does a great interpretation of ""So What"", and brings back memories or his great guitar work back in Miles band in the early 80's. ""It's About That Time"" is the one tune on this CD that reminds me most of Miles, and is very nicely done.It's great to hear Dave Liebman who does some nice work, and I haven't heard Alphonso Johnson since his days with Weather Report. I don't mean to belittle Eric Johnson, but Mike Stern's stamp is on ""Jean Pierre"", and the version on this CD doesn't quite cut it. I wish they could have enlisted Pete Cosey (who is ""The Man"") and even have him team up with the funky rhythm guitar of Reggie Lucas."
3,Shipping too expensive,"Unfortunately, I haven't tried this item and probably never will because of the shipping charges. I was checking out when I discovered they are charging almost $8 shipping/handling for this bra. That's more than half the price of the item!"
4,"It's Kiss, what do you expect?","This will be short and sweet...i have been a fan of the 'original' Kiss since 74, lost intrest in 79, renewed intrest with the Unplugged show and then the 'original' line up reunion....love the reunion stuff, wish there was more! as far as all the so so reviews, (sound not loud enough, blank screens' etc...etc..), THIS IS KISS! They put out anything and everything to make a fast buck, and we buy it, don't complain...you know the drill, (especially if you've been around a few years)...the good thing is it was only 20 bucks for 5 disc's! so enjoy what you bought or trade it in...."
1,Patronising drivel,"A very patronising look at Rebecca, a young Maori woman in the 1960's and what she does with her day. Black and white photos, mostly photos with not much text. Not a book you'd use to gain a proper understanding of Maori people and customs in the 60's.Rebecca for example wears a trendy 60's beehive, the people go to dances in the hall, and a white wedding -this book is more like a European look at the 1960's in New Zealand with Maori playing role models for the photos. Worst is the captions with the photos, here are some examples:-Yes, Maoris are happy people-Who cares about fancy clothes, we still have lots of fun-You find Maoris everywhere... in workshops, driving trains, in dairy factories...Oh please!Do yourself a favour and throw this book in the fire"
4,A walk throught the roots of Methodism,"Following in the paths of giants of faith like Cartwright and Asbury was very enlightening and uplifting. If more men (and women) such as these existed today, the world would be a better place. I showed 15 minutes of this tape to my Methodist Mens group and they absolutely loved it. The tape seem to drag on around the description of Martha's Vineyard at the end of the tape but overall the tape was excellent."
5,Uplifting musical greatness,The beautiful and concious lyrics is a great example of Ras Midas's best work! Loved Can't Stop Rastaman Now! Irie!
4,"The Legfighters, in Widescreen","This movie, originally named ""The Invincible Kung Fu Legs,"" was renamed and rereleased by Tai Seng as ""The Leg Fighters."" The Shaolin Cinema release (under review) is in widescreen, while Tai Seng's release--for no good reason--is cropped to 4:3. However, the DVD transfer for the Shaolin Cinema release (from VHS, no doubt) is not as clear as Tai Seng's, plus, (regrettably), the last critical second or two of the film, where the fateful, death-dealing blows are mutually administered to the villian by the hero and heroine, are mercilessly hacked off as well.All-in-all, great leg kung fu, with plenty of action and a storyline about as good as it gets for this genre. See The Leg Fighters for formal reviews of the film content itself. My main purpose is to alert the reader to a cheap, extras-less (not even scene selection!), but refreshing WIDESCREEN alternative to Tai Seng's mindlessly cropped film, The Leg Fighters."
5,Best Show,Loved the whole series. Really going to miss 24. I believe it was the best show to come to TV. Always had me at the edge of my seat. Glad I always watched it by the season. I don't think I could of handled having to wait a whole week to see what happens next. There wasn't a season that ever disappointed us.
3,Ugh!,"I gave this season 3 stars(instead of 2) because they redeemed themselves with a good ending. But overall, this season wasn't really that great. And I'm a huge 24 fan. Bauer wasn't really his normal self throughout the season. President Taylor, after refusing to cover-up a murder that her own daughter was responsible for in Season 7, she has one conversation with that schlep ex-President Logan, and suddenly she's persuaded to cover up the murder of a President of another country, along with several federal agents, and Renee Walker? Yeah whatever, like that's believable. And the whole nuclear bomb thing, like the terrorists would've really turned it over to the authorities. This season wasn't nearly as intense as the others, and it lacked that whole plot-twisting, edge-of-your-seat experience the other seasons had. And when the plot did twist, it just wasn't that dramatic. Something was definitely missing from this season. I think the writers ran out of ideas."
5,wow - and in blu-ray too!,"Hey, I have all the others - no reason to leave out the Great last season. It's about that time again.....to get sad, as i don't have a new season to look forward to.....but there's plenty to relive. Story: I heard of a clerk at a video store warning a customer, saying, ""You have to be careful with that one (24) - it's like a drug."" A friend recently 'discovered' it. He and his mother spent much of their free time watching and watching. They just HAS to see what came next. It tooks weeks and weeks, but they made it from beginning to end - their '24' marathon. So beware - this show is SO good that you you will get 'hooked' on it.....in a very good way."
4,"Could you take a step back, please. You're scaring me.","The Mrs. Hassan gal has GIANT TEETH. Just sayin'. She's a lovely woman, and she plays barely-withheld rage very well. But her teeth are like a box ofChiclets. The closeups were a tad disturbing."
5,So much meaning in so few words.,"The visual metaphors in this bookare skillful and moving,as well as very witty at times.I laughed, I... well I didn't really CRY,but I did get sniffly. ;)An engaging commentary on life.Note: If you don't really look at the pictures,you won't get anything out of it.Some of this work is very subtle."
2,=not= a work of absolute genius,"First, this ""novel"" appears to contain two unrelated stories. ""Flood"" is the shorter of the two. I like a lot of Drooker's work, but as a piece of narrative this just didn't hold me for very long.In both pieces very little action occurs-- most of the longer story involves the protagonist walking from one place to another. Most of ""Flood"" involves the protagonist ignoring an increasing level of water.In addition, character development is almost absent."
3,not bad,"The quality of the product was just fine. I'd never seen Howie Mandel on stage before, only heard him on cd (and seen him on St. Elsewhere.) There's nothing inherently wrong with the video but I think he was still up and coming and hadn't quite perfected his act yet. Although some of the comedy was the same as in his ""Fits Like a Glove"" album, it came across a little ""forced"". The price was satisfactory for the product. If you're a big Howie Mandel fan, it's not a bad item to have in your library."
1,Howie Mandel Let-Down,"I love Howie! I think he's halarious and enjoyable. I ordered this movie hoping to have some great laughs and found myself thinking ""this movie is stupid"" I was very disappointed. I was bored and unhappy with the retarded preformace that was given. If you love Howie, don't get this movie...it really will disappoint you."
4,More may not be better,"I was not disappointed when I fired-up the Panasonic EV2610K. ""Overwhelmed"" is more like it. This hardy machine will do everything an aching body might hope ~ but wash the dog and perhaps I just haven't figured out that setting yet.I'm not disappointed mind you, but I did want a vibrator; that's all, and the EV2610K is far more than that."
3,Bringing back memories,A great film with many suspence incidents. I could feel for the man who was caught in a new world and did his best escape.
5,"If there was ever an under-rated classic, this is it.","I saw this movie at a drive-in theatre with my mom and sister in late summer of 1962. It was the second bill for a feature that I have long forgotten. I was already a big Kirk Douglas fan, having seen him in 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Spartacus, and other big-budget projects. What impacted me most was not only the spartan effects of the effective black and white photogrphy, but how Douglas' charcter, Burns, could have escaped if he had chosen to abandon his horse. The early scenes of the horse getting skittish while trying to cross the highway and an early appearance of Carroll O'Connor driving his 18-wheeler are seemingly inconsequential at first, but set up the dramatic ending, highlighted by Walter Matthau's compassionate refusal to identify the subject of his pursuit. In this day and age of high-salaried actors, directors, and extensive computer-generated special effects, I have yet to see a movie that impacted me more than this one."
5,Great film; not great video transfer,"Lonely Are The Brave is my favorite film, period. I was so pleased to see it getting a DVD release. But, on a 60 inch plasma, played in both a PS3 and an Oppo, the beautiful black and white photography is marred by innumerable pixel dots. And, having seen the original picture many times in theaters on huge screens, they were not there originally. I doubt this will ever be issued in Blu-Ray.Question: does anyone else with a very large screen have this problem?(For some reason, innumerable cheap old black and white films in 4x3 aspect ratio never have this problem. I have only seen it in some widescreen, both Blu Ray and non-Blu Ray. Any explanation would be appreciated.)Charles Judge"
5,Simple glass cutter,Worked just as expected and needed. Thanks for the quick service. Will buy again if I need more glass cutters.
3,don't put food in the restroom,As an end user I find it bizzare and discusting that someone would choose to have a sweet food scented item in the urinal. When I am urinating I do not want to think about gum
5,Awesome!!!,"My 3 year old loves this scooter!!! Even with his enormous size 12 feet he's able to ride this scooter with his friends on the road. This was the perfect birthday present for him. It's built so well, only problem was the plastic hubcaps fell off almost immediately, but who needs them really anyway?"
3,Mostly about Stonehenge,This DVD is literally 40 minutes long. The sound quality is not too good but the New Age background music is pleasant. The most interesting parts were the diagram of what Stonehenge would have looked like originally and the Ley lines the sacred sites are lined up on.
1,"I don't hate the topic, I HATE THE PRICE!!!!!.","IF A DVD IS GOING TO COST THIS MUCH, THE DISC SHOULD MADE OF SOLID GOLD, AND THE SET SHOULD INCLUDE LIVE AMMUNITION !!!!!. YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE, STICK WITH VIETNAM,A TELEVISION HISTORY DVD. TAKE IT FROM ME, IT'S GREAT!!. BUT IF YOUR A RICH IDIOT, STICK WITH THE TEN THOUSAND DAY PRICE, OOPS, I MEAN WAR!!."
4,Nice,There are better but runs very nice had some trouble with the display drivers playing crysis but no biggie.running crysis with 1900x1200 at ultra high everything exept shadders and shadow details on medium and fps are from 20 the lowest to 50 the highest.Q6600Asus Striker Extreme2GB Corsair Dominator pc 8500
3,ok,Movie was pretty good but seller didnt provide a tracking number so i never knew how long it was gon take the movie to get to me.
5,Wonderful movie,"A good movies it make you happy, sad,want to be love by the right person.And everything was alright at end."
1,Shabby Work!,"My fellow Amazon Buyers,I purchased this product for a gift. The good news is that it arrived before the estimated delivery date. The bad news is that the product appeared to have been chewed by a dog with a teething problem or perhaps hungry.I contacted the seller to make amends before giving him a bad review. Seller is NOT customer friendly.BUYER BEWARE!"
3,Not like the play,"I didn't buy this DVD, but I had a chance to see it. To me the play is much better, like of of Tyler Perry's movies."
5,Gives the basics of Elements of Style,"This book is invaluable in giving permission to develop a personal fashion style and developing the notion that true style is timeless; that you can pick and choose from other eras, other societies, and that it is not always about having a lot of money. After all, putting on clothes and accessories, past the point of protection from the elements, is supposed to be a mode of personal expression and it should be fun."
2,"great for beginners, but a waste of time for advanced exercisers","For a beginner, this dvd would provide an excellent work out. If your main goal is to get off the couch and get on your feet, this dvd will keep you motivated and meet your needs.But if you're looking for an intense cardiovascular workout, you won't find it here.The instructor irked me with her chirpy carb and calorie eliminating mantra. Her style of instruction will keep you focused on working off the spaghetti you had last night, rather than taking your fitness to the next level.The movements were shallow and overly simple-- they didn't even get up my heart rate!Although the 10 minute sessions are convenient for any schedule, this dvd is not for everyone. This is a mild work out best suited for beginners."
3,"Good instructor, but too many lags for an ongoing workout","I felt that the instructor was great, however, because it is divided into 10 minutes segments, it is very difficult to put a few segments together. Each segment has a warmup and a cool down, and so it is too choppy if you need a good ongoing workout. My heart rate would go down and I would try to do my own moves to keep it up, but it was distracting having the continual warm-up and cool downs for each segment.This would probably be good for a beginner, or for someone who isn't interested in combining the segments. A few of the segments were way too jumpy for me--hard on the knees.And it was also a bit strange not having any other people in the background. The instructor is all you see in this big room. Pretty room, but she looks a bit lonely."
4,10 minute solution,I am a 51 year old woman that has not exercised in a while. I found that this video was a fantastic way to get back into the groove of exercising without feeling overwhelmed. Thank you!
3,Question...main theme?,"I was mainly after the main title theme, does it have a name and artist, I am getting that it is not on this album?"
3,Fireman Glory seeker,Sorry I did'nt read the Book But I Know that Fireman Stabner used to be Housing cop Stabner. My what a bitter man. Now you work 2 days a week and get paid for a full week. Hey cliff why don't you tell everyone about you shooting out your cars windshield Ha Ha Ha and how you were fired From the Housing Police. This book is about nyc's Police and of course the author has added a few twists to keep the reader interested. With all the rules these guys have to follow do you really think they could tell the FD what to do. The mayor is your guys backbone what are you so mad about. Go shine your plaques
2,Very Disappointing,The only thing more needless than writing or reading this book is taking the time to tell you how disappointing this book is to read.
1,"It&#65533;s not even fun, don&#65533;t waste your time.","What a piece of ..., As a New Yorker for over 15 years, and an active member of the NYPD, I could only guess that Katz wrote this over simplified fantasy while looking out his hotel room window in-between ordering room service.Anyone who has lived in NYC should immediately recognize how ridiculous, inaccurate and off base this book is.ESU is made up of great men and women who are serious about what they do. Katz does not do them justice; he distorts reality and glorifies the wrong things to the point his writing is unreadable; I'll admit I could only get halfway through it before saying enough. It's not even fun, don't waste your time."
3,"Good, but not best","This bag works well for the most part, but there was a zipper on the inside of the roof of the bag that broke within the week of it arriving. Unfortunately, I was not able to fix it. Everything else, however, is still working fine."
4,Good organ trio,"I guess this is more of the Hammond B-3 revival that is going on these days, but Yazel is very talented. I agree that he is more in the introspective vein of a Larry Young or a Joey DeFrancesco than a straight ahead blues player like a John Patton or a Jimmy Smith. He is accompanied by Peter Bernstein who is probably the best guitar sideman in NYC (though Russell Malone is right there with him). Bernstein has done about 5 albums in this trio format as a leader, so he definitely knows what he's doing. Brian Blade is also under-rated, if you want to hear him cut loose listen to any of Joshua Redman's live recordings."
5,I am inspired with new hope,"In this tumultous time of an out of control US president launching a preemptive assault on Iraq, I have been searching for independent and 'inside' accurate information concerning the state of Iraq and its people since the war began. This film is a collection of videos created by 150 camcorders handed out to the Iraqi citizens. All sorts of citizens are free to give their opinion on many different topics and they do. It is fascinating and it made glad and more hopeful my heart. Though I have detested the US gov't for initiating this war, twenty years from now or maybe sooner, I might feel that it did ultimately open up the opportunity for the Iraqi people to use their strength, determination, intelligence and desire and to create their own freedom and their own free country."
2,feels different from official guitar controller,"This is a decent guitar controller, but people who play Guitar Hero 1 and 2 a lot should be prepared for a guitar that feels quite a bit different. The fret buttons are farther apart and the curved sides are backwards compared to the official guitar that comes with the game. If all you ever use is this one guitar, you'll probably be fine (although the distance between the fret buttons does make them a bit harder to use), but if you are used to the old controller or if you plan to switch back and forth between the original guitar and this, you'll run into problems."
1,Piece of junk,"this is by far the WORST guitar controller i have EVER USEDI got guitar hero 3 for christmas but my mom forgot about the controller, so I had to go and spend my own 40 bucks at Best Buy, and in this case it was the WORST buy.The buttons take too much force to push down, the strum bar sticks and is difficult to strum up-and-down on, the buttons are spaced apart too far, and the whole thing is just too small.Until getting this controller, I attempted to play guitar hero 3 on a regular ps2 controller, and it was actually easier to use than this was.The only way this product could be any worse is if it had no strap to wear it with."
1,Broke after a few plays,"Bought the controller from Best Buy. My wife and I would occasionally get shocked from the guitar and it would temporarily stop working, but would work again after unplugging it from the console and replugging it. After maybe 5 sessions of playing the game, we got one final shock and now the thing is completely broken. We were not knocking it around or anything... we take good care of our things. I have owned a Red Octane Dance Dance Revolution pad for 6 years and it still works. The React GH controller is a total piece of crap."
1,Should Have Gone Elsewhere for Dishes,"My husband and I registered for the Thompson Pottery Quadro Set for our wedding. Although MOST of the dishes are nice enough, two plates are broken. Apparently we can't get replacement items, but we can get credit (less the shipping). Next time I'll buy dishes at Target and save myself the headache. The dishes are actually quite nice, but having a complete set would have been a lot nicer."
4,Clean design rugged products,These have held up very well over time. Everyday plates still look great after nearly a year of constant use.Bowls and cups are great size.
4,"Nice dishes, need better packing!","The dishes themselves are just fine, nice quality for the price. They're not quite as white as they appear in the picture -- more toward the light gray side -- but I don't have a problem with that. They're heavy but not ridiculously so, and the bowls are great, nice and deep. Also, the cups are actually usable mugs, rather than silly teacups.But as others have said, the packing is just not adequate for long-distance shipping, and one dinner plate arrived broken. I live alone, so this is not a huge deal for me, but it's annoying just the same. The plates were simply slid into cardboard sleeves with sheets of heavy paper between them, leaving the edges unprotected. This might work well enough for round plates, but these have corners to break off, and that's exactly what happened."
4,Maybe not really stoneware? Shiny and not great in microwave,"Cons: I bought these hoping that they would stay cool in the microwave, as most stoneware does, but any part of these dishes that's touching food heats up so you need potholders. They also have a shiny glaze you don't normally see in stoneware. High shipping costs make the value just okay, not great.Pros: Very beautiful, nice size and shape. The color is just off white as expected. Nicely packaged in all recyclable material."
3,"Very nice, 1 plate broken","I purchased this set as a present for my sister. The dishes are a nice weight and are a solid, classic style. However, when the set arrived, one of the large plates was broken. Luckily, I checked each dish carefully and had purchased it enough before Christmas that there was time to get a new set. Amazon was very helpful with the situation, and gave me the option of returning it or getting a second set at a discounted price. I ended up buying a second set at a discount, as I didn't want to return it and then get a second set also with a broken dish. Luckily, the second set did not have any damage, and I gave 1 + 15/16 sets to my sister. She loves them.Several people have noted the issues with broken dishes when you buy through Amazon, regardless of the brand of dish. I would echo that concern. If you can't deal with the possibility that one might be broken, you might want to buy directly from a store."
3,"Good plates, horrible packaging","This is the first review on Amazon I've ever felt compelled to write. I've purchased 100s of things off of Amazon.The plates themselves are a good purchase. Right size, and they seem of good quality.However Amazon's/Bargain the People's packaging was truly abysmal. I ordered two sets and both arrived in the same oversized box that didn't even include bubble wrap or air packets. Unsurprisingly some dishes were broken. I really can't believe someone thought it was a good idea to ship these dishes like this."
4,freedom in risk-taking,"Barbara Sfraga is no spring chicken. She will not be the next Christina Aguilera. But that has its advantages. Not having to worry about being the next Madonna conveys a certain amount of freedom to do your own thing and let the chips far where they may. This album in an interesting mix of standards ""I Didn't Know What Time It Was"" and originals. The standout track is her cover of Jerry Lee Lewis' ""Great Balls of Fire"" which has got to be the most unusual version of this tune ever recorded. It works. Unfortunately, the straight jazz treatment of Cream's ""Sunshine of Your Love"" is less effective absent Jack Bruce's monster bass riff. Her backing band is quite good."
4,Works,"Item works fine.The clips are not very tight and come off easily if being pulled on (not hard, just in a normal way like when you move a cooler and the line stretches).The black and red protective sleeves come off all the time, they are very loose, you might want to tape them on.Other than that, so far, did fit the different plugs we have (as there seem to be a lot of different ones)."
2,Bland and Unexciting Reading,"This is a book where no tension builds up, nothing really ""happens"", there are no plot twists or turns, and very little action. An ending that could have been grandiose with all sorts of cosmic implications, is instead rather simplistic with no awe inspiring implications."
2,If I could time travel I would have warned myself....,"So, you find yourself almost 400 pages into a book you are writing and you run short of ideas.What do you do?A. add some horrible time travel paradoxical ending orB. have the main character hit by a semi as he crosses the street"
2,Chrono based confusion,This book started with so much potential and then quickly became mired in confusing timelines and characters.The dinosaurs are the most interesting aspect but that is about it. The whole time travel issue becomes so twisted and there are so many jumps both forward and back that it's difficult to keep track of who is who and where. The fact that the author allows his characters to meet themselves as well as intearact provided they do not pass sensitive information and cause a paradox does not help. Not to mention that at least one paradox is allowed but never really explained.There are some interesting theories tossed about as to dino evolution as well as their lives but it is really too little to save this book.
1,Doesn't Walk the Talk,"Let me first say that I'm a dBase programmer and a relative novice to Visual Foxpro. Even still, though I've loaded the software version of this book onto my computer and consulting it many times, I still haven't found a useful tip that justified the $40 I paid for it.I'm getting much better help on-line from the Google search tips for VFP and the sample solutions that Microsoft supplies with the software.Perhaps the problem is the book seems to have been designed for the highly knowledgeable user. My sense is most of the tips come from the authors' custom consulting jobs. Which is fine, but for those who are not VFP experts, it's not very useful.Apparently a good introductory/intermediate book on Foxpro hasn't been written yet. Still looking."
2,you get what you pay for,I ordered this stock and it arrived in a timely matter. It was not a Tippman Stock like the ad leaves you to beleive. It fit the gun ok but it is kind of cheep. It doesnt match the gun. I should of realized it would be this quality for the low price. I will be buying the real one from Tippman.
4,Blondie having more fun,Blondie were always more than the peroxide Debbie Harry used to maintain her blondeness. This album records a real band playing real fun music. Time to get out all the new wave records and pogo round the living room.I just hope the neighbors aren't watching.
4,"Good, Clean Fun!",I was fortunate to see 'This Train' live a few years ago and during the intermission I immediately went out of the hall and bought this CD. Their version of 'I saw the light' rocks and 'Mimes of the Old West' would out Weird Al to shame!The foolishness of all of the empty tracks is annoying - but does not hurt the rest of the album.
1,the enamel is not durable,"its a nice looking seat and its sturdy. but the enamel is NOT durable. it will bubble underneath in just a couple of months. we only used simple soap and water to clean. others have stated they have the same issue. also, according to the manufacturer, this product was discontinued years ago."
5,Caster is well made and operates smoothly,This caster is a great value. It is well made and smooth in operation.
5,A Great Suprise,"I've been renting Spanish language videos to help me learn the language. Most of them have been just okay, but this one was a real surprisse. Great story, great acting, great period."
5,Great movie!,This movie is very interesting. From beginning to end...you have to watch it! It's funny how they go through so much just to get his grandfather's ashes to the beach...
2,birth of another nation,"ive seen several d. w. griffith films, and i have managed an appreciation for silent cinema (granted, those we see today tend to be la creme-de-la-creme). however, i found this stilted and pageant-like telling of the american revolution a bloody bore. the only interesting character is lionel barrymore as the villainous captain butler, and even he is not hammy enough to be fun. likewise, the only exciting sequence is the ride of paul revere. tho purportedly agood deal of the film is lost, it doesnt strike me as if it would be bettered by additional scenes. a big disappointment for me."
5,Best Meditation CD I Own,"I have never written an Amazon review before, however my appreciation for both Sayama's ""Sacred Healing Waters"" and ""Sacred Healing Touch"" have flushed me out in the open. I can't say enough about these 2 collections. I play them when I meditate, I play them for background music, and I play them when I am working away on the computer. Nothing calms me like Sayama's CD's, and I own other calming CDs like Dr. Geoffrey Thompson's brainwave CDs, Nawang Kechog,Richard Warner's Quiet Heart/Spirit Wind, Steve Halpern's Chakra Suite (all great CDs too, but fall just a hair short of Sayama) . Sacred Healing Waters and Sacred Healing Touch are the best of all of the calming CDs I own and I never tire of them. In my opinion this is money well spent and you won't regret it."
5,Great buy!,This handtruck is extremely sturdy. I can't believe we lived without it for so long. I thought that a tool that well made would be really expensive- but it wasn't. Since I'm a member of Amazon Prime I got free shipping and the total price was under $50. It has paid for itself several times over in the amount of time it has saved us unloading merchandise for craft sales.
1,Definitely NOT Mac & Cheese (not even close),"I received this product for free and was quite excited to try it out. I have a child who has a variety of food intolerances and Namaste brand products have been a Godsend to our family. Unfortunately this ""Say Cheez"" product is terrible and my child wouldn't touch it. Normally, this isn't a problem when my child tries new foods, but I couldn't even stomach it! It is NOTHING like mac & cheese. The sauce isn't even creamy?!?! Very disappointing."
1,Don't waste your money,"If all you're interested in is a single source of instructions on how to install and configure some vendor-specific firewalls, buy the book. If you want to learn something about firewalls in general, don't buy the book."
2,Disappointed,I bought this item and was disappointed to see that they didn't work well. The ball ends are made of plastic. I spent hours trying to tight the ball joint and the mounts still wouldn't hold the speaker in the direction you want it to stay.
1,Buyer Beware,"Don't!This is a compilation CD, combining a few studio tracks from ""Michael Dunford's Renaissance"" (CD: The Other Woman) & live tracks from a Renaissance-hybrid (Renaissance - Live At Philadelphia). There is nothing new here. If you must have Renaissance recordings I would get the 2 CDs from which this compilation is made.Its only saving grace is that it avoids the weaker songs of the other CDs."
2,defective stone,"I returned this stone because it had two small puncture holes on one side. It did sharpen a knife well but I did not want to take the chance of it rusting when I cleaned it with water. So, I returned it."
2,Lame sequence to Old Yeller...,I was looking forward to more of the boys and dog adventures and life lessons that made Old Yeller a classic. This one falls short!
2,Rip off DJs,"This Collection boasts having 79 tracks of ultimate techno music, with well known artists like Ian Van Dahl and Darude. But you only get short clips of the songs and they are all blended together with techno filler beats so you can't tell the difference between the songs anyway. I think this collection is a waste of your time. The only way I see this collection as worth it, is if you are throwing a dance party and want non-stop beats."
3,Expected more,no for sure not fabs hottest but beats are decent in the beginning and fall off from there and though i fee fab is a star i just think this one he may have dropped a little too soon f.a.b but still on my bay area top list
5,"Surprisingly fresh treatment of a ""controversial""(?) topic","Flashing on BENJI and the Dalmatians, I was astonished at both content and perspective upon cracking the pages of this genuinely original and inspired piece of work. Have been led onto unexpected paths before re items of art and entertainment, but as one who does not routinely seek out works on this subject, can honestly say the read was entertaining and rich in a humor often found lacking in efforts at illuminating areas of oppression."
1,Totally disatisfied with battery life,"I bought this Gigabeat last September. I haven't used it that much, but from the very beginning, battery life was just annoying: it doesn't last more than 4 to 6 hours, even though Toshiba assures that it lasts 12 hours. This is a terrible investment, because I travel a lot, and I want to listen to music for several hours. I sent it back to Toshiba for fixing, but it is now exactly as it was, so, it's not a problem of my specific device but of this product. I chose Toshiba because I trusted the brand name, but I regret very much not having acquired an IPod instead."
3,its okay,the gigabeat is an okay player it has some problems but nothing too bad. easy to use but could have a beter batery
1,It Just up and Died,"I got this player as an early birthday present from my wife. She ordered it on Nov 1 and I got it the next day using the over night shipping option (great job Amazon). Everything worked well right out the box. The sound was great it synced up with MP11 well. Then out of nowhere, the dog on thing just up and died on me yesterday! It gave me no warning what so ever! I picked it up to load a few new albums on to it that I had just ripped; and the thing wouldn't turn on! My wife and kids got a good laugh out of it and quickly began their come joins us in the orchard chant (sigh). I think I'm going to head over to the local orchard today and see if the snake can persuade me to partake of the poison fruit."
2,Great - when it worked,"I had this player for a year and a half. I loved it when it worked. Easy to use, great sound. I loved that it worked with Windows Media Player. Probably less that 9 months after I had it, the player quit - dead. Since it was still under warranty, I sent the player in. I think Toshiba just sent me a refurbished player that they swapped the serial number on. When I got the player back the serial number sticker wasn't even completely stuck on the player. I had to put a piece of tape on it just so it wouldn't fall off. I reloaded the player and went right on using it. Another 9 months later, same thing happened. Same error message and everything. Only now, the warranty had expired. I called to see how much it would cost to repair. $200 just to send it in with no guarantee that they could/would fix it for that price. I decided I could just go get another player with my money."
4,Drum & Bass & Rock - MAD!,"I do not really listen to music with rock type of feel to it. But this is ace..... Please Sir is the best track on the whole cd. If you like drum & bass then try this out, you may well be suprised : )."
1,Just buy the single,"If there is a song on here you have heard and like, just buy the single from itunes or amazon.com. The end."
4,Lotus Guide Magazine Review,"Telos--Volume 2: Messages for the Enlightenment of a Humanity in TransformationBy Aurelia Louise JonesI for one hold most channelings suspect so I found this information to be quite a surprise. Seldom have I read channeled information that actually left a resonant feeling of truth the way the Telos series has. Even going beyond the origin of the message, the message itself left an indelible imprint on my being that I'm still processing. You might want to view my interview with Steu and Victoria of Mount Shasta Light Publishing on this topic on You Tube.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide Magazine and Author of ""To Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social & Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems"""

EXCELLENT WORK OUT FOR BEGINNERS AND ADVANCED LEVEL.3. PRICE EFFICIENT.YOU WILL FORGET ABOUT THE REST. YOU MUST TRY IT."
3,"An Interesting Start, But Not Nix's Best","I am a total fan of Garth Nix's work and consider it some of my favorites. I didn't have the highest expectations going into this series, as it is geared towards younger readers.This book doesn't strike me to have the traditional Nix charm that I see in the Old Kingdom Trilogy and in Shade's Children.I found the concept of the story intriuging, and it's certainly a very interesting and original setting. The idea with using light to make music and build things I find fascinating. However, this story refused to pull me in, and despite its short length, took me days to read.Perhaps this difference is just that it's geared towards younger readers, but I'm disappointed that it isn't another gem."
4,The Fall,"This book was soooo cool. garth nix really conveys emotions well, and his sense of the fictional world around him was awesome. i recommend it to any sci-fi lover."
2,Boring and predictable,"This book is bad. The sequel is worse. The characters are flat and unreal, the story is boring and cliche, and the prose is terrible. It's typical teen fantasy drivel. Do yourself a favour and read something else."
1,Severely Abridged,"It's cut down way too much. It might do for someone who wants a ""cliffs notes"" version of Mansfield Park, but no real Austen fan will enjoy it."
3,Product is okay...,"These are assorted sizes. I expected them to all be the same...but they come in packs of three, 1 big and 2 small size. They'll work though and my cats will be happy. Glue over the edges...plastic not cleaned off the end where apparently they were ground down...just look them over and make sure all is okay before playtime. Quick shipping. Really can't beat it for $3.17 a piece."
4,great toy but doesn't last long,"Our cats absolutey LOVE this toy. However, they wear out the feather toys quickly.Replacing the feather toys get a bit expensive."
2,Where did this thing come from?,"This towel bar does not seem to fit in with the rest of the set. The styling is not close enough. The single towel-bars have a rubber gasket that holds the bar to the mounts. That feature is really nice since it keeps the bar from rotating and keeps it from clanging. This product does NOT have that. Unless you're very good at installing these, the bars clang around and make the whole thing seem cheap. Think this one's going back to be replaced with anoth single bar."
3,"Picture/description misleading, however...","if you have small satellite speakers with the 1/4-20 female threads on the BOTTOM (Infinity TSS-450, 750, 1100) like I do, these are the mounts for you. They are highly adjustable and easy to install. The picture in this ad is wrong tho. It shows the straight shaft for speakers with the 1/4-20 hole on the BACK, however the units come with the ""L"" shaft meant for either bottom-mounting speakers to the wall or ceiling-mounting speakers with the hole on the BACK. I highly recommened mounting to a wall stud or ceiling joist. If you have no other choice but to mount them in drywall (not recommended), chuck the included plastic anchors and get some heavy duty drywall anchors (ask at your local hardware store for options). Follow the install instruction carefully."
5,Finally,"This is exactly the type of watch I need: no batteries, 24 hour time with date, the right size to read easily and not too large to get in the way."
1,"All Jazz, no Substance","I was hoping for something along the lines of The Pursuit of Wow!! What I got was a jumble of pithy aphorisms, VERY hard to read fonts, and a book that is more work to read than I bargained for. The ideas are in the book I suppose, but a better editor could have made them more coherent."
1,Horrible,"This is the IKEA approach to business behaviour: cheap, nasty, and mass produced. So what if the authors spent more time designing the book instead of writing it - still no excuse to buy. Every year a book like this comes along that tries to be cute but is just annoying, just about every UNstuck solution should be followed by ""well duh"".Example - ""Don't embrace destructive behaviour"", ""Try not to limit creativity"", ""Encourage instead of reprimand"". If you need to be told these things you shouldn't be in business at all.Just an awful book."
4,Enjoyable read,"If nothing else, this was an enjoyable read. I love the concept of the design of it, which forces the reader to take an active role in the book. The format is along the lines of the ""choose your own destiny"" books that I loved to read as a pre-teen. Sure there are many cliches in it, but there are some thought provoking passages as well. Overall, I believe this would be a great choice for anyone looking to get out of a rut in their lives."
4,Flight of the Navigator music score,"This CD is a treat. Songs such as Trapped in My Mind and You're the One That I Want are not on the CD. Most of Alan Silvestri's music score for Flight of the Navigator is on this disc. Flight of the Navigator is a fun 1980's sci-fi-comedy-drama. I first saw it in grade school. In the 1990's, I would watch it on TV and VCR's. FOTN is E.T. meets Close Encounters of the Third Kind meets Back to the Future. A child named David from 1978 is kidnapped by a UFO and dumped in the same spot in 1986! After NASA takes him hostage, the same UFO helps David get back home. The film used everything from scale models to claymation to early CGI environmental mapping. Silvestri's music score is fresh, catchy, and other worldly. Most of the music score was played on one synthesizer! I hope new copies of this music score are churned out one day."
5,Why Some Cats are Rascals Book 1,"""Why Some Cats are Rascals"" by Boszenna Nowiki, is a book packed with adventures. It sparks my imagination to write stories of my own about my own cats! Their names are Piggie, and Rascal! Just like the cat in the book!In part one of the book, Rascal and his gang set out to look for freedom. But they get lost venturing too far from their home!

2,Heads Strip Easily,I used these screws to repair a rocking chair. Even though I pre-drilled holes the heads stripped while using either a power drill or power screwdriver. In the end I had to use a regular old hand screwdriver and be very careful. The experience was very disappointing.
1,More nonsense from overrated TV show,"The second volume of South Park is even worse than the first. At least the Scuzzlebut angle was a bit funny. Come on, of all the possible Kathy Lee Gifford angles, was this the best they could come up with?! The thing with the gay dog was just stupid, not sick, not funny, not imaginative."
4,pretty good,"It definitely locked very securely, did well handling the weight, and rotated smoothly. On the down side, it is somewhat difficult to unlock it. I used it on something that we were pushing up and down the street a few times, I got the softer tires which did show some wear after a fairly short period of time, next time I would order the harder tires."
4,Nice product but material that goes around ears heat up too easily.,"Nice headphones with amazing bass. Powerful sound if used with home audio equipment. Unfortunately cannot be used with smaller less powerful devices such as phone MP3 players. Also, the material covering the ears heat up easily and makes it uncomfortable to wear for long periods."
5,Worth the money.,"These headphones are legendary. I got these because they were recommended by my teacher for sound engineering. There are others a lot more expensive, i did not get to compare them, but I really don't need to, this works great. You can hear everything, this is great for mixing or listening for errors in your music or just listening to music in general. You will hear a lot of detail on these that you won't hear with other headphones or regular speakers. It also slightly cancels the surrounding noise even though they are not noise canceling headphones. They are not extremely bass heavy so if you boost the bass too much it will distort (but that's not what they're designed for anyways). This is an all around great product, it does what it's designed to do."
5,Excellent Sony Headphones,"I like the sound quality over my previous sony mx600. It is well built and the padding is comfy. I use it for gaming such as l4d and source. For music its just as good, very clear and sharp. It has enough bass to make me happy plus I can increase it in my sound options. This is A MUST BUY, trust me dont waste ur money on those 200 dollar earphones.And I received it in 2 days. FAST SHIPPING."
5,Best headphones ever,"I can only see one potential wear point. Where the foam surrounds attach seems a little thin. May wear through over time, but I have had no issues so far. The sound seems perfectly flat throughout the range. These are the best sounding phones I have heard so far. They fold up for travel a little better than I expected. The hinges and parts seem wells designed and are of high quality. I highly recommend."
4,Trouble in Denmark,"I have purchased between 6 and 8 pairs of these headphones over the last 15 years. I do professional audio with them and I am a little hard on them. In the past I have always been happy with their durability, buy the last two have a new issue. The cable covering on both of the last two has split, exposing bare wires. I never had this problem before and it seems that they changed the formula of the housing texture wise. I hope someone from sony will see this and look into the problem. As far as sound quality goes they are great for monitoring sound. I just hope sony fixes this issue before I move on to another brand."
