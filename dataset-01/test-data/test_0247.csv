2,Sandra's in another comedy.,"December 25th, 2009But it's not even half as funny as Miss Congeniality.In fact I don't recommend this movie to anyone really.It's just not that funny.It has its moments where you really feel bad for Sandra's crazy character but all in all, a skipper.I feel bad for anyone who went to see this in the theater. I also feel like I wasted money renting this.I will think more clearly next time.2.5 stars."
2,Disappointing,"Expected a lighthearted romantic comedy, instead, got a cruel film where the simple, awkward main character is crapped on for 90 minutes. If you're determined to see it, wait until it hits cable."
4,check this movie out pretty good and funny,I enjoyed this movie it was funny I like Sandra Bullock she a a very good actress I think you will like this movie silly and funny at the same time good comedy
2,Give it up,"It is time for Sandra Bullock to give up trying to play young women on the dating market. She is 44 years old but in this move acts like a 25. Yes she is very beautiful and a good actress but please try to find a role for a mature woman. This movie was very hard to accept. I am all for comedy but was she trying to make fun of a woman with mental problems? Her role character was simply to hard to accept and the people surrounding her equally hard to buy. The movie had a few comedy parts but mostly it was annoying trying to watch something that was simply silly. Ok, Sandra Bullock is really nice to look at so two stars but really?"
1,this movie s*cked!!!,"this movie is one of the worst movies ever. while watching it, my head started to hurt. save your money and dont buy the dvd, spend it on something better like a dvd of a movie that doesn't suck.this is the first time i have ever posted a review and its because this movie sucked so bad, i just had to warn everyone else."
2,flop,One of Sandras worst films. I did not find this the least bit funny. Don't waste you money purchasing this movie.
4,Amazing,"I was surprised and found myself quietly enthralled by this very memorable and unusual romance. Overlooked fairy-tale story of a crippled girl and the young, worldly lawyer and politician who comes to love her. Interesting plot twists and thought-provoking literary and political subplots add depth to a delicately-written and woven spell of warmth and love. A little too unreal-people like Paul don't exist in the real world-but an entrancing and very satisfying read. Anyone who enjoys romantic fiction with a bent for Barbra Cartland with a much greater touch of reality and depth should enjoy this book."
5,One of the Best Punk Rekids ever made,"Although this album has many low points; it is probably one of the best punk albums that came out of the early 80s English scene. The reason for this album's greatness is simple: it is fast, angry and really, really catchy. Looking from a strictly objective point of view this is all that you would want in a punk record. There are 16 songs so of course some of them are not really all that great, but almost every single one of them is memorable. I haven't listened to this record for a good few months, but I can still recount the chorus of almost every single song on this album.When listening to this record it is most important not to forget that this is a punk record and punk rock is a somewhat limited genre, so it can be said that this band did everything they could with the provided resources.I do not give five star reviews often, however this record surely did deserve the rating that I gave it."
2,Not sure,"I'm pretty sure the bottle didn't have 90 capsules. I ran out before the 30-day mark, so I can't really say if it works."
1,CHEAP & UGLY- ALREADY IN TRASH,"THIS IS THE CHEAPEST, UGLIEST PULL I EVER DID SEE. WHOEVER SAID YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, IS CERTAINLY RIGHT. THIS PULL ISN'T WORTH A DIME. I ALREADY THREW IT AWAY IN THE TRASH, AS ITS NOT EVEN WORTH MY TIME SENDING IT BACK. I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER AMEROCK PRODUCT AGAIN!!!"
3,Not very light,"I bought this stroller thinking it would be a good all around stroller. Unfortunately, it isn't very good at anything. It is heavy for an umbrella stroller, doesn't recline enough for a full size, doesn't steer as well as a Maclaren, and the storage basket is completely inaccessible. It comes with a lot of accessories, but it turns out that I would never bother to use them and they aren't that great. The rain cover seems like it would suffocate the child in the stroller or at least make them inhale VOCs from the plastic. The canopy is fixed, not floating, making it much less useful than it looks. I was disappointed and sold this stroller. To be fair, I've replaced it with two strollers, one full size, and one ultra light."
1,These pumps are a joke!,"Spent hours trying to get this pump to work, followed directions, cannot seem to get a prime,used foot valve, will return!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Poor preformance,"I bought this pump to replace a 1/2 HP pume I have. It was getting old and needed to be replaced. This 1 HP pump delivered less water than my old pump, and was hard to prime. I sent it back and rebuilt my old pump!"
5,Great little sprikler pump.,"This is a great little pump.We use this pump to pull water from Lake Livingston & it powers one large spinkler with no problem. We already have another large non-portable pump driving 9 pop-up spriklers, but it misses the area this pump covers."
4,Lawn Sprinkling Pump Rated as one star!,"I started using this pump in August and it worked very well. In October I tried to use it again and the motor would not run. I called the company and they were not helpful. They said that I could send it back for them to look at but they most likely would not fix it since I had used it for more than a couple of hours. So beware that the Wayne company will not stand behind the pump. They said that my pump had been thermally tripped and would not believe me when I told them that it had never been tripped. Now I know why there are so many Wayne pump products for sell as refurbished. If I send my pump back for repair, they will not repair it for me but will resell it as refurbushed. This is poor customer service. I will never purchase another Wayne product again."
5,Love this ring !!!,"This ring is really an eye catcher as the other person said that reviewed it, it looks real big but it is a perfect size,I would like to buy it in a larger size for someone else hint gemworks !!!"
5,"Vic Firth 17"" pepper mill mahogany","I love this baby. I have the 12"" also. Both are the mahogany and they are show stoppers. Every body that sees them loves hem and they work great One I use for black pepper and the other for red Chinese peppercorns. I wish they held more but then I use a lot. Three are really easy to fill and hold the size control. I highly recommend these."
3,Are all good sheets wrinkly?,"We bought these because people rated these as nice and soft. We loved the sheets until we had to wash them. They are SO winkled after washing! They still feel good, buy I don't like how wrinkled they are after washing."
4,Missing all the parts in the box were replaced.,"The box is kind of old, nothing came with the tank as shown in the picture. And are some scratches on the tank already.There is no light bulb, not filter system, and no air pump.Contacted the vendor customer service, she replaced a new tank with complete aquarium kit to me within a week. It's a good deal and works well for first timer like me."
1,Bad Tank,The smallest tank is 2.5 heated which only a Betta can live in there is not suitable swimming room it will kill your fish.
3,"Not the worst tank ever, but pretty annoying","I bought this same tank from Walmart a while back. There are a few places where there is room for improvement. First of all the pump sort of/barely worked for a long time and then stopped making bubbles but kept the noise. One of my smaller fish found a way into the plastic tube that goes around the air stone, I saw she was missing just by chance and rescued her. The light is too bright for the fish, at least for any length of time. Every time I turned it on it freaked them out so they hid. But I'd say that the BIGGEST problem is that you can barely see the fish because of the way it's shaped. you have to be close or the fish have to be in just the right position. Not dreadful, but I went back to a bowl."
3,Good for emergencies,"I bought this tank on a whim when I decided to rescue a sad, dying red betta from Wal-Mart. It was cheap and it worked for a quick fix. However, it is too small for a betta to live comfortably. This tank is like a studio apartment for a betta - it will work, but it's not ideal. My betta recouped from being neglected by Wal-Mart, I was able to return home from college and place him in a bigger tank (2.5 gallon).Like I said, this tank should be for fry and for emergencies in case a larger tank has an issue. It shouldn't be a main tank for a betta. Keep that in mind when purchasing a tank - the bigger the better. Always."
1,BAD,"I expected this tank to be cheap, but it was horrible. None of the lid parts fit, they were too small and kept falling in tank.Also the light mechanism did not work.I threw the whole tank in the garbage. A total waste of time and money."
3,Be Careful,"Its a cute little tank and easy to care for. There are two major issues you need to be aware of when using this style of tank. First is the use of live plants. They will die when using incandescent light. Second is if you use the tank with Bettas, Betta fish will die with the air blowing through their fins. We found this all out the hard way."
3,Decent Starter Tank,"I bought this tank when i wanted to get a fish for my desk at work.It fits nicely next to my computer monitor.The kit didn't include gravel, but its cheap so that's no problem.The light made the water too warm, and the bulb died after just a few weeks of use.If you're using flake food to feed your fish, the little corner opening is perfect for feeding.If you have pellets however, they immediately sink down and sit in the corner making your water nasty pretty fast.After about 8 months of use, the air pump needed replacing because it started to vibrate and make a lot of noise.If this is your first fish tank, its pretty good."
5,This book teaches many fundamentals.,This book tought me a lot of fundamentals. It has many illustrations
5,Great Performance,"The more I listen to this cd the more impressed I am, especially with the Tchaikovsky selections. The recording quality is lacking, but the playing is superb. I don't like the fast tempo of the Montagues & Capulets, however. I have found this cd sounds much better when I turn the treble all the way up on my sterio. I think this cd is further evidence that Mravinsky was a great conductor. I am not aquainted with other recordings of the Nutcracker music that I could use for comparison, however."
5,A Truly Great Book,"Saying that I enjoyed this book, would not be enough. I loved it! It relates to everyone and everything, and is life at its best and worst. I laughed and I cryed, I smiled and I sobbed. I was hooked and just couldnt put it down. Deff. one of my favorites and one that I will read again. I cant wait for the sequal!"
5,wow!!,"This is a wonderful, heartfelt very touching book. Every horse has a different story and reason as to why it came to Proud Spirit and each is unique. Get a box of Kleenex ready, maybe even 2...."
2,Errors,I own this book... I am starting with chemistry (first chapter) and I found a lot of errors.... Those errors take a lot of my reviewing time.Check the for typos and calculation errors.
3,Handbook for Academic Authors,"This is a good book, just not what I needed. (I was looking more for information on copyright rules.) But for an academic author learning the ropes, it has some solid information."
5,Fifteen videos in all and this is still my favorite Vegie!,"This video is great! The story of the good samartian in its updated fashion is funny and poignant. It is well done and adults and children can appreciate the humor. The second story taking place on the USS Applepies is halalrious. The Gourds Must Be Crazy and I am glad that they are! I own EVERY Veggie Tales video but this one still ranks as my #1. I suggest them all. Although I ahve not been over impressed with the Larry Boy videos, Madame Blueberry or Esther I know many people who rank these as their favorites. Well worth the buy!"
3,gm shock extenders,"The bolt holes could have been spaced a couple more millemeteres apart, I had to pound the bolt through the hole into the frame of the car becouse there was not enough play for it to go smoothly. But overall, I am happy with the product, as they are so hard to find now."
4,"Overall, pretty good","The NKJV is in my opinion, the best of the modern translations (based, like the King James Version, on the Textus Receptus). I particularly liked the paragraph format of the text, as opposed to a verse format, which tends to break the flow of thought. The study notes were excellent in expounding the finer points of Calvinist theology from the Scripture. I did notice a definite bent toward the ""Lorship Salvation"" that is so much in the controversy these days. (Though it seems to me that what is called ""Lordship"" is really ""servantship"", which is to say, they define having Christ as Lord in relationship to the quality of the servant). Personally, I am sure the Christ is always Lord, even when my servanthood leaves something to be desired!"
2,Disappointing,"Overblown prose, predictable and boring. I was very disappointed as I really like the way that Dracula was written. Too bad."
4,Times change,"I would be most uncomfortable wearing the clothes fashionable at the time this was written and find myself also uncomfortable with the writing styles of the time. I keep wanting to say, ""Get on with it, man!"" But I keep reading because they told some really good stories. And because I have the same comment for modern authors.This is a good story; a little far fetched, perhaps. And because it so obviously influenced subsequent books and movies, you will see much of the plot coming a mile or so off. I much preferred the original ending which you can read online.I read the Kindle version and it was formatted OK."
4,Second to Dracula,"None of Stoker's other works can match ""Dracula,"" but this one is pretty darn good. Great atmosphere, and the plot's faults (a little cluttered and repetitive) can be seen as strengthening the presence of the house itself, shut up and cluttered with Egyptian relics as it is. The ending is equivocal, but, I thought, very satisfying -- I won't give anything away but I believe you have to think twice to understand what really happened, more like Henry James than typical Bram Stoker."
3,I don't know about 2000 #,I put these springs on my F150 to get a little more load capacity- Normally I'll buy one yard of dirt or gravel and the truck is a little overloaded- I notice with these springs the truck is more stable but the new coil springs are bottomed out on the axle- I'd have to say they are helpful but not really the answer- I still just carry one yard; my hopes were to get up to a yard and a half.
3,One Order of Tedium,"CNN Political Analyst Jeff Greenfield's concluding thesis is that the public didn't much care who won the last presidential election thus its desire to have some conclusion-virtually any conclusion-before Inaguration Day. Unfortunately, in 300+ pages Greenfield gives the reader no new reason, no fresh insight to feel any differently now. Despite his unique vantage point as an election night analyst in this weirdest of elections, Greenfield has little new or interesting to offer beyond the commonplace the Republicans so hated Clinton that they cared much more deeply about winning the Florida contest than the Democrats who were, at best, much embarrassed by the former president and anything but enamored by Gore's wooden, geeky persona. Although an easy read, One Order of Crow is hardly a compelling one."
1,Pardon me if I don't laugh,"There's nothing funny about a presidential election in which the winner is determined only by massive civil rights infractions and politically motivated Supreme Court justices that make a mockery of their own concepts of states' rights and equal protection, subjects given short shrift by Jeff Greenfield. Although I do congratulate his friends for the artificially positive 5-star reviews, which have about as much credibility as Greenfield himself."
2,"so funny, NOT",Is this a pumped up empty suit who thinks he's the funniest guy who ever wrote a book or what? Drivel passing as insight.
2,Wrongly Labeled,"I was happy with this item . . . until I noticed it was the Teacher's Manual. (Not that I minded of course ;) ) but I think it should have been in the description that it was a T.M., not just expected of the buyer to see that on the small picture of the cover. Other than that, great service."
1,Picture is misleading,"Despite the fact that this item is described as a ""set"", and the picture shows stones on the board, this board comes with no stones. When my board arrived, the top of the board had rubbed against the cardboard box enough to partially wear away the grid on the board, at least to the point where the item is unsuitable as a gift."
3,pretty good,"I thought this board would be bigger. Lots of people said that when they ordered it the pieces were broken or they didn't come with any. So I ordered extra go stones. When it came today there were no broken pieces which was good, but it was smaller than i expected. My regular sized pieces couldn't fit. If anybody bought this it would be a good idea not to buy extra pieces when you buy them."
3,FARM DAYS,"The book itself was great, but the pages in the book were crinkled as if they were wet at one time or another. I ordered this book ""new""."
5,Outstanding Book!,"I'm always thankful when high quality reading is published for teens. My daughter and I both loved Seeds of Time. The writing is excellent, the characters engaging, the plot riviting, and the historical detail, rich. I especially liked how the author was able to seamlessly demonstrate the contrasts between medieval life and modern life through the eyes of her characters. This is not your typical teen-angst fluff. We anxiously await the publication of kc Dyer's next book in the series."
5,Complete book for beginers,Covers all the basics of architecture in a logical manner. Great detail on specifying building materials. My only complaint is the chapter on drafting tools is aged and obsolete.
4,Gripping!,"Absolutely facsinating account of the Oak Island Mystery, I could not put the book down. Every detail is presented clearly and chronologically, every theory is discussed. Well worth a read!"
1,The Worst,How this is supposed to be the pinnacle of contemporary poetry is beyond me. And this is what gets someone a genius grant? This book is weak and not worth the money. Check it out at the library if you are interested.
2,You get what you pay for,"I got PhotoDeluxe 4.0 Home Edition free with my current scanner. I used it for about eight months (using windows XP), and had limited success editing photos and graphics. The menus are not intuitive, and I never was able to print photos using the program. A few days ago I downloaded a trail version of Paint Shop Pro 8. What a difference. I don't feel like an idiot anymore, and I can actually edit my photos without constantly looking to the 'help' menu. Photodeluxe is not completely useless, but I cannot see spending money on it when there are other programs out there that work much better for the same price."
2,tough but poorly written,"I just passed the ACNP exam and used this book as a question bank in addition to the Fitzgerald review course CDs. I would have appreciated more full exams, there are only two 150 question exams, the rest are subject specific. The questions are tough (which is good for mastery) and some are a bit outdated now but my biggest complaint is that the book is poorly written. My husband (a Resident) was helping quiz me and there were several questions that we found the answers to be quite ambiguous or just plain wrong. Additionally the explanation for correct answers is often lacking, not providing rationale for why other answer choices were not correct. Use with caution, this book is good to really drill specific subjects rather than whole tests but watch out for inaccurate answers."
2,Printing is difficult,"This product is fine if you do not want to print your map. I created a territory and added locations via the pushpins. At a lower zoom level, my pushpins overlap and are unreadable. I wanted to print the whole territory at a certain zoom level to allow veiwing of all the pushpins without overlap onto however many pages it takes. This is not possible. It will only print what you see on your screen. If you want to print your whole map, you literally have to save your screen view into a graphic file, scroll to the next area, save it as well and repeat until you have saved your entire territory. Once you have saved the whole map in peices, you can print all your files and tape them together to make one big map. Ridiculous!!"
4,Melodious And Edgy,"Caught these guys in a televised concert last year, and was immediately hooked by their performance of 'Long Time Coming' and the falsetto of lead singer Greg Gilbert. I started searching for something on the band, and with the internet being what it is, found 'Faded Seaside Glory' at Amazon.In addition to 'Long Time', I found the tracks 'Hey Girl' and 'Wanderlust' particularly well arranged and performed. There is actully not a weak cut on the album, and the videos on the second disc are just a bonus.I suppose I would catagorize Delays as a fusion of pop, garage band, Beach Boys and Korgi's, with the ambience of a little seaside glory thrown in. They deserve a wider audience across the pond in the U.S. And, their follow-up release; 'You See Colours' proves it!"
5,"Long Time Coming, indeed","I promised myself 12 years ago that I would never lose touch with the music I loved when I got older. Well, guess what- I did. I chalk it up to being really bored with the endless stream of ""new sound"" bands that sounded just like everything else. While listening to Faded Seaside Glamour, you can pull out the Delays' possible influences- picture a perfect mix of the classic 60's pop tunes of the Hollies with an underlying layer of ethereal sound a la Cocteau Twins. But out of this influence, they've managed to bring out an entirely new and refreshing blend of gorgeously-atmospheric-yet-catchy pop melodies. After one or two listens you will be happily humming along. True to the name of their third single, a band like this has been a long time coming. I hope there will be many accolades and more to come from this very deserving band."
1,Piece of Junk...........,"The reviews have mysteriously disappeared....so I will have to re-post from memory, but the point is, these video's are worthless. Save yourself money....Go on line and there are plenty of sites/forums out there now that tell you how to change strings and there are DYD's on how to play the sitar that are far more extensive, as well as intensive, that are cheaper in price than this. All you have to do is type in ""sitar"" and you pretty much have treasure trove chock full of info."
3,Okay,"Piece Of Time is not their first album it is an ep.This is Labyrinth's first full length album and their worst.The solo's rule because there shredders but everyone knows that if you know Labyrinth.Fabio Lione,formally known as Joe Terry with Labyrinth.This is the best he ever sung because he sings different or other wise I think Fabio Lione sucks and Rhapsody sucks.Rob Tyrant(Roberto Tiranti) is way better,Rob Tyrant rules at singing,he is the singer for labyrinth(every thing after No Limits).Fabio Lione does not fit labyrinth.The songs that are good on this album are,Mortal SinMidnight ResistanceDeam LandPiece Of TimeIn The Shade(In The Shade version with Rob Tyrant singing is so much better,that's on the Timeless Crime ep)Time Has ComeThis album is alright,get all of Labyrinth's stuff with Rob Tyrant.Labyrinth is the only good power metal band along with old Helloween."
3,Something NEW Please!!,"Steven Underhill's models are of a refreshing diversity, but his photographs are not. We remain caught in the same subjects, poses and scenery as if in a never-ending loop. Steven Underhill and the publisher should try something new - a little color can do wonders for a book."
3,"YES, HE IS A VERY GOOD COOK. NO, THIS IS NOT A GREAT BOOK.","This book is one of many I could describe the same way. Great recipes, great cooking, great presentation. Not practical. Yes, I can cook this way, but not in real life. If I want a book for only 6 times a year when I want to spend excessive amounts of time on, I can do it. I can do Charlie Trotter. I just don't want to. Better to look at than use on a regular basis."
3,The Origins of Philippine Music,"Those interested in the musical traditions of Southeast Asia will be enlightened by this recording of the music of the Moslem South of the Philippines. Here one discovers the family ties with Indonesia and Malaysia and the kulintang's obvious shared heritage with the gamalang. Listeners should be forewarned, however, that this music is not as engaging or varied as that of other SE countries and will probably interest the specialist more than the popular audience. Nevertheless, it gives an interesting insight into Philippine musical culture before and separate from subsequent Spanish and American influence."
5,Beautiful to see and read,"This is my first review of any book, and I do not feel qualified to make one, except to say that I agree with L. A. Johnson, but she is a wonderful writer also, and I am only a good reader. This world needs both of us. I am certain there are many of us out here that enjoy the truths this book puts forth, and I only hope readers will not be put off by the _one_ negative review. He surely did not read the same book as I."
5,"haunting, not typical popular music","For several years I Have heard people mention this CD. I was reluctant to buy it. I usually do not like European music. This has universal appeal. The music is soothing and melodic! The first two cuts ""A Woman's Heart"" and ""Caledonia"" stay with you. Also the song""Wall of Tears"" which speak of a relationship that did not work out is fantartic! As the title song suggests the harmony is that that""only a woman's could be"" try it you will not be disapointed!"
3,"Hard Hits, Rocked Down","With what Bon Jovi had gone through emotionally the past few years, in the guise of Richie Sambora's public split with Heather Locklear and tabloid fallout on his relationship with Denise Richards, the feeling seemed to drag it out on their latest single, (You Want To) Make A Memory. The opening single from their latest record Lost Highway, feels somber and shows a hard stripped side from their other big hits like It's My Life which where more upbeat and appealing. This dark track fairs well, but it just doesn't click for new fans, as much as die hard ones. Hopefully, their next single will feel more like home for them.Song: C"
2,Live performance with too much background noise,"The good news about this CD is that it captures a great live performance by the Leningrad Philharmonic of these two Shostakovich classics. Mravinksy was a contemporary of Shostakovich who completely understood these works. Unfortunately, they appeared to have been recorded during the height of Moscow's flu season. The quiter passages, particularly during the 6th Symphony, are frequently peppered with sneezes, coughs, wheezes and other indicia of declining health. I found these background noises completely disconcerting."
3,Not tough enough,"I have several of Leslie's videos. I usually do 3-5 mile workouts everyday. I was excited that she had a new one out to try. This one, even though it says Mega Miles, is not very tough to do. I went through the first 2 miles and barely broke a sweat. It seems like I had to really concentrate on the moves to follow them. I normally would add arm movements, etc. to add to the intensity, but it's hard to do with this video. I like more knee lifts and leg lifts to get my heart rate up. I will give it another chance or 2 but may end up sending this one back."
2,Good luck with Support!!!,"I used to think this software was great...then I updated my OS to Windows XP, and now it crashes constantly. Oh well, I guess that's to be expected. But what I didn't expect was the complete lack of support. Sierra's site doesn't have any mention of Complete Home, or of Home Architect Version 3 or higher. It looks like they abandoned their site five years ago. There are still support files that talk about Windows 3.1, and no mention of W95, W98, NT, ME or XP. So, I can't recommend this product at all. As far as I'm concerned they abandoned me and I'll have to buy another product from a different company... a company that is not named Sierra."
5,Excellent book,"The ""ABC of SEO"" is an alphabetic tour through the often obscure world and language of Search Engine Optimization and Marketing. All the important SEO subjects including competition analysis, keywords, links and page ranking algorithms are well and clearly covered. Although the A-Z format sounds dry the book is easy to read from cover to cover. The author provides many interesting anecdotes and asides and has an engaging writing style.The ""ABC of SEO"" scores highly by pointing out both good and bad practices and is an ideal read for anyone thinking of hiring an outside optimization firm or who wants to put in place a methodology for a team working on websites. It would also be of great use to any web author or blogger wishing to optimize their own site.The book does not assume any knowledge about search engine marketing beyond basic concepts of the Web and HTML. An ideal book for anyone wanting to better promote their website."
2,It was okay,This is a okay book if you are a baby sitter's club fan and you want to learn more about kristy thomas. But I have read Abby's Book and it is much better. This book seems to be missing something. Its worth reading especially if you are just starting to be a fan of these books because you can learn about Kristy. If you have always been a fan it is interesting to hear stories about Kristy. But if you read the books and only thought they were okay don't read this
4,Wonderful period piece,"Don't go into this expecting the Shining, Full Metal Jacket, or even Eyes Wide Shut. Barry Lyndon 'is' however a 'Wonderful period-piece'; stunning cinematography, and superb set design make the film a victorian masterpiece that echoes the era in marvelous fashion. Kubrick delivers again; a must for all serious film enthusiasts!"
5,Barry Lyndon in Blu-ray,"Other than 2001, if there was ever a Kubrick film that demanded a Blu-Ray release, this one is it. Can't come soon enough...."
1,Another Horrible Warner Film Transfer to DVD,This is not an enhanced 16/9 widescreen. This is a horrible letterbox format. No excuse as the film was produced wide-screen. Just another sloppy and thoughtless Warner transfer of film to DVD in the US. Warner has a history of sloppy transfers.
1,Ryan O'Neal Sucks,"I rated this a one star entry hoping to catch someone's eye. This is absolutely Stanley Kubrick's best movie. If you had lived back then (the 1750s), this is what it would have looked like. The battle scenes are great, the music is beyond great, and Ryan O'Neal (the worst actor of his generation) doesn't ruin the film.Remember: ""Money well timed and properly applied can accomplish anything."" Thackery/KubrickJust ask John Kerry."
4,Well worth the try!,"I found this snack very filling. I was expecting it to be more crunchy then it was however, I really enjoyed it. It has a nice blend of flavors that compliment each other without being over powerful. I like that it comes in the single serving size which is great for a morning or afternoon snack and easy to take to work. Well worth trying!"
5,a new dog!,"My dog looks 10 years younger; he is presently 14 years old. I thought his coat had to look lifeless and dull. I thought he had to shed bucketloads of hair every day. He looks astounding---bright, glossy black coat and the shedding has slowed down immensely. I will use this the rest of his life. It saves me from vacuuming the house every day as well. His hot spots are disappearing and he no longer constantly bites at himself"
1,Disappointing,"This is the worst book I've read in a while. The ideas are interesting, and might have made a good shorter story with a better author. The characters are cardboard cut-outs; the minor characters are much more interesting than the major characters. The only reason I finished this one is because it is an extremely short book (120 pages of large type and wide margins). I was finished before I concluded that it wasn't worth reading."
2,Disappointing...,"I did not know the author but was attracted by the beautiful illustrations that fill the book. By quickly browsing it I thought it would be a nice mystery with backgrounds in art, history and Indian culture. Unfortunately very little of my expectations did come true. The characters are plain, the plot (?) is shallow and the mistery is absent. The illustrations are the only interesting elements in the book. Well, to be honest, the _idea_ is good, and maybe a competent writer could have done a better job. BTW, the ghost thing is very poor..."
1,Beware Description is a not what they send,"These are great tags...NOT FOR $10 each though. The product description clearly states ""One item consists of 1 bag with 12 tags and 12 ties..."" I ordered 2 items, for a total of 24 tags, right? Right. Not so fast. The package came with 2 bags of one tag each, for a total of 2 tags. I sent amazon two emails about this. They sent out a new order. Guess what, same result. I will be getting my money refunded, according to the operator. We will see about that. Just don't be fooled. I am searching for another source for tags like this."
4,A Perfect Plan - Almost,"Claudia and Ben are the perfect couple. Successful and happily married they have decided that they don't wish to have children. Things go awry when one of this happy twosome realizes that maybe they do want children after all.What happens to a couple who make a commitment to each other and one has a change of heart makes for an interesting look at the changes we are and aren't willing to make for love. Without getting too sentimental or strident on either side of the question, Giffen presents a funny, poignant and believable look at what makes us choose our paths, and how we rationalize our choices."
4,Does Love Conquer All,"This is the first book that I read by Emily Giffin and I enjoyed her smooth and fun style. The main character of the book is Claudia who when she got married she had agreed with her husband that they wanted no children. Then her husband decided that he wanted children and Claudia was adamant that she did not want to be a mother and there started the downfall of her marriage. The book was basically about relationships and the author portrayed the relationships of Claudia's parents, sisters and friends. It was basically a written soap opera. The author did a great job entwining the different scenarios and was enjoyable to read. The only downfall is the ending was somewhat predictable."
5,Baby Proof,"I loved this book. It really put some things in perspective for me, especially since my husband and I are starting to discuss having children. I would recommend this book!"
5,Oh Baby!,"If you liked Giffin's earlier books, ""Something Borrowed, Something Blue"" you will love her new one. I read it in less than 4 days of getting it special ordered. The characters are funny, and the chapters leave you wanting more and more! You will really connect with the characters feelings about love, life, babies, and the pursuit of happiness."
5,*Loved it!*,"I love Emily Giffin's books. I have read SoBo, SoBlue, and Baby Proof so far, and have started Love the One Your With. Very easy to follow, and I adore how she inserts characters from previous books into the newer ones."
4,A good read to its satisfying (but predictable) end,"This was the first Emily Giffin book that I read, and I enjoyed it so much that I just went out and bought another.Giffin's heroine in Baby Proof, Claudia Parr, is smart, funny, and unapologetic for her desire not to have a baby. And unlike so many characters in chick lit, she actually seems to work--instead of just having a ""job"" that never appears in the novel--and she lives a reasonable lifestyle. The realism that Giffin gives to Claudia makes it easy to identify with this character, which is critical as the reader goes along with Claudia through a bumpy year in her life in which she is forced to reexamine her priorities and life choices. Claudia's struggle to choose will keep you reading to the end, which although a bit predictable, leaves the reader smiling."
5,Best Book I Have Read All Year,I loved this book! I could not put it down & would highly recommend it.
2,Oh Dear . . .,"First of all, I am a HUGE Emily Giffin fan. Something Borrowed and Something Blue are two of my all-time favorite reads. I've made numerous purchases of those two books to give to friends. I couldn't wait to get my hands on Baby Proof. And then, someone let the air out of my balloon. What happened here? It's well-written, the subject matter is one that I'm very close to since my three siblings opted not to have children. But I just couldn't get into the story. In a nutshell, it was boring. I'm sorry Emily."
5,could not put this book down!,"i have so far read the new books by marian keyes, plum sykes, jane green and this one by emily giffin and this is my favorite book of the year so far! i read this over two days and simply could not put this down. you will fall in love with all of the characters in the book and the way the story is written with the break down of the relationship of the main character is so real and believable. it is a great combination of fun and humor and depth and the story about not wanting kids is one that will make you really think. plus the book made me go find and read the story the gift of the magi, which is also fantastic. it made me appreciate the entire book more and the ending especially (it is a big part of the end of the book).i was sad when this book ended and i hope that there will be a sequel!"
3,Not as good as the first two,"Although Baby Proof is very well written, it is not as encompassing as Something Borrowed and Something Blue. The first half of the book is very monotonous (we get it, she doesn't want kids)and the character of Claudia is not as likable as Rachel and Darcy. I also feel it was missing alot of the 80's nostalgia that most Giffen readers in their late-20's/early 30's can relate to and are used to getting in her books. By far the the best part of the book was the Ethan cameo.Overall, it was a good book, but not as good as the first two. I'm looking forward to Giffen's next one and just hope she hasn't run out of storytelling steam,"
2,Baby Proof,I think this is a pretty silly book and would not highly recommend it. I bought the audio version on CD for my car and have listened to it with my daughter. The main character is so shallow that you want to cringe as you listen.
3,Just my thoughts,This is the first book I have read by Emily Griffin. I enjoyed the read but mostly because it filled a 2 day gap between my last read book and the delivery of books I ordered. The beginning of the book was okay but I felt it moved too fast. But it started to slow down and give better detail to the story. I enjoyed Claudia and her roller coaster life. I disagree with a previous review where her choice to have a baby was questioned. She did choose to have a baby for Ben but it was not just to get him back. She realized he was her soulmate and decided people make sacrifices for people they love. She was willing to have a baby to mend their relationship. give it 3 stas because it wasnt the best book I have read bt it was still enjoyable.
3,Not too bad,"If you like Emily Giffin's style, this book goes right along with her others. Internal torture, outside mistakes, and where they all lead is the prominent theme. A little unrealistic for my taste, but overall an okay book. Giffin fans will LOVE it."
2,Highly redundant and boring,"I absolutely loved Emily Giffins first two novels, with Something borrowed being the favourite. But I absolutely disliked this book. I found it to be over analyzed, too much description of the same thing over and over again, unrealistic and predictable. I wish that the author had actually taken more time producing a great like the other two than producing something mediocre for fact that she might have wanted to publish a book right away."
1,I really Hate this story,How can a woman be so selfish and have her cake and eat it too. I hated this story with a passion. Sorry but this is NOT my idea love nor a marriage.
2,"Very disappointing, misleading","Who needs a character who has it all, but through absolute selfishness messes up her life, and then expects others to feel sorry for her? Get a grip...Emily Griffin has ruined her reputation, was capable of so much better."
3,a good teenage fantasy,"i thoroughly enjoyed emily giffin's first two novels and could not wait to get my hands on her third. however, after waiting almost a year for the new release, i was certain that her third novel would be a continuation of the first two and it was not. though it is a quick, simple, and clean read, the story is extremely unrealistic. i like to escape now and again, but i wasn't expecting a fantasy. please! show me where relationships like these happen in real life.if anyone wants to read giffin's work, i would strongly recommend her second novel, SOMETHING BLUE. the characters are far more likeable and the story much closer to reality."
2,Another Mediocre Monster Cable,"I've bought several Monster Cable products for electric guitar and home audio/video systems over the past three or four decades and while all have been free from defects and performed adequately I don't actually use any of them any more. There are simply too many better-sounding cables available, many for less money. Cables make a bigger difference than most people think and I have found that it's worth exploring alternatives. For instrument cable I recommend Lava Cable."
4,Really good,I bought the LP version of Geneva in a record store in la rue des Etuves whose name I ahve forgotten. This was actually a fantastic record by Peter Gordon and his Nwe York acolytes. I was never able to locate any other record by them even if there was supposed to be a good one around. The later solo work by Gordon (especially the CD Brooklyn) was patchy even if great at times.
2,I must have mis-read the seling text.,"I thought that it was a manual, instead it was the book that would be used by an instructor to grade students. I gave my copy to my instructor."
1,baaaad,"i was hoping to get a head band not a tonytail, but it was my fault when ordering, but when I try to use thiss itss likee soooo difficultt to make the tail. I JUST DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL"
4,no milage markers,The Utah atlas is very detailed and through the only thing I wish it had the milage on the highways like the New Mexico and Arizona do.
4,Volume,I think it's a good product the only thing I don't like is that the volume is low and for example when I'm driving or when there's external noise you just can't hear well. For the price is very good.
1,Used and dirty,"Mine was used, no doubt about it. It was scratched and dirty. There was some kind of gunk by the mouthpiece, perhaps makeup, foundation? I don't know, but it is back in the box less then 1 hour after opening it. The product page should be clearly marked - USED.After thinking about it some more I couldn't even call this remanufactured. They would have at least cleaned it."
3,So-So,There is one problem with the headset. The volume only goes so high that it is hard to hear people on the other end. I have to keep my hand on it so it is pushed agaisnt my ear very tight just so I can hear. So in this case it doesn't make it hands free for me.
1,HS850,"I was not happy with my decision to purchase this product,I had people tell me they could here themselves and I sounded like I was in a tin shed."
3,No bang for the Buck,"The sound quality isn't what I expected from a Moto product. The ear piece isn't adjustable, which makes you think the unit is about to fall off at any moment. It has fallen off when I moved too fast. I received a generic made-in-China freebie with my phone and I like the fit better. I've already returned the Moto for replacement, as the speaker went out after a week of use. (Maybe because the stupid thing fell off my ear.) Contrary to what I've read, both headsets drain the phone battery quite a bit.(Razr) So make sure you have a charger with you if you plan on using one regularly. The boom activation is nice, and people do say that sound quality on their end is very good. (Better than the freebie) I would probably hold out to see if Moto will come out with a new model that has an adjustable earpiece."
3,There's better out there,"Liked the look and features of this headset, but in the end, it was just too loose on the ear. All of my other wired headsets were in-ear (Jabra), and having this one on the outside ended up being a deal-breaker. If they had a louder speaker in it, and could figure out a way to better stabilize it on the ear, it would be a winner. As such, I ended up with the Jabra BT250v and am VERY happy with it."
1,"Horrible, DO NOT BUY","This is my 3rd headset from Motorola (my 2nd HS850)it worked for a couple of months. It cost a lot of money and months later, people on the other end can not hear me. I am very disappointed and think the HS850 and the TREO 650 were not meant to work together.Do not buy this product unless you have money to burn."
1,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth,Sucks.... I want even keep this one. First it use a non usb charger and its too big and bulk this needs to put in the trashed and buried on another planet.
2,Works great...but breaks FAST,I used this product for two weeks. The performance was very good however the plastic anchors that hold the ear piece broke quickly under normal use.
1,It just does not get loud enough,"This headset works well in indoor, but its volume just does not get loud enough to be useful while driving in highway. It is also very fragile -- after using this headset for two months, the button on this headset got pushed in, and it won't come out again. This is such a terrible product at such high price. I'm very disappointed!"
1,Not very good at all,"After 2 days of very limited use the ear piece fell apart. I opened the boom to receive a call and it snapped off. I do give it a thumbs up on the reception, though. The headset is too fragile."
2,Motorola HS850,"The headset was easy to connect to my cell phone and fits well on my ear. The problem I have is that the volume just does not get loud enough for me, and really that's what it's all about. Being able to speak clearly and to hear the person on the other end and with this headset (for me) it's just not possible."
2,Buy a 700,This was to be a replacement for a H700. The H700 is much better. It does work but not as well as the H700
2,HS850 Bluetooth Headset,"Since we loved the black HS850 headset, we thought we'd give this one a shot. Surprisingly, it's reception and clarity wasn't nearly as good as the black version, so we returned it immediately."
3,BLUE TOOTH,WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF PROBLEM WITH THE BLUE TOOTH AND I AM NOT SURE HOW TO GET WITH YOU GUYS TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR US. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO EMAIL ME AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU CAN MAYBE EXCHANGE IT FOR A DIFFERENT ONE OR ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS BUT THAT WORKS RIGHT. OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS GREAT I WILL RETURN TO PURCHASE THINGS FROM YOU. LISA
4,easy to use,"I found this product easy to use. Since I'm a grandmother, and not techno savvy, ease of use is the biggest factor in my determination of satisfaction. I would buy this product again.The only criticism I have is that there is a little crackling in the reception, but I have heard that that is just a problem with blue-tooth."
2,Did not like it.,It was inexpensive and that is what I got. I never did get good sound quality in or out of this blue tooth. Everyone always asked if I was on my cell.
1,Product does not work!!,I purchased this headset as a present for my brother and was mortified to learn that it did not work when he recieved it. The battery would not charge at all. In the past I have purchased motorola products and been very happy with them unfortunatly this one does not stand up to there normal standards. I would think twice before purchasing this product.
1,It would have to be better to be awful,"Horrible. I own ten different bluetooth headsets, and this one is so bad that it now has a permanent home in the junk drawer. It can't connect in a timely manner; the sound transmission is tin can and string quality; and it hangs up on callers at a random time that it determines. The connection issue is just inexcusable. It takes a very long time to connect to my phone-upwards of 20 seconds-and by then, the caller has abandonded the call. I have paired it multiple times to no avail. It is useless as a headset. The cheaper H500 has been great however, so more money doesn't necessarily mean a better headset from Motorola. Avoid this one."
2,Hard to hear,"This product has numerous nice features - however, compared to an in-ear headset, it is difficult to hear."
3,Convenient but has flaws,"The HS850 bluetooth headset is very convenient in size and has many nice features that other headsets don't have but it has a few flaws. The maximum volume level is not as high as it should be, especially when operating a vehicle. Outside noise can drown out the person's voice while talking. Also the battery life is pretty low when the headset is used even semi frequently. Voice dial recognition is subpar as well, often requiring repeating the name before it is recognized. But features in the headset, such as one-touch switching between calls, call holding, starting and ending calls, etc., provide much convenience and make the headset worth the money for someone who is constantly on the move and does not want to hold the handset to their ear all the time."
1,Thumbs down,"This blue tooth head set looks very nice, but the sound quality when talking on head set is very poor. I wouldn't purchase another Motorola HS850 again!!!!!"
3,Good Product,"This product is acceptable. Inspite of some noise distortion while talking when the phone is in Jean pocket, but can be avoided if you carry the phone in your hand while talking. Can rate 3/5!!!"
5,Great !.. had problem with item but they fixed it ... that is service!,The item came fast. Then it did not work but they made it right just as fast. I would (will) do business with this seller again!!!
4,No more cords or wires for me!,"Overall, I am very pleased with this headset. Being able to turn it on/off simply by ""unfolding""/""folding"" the microphone is a big plus. The volume controls are easy to use. The unit itself is so light that you almost forget you are wearing it. The range (from the phone) is more than adequate - at least 15 feet. The voice quality is excellent. Cordless, hands-free, and very happy with my Motorola HS850."
2,Not very good,This headset was okay for the first few months - I have had it for approximately 6 months - but now it is just worthless. It worked fine at first and what I liked most about it was that it wouldn't turn on by accident (i.e. you must open it to make it work). Lately it's just not working correctly. This problem has been happening more and more over the last couple of months. I make a call and I can hear the person on the other end but they can't hear me. Ultimately I get fed up and don't bother with it. Hopefully this review will help someone looking for a bluetooth that could last longer than just a couple of months.
3,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset,very good except sometimes there is a lot of noise to the other callers that they can not hear me clearly
3,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset,"Not exactlly what I expected. The earpiece does not fit easily or comfortably on the ear as described. Also, the mouthpiece is only hidden when you are not using the product. The description lead me to beleive that it could be hidden while on your ear as well. I don't think I would have bought this if I had known these things. Overall, it's okay for the price."
4,***,"Service was great. Received product product promptly. The headset volume could be louder. Other than that, it works fine. It was easy connect to my Razr."
2,"Functions well, but not the headset for me","I thought I would really like this unit as the earpiece rests on the outer ear as opposed to most headsets which are ""ear-bud"" styled and get inserted into the ear. Ultimately I found that this unit was not loud enough for me to hear well in the car or with any moderate competing sounds. I gave mine to my wife and she loves it!Pro - I never had any callers complain about my voice quality and the unit paired easily with all 3 of the different BT phones (RIM BB 7130, Treo and MOT E815) I paired it with.As other reviewers have noted it is a good deal bigger than other units available."
2,Very low Volume,"If I use the HS850 in a very quiet location such as an empty room, it is fine and it actually has a very nice sound quality. Unfortunately, the volume cannot be turned up very loud to compensate for any peripheral noise in the area, which makes it virtually useless to me."
4,Good... but boom mike in the way of putting it on the ear,"This is my first and only Bluetooth headset and I'm happy w/ it. My only complaint is you can't put it on your ear w/o opening the boom mike first. If you're about to make a call, it's not a problem. However, if you put it on AFTER receiving a call, you may miss some part of the conversation as the phone switches to the headset before you get the earpiece on."
2,"Nice Product, Poor Quality","I have received two of these from Amazon. Both of them arrived broken and they will not replace it with a working unit.The build quality felt a little plasticky, but volume was loud if it worked.OK product, poor service."
2,Disappointed!,"I am disappointed at the headset that I have owned for 4 months.First, the headset does not work anymore. I paired up the bluetooth again, thinking that it was my phone (Blackberry). It turned out to be my speaker on my headset does not work anymore.Secondly, I bought it because I travel extensively and it had some noise cancellation to it. I did not notice this feature on my end of the line nor could my customers, as they could hear road noises.Thirdly, and a very important feature, I could not increase the volume enough to hear when driving!! I am now looking to replace this unit with one that fits IN the ear, rather than on top. My counterparts with this headset also agree, and are looking for new ones that fit in the ear a bit more.My opinion, and I hope you value it, is that you could save some money, and buy one of the other designs that fit in the ear rather than just on top, which should help hearing your conversation when you travel."
2,Bad signal quality,"This wireless headset doesn't have a good signal quality. I started using it and after several complains from people that I was calling, I decided to switch back to my old cord headset. The headset came with the wrong manual, what made me to spent a long time trying to make work with my cell phone until I find out that a manual of a slightly different model was sent to me. I had to make a search on the Internet to find the right manual and to be able to connect the headset to my cell phone."
2,I returned this headset,"I had to return this headset because of the constant complaints I received from my callers. They all complained of an echo (they could hear themselves talking). I thought this headset was good despite that. However, what's the point in having a headset if no one wants to talk to you. So I am trying the Jabra JBT350V to see if that's better. Someone who reviewed this item addressed the echoing. He said it wasn't much of a problem. We'll see."
2,Not happy,"I have not found this item to be as good as I have read about it.You are supposed to be able to open the boom and it will connect, mine will not. I have to go through the menu on my phone and then it will connect. If I close the boom after the phone call, it disconnects and I must either keep the boom open or if I close it, then reconnect through the phones menu......It consistently drops connection with the phone, even though the phone is in my shirt pocket and the headset is on my ear.. By consistently, I mean approximately 3 to 4 times a week.The earpiece fits way too loose, letting the headset flop around and occasionally fall off my ear...I have had this headset for 10 months and today all the sounds coming through were fuzzy and any caller on the other end said they heard clanking sounds until I switched to my phone without the headset.That was the end for me, I will toss it out and buy something else today...My recomendation is not to buy this particular headset....."
1,Look at Other Options,I bought this headset after many reviews I'd had read about how great it is. The sounds quality is great but it is the most uncomfortable bluetooth headset I've had. It's so bad you find that you have it off more times than you have it on. Which defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset all together. The Motorola H500 or HS820 are much lighter and much more comfortable. Look at these first!
1,Not worth the price at ALL!,"This is my first bluetooth headset, and at first it was fine - setup was simple, the design is nice and it fit comfortably on my ear. However, the battery life is horrible - I don't talk on the phone that much and it needs to be charged after about 2 hours of use. Additionally, the reception is sometimes very bad - MUCH worse than when I use my phone's receiver. I have had my headset for about a month, and it just keeps getting worse - it drops calls all the time so it is impossible to have a conversation with it, and now it only works for a few seconds at a time and then completely shuts off. I played with the settings and the phone's connection setup, but to no avail. I will be calling Motorola for a replacement very soon. I am sorely disappointed with this product."
3,Not bad but not great either,I takes some getting use to and the volume is not great on the ear piece these are the downsides....on the up side the audio is good on the audio boom very few complaints from my customers about reception...the charge time is very good....I would not pay over $30. for this one......hope this helps.....
2,Good value but poor quality,"I do not want to invest too much on a Bluetooth headset since I tend to loose it or put in the washer. The price is good and easy to pair with my Blackberry. My biggest problem is the quality. Too much noise, hissy sound and the person on the other line always complain that there are too much static sound."
3,nothing to rave about,"This headset has pros and cons.Pros:1. easy to setup.2. allows right-ear and left-ear orientation.3. good standby/talk time4. performs well at short range (don't walk away from phone more than 8-10 feet.)cons:1. range below the advertised distance (maybe because I use it with a non-motorola phone but it shouldn't be the case).2. doesn't indicate when it needs recharging. can surprise you in the middle of the call with a sad beep.3. though not heavy, it sure is bulky sizewise.4. doesn't sit well and firm on the ear (am afraid that it might fall off) and doesn't have protruding earpiece, so it doesn't really eliminate background noise."
2,lots of room for improvement,"The voice dial is clearly not optimized. My name is Tom (simple enough right?), and when my wife tries to say my name through the device, it fails to recognize it 4 out of 5 times. All by all the sound quality could be a little better. I've noticed especially when the used in the car, the person on the other line has a hard time hearing you. Don't expect any miracles from this headset."
3,"Not bad, but...","Pluses - turns on by opening, fits easily into pocket when closed and seems well-protected, button combinations work well for volume, answering, redialing, etc.Cons - any outside breeze or background noise wipes out my voice; ""on ear"" vs. ""in ear"" design means I have a hard time hearing, especially at the soft rubber cup gradually gets torn. I found the Plantronics PS510 in-ear much, much better for hearing."
2,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth,"Whenever I am on a call, the person on the other line has a hard time hearing me speak. The volume control does not help adjust this for the boom is too far away from my mouth. The paring between it and my phone took way too long to perform and still is not working right. The first phone I tried using with it, continued to lockup every day after attempting the paring and new software on it did not resolve the matter. The new phone is working better, but did not expect all these diversions that still do not have me working in a satisfactory manner. Cool conception...just not working too well."
2,Bluetooth,"The Motorola HS850 Bluetooth headset doesn't give a quality sound, even when used with a motorola RAZR phone. It is the first item ordered through Amazon that I have ever returned."
4,Rob,This is a great ear piece. It is easy to use and syncs with your phone (or in my case my laptop) when you open it. I had some minor difficulties trying to get it to link with my computer originally but I figured out I simply misread the instructions. My only vice with it is that it has no battery display so you don't know how much juice you have left. Small complaint for the price though.
3,Decent,"Sound quality is ok. It's light, but can get uncomfortable after about an hour or so of wear. After that it can start to rub raw wear the ear hook rests.I use mine with both my phone and computer, and range is excellent on both. I do wish you could turn up both the output volume and mic pickup volume, as both are fairly low, even maxed out. Also, like most bluetooth headsets, background noise is a bigger factor than when using the phone itself."
2,Terrible with Samsung i830,"Terrible, terrible with Sprint's Samsung i830. I could only hear a little bit. I do NOT recommend this Bluetooth with that phone. So I gave it to my cousin and his Verizon's Venus phone works great with it!"
2,Blue fit,"this headset was a fair price the sound would be good but, the fit is so poor that you will constantly have to try to keep it on your ear so that you can hear. also it can only be used on your right ear not adjustable"
1,bluetooth headset,"The main problem I have with this item is that a lot of times when I'm talking on the phone it gets garbled and I can't understand what the other person is saying so I have to turn off the headset and just use the phone itself, which can be a real pain when driving."
2,best bluetooth?,"I researched exstensively and found that the motorola HS850 had been rated the highest by other consumers and people who'd received them for free at trade shows or something. So, I was very excited to get mine and start using it. I was very impressed with the size and look of the headset. I paired it with my phone and started to use it. I was very dissapointed with the feel and the sound quality that came with the headset. I tried everything to adjust the volume and use it on the other ear, to no avail. I also found that with natural movement, it felt like it was going to fall off several times, though it didn't. It was fine if I was sitting in a quiet room, but as soon as I tried to go about business around the house or garage I had a very hard time hearing the other person. Driving was even more difficult. Additionally, the other person heard an echo of themselves. I would not recommend this headset to anyone who is looking for functionality more than looks."
2,"Sexy design, but short on function","The design of this headset is quite nice. But, I found that it was impossible to hear my phone conversations over ambient sound given the over ear design of the HS850 and it's limit on maximum volume. I have found that a headset that goes into the ear (such as the Jabra BT250) make it far easier to hear."
2,Bluetooth Speaks Softly,I returned it because both the microphone and earpiese could hardly transmit or hear at the full volume of 7.
4,should have come with a USB charging cable,"It's a pity that they couldn't have it recharge from a standard mini usb connection, the way the V3 does. This way, you don't need Yet Another Recharger set."
2,too big,it looks cool and it's nice but you have to be an elephant for it to look right on your ear. It's too big. Amazon sucks if you're trying to return something.
1,Won't work with Treo 650,I bought this to use with my TREO 650. It will synch but not operate as a headset. I am taking it back and getting something that is recommended by Palm even though the reviews here are the best for this item.
4,Almost perfect,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset [Bulk Packaged]It would have gotten 5 stars if it would show time left on the charge. I have the feeling it doesn't hold as much time as claimed.
4,Motorola HS850,"I bought this product for my Mom. It was very easy to pair to her phone and has been working wonderfully. It is easy for her to use and when I talk to her on the phone, it sounds very clear. I recommend this product highly."
2,Not loud enough,Has some nice features but isn't loud enough when using in the car or airport with my Razor cell phone turned up all the way. I replaced the HS850 with a Jabra and it's much better
1,Motorola HS805-Can't Stay On My Ear,"The Motorola HS805 does not work for me. It simply cannot stay on my ear. I tried numerous times to hook it on; sometimes it hooks on but ultimately falls off when I press the button or turn my head. Even when it hooks on, it feels unsteady. Too bad, because the call clarity was quite good and was easy to use. I finally gave up on it and purchased a Bluetooth speakerphone for my car, which works great. See my review on Motorola T305.Bottom Line: I would not recommend it."

2,Not very durable.,"It's a switch, not a router. It does exactly what a switch is supposed to do. If you don't know what a switch does, you probably don't want this. The reason I bought this (and a D-Link DGS-1008G) was to replace another DES-1105 and DGS-1008G that both failed due to a power surge. Not too surprising since the surge also knocked out quite a few other devices. Unfortunately these BOTH failed about three weeks later during another storm, but this time nothing else was affected. (They were both plugged into UPS/surge protectors both times.) So yes they're cheap and almost disposable, but this time I think I'll spend a bit more for something a little more reliable."
5,Making sense of corporate growth,"It's not necessarily that as a company grows from the garage into the boardroom that bad things happen . . . it's that some things are inevitable and are a function of growth.This book sumarizes the multiple facets involved in such growth and allows the reader to compare the growth cycle of companies at varying stages. It's impact on people, org behavior, culture, awareness and other areas that the ""garage shop"" does not need to consider at early stages. It's a key read and assessment as companies find themselves in transition from a heavily entrepreneurial spirit to a more entrenched corporate being and notes many of the patterns such growth requires. Read between the lines and you may find companies who are currently faltering because of a lack of transition mindset to allow them to sustain managed growth or the new ""size."" Overall, it's a great academic read."
3,Split Personalities,This was a good textbook. The concepts in the book can be seen in any workplace in America. The explanation and examples of the different type of leadership styles really help me recognize those leadership traits in both my employers and co-worker. If we are knowledgeable about the different type personalities that people have we will be able to understand why they make the decisions that they make. Having this knowledge improves both communication and dialogue in the workplace.
2,Looks good but not heavy duty,"Looks good, but not great leather for the price. It's already torn at the edges. Not greatly pleased, would not have purchased if I had seen in person."
4,.,Video teaches some body awareness and gentle activity. Good for kids who are over-stimulated and need to relax and connect their brain and body again. Our 6 year old likes it a lot and he seems more calm and focused after doing the workout.
5,A quality collection...,"Unfortunately the previous review does not give just credit to the hikes included in this book and the specific reason for including them. As a native of Colorado, I can say that there are copious amounts of trails and wanderings to be enjoyed and Weinstein and Johnson's guide does an excellent job of providing a handful of quality Colorado options for the day-hiker or multi-day trekker. It is truly one of the few guides that covers loop routes of Colorado in vivid description and I would highly recommend it."
3,How T o Prepare,Good teaching tool-little hard to understand some of the stuff because the book was written so long ago.
2,POD (Print on Demand) Book,This book is a mass market rip off not only does it have over one hundred extra pages because of the large font but there is no table of contents its just awful.
1,Long stories with a bit too much violence,"I'm not sure why people gave such glowing reviews for this book, the stories themselves are long and bland, with little bits of violence here and there (people tearing into pieces?) I am definitely NOT going to recommend this for ANY children."
2,SensGard by ZEM,Lack of adjusting features makes the unit uncomfortable to wear. Hence people do not like them and do not wear them.
2,Un-comfortable,"I already had the older version and thought that these would be better because of the higher Db rating. It seems that for some reason ZEM redesigned the head-band as well and the new head-band is shorter than the old one. It might work OK for someone with a small head or a woman or a child but for an adult male it is just too short to go over my head without being too tight. Kind of boggled my mind why they would even change the head-band, the older version works well and I still use it."
5,"Amazing, well written and sooooo helpful","Thoroughly enjoy these cards as part of my daily routine. They enable me to tap into another area I was unfamilar with, numerology, this is based from Linda's teachings from the Chaldean Alphabet. I'm a great fan of Linda Goodman and have read all her books, they are a constant source for advice and are regularly shared with my friends too. I think Crystal Bush has done a great job in capturing Linda's teachings and creating a beautiful card deck to read from, Crystal should be applauded for her resolve and tenacity in keeping Linda's teachings alive and present. From what I understand Crystal was a very good friend and support system to Linda Goodman before she died and Linda chose Crystal to continue in her name after she passed, if Linda trusted her, so should we! You won't regret this buy!"
3,Disappointing on several levels,"I am puzzled as to why this book is recommended for children ages 4-8. There is minimal text, and what text there is does little to advance the story line. The illustrations are eye catching from a distance, but up close are actually rather frightening--the people's faces are amorphous and blobby. My two children (ages 5 and nearly 4) love going to the fair, but they don't love this book."
5,Texbook of KW,This guy has some good ideas about evolving a company's KW technology. Useful as a textbook.
3,"Okay, but the Original is better.","I had an original Sensa pen, but my wife liked it so much that she has borrowed it permanently. Consequently, I wanted to get another. I saw one of the Cloud 9 pens and thought they were going to be good as the original, but just cheaper. Well, the lower price means a lot. The Cloud 9 pens barrels are made out of a plastic with metal flake. They look good, but the pen is just too light to handle easily. The grip is still good, but I don't prefer the pen's balance. So if you like Bic plastic pens then this might work for you, but if you like heavier pens then get the Sensa pens that have metal barrels."
3,Palmgren Thickness Planer,"It is performing like a budget purchase. Only complaint is selected thickness adjustment rises during run of hardwoods. As result I have resorted to very minimal cuts and additional time to exact tolerances requested. I would like to purchase hand held ""hone"" and additional blades for this unit; is this something Amazon merchandises or direct with Palmgren?"
2,"Too much, too quick, too sloppy","As a bigtime Babylon 5 fan, I was eagerly awaiting this book. Guess I shouldn't be surprised that it feel victim to Sturgeon's law, that 90% of all media SF is crud.The major problem with the book is that it hops through time, with no consideration towards the readers. It would be nice to be told the date, instead of just having a character suddenly get really old.Major events are skipped over, characters switch names so as to make it impossible to keep track of them. There's little description, so keeping minor characters set is next to impossible. Major characters are just hard to keep track of. I mean, who the hell can keep track when you've got Blodo and Larry and Ms. Alexander and Monkey and Mick Foley and Dude Love alll over the place.Put basically, it staggers like an epilectic who just suffered a severe electric shock. I look forward to B5 books that maintain the great storytelling quality that the show is renowned for. I just won't hold my breath."
5,Excellent book,Matlab based programs would have been more beneficial because many of them use matlab only.
1,Use the term 'book' very loosely...,I was very disappointed when I received my copy of this cook'book'. This is a very poorly photocopied set of recipes on regular copy paper... and someone needs to check the toner. I ordered this book since I have become a part of a Pakistani circle of friends and family and wanted to be able to cook some of the same wonderful things they do. They reviewed the book and were questioning the recipes. I know that I'll be sticking to observation and lessons from my friends.
4,Well they gave us Planet of the Apes....,"Looks like Silva was reading the reviews of the MUCH, MUCH superior set (referenced below) they released in 2005, in which a few reviewers noted the absence of Goldsmith's score to Planet of the Apes, well one year later and we get it on this truncated compilation. A shame it was not recorded in time for the much superior 4 disc box. This is a nice intro to the late maestro, but skip this and spring for the four disc set they released in 2005, which has pretty much everything they recorded in Prague up to that point, except for a few Star Trek and Rambo cues, and some other cues they recorded before they owend rights to the Philharmonia recordings.Jerry Goldsmith: 40 Years of Film MusicAgain, this is a nice intro for Goldsmith and if you want it as your freebie in part of amazon's 4-for-3 deal, that would be okay, but if you want to be exposed to the best of the maestro--Go for the one linked above."
5,best book ever,"mary higgins clark outdid herslef again like always.this book will have you on the edge of your seat. you will not want to put it down once you start, there are no boring part in it you will be literally flying off each page. i promise you , you will not be sorry at all. if your a type of person who loves mystery and crime and lifetime movives you are going to love this. it has so much suspense it make your stomach turn. while i was reading it i couldnt consentrate on any thing but the words in front of my face. I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!! pick it please, after i read one i keep going back ."
3,A child Witness Murder.,"A Stranger Is Watching?In the novel A Stranger is watching, by Mary Higgins Clark, a drama novel; was about a murder that took place two years ago, in which a six year old child witnessed the murder. The novel opens as Steve and Shawn debate capital punishment. A young man named Ronald Thompson has been sentenced to death for Nina's murder. Throughout the novel they give clues on who could be the killer. At the end of the novel the last person you would think was accused of the murder. The main character was Ronald. I personally liked the novel because I like suspense novels and movies. I would recommend this book to anyone because it is so dramatic and detailed. Also it's full of thrill.Jessica Acosta"
3,Not so impressive,"Compared with the other MHC novels I have read earlier, I don't find this as impressive. Knowing the killer & trying to find the connection with the other characters was just what kept me reading on.For a time passer, it's a good read nonetheless."
5,Just what I needed!,"When we built our house 15 years ago, we purchased these same handles for our kitchen cabinets/drawers. We just did a remodel of our kitchen island and needed more; needless to dsay, they are no longer in the stores. But, this vendor had just what we needed and the amount we needed, too...they arived as pictures and in a timely manner...it's a perfect match!"
4,Gorgeous Cinematography,"Too many people are going to be drawn to this film because they think it is supposed to be overly ""sexy."" The most beautiful parts of the movie will be lost on those people. The lighting and cinematography are first rate (as you would expect) and the secondary characters are beautiful in their own human way. The two prostitutes, while representing the beginning and ending of the ""career"" are still sweet, caring women. Nicole Kidman gives an Oscar-worthy performance."
3,Very nice picture,I was amazed by the beutiful colors and lightning in this dvd. It is ashame it is only in 4:3 full screen format. Good thriller with a lot of beautiful girls in it. I found the ending a little sudden and strange.
1,LH,"I absolutely refuse to buy the ""Americanized"" (i.e. wimped out, censored, typical idiocy) version of this movie. If they were going to release this, they should have released the real thing. So, 5 stars for the movie, 1 star for the spineless minions that didn't have the balls to put the uncensored version of the movie on DVD."
3,"""CITED OEDIPUS""","PLOT: We follow Tom Cruise through what is potentially a Walpurgisnacht - not quite a ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" [This may be a wonderous future vehicle for Cruise and Kidman] His journey is fascinating - like Everyman he meets various temptations on his way through Kubrick's never-ending vision of New York after dark. Contemporary Washington could be a better choice."
2,A disappointing mess,"As a fan of Stanley Kubrick, I had been eagerly anticipating this film. I can now say how disappointed I am. While Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, and the rest of this cast are all solid, the story, and especially the way it is delivered both takes forever to develop and frustrates.The dialogue takes forever for the actors to say, and I often felt like if I made hand gestures, it might help to speed up the story out of their mouths.Certain aspects of the story, characters, and entire scenes serve no purpose at all in this film, other than to elongate it.However, as for the now-famous orgy scene, it is certainly one of the most fascinating and bizarre sequences in recent film.I can't help but feel sorry for the cast and crew, who, while they put forth such a strong effort, end up in such a mess."
1,Terrible,"What a waste of time. They must have offered Tom And Nicole a lot of money to start in this garbage. I continued watching the movie hoping in would get better. boy, was I wrong. Althought i will admit it has a couple of very sensous scenes, but still not worth wasting your time and money."
3,Works Pretty Well as a Dream,"EYES WIDE SHUT (1999) * * 1/2 Kubrick, Kidman and Cruise spent the better part of a year making a movie with a moral as simple as ""appreciate what you have at home (in this case a wife and kid) and don't venture out into unknown territory because there's a lot of evil and misery out there"". Even with director Kubrick's notorious propensity for retake after retake, he obviously gave up on getting a convincing performance out of Cruise as a physician. He's as believable as Woody Allen playing a gladiator. Still, Kidman is good and Stanley Pollack is excellent in a supporting role, and if you take the movie as sort of like a dream it works pretty well."
4,Shame about US censorship,Rather a pity that the US reviewers think the American public such children: the R1 disc seems to contain a number of mysterious men in long dark cloaks standing around during the orgy scenes. These peculiar intruders are absent from the European edition. Die-hard Kubrick fans and dribbling pervs who own multi region machines may wish to purchase the R2 disc. Note that the film is not widescreen anamorphic. Bit of a shame but Stan knows best
1,Not impressed,"I purchased this DVD for my husband. I have not watched it, nor do I have any interest in it."
1,AHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"[...], I would. My friend forced me to watch this movie and I can understand why he likes it: it's nothing but naked women, naked women, and more naked women. Nicole Kidman was so melodramatic, Tom Cruise wasn't much better - the characters had no redeeming qualities...I really didn't care about what happened to any of them. And I never did figure out the point of the movie. This movie is basically a cleaned up porno, but I daresay that even a porn would have a more interesting plotline..."
2,Only good thing about the movie is ....,"Nicole Kidman nude. She has a very firm and toned butt, a flat stomach, and a beautiful body. There are some other sexy nude women in the movie too. That's the only reason it deserves two stars -- for the erotic element.But there are too many negative things about the movie: no plot, no reasonable ending for the suspense generated, scenes hanging loose without explanation...you get the idea. The entire movie is surrrealistic. Be warned: if you watch the movie expecting a sexy thriller, you WILL be disappointed. It's way too long (2Hrs:39Mins) to waste.I can compare it to ""Random hearts"" as one of the worst mainstream movies ever made."
4,Couldn't you spot his wife at the orgy???,"I kept looking for her. Of course all the guests were wearing masks... but... somehow I thought that was the whole point of the film. That the Tom Cruise character (as the surrogate for all of us) has lived with certain notions of *how things are*. This film is about the unraveling of those notions. Yes, Doctor, your rich friends have secret parties that you can not imagine. Oh and yes, your wife has been involved all along."
2,What was Stan smoking?,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" makes no sense whatsoever. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it somehow managed to make more sense than ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""From beginning to end this film just meandered around. It seemed like the actors were just being placed into scenes, rather than being compelled or driven by a story or cause.I don't know where else to go with this review. Not that I am enthralled by either, but Tom and Kim were wasted on this story. Not Kubrick's greatest. See ""2001"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", or ""A Clockwork Orange"" if you want a good Kubric movie.If curiosity has the best of you, fight it, or do no more than rent it to see the madness for yourself."
3,The debates will never end.,"I can say that, as far as reviews go, this is one of the most debated films ever. I'm gonna say it right now, both sides are right.One one hand, this film is important, and it can be studied. It is a psychological film, that not everyone will understand, probably because it's very hard to understand. The film has some haunting images, and it's by Stanley Kubrick...But this is not one of his better films. Even if Film Scolars look deep into this work, and understand it, the message is simple. The plot is simple, and even though it may seem deep, it's shallow on the surface. The film is slow in order to let the plot sit in, which most people won't like, although it worked for 2001.I know my review may be confusing, but I'm so confused about this movie that I don't know what to think. I can say this, if you haven't seen it, give it a rent first, because this is a movie not everyone will like."
5,"An intense, mysterious, thought-provoking cinematic journey","""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a colorful, deeply-layered psychological study of infidelity in married couples. The late, great Stanley Kubrick captures with rich cinematic nuances the drama and sexual tension between men and women. This haunting, dream-like odyssey is punctuated by Jocelyn Pook's moody music score. This was the best film of 1999. But it is not your standard Cruise/Kidman fare. No matter what, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" will never be quite what you expect it to be. Kubrick fans are likely to appreciate it more than Cruise/Kidman fans. But try it anyway. This film is best enjoyed when a viewer brings an open mind to it. View it at least twice. In every sense, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an R-rated film for mature adults."
2,Weird,"I felt like this was a movie I ""should"" watch so I could be in-the-know with everyone who talks about it. Because I was about 10 years old when it came out, I obviously wasn't allowed to watch it at the time. Anyway, I thought it was really boring and weird. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. I didn't mind the sex/nudity, just the plot was really strange. I don't know, I can't describe it. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. :/"
1,Unreadable disc. Most DVD players dont read it,The HD DVD movies they sell are not accepted by any DVD players. It is supposed to be a new format that you cannot get any information about
1,Skip it!,"One word sums this movie. STUPID. For all those who liked this movie and said that it was ""thought provoking, brilliant, fascinating, etc."". You all need to go to therapy or be a guest star on Roger Ebert & Friends. The only thing that kept my attention to this complete waste of time was the $4.32 that I gave to Blockbuster."
3,"OK movie, but Kubrick's BEST? Not even!","Did I watch a different movie than everybody else? Yes, Tom Cruise was great in it and I'd say so was Nicole Kidman. But the story doesn't hold a candle to some of his other masterpieces (Dr.Strangelove or 2001). Some person said there were a lot of climactic scenes, but that person probably read Ebert's review that each scene had an arc of its own. Seen at its whole, it's an interesting movie about how easy it is to get into adultery or sexual perversion, while celebrating marriage! Weird. Good movie, but would I watch it again? No. Now, if you want to watch a movie for its brilliance over and over again, watch Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove."
2,Hard to keep eyes open on this film,"I am a great fan of Kubrick's. In fact, there are few films of his that I don't think of as inspired genius. But this film was a great bore! I had heard that this film was overrated but decided to see it after Scorsese rated it as one his top ten of the decade. But I must be missing something, I see no value in this picture whatsoever (either acting, plot, cinematography or music). There was no there there, just so many short vignettes of sexual desire that only reflect the sadness and selfishness of the characters. I think that the emperor has no clothes on this occasion and can't agree that it is great because it was the last film of a great director."
1,Miserable... Boring... Overated.,"I want you to know that I admire Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidmans work together. Films such as 'Days of thunder' and 'Far and away', were top notch performances by the two actors. 'Eyes wide shut', was just utter trash. Dont be deceived by the rumours floating around that this is a number 1 hit. The whole movie was a mess and its hard to keep your EYES WIDE OPEN during this movie."
2,Rent Before You Buy,"The movie begins earnestly enough, with the story of a marriage in serious trouble. Doctor Tom Cruise flirts shamelessly with two young models while wife Nicole Kidman exchanges innuendo with a suave older gentleman at a swanky dinner party. What follows over the next two plus hours is a movie which takes a surreal look at the decay of a relationship and the drives of the man and woman involved.While not without it's entertaining moments, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a meandering film which loses it's audience as quickly as it intrigues it.Ultimately, the movie's slow pacing lingers far too long on an extended subplot involving a bizarre, ritualistic sex cult.Unfortunately, director Stanley Kubrick passed away prior to the completion of this film. What remained of his final vision for this movie is debatable, but for the casual viewer, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" will likely prove to be a confusing piece with marginal entertainment value."
1,Horrendously horrible movie!,I'm sad this was Kubrick's last movie. He was one of the greatest directors of all time. It's sad that his last movie was worse than both Ishtar and Battlefield Earth! I would give it negative five stars if I could! The piano keys alone repeating over and over again make this stinker one of the worst movie experiences any human has ever had! No wonder Tom and Nicole got divorced after appearing in this travesty!
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"With all the publicity this film received it was a must see for me, but wait a minute, what is this my simple taste just can not see the grandeur. This is not a case of misunderstanding on my part (man, women, birth, life, death, infinity) but rather bordom with the intellectual complacency for anything bizaar. The nudity...come on now anyone who has made it through puberty should be over the giggly ""Oh look they are is naked"" by now. This is nether art nor good taste, but it is what they (the film industry)tell us we want. The movie as a whole has to much of everything that says ""you need to be really intellectual to understand it""...my feeling is the movie is naked...and this director and those who bought it could not see. Try Dr.Strangelove which is strange, and the characters are strange, but the issues (like the film) are black and white."
1,Possibly one of the worst movies I've seen.,"Is there any way I can get back the last three hours of my life? In the beginning, this movie had promise of being filled with intrigue and mystery with the brushing of the more taboo life of the secret yearning of human sexuality. While I can appreciate the story, it left little to fulfill any of the promises. Unless all you want is to see the naked forms of Kidman and Cruise...I'd suggest either picking up a book or a different movie."
2,The censored for dumb Americans version,"I'd hoped that the DVD would be the international cut, or (better yet) would take advantage of the ability of the DVD format to allow the user to select alternate edits. That way we could see the film as Kubrick intended. But no, apparently we just get the same censored version that played in US theaters, while the rest of the world gets Kubrick's original version.So despite it being a great film, I can't really give the US release of the DVD (or VHS) a great rating."
2,Bored me for 28 minutes,"Slow moving. I think I remember some interesting points made about the movie, but why the slow, boring start? Perhaps it gets better. Right now, I'd like to enjoy my evening with a good film.===Next day:Okay, I finished it tonight. Another boring scene with the wife and then it picked up. Although still slow, at least things happened. It's about a black magic cult with which the couple separately rubbed shoulders. All that you can take from it is the existence, power and evil of such practitioners, and know why teachers warn to avoid them. That's it.I raise my rating to a two. It could have been made exciting and enjoyable. It definitely has a French flair, if you know what I mean."
1,ABSOLUTELY PITIFUL!,"this complete waste of celluloid was nothing more than a wat-too-long episode of ""red shoe diaries""! please! why is it every time an artist dies, we're supposed to think of his or her posthumos works as ""sooo amazing""! this is the kind of movie that people THINK is so ""mind-bending"" and ""powerful"", but when you get down to it, is nothing more than mindless hype."
2,Eyes Completely Shut,"I don't know what I was expecting when I saw this movie, but whatever it was I don't think I got it. This movie wasn't pornography by any means, although sex is clearly a central theme. Tom Cruise's character always seems to be on the verge of having sex or exploring different sexual practices. That much I enjoyed, but my God this movie dragged. Painfully slow in most scenes, Eyes Wide Shut had me looking at the timer on my DVD player most of the time. This is no slight on the acting performances by Cruise and Kidman who are both quite good, it's more the creative aspect. The writing is dull; the music adds no drama or suspense but lulls you to sleep; and the scenery is overly stuffy. Maybe I was expecting something much greater since this was a Kubrick film, but no matter who directed it there is no excuse for a movie that nearly puts someone to sleep."
3,"Too long, too slow","Hard to believe that this is the same director who directed Clockwork Orange. I get the uber wealthy illuminati families, I always thought that's what went on in those huge mansions anyway, along with the satan worship and blood sacrifices. But, I didn't think it could be sooooooo long and boring. If it wasen't for the prettyness of the 2 main characters and skinny model nudity, no one would watch it or try to figure out what the ""deep"" meaning of it is suppose to be, Oh, did anyone else notice that in almost every scene there was a christmas tree with colored lights? Oh,wait, I get it now, life is ugly but, the colored lights are pretty. Very deep.When I do watch this movie, it really makes me wonder how Tom could divorce the beautiful Nicole for the blah Katie, no accounting for taste I guess, and was it a real marriage anyway? Enjoy!"
2,Auteurist stigma,"The sad thing about Stanley Kubric's career was the importance placed on absolutely every frame of every film he ever made. As this was his final opus many wanted to see the closing chapter in a perplexing drama about an auteur who never sold out. Eyes Wide Shut wasn't that film, in fact the direction is heavy handed, the acting stilted and false, and the script was loathsome and terrible at it's absolute best. For those who didn't get it, or don't understand the film, where were you? Eyes Wide Shut is so heavy handed from start to finish that it is just plain boring. There are some beautiful sequences, some thought provoking concepts, some nice imagery, definately, but why is everyone so afraid to say that it just wasn't that good? I have to point out how stupid it is to release on DVD a censored version of the film (at least we saw the real one here in Australia)! And not in widescreen either. How rediculous."
2,I was dissappointed,"Please tell me what logic, makes it necessary to start with a scene of Nicole Kidman sitting on the toilet? It escapes me. Shock value? Lost on me, because it wasn't pertinant to the movie. I found the discussion that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman about fidelity, the male and female version the only riveting portion of this movie. I found it heart rending when she went on about the naval officer. It was cruel & meant to be. The later scene with an adoring patient's daughter was an very interesting insight.Tom Cruise's reaction was so typical however. A bit of a dissappointment. The movie rambled on from that point never really explaining the ""orgy society group"" and it's larger vision.I think Stanley Kubrick would have polished this more had he lived."
2,Nonsense disguised as art.,"A boring movie with disturbing themes, nonsensical elements, and plenty of female nudity. As open-minded as I am, I could not find any redeeming qualities in this film...saw no purpose for it. And to be fair, as much as people have complained about the show of ""sex"" and nudity, I didn't care for the obvious lack of male nudity...if they're going to go so far with females, at least make it balanced (especially in the strange and dorky orgy scene). And where's Tom Cruise's bare *ss? You get to see plenty of Nicole Kidman! It's all just a bunch of krraaap! Just my two cents."
2,Probably worth the price of rental...if you're bored,"I can't say very many good things about this movie. Pretty poor and stupid storyline. Basically, nothing but Tom Cruise walking around coming close to having an affair. A lot of nude women on display ... this one will make a good one for late night cinemax some day."
4,"Good Movie, Blu-Ray Not So Good","I agree with Doug now that I bought this on Blu-Ray. I don't think they did anything other than just take it from the original film over to the Blu-Ray format. As such, it lacks the clarity of what I normally expect with my High-definition setup. This is a good buy, just keep in mind that this is not going to be Blu-Ray quality when you get it. However, I cannot complain because the Blu-Ray was cheaper than the DVD!You'll get mixed reviews on the movie itself, but I never saw it when it came out and this was my first time seeing the movie. I really enjoyed it and found that I was drawn in to the story to the point where I felt the stress Dr. Bill was going through."
3,If only...,"I've had these gloves for almost a year now. Mechanix gloves are very well made, the stitching is solid, good overall craftsmanship. These gloves do provide protection when working with a variety of hand tools.Pros:-Lightweight and breathable-Excellent design overall-Fit well, almost true to size-Provide some warmth in temperate weatherCons:-Velcro/hook & loop on wrist wears out fast-The thumb is a bit long, makes it necessary for contant readjustment-Stiching on some fingertips is unevenThe previous gloves I owned (also Mechanix), sufferened from even worse velcro than these. Sure, you can remove the velcro and replace it, but why bother? It would have been nice if there was a more durable material used that can withstand thousandsa nd thousands of opening and closings. Average lifespan of these gloves during normal use is about 16 months. I still have not found a better pair of gloves for the price."
2,Nice gloves but stitching does not hold up,"I purchased these gloves in January of this year... I didn't really get a chance to use them much but when, in March I finally got a chance to put them on and use them the stitching on the wrist disintegrated. Presently the elastic band at the bottom is just dangling and although usable... the gloves should not have come apart after one use. Because I have gone past the refund limit from Amazon I am not stuck with these gloves...this should be a warning to others.... try out your merchandise as soon as you get it.... put some wear on it... then you might stand a chance of getting a new item when you find it is faulty. My fault this time...The gloves do look and fit pretty well though...."
1,Cheap material,I received these gloves last week and tried them out for the first time yesterday. I am just a DIY'er that works on his own cars. I rotated the tires on my two vehicles and by the end the gloves were worn almost all the way through on several fingers and a place on the palms. I am confused as to why these gloves are for automotive use when they don't hold up to a few hours of wear.
2,DO NOT BUY!! RIPPED AFTER 2 WEEKS,I bought these for some home/gardening work and they ripped after 2 weeks. I specifically chose these gloves because they seemed to be sturdier than the 12 dollar ones. Save your money and find a different pair.
4,Last longer than regular Mechanix gloves...,"That about sums it up. A lil thicker, hair bit more cumbersome, but last longer. I smashed my hand with a hammer today in these gloves. Didn't hurt a lot."
1,How about just a little effort to be non-partisian?,"Ok, I know the author is some intellectual pointy-headed liberal, but how about some attempt to be fair. The Reagan chapter was so biased and hate-filled. And apparently, according to the author, everything was great during those wonderful Carter years. Spare yourself from reading the same liberaltalking points on the ""Evils"" of Ronald Reagan. Hey Alan baby, next time how about a little fair and balanced reporting and stop trying to cram down your liberal ideology down our throats.We get it, you don't like Reagan, now do your job as a responsible author and present a more accurate view of Reagan."
4,Sony Cybershot DSC-T50 7.2MP Digital Camera,"Overall a great camera. One disappointment was that I apparently was shipped the European version of the camera kit. I.e. It came with the non-US version of the battery charger (US version has the plug built into the charger, while non-US version has a cord) and the TV output was defaulted to European format (I eventually figured out how to set it to the US format)."
1,what was this?,"I have been a silverstein fan for the past couple years and when i heard this album was coming out, I was very enthused. Like all cds, i decided i wanted to download it before i purchased it. and thank god i did that. what i heard was horrible. it sounded like a high school rock band with little potential. Lyrics were predictable and the music in general was not even compairable of what their talent is. Should have spent more time in the studio writing lyrics and music. Next time please dont rush a release just because of the demand of it."
3,Not a replacement lockset,"Ordered this ultra high quality lockset but was dismayed when it would not directly fit my doors. All of my doors have the deadbolt and latch separated 6 inches on center. This lockset is set up at 5 inches on center. If you are installing on a new door it should be no problem, but do not buy this as a replacement for a current lockset unless you have measured your lock and latch and found them to be 5 inches apart (on center). Again,,this would appear to be a very high quality lockset. We did, however, find a Kwikset lockset which is made by the same ownership (Black & Decker/Stanley) that worked perfectly. Didn't even have to use anything to install but a Phillips screwdriver."
3,Calexi-who?,"What happened? are they going for the home run or what?I love the Calexico of yesterday......very reminiscent of Enio Morricone with a heart beat and pulse.If you liked Convict Pool, Feast of Wire or Even my sure things you will be disappointed in this new disc.It has very catchy hits, I could see it getting major radio play......theres a couple of good ones like ""Panic open strings"" and ""Roka"" shows influences of old.this disc may put them on the map but thats not the Calexico I wanna hear."
1,"Smith and Doe make themselves out to look like used up, man hating slags.","Saw the book in a store and thought it would be a great thing for me and my wife to have fun with. Once we took it home and started running through the equations, it became apparent that this book cannot in any way be serious. It paints out all men as worthless cheating lying scumbags. All of the equations involving men were either completely wrong about me, or were inapplicable, since I have no plans to cheat on my wife. The female related ones actually did seem to be milder and more 'truthful' which leads me to believe this is just a book to plant seeds of doubt in the minds of easily led astray women involving their own relationships. If a man isn't cheating on you right now, he will be in the future, or already has? That's a terrible thing to say to somebody.0/5 Would only recommend to man-hating women who have made terrible mistakes involving relationships in their past."
5,Best price for hard to find hardware,"We are restoring a 1950's house with this hardware on the knotty pine cabinets. I worried that I couldn't find replacements to match but here they are. Good price, quick delivery."
5,Great book for strengthening faith,The book really showed that we can rely on our great god jehovah to give us strength when things seem to impossible for us as mere humans to handle he truly is not far off from each one of us
5,Facing the Lion,"I loved this book as it shows a little girl other than the one we only hear about which was Anne Frank. This little girl, Simone, was from Alsace France. She was taken from her parents the Nazi's because she was one of Jehovah's Witnesses. All she had to do is ""heil Hitler"" and sign a paper renouncing her faith and they would have let her go. She told the school teachers that the only saviour was Jehovah. Many people don't realize that JW's were true martyrs as they could have been released just by signing a paper to renouce their faith. Hitler himself said, ""this brood shall be exterminated in Germany."""
5,A moving and vivid account,"This is a truly moving book. I was given a copy by a friend, and was enthralled. I couldn't put it down. I want everyone I know to read it. Such a fresh persective of the Nazi regime. From a young girl that was ""delinquent"" because she would not be molded by the Nazi machine. The triumph of good conquering evil, in a seemingly unwinnable fight. Thank you so much for your story Mrs. Liebster."
5,Great inspriational book!,Loved the book- great reading for faith-strengthening and appreciation for those that have truly struggled to keep their faith! Very informative and hard to put down!
5,Tearful and heartfelt,I found this book to be a very tear-jerking book and loved it. It took me only three days to read the book and helped me to do a school report. Simone was a girl just under my age and I could not imagine going through something like that. I have often wondered how Witnesses made it through that terrible time. I have come to realize that God does give us the strngth to carry on and that he gave Simone and her family that strength as well. This book was a very good book to read and I would recommend it to many.
3,a fine (though curious) entry into the series,"THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN is a fine (though a little curious) entry into the fabulous FAERIE TALE THEATRE series. Curious that the subject matter isn't really a fairytale. The story comes from the famed poem by Robert Browning.Eric Idle is perfectly-cast as the enigmatic Piper of the title, and also appears as Browning himself at the beginning of the tale (serving as Narrator as well).Fine production values and capable direction from Nicholas Meyer keep this episode sleek and stylish, though little children may find it somewhat boring."
4,IT IS VERY GOOD,"It is a very good multivitamin and its very hard to find in stores. I like this product a lot, the only problem I have with it is the size of the pills, too big."
4,Good mystery but ...,"I enjoyed this mystery for the most part. This is the second book in the series and I am going to read/buy the first and third one, too. I really like the main character Flip. She was funny and interesting. I loved her romance with the town's lawyer.What I didn't like: 1) Flip was not investigating as much as falling into the mystery; and 2) there was no murder! I thought that there would be because most mysteries involve murder but there wasn't one. So it was somewhat disappointing.If you don't mind that there is no murder, then you'll enjoy this book I'm sure."
1,Don't waste your time,"This film is boring, slow moving and not worth a viewing. The theme is disturbing-an older man having an affair with a teenager."
1,Came broken,This DVD came in the case cracked. Therefor it was unwatchable.I needed this movie for a film and literature paper and I ended up having to rent it via iTunes.
3,Great Bluray transfer but NO Special Features,"I am not going to review the movie which is one my favorite movies (most people compare it to the book and rate it very low) maybe it's because I have not read the book, I think the movie works. Bluray transfer is great but there are no special features. For such a classic movie, I expected some commentaries, featurettes to satisfy my appetite but there is nothing (except for the 45 seconds trailer of ""making of Lolita"" which consists of shots from the movie). If you wish to buy the Bluray because of its picture/sound quality, go ahead. But you won't find any extras on this edition."
5,Lolita,"A brilliant adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel penned by the author himself, Kubrick's ""Lolita"" satirizes the vulgar desires and warped intellect of Humbert, magnificently played by Mason. Upgrading Lolita's age to make the film palatable to audiences in 1962, Kubrick emphasized the farcical aspects of the source material, drawing an extraordinary performance from Sellers, who plays Humbert's lecherous (and oft-disguised) writer friend Clare Quilty. Winters is by turns perky and melancholic as the unwitting Charlotte. You'll fall hard for the daring ""Lolita."""
4,Great,I was very happy with my purchase. I don't know how I was going to charge the rechargable battery in the Sansa View that I bought with only the USB to computer charger that it comes with. A must have.
1,Waste of money,Did not work at all. Fleas where alive and well after several days of using this product. Do not waste your money on this product.
4,Great product!,"This carpet powder worked wonders. No flea problems now where we put it. Actually, I gave it 4 stars because of the price. There is powder at Walmart for less than $4.00 that worked the same."
4,A masterpiece apart from the rest,"Meat puppets (self titled) may be a louder, more agressive, seemingly nonsensical collection of songs but it should not be dismissed. The fast pace of Kurts guitar riffs is here and many of the songs are so short that it's easy to miss them but as long as you listen to this album with an open mind you can hear it for it's individuality, just don't expect it to be much like the other fine Pups offerings. First timers to the Pups should probably go for Meat Puppets II instead, for an easier introduction."
2,"You loved ""Up on the Sun"" so you bought this","And then you were left checking the two CDs to see if they were made by the same band. It is hard to believe the many different sounds that came from one truly weird band. Sometimes they were punk, sometimes pop, sometimes country, sometimes noise, often times insane. Well, God bless them, they really put out some great albums, but this really is not one of them. This is kind of avant garde crazy noise."
3,This purse is okay for the price,"I like this purse just fine. Although, after using it for a couple of weeks the seam of the inner lining came undone and I had to do some serious digging for my keys after they fell through the hole. It was an easy repair; 2 minutes with needle and thread, but it's still frustrating to repair a new purse. But I love the style, plenty of pockets and space inside, and the price!"
4,Tone it up!,"Looking for a good full body toning video? This is it. Works all the major muscle groups. Easy to follow. You can add more weights as you get stronger. It seems like they really want you to use a barbell for the workout. One of the ""rippers"" uses dumbbells, but they don't always show her on screen. You will need to use a step for a bench and you also need a mat. Overall, a good beginner video, with the opportunity to advance."
3,"Eh, Just ok","I like this video because it is a full body weight training routine, but, that is all that I like about it. The set is ugly, the ""rippers"" are not engaging, the music is horrible and in some of the moves they do a close up of Jeri's face and head and not of anyone doing the excercise. Makes no sense when you are trying to watch their form. This video came in a set and that is the only reason I have it. If you are looking for a great full body weight training video, this is a good one as long as you can ignore everything else about the video and just lift weights."
5,Hardcore workouts!,I have not been disappointed with this set. The videos are really intense and produce amazing results. These are the only strength training videos I have done that really get my heart rate up. After one of these videos I am usually exhausted and I can definitely feel it the next day.
5,punk rock history,"a piece of history, this is an extremely important compilation! The best of all Black Flag music right behind the great Damaged! Get these both albums!"
2,37 recipes for techniques & presentation of the common spud,"(...). I got my money's worth on the fancy presentation for Maxim's potatoes, which lists only potatoes and clarified butter as ingredients. If you have a mandoline, the recipe is a snap!This book series offers simple recipes that teach one or two culinary techniques per recipe. Every recipe is shown in a photo. It's a thin hardback book, only 1/2-inch thick. If you're in a potato rut, maybe this book will free you. I gave it only 2 stars because there are so few recipes."
3,I Do. I Did. Now What?! Life After the Wedding Dress,"While it was a fun book to read, it was not at all what I thought it would be. I was looking for a book to help me with my nerves about my own wedding. The book jacket promises; how to meet other couples, cleaning compromises, and other mysteries solved. I really didn't see what mysteries it solved, nor to it answer any of the other promises. Like I said before it was fun to read, its short and quick, but does it answer any questions, I didn't think so. I also read The Conscious Bride by Sheryl Nissinen. When I looked at it the first couple of times I thought it was a book trying to talk you out of getting married, not so. It really makes you think about different aspects of your engagement and relationship, now that was a helpful book!"
2,Sophomoric,"The book was so sophomoric that I quit reading it after about 20 pages. Maybe it's great after the 20th page, but the characters didn't interest me at all. Also, it didn't seem real. I like Jay, but he's better than this subject matter at this stage of his career."
3,An over the top party girl,"If this were a story of a party girl without the baggage, I probably would have enjoyed it more. This girl has serious problems. Maybe they are family caused as the book tries to allude or maybe it's the easy money which suddenly starts to dry up. Irrespective, this girl is so self-destructive that at some point it gets pathetic. But at least the book is consistent as virtually every other single girl in the book has self-destructive qualities. I'm somewhat surprised that a Women's Lib group didn't have problems with this book on that pretext.Irrespective, I did enjoy the book visualizing the single life in New York in the 80s. Read this book if you want to know what the party scene in New York is like for a spoiled self-absorbed princess. If not, take a pass."
1,i would rather kill myself,"This is the worst book i've ever read. Honestly don't buy this book, buy a large piece of wood and beat yourself over the head with it. You'll get the same effect as you would reading the book and it'll be cheaper and take less time. This book is the worst thing in the world, don't buy it."
4,Shallow characters you actually LIKE...,"This is a perfect synopsis of the 80's girl with too much yet not enough money/too much cocaine/too many men. It's highly enjoyable when you're home on a rainy day. Most significantly, the characters, who are for the most part shallow and demanding, are rather likable. Perhaps it's because they remind us of someone we may already know. Definitely get this and spend a lazy Saturday with it."
2,"Too little wit, too late","To be honest, a bit of a disappointment, especially after the build-up it receives in the chapter on Veblen in Heilbroner's classic The Worldly Philosophers. As always, Veblen tends toward the verbose, but here your effort is rarely rewarded with the wit that pervades Veblen's earlier works such as ""A Plea for Cannibalism"" and ""An Apology for a Toper"". It's quite a bit into the book before Veblen suggests his remedy for bloated American universities: simply fire everyone who works in the administrations, because all of their work is superfluous anyway. While this suggestion struck a sympathetic chord with me-as my own frustrating experiences with the multi-layers of bureaucracy at the University of Chicago probably mirror Veblen's own-this aside came too late in the book to relieve my overall boredom with it."
5,one of the best punk albums of all time,"Creative, original, ingenius! Intriguing music blends with thoughtful lyrics to make an album that will stand and has stood the test of time."
3,I only LOVE 3 songs on this...,"I LOVE tracks 33, 20 and 9 -THEY RULE!!! Track 9 is very addictive to me.Otherwise I'm not really into the other songs on this album -usually the way it goes with me for alot of bands I like anyway."
4,Fascinating and fun,"I was inspired to look back to this amazing release by the book Our Band Could Be Your Life, and I wasn't disappointed. I only had a vague recollection of the Minutemen from the 80s so I wasn't quite sure what was in store, but even a typically tinny SST production job can't mask the raw creativity, energy and excitement over the course of an almost ridiculous 43(!) tunes."
5,Greatest album ever.,"I got into the Minutemen about a year or so ago from a recomendation from a guy I mey on the internet. I have this on vinyl, which is much better because of the 2 songs that they had to cut off for the CD, and the vinyl was 5 bucks cheaper, but I would sure as hell pay the extra 5 for this.Words can't describe this album, I don't think there is one low point on the entire record. Mike and George are probably the best rythum section ever, and D.'s guitar work is just simply incredible.I really do believe that the Minutemen are the greatest band ever, better than any of those bands like Zeppelin and the Beatles that always get all of the credit for that kind of thing. This album is the finest effort from the greatest band ever. I will never get bored of this."
1,PUNK?,OK I JUST WANT 2 NO HOW THIS MUSIC IS SUPOSED 2 BE PUNK CUZ IT AINT. THERE ARE A LOT OF SONGZ ON HERE BUT THA PROBLEM IS THEY ALL SOUND THA SAME AND THEY AINT EVEN PUNK THEY SOUND LIKE ALTRENATIVE OR SOMETHING. THIS CD'S GOT MORE SONGS THAN ANY OTHER CD I OWN BUT I STILL CANT FIND 1 SONG I LIKE ON IT. IF U PPL THINK U CAN HANDLE TRU HARDCORE PUNK THEN CHECK OUT OLD KORN AND LIMP BIZKIT P.O.D. OR STAIND.
3,"Buy ""Alive"" Instead","Even flow and Oceans(this single-version is quite well too) are classics(Even flow is certainly one of the best PJ songs... My favorite Hit, after ""Do the evolution"") so.. why not buy it? I explain. The whole problem is ""Dirty Frank"". The song follows ""No Code tendencies"" of cuttin'-edge songs that droped down PJ sale charts by this Album. At Least No Code is cool, interesting. ""Dirty Frank"" is boring. If you don't have ""Ten"", go Ahead, it's a nice choose, really. But If you've already bought ""Ten"" and wants a single... Add ""Alive"" to your charting, not this one! Safe your ears from the one of the few Eddie's Miskates. Have a Nice Day"
1,PRETENTIOUS CRAP...,"i dunno,one could say this was a progression from their Ramones - influenced hardcore beginnings,but i find it much less entertaining.with Greg Ginn's ""noodling""(read:noise)coupled with Henry Rollin's poet aspirations,this just comes across as pretentious crap to me,especially listening today"
5,Excellent Book,"the book first i have seen in amazon.com site index. just for fun like i bought the same. then i started reading the book. the book was very interesting for me. during reading this book, i could not interested to do any other work.that much it was impressed me.thanks for writer of this book and publishers. Prasad vvsv"
3,Chamberlain Keypad,Got this about five years ago and it died. Got the same one again because I believe the fault lay in my kids leaving the cover up an rain getting on it.
1,Inadequate Information Supplied for Purchase,The product description failed to state that the keypad was intended for garage door openers manufactured prior to a certain date. My garage door opener was new. It was sent back to Amazon for a quick return and credit to my account. Thanks.
2,Achievement Unlocked - best thing in TMNT,"TMNT is a passable action/adventure game geared more towards kids and inexperienced gamers. The main content of the game has you as the members of the Turtles performing ninja acrobatics to cross the city of New York to get to a rare fight with a couple baddies or a boss. There is really no risk of failure in the game since whether you fall off a building whilst attempting acrobatics or you come up short in a fight with an enemy, your Turtle just springs back to life. There is no depth in gameplay as everything can be accomplished with ease.The best thing about TMNT is that you will achieve at least 900 gamerscore, and with only a little extra effort you will gather the full 1000 gamerscore. It took me five hours of gametime to get the 1k. If you want to boost your gamerscore by 1000 and pay budget price for a game, this is the one to get. The five hours are fun enough."
2,Needed a family Tree in thebook,"This book was very slow going as I tried to keep up with who was related to whom, who died, who.....Clearly I needed to have read from the beginning, not the sixth book, to understand that was going on. I gave up which I do not often do. I think this is the type of writer that you either really like or not at all. I for one was disappointed, but then I am a British mystery buff so that might be the problem:-).A Mystery Bred In Buckhead"
3,"Not as memorable as ""To Sir, With Love""","I read this a couple of months ago, and all I can tell you at this point is that it's about his time as a social worker in England, after the time period of ""To Sir, With Love."""
5,Husker Du is Neil Young on speed,"Neils rocks hard, Huskers rock fast.Both are the greatest bands of my listening pleasure."
2,i just sold it to a used cd store,"I really wanted to like this album. It gets rave reviews from all the right people, and tons of bands cite it as an influence. Well maybe I am missing something, but the vocals, passionate though they may be, are incredibly grating. They simply don't sound good. The guitar is loud and fast but not very innovative or catchy; indeed, like most hardcore guitar. After listening to the entire thing four or five times, I still couldn't really pin any of the songs down in my mind - they all sounded like part of the same mush. Maybe this is partly due to incredibly poor production, but these songs just don't seem very strong. Either this is one of the most overrated albums ever, or I need to have my ears examined."
5,Husker Du were grunge before there was grunge,Husker Du is a tremendously talented band. Both Zen Arcade and Warehouse are essential recordings for anyone wanting a full anthology of the 80's indie rock scene.
5,TMNT is back!,The beast TMNT game on ds i bought this game for my sons 8th b-day i grew up with the organl tmnt it's alot of fun but hard
1,Total Waste of Money,"This product didn't have any effect whatsoever; no matter how much I played it, he could not care less and continued to scream his head off."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I have purchased other movies in this vein, but the transfer to the DVD is awful. It was probably transferred from a very poor quality VHS tape. The music is garbled. The video quality is so poor that we could not identify what we were seeing on the screen. The colors were terribly distorted. It is very unfortunate that a movie with such great potential has not been transferred from a better source."
4,New Edition Better Than The Reviews,"The other reviews for this DVD are correct. It was taken from a VHS source and the audio is distorted. As someone who worked on the project I can say that the earlier version reviewed on this page was not supposed to be released to the public, but that a very good quality copy has now been issued in it's place. We regret some people have purchased an inferior product and if they would get in touch with Topics Entertainment a newer and much better disc will be exchanged. You will like this show. It's very similar to the Over America series, also seen on PBS, showing Colorado in all it's magnificent splendor."
3,"Not ALL ""Jehovah's Witnesses""","While this gentleman's stand is certainly commendable and his story moving, there IS one aspect of the whole ""Jehovah's Witnesses"" in the concentration camps issue which is never touched upon by these books, but is very important.Those in the camps referred to as ""Jehovah's Witnesses"" were in fact Bible Students (Bibelforschers); many whom were NOT affiliated with the WT, then or after. They were all labeled with the same ""purple"" triangle and lumped together. These faithful Bible Students who suffered and died in these camps too, NEVER associated with the Watchtower organization and were NEVER ""Jehovah's Witnesses"", a name not yet adopted at the time in Germany. Out of respect for these individuals this distinction SHOULD be made.Sincerely,(Bible Student - NOT JW)"
3,Interesting... but too schoolastic,"I found the history of Mexico through it's food to be very interesting, and this book certainly covered it. Unfortunately, it covered it in a very dry; college textbook fashion, making reading what is a facinating subject a real chore. The author repeatedly re-used information that he'd presented earlier to make his point, making it monotonous. If a real author would ghost-write this book, you really would have something."
1,Model 950CB or 971LM are for older Security+ Openers,Note this unit did not work for me. I called Chamberlain and they said this unit is for older security + units that operate at 390 and the newer models like the one I purchased HD200D operate on 315 frequency. For newer units that use 315 the correct remote is the 371LM or 950D
1,Remote OK but stay away from AAAREMOTES,"These guys are the classic flim-flam artists. I bought the receiver and remote from them as a package only to find out that the remote they sold me didn't work (different frequency) with the receiver. (Gee, don't you think THEY would have known that they worked on different frequencies. What was the guy on the phone thinking???) Anyway, I returned it at my expense, they then charged me shipping up front for the replacement. It's now a month later and I still haven't received it. Their ""Lack of Customer Service"" department tells me it is back-ordered. BUT, as of today (june 25, 2007) it is listed as ""In Stock"" here on Amazon.My advice... STAY AWAY"
1,"Tried to return, no response.",The item was sent in a timely manner but I ordered the wrong model. I sent several emails trying to return but never received a response.
1,whrong product,company send me the whrong product and i send it back for credit but they deduct the shipping charges and is was not my fault that they send that product. I think was not fare that they could do that to their custumers if is their mistake. Very dasaponted. I lost over 14 dollar in this deal.why??? MR.ADORNO
2,one book?,"Like Nina, I was expecting the 2 volume set and only received volume 2. This does me no good as I need both volumes for my assigned reading."
3,"Switching Works Out-of-the-Box, but no Webview","I originally purchased a Netgear GS748T. I had constant connection problems with certain ports, and Netgear tech support is useless.I got the Linksys SRW2048. The switching worked out-of-the-box, so I'm happy enough to keep it. But the Webview doesn't work at all, which is irritating.I give it 3 stars. Could be worse (like Netgear's product). Could be better (fully functional)."
5,Very enjoyable mystery series.,"Very enjoyable mystery series. I loved all of the books in this series. I loved the outdoor atmosphere, the fishing, and the excellent characters and stories. I recommend them all and wish there were more."
4,Awesomelly sugar free - but individually wrapped..Why?,For sugar free they taste just like normal ones but without the diabetes inducing after effects. Just be careful not to eat all of them at one time. You will get seriously pooty.
2,Jelly Belly,Too expensive! Each piece individually wrapped was a bit of a pain but not a good value for the price.
4,Nice Hi Ends,"These will add a nice high end to your car sound. They are easy to use and I love the swivle connector that came in the pack I installed them on. Now I can place the high sound in what direction I want. But they sound good running off the head unit, and I've connected the sub and you can still hear enough of the high ends. I recommend these for the price. Unbeatable!!!"
5,benefit is greater than cost,"My system is LOUD to the point car alarms go off and the dishes rattle in the kitchen. It was missing something and these tweets completed it. It sounds perfect, turned down or up. My friend spent less money on a cheap brand stating they were tweeters and I would waste my money but these have sucha clear sound that I was shocked when I got in his car and could barely tell his were installed. I highly recommend these to anyone willing to pay a decent price and getting more than what they paid for! Cheers"
3,Theyre OK,"I have had these for a month or so, they still work but I will be replacing them soon. They sound okay but I have heard better. I have them crossed over at about 2000 hz, that's probably the only reason they havent blown yet. Would I buy them again? Probably not."
4,FANTASTIC !!!,"thses little suckers were under-estimated before i installed them, They pack a punch, perfect crisp tweets, very clear. Im very satisfied."
1,Terrible,"Dont buy these, tried them out today, just SSSSSSSSSSS, and not loud either. I thought they would be better. Next: Selenium ST350, I KNOW these sound great."
1,Operation We're Starting to Blow,My War marks the period when Black Flag grew their hair out and tried to be Black Sabbath. Henry poses like Charles Manson and Ginn goes back on the Sweet Leaf. The mission fails miserably. Everything Went Black is the only Flag cd worth owning.
4,hardcore comes into its own,"From the other reviews you'll probably gather that My War took Black Flag in a new direction filled with jazzier rythms, dischordant melodies, and less formulaic song structures. If you ask me, My War is the dividing line between punk and hardcore. I love 3-chord punk, but limiting yourself to rigid constraints doesn't make a great band. My War made the similarity between the punk and hardcore scenes one of spirit, not sound."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This was a disappointment. The finish is awful - gloppy varnish covering the whole thing, including hinges. Looks nothing like the picture. Quality control is apparently nonexistent."
4,Personal Perspective,"My feelings are the opposite of the ""Reader from Washington"" who reviews Frum's book here. I in fact DID want the personal perspective of a White House staffer and that's what I got in this excellently written narrative. If anything, I would have traded some of Frum's political analysis (perceptive as it is) for still more anecdotes.The account of the 9/11 experience of the White House staffers by itself makes the book a worthwhile read. Kaddish on a PalmPilot!"
3,"Good, but not as good as FIGHTING BACK","Maybe my mistake was reading THE RIGHT MAN immediately after I finished Bill Sammon's FIGHTING BACK. The latter is so thrilling and enjoyable that even a good book like THE RIGHT MAN pales in comparison. But no, wait--that's not accurate. While Mr. Frum's book is at times fast-paced and exciting, there are whole chapters (like the one entitled ""The Religion of Peace"") that are slow and difficult to get through. I found myself putting this book down repeatedly, while Mr. Sammon's book hardly ever left my grasp. FIGHTING BACK is in a different league. It stands alone as a heart-stopping narrative of what was going on behind the scenes and in front of the cameras on that day of infamy, September 11, 2001, and in the months that followed. THE RIGHT MAN, however, is an often tedious account of one man's view of life inside the White House."
2,"Democracy, not theocracy","When Bush the Elder began talking of the ""New World Order"", I was filled with dread for the future. Now, when I read of national policymakers holding White House bible study sessions, I join the ranks of the terrorized. Professor Paul R. Henggeler's just-published article on this book at least gives me some sorely needed comfort. Past presidents have made similar mistakes, and yet America survives. I do continue to wonder though how such esteemed policy advisors could be so timid as to submit to group bible study with their colleagues. The more the world sees, rightly or wrongly, an administration driven by religious beliefs, the more difficult our position in the world will become. War has everything to do with man and his weaknesses and nothing to do with anyone's God."
4,ONE OF 2005'S BEST!!,"I don't usally go around buying new groups or artist's cds. but when i heard PCD's seond single ""stickwitu"" I had to buy the cd and i wasn't 1% disappointed. what excited me the most about the pussycat dolls is cuz they're not a typical pop group. their music is hardcore R&B-; Hip-hop and oriental music and cuz i'm from a country in the middle east i was easily liked their music.best tracks: ""Don't Cha"",""Stickwitu"",""Beep"",""Wait a minute"",""Sway"" and ""I don't need a man""."
2,"If you like just the radio hits, dont buy the CD","I liked the 3 songs that have been played on the radio ""don't cha"" ""beep"" and ""buttons"", enough to buy the CD via Amazon of course and was dissapointed in the CD after those songs played and the Cd continued onto it's less than average fare. I wanted to cry and say my god, I bought this trash. I will only play at the most 4 songs on the CD and skip all the other ones. The point of my rant is if you like the songs playing on the radio and every where else, dont expect more of the same once you buy the CD it's a let down. I bought the CD b/c I wanted fast music, not boring remakes of '50s ballads. The last what seems like 5 songs come from a different decade, so you could tell they were short on material. Sad shame they used others music and acted like they could sing it better. If I wanted 50's music trust me...i'd buy it elsewhere."
1,Don'cha wish they'd just go away?,"Oh boy! Here we go! The Pussycrap Dolls try for respectability in the music business! NO WAY WILL THESE ""GRRLZZ"" EVER BE RESPECTABLE IN ANY BUSINESS EXCEPT BEING HIGH-PAID PROSTITUTES! You blew your wad on your first single, and you will now go down in video history as a one-hit wonder (although I don't know how much of a hit it was). I say again, ""POP MUSIC SUCKS these days, and anyone who buys into this crap doesn't deserve ears. Now please, just fade away, or get pregnant, or whatever. Just don't tell me you're anywhere near me."
2,Pussycat dolls,"Well, this CD is okay but unfortunately the two tunes that they released on the radio are probably the best on the CD."
3,It's ok,"To pete ""snake"" if you don't like pop and rap then why are you reviewing it?...why are you listening to it?...you listen to nu metal and cristising people's taste in music? are you kidding me? nu metal has to be the worse form of rock music ever created and also half of those bands you mention stink. those guys are good at screaming and yelling over guitars....such great music(being sarcastic)now back to the review...this cd is ok...too many covers as far as i am concern and beep is annoying. but overall its ok."
1,* 0 stars PCD= short for partially correct dump,"I wrote a review earlier but this one is what I really meant. These 6 stripper hoes don't know how to sing. The only pretty ones are Jessica, Ashley and Melody. But you don't know who they are because Nicole's ugly ass is all up in the camera. Carmit is butt ugly with her red hair"
4,I thought it was pretty good,"Had more fillers than actual songs. ALL THE SONGS THAT YOU HEAR ON THE RADIO ARE ALL THEIR GOOD SONGS. Except another song that I can't think of right now. But, the rest of the cd is filler but since there is like 11 or 10 tracks and 5 of them are out majority of that cd is good."
1,Pussycat Dolls???,I seriously thought they had something to do with playboy.They have no talent.They're not attractive.The songs are bland and unoriginal.I got this cd as a gift from my aunt [...]
2,What is this?,"I did like the sond don't cha, but the rest is so whats the word horrible! They say its about empowerment for woman, that far from the truth! Real powerment would mean to tell woman not to be objects, like dolls wish to be! If you like a few songs, record it off the radio or on the internet! Don't waste money, the strippers have alot already! By the way, why is only one girl singing? This is worst then any other boy and girl group ever! Dose the rest of the girls have any talent what so ever?"
1,fanta girl wannabe strippers go pop,"this is so dvoidoffunk enjoy the pussycat dolls while you can I doubt they'd have a big sophmore effort just a fad this is just awful pop mainstream nonsense take took notes from madonna the slut, and skanky ass britney and pisstina."
1,Spice Girls With No Spice.,"""PCD"" may stand for Pussycat Dolls, but for all I know, it could also stand for Pretty Crappy Drivel. Jeez, how much lower can the music industry stoop? Now, don't get me wrong. I like guilty pleasure pop as much as the next Spice Girls or Justin Timberlake fan, but ""PCD"" is guilty pleasure pop that's high on guilt and low on pleasure. ""Don't Cha"" is passable radio-fluff; imagine a filtered-down Destiny's Child with just a fraction of Beyonce's sass. ""Stickwitchu"" and ""Waitaminute"" go in one ear and right out the other, and they have the unmitigated gall to ruin ""Tainted Love,"" a old tune Soft Cell made famous back in 1982. Would anyone old enough to remember Soft Cell's version appreciate the Pussycat Dolls' version? Highly unlikely. ""PCD"" gets the dubious honor for making a great argument in favor of copy-protected CDs. That's because no kind person should rip and burn music this bad for his/her friends."
5,HOT ALBUM A MUST IN ANY MUSIC COLLECTION!!!!!!,"I just got done listening to the new Pussycat Dolls cd called PCD!!!!! The album has a blend of dance,pop,r&b, and some hip hop!!!!! I still think that they should have changed the title of their cd to High Energy,because that is what you get from the pussycat dolls is energy and danceable songs!!!!!!! This is a must in any music collection and when it comes out go out and get yourself a copy!!!!!!!"
2,Burlesque stars?,"The saucy PCD's emerged as sultry overnight celebrities who instilled the tune of ""Dont'cha"" in everyone's head . . . when really what we should have been humming is ""Dont'cha wish your album was hot like Beyonce's?"" - because clearly, these dolls should have stuck to what they know best - their live shows. Agreeably, the girls have talent. They can sing. I thought this album would have been jam-packed with attitude and sauciness, however, it was not. There are some tracks on the album like, ""Buttons"" which is lacking that special ingredient, but the lyrics are right on. ""Feelin' Good, Tainted Love & Hot Stuff"", should have been left to rest, just the way we remember them, as originals, not as badly produced covers. In my opinion the only other hit on the album is ""Bite the Dust"" - the girls have nailed this tune with just the right amount of infectious lyrics, the beats are the type that make you move, - all in all, it's another ""Dont'cha"""
3,"Why, why, why?","I bought this for my wife, but now I have to listen to it all the time. Like I don't hear enough of it at the gym.EVERYONE GO OUT AND BUY CRASS' ""JESUS CHRIST-THE ALBUM!"""
2,Did anyone edit this book?,"There are several sections in this book that were clearly not revised for version 8.0 of Maya. This includes both visual examples and the writing. Turn to page 252: ""You can select the specific attribute and zoom in on its curve to see it better, or now with Maya 7, you can normalize the. . ."" Inexcusable.Additionally, it would really help if some of the instructional examples were in color, particularly those showing wireframe models. It's difficult to tell what's going on when what would normally be highlighted on the wireframe is grey like the rest of the model.Otherwise, the author writes pretty well. I appreciated the sense of humor, too."
2,Not for beginners!,"As a 3D artist using another program, I should have had few problems picking this up. But the instructions are written for version 8, which is not the version supplied on the accompanying CD. You'll search for hours for the menus and commands that simply aren't there because you're using Maya PLE version 7! (Luckily I found an earlier book version that uses the correct menu commands.) Don't buy THIS book until you can get your hands on Maya PLE version 8. It's not inside."
2,Very thin padding.,"The size and general features are fine (zipper, backpack like straps, pocket in the front)but the padding is so thin. It feels like it won't protect the guitar at all, except against very minor tension or nicks. I think its worth it to get a more heavy duty one if you want to actually protect the guitar. If you just need it for superficial transport, it should suffice."
2,would not have bought it had I known,"It is too large for a guitar. So, it is too bulky. I will go to a store and get a new case/bag that fits a guitar."
4,Good enough,"Good bag. I've had it for 2 months and it hasn't torn or zippers have not come off. It basically provides a covering for your guitar. No real padding. I put my $100 guitar in it. For the price of the bag, you can't expect much. It does what it's suppose to."
4,A great case,"This case is sturdy, and the outer pocket is great for carrying books and papers. It would be perfect if it contained an inner pocket. But you can't have everything in one product; it is just what my son needed because he takes his guitar with him everywhere!"
5,Great product,"This is a very durable case, it looks well made and the guitar fits well. I like the back strap and to handle options to cary the case.Well worth the money. I would buy another except I only have one guitar."
3,Sorry Folks...not a new recording of Julie Andrews.,"I got this thinking it was going to be Julie Andrews singing these great songs. It's not! It's the original film versions, which is ok but still then file it under ""DISNEY MUSIC"" or something other than Julie Andrews. In record stores, it's located under Julie Andrews which makes you think, it's really her singing the tunes. I think it's great she is the Disneyland spokesperson for the 50th anniversary and I can't think of anyone better but this CD is very misleading. Let's hope she actually records something again really soon, like ""Julie Andrews SINGS her Favorite Disney tunes""."
1,Disney's deception,"This CD is a deception. It's NOT Julie Andrews singing, but just a compilation of songs she likes. From the title and the cover, you'd expect Julie to be singing, and that is why I bought the CD. When I listened to it, I found out I already had virtually all the songs in the original albums. Only tiny letters in the back cover tell you it's just a compilation, but who reads those in the store? I obviously returned it, and the store manager agreed with me it was a deception, because he too thouhgt it was Julie singing. If you want Julie singing Disney songs, look for it somewhere else. Shame on you, Julie, who agreed to such deception on your fans!"
3,Another great book BUT... *WHY* did you change the book's SIZE?,"I am a huge fan of both the artwork and themes that this series of books by DB Johnson explores (the notions of enjoyment vs pure efficiency, of civil disobedience, of the power of the imagination, of less is more, and so many other important lessons). HOWEVER, I have a pet peeve: as a loyal collector of the series, it is REALLY ANNOYING that this latest book is a totally different page size so that it does not sit on a shelf in line with the other books in the series-- in fact, the size is SO different that I've had to put this latest book on its spine so that it will fit on the same shelf as the others! Your editorial team is asleep on the job!"
2,It Takes One To Know One,I gave this book 2 stars because I agree with the basic premise that the Catholic Church and her Jesuits are the arch enemy of Christ and his Church. They have in fact been instrumental in many dastardly deeds throughout the course of the last 1500 years or so. The problem with this booklet is the last chapter in which it becomes obvious that it has been published by an anti-christian organisaton. They believe if you worship on the Lord's Day (1st day of week) instead of the Jewish Sabbath (7th day of week) that you have the mark of the beast. This absolutely unbiblical doctrine shows that they are just as opposed to the Kingdom Of Christ as the Catholic Church. It seems that the pot is calling the kettle black !
1,Hate speech,"This book (pamphlet?) is merely anti-catholicism propaganda. Premise? That the Jesuits caused all evil, from every assassinated US President to the sinking of the Titanic.It reads like every other conspiratorial book. Simply replace the Jesuits with the Jews, the Arabs, International Bankers, the Rothschilds, or the Rockefellers.The story is the same in each case, just the main character changes."
4,Decent map.,"I've got several maps of Colorado. This one is pretty good. I like the recreational section. It shades the state and federal lands in different colors. The best part about the recreational section is the hunting GMU units. The Colorado DOW website is better, but this is good for a quick reference.The shaded relief is good. If the scale was a little smaller and it was topo I'd probably give it 5 stars. I'd probably recommend that a person buy the DeLorme topo, or Roads of Colorado before this one. This one has a few trails, roads, and details that those do not have which makes it a decent alternative."
1,Don't Bother,"If the level of your sophistication about relationships, science fiction, or science is on a par with that of an eighth grade girl imprisoned in her hormone storm, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, don't bother. Ms. Wells writes poorly, and understands little about anything she presumes to write about, except, perhaps, shallow sex."
3,it's the formal tense,"well, I'm a beginner and really enjoyed these tapes - until I ran into my korean friends and tried to actually use my new knowledge. they gave me a startled look: it's the very formal and old-fashioned tense that nobody really seems to use..."
4,I Liked This Book,"I very much liked this book. I had loaned it out to a co-worker who never returned it. So I bought another copy. Yes, it is that engaging. I found the book very easy to follow and the descriptions of places and battles were excellent. It is an excellent work."
4,Family Man,"This one's good. They could have blended the tracks together instead of spoken-tracks-first-then-music-tracks, though. Anyway, the instrumental tracks on here have to be Ginn's and Kira's best, especially 'Long Lost Dog'. 'Let Your Fingers' would definitely sound good with music, but for dramatics is best without it. A good CD to get if you're into spoken word."
4,"A bit different, but still wonderful","It warns on the cover: ""a spoken word/instrumental CD"". Well, that's just what you get. The Rollins spoken word, though not consistently relevant, is thoroughly chilling and provides for a good ""once in a while"" listen. The instrumental part is just like the material from Process of Weeding Out, and is definitely an acquired taste and a difficult listen. However, if you (like me) enjoy the later era of Black Flag, you will probably love this album. It's not the best of the Flag, but it's probably their most experimental."
3,Good but not perfect,"It does all it says & all, but I've had problems with the compatiblity (doesn't always digest well with XP or Vista) or so I've had occasional issues (always resolvable but you'd think that would not be a problem with a professionally licensed software). But in the end, it does work as described and I do get great use out of it as the software saves a lot of time updating contacts & number, etc."
2,Crap.,"What is wrong with you people? I've listend to these songs over and over again until I can no longer listen to them and still I can not find any sign of brilliance or musical mastery. I admit, these guys are creative, but that doesn't necessarily have to be a good thing. The vocals are horrible, and the whole album feels sloppy and unpolished. The only thing that even let's out a little shimmer of talent is the guitar work, which I admit is awesome, and that's the reason I gave this album a star. I gave it another star for the rhythm section, which is ok, but not great or innovating. The simply horrible vocals lose a star, and the overall messy production of the album lose 2 stars. This may be regarded as a classic in the alternative/ indie rock category, but compared to more masterful works, it is just a raw, jumbled mess."
5,It was a great book,It was a excellent book and I enjoy reading about the various branches of the usa military. I give it two thumbs up!
4,"Includes appearances by Rudy, the old codger from ""Survivor!","I agree with the general comments of reviewers here. This book is much more user-friendly than many similar first-person accounts, in that it doesn't assume that the reader is familiar with military ranks, anagrams, abbreviations, etc. It's also remarkably free of the braggadocio of many similar books, and Mr. Constance comes off - in the early chapters at least - as a self-deprecating wide-eyed kid who has no idea what he's actually in for.Did anyone notice that starting on page 53 of the paperback, we're introduced to Senior Chief Rudy Boesch, who would of course turn out to be the cantakerous Rudy from the reality-TV show ""Survivor???"" (Who, as I recall, was blasted by his island teammates for not being able to start a fire despite his 42 years as a SEAL!)."
3,Interesting subject -- disjointed writing,"I thought the subject matter would make for interesting reading. It could have. The book seemed to have very little cohesion from chapter to chapter. Instead, the chapters seemed to jump from one story outline to another. It was as if Mr. Constance was reciting a war story, took a break, and told another, and so on. I would have preferred a thread running throughout the entire book, not just disjointed stories (even though most of them were interesting)."
3,The Great War: Walk in Hell,"Overall a disappointing but still entertaining novel. Turtledove's strengths are character development and social commentary. He creates a broad impression of the impact of his fictional history on a divided America. Where Turtledove disappoints is capturing the true nature of military operations and the impact of emerging technology. His analysis of military topics is superficial. In short, the book is entertaining, but don't look too hard at the military interpretation of Turtledove's alternate history."
4,Hell American Style,"Harry Turtledove is a fine storyteller. Both AMERICAN FRONT and A WALK IN HELL leave me anxiously awaiting the next installment.Nevertheless, I fear that he will somehow contrive to have the Confederacy win again. This was bad enough in HOW FEW REMAIN. As a fluke, I can understand how the South would have won the Civil War in the way Turtledove depicts, but a second round with the North should have finished the CSA. Turtledove's portrayal of a second Confederate victory is absurd, but it does set up his GREAT WAR series rather nicely.The characters are not all that confusing, but I admit that I lose track of them between installments. Perhaps when they are all written, I will take the time to read it all at once."
3,Political logic lacking,"This, similar to the last book shows Turtledove's great ablity at writing multi-perspective war story. However, the political scene beyond America, is murky and confused. It is not clear who Russia, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire are allied with. Though Austria is name dropped at several points in the series it is never clear whom they side with. If Germany was allied with the USA then it would theoretically be allied with Russia instead of Austria. If so, then the Germans would be much closer to Paris.In Our Time-Line, the Turks were discive in winning the war, but in This Time Line, the Turks make no apearance. The last thing that is very fantasic is that the war starts here in exactly the same way as in OTL. With a Point of Divergence in the 1860s the world would not play out the way illustrated here."
5,Very Nice Bedding Set,This set was perfect for my son's room. The colors are bright and vivid and the comforter seems like a good quality weight. It fits his bed great. It is so hard to find something for a teenage boy's room and this just worked wonderfully.
4,I thought it did the job.,"It reviewed some pretty elementary Windows procedures, and I didn't need some of that...but then it answered the questions I had concerning differences from Windows 98 nicely. I really like the ""visually"" concept very much and it is super in that regard, too. I used it in conjunction with the XP tutorial that came already loaded with the software. For me, the book was a big time saver with easy reference of different subjects. Particularly good if you're ""spotty"" on some of your basic skills. I did think it was a little oddly organized, but everything I needed was there, and that's what counted for me. I recommend this book."
4,Good visual reference for visual people,Used this to teach a dingy hairdresser the basics of using a computer. She found the visual references extremely helpful and a good tool when I wasn't readily available to assist her.
2,"uh, why so much praise for this?","Come on, this is not a five star item. Nor are the Sex Pistols or the Dead Kennedys, because as influential as this punk rock music is it simply has no melodic appeal. There's nothing to make you say ""yeah, that's a good song"" because the music's simply there and has no impact. I only gave this item two stars because of the humorous song about brews or whatever and the fifteenth track which has a good guitar riff in the background. But otherwise, I just didn't care for it.My punk rock likes areSum 41 (not their pop stuff)The Offspringearly Green DayPennywiseDescendents!The End"
5,PunkRock Starter Kit,"As a fan of the punk/hardcore genre for over 15 years, i cannot give this record a higher review.truely groundbreaking.truely amazing.its in the top 5 of records you NEED to get if you like punk rock."
1,just noise,"Damaged isnt music. There are no songs on this album. Its just discordant, grating, noise. Like fingernails on a chalkboard. Try IN MY HEAD if you wanna hear a more mature and skillful Black Flag."
1,Disaster!,"I got the correct movie case, but it came with a blank DVD. I don't have time to be shipping things back. This was a Christmas present...how upset would you be if it didn't work when you put it in?!?!?!"
2,the examples simply suck,"This book tries its best to quickly cover every single subject about the new PHP4 to lure buyers. But regretfully fails to get into the matter deep enough to really understand what's going on. The examples that are given use huge letters and the lines wrap, which gives us some eye-shatteringly ugly code. Also, the two writers use a very different style, one uses very official language which is fine, but the other uses jokes and a more romantic kind of writingstyle, which confused me sometimes (what?? is this a joke or what??). Don't go for this one, opt for a more expensive but more valuable book if you want to get into PHP."
5,Holds the primers great,Does exactly what I thought and want it to do. It keeps the oils from my hands off the primers and gives me more confidence that every case I reload with go off at a higher rate due to cleaner primers...
5,Eyewitness has a new fan,Easy to use guide book. Very informative and relevant. I would recommend this book to the novice and to the well traveled.
4,lighthearted and entertaining,"this video will show you how to grow m. in a very simple and straightforward way. be warned, it may become tragically fuuny at times when professors begin discussing the effects of ""hallucinogenic materials"". overall, i enjoyed the sections which wavered between hydroponic and organic. which is truly better. i guess we will have to wait and see. thankyou marijuana, for curing my ailments!"
5,tastes great,"Although we don't find the cookie dough flavor in this little snack, you get the little ribbon of chocolate that makes is sweet and tasty, and you feel good at it only being 100 calories, plus having the health benefits. We want to try some other flavors too. I see there is a coffee one."
3,interesting predictions but lackluster story,"It's mostly making predictions on what wars will be like in the future and on how human society will be like in general. A lot of predictions and most of them are made kind of superficially, without developing them fully. It might have been more interesting if it picked just one such prediction and if it would have made the book just about that, in depth.As for the story and the characters, in my opinion, they are underdeveloped. Science fiction or not, that's what I look for in a book the most. Personally, I don't see what made the book so successful with other people."
4,A metaphor for Vietnam that still holds true today,"A powerful book that explores the relationship of time and the pointless futility of war. A young man sent off to fight a war against an alien foe loses time with each jump of his starship, aging days or weeks while years go by back on Earth. Each attack is planned years in advance to accommodate this and the war stretches on for centuries while only months are passing for those that fight it. A fascinating novel written during the depth of the prolonged fighting in Vietnam, the book is a metaphor for that time--but one that is still valid and insightful today. It does what the best science fiction does; it heightens and explains our current reality through the application of times, places, and technologies that are still far, far away."
4,Pretty good for an old book.,"I'll admit, I had a hard time starting this book. My suspension of disbelief kept going on and off because of how dated the first part of the book was. However after a few chapters it was easy to look past that and enjoy it for what it is... A fantastic tale of a soldier lost in time. Highly recommend it. I'm kicking myself for not reading Haldeman when I was younger."
5,Has staying power!,"An excellent read. Though a parable of Vietnam, it's commentary on the future is relevent to us in many ways. The several societal changes the protagonist witnesses might in several hundreds of years from now become realized."
2,A real disappointment,"Given the stellar reviews and awards this book has won, I was expecting something superb. It was truly average. Pedestrian. Workmanlike. Perhaps for its time, 35 years ago, it was cutting edge. But we have to judge it by the present, given the plodding nature of the writing.The author is no stylist. It came off as something written by a very talented teenager. That isn't saying a lot.Alas, most books I read, I would never read again. This one, I'm sorry I spent the time in the first place. It's not bad. It's just not what everyone led me to hope for. The bar is set too high, and so the rating must be harsher.J"
5,Rare Sci Fi,"This is science fiction the way I like it, gritty, real, and clever.The graphic novel is also superb if your a fan of that medium!Dont miss it!"
4,Good page turner,"Likable characters, easy, and fun to read what is considered a classic SF novel, which I've never tried. I read somewhere, Ridley Scott may make a movie based on the forever war. Original ideas for sure and I may have another go at another Hadelman book soon."
4,interstellar war MINUS warp drives = time puzzler,"The time dilation aspect of this book is awesome. Most sci-fi books come up with some ""warp drive"" or other propulsion system that discounts the effects of relativity. This one is centered around that very problem, with very intriguing results.Throwing some general relativity into a military story was cool enough, but then Haldeman actually manages to throw a love story into the mix as well. Very well done - as a result, I started looking for other books by Joe Haldeman, as well as similar authors (such as Robert Charles Wilson and John Scalzi)."
2,disappointed,"I read this book because of the raving reviews, the awards it received and because I am a sci-fi fan. First of all, I was very disappointed with the writing. It is a mystery to me why it got all those awards. Writing style is not compelling, some of the dialogues are plain awkward, character development is unsuccessful and overall the book feels fragmented. The author had some original and very good ideas considering it was written in the 70's, and I can understand why it was a success back then given the relevancy of the story to the Vietnam war. But, he is not a good writer and everything about the book feels out dated today."
4,Vintage Si Fi,"Loved this vintange Si Fi epic. Highly reccomend to anyone who enjoys futuristic military drama which speaks to the ""role of war"" in our own (and every society)."
4,A great ride through time.,"First, I must admit that I only delve into scifi as a subject. This book, however, was well versed in enough ""militarism"" to make it believable even within the scope of the fiction. This isn't a book so much about time travel and fighting as it is about the changes that occur over time and how we would relate to such changes. Very good read."
4,Don't read the reviews!,"I liked the book a lot. However, due to the many reviews I have read, I expected more. Probably, if I hadn't read the reviews praising the book, I'd have liked it even more. Don't get me wrong, the book is very good! But I was expecting something fantastic, so it felt less than it really is. And read it to the very end, the final part changes everything."
2,Found it pretty boring,"I gave this book several chances, but found the writing spare to the point of drabness. There were no exiting ideas, characters, or settings."
3,It Wasn't For Me,"I have a military background and love sci-fi books so I thought this was going to be one of my favorites. While it wasn't bad I didn't finish the book caring about the characters or the war, I was just kind of glad it ended. There are other books out there that are better but this is such a quick read might as well see if you like it."
4,Fast paced action with a message ....,"Here is a tidy piece of work for all you anti-war people out there. Haldeman revisits the ultra-violent military genre and creates a fast-paced, character portrait that is worthy of the sci-fi awards it has one.This book borrows on numerous themes but is unique because of the world Haldeman creates. The loniless and futility of army life is portrayed and Haldeman is extrapolating on his own Vietnam experiences. The protagonist works his way up the military ladder by virtue of of everyone else dying and meanwhile the pointlessness of war is threatening to shatter his world.Bottom Line: Violent sci fi book that rocks the whole way through! On par with other Hugo award winners."
3,Started well but lost me,The premise is great and I had sympathy for the main character but everything seemed rushed. There was no fleshing out the story on Earth and his basic training. I did get a bit bored with the story at times. Still I did finish it but just not enough action with war being in the title.
4,Very much enjoyed the book.,I would say it is a book in the vein of Starship Troopers but quite a fun read. I couldn't put it down. If you enjoy this I would strongly suggest checking out Old Man's War by John Scalzi.
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"With so many stars and good reviews, I expected a really good story, but I was disappointed. I thought if I kept reading it might get exciting at some point, but it didn't. It also was too out of date for my taste. I guess if you bought the book and read it in the 70's you'd think differently, but I just couldn't get into it."
4,"Good, and for its time very edgy, but feels a bit dated","I enjoyed reading this years ago, and enjoyed picking it up again. It was like meeting a familiar friend. The story proceeds at a good pace, and explores interesting themesIt just felt a bit dated, moving a bit slower than current novels."
4,"Good, but yes it truly is over-hyped.","I'm not sure I've thought much about this book at all since I've read it. I think I actually have a more negative view of it in hindsight. As I recall it seemed just like the formula I heard for sf of that era i.e. Sex+bleakness=literature. Sex+bleakness can be literature, but you need more. Actually there was a little more. For example, it's got some humor & is fairly moving at times. Not enough more to justify the hype. All in all definitely not literarily great, not science fictionally great either, but above average. Interestingly that's my general feeling about Haldeman, but in Asimov's Magazine I read a poem of his I liked. Maybe he should of stuck with that instead of doing novels like this."
1,Boring,"There are very few books that I can say were not really worth my time. Sadly, this is one. The plotting is terrible, the characters are wooden, and the anti-war message quickly starts to seem relentless and wearying. The future society it proposes is so absurd that I am amazed that anyone ever thought that the book contained greatness. If I had to guess, I would say that the approval people show towards the book is really just an outgrowth of the era which produced it: the Vietnam war. It said what people at that time wanted said, and thrilled them because of that. Now it just reads like a relic of an era whose premises and hopes have clearly failed. It amazes me that people like John Scalzi, who can write a wonderfully enjoyable book, liked it. His Old Man's War is in some ways very similar. There is only one difference: it is so much better."
1,Over Rated,Boy...I believed all the stellar reviews of this book so I decided to purchase it seeing as lost material was added back in on top of it. I was glad it was under 300 pages because it had to be the most boring book I have read in a long time. I could have cared less for any of these characters. Plus the preoccupation with sex in this book was ridiculous. This book doesnt hold a candle to Heinleins Starship Troopers. Read that one instead!
1,disappointed,I received this tape and a Yani tape and neither of them work. I tried them in several places and they still did not work. I am extremely disappointed since I spend a lot at this site and have been happy in the past with books I have bought. This is my first time with CD's. I will send them back soon.
2,Good enough for novices.,"This book does a good job of showing how compilers generates applications from your source code. It does explain the pitfalls, the traps and commons mistakes in c++ but only gives the most obvious ones. It is a good entry book for novices but for the others their are better manual out there."
1,Where is the EDITORIAL REVIVEW ?,Why is there NO EDITORIAL REVIVEW for this book? How can a potential customer who is searching Amazon.com knows what this book covers? It is such a waste when the authors or publishing company spent a lot of money to develop the book but forgot to write an Editorial Review when posted it on the net!
1,Factory Defect....Look Elsewhere,"my JVC HRXVC15S arrived with a factory defect--a LOUD 60cycle hum via the VHS side. i called VANNS, the seller, and they said call JVC (never going to buy anything from VANNS again...), called JVC and described the problem, they asked a couple of questions that makes me believe that the problem is a known defect, tell me to ship it to them and, no, they don't pay the shpping. so.......never by another JVC product again....so, i'll try and sell the thing as a DVD player (no hum from that side) for $25 and shop for another (non-JVC) unit."
2,Don't get this if you need an S-Video output.,I got this to transfer VHS to DVD. I was going to use S-Video output for the video portion. Despite the specs on this website indicating that there is one there is no such output jack. I'm thinking of returning it.
1,Mao,"This is an exceedingly poorly designed mailbox. The bottom has 4 large holes (1.5 inch diameter) and 6 smaller holes (0.75 inch diameter. I suppose the holes are there to allow critters such as spiders and mice to easily access the mailbox for their homes. The front door has large raised ""U.S. Mail"" letters and a large raised eagle symbol that destroys a smooth surface for posting self-adhesive mailbox numbers over practically the entire front of the door. There is a small, one inch space at the bottom of the door for numbers but no where near enough space for a standard 2 inch number or letter. Too bad the dimwitted Fulton engineers who designed this crap were incapable of seeing the problems with such a design. Bottom line is this...do NOT walk away from this mailbox....RUN !!!!"
5,Excellent Technique Builder,"I am a professional guitar teacher and performer. The four warmups in here are excellent, and the ""workouts"" themselves are also excellent. This book helped me break alot of new ground in my technique, and through the excercises develop, as jodi refers to it, a more balanced set of hands. I started with this book four years ago and revisit it often, and use the warmups religiously before gigs.Being originally a drummer by education, a guitarist would compare the chromatic excercises in this book to ""rudiments"", as they often force you to perform unusual position shifts and picking/ finger combinations. The ""Chordiac"" workouts, (chord drills) are the 2nd part of each workout and are also excellent, each one building upon the last and opening up new harmonic ground on the instrument. This book has and still helps me eliminate technical and musical learning gaps in my playing."
5,Great movie,"I READ THE DIARY FOR SCHOOL AND I LIKED IT, THEN THE MOVIE CAME OUT AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD. THE END WAS SAD BUT IT WAS TRUE. THE MOVIE WAS GREAT AND I RECOMEND U BUY THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS EXTRORDANARY!"
5,inspiring movie,"I think this movie was very inspiring. I wish I had the guts that the actors and actresses of this movie had. The young lady who played Anne was so convincing I caught myself thinking she was really Anne. I was really pulled into this movie and touched by it from beginning to end. I am a teacher for students with learning disabilities, this movie was a nice match to my version of the book (I edited the book for time purposes). The students were able to understand the book better because they were able to see it on tv and not just listen. Of course I did have to edit some scences in the concentration camp. It would have been helpful if the abstract by the company would mention the section of nudity in the movie. Thankfully I had read a previous review and watched the movie first."
5,This movie is touching,"This video is amazing.You almost feel you are there.Feeeling the pain and sadness she went through,the feeling that you will die wishing it was not true but it is and you are in hitlers cluches."
4,Paul was pretty good.,"I wanted to give this 3.5 stars (but have to round it up to 4) if Diana Krall's Live in Paris is a 5. It is an entertaining show but not a first class production like fellow Canadian, Diana's. I enjoy Paul's energy in performance and his talent in song writing. Moreover, I get to show my teenage kids that the ""old"" songs can be cool especially performed in a jazz format. After a few interactions between Paul and the audience my younger son turned to me and asked if the DVD was rated PG-13. You will know what I mean when you watch it.Well, before I bought this DVD I was looking for a review here in Amazon since I know nothing about this show. But I got none and took a chance. I got lucky. Usually after reading a few different reviews from Amazon I get an idea of what to expect. Hope this gives you a hint."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!!!,"Draper is incredibly egotistical and so blinded by her own accolades that she is incapable of empathizing with or truly capturing the experiences of anyone other than herself. She is ignorant of the potential of special education students promulgating that they will ""never become doctors or lawyers""(p.96). She ended the book with an excerpt of another book she had previously written! Not enough people buying your books?! She trampled all over the experiences of others and stroked her ego until the very end. She is wordy and her writing is mediocre. Absolutely dreadful!!!"
2,The conflict of cultures,"I did not like the girl or the guy. The guy was while at times tender was arrogant in expecting her to make all the changes and got annoyed when she misunderstood on some culture aspects. I agree with a previous reviewer about the ""link"" that it feels wrong.-spoiler-a link is when a second male connects with the female's mind at her peak orgasm. The can have intercourse or not but he must be in skin contact with the female. Then when later meet they greet by kissing each other with mild passion (tongue action). I found that distasteful, i prefer for the full ménage; they are only with each other and no one else (no contact with another). Supposedly since they are telepathic race the link is to provide protection for the feamale' mind.ProsThe male was tender at times and highly sexual who honestly cared for his packmate. The female did in the end accept and love the male and try to understand the different culture."
3,THE REVIEW I WISH I HAD READ BEFORE BUYING,Okay there are two versions of this cd.The first one is from '94 which not only has the live recordings of ANIMAL and JEREMY but also of Daughter that ends with an excerpt from Pink Floyd's song: Another Brick In The Wall.The second is the US updated version of the much more expensive import from '95 (That being this one). DAUGHTER is not included.What really got me pissed off was that I had no idea that the live recordings were actually taken from the well known '94 FOX THEATER CONCERT. My point is that the sound recording for that concert were horrible. I know this because the single for DAUGHTER includes a live version of YEllOW LEDBETTER that is for more superior in sound quality and it was taken from a '93 concert in Arizona.I gave it three stars because of the great performance from Pearl Jam on the three tracks.
2,Don't buy this,"Buy his ""Old Five and Dimers"" album. It is so great. Real songs sung from the heart. Old Five and Dimers (is great).This album, on the other hand, is watered down. Someone said to him, ""Hey Billy Joe, we can sell a lot of your albums if we clean up your sound and make you sound (weak)."" And Billy Joe said, ""Where do I sign?"""
2,5 Canadian brothers runa way from their abusive drunk of a father,"When Shawn turns 18, he decides his vicious drunk father's had enough chances to kill his children, and takes the whole family on the run. But life on the road is hard, especially given the tensions between calculating, amoral Rick and the rest of the siblings."
1,'OK' type product. Not that great,"This product is just OK type. Nothing so great about it. Initial setup is hard. I had to roll back to factory settings many times to bring this item to working stage.After one month of usage, the signal stength started fluctuating randomly. Most irritating problem I found was with the netgearwireless adapter itself. it stops working if the computer was started from hibernation ( I usually do that way). To make adapter to work, you need to remove and insert back. Does that not suck?."
1,Not worth the reading. 8th grade reading level.,"I was extremely disappointed. He had a great story and plot. But Patterson was extremely boring with those love scenes. WHO CARES about Alex Cross' love life. If I wanted to read a love story I would buy a Jackie Collins' sleazy novel. Patterson also rambled on and on with descriptions of the elements. Again, not suitable for a suspense novel.I believe his best work is still Kiss the Girls. Come on Patterson, we know you can do it. Please write another great thriller like Kiss the Girls and leave out Dr. Cross' stupid family and love life.MCP"
1,lame crime novelloses steam after soneji leaves,This novel was advertised as the return of the Spider Gary Soneji. It is a reasonably good book when he is on stage but his story is interconnected with a less interesting killer named Mr Smith. When Soneji dies the Smith character takescenter stage and the book falls apart. Smith is not interesting his real idenityis revealed too early andthe graphic violence is at times over the top. This book is not interesting at all in the second half and the firsat half was merely ok I didnt find Cross or the other recurring c haracters compelling this time around. In my opinion this is the worst of the Alex Cross novels
5,The best serial killer book ever!,"I've read them all...all the serial killer books and this book is the best I've ever read! This book moves at an exciting pace. It's chapters are short, so short.. that nothing boring can be injected.Don't buy this book if you like the theater, if you think guns should be outlawed, or-if your boring, but you just don't know it. This book is fun, violent,gory and very very easy to read!!!"
1,Don't waste you time with this one!,"One of the worst books I ever read (recycled it just before finishing the last page)! A book's quality can be determined by comparing it with other similar books. If you thought this book was good, please read the much superior ""Headhunter"" or ""Ripper"" by Michael Slade to see the difference."
4,"Although a bit anti-climactic, still a fun read!","What distinguishes this book from Patterson's others is its anti-climactic ending. Patterson does a nice of job of instilling suspense in the reader and even throws in a few surprises, but when Cross solves the cases (doesn't he always?), the reader is left thinking, ""That's it?"" This book was still a fun read, though, and a page-turner. Good beach reading."
5,page turner and completly breath taking,Fantastic and I just cant wait til the next installment of Dr Cross. Just cant imagine what was going to happen next.
4,Read in Three Days..,"This book was so good I could not put it down. Patterson brings to this book some unexpected twists to the story. Just when Cross thinks Gary Soneji is gone, he reappears. With another killer on the loose the pressure is on! If you are reading the Alex Cross Series, this book fits perfectly in the series.. I highly recommend this book. It was a quick read. So have another book ready!"
4,A Great Hunt,"I found this book to be engrossing and exciting, a real pageturner. James Patterson keeps his action short (in chapters), but effective. The blending and crossover of stories and characters was extemely well done, never losing the thread of the plot, and never having the reader saying, ""What's happening here?"" Highly recommended for anyone who likes fast-paced, physcological thriller fiction."
4,Exciting read yet somewhat anti-climactic,"Alex Cross is one of my favorite characters when it comes to series books like Patterson's ""Along Came a Spider"",""Kiss the Girls"", and ""Cat & Mouse."" It's rare that a reader finds a heroic, intellectual African-American protagonist in these types of best selling thrillers. However as much depth and rewarding character development he's given Cross, he spoils his latest installment ""Cat & Mouse"" with a somewhat anti-climactic resolve. Don't get me wrong, the story is riddled with clever plot twists and unstoppable pacing. Perhaps ironically, these Patterson trademarks are what left me hoping for more."
4,He's back!,"Just when you think you've got it all figured out, Patterson throws in another twist. A previous killer, Gary Soneji, is back, along with a killer who is terrorizing Europe. The chase is on, and as always, James Patterson carries it off and leaves you wanting more. Patterson doesn't tie up the end of every book with a nice neat bow, and you never know when a killer is going to show up again. So far, the Alex Cross series shows no sign of slowing down."
2,Disappointing,"This is the first novel by this author I have read, and it will probably be the last. The characters are so flat and cardboard-ish that I stopped caring about what happened to them. There were some good plot twists, but the book feels overloaded; two parallel plot lines are one too much.The idea of near-superhuman villains worked in novels like 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs' because of the very good writing skills of their author; Patterson does not have these skills, and the super-villains in this book feel as silly as the villains in a James Bond film. Since Patterson's previous books have received good reviews assume this book was a 'pot-boiler' written in haste, or written during a period of blocked creativity."
5,one of the best patterson books!,"Cat and Mouse is a heart-racing book you won't want to put down, and it will have you continually questioning just who is the cat and who is the mouse. Mr. Smith, Cross's psychopathic murdering rival, surpasses Soneji in his cruelty and intelligence and shocks even the avid Patterson reader. Surprises too are in store in this novel as Patterson is known for. I enjoyed every minute reading this book -- it made an 11-hour flight seem much shorter. Read it!"
4,"muy buen cd, pero...","El rollo con Les Luthiers es que algunas de sus obras me fascinan y otras no me acaban de convencer, de este disco, la única rola que realmente me tuerce de risa el ""la bella y graciosa moza"", las otras también son buenas, pero no tanto..."
4,hayden classic,Hayden classical music that does not disappoint.Sonically excellent performance is wonderful.Light non tiring almost ethereal performance.this is a must have for any collection .
2,Adjustable Floor Mirror,The adjustable pole that attaches to the mirror is very weak and flimsy. The base is not very heavy. The screws around the mirror keep coming loose so they have to be tightened often to keep the mirror from moving.
5,mirror,"This was a gift for my mom who had one similar, which got the mirror broken. She just loved the gift, it was nicer than her old one, with a strong, heavy base so it wouldn't ""tip over"""
4,School/Teaching,This product was a very smart purchase; one that I am planning to use more than once. It is a very valuable way to teach others to read and shows the value of the skill of reading.
4,Interesting with a few problems,Interesting characters and mystery. I would prefer not to see illegal drug use treated so casually. It threw me out of the story every time.
4,American Eden,Another fine novel by Marilyn Harris. All of her Eden series books are a delight to read!
1,Photoshop Elements 2 Special Effects has defects,"I cannot find the project files on the CD-Rom as noted on the books cover. I sent an email to Wiley asking them what the hell was going on and waiting for a reply. I'm not happy with the book so far. At least as far as the projects are concerned. Tried to go to the author's web site, but, you have to pay in order to ask him anything."
4,Fun Game,"I bought this game for my teenager for Christmas. He absolutely loves this game. Now I can't get my husband away from it either! What I like is there isn't the gore, swearing, etc. in other kinds of games like this. Although the characters say the same thing over and over which gets a bit annoying. But like I said, a really good game."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent read! All of our children enjoyed the story...it's very gripping and keeps even the youngest focused. The author definitely has a gift for writing. Highly recommend. We haven't read the other books in the series, so I'm not sure if they would be as highly recommended."
5,My kids loved every minute of it,"We read this for Advent this past year (2010). My kids, age 8 and 5, just loved it. Every day, when we got to the end of a chapter, they would and sigh and ask if could we read more. I think it really brought the whole Adevent story alive for them. We had done others things for Advent in the past but my kids enjoyed this the most. My kids were ok with it but there are some scary parts if you have a particularly timid younger child.. I would highly recommend this book !"
2,Not suitable for young children,I had heard a lot of good reviews and enthusiasm for this story. I really like the concept of reading a small portion of the story each day during advent. But when I pre read the story before reading it to my children (8 and 5 y.o.) I was very surprised at the scariness and violence in it. I know my children would have nightmares if we read this before bed and even I was scared! I also found the Christian application a little corny at times and random in its nature. I ended up selling the book without reading it to my children.
5,Durango Indian Paint Horse,Love the painted pony horse Durango--he is very soft and cuddly. I also purchased the book My Chincoteague Pony by Susan Jeffers and they match up perfectly!
2,"with poor pix, this is too much","I was astonished with poor quality of BW pictures this book contains. And I paid $50 for this? The photos are poorly lit so the details are not clear, and not sharp enough for this kind of printing. Texts are rather sketchy too. Intrestingly, resources contain a section for books on presentation models. I found most of them are out of print.I can just imagine this book's innitial run was so low that gave this hefty price tag to this book.Unless you have a lot of money to waste, or you're advanced, you'll be surprised like me."
2,"tiny pictures, and a tad esoteric","I found it interesting, but I don't really understand who this is geared towards. I guess the main idea of this book was that the model is a design tool? I had heard the second edition was focusing more on digital fabrication and the like, but it really just mentions a couple processes, and a few contemporary designers using models. The processes could definitely be described better, this is not really a how to book, but it does touch on a few points. Pictures are pretty tiny and a little blurry."
1,VERY Disappointed,"I purchased these for table decoration at a picnic themed luncheon. As nice as the picture looks showing well defined ants, the actual product were not well molded and actually looked like spiders. Instead of being the cute icing on the cake of my theme, they creeped everyone out! I'm great for repurposing things I purchase, these went in the garbage."
5,Wonderful reminder of what Hawaii was like at the times.,"Having lived from the 40s to the present in Hawaii, this made me remember what it was really like then. Remember the dock strikes and the racial prejudices? A must for Hawaii history buffs."
2,Sights Are Old,I got these expecting I would be getting some freshly made sights at least in the 2011 range. These sights last about 12 years(half life) and when these arrived I immediately look at the package and to my dismay they were made almost 5 years ago (2008)! Not a good deal. Besides the fact that amazon probably got these cheap and charged full wholesale they are still well built sights.
2,Tape Storage Needs Cover,"I have hundreds of mini dv tapes and during certain sports seasons, I add two to three tapes each week. Thus, a mini dv storage rack sounded like a great idea. In fact, I purchased several of these racks because I wanted to organize my tapes. The problem with the racks is that there is no cover to keep the tapes from falling out of the rack. If I had to do it again, I would purchase a mind dv tape rack with a clear cover attached on top."
4,it is what it is,"It's not some crazy contraption, just holds the tapes. I thought the price was very steep, and it might be still, but the construction is VERY solid. Shipping was faster than indicated, which was a pleasant surprise. I would buy this again... if I could afford it."
4,Fantastic recipes/bad typist,"This book has the most fabulous,genuine ethnic specialties, and it is a real window into the heart and soul of these cultures that inhabit Brooklyn. Make sure that the book you purchase is a second edition or later, at least that is the word."
1,THIS BOOK IS TRASH,"This book is the biggest piece of literary trash I have seen in a long time. It is a collection of peace-mongering propaganda that seems to take issue with political reality as much as the author does in her own life. The agendas in her poems spoil the spirit of the pieces and make the reader resent the author. The poems are rather sophomoric at best, and are poorly written. Most of them make no sense; you would have to be inside Ms. Walker's head to comprehend her contorted style. It appears that Ms. Walker should re-enroll in a college level poetry class. THIS BOOK IS TRASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK--I TOOK MY COPY BACK AFTER 24 HOURS."
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this toothpaste randomly, at a natural health website, I needed something to put me in the ""free"" shipping range and this was it. My mouth felt clean and my gums refreshed. I would reccoment this paste for someone who is looking for an alternative to popular brands."
5,I love this cd,I love this cd. It's great to listen to at work. I was worried with the warning label but it's not bad at all. There are several drug references and that is it.
3,3 Stars For The 4 Good Songs,"You know the ones...""High"", ""You're Beautiful"", ""Wisemen"", and ""Tears and Rain"". I appreciate the lyrics on some of the others, but just a little too much whining for me. But those 4 songs are great; I bought the CD for 1 song really, so I came out ahead. His next album will be better, no doubt about that. Def. someone to watch..."
2,boring,"Great idea it was to get back at an old girlfriend by selling her memory, but did you have to get back at listeners with a pretty boring set of unmemorable songs?Endless. Maybe I'll leave this disc on the subway."
1,Television incision on the frontal lobe.,"Negative charisma: yup, this guy actually sucks any ambient charisma out of the room, and probably the surrounding town as well. Whenever the advert for this comes on the telly (about every 30 seconds - a sure sign that something's wrong) I have to plug and unplug my ears rapidly whilst humming and gargling as loudly as possible to prevent my brain from being sucked into the telly and rearranged forever. Terrifying. Whoever called this genre ""power ballads"" was obviously a previous victim."
4,"james blunt, the lyrics make up for the voice","I will admit i'm not the biggest fan of james blunt, mainly because i didn't really like his voice, but i do think that everything else in his music makes up for it, the same way when i listen to singers like michael bolton who doesn't have the best voice either compared to the smooth clean voices of a boy band like the backstreet boys. but the lyrics which he writes with passion all make james blunt a true star.I love his song ""your beautiful"", some of the lyrics in his songs are sad like ""goodbye my lover"", I'm not the biggest fan of sad songs either but they sure have their place in music of course as with all other emotions in life, this is a good cd to listen to on a lazy sunday or chilling out on a late night"
1,Disgusting Pop Swill,"The lyrics quite literally could have been and sound as if they were written by a love-smitten 13 year old. I suppose, however, that as long as love is a concept that hits home, there will inevitabley be ""artists"" like this, monopolizing on it with their own pathetic 10 tracks of heart-wrenching ""bedlam."" If you often describe your musical taste as ""generic"" or ""simple,"" this is unequivocally for you."
2,Back to Bedlam,"I'm going to make this short; the tunes are catchy, but extremely repetitive. Listen to You're Beautiful. You'll hear the same guitar chord played over and over again in the background. Also, the lyrics are quite odd."
2,Not my thing.,"I agree with the other reviewers that find his voice annoying. I hate that he yodels the last syllable of EVERY word. Just because you CAN do that doesn't mean that you should. I have no problem with men singing in high voices. Dexter Holland of the Offspring, Michael Jackson (Don't laugh at me), Freddy Mercury, and Ozzy (back in the day at least) have high male voices...but they don't sound like THIS. I'm even partial to Colin Meloy of The Decemberists. ""Weird Al"" Yankovic (another high-voiced singer) did a much better version of one of these songs called ""You're Pitiful"". I highly recommend you check it out. My two-star rating is based only on the simple acoustic instrumentation (which I enjoy)."
4,FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE PORTEND A BIG FUTURE,"His Gibb-ian voice and spiritual, folksy yet leading- edge lyrics are different, and that in itself is refreshing in our pre-packaged world.In a world full or Denny's, James Blunt is an interesting independent diner. And because he writes his own stuff, I look for bigger and better as he matures.Because his voice can be a bit a wirey, I'd like hear him do some duets."
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...a unique voice that fits perfectly with his big hit song ""You're Beautiful,"" but alas, the formula is repeated too much. A nice listen, but no masterpiece."
3,Buyer Beware.,"If you're not into hearing f word in Your Beautiful don't get it. I was shocked when I heard it, I know when I bought that had explict lyrics but I didn't know the extent. Oh just a couple of minor cursing that wasn't the case. I like James Blunt, he's good singer but he does not need to add such horrible words in his music."
3,Be aware,"This looks like a great resource, and we will continue to use it. I recommend you look over the material first. Be aware that the introduction includes the phrase, ""They remembered how Jesus had been created by God in a special way inside Mary...."" I do not think this was intentionally heretical, but one should be careful when speaking about Jesus, who was not created in any way whatsoever."
3,Running something that's in the ground into the ground.,"A very clever way to sell books, I must say. Taking a highly visible piece of art/detritus and magnifying it on a plate of steaming hotcakes where everything is simple as the syrup that drips over the side is poor taste. I found some interesting pieces of thought in the Scarecrow chapter other than that, he's reaching."
5,Instant Relief!!!,"I researched and asked around for the last few days about good support belts. I'm currently 27 weeks and for the last 2 weeks or so have been suffering from both back pain and low abdominal pressure. I decided to go to a store to try some on and see what worked for me. I wasn't thinking I would like this because it looks too bulky and as though it would irritate me but the second I put it on it felt great! I bought it from Motherhood Maternity for $38. So far it's completely taken away the back pain and almost all of the abdominal pressure. I also don't use the top strap, not sure that's necessary.It is annoying to take it off to go to the bathroom, but I imagine I would have to do that with any other band. Seems like it could get itchy or scratchy if worn directly on the skin but I just wear it over my secret fit belly from my maternity pants and that works out great. Plus you can't notice it being worn under your clothes."
3,"enjoyable and fresh, but not so new","i bought this cd after i listened to one of the tunes on the radio: really good musicians, a particular voice (very ""african"") and a bright sound.it features guitar and voice (only on some titles), bass and drums.after listening to all the cd i can confirm the impression about the musicians and the sound, but the music is quite similar from one piece to another. where the voice adds to the instruments it gives an originals taste, while on some other titles it seems to listen to some kind of soft ""fusion"" music, extremely well played but not particularly original."
5,Platronics Headset,I bought this for the IT in for our company. We have purchased this before and have always be very happy with our purchase.
3,Movie,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but it was entertaining enough. The ""burrowers"" were unexplained, so that left me a little put off from the story. I liked the characters and it was written well enough. It kept going, so there was rare slow spots. The ending wasn't bad. I would say it was an okay movie, not really a horror in my opinion. The price was right and I enjoyed it enough to not give a bad review."
2,NOT closed captioned!,We were very disappointed this wasnt closed captioned like it indicates it is. Many people depend on this information when choosing movies!
2,Waste of talent and a good idea,"This movie had so much potential but lost it somewhere along the way, it just meander into the woods, never to return. The ending was almost an afterthought. It genuinely seemed like the director looked at his/her watch and told the crew to wrap it up.There are two reasons why I gave it two stars instead of one: 1) the creatures were well done. While they never had me jumping in fear, they were pretty cool for B movie monsters. 2) It was fun spotting familiar actors.Unfortunately, neither of those two compensate for a badly written movie."
4,Good Movie,"I've read quite a few of the reviews about this movie, but they all seem to overlook the basic premise. This is a retelling of the classic vampire tale, or a movie that provides the historical basis for the creature that would become the vampire of legend.It is a good movie, and I'm surprised that it didn't get a theatrical release. It is well acted, well written, and filmed in beautiful settings. I hope it gets more exposure."
3,coded arms,"i find that this games controls are a bit hard to master, the game it self is fun, but the controls take time to get used to."
4,"Great pillow, but different color than pictured","My son loves his new neck pillow, however I was surprised to see when I received it that it was blue and not the cream and brown pictured."
4,No Horse'in Around,"I bought this item for my daughter and her first plane trip and she just loved it. It arrived way before schedule and it was packaged nicely. The item doesn't look cheap and it was soft to keep her comfortable on the trip. If you have a horse lover, this would be a nice gift."
3,Color not represented right,"The pillow itself is fine, but it is yellow instead of orange as the picture represents. Since my daughter's favorite color is orange, she chose this particular pillow and we were both disappointed to open the box and find a yellow giraffe instead. I would recommend the pillows themselves, but the picture of the giraffe does not correctly represent the color of that pillow."
2,Not good enough,"I was very excited to find this product and read all the reviews. My daughter loves her little pillow, but it does not do the job. First, it sits little weird around her neck, pushing her head a little forward. Because of that, while asleep, her head starts popping in the front."
3,Not big enough,Cute neck pillow. Nice fabric. Bought it for my daughter who is eight and it is not really big enough. Would be better for a four year old.
4,very nice,These are very nice and high quality sheets. They feel like a higher thread count. The butter color is a little closer to an easter yellow... a little different than what is shown.
5,The Best Wedding planner ever,This Wedding binder was the best. It seriously kept me organized which is extremely difficult when planning a wedding. I don't understand why it is currently unavailable and it's too bad. I was hoping to buy it for a friend. Definitely worth searching for!
4,Better than typical manuals,Great Book. This book was written specifically about the supra. It is not one of these manuals with generic cut & pastes that have just been forced into a book. These guys really worked on a Supra. I will seek out Haynes books for future projects.
1,Shearling pillow too thick and hard as a rock,"This neck cushion sounded good, and I liked the fact that it has a strap that goes over the headrest to secure it. Unfortunately, it is useless for me. It's way too thick and hard, and is not adjustable, so it forces my neck forward. I thought it would feel like a pillow, or be made of memory foam, but there is no give to it at all."
5,look past the initial premise...,"this series was hampered by it's initial premise. most people probably looked at the whole 70s/swinger thing and kept on going...but those people missed out on one of the best written and wonderfully acted series in quite some time.if you are looking for a (sadly) short-term commitment - and want something that's better than your average joe tv show, please check out swingtown."
1,"Worked properly 7 months, then failures","This router worked fine for 7 months. Then it would consistently fail when the room temperature exceed around 85 degrees F. Many customer service calls, experiments as they directed, and two replacements failed to resolve the problem. The second replacement worked for a few days, but before the weather got warm enough to tell if it also had the problem, this router died completely, taking the power supply down with it. I finally gave up, and am extremely disappointed. Netopia would not consider a refund. So far, my replacement Linksys is working fairly well, though the interface is awkward, their utility is Windows only, and the router web interface works perhaps 1/3 of the time."
4,Wilton Cake Topper,"I was pleased with the cake topper, but surprised it didn't arrive in it's own box. It was shipped in the plastic covering that would have been inside the box."
2,I didn't like it,"I really didn't like the taste of this tea. I am not sure it did anything for my stomach troubles either. I had read the reviews with folks saying the taste was off putting, but I was desperate for relief. So I tried it and lesson learned. I should really pay attention to other reviewers!"
2,Blows the circuit on my house,"For the minute the washer works, it's great. Then it overloads my electric circuit and dies. I run downstairs, reset the circuit a few times, and then decide it must be returned. I'm looking into a gas powered unit now."
3,The sound of Norway,"I bought this for my wife, because she was born in Oslo. Hoping the music and video would bring some of her home into ours. The music is super, but the video lacks scenery, they spent to much time in close up shots of rigging on boats. and door knobs on buildings."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Young and randy again.A very wealthy business type undergoes an experimental procedure to rejuvenate his body. One of the benefits of being such a rich guy is queue position.It then explores how the people around him react, from his attractive financial planners, to his family.The other notable fact about him is that he was behind the technology that replaced the internet - basically putting all creative works, as well as information, in one competing pool, so everything is accessible.This of course kills plenty of business models and not a few careers. Bit of commentary by Hamilton there as a side issue.Not as good as his others, but decent enough.A 3.25 perhaps.3.5 out of 5"
4,Workmanlike.,"In some senses a sad fable set in a similar universe as Hamilton's earlier Mindstorm/Nanoflower books, this almost Faustian tale of a man bring given his youth veers from wild descriptions of exactly what a non-Viagra enhanced 20- going on 80 year old man can get up to when the flesh as well as the spirit is willing, to a damning indictment of the future of the European union project, especially as visions of seccession of England from the EU are raised.Less turgid than his Reality Disfunction, Hamilton manages to return to his roots and deliver a great story in a single book. Though some of its scenes will no doubt be be considered by some as voyeuristic, the plot has some deeply thought provoking moments."
2,Useful but Lacking,Key to Space was a text recently used in a graduate course and it does provide a rapid overview of various aspects of space activity flowing from each chapter. Yet it is lacking a bond to the reader to want to pick it up. It makes a contribution to knowledge of space activities but it could be done in a more alluring means. A few color photographs would have even helped hold the reader to the text. I would not purchase it but for required course material. In a word: 'dry.'
2,Overated,One of the most overated comedies in recent movie history. Save your money on this DVD. Even at the discounted price I payed it was a waste of money.
1,indescribably bad,"When a grown man, a father to boot, sees fit to leave an infant alone in a car, that is when I turn the movie off. I found the scenes with the baby so upsetting that I couldn't bear to continue watching. That people can find this film ""funny"" makes me understand why Americans are perceived as uncouth slobs."
1,no no no no no,can I have my money back?can I have my time back?can I have my one star back?how did this move get so over-rated???
4,"Funny, trashy comedy, nothing more","The Hangoveris another puerile comedy - nothing more, nothing less. It's certainly better than most comedies out there today. I'd give it 3.5-4 stars overall. It is funny and has some classic moments - tiger in the bathroom, the Holocaust ring, etc. Zach Galifianakis was particularly hilarious (""I didn't know they gave rings out at the Holocaust""). It also has a decent plot, as the trio attempts to find one of their missing wingmen.Unfortunately,The Hangoverfeels more like a bunch of intermittent funny jokes, rather than one hilarious rout. It's funny, but not bed-wetting or tear-inducing funny. Certainly not anotherNational Lampoon's Animal House (Widescreen Double Secret Probation Edition).At the end of the day, if you like movies likeOld School (Widescreen Unrated Edition), you'll probably loveThe Hangover. If you don't, then you won't like this movie."
1,"Funny??? Where, when, how????","Worst movie I saw in a LONG LONG TIME.... and I watched a lot!!! It was about as funny as getting the flu(real bad)....no interesting plot, stupid lines, so-so characters... very brash and disgusting... unless you think seeing someone's fat (celluloid-like) butt hanging outta their pants w/ a thong on is...FUNNY???...hahaha..I forgot to laugh....I'd give minus 3 stars-if I could."
1,What a dreadful film,"That 210 people gave this movie a ""5"" makes me fear the future of this nation. The Hangover is an adult film aimed at foul-minded twelve-year-olds. Since I am neither, I lasted a half hour before I could stand no more. There was nothing in that time that was funny and not a thing that was even remotely believeable. The film was headed down a sadly predictable course toward total tastelessness, although it was darn close to that already. It doesn't matter a bit that the blu-ray picture quality was pristine because there is nothing to see. I'm only sorry I had to grant this movie one star, which it richly does not deserve."
3,The Hang Over,"I've watched this movie a couple times, and it does get better. When I first watched it, I didn't laugh as hard as everyone was saying I would. But I gave it another shot and I enjoyed it. Though it's not the funniest movie I've watched, it was very intertaining."
5,Product was great AMAZON SUCKS!,"OMG!I ordered one movie and one Wii game. Amazon sent me 2 of each. After contacting them and getting return instructions, I send my items back only to NEVER get any credit!Now they send me an e-mail to fill out a review.The left hand clearly does NOT know what the left hand is doing.RUN dont walk away, go to your local store and get whatever you need. You might pay more but the few dollars you pay will be worth thie BS!Jane"
3,MOVIE DOESN'T ADD MUCH TO PREVIEW,"The Hangover has a great premise - waking up the morning after with all kinds of evidence as to what happened the night before, but no memory - which the trailers capitalized on. But what's in the trailers is about all there is in the film. It's a great premise, but it fails to deliver, so we end up with one very predictable, very dumb movie. Which is why it's so popular. Basically, the film validates irresponsible behavior as long as you can prove that you were high. Two things I can say that are good about this film: that is one cute baby; and Bradley Cooper is a cut above the rest of the cast. Rated R for sex, drugs and language.Waitsel Smith"
2,The movie gets 5 stars....the DVD release gets 2!,"I love the movie...it makes me laugh so hard, I cackle. The problem is that I bought a DVD with zero features. I knew this was the case before I bought it...but I wanted that digital copy that is splashed on the outside of the disc. My iPod is just itching for it. Only, once you open the case, you find that the digital copy you just paid extra for is for Windows Media Player ONLY! No iTunes compatible version. BOOO Warner Brothers. Harry Potter 6 had an iTunes version. Why not this movie?!? Completely and utterly disappointed....."
5,one of the funniest movies I have ever watched,One of the funniest movies I have watched in a very long time recommend it to 18 and over crowd.
3,"silly can be funny, sometimes!","A group of silly and funny guys go to Vegas for their friend's bachelor party. An incident causes them to wake up with no memory of the previous night. It's a movie that is crazy, entertaining and sometimes stupid but it's worth the time."
2,Mexico,"Well no wonder it was so cheap, the product looks and feels cheap. Made in Mexico stamped on the back, you can feel how bad the quality of the case is and the disc isnt much better, but what do you expect for a BlackFriday deal."
1,Not Funny!,"I was told this was soooooo funny, NOT. I saw nothing funny about guys getting so drunk they couldn't remember what they did the night before. Guess this is one for the younger generation I'm just too old."
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE movie.............,"I'm only giving this one star, because I can't give it less. My wife and I watched this last night, and I am wondering what this world is coming to when people actually find humor in something as terrible as this. Has to be the worst movie I ever saw......."
1,BORING,You never find out what happened. It is like they made this movie up as they went. I don't get why so many young people like this one. Goods with Jeremy Piven was much better. This is a boring long winded story that makes no sense.
1,Forgetable.,"Hollywood can always make teenagers laugh with a good fart joke, so they do it over and over and over. Unfortunately many of us watch new movies that come out to see or hear new jokes. This flick does not deliver. It is a gross out rip-off of 'Dude Where's My Car?' which is slightly better by comparison.This movie is so forgetable that it will be completely forgotten in ten years. It will never appear on television or future DVD release; speaking of D.V.D. release, I wonder if the new Dragon Versus Dinosaur movie is out, perhaps the book by G. L. Strytler book is on sale... Wait, what was I talking about again, I forgot."
5,best movie in a long time,All the acting was so good in this movie. You go on a ride watching this. I wasnt laughing every second but it was so well written and very original.
3,"Funny, but not hilarious","Well a little while ago I saw this film,now in school kids were talking about this movie all the time and saying how funny it was so when I went to my cousin's house we decided to watch it and what a let down. My cousin thought it was hilarious and I was able to keep a straight face through a lot of the dialouge. Now your thinking that I hate this movie well I don't I did think it was pretty funny (not as funny as everyone said it would be) but it is a enjoyable film and a funny one too. So bottom line I thought it was alright and keep this in mind: THIS IS MY OPINION NOT FACT!!!!"
5,Excellent,"Excellent, I was very happy with the purchase and it was shipped quickly. Looking forward to enjoying the product for years to come."
3,VERY OVERRATED but Good.........,"This movie is not the funniest or drop dead funny like most will say, it is funny and a good film but overrated by many IMO! It is like we watched a different movie, old school is funnier and better to me. This is a good flick, but not what some crack it up to be, jumps into plot way too fast and overall just not as funny as some act. I was hardly in tears watching this flick."
4,"Mostly funny, with some great dialogue","Most of this is funny when it is supposed to be, though a few elements here and there fall flat. There is also some good dialogue, although sometimes the actors' delivery and timing could have been better.Imagine waking up in a hotel suite with a live tiger and chicken, a crying baby, bottles everywhere, a missing tooth, and a missing friend. This is what happens to the hapless goofballs who threw a bachelor party in Las Vegas just a few days before a wedding and then had no recollection of what happened on that night of heavy drinking and drug use.Not for kids, certainly, but okay for some adult laughs."
3,"Unoriginal, but off-and-on funny","Just watched this on DVD, and while I laughed several times, I felt that I've seen most of this material before. Take equal parts ""Go"" and ""Dude, Where's My Car,"" throw in a dash of ""Sideways,"" and you've got ""The Hangover."" It's certainly funny in spots, but there's too much violence for a comedy in my opinion; watching people get badly beaten, tasered, etc. is not my idea of humor."
3,Okay movie,It was enjoyable enough but I just could not get into it. I do not feel that the movie lived up to all the hype as advertised.
3,Nice Surprise,Not at all a fan of American slapstick humour I decided to give this movie max 10 mins to convince me to continue.... and to my own surprise I sat through the entire movie and chuckled frequently....It is clearly a boys movie and one to watch at a poker night with your mates... but it is clearly in the better end of the scale so your wife/girlfriend will not look quite as much down on you for enjoying this than all the Leslie Nielsen movies we boys also tend to enjoy.I score this the max a mindless movie like this can score in my world - as I want my scores between categories to be alligned. If Godfather or American Beauty are 5's this is a 3.So get a few beers ready and enjoy this little gem.
5,5 Stars,"When three friends (Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Bradley Cooper) finally come to after a raucous night of bachelor-party revelry, they find a baby in the closet and a tiger in the bathroom. But they can't seem to locate their best friend, Doug (Justin Bartha) -- who's supposed to be tying the knot. Launching a frantic search for Doug, the trio perseveres through a nasty hangover to try to make it to the church on time.check out my full review @ [...]"
5,Great Great MOVIE,"This movie is so funny, one of the best comedies I have ever seen. It will be a classic"
1,If I could give 0 stars I would,"I came into this movie expecting the years greatest hit, like so many people told me. You would need to pay me, pretty well, to see this movie again. It's like they stole they plot from ""Dude Where's My Car"" and replaced the car with a guy. The humor was extremely juvenile and repetitive.I understand it's supposed to be a funny movie, I enjoy most Will Ferrell movies for example, but this movie wasn't even funny. I can't even say it had a few funny parts, it had maybe one, two tops.I kept waiting for the ""movie of the year"" type scenes and they never came.Simply awful."
2,guilty humor,"This movie is the ""comical"" equivalent of another ""Vegas"" movie: ""Very Bad Things"". Anyone who watched that movie, and felt creepy afterward will understand the similarity. Yes, I laughed, very heartily at times, and yet I found myself ashamed at the same time. I suppose we're supposed to feel okay at the behavior of these guys because after all, they were drugged with a so-called date-rape drug, but for any film to really work,(at least for me) some of the characters need to be sympathetic. With the possible exception of Doug (Justin Bartha), who appears sparingly in the movie, these guys aren't. Now, with a movie titled ""The Hangover"", I knew not to expect Shakespeare, or even Abbott and Costello, but with so many patently offensive attempts at humor- a ""masturbating"" baby, and quite realistic-appearing fellatio during the end credits, I... well, you have to draw the line somewhere, and this movie crossed it."
1,silly,I would not recommend this movie. It is pretty bad - a bad weak story - unintelligent plot. If you have time to waste and want to see mindless action go for it.
4,Hangover,So funny to see the trouble these get into. Quite a few laughs. Enjoyed it very much. Would recommend it.
3,decent songwriting,"Colin MacIntyre's Mull Historical Society's songs tread the same musical territory as Ed Harcourt's heartfelt take on songwriting. but Mull's album contains a bit more of a twee sound...it must be a Scottish thing. there is quite a bit of talent on display here and Colin has a knack for a great melody, but this 14 song set remains underwhelimg. if it had been trimmed back to an outstanding 10 cuts, this album might have had a stronger impact. there are some shining moments here such as the tracks ""Asylum"" and ""Am I Wrong."" but overall, it's a case of a little too many ideas and not enough quality control."
3,Excellanto.. The best beanie book I have seen!!!,This is a great book. No more buying all of the different books. One book to keep updated. I will never buy another beanie book again. Hey how about a beanie buddie supplement and pillow pals. That would be the ultimate book!!
4,Great Detail.,"Anyone will tell you that one book alone can not prepare you for Microsoft Certification. And I have to agree 100%. With that said I found this book detailed(technically) in a way that other books that aim at being the only certification book you need. I started reading the books on the subject and while the language was warm and fuzzy and easily kept your attention, I really didn't get much in the way of technical detail. The examples in the All in One book helped me nail down the more complex topics like delegates and remoting that other books only lightly touched. The one negative to this book is you need some experience in order to understand it. If you lack experience then my advice would be to buy both the MSPress Study Guides and this All in One. Use the MS book to get a feel for the concepts and use the All in One to start coding examples."
4,Quite Pleasing,"Well, I hadn't been to a DM concert in sometime - let's see, since the Faith and Devotion tour (which I really liked btw - can't wait for that to go DVD) - and while there's nothing really that compares to the energy that David Gahan exudes live, in concert - Anton Corbijn does a fantastic job of getting you up close and personal with the band while still allowing you to feel the rush that the crowd feels.Great visuals - cool interviews - exellent sound - all of a wonderful performance!! If you even think you like Depeche Mode (even if you don't know Exciter) get this dvd!"
5,DEPECHE MODE is Magic,"This is my favorite band of all time, this DVD show the continue evolution of the band, the mix of the sounds is simply wonderful,the performance of the old songs combined with the exciter songs is like a travel over the time. I recomend you that buy this DVD if you never see DM live because the video and audio is espectacular."
3,Depeche Mode : One Night Obsessed With Gahan's Upper Body,"I'm so glad I bought this item used because this production is not the best I've seen from this excellent group. First of all, seeing David Gahan's nude sweaty upper body was not a pretty sight. His dancing reminds me of Andy Bell from Erasure, except that Gahan seems under the influence of something. Yes, other reviews here praise the sound and picture quality, and the camera work is good as well, but the performance and song selection is not superior to other productions such as 101. Anton Corbijn fails to capture the band members as a group, leaving Andy Fletcher, the most important member as the synth player, almost completely forgoten. The second disc was almost unnecessary. Borrow this from a friend."
2,Everthing is great on here but....,"... Dave's voice is completely shot. He is one of my favorite singers, but on this performance he was defimetly struggling vocally. There is no subtly or range and just haorse shouting. I kinow causes a strain, but on a documented show likethis it would be good to hear him sounding a little fresher. Otherwise a great concert film."
2,DM Washed Up,"Usually,I browse through amazon items and rarely write a review for a product, however,I felt compelled to write a review of One Night Of Paris after buying it. I should have known not to buy it. I watched the paper-view-special and thought maybe watching it a second time would be better,but it wasn't.I'll start of with the postive. The way the concert was shot is very nice and the visuals are very nice as well.Dave Ghan to his credit is an ultimate showman and puts alot of ""soul"" into his singing,but the guy just sounds AWFUL! Dave tries to sing out to much and it comes of like raspy whinning.Just listen. Martin sound's great but he only sings a few songs. If you want Dave Ghan at his best listen to 101 live, that's the real deal. But that's history now."
2,Better luck next time,As a long time listener of Depeche Mode I was very disappointed with the sound of the DVD. I really thought that Dave sounded like garbage. The stage show was pretty good but I couldn't get over their voices. I feel that 101 was a much better video than this one.
4,wish his voice was better.,"I saw them in New York on this tour and Dave's voice was great. Unfortunately this is not the case in this DVD. His voice is shot and monotonic. The rest of the concert it really good and if Dave's voice had been on this would have been a fabulous concert. Although Martin's rendition of ""Home"" is worth the price for me. It's the best I've ever hear him."
4,Un concierto magnifico,"Esta dentro de mi top10 de conciertos. La fuerza interpretativa de Gahan en Paris es sencillamente fabulosa. Las notas altas que marcan este concierto según mi particular visión son In Your Room y el clásico Never Let Me Down.Pongale play y volumen 10, por que no se arrepentirá."
2,Good concert but...,I play this concert after the U2 Elevation Tour 2001 expecting the same camera shots and quality of sound for Depeche Mode I expected this DVD almost finish with the good image I have. I was in Germany tour DM of 93 and was more better.
4,Excellent show and DVD.,Wow. This live show is captured with all the verve of Mode on stage and all the eloquence Anton Corbijn's lens can muster. Gahan and Co. play an electrifying and emotional set; the sound is incredible and best heard LOUD. Not much else can be said but BUY THIS.One thing though: the product description says there's some song rehearsal in some dressing room? I couldn't find it. Maybe it's a 'hidden feature.' Oh well. Lotsa bang for your buck anyway. Now they need to release a dvd of the full Devotional show... another great Corbijn film.
5,A Longtime Crazed Fan Says.....,"I followed the Exciter tour straight through (including the warm up shows), and having first seen the ppv special, then the DVD, I am so happy that I will have a constant reminder of how great their live show really is. There are, of course, a few songs they did live that don't appear on the dvd, but I'm really happy they included ""Sister of Night"" (it's incredible) which they only did a few times. Buy this DVD! If you were lucky enough to see them live, you can emerge yourself in all the great memories. If you missed them, it's not the same, but it's a great alternative."
2,I guess I like things a little more direct....,"I won't include anything about the plot because you can read that in other reviews. My problems with the book are that too many things that are central to the story are only hinted at. The creatures used for the fine hunt, for example, are never described - you only get a vague sense of what they look like. The same goes for the Aya themselves - there's never a complete physical description of them. Maybe it's just that I like a little more directness in a book, but I found that there was a lot lacking in this story related to these shortcomings."
5,This book's a winner,"Previously, I was using Elements 3 and depended on the Adobe manual. Now, after upgrading to Elements 4, I decided to look for a book. I had several criteria in mind; it had to have step-by-step examples including the example images, it had to be concise with no fluff and it had to cover all of the new features. This book exceeded my expectations.I wanted to apply the new pan and zoom effect to my slide shows and after following the book's example, I can now do it on my own.Also, I received a new digital camera for Xmas that can save images in the RAW format. This book showed me how to edit them.I'm one happy camper."
5,The Fate of Bester,"Three two prior books in this collection have been outstanding.This book is no different. It is excellent work, the only thing that may dissapoint you is the continuation from the previous books. The first two books cover the beginning of the resistance and the birth and experience of Alfred Bester.The third book starts after the Psi-Corps Civil war when Alfred is on the run. A major story-line has been skipped, but not to worry though, there are a few references to the war in this book."
3,The Best of the Psi Corps/Alfred Bester Trilogy,"Much to his credit, J. Gregory Keyes has written a swashbuckling thriller which will appeal mostly to those interested in seeing Garibaldi and Bester again. It is an intriguing look at the Psi Corps' fate following the Telepath War, set nearly a decade after the events shown during the final season of ""Babylon 5"". However, the quality of writing isn't better than what you might find in a typical ""Star Trek"" novel."
3,O.K. Repair manual....,"I personally found this manual to be a little confusing to navigate, i've read other manuals that are much easier to follow. This one will do if you are cost conscious but there other choices out there. As a really good alternative try ""How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive"" by John Muir.This isn't as nearly as technical as this manual but it will give you enough information to fix whatever needs fixin' on your Type I, II, III, or IV.-19BUG74-"
2,Not for Karmann Ghias,"I own a 1967 Karmann Ghia and my dad owns a 1968 Karmann Ghia. We are both very disappointed in this book. I did a lot of research before I bought it, and it seemed to have all the information that I needed. The wiring diagrams are weak, and it does not give any direction for rebuilding any of the components. The wiper motor went bad, and the book only said that it would be easier and cheaper to replace it. Once I opened it up it took me less than half an hour to fix, and that's including the it took my to fabricate one of the parts.This book does have a lot of good general information (torque specs, type of oil/ gear lube needed, etc.) but it is far from a full restoration guide.I have never used this book for a Beetle, but I imagine I would run into similar problems"
1,Avoid this Product,"Previously I had the Belkin Wireless G Router Model No. F5D7230-4 and had no problems with the router at all. Never had disconnect issues with the router so when I wanted to get a new router, Belkin was on the top of my list. I purchased the Belkin Wireless G Plus MIMO Router Model No. F5D9230-4 and have had nothing but problems with the router. I have spent more hours on the phone with the Belkin technical support folks than I want to count. Had the router replaced once with only slight improvement. The problem is the continued disconnect when gaming or using Skype/MSN Messenger or Yahoo Messenger. There is no difference even when I hard wire the computer to the router it will still have disconnect issues. Must be a problem within the firmware. Don't notice the problem much if you only use it to surf the internet. I am buying a new router and Belkin is not even on my shopping list."
1,Uninstalled with 600+ days remaining on license,"I went with a 2 year subscription because they forced me to upgrade (no updates to old version) and because I didn't want to deal with it yearly. Mistake.It is a memory hog. After running a virus scan, you better reboot because otherwise your other programs will be extremely slow. I dealt with that by only virus scanning monthly.I finally got so frustrated, though, with an error constantly saying my virus protection was not on. The Fix Now button forced a LiveUpdate which completes but never fixes the problem. Even uninstalling everything and reinstalling (twice) did nothing to help it. And with that virus protection failing, my Outlook program wouldn't let in new email and Internet Explorer would fail (but Mozilla Firefox worked fine).I am off to try McAfee which works fine on my work laptop. I am glad I no longer own any SYMC stock..."
4,Buy it....... BUT,"I will only put Norton on my Compaq and this years version gave me some trouble until today. Seemed the program ran alot in the backround and I only had some media player access. ANSWER for those who have it and those who will purchace.... TURN OFF the ""add-ons"" except for email anti spam, then turn on your search engines pop-up blocker. Wow do I fell better. Maybe I should have purchacedNorton AntiVirus 2007"
1,Now I remember why I quit Norton the first time...,Do not buy this software! I am just waiting until PC-cillin for 2008 is released and then I'll switch back. I can't believe how sloooooowwwwww this piece of s*$@ makes everything! I would not use this product again even if Norton was giving it away.
3,Won't Play,"Like another reviewer, I have playback problems, disc two won't play for me, disc one is fine. Amazon was nice enough to exchange my first order, but the second one was exactly as the first. My DVD player is high end, but seven years old. Never had this problem before. Must be a region problem. Otherwise, this series is great."
3,Useful and fun,"The only reason I gave anything less than 5 stars on all of the questions is because the FLY pen we have hasn't been very durable. But the concept and the refill tablets have been great, worked as they are supposed to and are challenging enough to be educational but still fun."
3,Not what i expecteded,I really miss Yugi and his friends. The good thing about this game is all the new cards it has. I didn't like the opponents at all. I got a weak deck and is kinda hard the beat the rookies. Not really recommended.
2,Illustrations ruin the story,"This was an interesting story, as it varies from the fictionalized ""Sound of Music"". The illustrations, however, were disappointed and distracting - they cartoon versions of the main characters are accompanied by a variety of inanimate objects with eyes. Worse, the characters are sometimes joined by an animated musical note that dances along next to the family."
4,EASY READING. VERY INSIGHTFUL.,"A thoroughly enjoyable book! I gained new insight into East Asian Confucian values and, in particular, how those values contrast to Western ideals in relation to education, business, and society in general. I purchased this book to supplement my current studies of the Toyota Production System (Lean Manufacturing) and its on-going implementation in Western companies. The chapters which dealt with the Japanese education system, NKK's ""reinvention"" of itself, and annual Japanese national holidays specifically designed to promote group unity and cooperation, were particularly informative. Read this book if you've heard the term ""the Asian Century"" and wondered what the experts are talking about. My only criticism (if you can call it that), is that the book is only 249 pages long. I wish that the author had provided more depth to the subjects covered. In that regard, I look forward to the sequel...""Confucius Lives Next Door-II""."
4,obscure but interesting,"The celebrities are not all well know, but the book is fun. More information on the personalities would have been welcome. The photos are well done and are colorful, and the scarves are interesting. For example, the scarves are knit with very basic knitting skills, but that's the beauty: anyone can knit an awesome, personal, quirky or traditional scarf by using basic skills and choosing beautiful yarn with texture and color or by combining yarns of different weight and texture and knitting with two together, or by whipping up a leftover scarf with all kinds of variety...Scarves are always on the fashion horizon in one form or another. The book is fun for inspiration and ideas that won't overwhelm a beginner and will inspire all. Sometimes knitting without thinking (or trying to follow a pattern) is the best kind of knitting there is! Inspires me to make a whole collection of scarves."
4,amazing remover,"I removed many, many layers of paint from 130 year old stair ballusters with one application of the product. Don't be stingy with the application - goop the stripper on heavy and it will peelaway all of the paint in one try. It left the original finish exposed almost like new. When I tried to be conservative and didn't use enough stripper, it left areas that needed sanding."
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this to strip lead paint off the columns on the porch of a 100 year old house. It didn't strip more that one layer of paint, and generally was very messy to work with. I ended up using a heat gun."
3,If I only knew.......,About 100 pages in I realized that I could have gained a lot of insight about the world presented in this had I read the The Civil War Series and the Great War Series.This book presents short looks at people lives and how the war from the previous series has effected their lives. In that way I think the book is great as it shows how political decisions effect those people's lives. I did think the book lacked an over all story. I understand that the book is part of a series but even one book in a series must stand on it's own in someway.
4,Does what it is suppose to do,"I had searched for a flat iron for what seemed like months, trying to find a good quality one for a reasonable price. Which it amazes me how much these things cost. Anyway, I am pleased with the product. It straightens my natural curly hair with little effort and it does get hot enough, the only issue is the automatic shutoff, don't get me wrong, I do appreciate the saftey factor of this idea, but the iron always cuts off right before I get ready to use it. I guess I am just used to other products that take a long time to heat up. It is really just something I have to get used to! Otherwise, I am very pleased with the product."
5,A Bicycle Built for Murder,"I just read the previous review from Eleanor Warder and I totally disagree. I am a computer programmer analyst and consider myself quite smart, but I didn't find the clues easy at all. And I don't think the book was fluffy. Ms. Kingsbury has built a reputation of writing cozies, and this book only enhances that reputation. I think the characters were strong, Ms Kingsbury strong point, as proven in her previous series, The Pennyfoot Hotel Mysteries. And the clues are not as easy as Ms Warder thinks they are. Maybe they are to her, but to the average reader, I think not. This is a delightful book, well entertaining, and I would rate it very highly and recommend it to all of my friends. It kept me guessing until the end who the murderer was, and I think it did to most people. Kudos to Ms Kingsbury for yet another wonderful start to another wonderful series. I can wait for the next one to come out."
2,One of the Best,"Engaging, erudite, comprehensive, precise. Easily the best analysis of the status quo in investment theory and practice.However.The basic conclusion is this: IF you manage to live in a country with a stable legal, social, and political regime for 40 years, THEN during that period stocks will be the best place to park your money.Sure, in the US since 1945 the longest time it took to recover bear market losses was three years. How long did it take the Russians to recover their losses after the Communists annexed their property? How long has it taken Japanese investors who bought at the peak of the Nikkei to recover their losses?"
1,Unexciting & Uneventful,"""Snow Island"" was a disappointment. I read it, hoping something would happen on the next page. It was quite boring and reading it tedious. Teenaged girls' first crushes & kisses, a middle aged man who couldn't recover from his aunt's death. An aunt, by the way, whom he shared a bed with while growing up, thankfully, not anything to do with sex. Very odd characters in the book -- people I couldn't relate to. Was pretty depressing."
5,magraths,"Our church uses The NIV so to have an 'on the go' product with a translation that is still widely used is helpful both at church at home and in bible study groups. We are still learning the Kindle technology and are hopeful of finding it increasing helpful. Given that we are at the upper end of 'the baby boomer' generation - we are slow but are finding the format increasingly helpful and useful, and looking forward to it being a tool that can help us use God's word more effectively. Thank you"
4,easy to understand,i realy lik this bible. i got it on my fire. i gave it four stars because sometimes when i go to the next page if you touch the wrong place it will take you somewhere else. but it is a great book and is easy to navagate. i would recomend it to anyone.
2,Not searchable or user friendly,It's NIV by Zondervan ---I expected more. The free Amazon Bible was better but not in the translation I wanted. I own a Zondervan Study Bible Hardcopy but I would not reccomend any of their current e Bibles
5,Love It!,I love reading the bible online. I can easily get around the bible quickly in church and during bible studies!
4,Great Bible,"I like the notes about alternate translations and I can more easily understand this Bible, though it does not read as beautifully to me as King James. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is the cross references are sluggish, but that may be the fault of my old iPod Touch."
2,bla,Write your reviews using the traditional review authoring pageNeed Customer Service? Or do you have feedback about writing product reviews?
2,Navigation too hard,"If you want to go to a specific verse, forget it. If you want to quickly move to another chapter, forget it. You must navigate back to the Table of Contents, move your ""cursor"" down (good grief) and then choose the book - unless it's listed on another page, then you need to move to that page first. You can't just Go To the book. Love the NIV. Don't love the NIV Kindle version."
1,SOS History,"This cd is a waste of time and money. What little information it has is not current. Each chapter says to look up information about your state and write a 250 word report. I could have told my kids that, for free! You also cannot set the calendar to the current year. It would make it more difficult to assign work, if there was any."
1,Sistema ProWash,"I have owned this Sistema pressure washer since Christmas 2004 and have used it 4 times. It broke down two out the four times used. I had to send it back to the factory for repairs and received it back to find it would run 15 seconds and stop for 30 seconds and then run 15 seconds again over and over again. Needless to say I gave up on this unit and purchased a Karcher 1650 psi pressure washer and had NO PROBLEMS at all. The Sistema ProWash is cheaply made and falls apart easily. It says it's rated at 1750 psi, but the Karcher 1650 psi unit performed much better."
2,Just OK,"This unit is very easy to use after a quick look at the manual. Did great on windows & pretty good on the deck. We were disappointed in the way it washed our car, still needed scrubbing by hand. My preconception was that we wouldn't have to wash the car by hand anymore. The product claims it's great for washing vinyl siding. They must be joking. You can only use a certain nozzle for cleaning with detergent & with it you only get about a 4 ft. stream of solution....how are you supposed get over your head or up to the second story? I had higher expectations all the way around."
1,Never Buy An Appliance Online,"It sounded great, cost allot & did not work. I threw it away & vowed never to buy an appliance online again."
2,"Nothing wrong, but not much right","Hmm, sorry to deviate from the norm here but we did not like this book at all! We like grandmothers and we like museums so I thought it would be a home run, but my 4 and 6 year olds (and I) found it boring, text-heavy, and lacking in humor, illustration, storyline or anything else that could redeem it. It did not offend or insult, which is why it got 2 stars instead of 1, but it just wasn't fun or interesting! About 2/3 through, as I was bored senseless, my 4-year-old said she was tired and opted to go to bed rather than finish the story. If that's not a non-recommendation, I don't know what is!"
3,Too bad the plastic discolors,"This is my second Springfield clock. The white plastic frame must not have any ultraviolet inhibitors because they turn yellow after a year. I like having an outside clock so I can see it from the pool, this one has big numbers and works fine. I bought a new thermometer to match, it is white and it is annoying that the two devices are different colors."
1,"I WAS SENT THE FOUR WHEELER, NOT THE JEEP!","My little boy was very disappointed, he was expecting what we ordered. which was the jeep with the trailer. What we received was the Four Wheeler with the trailer, it also doesn't talk.I had to spend extra money on shipping it back! I'm pissed!"
4,How About After Getting Married?,"This book has given me some insights into how professional men think about courtship and marriage, etc. The three phases of a man's career sounds reasonable to me. Furthermore, I would like to read about their thoughts on keeping a marriage (not just the physical aspect) fresh and interesting and why professional men have affairs after they have married their wives. It would not hurt to investigate these issues even before one starts to date a professional man."
4,"It has Dina Meyer, what more could you want from a movie","Bristling with sexual tension and corporate intrigue, Crimes of Passion is the story of what happens when two workers who are secret lovers team up in an attempt to score a huge sexual harassment settlement against their employer, a major corporation. When the detective assigned tot he case discovers their scheme and tries to blackmail them, the two are caught in a twisted web of deceit and betrayal. (from the back cover)This movie has decent acting and a pretty good plot. You know almost immediately that the main character, who thinks he is running he show, is being double-crossed. What you don't know is who or how many people are setting him up for the fall. I must say the kind of surprise ending is very satisfying."

1,Didn't last over a year for me,"I purchased this item and it was working well, until it started to act up not even a year later. It would make certain items flick on and off and eventually the whole thing quit on me."

1,You call this PRIME !?,"I tried to download this and got Nada. God owes us nothing, but you owe me 'God Owes Us Nothing'!david a. buehler, PhD"
5,Eye opener,"I read it again and again. The little things at the end of each chapter are especially helpful. Even though I am in college, i feel that it speak right to me where I am."
3,Modern Ireland?,"While this is a worthwhie study and correctly identifies motivations and undercurrents, particularly in the author's choice of, mainly, Northern Irish poets, the fact that not even one of the exceptional women poets writing in Ireland today is included, means that the work does not reflect contemporary Ireland. The author's motivation may be other than this, and I would be gratified to know what was actually intended."
1,Doctrinaire rubbish,"Don't fall for this. The authors are conservative propagandists who engage in the kind of fake scholarship that the American Enterprise Institute and its ilk specializes in. Remember when you were first learning to write a term paper and the teacher said ""don't make the facts fit your argument; your argument has to rest on the facts""? Well the authors were busy running for class president and missed that little lesson. In their world, there is no reason to worry about discrimination laws, or social security, or poverty relief because no-one is ever destitute, excluded or unable to get decent work. Anyone with a passing acquaintance with reality can recognise this for the class warfare that it really is."
5,Put a ittle one on your lap for Toby and the Snowflakes!,"This is a story that respects the feelings and imagination of children. Toby loses his best friend, and in his loneliness, the snow fills in the gap of a good friend. Narrative, by Julie Halpern, and pictures, by Matt Cordell, work seamlessly together in this tender story of a little kid left behind when his best friend moves. This is a book that calls out for a little one to sit on the lap for reading and talking about the pictures. It is a delight!"
3,Fun for a little while,"I purchased this for my family to use at summer get-togethers. After just a few pulls, one of the bands broke. Waste of money."
4,How could this happen in America,"Mr. Litwack has done a gret job writing this book. Hard to believe this happened in the USA. Makes me wish I could go back in time and do something about it. And I am white, teach those crackers a lesson. I give only 4 stars because I felt some of the discriptions went on a little to long and repeated them selfs."
4,Lively and Upbeat,"This album is lively and upbeat with a distinctive sound. I'm never a fan of drug use references, my only peeve. I'm looking forward to see what they produce next."
4,"""The old girl's gone but not forgotten!"" ~Bette Midler~","Fanny Brice lived on in FUNNY GIRL but the other great lady of the time, Sophie Tucker, is lost to us but for a few recordings and films - this among them. Even with the scratchy 1930's recording, this is an unbelievable treasure to remember what an incredible comedienne and songstress the old girl was. This album gives us a view of Sophie Tucker, and the impressive way in which she commanded her lyrics and gave way to a slightly ""blue"" side of vaudeville and an emotionally charged performing career. Racy for her time Sophie's material is fascinating to discover."
1,The train derailed....,I loved Permission To Land and The Darkness' live show I attended was fantastic so I expected something great the second time around. Instead what I found was a weak effort watered down with significant overproduction and lame melodies. Where are the great hooks and hard-driving beat that defined the first album? If Permission To Land reminded me of AC/DC then One Way Ticket is a sad Whitesnake imitation. Painful....
1,One Way Ticket to Hell... And No Return,"Allright! This album has divided people in two groups. Some critics hates this really and think the whole band is joke. Other critics and listeners praise the Darkness like a new saviour of rock n' roll. One magazine chose this the best album of 2005. Unbelieveable and very true!Ok. In my opinion, they made a good music video for One Way Ticket which is rather good song. Unfortunately, after that song there comes 5 really boring, headless and cliche rock songsBald is the best and moving song in this album. The rockers really are afraid of 100 times more to come bald than hell or monsters. Girlfriend, English Country Garden and Blind Man are terrific songs and real pleasure for you who can't hear anything.This record will sell millions because there are enough people who still believe the return of the real classic rock...Finally, there is no return from Hell if you once go there."
2,Over 2 years to come up with something that will be found in the bargain bin very soon,"The Darkness had an interesting debut album months, no check that, years ago. That was not a long CD, neither is this. Justin's voice probably cannot be taken for over 40 minutes. Some people see this band as a joke while others think The Darkness are the second coming. I fall somewhere close to the middle. The debut had at least 50% memorable songs that were fun. They let everyone know they used 70's hard rock as their model for that sound. Queen, Thin Lizzy prime examples. This CD appears to be using more of 80's new wave as the template here. The Cars maybe? This rocks half as hard and that just isn't good enough. Nothing on here rocks for long besides ""One Way Ticket"" and ""Bald"". Sorry guys but you were ""This Year's Model"" 2 years ago. I would have thought with this much time on your hands you could have come up with something better. Hasbeens."
1,Does not work unless perfectly still...,"This car charger will connect to your iPhone and appear to be charging. However, as soon as you start driving and hit the slightest bump it will disconnect and no longer charge your phone. Totally useless. Do not purchase this item!"
1,Carefully cultivated ignorance,"As with David Felix's previous books--especially ""Marx as Politician"" (Thankfully out of print)--this is inane psycho-babble mixed with rumor-mongering, poor citations, and no understanding of economic theory whatsoever. Save your money, your time, and your brain cells."
4,Pretty good advice,"I am studying holistic nutrition and as a student of this type of dietary advice, I found this book a bit counter-productive as to what we tell our clients. Dr. Shapiro has a lot of sound advice when it comes to diet, but his statement that ""No food is bad food"" concerns me. When it comes to diet there are certain foods one should avoid such as diet soda or artificial ANYTHING. He really didn't go along with these ideals and basically focused upon calories and not so much the nutritional aspects of food. But overall he would be a good transition from a strictly junk food diet to something a little more healthy. So I feel that his book would be good for a person that has trouble switching to a completely unprocessed diet.Elecia, MO"

4,A great guide... The one and only!!!,"Definitely a very useful guide for the Knight Rider series... I couldn't put the book down once I got it.. Look out for trivias from each episode from the Knight Rider tv show and find out things u never knew about Knight Rider... The only guide book out there for all the Knight Rider fanatics.. Go get it if u really love the show...I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the pictures in the book though... The pics in the book is not coloured and some aren't very clear. Thats the downside of this book. But if u are looking for facts and info abt Knight Rider, than this book is for u..."
1,"So Dan WAS an Autistic 16 year old, when he wrote this Book","Well, Thank you Dan, you have sent us many paying customers, who found out that the ""Universe of Bagpipes"" is really a Good Site, about a little known Subject: 30 Bagpipes from many different Countries. It's obvious that you (and/or your parents) show a willing ignorance, and hatred for, Bagpipes of any kind. Perhaps you should download the mp3s here on Amazon to enlighten yourselves, but I'm not holding my breath....hah-ha !Getting a review of any kind and being damned with faint, or no praise at all, is always a good way to create interest, as long as the names are spelled correctly. Thank You Dan, you did that part right !Your Piper, Sean Folsom"
1,Made in China,Crappy quality and in order to return I'll have to pay nearly as much as I paid for it. Never buy anything where you have to pay to return. Lesson learned.
1,DIFFICULT TO FIND A RHYTHM,"I think this is one of the poorest written children's books I have ever read. The pacing is difficult and therefore there is no rhythm. The author chooses to insert rhyme with no ""rhyme or reason"", and uses ridiculous font changes, bold facing, sizing, wavy characters etc. with no purpose. My six year old twins have asked to read it once or twice but it just doesn't cut it. Plus, it's overly long. Do not recommend."
4,A hairy mess,I love Margie Palatini and I thought that this book was absolutely hilarious. The illustrations definitely add character to the text and I am always a sucker for a love story.
1,Bright Bright Day Camera,"Camera needs a _LOT_ of light , anything dusk-ie or indoor and things get very noisy (I guess as it tries to compensate for low light)Pictures sometime have a bright 1 pixel horizontal line at the very bottom of the image or a dark line about 8 pixels from the top 8 pixels high.Images are also ""washed out"" and something bright objects seems to bleed (making a halo like effect) , I don't know if it's due to poor focus of the CCD."
2,too routine,Although a slight improvement overpart two the entire series stillsuffers from sluggish pacing.
5,A Gentle Tribute to the Best Things In Life,"Nancy Lindemeyer has written a beautiful tribute to the people and memories that she has ""packed"" for her life's journey. Her sweet remembrances of her grandmother are especially touching. This book is about cherishing what is truly important in life and making connections with people. The author's memories provided her the base, the strength, to accomplish her dreams in life. Lots of people have these strengths to draw on -- Lindemeyer reminds us to actually do so."
5,Recipe for the Essence of Zen,"If you asked me what is the essence of Zen I would hand you this book. The Hsin Hsin Ming is the recipe to get to the essence of Zen. If you asked me what does a fine desert tasted like, it would do no good to describe it to you as nothing would compare to actually tasting it for yourself. Books cannot give you the actual ""taste"" of Zen, you must taste it for yourself. The best I can do is give you the recipe and let you cook it up yourself. In fact, read books about Zen if you want, just as you could read books about cakes and pies, but all you need to really realize it for yourself is wrapped up in this one recipe. Cook it up and enjoy!"
1,Dated homophobic trash,"Apparently, this is a love it or hate it movie. It shows gay men at their most pathetic level. It brooks no positive view of gay men in 1970. This is seriously not what life was like then. This movie represents how Hollywood wanted gays to appear. In movies of the 70s, gays were pathetic losers or insane or hopelessly doomed to loneliness. In American cinema, real men were strong, so homosexuals were weak. Friedkin was the bigot who gave us Cruising.I hate this movie."
4,Almost perfect!,"I used to play this game all the time as a kid on the NES, and I still love it! It's the perfect game to pick up and play when I'm bored or need to kill a little time without being ""sucked in."" It is quite addicting, but not so much that I want to sit down and play it all afternoon. The only thing I don't like about it is that the game hasn't been updated from the NES version AT ALL. So all of the original flaws (can't play against a computer, getting capsules of colors you already killed off) are still there. Otherwise it's a great game! I might have to get my brother a copy so we can play together..."
2,Too tiny to see,"I loved the original Dr. Mario, so when I got a GameBoy version I was excited. It's very Tetris-like, except for making complete rows, you are matching up 4 like colors of pill halves to the same color virus until they have all been matched and eliminated. Unfortunately, the ""pills"" are so tiny that it is difficult to enjoy this process. My vision is fine, yet I find myself squinting at the screen trying to make out the different colors in order to decide where to drop them. This was a good idea, but it doesn't work on such a small scale. However, if trying to make out minute details doesn't bother you, then you will probably enjoy this classic - especially if you love Tetris and are burned out on it."
5,Love it,Beautiful fly over scenes and some trips to castles and the land surrounding them. Well worth the cost to view the rugged and lovely Scotland.
5,"Great Quality, Very Durable","I purchased these pocket protectors after my old ones were subjected to the depredations of time and must voice my pleasure in my purchase. These pocket protectors are made of a very nice, durable material and fit perfectly in my work shirts. Even after four months, I've only used the first one. It is presently starting to tear at the edges, but that's my fault (I put far too much in them). But, even if it does break, I have plenty more! That's the best part of the order: you don't just get one, you get a few.They arrived in a timely manner.Very pleased."
2,Flimsy construction,"Oxford Pocket Protectors, Grained White Vinyl, 3/packConsidering how little vinyl items cost and that it's likely these were manufactured totally by machine, and given their flimsy ""quality"" 3 for $10 for these is absurd. If they were like the pocket protectors of old, substantial, I wouldn't cavil. But these are incredibly flimsy. As soon as I put one into the pocket of my shirt and put a pen and a pen light in it, the outside flap began to curl up - this wouldn't have happened back in the day and is unacceptable today. Likely another ""benefit"" of globalization and the destruction of American manufacturing. No manufacturer name on these - likely wouldn't be so if made in the USA with the quality we used to have. Buy them if you wish - I'll never buy them again."
5,Extremely Enjoyable CD - Very Hip Guitarist!,"Very cool from start to finish, with some very slick, amazing guitar work. This is more than smooth jazz, it's funky and hip with lots of variety, jazz, funk, latin-salsa, a bossa nova track, thoroughly enjoyable. If you like jazz-funk with some soaring ""Santana-like"" solos, you'll love this cd!"
2,Messages Cut Off,"I was alreday a bit disillusioned with this phone before I read that first review. Now I am definitely taking it back. For me I find it cutting off messages left before they are complete. I am going to get a Panasonic I think. I do not recommend this phone for safety reasons cited in reviewer 1, and the display is really hard to read, as well as messages getting cut off."
1,im pretty sure your the one who wrote the book,"are you kidding me, a book on how to download music.smoke weed"
4,water wheel,We bought this as a bath and pool toy for our daughter's 1st birthday. We've had it for almost 5 months and it is still one of her favorite bath toys!
3,Disappointing,"It is disappointing. There is only a DEMONSTRATION of steps, well, they do write so on the cover (I wish it warned me). There is no explanations, no metodological instructions, no music."
1,Major disappointment,"So not every book an author crafts can measure up to her best work, but this falls so far short that it's embarrassing. If her name wasn't on it, I wouldn't think Bradley (or her estate) even wrote this book. I won't rehash what other reviewers have to say, but they hit the nail on the head. Laughable dialogue (and not in a good way), unbelievable actions, and the most awkward wrap-up of an ending I've encountered. Good premise, BAD delivery. And I don't know who should be faulted: the author or her editor."
3,Comment on review above,"With all due respect, the reviewer above is mistaken about ""contemporary"" composers. The ones listed -- Elgar, Bartok, Holst, Saint-Saens -- all died between 1921-1945. In fact, most were dead before today's leading contemporary composers -- Corigliano, Knussen, John Adams, for heavens sake even Philip Glass were born! This reviewer's ""contemporary"" composers all croaked long before rock n' roll started!"
3,sonicelectronix fails,"i purchased this from sonic electronix saying that it would fit my 2006 golf, i recieve the package, all gm kit. does not fit mine at all. and amazon's dimensions are wrong. just sayin.. its. 4x8 ish.i am only using the pocket, and am looking for a buyer for the rest of the pieces."
5,Tell me that,"I wish they would have included the album version of ""Tell Me"" on the remixes, but just to have a copy of that ""raga mix"" on cd is like gold. ""Tell me"" is an r and b classic and they don't make songs like this no mo, so ya gotta have it."
1,HI. My name is Jim Marrs. I'm a crackpot.,"For those of you who for one second actually believe this, please, please, please get out of the house. There is no secret on the dollar bill.

3,Good Music But Not 5 stars,This is a good band and the singer is interesting but its not s 5 star Album by any means I good LP but thats it
5,Fabulous book that will be of benefit for years to come.,"I read this book when it first was published because I was in an executive position with a not for profit organization. Throughout the years I have referred to it and each time it has revealed another secret in my life style. I loaned it to a friend and never got it back, so am now buying my second copy. Truly a keeper whether it is used for business or success in your personal endeavors."
4,Chinese Brush Painting,This book is an excellant reference and guide for the beginner and advanced artist alike. Several attractive subjects are demonstrated with step by step examples of the tradiitional brush strokes used in this ancient art form.
3,Castells book ok,"Castells' book ""The Internet Galaxy"" is a book that is good but not great. The book starts out with a really good explanation of the history of the Internet and the different cultures that are involved with the Internet. After this though there are a few interesting things in the middle chapters, but the end of the book is pretty lame. The end of the book is pretty lame because it has a lot of commonsense statements and statistics that are not very interesting."
2,Internet Galaxy,"I find this book relatively interesting. Especially the development of the internet and it's attributes as a whole. It is almost amazing how the internet evolved from a network connecting different research universities to the massive, complex information super-highway it is today. Looking back at the decisions that the large corporations made to not take part in the initial launch of the internet, they almost seem insane.Overall, I feel that the book was an average book. It was full of very valuable information. However, it was very difficult to read and at times it was very difficult to keep my interest in the book."
2,Review of Internet Galaxy,"After reading The Internet Galaxy by Manuel Castells, I can honestly say that I have not learned as much as I would have hoped. Castells does a great job of outlining how the Internet came to be. In addition, he makes controversial statements that have the ability to facilitate discussions/debates. However, there is a lot of unnecessary information in the book. He gives many statistics and thoughts that are pretty much common sense for anyone with any computer savvy. Finally, he fails to discuss the issue of technology in education, which is a very important issue to many in this class. Overall, I think it would be a good book to read for someone who did not have any previous knowledge of what the Internet entailed. However, for those readers with any Internet experience, it is hard to get through all of the useless statistics to get to the heart of Internet issues."
3,Sarah Abbott,"I thought that this book was very repetitous. Castells is very opinionated and has strong feelings about the internet and especially the people involved with it.He did cover the history of the internet very well and had a lot of detailed facts. He also covered the social groupings of internet users well. He tended to repeat himself and I thought he was one sided in some of his points. It could be easy to get lost in his biased opinions and not to pay close attention to what he was trying to say.Overall, I thought this book was alright. It was not a very interesting attention grabber book however."
2,Or how calendula can get dry,"Seriously, how can you make a dry calendula product? It totally beats the purpose of it. This soap just dries up, I could not believe it myself. Calendula is supposed to be great for eczema and dry skin but with that soap, it gets worse. Not enough calendula and too much chemicals, I'm sure. Way too expensive for what it is."
2,New to the business buy it,I've been selling cars online for 4 years now. This book was very basic. If you are new to selling cars online buy this book. If you have done it for a while not worth the money.
1,Self Agrandizing & Pandering,"Terrible read. Nothing new. Elementary and useless. DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME or $$. Just how many cars has this author sold? Hmmm, do as I say and not as I do. Get a real job"
1,lead warning,This product is as described as far as the description goes. What they don't tell you is that the lamp has no on/off switch. You have to plug/unplug or have a switch on your power source. They also don't tell you that the product has a warning that it contains lead which causes cancer and that you should wash your hands after handling it. What a pain! Why should an aluminum lamp with a cord contain lead? Get the lead out! Made in China
4,"Light weight, Pinky lifter","This cup is great for backcountry camping. You can strap it to your pack since it weighs so little. You could also stuff it with socks and throw it in the top of your pack.It is pretty easy to clean, or not clean at all, drink your coffee or tea, then drink some water from it and that is enough.The handles fold in for storage. I give it 4 stars because the handles could be longer. They are only good for thumb plus ring finger, middle finger to hold.You can either cramp your hand or lift your pinky, it is like high tea, oh so elegant, 4 days from your last shower."
4,Great Little Cup,This is a nice little cup. I stuff something soft in it and throw it in my bag and almost forget it's there.Four stars because the handles are a bit small and close to the cup for holding really hot liquids or heating over a fire. Good quality.
3,just an opinion not a review,"I don't actually own this , I own the titan kettle so I am not going to review this. I am just going to comment on the price. Imho this over priced . This cup works out to be just slightly under 400 ml and I just recently purchased a snow peak titanium cup with a volume of 600 ml for only $28. Snow Peak also makes a 450 ml and a 300 ml as well . All much cheaper than the msr titan cup. These should be considered before shelling out $39 for the msr."
4,Good omens,"A difficult but extremely worthwhile book. It seems to me that authentic stream of consciousness writing should actually be easy to read since all of us spend our entire waking lives bathing in our own stream of consciousness. I would argue that the fact that this style of writing is generally considered difficult and abstract points to its inauthenticity. I wonder if Gass himself suspects this - Furber, after all, proclaims life to be a long ""stream of piss"" near book's end. Overall, a very touching and insightful story; the second half of the book is especially well constructed.Totally unrelated to the book itself - the afterword by Gass is bizarre! I assume this is true - if so, the story of how the novel actually got written and published is quite amazing itself."
4,High Formalism,"William Gass' first major literary accomplishment is a finely woven flight of mythic prose. Brackett Omensetter-a man with inexplicable luck-travels to an obscure town of Gilean on the Ohio River with his family where his existence faces off with Jethro Furber, a preacher with deeply evil tendencies. The majority of Omensetter's Luck is presented from Furber's point of view, and if there is something enduring in the work it is Gass' command of this disturbing voice. However, Gass' formalism also slips into strange flights of fancy-characters speak in elegant poesy, and the constancy of the stream of consciousness causes some serious murkiness. Nevertheless, this is a very beautiful book of real complexity and nuance. It continues to demand multiple readings."
5,Unbelievable!,"This consider a new tech for Zire71 user like myself.This is because according to Palm,Zire71 can't run WIFI function.I haven't try out this sandisk SD WIFI yet,but if really work thenmy salute to Sandisk!"
4,Very good history of computing,"As noted in previous reviews, the book covers American computer/networking history moreso than the Internet proper. I found the origins of ARPA and the major companies to be fascinating. Certainly the author doesn't go into technical detail into protocols and such, no moreso than a WWII history book has to teach the subject of military strategy. The best thing about the book was the lighthearted style, that did a good job of showing these industry heavyweights as real people."
4,Still depressed,"Good movie with a horrific ending. While a lot of reviewers had problems with the factual events - ""how is it possible that the little jewish boy can sit at the fence unobserved"", etc.,REMEMBER - this is a MOVIE, not a documentary.If you are easily depressed, this is not a movie to watch and I certainly would not recommend it for children under 10."
2,Won't play,"So this is a GREAT movie, but when I finally opened it to watch it won't play and I threw out the receipt so I'm pretty much stuck with it. I don't think it was the seller's fault, sometimes they won't play so I guess I'll be re-ordering."
1,No ENGLISH closed captions for the hearing impaired,"Mr. Iger of Walt Disney World Companies (miramax).There are many movies we would liked to have seen but, they do not have ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the menu set up. Why is it that a movie being distributed in the United States of America has spanish or some other language for subtitles in the menu set up? The PRIMARY language in America is ENGLISH. As we are hearing impaired and must have ENGLISH closed captions in the menu set up. I guess we will miss a lot of the movies produced by your companies.Without ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the movie menu set up, we will not be able to purchase particular movies of interest. The one of most recent interest was The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas. You lost a sale on this one and I am sure as well as others in the future."
5,Boy in Striped Pajamas,"This is a movie which should be seen by everyone. If one is looking for pure entertainment, this is not the movie for you. However, it is a riveting and thought provoking movie and should be seen by those who deny the Holocaust."
3,Most depressing movie ever,"This was a very well-made movie, with excellent acting, casting, camera-work, etc., but I can't get away from the fact that it was the most depressing movie I have ever watched. I know that movies like this have to be made, and not every movie should have a happy ending, but I guess I just want to warn people about this. This film is going to hit you hard, and stay with you for a long time."
3,"Not bad, not great","I have read the book and now watched the movie and I felt the same way about both. It's okay. The story itself is really good, I think. The execution in both the book and movie is good overall, but flawed. I'll try to focus on the movie here. My main problem with the movie involves acting.The boy who plays Shmuel is not great. Plus, they chose a boy with a chubby face to play a Jew in a concentration camp. Kind of odd. There was zero chemistry between Bruno and Shmuel. They're supposed to be best friends, but they seemed fairly indifferent to each other for the most part.Bruno's mother and father, played by Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis, were by far the best part of this movie. I love Vera in just about everything and this was no exception. Perhaps if the young actors in this movie learn from these two, they'll become great actors someday."
1,The Feature Presentation on the DVD will not play.,Only the previews of other movies play on the DVD Boy in the stripped pajamas will play. The feature presentation itself will not play. I contacted the sellers and was told to clean it with alcohol and it still does not work. The is no movie on the DVD.Yvonne Casen
1,Leave the Book on the Shelf,"Hungry for anything HLOTS related I picked up this companion book. In providing some interesting tidbits about the actors lives, it does illuminate some story lines. But that is about it. The numerous editorial errors make the book a waste of good coin.A b-more guy"
5,Great Beach Reading: A Complex Woman Explained,"This book is wonderful. It not only covers Madonna's simple beginnings and her rise to the top - it also puts into perspective all of the complex relationships Madonna has had, and how they changed her. I thought this would be a sensational slasher bio, but I ended up having far more respect for her after reading it. Yes, there are a bunch of dishy tales of bitchiness (enough to give a chuckle or two), but the real story here is the drive and determination that Madonna used to overcome every obstacle placed in front of her."
2,"Only One Step Above ""The National Inquirer""....","I was fairly disappointed in this book...I believe the author has taken quite a few liberties with his facts, sources, & quotes! Most of this book comes off like a ""docu-drama"" (for example, how could the author possibly know what Madonna is thinking as she stares at her newest wrinkles in the mirror?) Also, the author's characterization of Madonna's 80's fling, Prince, sounds like he watched ""Purple Rain"" (a 17-yr-old movie) a few times to be able to describe him. In other words, there's little more than generalizations, hearsay, & gossip presented as an actual biography. Christopher Anderson's book is much better."
4,Another satisfied customer,The movie Solomon showed up on time and in like new condition!! It is a good movie although I think they spent too much time on Queen Sheba(I wanted to see more of his supposedly 700 wives). I will definitely keep Solomon in my collection of bible movies.
2,Long and tedious,All the elements that make good drama are lacking in this long and faithful telling of the story of Solomon. I bought it hoping to play it for my plder Sunday School kids but they won't sit still for it
2,Only for serious Akkerman fans,"I bought this as a CD in 2012, forgetting that I had owned it as a vinyl LP in the late 70s. If I had remembered, I would not have bought it again. I DO like the final 7 short songs of the album: some blues-rock that sounds improvised; also a jig and a couple medieval pieces that are cool but not as well developed as some similar works that appeared on Focus 3, Hamburger Concerto, and Akkerman's album Tabernakel. HOWEVER, the first cut, ""Fresh Air"", is a tedious, 20 minute example of one of those 1970s unsuccessful attempts to elevate rock music to a higher art form. Yes, there are some impressively-fast guitar licks which are instantly recognizable as Jan Akkerman. But, otherwise, I find the song unlistenable; beginning and end are dreary, noisy chaos in between. Quite a bipolar album!"
5,Collectably funny,Too funny times six! Abbot and Costello transended vaudville to become my favorite box office comedians. A great hit with my wife!
3,Fun and all,"As noted before, there isn't much character development, but this is a fun space opera. The events in the book occur before Insurrection, so you need not have read it before this, unless you just want to get a feel for the weapons and structure of the universe. I found my eyes glazing over during the ground combat moments, and of course the literal translation of the Scottish accent was death to me, but overall I enjoyed the book. I'm looking forward to In Death's Ground, as it seems to have a bit more substance, but I recommend this book as well."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I too hoped this product would rein in my tummy, but alas, all it did was smoothen my existing pooch. Not helping. Also panty lines in the back."
5,"Bows, Arrows and Hunting for Dummies","This book is the result of the authors bringing decades of personal field experience, not ""war stories"", to all who read it. Add to that the up-to-date tech information provided, the complicatied made simple of moderen archery equipment setup and the intricacies of traditional archery clearly explained makes this book a valuble addition to your archery and hunting library.If I had to choose only one book to help me understand the how-to and realationships between bow, arrow, accessory equipment, hunter and quarry this would be the one."
1,BETRAYAL! NO MOVIE ON THIS BLU RAY-STILLS ONLY!,The BLU-RAY and movie are a BETRAYAL to the CUSTOMER because there is NO MOVIE shown about this project. You see stills of the walk and poor quality coverage material of some policemen and construction work. That is all. The actor himself deserves 10 PLUS-POINTS for his BRAVERY but the rest of the BLU-RAY is decently called a profit attempt to make money on something which does not even exist in a poor quality. Forget it! A nice told story on the wrong medium.
2,Certainly not five stars,"I have no idea how this has been rated so highly. Maybe the people who rated it are huge fans of tightrope walkers and it maybe deserves five stars compared to other tightrope documentaries, but compared to other documentaries this is a two star production."
2,unnecessary nudity and sexual content,"I choose to watch this documentary with my kids so they could see the Twin Towers as I saw it as a kid. Philipe's commitment, and determination to reach his vision seemed admirable. Just when he accomplished his great feat the film digressed to vulgarity showing a nude/sexual scene. this was PG-13 rating. I had 12 and 13 year old watching with me and they were disturbed and walked away. ""What did that have to do with anything?"" they were asking. We never finished it. Disturbing and disappointing."
2,Skip,I don't know why many people chose to rate this movie so highly. I tried to give it an honest chance but it was just boring.
5,NO WORDS,No real words exist to explain it. A masterpiece straight up. Beyond belief. Should be seen by everyone. I am haunted by the music by Erik Satie called Gymnopedies 1. Not to be missed!
2,poor ending,"We know he survives the adventure, so this is not a spoiler. The ending after this great triumph fell so flat. Chalk it up to human selfishness."
2,Must have for the reef keeper,"This book is the second most important book for reefkeepers, (after volume 1). Very well written and the photographs are excellent."
1,Think again before you buy this!!,"I bought Panasonic PVDV51D camcorder about 5 months ago and it is already giving several problems. The picture gets split into several small rectangular squares and it is very difficult to watch it. I called the panasonic service center and they said it would cost me 149$ (plus 12$ shipping and handling)flat rate service charge no matter what the problem is! ( about half the price of a new camcorder). I would strongly recommend not buying it or buying extended warranty since the warranty that comes with the new product is deceptive i.e. though it covers parts for a year, they would charge you too much in the form of LABOR charges."
3,More Joy Electric than Starflyer,"I've been a fan of both Martins since the beginnings on T&N; (and I even have some Dance House Children stuff), so I was really looking forward to this.All in all, I think it's worth listening to and probably owning, for the serious fan, but I don't think it's anything special. Probably because it mostly reminds me of Ronnie, and I got tired of & stopped buying his stuff quite a while ago. ""The Deaf, They will Hear"" is a really annoying/bad song, moreso than any other song of either of theirs I can think of (although truthfully there's only one SF59 song I dislike, and nothing bugs me much about the old JE) so that's not saying much."
5,Stranger in Moscow,Great balad and melody in all aspects with of course the always very good vocal performance of Michael Jackson. I definetly recommend this song to all of you. Fabien
5,Hall OF FAME MJ Song,"this song Showcases the Michael Jackson that many People don't get to hear enough of.the Song-Writer going into Clear territory.I didn't care about Re-Mixes for this song because the Song,Music,Vocals&Video are struck a Major Chord with me.I'd really dig it if MJ did a Unplugged Album in this Vein.Classic Words&Music here."
2,No more than expected,I wouldn't expect any less from F.M. she is the tops in her field this story was so good I picked it up at three this afternoon and just finished at midnight couldn't stop laid it down long enough to warm up leftovers for dinner............was crying last two chapters but so enjoyable and a fun read of a real family in my heart.
2,not again,"ok maybe I am reading the wrong books she writes lol. This is the second and it was not good. Too rushed with the romance, and it was really boring not much drama at all"
1,Perfectly named,"This book accomplishes all that the title implies.From cover to cover, this book blames the victims of Arab aggression against Israel and against the Jews of the Middle East. Near the start, Norman G. Finkelstein, rather than seriously discussing Joan Peters' excellent work ""From Time Immemorial,"" calls it a ""hoax"" based upon relatively picayune disagreements with just one of its many arguments.Perhaps the final chapter, by Ed Said, Ibrahim and Janet Abu-Lughod, Muhammad Hallaj, and Elia Zurek, is the most amazing for its alternative version of history. Sadly, the rest of this book is also divorced from reality."
3,Not bad for the price,"I was new to fondue when I bought two of these 11-piece sets for around $13 each. They are fun and wanted to use it for my daughter's birthday party. Not knowing what I was doing, I burned the chocolate my first time around and had to throw the whole batch away. Now to avoid burning stuff, I put water in the bottom of the fondue pot and sit a stainless steel bowl inside the pot filled with chocolate or cheese or whatever. The bowl I have seems to fit perfectly. While I may have modified the product alittle, that is the only way I'd use it to avoid burning anything, so it works for me. Also, the forks are fun and color-coded to avoid mix-ups of whose is whose."
1,"one word describes this film, Banal",THe films main problem is that it decides to break conventions in the worst way by having no sense of direction or charaterlization. THe film is an un unforgivingly bad film that hapens to leavge the view compleltly unintrested in an compelling story. The story telling for the time is also medicore given what david lean was able to accomplish years eailer. There is nothing of intrests in this film . Any one who liked is a complet moron and dosent have a bit of taste. THis goes to all people who wrote reviews for this film. you all have no taste or understandingas to what a good film is. I wirte reviews for the long youth film society.
2,A Night To Remember,I really wanted this DVD for my grandson and when we went to watch it it didn't play right. Froze and skipped. Would have liked to have had it replaced but apparently they don't do that.
1,Poor quality,"Very disappointed, the first cd would not play,ordered another, same problem. Obviously this product was not checked for quality. Was told not to order another as this problem would be reported to customer service. Expect more from Amazon products."
5,A TITANIC FILM (AND NO CELINE DION IN SIGHT!),"A titanic film, first released in 1958, that still makes a powerful impact. This telling of the sinking of the Titanic, based on Walter lord's classic book oft he same name, is still the best of the lot. No special effects, no annoying close-ups, no relentless warbling about hearts going on and on and on and . . .. Criterion deserves kudos for reissuing the film inDVD, in a digital transfer so pristine and a sound so clear it is almost frightening. Added bonus: ""The Making of `A Night to Remember,"" a 60-minutre documentary with fascinating, rare behind-the-scenes footage. Full steam ahead!"
2,Disappointed,"This movie still remains the best Titanic flick made.James Cameron's Titanic recreated the ship historically but did not recreate the panic or human drama as much as this movie. I was disappointed with Criterion's version of this movie. The picture was no better than VHS. The sound...MONO....What gives? With many classics of this era being brillantly transformed by DVD, this one is ordinary and does not deserve the price requested. The audio commentary by Lynch and Marshall is also outdated."
1,Movie would not play... :(,Just a heads up to potential buyers; this blue ray disk would not load for me and I tried two different players...:(
1,Disappointed Nokia customer. Keypad awkward and slow.,"I have been a Nokia customer for as long as I've had phones. This is the first time I've been disappointed.First - the center ""enter"" key is too small. I end up accidentally hitting the arrow keys every other time I try to press it.Second - sometimes the phone seems to not respond to key presses or respond with significant latency. I don't know if this is hardware or software-related. But it's infuriating. I've missed calls and other problems due to it.Yeah - only two problems. But they're BIG problems. I am disappointed. I'll be getting a new phone soon."
4,pretty good little phone,"I like this phone quite a bit. It really has all the bells and whistles that the more expensive ones have except for the camera (which I never used anyway). The main complaint I have is that when you put it in your pocket or purse, numbers on the keypad get hit and entered. I have been locking the phone when I don't use it (very easy to do) so this won't happen. If it rings, I can still answer it, I just can't call out while it is locked. I couldn't decide between this and the razr but read too many complaints about the razr and didn't want to get mixed up with a phone that seemed to have quite a few faults. Navagation key is also quite small but isn't really a big problem. I like the fact that the speaking headset also is the listening headset for the radio. You can take the phone on walks while listening to the radio and not worry about missing a call."
4,tiny wonder,"I was looking for a light digital camcorder suitable for travel. The GR-DVP3U was a good solution. The camera is tiny and light - also made of metal so its durable. Pros: Great video, pretty good in low light, small. Cons: Stills are low res, battery life, no RCA in. Nice toy."
1,Should've bought a Sony DCRIP5 instead!!!,"I just got this camcorder and I got very disappointed. It was impossible for me to use it on an outdoor party at night.With the price, I thought this camcorder would be better than Sony DCRIP5 which my friend just bought. And the Sony camcorder works just perfect despite the fact that it's even smaller than this JVC camcorder."
4,Memories...,"This video is a series of clippings from the Muppet Show, narrarated by Fozzie Bear and Kermit the Frog. It is a short but sweet video, highlighting some of the best moments and greatest guest stars to appear during the all-too-short run of the series. There are a handful of these ""greatest hit"" videos, but Fozzie's scrapbook is by far the best. I highly recommend it as a crash course for those who never got to experience the show. Or if you're looking for that one sketch that you loved, there's a good chance you'll find it here."
4,An excellent continuation and an even better beginning,"I typically do not like books about television shows. But this is a very definate exception. (Along with the Telepath trilogy) Peter David definately has a good grasp of the characters. This isn't Londo as written by some guy. THIS IS LONDO. The same applies to the rest of the characters that we knew from the series. The only real complaints I have are to do with continuity, and those have already been expressed by other reviews here. For a fan of the show, this book is a must. If you're not a fan, I still strongly recommend it. Londo is a strong, very compelling character who knows through prophesy that he is going to end up badly. He will be responsible for the deaths of millions. He already is, and more will fall before he is done. But through it all, he only tries to do what is right for his people. The events happen in spite of him AND because of him. And now I prepare to read part II..."
5,A must for all B5 fans,Here it is I have the entire trilogy and let me tell you they are awesome!!! This book really ties up alot of loose ends from the end of the series. Extremly well written.....not for the casual reader this is a work of art.
2,Easy to apply but didn't hold up,This Uber Goop was easy to apply as directed. I was really hopeful that it would work but unfortunately it wore off quickly where the bottom rim of the dinner plates contact the rack.
3,"Okay, I guess.","I have to agree with some of the other reviews--the case is a bit too large and not what I expected. You could probably fit two, if not even three sets of Koss Portapros in it. I don't very much see cramming a lot of other items into the case, it might damage the headphones. What the case needs is a core that the phones could slip around and would prevent the case from caving in. It's really not that solid or durable. If you put this in a full suitcase or in the bottom of a knapsack it would be easily crushed. This is NOT a true ""tortoiseshell"" case. If you're looking for a hard-shell case--look somewhere else. However, if you're comfortable storing your $35 set of Portapros in an over sized Hushpuppy, then this is about as good as you're going to get for the money."
3,Too large...,"This product provides a good protection to my PortaPro, but I think that this case is too large for the PortaPro..."
4,"""80's Classic!""","This 1985 action film features a martial artist confrontingthugs and finding love. I watched this a lot on tv growingup and always liked it. I'm glad to have it on dvd that hasgood picture and sound, but only commentary and trailers.I recommend this 80's classic."
4,"This was a ""Sho-nuff"" good little film!","I saw this movie @ least twice in 1985....not too groudbreaking but fun anyway! The dialogue & plot were corny but a lot of 80's movies were corny, sometimes corny can be good nowadays! Vanity's acting was a little thin for me but this was not a dramatic movie. Despite all the cheesiness it's a fun film & family friendly except for some of the scenes between Leroy & that scary Shonuff (Sho-nuff???? Hilarious!) & My 7 year old son gets a kick out of it as well as my 2 nephews. So glad this is out on dvd. The clothing, music, & dancing take me back to a fun time in my life. The picture quality does leave a lot to be desired but this is an older movie. I always enjoyed watching Taimak but he looks absolutely, jaw droppingly awesome now; 20+ years later!!! Check out his website!"
5,The Tempting Taimak,"I absolutely love this movie. I can watch it over and over again. This was a movie that I grew up watching. I had the biggest crush on Taimak! The movie combined comedy, fantasy and romance. I enjoyed Vanity in her ""Prince"" days as well. Check out little Rudy Huxtable (Keisha Pulliam-Knight) as Leroy's baby sister. It always brings me to tears at the end when Leroy realizes that he has been searching for the master, while all along HE was the master. The bottom line of this movie for me was believing in yourself...."
5,Bruce Leroy!,"I just recently saw a movie on BET (movie of the week) And guess who was in it! I couldn't beleive it was BRUCE LEROY, THATS WHO!! Just seeing him, took me back to my most favorite movie! I for one can recite it, sing it, dance it. The whole 9! This is one of the greatest movies of all time! It will surely, ""Sok-it-to You""! One for the archives! ""Sho-Nuff""!!"
4,Tongue-in-cheek humor with good action and great 80's music,"How can you not appreciate a movie that includes the ""shogun of Harlem"", a fat Cindy Lauper wanna-be, and a black kung fu master named Bruce Leeroy? Prime 80's cheese accentuated by the beautiful countenance of Vanity."
4,Should have made part II,"I have watched this movie over twenty times, and I am still enjoying it. I was hoping for a part II. Berry Gordy should do more movies!!"
5,Favorite Cookbook,"This book has so many good recipes in it, I don't know where to start! My favorite is the Salmon Stuffed with Mascarpone Cheese and Spinach (use frozen). The recipe bakes it but I put mine on the grill. The Morehead City Shrimp Burgers is another favorite, as well as the Buttery Garlicky Steamed Clams. The book doesn't have any pictures in it, but don't let that be your deciding factor, the recipes are really good, and each recipe is accompanied by a brief description or introduction. Some of the recipes feature fish that may not be popular for all areas but in those cases, the author may mention that another type of fish can be substituted. Or substitute your favorite fish. If you are not familiar with buying and cooking fish and seafood, the author lays out the basics in the beginning of the book which covers the difference between fresh and frozen, what to look for, storing, and appropriate cooking methods."
4,Almost perfect...,"This watch is a wonderful, durable backup to your dive computer. Made of titanium, it doesn't suffer from the heavy weight of other dive watches. I absolutely love everything about it, with two exceptions: the placement of the water sensor turns the ""dive mode"" on if you happen to be sweating; even though the watch is marked to glow in the dark, it is unreadable at night. There's no light and the marking is so poorly designed that you can't make anything out. It is reasonably accurate (about 3 seconds a month)."
1,Not a watch for divers who travel,"I got this watch for Christmas (possibly at my strong suggestion). No warning at all in the description that you can not change from Imperial to Metric (can't change from Feet to Meters, or Fahrenheit to Celsius).Are you kidding me??? Are the people at Citizen totally RETARDED? or do they think that their US clients will never travel outside the US to go diving. Last time I checked: The Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, the Mediterranean - pretty much the entire world uses metric.Every other sports watch I have ever owned easily changed unit between the two. Somehow the design challenged people at Citizen didn't get the memo."
5,Shameless Greedy Adults,It it shameful to see greedy adults putting ridiculous prices on these children's books and keeping them from children who could be learning from them. The one thing that is absolutely certain is that no one in their right mind is going to to pay $71 for this $5 book. It just shows that some people are willing to hoard and hold on to items that could be put to good use because of their greed and it is absolutely shameful. Hopefully these publishers will republish these books and continue to leave these greedy people out in the cold.
2,Interesting history of german porcelain making,"The Arcanum is the history of making porcelain in the seventeenth century in Germany.The search started when an alchemist who was looking for ""the philosopher's stone"" to transmute base metals into gold, failed at his search but came up with the secret formula for making hardpaste porcelain in Europe for the first time. Greedy kings play a large part, and wars are an integral part of the story.This book would definitely have benefited from the inclusion of photographs of some of the old pieces that are in museums today."
5,ripping yarn of porcelain discovery,"As a budding enthusiast of Meissen porcelain, I found this book enormously enjoyable and informative. Gleeson clearly and entertainingly presents the sometimes complicated and confusing story of the discovery of porcelain in the West. She vividly portrays the various characters involved in the discovery and early development of hard paste porcelain. Gleeson might not be a great writer, but I have to admit to waking up early to enjoy her book.Even is you have no interest in this area of decorative art, the story is fascinating enough in its own right to ensure a gripping and enjoyable read. Who knows, you may become a porcelain convert!"
3,Javascript Bible is good but missing,"I just bought Javascript Bible Gold Edition. I am grateful that I only paid $28.00 from Amazon. Not $69.99, no thanks. I don't buy it in a store. I buy it only at Amazon. So I notice there is something missing in the book. It only show code language. It doesn't explain clear, only brief. No pictures and no codes example. I suggest you not just buying this book. Also Dummies and other good books that go with Javascript Bible. For all javascript languages, I recommend this book."
5,1980's movies are awesome,".This movie might be a low budget film from the 80's, but it is one of the coolest. It is just like American Pie and all those teen heart throb movies they have now a days. When was the last time you saw ""battle of the bands"" featured in a movie? I cannot believe the sexual sense of humor they actually got away with back then, but it rocks! Not only will guys enjoy it, but all you gals will too. It might also remind you of your high school days, because the plot is about two rival schools. And yes they do get even with each other! So watch it, if you can find it!!!"
1,Boring,"I'm an adult who can sometimes get lost in a video game. Not this one. Many years ago I had a Leisure Suit Larry game that I really enjoyed and hoped that this would be a little bit along those lines. It wasn't. You're pretty much trapped into a boring schedule of being locked in your apartment, or out at school with only a couple of minutes to do anything. There's an incredibly limited amount of things you can do in each section of the game, and when you finally get somewhere (or get a date) the payoff is anti-climactic. Game has a few bugs too. Repetitions, a character asking you to call - and then you have to go through the same dialogue you did earlier in the game when you do. Confusion and glitches in other areas too. Save yer money. :)"
1,Not the whole package!!!!!,"I can't really speak for the quality of the textbook, I have no choice or say in that matter as a college student. However, there is a passcode to access online homework that all of the classes at Michigan Tech REQUIRE that is not included with these textbooks!!!! I am not able to do or submit homework and now have to buy the passcode separately for over a hundred dollars. JUST FOR A MEANS TO LOG IN TO A WEBSITE. outrageous. JUST BUY A NEW BOOK."
3,Great movie except from the subtitles!!! :( :(,The subtitle editor ruined the whole experience; s/he framed the whole movie from being a workers' tale to a competition between two activists. In the end the crowd cheering for Solidarnosk (the movement of Solidarity that carried the struggle to begin with) was shown in the subtitles to be cheering for the young emerging political leader as oppose to the central hero turning the legendary fight into some non-existent gender competition. It was extremely frustrating seeing such a marvel being lost in the subtitles! Hence the 3 stars only.
2,Terrible Instructor,"Just finished this workout and did not enjoy Lisa Rinna. She is a terrible instructor. Her count is off from the music, she misses steps which should have been edited out, and she does not even bother to do a mirror image for the camera which means as she is saying use left it appears she is using right. I have been a dance instructor for many, many years and it is common practice and very helpful to your students to reserve your moves to help teach. Because of my experience I was able to follow the routines but I think inexperienced people could be turned around. It is definitely better to watch the back up dancers than Lisa. Fun routines and a decent workout but I didn't find her enjoyable."
4,never mind the blood. here comes the blood car.,"it's 1978 on the swampy space coast of florida. on our dead-end street, near the edge of an alligator infested sugarcane field. an out of place pile of broken cement rests like a jagged grave marker. there was a rumor in the neighborhood that if you stared into a crack in the cement a witch's eye would appear, looking back at you. it was true. sure, there was a puddle of water at the bottom, and you were staring at the reflection of your own eyeball. but when you realized you were the witch, the power solidified in your gut, like a brick of pure dick cheney.you'll get 'round about the same feeling watching archie in blood car."
5,splendid and delicious!,"This book is most excellent to me. I found the ideas most intriguing and the writing is also very good. I like how the author (a Lauri Bortz, lovely) uses funny situations to express much complex ideas in a most intelligent manner, if I can say so by myself.I hope to buy many copies for myself, my many cousins, and other friends, with example.All should read the most splendid plays by a very best writer of our time.I hope this will help your decision in question buying!"
5,"""Already the world seems a bit less bright...""","We could have gone to see him in March in Santa Rosa where the last HBO special was filmed live(and where we saw him a few years back)...Really regretting not going. This set is great, not inclusive but very close. He was pure genius, willing to call the world as it is and never being politically correct. Some may be turned off by the profanity? Then they're missing the point.""Why are we here? Plastic, a**h**e!"" (Jammin' in New York)"
5,Thanks George,"George Carlin creates a persona on stage that is difficult not to love.In real life, He was a gentle man, but on stage he was tough as nails on our hypocrisy as people.I just wanted the little baby who wrote about stand up blasphemy to know that as a comedian myself we are allowed to make fun of whatever we want...so get over it...maybe you can ask Jesus for that funnybone you've always wanted and never gotten...."
1,What a rip-off!,"I only gave it one star because I can't give zero - I ordered two pairs of these, and both had runs immediately, despite that I am very very careful about putting on pantyhose. Total waste of money."
3,Good Service,"I ended up not using this at all. It sits on my bookshelf gathering dust. Nonetheless, the service was quick and the book arrived in great condition!"
5,Metroid,"I have the original cartrige for the NES and now I have the one for GameBoy Advance. Ah, the good old days when I was a kid, I was playing Metroid for the Nintendo. It's a lot better on the GameBoy Advance because the original Nintendo you had to blow on the cartrige and reset the Nintendo just to play the game, that gets annoying after a while, plus if you lose in the game you have to start from the very begining of the stage..."
2,not best condition.,"first track skipped a lot, unplayable. Disc has no marks, looks brand new so maybe recording was off. Very disappointed."
1,Do not waste your money!,This video is a complete waste of money. There are no counts to change movements and the instructors don't seem to know where they're going to start a new move. It's all together a shabby and halfhearted attempt at a workout video.
4,Satisfied,"Good protection, easy to open and close, will hold a couple pairs of earbuds easily. Fine for me for the money."
3,"Too big for the Plugs, great for other stuff","This is quite a bulky item for the Koss plugs, but is just fine for other stuff, like Shure's push-to-play device."
5,Great for every collector,"I collect Monopoly's. So I had to get this one. It's fantastic. Plus since I've bought it, it's gon up in value. Cheers!"
5,The Perfect Monopoly,"This Monopoly is perfect. All of the pieces have a spot for them, when you play with it and when you are not. This tin will last, and you don't have to worry about picking it up when it gets old and haveing all of the money falling out on you."
4,Predictable but Enjoyable 3 1/2 stars,I like pirate stories and this one was so so. Not really a pirate story but a good basic romance story. Someone mentioned My Fair Lady and I guess that would fit. Good characters. Good descriptive writing. I liked Cliff's family a lot. Not to much sex but enough. I guess this is from a series but I have not read any of the other books. I did like the authors writing well enough. Just a good romance that I would recommend you to try.
2,Just don;t get it shipped!!!!!!!!!!,The snapper is cute but I resent having to pay nearly twice the amount that the item originally cost for shipping.
3,"Great glove, but not for hard repetitive work.","I bought these gloves about a weekago. I work in a garage that specializes in tire installations etc...I thought these would be perfect. They fit great. I could type wearing them...lugnuts were no problem. The problem is they wore away on the fingers where i grip things. I'm very surprised the rest of the glove looks brand new. I tried the other mechanix gloves with the padded palms but those are just slightly too bulky, which is unfortunate. Imight try these again but im very leery about them wearing away again.. I might just cut away the fingers, but that seems like a waste to me. Oh well I suppose these gloves would be excellent for things such as raking, maybe gardening, or maybe engine work. But my overall impression it's a very good fitting, tight, workable glove, just don't work them too hard!"
4,Hand Condoms,"Great gloves at a great price. I work on A-10s and needed something to reduce the hand beatings I get on a regular basis. These gloves arrived in record time from Amazon (thanks!). They fit very snugly to my hands (in a good way) and provide excellent dexterity. I am able to do wire repair and pick up coins with no problem.Unfortunately, I was only able to get about two months out of them before a hole developed in the right thumb. It got progressively bigger over the course of a week before I decided to throw them away. Though they are not as durable as I would like them to be, I will be purchasing another pair to give them a second chance."
2,*,The pair I received were poorly stitched. The stitching was not even uniform. The gloves aren't bad but clearly poor QC on Mechanix Wear's end. Check the fingers and stitching when you get them. UPDATE palm and fingers have several holes and cuts in them. I won't buy anymore of these unless the change the material.
3,nice glove.,"i ordered a small and recieved a medium but it is a good thing that i did because the medium fit very well, they are comfortable gloves and they look nice and sleek."
1,"The Orginal is not the ""Orginal"" - Now Smaller and fit differnt","I loved these gloves, they fit my XXL hands just fine and provided good flexiblity and protection. I recently used up my last pair and ordered a bunch more only to find out they have been extensively redesigned.If you liked the Orginals these are no longer them. For one thing they fit much tighter and I would be surprised if they actually sized much more than a XL even though they are selling them as XXL. The long and short of it is that I returned them due to sizing issues. Based on the XXL sixing I would say to order a size up if you want a good fit.Other changes include changed closure and fabric around the thumb and index finger. I do not know if these changes are good or bad as I have not used them but feel the changes to the closure which is now much thicker plastic are bad.Can someone recommend a good glove in XXL to replace this brand."
4,hopalong cassidy the complete tv series,"This was a very wholesome show,there were minimal violence,good humor and always a moral message. William Boyd always focused on the youth, unfortunately that's totally dead today. A positve Role Model is no where to be on television today, I 'm glad to be of that generation when we had people of character gracing our television screens."
4,Happy with my decision,"I searched for several weeks, reading different reviews on Foot Spas and settled on the HomedicsBL-200. The reviews were not steller as each spa had their own likes and dislikes but I am pleased to report that I am very satisfied with my purchase. The water does not stay hot, but by the time it cools off I am ready to move onto something else and the spa is over. The attachments are easy to change out and the storage is great! This Spa is well worth the price and I have been happy with this product since it's first use. I would highly recommend this to anyone that does not have the time or the financial means to go to a salon every week to pamper yourself. You can use this in the privacy of your own home - in your pajamas - watching tv or playing Wii! Either way...you will be glad you own it."
1,homedics BL-200 JetSpa Footbath,I have yet to find a footbath that does what it says its suppose to do. This product is below satisfaction. I fill the footbath with hot water and within ten minutes the water is ice cold. I then have to pour it out and refill it again with hot water and again it turns cold within minutes. This happens with the heat button turned on.
5,Get it while you can,"This is the best leather conditioner on the market. All others have a ""protection"" component in them which leaves a hard, slick, shiny surface which is unpleasant to the touch. This one leaves a soft surface with a natural leather (not vinyl) feel. Hard to find, so get it while you can. Good products like this disappear from the market before you know it."
1,lousy product,"I was very unhappy with this DVD as I expected to recieve a DVD of the excellant tv show of same name, with the actors listed for this. When I let Amazon know how unhappy I was they gave me a complete refund, so although product was bad the service was great and I will continue shopping with them"
4,"Fun Toss Game, Appeals to All Ages but They Don't Get It:)","I bought this for my daughters second birthday to entertain children up to age 5. They like throwing the bags but didn't seem to understand the point system or the other side which is feeding the fish for points. I don't know what age would really try to get a certain score on this game but it was entertaining despite the lack of ""getting it."" I would still buy it again."
1,Backup to where?,"I installed the software intending to use it with an Intel SS4200-E. The application had no trouble providing me with a means to indicate what drives and folders I want to back up. But when it comes time to give it a destination, nothing is presented to me in the GUI. No drive letters, no explorer-like filesystem tree, nothing.Guess it's time to break out rsync..."
1,won't install take 2,Pass over this product if you are looking for a working backup program. Product will not install after entering the super secret pass code that came with the software.
4,Are we talking about the same software?,"I have this software installed on a PC at home and it works great! Easy to install, runs like clockwork. I have used it to restore and it works every time. I backup about 25GB of my 80GB hard driveContrary to what others say it IS possible to pick and choose only certain folders on a hard drive that you want to backup. When you set it up you can choose 1) Backup my entire computer, 2) Let me choose specific files, folders, and drives, 3)Let me choose files by type.I can't comment on support (or lack thereof) because I haven't needed it."
3,"Different than previous books; good, but not great.","I think Walters is a wonderful writer, but this book strays from her classic mysteries and is probably more akin to her previous novel, ""The Breakers."" If you didn't like ""The Breakers,"" you'll probably hate ""The Shape of Snakes."" I wasn't put off by the animal abuse, the psychological abuse and manipulation of women and children, or the violence. I was more intrigued by the structure and execution of the plot. Information is uncovered layer by layer and then I realized that the story is a remembrance and was not happening in real-time. Technically, it's a good book. And as usual, she has excellent character development. Whether or not you'll like them (the protagonist included) is another story. In the final analysis, was it really about revenge, justice, or a way to assuage guilt? Hmmm... :-)"
4,Very gripping but deeply disturbing.,I have to echo the comments of other reviewers about the animal abuse and child abuse in this book. I found the animal abuse especially disturbing. I found myself almost in tears in several sections.If you can make it through the descriptions then the book is worth reading.
4,Ms. Walters Has Written Another Winner,"The plot is absorbing, the characterizations are beautifully drawn, and the format is varied and interesting. Elements of the classic who-and-what-dunit authors are here (most notably duMaurier and Christie) as well as Walters' unique voice and style. Don't be be put off, cat lovers,by the buzz surrounding the graphic descriptions of abuse and cruelty-they consume four pages at most and are necessary to plot and character development.The timelines can be confusing and the author's use of letters,photos, and e-mails to establish first-person voice for several of the characters may annoy those devotees of straight narrative style but it's a tactic that, you'll probably agree, works well. The moral imperative so evident in all of Walters' books is here as well, and stronger than ever, so that ""The Shape of Snakes"" is not only absorbing but inspiring."
5,Air Gear,"I watch this anime online, this anime is awesome. Lot of Bad language, Nudity and also little of boy on boy kissing. The anime is not for kids under 16"
3,There are probably better choices for your needs,"I am normally a huge fan of the Norton Critical Editions, but this one left me disappointed. The contextual materials were excellent and I differ with some of the other reviewers about the introduction and value of the translation (I liked them), but the insanely weak criticism section was a real let down. There has been plenty written about Gilgamesh that could have been included there and I felt this slim volume could really use a bit of breadth in the contemporary views section.If all you want to do is read this wonderful epic, let me recommend Stephen Mitchell's beautiful version. Others have said the Penguin is a good choice and I believe them. This edition would probably be worth it for a person wanting to go deeper into the historical contexts without grappling a great deal with the remainder of the issues, but otherwise it falls kind of flat. I can't quite sort out what audience it was produced for."
1,No Good,I ordered 2 of these units for my kids' rooms. The first one was cracked when I opened the box. The second one had a missing On/Off button. They sent me 2 new ones...First one was cracked from the bottom up and on the second one the screen was pulled out from the unit...definitely a safety hazard for my kids. I have requested a full refund. I won't try another one of these. We'll see what happens!
3,Book,The book came in mint condition and at the specified time. Thank you for your product!I used this book as the text for a human resource/business administration class. It is insightful in the way that it depicts situations into having different influences. It is actually a pretty good read if you are in management.
4,A great read for MPA students and Management of any organization!,"This book is an ideal guide to helping MPA students understand organizational frameworks, leadership, and design.It helps you change your perception of how things are in management the dynamic and politics of the office environment. Definitely ideal for learning about organizational behavior."
5,On time,"The book was in perfect condition, just like how the description said it would be in and it delivered pretty quickly."
5,Great,"I wish, as 007, to have Miss Moneypenny transcribe this review, so that I may tell you, dear readers, that this, perhaps, was my most thrilling adventure. Skiing, impersonation, ...romance, facing my greatest nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (really a silly bloke, despite his dangerousness), gambling in Monte Carlo. It was my privilege to risk my life, and [take down] many men, for the sake of her Majesty, the Queen. I hope you enjoy the narrative of said adventure, and if you will excuse me, Miss Moneypenny is eager to make me my evening martini (shaken, not stirred.) By the way, the name is Bond. James Bond."
3,Not the Bond you know from films,"If your image of James Bond is informed by the films starring Sean Connery (the best movie Bond in my opinion), then this short novel will be a bit of a surprise. Ian Fleming's Bond is of course debonair and an expert pistol shot etc. but also rather easily becomes besotted by the neurotic Tracy and ends up in situations that the cinematic Bond (who's rather more a user of women) would never find himself in. There are long stretches of this novel which are empty of action. Try From Russia With Love for a better Fleming effort."
3,Editing of Kindle version needs to be improved,"This book is one of the best James Bond novels, however the editing on the Kindle version has a number of schoolboy erors. For example there are repeated paragraphs (had to double check to ensure was not going nuts, but they are there) and also all the German umlauts, French accents are all incorrect with wrong letters, in the wrong position. Come on editors, Bond is supposed to be fluent in German and French..."
5,kmw,"I had given up on getting the gunk off of my iron, I had tried everything. I finally went to the store resolved to buy a new iron and I found this product. It worked beautifully! My old iron which had a year-old layered mix of fusible interface, name tag adhesive and who-knows-what-else was clean in minutes. I would recommend wearing an Ov-glove while cleaning the iron. Thanks for a great product!"
3,Simple yet poetic...,Very simple yet poetic storytelling style by the author. It was interesting to see and read the story of one man's dream. Very childlike and reflective of the chinese minimalism in the use of language and illistrations.I would recommend it not highly. It is not a cute fairy tale but it is a lovely simple book that perhaps could inspire young children to follow their dream no matter what their culture or race.*** stars
2,not very good,"This movie was in bad taste, I have most of Day's movies but this one was a loser. Not for kids. It was boring and they could have had a better story line.Dialogue was shabby. No quality to this one."
5,Better than the Brady Bunch,"If you love the Brady Bunch, this is the movie for you. The movie is very real, down to earth, and busy professional people (especially ladies) could identify with the lead character. Although the Brady Bunch shown an unreal, perfect world, this movie pulls you into real, imperfect situations. The pressure to keep up with a successful business, being a mother of three boys, and dealing with society's expectation to also be in a successful relationship and married are brought to light in this entertaining, super-funny comedy. Brian Keith is also great in his portrayal of a professional dealing with his new-found relationship and super-bratty daughter. The good in everyone shines through by the end, leaving the audience not being able to discriminate between tears of laughter and the couple of sentimental tears. Another great Doris Day comedy."
5,Great book!,"I love Bertrice Small! I've read nearly all of her books but I wasn't going to read Lara. I don't like fantasy novels. I thought this book was going to be stupid and filled with a lot of creatures and unrealistic scenes. I'm so glad I changed my mind about reading this book. There are creatures in the book and it is a fantasy novel but Bertrice is such a good writer, she managed to create wonderful characters and a storyline that isn't silly. I liked Lara. I loved reading about her adventures. I really want her and Vartan to stay together forever (I like him a lot) but I have a feeling that's not going to happen *sigh*There are things I didn't like about his book: I got tired of seeing the word ""destiny"" and I hated how Bertrice felt she had to repeat Lara's background over and over. Even though those things bugged me, I will have to give this book 5 stars. I ordered the other two books in this series. I can't wait to read them! Keep writing, Bertrice!"
1,tried,I was so tired of how beautiful lara was we get it i thought it was so stupid when he tells her your beautiful and she says i know take a damn compliment..... The destiny thing got to be way old very fast and i have read almost all of her books skye is my all time fav
4,"solid season, some issues with commercials","The fifth season of South Park is one of the best ones. The humor is still fresh, and the stories are still innovative. We know enough about all the characters so that personality and history play in nicely with the story lines. And there's more Butters. Can't go wrong with that!I don't care for the fact that you are forced to watch commercials at the beginning of the first disk. That's pretty lame of Comedy Central.The extras aren't much extra. However, most of us don't buy these things for the extras and such, so it doesn't matter much."
1,Censorship,"Notice that there is no ""Buy this Season"" button? That's because there are 2 episodes missing. Episode 10 ""How to Eat with Your Butt"" is not listed. I have no idea why. There is an HD version of that episode available.The real tragedy, though, is that episode 3 ""Super Best Friends"" is not listed. Why? Because Mohammed is depicted.Other religious figures are here as well including Jesus, Joseph Smith and Moses, but the episode is not available because of Mohammed.South Park exists to make fun, and they send up everyone. Until now. We have finally discovered the upper bounds of free speech. Just threaten violence and the nation's precious First Amendment becomes optional. It's shameful."
3,WHY NOT SUBTITLES??????,"Great DVD but 3 stars for one reason.I'm a die hard fun of South Park but dew the fact that I'm from Greece, everytime I'm watching it, from Season 3 and after, it's very hard for me to understand the words because there are no subtitles.In season 1 and 2 they had subtitles.I don't understand why they stop doing it!!!!!Please put subtitles from season 6 and afterwards."
5,This is GREAT!,"I couldn't find this movie anywhere. Only here, and i was so happy to. Now getting it was a mistery to me. Was I gona get in good conditions, was it worth the cheap pay. IT WAS!!! Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!What a great movie to find and buy."
3,Good!!!!,"Jason Statham true fan, watch every movie he plays in. Jessica and Chris also good actors I would recommend this movie."
1,Misinformed,"This is completely different from anything you would expect from a film entitled Peter and the Wolf - not so bad, but unexpected. More importantly I can only play it on my PC DVD player not the TV DVD player as I am in South Africa and it is the wrong region for the disc sent!!!!"
3,Good,"This was well done, but it seemed too short. I thought there was more to this story. I was a bit disappointed."
4,"With some effort, made it work","My house was pre-wired for surround sound, and I therefore had j-boxes (kind of like the electrical boxes behind your light switches) at the locations where I'm supposed to mount my speakers. Trick is that these mounts are intended to be attached directly to the wall, and not to j-boxes. I could've saved myself some trouble and purchased the Pinpoint AM20 mounts which are specifically for j-boxes.But I didn't know this at the time, and bought these mounts. I ended up having to attach the mounts directly to the plastic j-box covers to avoid having to drill additional holes in the wall. This worked out great, and I'm pleased with these speaker mounts, but I could've saved myself some trouble by going with speaker mounts specifically intended for my specific scenario."
2,Dissappointing addition to the B5 bookshelf,"I just finished reading Jeanne Cavelos series on the Techno-Mages before reading this series. The difference in quality is amazing. Deep vs. shallow.I read the book, but it had the cheap knock-off feel that so many spin off books have."
4,An unexpected Indie Delight,"Saw this one night on cable and it just kept growing on me. Shot in documentary style, a hapless, clueless guy with something of a foot-fetish is trying to figure out why his girlfriend left and never contacted him again. So he makes this film, his ""message-in-a-bottle"" to try and get her back. Sounds dumb, but it becomes infectious, has a believable storyline, a really interesting cast and an increasingly likeable leading man. Finally, just had to have a copy...recommend a watch...you may wind up liking it as much as I do!"
2,The stripper is useless,"The first attempt I made at stripping some RG6, the blade on the stripper moved out of it's proper position and I can't get it back. The crimp tool seems to work reasonably well."
5,Great kit for a beginner,"After reading the brief directions, it took me less than 5 minutes to install a new connector onto my coax cable. I would highly recommend!"
5,AMAZING!,"This product is absolutly amazing. This extends the life of any cat litter. It just eats up the odor making the cat box smell as fresh as the day you put new litter in. It doesn't take alot to get the job done, one bottle lasted me over a year and a half. I highly recommend this to any cat lover and I know my cat would too."
5,REO Speedwagon Wheels Are Turnin' video,"I have been wanting this video for a long time. I was hoping for a DVD release but gave up on that. The concert is in my hometown of Kansas City, one of REO's strongholds. The fans are great, the energy and enthusiasm onstage are-as always- unmatched, and the off-stage footage is priceless. (I didn't know I would get to see Kevin, Gary and Bruce in their underwear. :) The best part, though, is getting to hear REO performing songs that they don't do in concert anymore. REO has been my favorite band for over 30 years, but I never got to see them live until 2007. This video gives me a chance to experience a little of what I missed all those years."
2,LOVE THE SIZE...BUT IT STICKS!!,"I bought my first re-designed pan for just over $6 in a local grocery store. I used it maybe 3 to 5 times a week to make what amounts to an egg sandwich like at McDs. The size is perfect and the first couple weeks were great...the egg never stuck and I used EVOO Pam. The sandwiches were great and I thought I'd finally found my pan. I use a very small rubber coated spatula which is perfect. Well, after the 2nd week the sticking started and it's now gotten to the point that it sticks all the time no matter what I do to protect against it. So, the pan has a life of roughly 2 weeks of non-stick use and about a month and a half of sticky use until you just can't take it anymore.Since the pan was roughly $6 I just bought another today to see if the experience repeats itself. Overall, I can't recommend it even with the re-design."
2,"Works, but kind of useless.","So I got this pan as a present. It's cute as a button and is made of solid materials. First the pros. It's not top of the line in terms of non-stick, but with a little butter it's pretty good. It heats evenly despite its size and mostly works. OK now the bad. The handle weighs more than the pan so it won't sit flat all the time. You have to wedge it and mess with it a LOT. Also, it's too small to fit a full size spatula in, so unless you have a mini one (like for pastries) don't count on flipping your egg. Now the worst part, the handle is ceramic, a great conductor of heat. Meaning you will burn yourself if you touch the handle without a glove. Do yourself a favor, spend a bit a more and get a good non-stick frying pan. This thing is now a cute Kitchen wall hanging for me."
1,Don't buy this thing for any price.,"Well, I picked one of these up at a thrift store. It looked to be unused. Now that I've used it, I bet that it was used exactly once and then donated.Nonstick? Nope. I've used cooking spray in conjunction with low heat and this thing holds onto my eggs extra tight. Flipping your egg? Difficult. Burning yourself on the handle? A certainty.There's no reason at all to buy this thing. Move along."
1,Cute but Useless,"This was an impulse buy for me and a mistake it was. Barely large enough to fry one small egg; will stick if no oil is added; will overflow if a jumbo egg egg is used with some oil; will tip over easily since the handle is heavier; handle gets too hot to handle without a mitten; the paint on the egg head will melt if the handle gets too hot (and get smeared on the mitten). Totally impractical, save your money, please."
1,Eggs Stick Every Time,"Don't waste your money or aggravation. Although this tiny little pan caught my eye at Bed Bath & Beyond because it seems just right for one person and one egg -- and it's small and fairly heavy weight -- the ""non stick"" surface it appears to have, is anything but non stick. If you've ever had an egg stick to a metal pan, this is what you'll experience. It's alot of hard work to get it clean. Even with cooking sprays or adding water -- the egg sticks and is not worth the aggravation. I don't understand why a manufacturer would go to the trouble of making such a nice little pan, and drop the ball on the cooking surface!"
1,This thing stinks,Not worth buying - you'll just want to throw it away. The non-stick is non-existent and its too small for even one egg to be flipped well. Also not a good pan thickness for eggs.
2,Poor Quality,Had this for a year. Worked okay with much non-stick spray but fell apart yesterday in a crumbled mess of broken plastic.
2,"Not the worst purchase ever, but...","Negatives:-Eggs don't cook all the way through-Difficult to flip eggs because spatulas don't fit-Teflon surface continues to wear away (started only after a few uses)-End up with more of a scrambled egg than one fit for a sandwichPositives:-Gets the job done, just not easilyIn all, I imagine most mini pans have these problems except for the cheap Teflon. The only reason I didn't give it only one star is because it does cook."
4,Egg Pan,"This is my second pan. The non-stick coating doesn't last as long as I would like but this little pan is perfect for making my own low calorie Sausage Egg and cheese ""McMuffin"" in the morning. I will buy another one when the coating goes on this one. But I wish they'd make it last longer."
1,"Like the little chicken says ""cheap cheap cheap"".","I got this as an xmas gift, I was very excited, just what I was looking for, a pan to cook just ONE egg in! Wonderful! Right?.... Wrong. This this is SO cheap. I made ONE, count them, ONE egg in this thing, and when I went to clean it, the non-stick coating had already started to come off. I tossed it out. Not worth it. I'm going to buy a mini-cast iron pan instead."
2,Disappointed,"Though this ring is nice to look at ... it did not hold up. The ring broke into three pieces on the second day. My son simply went to put the ring on. He had not dropped it or hit it in anyway. Could be that is was defective on arrival, but when you have to pay for shipping, it can get costly."
4,Beginning of a great night's sleep.,"I suffer from lower back pain and, at times, nothing I do or take will relax my back in order for me to have a night of rest. I purchased the Massaging Body Mat as a ""no pill"" fix and it works. When my back is really sore, I lay on the mat for 20 to 30 minutes before going to sleep and I feel relaxed, looking forward to a good night's sleep. It does take me a while to get correctly positioned, but the end result is worth it."
4,"A useful handbook, but not helpful for NPDP exam","I bought this book for NPDP (new product management professional) exam preparation. After reading the first halp I discover it might not create direct benefit, then I stopped.It's more about advance topics, apprepriate for those who are already a product manager or those running a new product development projects. For those who's objective is to pass the exam, they may feel disappointed, however, for NPDP certificate holders, this book will definitely enhance your knowledge and view."
3,A Brief Lesson In Crime,Some of the songs are pretty quality but they are really short. The longest song on the album is not even 3 minutes. And on top of all that there is only 7 songs on the album.
3,Meh. Its alright,"Huh. Everyone's raving about this 16 minute ""album"" like its the second coming of Christ. I mean, it doesn't suck. But at best it's just pretty good. I picked up TPC a few days ago and basically if you've heard The Strokes, Editors, or Bloc Party you've pretty much heard everything on here. Only they did it better. I think the most interesting thing about Tokyo Police Club is their name.But I will get to see them live next month so maybe they can rock me into obedience in person. And live up to that name."
1,DONT BUY THESE,Please do not but these sand paper letters. I bought them back in december for my son. I just brought them out to give to him for his 3rd birthday. The glue used to adhere the sand to the letters is completely toxic. There is an awful smell emiting from the cheap paper cards. I have them sitting next to me in a ziplock bag and I can still smell them. The toxic oder is giving me an instant headache and stomach nausea.
2,Out of Date,"I purchased this book awhile back, but left it laying on the shelf. Started reading it this past week. Covers the material fairly well, but the digital camera has advanced since this writing. Also I found it to be very general with little to no get in their face type information.I have not gotten much from this book."
5,Long lasting,"We've had these for 5 years now, and they're still like new. Love them. I wish they were machine washable, but nothing high quality is."
4,The versatility of jazz clarinet,I enjoyed the compilation of 25 tracks featuring the jazz clarinet in tunes mainly between the mid twenties and early forties. They reflected the versatility of the instrument and the breadth of clarinet styles giving a good flavour of the music of the time. The notes on the individual tracks were exellent and they included names of all the players as well as the clarinetist - good for cross reference. A good buy! JC
4,Engaging and Thorough,I found this book be a nice read. The overall plot was kind of common (Past catches up with bad guy turned good) but the details really made it enjoyable for me. I REALLY appreciated the continuity of the story and thoroughness in how Walter managed the characters and the timeline from start to finish.Nice Job. I'll pass it on to my friends.
4,Unique Detective Story,"Citizen Vince is has a unique plot lot -- with the back story being an American's chance to take part in the democratic system. This is set against set a whodunit story that works most of the time. The thing I enjoyed most about the book was the ""voice."" The author has the ability to engage the reader in a clever manner -- without going past that invisible boundary in which lousy humor overshadows the story.Worth a read, and I donated it to my local library so others can enjoy."
4,Bad Boy in the Dark,"Though this book is pretty uneven, there are about a dozen masterpieces in it that I will return to over and over again. ""Elegy"", ""The Bridge"" and ""Quasimodo"" (...) are especially beautiful and memorable.Most of the poems are in syllabics, so they never come off as artificial. Organic but structured, they have a deep resonance about them that reminds this reader a little of the poems of Dylan Thomas.I'll give him 4 stars, as many of the poems in this collection should have been omitted."
1,This single pisses me off!,Why in the hell are Love II Infinity and Track Masters remixes radio edits? I thought the purpose of a Maxi single was for long versions. This single focuses more on the Hip-Hop genre with all the Hip-Hop remixes but those who like club mixes get screwed for their money.One plus side for this pathetic excuse for a Maxi cd single is that there is the Frankie Knuckles remix for Rock With You in all it's 7:45 of glory! The Hani remix for Earth Song is halved. That sucker clocks in at over 14 minutes long.Grrrrrrrrr!
5,It's the best when you know how to use it,"The previous reviewer (who wrote that the Guide is not in English) apparently didn't understand that there is a key in the front of the book and also on a bookmark that explains all of the easily understood symbols with regard to credit cards, parking, elevator, air-conditioning, etc. This is essentially a catalogue of the best hotels and restaurants, along with locator maps. It's terrific. Also, look for the ""black car"" symbol. If you happen to be staying in a place with the black car symbol, just showing the Michelin Guide (must be for the current year) will get you one free night in the garage. That savings alone will probably be more than the cost of the book. If you feel like splurging, look at the maps in the front for the 1-, 2-, and 3-star restaurants and for the 4- and 5-peak hotels. If you want more modest places, they're listed too."
3,Shrunk in the Mail,"Portmeirion Botanic Garden Tea Cup and Saucer, Set of 6They are considerably smaller than the set i purchased in England ... i think maybe 6 ozs rather than 12 ozs. And obviously the saucers are smaller too.I kept the product but was greatly disappointed. The cup size should be printed, and in fact they cost more than the larger ones. The price was high in general, as i found them cheaper in a store near home.Internet shopping learning curve for me indeed."
1,Worked great while it lasted...,"Died on me after less than a month! Can't figure out what went wrong: nothing burned, broken, etc ... very cheap and unreliable :("
5,Awesome deep fryer!,"I love this deep fryer. After receiving it, I deep fried everything in it.It is unfortunate that you cannot remove the oil holder and wash it out. It does make it a little harder to clean, but w/e. It works awesome. I will definitely have this for years to come."
2,Once I opened these I realized that I'd had (and stopped buying) them before,"I loves me some garlic, in fact I consider it a food group, but it's not appealing in this product. Three tablets are needed for the labeled amount of lysine -- consider that when comparing prices to other formulations. Even when I swallow quickly the stale dried garlic taste and smell lingers."
5,Excellent,I had never heard of this product. I could tell I had more energy right away. I would highly recommend trying it..
5,Smooth Transaction,"As always, this item showed up quickly and was exactly as described on Amazon. I use it as an extra defense mechanism against over-sensitivy on my lips to the sun....(i get blisters if they aren't protected ever since my deployment to Iraq) I'd highly recommend this product."
3,Kinda,"Ok, your skin (and coochie) are gonna dry up pretty bad, but this product will prevent breakouts.. six an one, half a dozen of the other"
3,Not the best Exam Cram book I have read,"My biggest issue with this book was the layout and chapter organization. They were organized as if this book was meant to teach some information instead of review the information. Some topics had depth while others were glazed over, regardless of how important they were on the exam. This will probably be corrected on the 2nd edition of this text.For those that do not know, the 70-240 exam is NOT one big exam. It is four shorter exams taken all in one sitting. If you fail any of the four parts, you fail the exam. This book failed to mention this fact in the introduction, where it describes the test types and formats."
1,It has a mind of its own,"Ours also worked very well for about 10 minutes. Then, with nobody running the controls or even around it, it started running again. Perhaps our house is haunted and a ghost wanted a massage? I don't trust it."
5,for the Knot Queen,"Well, you either love it or you hate it. I am one that needs a lot of pressure to get my stress knots out of my back (especially on the side of my shoulder blade). My husband and some of my friends yelped when they used it, but they do not need the pressure that some need to get the tension relieved. It's kind of a love-hate. If it hurts but it's a ""good hurt,"" this is the chair for you!"
4,Almost as good as a touch massage.,"The sbm300 is powerful and handy. The only problem is it shuts off after a certain length of time. I restart it and off I go to the sublime again. Of course if it didn't shut off, I would never shut it off. It is so powerful that I sometimes overdo it. So enjoy but when it shuts off don't turn it on again until the next day. Allow your muscles to heal or you will be sore. Imagine: Soreness from a massage. I can live with that. It is a back massager and does not do the neck. I truly recommend this series. The 200 is not even close and the 400 is only fancier so don't waste your money."
4,buy it ...stop being a penny pincher,"amazon gave me the best price , i must admit, and the product works great.i'm actually using it now. good product for the money , fits in almost any chair...good to use when surfing the net....buy it...it's good for you. i have no banking or financial relationship with amazon or homedics for full disclosure....."
1,HoMedics SBM-300,"I removed shipping screw as per instructions. Worked for about 10 minutes then would not shut off. Unit would hum and stop, hum and stop, but power light would stay on. After about 20 minutes something smelt burnt and that was all she wrote.Now it won't turn on. I returned it and am waiting to see what the factory does."
5,Homedics SBM-300 Shiatsu Plus Massaging,"WOW, I had the other and took it back because you couldn't pause the rollers to work on a spot. This one is like having your own professional Massager in your own home. I have had it now for a month or so and it has been used many a times by many people and I have had no problems with it. Plus this one has the viberator on the seat a nice additive to have."
5,Love it,I look at about 9 different types of Shiatsu massaging cushions before I purchased this item. I purchased this for my husband who has back problems. He has used it daily and loves it. We have had no problems and are very happy with this purchase.
5,"Sherlock Holmes, Complete Granada TV Series","A wonderful TV series featuring the best Sherlock Holmes ever, Jeremy Brett; relative was thrilled to receive this series as a gift."
5,sherlock holmes jeremy brett,"I purchased this remarkable collection several months ago after having watched the program on television. Jeremy Brett is,to me, my wife and all my friends the most fitting actor to portray Sherlock Holmes. We have all read the 56 stories and 4 novels and believe J.B.s perfomances fulfill all the characteristics as written by Doyle. J.Brett has clearly studied every word and has painstakingly played the roll to perfection. Being commercial free adds to the joy of watching. Amazon.com. offered the best price for this set and the ease of purchase and quick delivery will make me a returning customer."
4,Jeremy Brett IS sherlock holmes,I give this series the highest marks.No treatment of Sherlock Holmes has ever approached this level of quality.The rich period details and lavish sets ring true in every chapter.Jeremy Brett is unsurpassed in his portrayal of Holmes.David Burke and Edward Hardwicke are both excellent Watsons.This series is a must have for Sherlock fans.
3,"Nice, but strange fold in material","We own about 3 dozen Portmeirion plates, bowls, cups, etc. We love them -- they are both pretty and sturdy.This butter dish was pretty, but had a weird ""fold"" in the material near the top handle. It looked like either two pieces of material had been bonded together poorly, or had cracked underneath the glaze. We ended up sending it back."
5,Great classic throwback,I got this for my kids because I remember playing the classic version long ago and so I wanted them to experience the fun I had with it. I am glad I found it. My kids enjoy it.
3,The only Zelda game that I didn't finish,"I have been a fan of Zelda from day one. All the games and all the platforms. But I found this one to be intensely irritating and that is not something I look for in a game. It can be ridiculously difficult to get to some of the palaces and with only three lives and few if any fairys or towns to recharge at it gets real old real fast. The so called Vally of Death to get to the final palace was the last straw for me. If you like repetition, then this is the game for you but I can find better things to do with my time."
3,remake,"To be fair I haven't seen this movie as yet but I will. What I want to know is why can't I find the orginal anywhere. Not it books or assorted film sites. The orignal was called Escape from Colditz. It may have been a made for tv movie but it was excellant. It was on TV like 30 years ago. The only one I remember who was in it was David Mc Callium from the Man from Uncle. Charles Bronsan may have, I do know they were together in The Great escape. I would love to find this orignal. I hope this version is near as good."
2,"""Inaudible"" dialogue","Why would anyone release a movie in 2007 without closed captioning? The market for this movie is most likely to be WWII veterans, most of whom are now hard of hearing, and there are no subtitles! And turning up the volume didn't help because the accents are incomprehensible to Americans. Britain is so small that I suppose viewers there on the ""telly"" had no trouble understanding the ""quaint"" dialects of the actors because these are heard on the streets of London everyday, but not so in the US. The music also drowned out what might have been intelligible. I never did watch the second part because without audible dialogue I couldn't follow the story."
1,"Pass on this one, folks.","What a bore! There were so many typos in this book that I almost didn't finish it. What a bunch of sappy, self absorbed characters. You find yourself rooting for Joe Green. Let's get rid of all the saps! And the characters names...Silke Saybrooke for petes sake! Don't waste you time."
1,Shallow coverage of HRM,"I realize that this book is for ""Idiots"", but come on. Shallow coverage of HRM. I can't believe the author reviewed his own book and gave himself 5 stars. He's not biased at all. Not worth the money."
1,Just for some balance,"Wasn't going to write a review of this, but I felt compelled. The author gave himself 5 stars for a book that I felt was a waste of my money. If you have any higher education or management experience, you need to look elsewhere. If you truly are an ""idiot"" it might be a good starting point for you. Why would a true idiot need a HRM book, though?"
5,The best translation by far.,"The best method to study the Qur'an is of course to study the Arabic language since it is a complex language. However, reading Abdullah Yusuf Ali's translation is a very good place to start. I have the translation of the Qur'an by other authors, none came close to the excellent work by this author.Abdullah Yusuf Ali's translation of the Qur'an comes with the Arabic text alongside with the English translation. It is faithful to the text, and the commentary accompanying the text is well written and balanced.This translation is long regarded as the best book to consult by most Muslims."
2,Not what I expected,"What I wanted was a modern translation of the Qur'an that was easy to read and understand. What I got was a translation full of ""thees and thous"" that reads from the back to the front, more than a little disconcerting to a non-Muslim. My intention was to attempt to understand the Muslim religion as it truly is, without any politically-correct ""spin"" put on the text. The fact is, to get the true meaning, one must be able to read the text in the original language, Arabic. My quest for understanding will unfortunately wind up in my rather large ""unfinished book"" pile."
3,Altered from the Beirut edition,"The footnotes and commentary have been altered from the 1937 Beirut edition. That's the version to get your hands on, which is not possible but it might be somewhere online. Amazon lists the book but of course doesn't offer it: [...]"
2,"Reviewing the quality of this edition, not the Quran itself.","I bought this edition some months ago from Amazon.com and for most purposes it is a fine edition however it has many printing errors and typographical errors. letters left out (for example 'lood' where 'blood' is obviously intended). The paper is rather thin, so you see the printing on the backing page when you are reading, this can be distracting.It is well bound, and the print quality is good. On the whole it is a good production but the publishers need to do a much better job of proof-reading before they go to the presses."
4,Battle of Hastings,This book is very helpful for anyone interested in this very significant event in the history of England. The author is a superb authority of this period of time.
3,Too large for headphones,"According to the product description, this case (well made & solid) is far too large to be useful for storing my new KSC75 earphones. I could probably fit 3 pairs of the earphones in the case. I was hoping for something I could tuck into a carry bag. I have written to Koss asking if another of the cases would be more suitable, but they haven't responded."
3,Too big.,"I'll agree with the reviewer who said this case was sturdy but way too big for the headphones it claims to match. I haveKoss KSC9 Sportclips, which are mentioned in this case's list of supported Koss headphones. However, taking into account the reviews saying this case (""Case C"") was too big, I also bought""Case D"", the next size down. Case D fits my headphones almost perfectly -- a little on the snug side, but providing for a much more portable way to store my 'phones."
4,Handy little pouch,"Although the zipper is less than perfect, this is handy. It not only holds the Koss KSC75 headphones, there's room for my slim MP3/ MP4 player as well. This makes it easier to keep it protected when doing physical activities. Could be improved with a clip to attach to clothes if you don't wear a belt, though. It's made in China, so that's a minus."
2,Too Large,The case was much larger than it appears. It is more elongated that the picture seems to show. I returned it.
2,Okay,"This movie was just a so-so movie, however, it had Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones so it was still worth watching."
2,Bad headphones,"These headphones are not very good at all. First, they do not stay on my ear at all. Just walking one inch of the ground or turning around, they will fall off. The sound quality is pretty good, though I've seen better. I guess you can say they are portable too. Overall, I'd not get these or other clip phones, they fall off too easy. Just get lightweight headphones, like the UR5 and the MDR101LP. Or, get closed headphones like the UR15C or the MDRV150. They stay on your ear and have the same or maybe better sound quality than these."
4,Excellent book.,"It's the bible for Perforce. I do find everything also documented in the Perforce User's Guide, but this book is nice and succinct and well laid out."
5,Comprehensive Reefkeeping Information,"Excellent book. There is quite a bit of information for the reefkeeper from novice to advanced. Covers water quality , aquascaping, plumbing, equipment, lighting, water movement, feeding and more in depth. I wish I had read this volume before starting my first tank. It would have saved me a lot of money, time and frustration."
1,unbelievably bad range - 1 meter/3 feet max in open air,"The range on this product is a bad joke.Trying to use this product with an HTPC. The mouse is incapable of receiving or broadcasting through the chassis even. In other words it won't move if the dongle is plugged in the back and the mouse is right in front. To say nothing of sitting on the couch 6 feet away of course. The keyboard seems to be able to be understood through the chassis of the computer but move 6 inches further away and forget it.When I plug the dongle into a female USB cable and bring it to the coffee table, I can measure its actual range in open air, with no obstructions. Let's see. The range of this ""30 meter"" product is exactly:28 inches.Yup, just over two feet in open air.Great work on the engineering, Kensington. You have made an utterly useless wireless Mouse/Keyboard combo."
2,This thing was almost awesome.,"I liked this mouse and keyboard so much that I recommended it to a new co-worker who sits right next to me. All of a sudden, my mouse/keyboard didn't work when she was using hers...they interfere with each other. I called Kensington tech support and it turns out they're on the same frequency with no way to change it. You have to be 30 feet away from each other to avoid interference. How annoying is that?"
1,So Disappointed,"I was so disappointed with this slow cooker. The first time I used it, it burned a tried and true recipe within an hour."
5,Great CD,"You won't regret buying this CD. This artist has appeared with her music on Felicity, thats where I first heard her. This is a great CD, I love it!"
5,"Excellent ""real science"" fiction","Besides developing a compelling plot and complete characters, Hogan (who was a scientist himself before becoming a writer) dreams up very plausible scenarios based on believable, though fictional, science. You find yourself nodding your head and thinking, ""it could happen.&quot"
4,Great Mix of Science and Sci-Fi,"I was introduced to James Hogan by reading ""Inherit the Stars."" Then I read the rest of this volume (2 other books.) I really enjoy Hogan's ability to take a scientific theory and weave it into a story. He gives you enough puzzles to think about as he writes and keeps the story line moving. If you enjoy Sci-Fi that is not just one fantastic creature after another, but is built around a plausable story line, then you will enjoy Hogan.The first book was written in the late 70's, so some of the politics have changed. As Arthur Clarke said in one of his books, this story happens in this solar system, but not in this universe."
4,Easy to read,I loved how this book was written. You can read cover to cover or go to the question that you need answered. A must have resource for all catholics.
1,The worst robotic pool cleaner we have owned,"We bought our Water Tech Blue Pearl RBUS3BP last summer and only used it a few times. When we got it out to use this summer it runs a short time and then stops. When turned off, wait, and turn back on it starts again, but will only run for a few seconds. We are definitely not happy with it and have reverted to using our old AquaBot which is no longer perfect, but runs better than the Blue Pearl."
3,A great voice always,"Indudablemete Sandro es uno de los grandes, entre los grandes cantantes latinoamercanos de los '60s. Hay dos maneras de comentar este ejemplar. Si usted gusto de Sandro en aquel tiempo y prefiere el sonido original, encontrara todas estas melodias muy diferentes. Si usted es un nuevo admirador, los arreglos aqui expuestos seran de su agrado, aunque se dejan por fuera tantas otras melodias que fueron muy populares. El titulo y fotografia hacen creer que son las canciones originales y en realidad son nuevas versiones, le doy 3 estrellas."
1,"Oh, puhleeze","If you want decorating ideas, do not buy this book. If you want to see a puff piece about the author and too many pictures of her, then this is for you. I have not heard of this author, and I don't care to know anything about her. I just want a good decorating book. This is the kind of vanity book that authors should have to pay to publish (and then give to their friends for free). No attempt should be made to sell this piecie of trash to consumers like me who are are on the lookout for cool decorating ideas."
5,Maiden heist,"I really enjoyed this film, because I think it's soo funny when older people think that this is a out. Lol"
3,"THEY AREN'T YOUNG, BUT THEY ARE TALENTED!","WE ENJOYED THIS DVD, I ADORE ALL THREE OF THESE MEN EVEN THOUGH THEY AREN'T EXACTLY IN THEIR 30'S! THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE HAVING A BLAST MAKING THE MOVIE AND I GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR STILL LIKING WHAT THEY DO AFTER ALL THEIR COMBINED YEARS IN THE BUSINESS. I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT FOR MY VIDEO COLLECTION."
4,Smooth Heavy Duty Faucet,I just had this installed and I have never used a faucet so smooth as this one! It feels like solid brass beneath the nickel finish. This product's only flaw so far is that the nickel finish does not match the rest of the Stainless Steel parts on my sink. This is why it does not get a 5 star rating from me. I am a bachelor and don't care about matching metal colors. I am impressed with its quality and value here on Amzn.
4,Satisfied,Rolling Stone comes twice a month which is a big plus. I like the covers and also the articles. I don't agree with all of their music selections and recommendations but it is a good way to find out about bands you might not have heard of otherwise.
5,Everyone needs to read this book!,"I picked up Reflections of Heaven and couldn't put it down. Peter Shockey captures God's fundamental truths along with universal law and relates both to the growing spirituality of the individual and collective as we approach the coming of the new millenium. Similar to Conversations with God and Talking to Heaven: Messages from a Medium, Reflections is an incredible stepping stone and guidepost on the path to enlightenment. Shockey documents actual occurences from the angelic realm and writes in a highly intelluctual and intelligent manner so that even the most skeptical of critics can not deny overwhelming proof and evidence that we live in a spiritual world. I recommend everyone to read this book,and guarantee you will come away with a new knowledge of profound truths, and better understanding of God, the world we're living in, and yourself. This is a wonderful, wonderful book you will want to read again and again!"
5,Full of Hope!,"This book is a wonderful read for those who are constanly seaking the truth about matters of faith, afterlife, and what is beyond death.After you read it you will have more reasons to believe and have hope and you will be convinced that we are not alone in this world.It is a comforting book, I truly recomend it, it is a must read especialy for those who are grieving and mourning the loss of a loved one."
4,"Good clamps, better service",I bought 10 of these clamps in the past few years. As one reviewer noted the pig iron broke while in the midst of a glue up. I called the company and the clamp heads that are silver in color are defective and they replaced all the heads for free. The newer ones are black and I have 2 of those and they have stood up well to everything I threw at them. I have to admit Bessy makes a top notch clamp and I have been replacing the Jorgensens one by one when they break. 4 stars for an american product that probably deserves a 1. Customer service wins the day here.
3,Packaging is misleading,"Love the Movers, but it says in the text that bad hair day and unparty are part of the dvd and those episodes are not featured. Disappointing for my son who loves the bad hair day one."
4,toddler heroin--in a good way,"our 2.5 yr old grandson loves this & the other ""movers"" videos...the music is well-crafted, the messages very positive, & he can watch, mimic, dance, sing endlessly, tho we sometimes need to tell him that even the Movers need to rest a bit.Overall a very positive experience for youngsters"
1,Yikes.,"The only thing this product helped me do is realize that a rack like this is a great idea for my garage. Unfortunately, as soon as I put the 3rd bike in it the thing became totally unstable and threatened to tip over. So I have to buy another (well built) rack, and trash this thing. I can't even bring myself to sell it on eBay, because I know the person who I sell it to will be as disappointed as I was. AVOID THIS PRODUCT -- DO NOT BUY -- GET SOMETHING ELSE."
2,It doesn't cancel noise,"I have not used these for playing music. I was looking for a way to block expressway traffic noise while trying to read. The ""white noise"" sounds similar to traffic and seems to aggravate the traffic noise distraction."
2,philips noise cancelling headphones,"I'm very disappointed with the performance of this product. I could have had a pair of headphones for a lot less money than I paid for something I thought was going to cancel noise. At the very best, it minimizes noise but I am still able to hear all that is going on around me, voices, equipment running, walking on floors, doors opening and closing, phones ringing, etc. This product is not effective in its intended purpose which is to ""cancel noise"". I would not buy another one of these or recommend them to any one."
3,Just All Right,"These noise-canceling phones are comfortable enough, and I like the large hard case supplied, along with the smaller accessory-holding case inside, attached by velcro.Noise-canceling is effective. But the sound at the extremes of bass and treble could be more extended; the bass, especially, lacks definition compared with my in-ear buds, the Shure E3c's.Not the ultimate but worth the price."
4,A charming translation,"I wonder under what circumstances the previous reviewer read this book which caused him to so dislike it. This book is not boring in the slightest. It is a charming account of occurences in Versailles full of delightful tidbits and snippets of interesting facts, such as an incident in which Louis XIV's hat caught fire. Besides being a joy to read in its dated translation from French, this book is highly informative, especially on less common facts. I particularly recommend this to those with busy schedules, as its short length leaves one feeling educated and able to easily converse on the subject without having to try to find time to plow through pages and pages."
2,This Book is BORING,"This book portrays a sense of ""Wow, my life has just been wasted while reading this book."" The main purpose for this book is to inform students about the devolpment of the city of Versailles, and it does that very well, but in a rather boring way. I believe this book should be burned."
1,Waste of time,"The author continually repeats obvious points, offering few interesting or useful points. Don't waste your time."
2,Horrible book.,"I cannot put into words how bad this book was, and how the author should just stop writing all together. Do not buy this piece of garbage."
4,I like it.,"I like this audio cd of the book feel the fear and do it anyway. I heard it a few times while driving. Very Interesting, good ideas."
3,Basic information,"The take home message I got from this book is when facing the unknown just go for it and tell yourself ""I'll handle it."" That phrase helps in clearing our vague, self-imposed obstacles of what the future may bring from our actions. The book was overall okay. I like books that tell it more raw and not so polished. This book is polished."
3,Great Book to Read; Concepts to Embrace,"Get yourself on a new path this year. Embrace change in your life; overcome intertia. The time is now to open yourself to a bold conclusion: I will do whatever it takes to make a change in my life. When you really internalize that belief, great things happen. This book will help you on your new journey.- GiddyupGuy"
1,Inane and uninteresting,"I don't usually write a review unless I read the entire book. However, this writer postulates ideas so hacknied it was impossible to stick with it. I ended up skipping over repetitive, tiresome platitudes trying to find something to save the book. However, Jeffers seriously lost me with three items: this idea that everyone with a life-threatening illness is duty-bound to make it a ""positive, learning experience""; the constant referral to ""spirit"", Higher Self and other metaphysical ideas and trying to pass them off as not being religious and therefore applicable to anyone; and lastly her use of the psudoscience of applied kinesiology.Don't waste your time on this one. If you must read it go to the library. It's seriously lame!"
5,Life changeing!,"I would like to really thank the author of this book, because it changed a lot in my life. By reading it and doing the exersizes, I've really got a better handle on my fears, and many of them are now gone! I look forward to doing new things, because even though I feel fear when I do something unknown, I now see it as a challenge, and can't wait to do it! What a difference!I would recomend it to everyone! Do not let this book go you by!"
5,Great,"Bought this for my 6 year old and he really hasn't complaint about any issues with it. The only thing negative was the long wait for delivery, but then it came and well it was worth the wait I suppose."
1,Faulty Memory Card,"Bought the 64 MB Version to save all of my MGS3; Subsistence data including the camo downloads which are about 1MB each. After I saved about 11 MB on the card it started to corrupt my data and would not save or be recognized by the PS2. Complete waste of time and money. You're better off with a NYKO memory card, they haven't failed on me yet."
2,The Wrong Memory Card,"I have this memory card. After I have saved about 8 mb on it I try to save something on it but it keeps on saying ""Save Failed"" ""Save Failed"" ""Save Failed"" ""Save Failed"". It has been driving me crazy and that is why I am buying a new memory card right this second."
5,A Dangerous Time in Colonial America,"Wow! What a book! For anyone interested in studying the French and Indian War period, this is a must read. Although it's not a ""textbook"" account it's still a lot of fun. I would read this book alongside Francis Parkman's ""Montcalm and Wolfe"" and Anderson's ""Crucible of War"". Probably Mr. Eckert's best work. It's really great for younger children or anyone who has forgotten about good old-fashioned American folklore. Fantastic!"
3,A draw back,"I know this is a great season, but however the DVD set has a drawback, it's not going to include the Jim Walsh special which was aired prior to the Simpsons season 7 opener, for the special recap on the Who shot Mr. Burns? episode."
4,Great show,Great show and now you can buy season 7. I want to buy season 1-6 when I got the money for it. But why can?t they release all the seasons in a super box.
1,Book Leaves You Hanging - Plus I Believe the Reviewers are Biased,"The book is basic , not very comprehensive and long on self-importance instead of a true ""how-to"". I agree with other reviewers who remarked that Corbett is selling an introduction to his consulting firm.I bought the book to find out what I didn't know and to get direction on how to either learn it or do it. Corbett prefers to leave you hanging, perhaps to engage his consulting firm, but I think more than not, its just an incomplete work on outsourcing management.The points are interesting, but they're nothing you haven't read over and over in newspapers and business journals. Its a quick read that delivers little substance for the working manager.I see that alot of his cronies have offered their solicited opinions also here on his book. An an ex-IBM'er in procurement who is acquainted with the firm's actual project outcomes - I will share with the readers here that these reviewers are not objective."
5,New Ideas I Didn't Find Anywhere Else,"As a practitioner with responsibility for strategic outsourcing at my financial services company, my colleagues look to me for new ideas and ways to leverage outsourcing as a management tool.This book introduced ideas I hadn't seen anywhere else, especially in Chapter 4: A New Outsourcing Value Model.The methodology for tying outsourcing more closely to our company's strategy was very helpful. The expanded financial model that considers flexibility, acceleration, innovation along with more traditional business factors has helped sharpen our focus. Other ideas like Zero-based Sourcing have given us new ways of thinking about and communicatng our outsourcing plans.This is an important book to read if you have strategic responsibility for outsourcing at your company, or if you advise others."
1,hypocritical,"If Corbett thinks outsourcing is so great, why has he moved his own call center people back to the US? I read this book, then consulted other business people who made the move to India. Like a past reviewer noted 1 in 3 outsourcing projects fail. Don't let Corbett lead your firm on a costly gamble that could wreck you."
2,Not sturdy enough for 2 people!,was not big enough or sturdy enough for 2 people (kids; weighing less than 100 lbs each)! would not recommend for use other than in a pool!
4,800 paces to Hell: Andersonville,"I found this book to be extremely indepth with information and loved reading it but I have to admit that to the casual reader it may be a bit difficult to read. I found Dr.Lynn's devotion to actual accounts incredible in the fact that many seem to contradict each other. Dr Lynn has shown that many of our historical records indeed do have a biasness to them, and much of our history is clouded by prejudices of both sides. Read the book and decide for your self"
2,"Amusing, but I've seen better.","Jedi Junkies explores the obsession with the Star Wars franchise. I'm not a Star Wars fan, but I figured I would like this movie since I liked the Comic-Con documentary...and I'm not a fan of superheros or sci-fi. I was a little disappointed. I feel there was a lot of filler with ""fan film"" footage, but less substance. I would have liked to have seen more interviews with the ""junkies"" themselves."
4,Must for Star Wars fans.,"If you are a hard core Star Wars fan, you will love this. It is great to see the other fans show their appreciation for Star Wars. It is a little slow at times, but you will love it. I did't get the focus on the princess stuff... but the rest is amazing. Rent/buy this movie, and may the force be with you."
3,"Good reference, bad textbook","If all you need is a reference or a solution for a known problem related to contaminent hydrogelology, you can buy this book (although price seems a bit high for the value).If you are looking for a good textbook to help you learn and understand hydrogeology - look somewhere else."
5,This book was a lifeboat in a sea of despair!,"After discovering a marital infidelity at the beginning of a 4-day weekend, we had nowhere to turn but each other and the bookstore. We spent four days reading and talking, and found out that we were not alone. Reading this book quite literally saved our marriage.A *must read* for anyone touched by an infidelity."
4,Parrot Food,Very good food for my African Grey. Does not make a mess like seed style food and is good for him. Has the vitamins needed for his health and also keeps his feathers looking good.
4,Nice,"Not quite Mighty Joe, but certainly a strong album. The vocals, as always, are great and ""Sadness Soot"" and ""Spring Released"" get you up out of your chair. This is a great entree into the artist."
5,A Remarkable New Direction ! ! !,"Who would have thought that the man behind the classics ""Mighty Joe Moon,"" ""Fuzzy"" and ""Jubilee"" would pull the rug out from everything we've heard before and start fresh by choosing a new sonic path in 2001? Only a true artist evolves like this. Incredible. A must have!"
5,"""Sweetheart Of Song"" by Deanna Durbin","Am a Canadian. What more can I say? Being a self-styled ""musical-film historian"", this beautiful songbird from Winnipeg, Manitoba, was our contribution to saving Universal Studios, Hollywood, and, yes-the North American economy from financial ruin during the 1930s. She was a little girl with a big voice! Her videocassettes, CDs, and tapes will always be a part of my collection."
3,pretty good,"This book was pretty good. It was interesting to see how Jerry's career stared and what all he's done. In reading Jerry seems like a kind, good man. I do wish there had been more information of ""behind the scenes"" of the show though. If you are a Beaver fan it is worth reading"
1,"Not For Real ""Beaver"" Fans.","Jerry Mathers pretty much does nothing else in this book but print ""quotes"" from magazine articles about how great he was.Being a real fan of the show, I was disappointed in the lack of depth he felt for the show or it's characters. This book is a ""tribute"" to Jerry Mathers, written BY Jerry Mathers.A snoozefest for any real ""Leave It To Beaver"" fan.Don't even bother with it."
2,Ho hum,"The best, i.e., most bizarre, part of this book is the anecdote that recounts one of the last encounters between Mathers and his screen-dad.They saw each other in a grocery store and embraced. But then, Hugh Beaumont began to spew an uninterrupted stream of the most foul obscenities imaginable.Several customers who recognized Ward & the Beav' stood by, transfixed by the torrent of profanity.After a minute or so, the tirade ended and the elderly Beaumont apologized.Mathers said Tourette's Syndrome afflicted the kind & gentle minister-actor. Nevertheless, the younger Cleaver laments the bad impression that a few shoppers may have of this famed tv dad.That is the book's high point, so save your money."
2,Need Replacement Very Frequently,My humidifier needs 2 of these filters and they need to be replaced very frequently (pretty much weekly) and they are awkward to replace. With my model humidifier you have to remove the water base and you end up with water all over the floor. Not sure if it's the filters as much as the humidifer but I find the whole system more cumbersome than need be.
2,Just not very durable...,"First, you have to be very careful the humidifier is compeltely dry if you plan on not running it fora while, lest these filters are compeltely ruined by mold. Secondly, after washing them, they just get a little bit crumbly and fall apart. They aren't super expensive, but its still a nuisance for a filter that is supposed to be reasonably long lasting."
4,"Right fit for my humidifier, odd number to include in a set though.","These fit my Sunbeam SCM631 without issues and is working well.I question why they're sold as a pack of 3 rather than a pack of 2. AFAIK none of the Holmes or Sunbeam humidifiers use 3 of these filters at once. You're either left with an odd filter that is not used, or are forced to by two of these packs (which I did),"
2,Not nearly as effective as the originals,"For some reason, these just don't soak up water from the reservoir as much as the original filters that came with our Bionaire humidifier. At first, I would leave them in with the humidifier on all day and, upon checking the filters in the evening, there was plenty of water in the reservoir, but the tops of the filters were still dry! Our room remained quite dry and uncomfortable through this period. Our humidifier has a sensor that detects moisture at the tops of the filters (to indicate when to replace old filters), which has been pretty consistently giving a negative reading. However, after a couple weeks of frustrating use, they seem to be working just a little better these days.Also, wtf is up with the packs of three? Had to buy two packs to round it out, so I'll be stuck with these crumby filters for a while, but will surely be looking for a different product next time we need filters."
1,Not in good shape,"I suppose I should have realized that I was not getting 3 sets of filters. My Bionaire takes 2 filters at a time. Now I have one extra. Not at all happy with how I received these. They were shipped unpackaged in a plain paper manila envelope with no protection. Envelope was crushed and torn, and the black mesh backing was shredding little black bits. Also they seemed sprayed with dark purple ink (were they seconds??) Too late to have vendor replace them as I need them Now. Will take a drive up to WalMart to see if they have them."
2,One out of three worked!,I had trouble getting one of the batteries to be recognized by my JVC GZ-MG37U while the other one worked right out of the box. It could be because I don't have a separate charger and just tried doing it through the camcorder. TheMemStore people were very prompt in sending another replacement but it did not work either. Since it had the same symptom I just sent both the bad ones back and got a refund. When I get a charger I may try it again since you can't beat the price!
2,"Nice warranty, if you keep your laptop in perfect condition","This warranty has come in handy a couple of times. It has saved us from buying a new keyboard, and has fixed a faulty monitor. Where the trouble comes in is if you have any signs of accidental damage (related or unrelated to the component needing service), then warranty is void. In our case, our bird had taken a key off of the keyboard on our MBP and chewed a piece of the metal siding near a USB port. Well, when the laptop decided not to boot up several months later, Apple refused to work on the laptop due to the signs of damage. No amount of reasoning was going to sway them. The key and slight bend in the opening at the left USB port was enough for them to be able to throw my warranty in the trash. Wrap your laptop in bubble wrap if you buy Apple Care. No wonder Apple has so much cash in the bank!"
1,Consider a Third Party Provider,"This is a very expensive extended warranty and does not cover accidents. Although I don't believe my problem with my MacBook is an accident, that is what the Apple Store deemed the issue to be and of course this voids the warranty. Consider SquareTrade for a better priced extended warranty that includes accident insurance. Also, know your state law. You can usually cancel an extended warranty very close to the end of the term and receive a prorated refund. Not as enchanted with Apple as I once was!!!"
1,Did anyone proofread this?,"I agree with the reader(s) who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown-together, as if no one proofread it. In one chapter she'll recommend something; then later on she'll tell you it's ineffective and/or dangerous! She gives a long, long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss -- but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments, recommendations or opinions of her own. Personally I think most natural/ herbal supplements are a ripoff, but if she had given any testimonials by people who've found them to work, I might consider trying them. On the whole, this book is a waste of money."
4,Peering inside Steinbeck,"Fantastic ""Mind of the Writer"" memoir. Steinbeck gives us an unfiltered view of his writing process during one of his most challenging projects."
1,Where are the golden puppies in this movie????,"So disappointed! Thought this would be a cute follow-up to Santa Paws, which we watched last year with our golden. Instead this is a cheesy love story that barely has any doggie time at all...the puppies don't show up til the very end. Kids would probably be bored to tears."
4,Der Bingle as a cowboy,"Was driven to purchase this CD after watching ""Rhythm on the Range"" a very old movie which I was not that excited about renting, but the music raised memories of my childhood, as my parents had an album of some of these cowboy songs by Bing. We're talking 78's kiddies. There's a mix of good ones and not so good on here but if you like Bing it's well worth it. There appears to be a selection that ranges from the thirties into the forties, so you can hear the slight change in his style. And then there's the amazing Andrew Sisters to back him up on a few. Lots of fun."
3,Very Creative,"Very Different way of looking at life after death. I love ALL of Laura Esquivel's works of art, but this was simply entertaining."
3,Jain's Computer Performance Analysis Book Is OK,"I used Jain's performance book for my performance modeling course. It is very thorough in terms of the topics it covers, and I like that. Sometimes it is rather straight forward, and other times it is difficult to follow, and I think that could be improved upon. The book has content that is very practical as well as more academic content, which I liked.There are far too many errors in the book, and that is quite frustrating. There is plenty of errata, but a new edition of the book should be made with corrections. The book is rather dated, and I wish that in the new edition, it would be placed in the most modern context possible. I would like a companion site to go with the book where readers could discuss difficult material."
3,Buy Somewhere Else,I normally read reviews before i buy but i was in a hurry last minute shopping for vacation so i just purchased this. I didn't know the price is for one piece of plastic. They should have options so you can pick which piece you want. This is bs! I saw another review when i logged on to check to see when the rest of my stuff would be in and they had ordered 3 pieces and this seller gave them 2 of the same piece. I didn't give the fun rating option 5 stars because it's not much fun with one toy. Crazy people!
3,disappointing,"Napier seems to thrive between the worlds of fandom and academe, but to a reader who knows both areas, her work is sadly lacking. As in her last book, the Fantastic in Modern Japanese Literature, she hopes to pull the wool over the eyes of other academics by choosing a specialty that few of them know. But as other reviewers have pointed out, she doesn't know it all that well herself either, and her observations on the handful of anime she has seen are marred by a lack of *anime* context. Such holes in her ""fan"" knowledge don't do her any favors with the fan community either -- far more contextualisation and comprehension is offered in the more populist work of Patrick Drazen. Napier would do well to read it before teaching another course on anime."
3,Spoilers galore!,"This book feels like a term paper, very ""academic"". It goes into a deep analysis of each of the works (films and series analysed include Akira, Ranma 1/2, Pricess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, etc), linking it to the culture of the Japanese. It's a good read, if academic read doesn't bother you.What I find most irritating about the book is that it details the WHOLE plot of each of the films, with great detail in how they END. So, if you haven't seen the movie or series and don't want to find out how it turns out, don't read the section dedicated to it. The spoilers run through the complete section, not just one paragraph (e.g., the ending of Akira is discussed all the way).Another thing is that, in my opinion, it goes a little too deep, specially regarding sex and stereotypes. But at least it makes you think.It's not bad, but there must be better books on anime out there."
4,"May Lack, but Makes Up for it in the End","This book was written from an analysis perspective --- one in which reading it felt like taking your own personal Japanese anime course. There are, however, certain qualities that the book lacks. For example, Ms. Napier chose to focus more on the modern anime films/shows, and rarely mentioned much of the old classics that brought anime to existence in the first place. But aside from what's missing from this book, it does redeem itself later on. It gives any reader a sort of ""want"" to continue reading each and every single page. With interesting insight and tedious research put in, Susan J. Napier did do a very good job with this book. I believe some people expected too much out of it... Just how much can a writer cram into 256 pages?"
4,A very educational look at Anime,"Aside from a great cover, this book is an extremely interesting read, taking a whole new look at anime. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this isn't a guide to anime movies, or even anime in general. Rather, it takes fairly popular titles and explores the meaning behind the movies. A very interesting look at anime through the eyes of a professional. Enhances the experience."
3,It's o.k.,"but be warned that one of the so-called popular phrases it teaches is ""stupid idiot"". Sigh....."
5,Master Teacher of Teachers,"I've studied with Glenn many times at Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, NY and was thrilled to find out that he has a DVD available. Glenn has a profoundly deep understanding of yoga and anatomy and when you put that together with years of teaching experience you end up with a teacher who can help you learn to practice correctly, safely and deeply. His approach is very holistic creating a balance between strength and flexibility. This video was made earlier in Glenn's career but it's excellent and I highly recommend it. Glenn also has a DVD for ""Body Tuning"" that I highly recommend as well."
4,PetMate Pet Food Keeper,"I had ordered one of these from another vender and really liked the size. I wanted my daughter to have these since she is short on space, and I ordered two more keepers from this vendor. Though they arrived in a timely manner and were the same item I already owned, one did not have the cup attached to the inside of the lid, the top storage lid was not attached, and that lid pops off easily when the keeper is opened to the full extent. For the price and purpose of use, it wasn't worth sending the product back. I would order from the vendor if need arises."
4,victory,this is a great cd from the jacksons i already had this one on lp and just wanted it on a cd
2,Do not use if pregnant!,"This product contains dimethylbenzylammonium chloride, which is a known teratogen. It has been shown to cause birth defects.I recommend theProTec PC-1 Humidifier Tank Cleaning Cartridge (Pack of 2)instead. It contains silver and inert ingredients and is safe to use in pregnancy."
1,Be careful!!!,"I started using this product nights in my humidifier fall 2009. Came down with acute bronchitis Dec. 2009; had to go to emergency room in Jan. 2010 and subsequently was on oxygen for 10 days. Took 7 weeks to get rid of the bronchitis [and cost me a lot of money]. Guess how I contracted the bronchitis -- the bacteriostatic ingedient in this product: dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride. [Yes, we were able to isolate this variable in my environment.] Research this ingredient, and you will see that it can indeed induce bronchitis. So be very careful how you use products that contain it!!"
5,Excellent!,Keeps my humidifier smelling fresh and clean all the time. I highly recommend this product. (Be sure to add after filling the contained though or it will bubble up.)
1,horrible! can anyone say dubbed over?!,"bought this dvd and was excited. i had never seen rihanna live besides award show performances and some youtube clips. watched it and was shocked. the concert it's self was underwhelming. maybe i'm use to a higher quality when it comes to concerts but even comparing this to some early britney spears concerts, its just horrible.the dvd it's self was produced well. but the mere fact that they DUBBED OVER her actual voice was shocking. while view i thought it was me at first but then you start to notice mistakes like where the audio track is playing at a part where not only is the mic not up to her mouth but her mouth clearly isn't moving. rihanna doesn't have the strongest singing voice as far as live performances goes but seriously? did they think people wouldn't notice? save yourself the money. listen to rihanna the way she was suppose to be listened to- stuido recordings. watch her music videos. save yourself the time and effort."
2,Rihanna: Good Girl Gone Bad Live,"I'm a Rihanna fan but I don't get this Hairdo that she has here. Its 80's and so bad. Really not sexy like she was when she came out in 2005. Also, why is she going in a rock direction on this concert? She is an astounding RnB/Pop artist and does not need to add loud guitars in her mix. The guitars actually detract bigtime from this performance. However, Her voice is perfect and the sound and visual quality are top notch. The show is non-stop energy. I just hope she can bring back the original Rihanna that wasn't all leather and spikes. I KNOW the next tour will be better!"
4,Not Bad At All,"I was happy to see some of my past and current favorite bands listed in this book. There are no secrets in this book. If it's embarassing or stupid.. it's listed. We all have our musical heroes and heroines that we look up too, but sometimes the things they do are so awful you just have to cringe! With chapters on everyone from Motely Crue to Trent Reznor, it appears that the authors have spared no musician or band's pride. For example, did you know that Elton John had a pair of wooden pants made for him? If that doesn't seem funny enough, how about John Lennon sticking a Kotex on his head while arrogantly walking around the Troubador Club? In addition to stories like these, each chapter contains a ""Quickie Bio"" and a ""Dumbest Quotes"" section. Let's just say that it's nearly 300 pages of the most hilarious, yet well-researched brain candy I've seen in a long time. Read this book before your next party"
4,Concrete saw cart,"This cart worked very well. Easy to use. Cut well over 400 feet of detail lines 1/4"" deep for decorative concrete deck around a new swimming pool in less than 4 hours. Included layout and chalking lines. Would be nice if there was a guide to run along the chalk line. Recommend for inexpensive solution to cutting straight saw cuts."
3,It's cute,We haven't watched Dadnapped yet. We bought the video because our son is an extra in one of the scenes - so naturally we had to buy it. Hatching Pete is a cute movie and certainly acceptable and even entertaining for younger children.
4,Good tool for new user,"I bought this after buying a Canon a570is camera and I'm glad I did. Some cameras and owner's manuals are more intuitive than others. This is a great tool to teach you ""how to use the camera"" as well as some pointers on how to take good pictures. It goes step by step through each function and every button and combinations of buttons as well as creative alternatives. More importantly it tells how they work. Taking pictures with the camera set on ""auto"" is fine, but this DVD also tells you how to use the manual controls to your best advantage. I highly recommend this DVD to the casual user as well as those who want to expand there photographic horizons."
4,Not Hildegard Von Bingen !!!!!,"I purchased this title thinking--despite the unusual title--I was ordering a CD of Hildegard Von Bingen. The description states: Hildegarde of Bingen. Anyway, this is really music sung by a woman from Wisconsin, educated in Milwaukee. She went on to sing in European clubs and was quite popular It's campy WWII/30's & 40's club music. Fun, if you're in the right mood and almost worth the price of the mistake.This is not what you want if you're looking for Hildegard Von Bingen."
2,Author needs to hit spellcheck before publishing book!!,"This book is okay, very much like a classroom read, but he really needs to use his spellcheck. Lots and lots of errors. I am surprised at the publisher too."
5,Great Murder Mystery Collection,"30 short stories by various authors including: Agatha Christie, Ernest Hemingway, Dick Francis, Damon Runyon, Mary Ryan, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Wallace, Ed Gorman, Victor Bridges, Thomas Walsh, and more. The theme is murder surrounding horse races."
4,Lovely anime,"This is a beautifully done anime. The episodes don't have much in common save for the main character and his profession as a mushi master but it still keeps you watching. The art is such quality and it's just absolutely lovely. There is little to no action in the explosive sense, but it is engaging nonetheless."
5,Excellent,"This book is excellent. There are a few typos/errors but, nothing significant. It covers everything that is on the 640-505 test in great detail. There are practice tests at the end of every chapter. The ""Real World Projects"" at the end of each chapter did not always fit well but, if you called them example configurations, rather than projects, they are fine.I scored 920 on the test. If you thoroughly read and understand this book you cannot help but do well too. The book will also make for a good quick reference in the future.Also, see Richard Deal's Switching Exam Cram. It does an even better job for the 640-504 test. Truely outstanding work."
4,crafts,"This books has a unique idea: murder and mystery side-by-side with crafts. The mix of authors is fun to read, and a good way to see their different styles. And besides the stories there are craft how-tos."
1,NOT HAPPY!,I HAD THIS BAG SENT TO MY MOTHER FOR HER BIRTHDAY AND THE BAG I ORDERED AND THE BAG SHE RECEIVED WAS NOT THE SAME. BEACH CAMERA WANTED ME TO PAY FOR THE SHIPPING EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THEIR MISTAKE. FINALLY GOT THAT WORKED OUT AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD EXCHANGE IT. THAT'S FINE BUT SHE STILL DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER BAG (SINCE 6-17-09)WHO'S TO SAY THIS ONE WILL BE RIGHT! I'M GETTING READY TO CALL THEM NOW....GOOD LUCK PEOPLE
1,hated it,"this book had a cruddy storyline, dialouge, the works. It was not an indy book. I didn't even finish it. whatever you do, dont buy this book!"
5,Best Book I've Never Looked at Ever,"If this book is anything like it's African counterpart, then I approve! It doesn't take a genious to guess what's in this book. And I'm guessing it's good. So good, in fact, that I'm going to put it next to my African book on my coffee table, which is a huge deal. Nothing else has ever had the priveledge of parking itself next to that glorious, godly, tree-made piece of wonderful splendor. I'm licking my fingers just thinking about it. Those pages won't stick for me! I only hope that you have a credit card and can order things from Amazon. Because everything they sell is worth it. Thank you for reading this. But seriously, go to Asia. Eat Bamboo, no Pandas!"
3,Majikoi,"While there is a measure of nudity and a couple of yuri scenes, this isn't an endless sexual romp as might have been implied. The scene depicted on the cover nor the large rendering on the back of two girls boob-to-boob do not exist in this series anywhere. As for the story,it isn't anything worth mentioning in your next letter to your mother.The main one-on-one girl fight scene goes on to near the point of boredom as,quite frankly,does most of the series.Considering the faults cover art,the over-the-top price,(for what you get) and the looming recession,save your money or watch your friend's copy."
3,nice mb,"the best one for dual pci-x video... but this amazon/egghead sucks... you click on motherboard and you get so many unrelated products on the list. bring back the old egghead! I think the prices had gone up and most arent good deals anymore, I doubt I'd be shopping for computer components at egghead anymore... good thing there's still a local fry's store near me :P"
4,"This is an overall pretty good book, but there are problems.","This a very good book, but I believe a great deal of the reactions are unrealistic. Yes, there were many reactions displayed that were realistic but they just happen to be from the wrong people. I wouldn't expect a lot of the reactions from the type of people, like Morgan's father. I would expect more of a dumbfounded feel from him. I mean the man is running for governor, this could cost him the entire race. Otherwise this is a great book and recommend it to any of those up to a little ""harmless"" mischeif. It does definitely give you a little something to think about."
3,A different side of Cooney,"This was a really great book. i enjoyed it but the thing was that the title sounded scary and I was really ready for scary. i even had popcorn and a really soft huggy bear to squeeze when it got good. But the bear was useless. It was about two high school students who steal a stop sign and as a result a lady has a wreck. I mean, come on Cooney! You hanve done better!"
3,"Goodness, another one.","Hi there all, I read this book, and I do think that it is a great book, but, all in all, it could be better, It has the same plot esencialy as all of the other caroline B cooney books, There are two people who like eachother, they get together, and something breaks them up. Al in all, could have been a good romance/action thing if only she hadn't droped the romance part."
3,From Information Literacy & Technology Class,"Driver's Ed is fast paced at the beginning, when a couple teenagers steal a stop sign for fun from a busy intersection. A young woman gets in a car crash at that intersection later that night, and dies because there was no stop sign. Overwhelmed with guilt, they don't know if they should tell the authorities or keep it a secret forever. After the accident, the book becomes slow, and boring. The author only talks about the teenagers' feelings and how they deal with making the choice of admitting to the vandalism. There are also many unneeded characters in the plot, making it complicated and confusing. As it draws closer to the end, the book becomes boring and predictable. The ending is abrupt, and doesn't solve the problems that have been building up throughout the plot. I would not recommend this book to advanced readers.- Annesha"
4,driver's ed,"DRIVER'S EDThe reason why I think everyone will like this book called driver's ed driver's ed is because it is a lot about driving and it is about these people who steal signs and get in trouble for stealing and near the end of the book their parents find out about them stealing the signs and they do pickup at the freeways and everywhere. The main problem was they stole a sign but it never said that Morgan (one of the characters in the story) stole a sign so I don't know why it said he stole a sign.BY GARRETT, FAMULINER"
4,Fiction that became a realality,"All in all I thought the book was good. It was a little slow at first and took a while to get going. Ounce it got going though it was good. I think it's kinda ironic how Morgans dad fells about the person who did it, and then it turns out how she had a very realy part in this. It also hits kinda close to home because I have talked to kids at school that brag about steeling sighs, and then after this book was writen it realy happing in Texas is sorta wierd."
2,It was at a lower reading level then I am at.,"This book was average. If it is meant for people who are in Driver's Ed now then it should be more approiate for our reading level. When I read this book in sixth grade it was good, now it is boring. If Ms. Cooney is going to quote the Bible then she should do it in context. I thought this book was average and would not suggest it to my friends."
2,This Book=ZZZzzz,"This book is so boring! It started off very good, but then it went some 150 pages with out a single interesting thing happening! The entire book focuses on whether the characters should tell about a prank that ended up killing someone. In the last 25 pages, i could not put it down, but other than that, it was a snore!"
5,Excellent children's book,"""The Tomten"" by Astrid Lindgren is one of the most comforting books for children. The story remains with them through a lifetime. My 32 year old son and 35 year old nephew still would like to have ""Tomten"" books to read to the young ones in their families."
4,Punchy,Metal/Technology diverges from Winterlong's back catalogue significantly and now incorporates a more modern approach with keyboard samples and an occasional industrial vibe. The vocals are also alot more varied than the standard heavy metal vocals of their last few albums. M/T features a good array of tracks and variation for those looking for something a little different.
4,Robb and Eve Dallas rock again,"I find this book to be interesting, and captivating. All of the characters are evolving and maturing. I love this series and l;ook forward to reading the next."
2,Not that thrilling,"I don't know why this book keeps getting positive review, maybe they're all loyal fans of J.D Robb. I'm not going to wrtite any negatives about the author because I haven't read her other books, but so far this one is not so special. Not very orginal and clever."
5,holiday in death,I love this series by jd robb i own the book and i have it on my kindle as well I read the books over and over again in the future.
1,Another junky book with bad paper,I purchased this book with Judgement in Death. This is another book with horrid paper and way overpriced. If you want a quality hard bound book this isn't it. Don't waste your time or money.
2,black bubble gum for baby goths,"To be fair, I have not heard this entire album. However, this appears to be a vanity project. The songs are not bad. I've heard more silly goth romantic material out of bands that chart. ""Along The Edge Of Time"" has a catchy melody. However, you really need a full orchestra and a voice with enough gravitas to pull it off. What you have here is what sounds like a 15 year old singing music scored for drum machine and cell phone - who apparently think's he's Lestat.No doubt this impresses the baby goth set, but it has a different effect on an older crowd. It's just a little too precious.Listen before you buy."
4,Satisfactory purchase,"I do not have much experience in purchasing jewelry. However, I found it to be smaller than I thought for the price you buy it for and the picture is a tad misleading. The gift wrapping was a joke as I put forth eight bucks and only received a decorated box. It is very pretty and I am sure my recipient will like it, regardless. Those are the only two problems I have with it. Shipping was very fast."
5,2000 cadillac seville sls,bought this item sat around for over 2 years just found it in a box had it put on the 2000 seville sls northstar i love wix products
1,"Horrible quality, wish I didn't buy","I had much higher hopes for this Classic Television collection. I didn't expect the old shows to have perfect quality, but was surprised at how bad the quality really was. And the 'modern day' onscreen host was awful. The quality of video and audio when he was speaking was deplorable and that's new! If there isn't decent quality in that, how can anyone hope that the old shows would be decent quality? I would strongly advise against buying this and I've learned my lesson when buying classic television: make sure to check if things have been remastered because it really does matter."
3,New Mix???,"I've listened to the first track on this CD which is supposed to be a new mix of Can't Stop, but it sounds exactly the same as the LP version to me. If You Have to Ask is good live track. Christ Church Fireworks is a little different. It's the music John makes when he plays with his guitar knobs. It's a good jam, but Nothing To Lose on the second release of this single is better."
5,DON'T MISS THIS ONE!,"With so many of the great singer/songwriters no longer recording on the larger labels that get good promotion and advertising, it is a constant seek and find labor or love to find the many treasures that are out here. I just got this new recording by Mary Chapin Carpenter, and I am grateful for the privilege of listening to her great art, insight and entertaining music once again. If you loved ""Stones In The Road"" like I did, I hope you DON'T MISS THIS ONE!"""
2,Goin' back to the old days,"At least one can still listen to ""Down at the Twist and Shout"" and ""I Feel Lucky"" without hearing her hate America themed new ""folk"" songs."
5,A Fast-Paced Read,"Even if the only golf you play is of the miniature variety, you'll enjoy Six Strokes Under, a fast-paced amatuer slueth mystery. Robert Isleib has created an immensely likable protagonist in Cassie Burdette, as aspiring LPGA golfer with a cart-load of insecurities hobbling her game. Isleib's professional background as a psychologist pays off in the well-developed, complex characters she has created. No cardboard cliches here--even the minor characters are richly drawn. Cassie's efforts to overcome her demons and play well enough to earn a spot on the LPGA tour add drama to this well-plotted tale of sexual abuse, repressed memories, ruthless ambition and murder. Read it!"
2,"it ok, but nothing better","It seems Vanessa, no offence, but she whines through out the entire cd. And i'm not one to complain, but it's true. I mean it seems like she trying so hard to get her voice where it needs to be, and her voice isn't supposed to go as high or low, and she trys anyway. ""A thousand miles"" is a great song, but I think that will be her biggest hit."
1,kodak/sears commercial?!,"I could have sWORN i heard the single before in some kodak commercial. I love piano (having played myself for years), but just not this type. I'm actually surprised to read she's classically trained since the piano melodies and chords are not that complicated, just repetitive; i could play back any of these songs almost immediately, whereas other piano songs, take me a bit longer. She sounds talented enough, but every1 has different tastes. By the way, people who protest the comparisons between her and other female pianists are correct. I might even be so bold to say she is the complete opposite of amos, same instruments do not mean anything. The melodies, chord progressions, lyrics, are very different, and inferior."
3,Yet Another CD With 1 Good Song,"Perhaps being a male in my late 30's has something to do with it but I wish I'd simply bought the single ""A Thousand Miles"" which was the main reason I bought Be Not Nobody hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately aside from ""A Thousand Miles"" the only other songs worth mentioning are ""Ordinary Day"" and ""Twilight"" but even those don't match the appeal and beauty of ""Thousand Miles"". Yet another CD with only a few (1) truly good song, the rest may appeal to a younger angst ridden crowd, older listeners will probably just yawn and tell Ms. Carlton to ""get over it."" Hopefully this talented young woman will find better material next time out."
2,Letdown,"Wow, this let me down. I thought she would be a breath of fresh air to music. It is original, but her voice is SO bad that I can't enjoy it. Songs like ""Sway"" and ""Rinse"" are so akward that you don't know whats going on. Then songs like ""Unsung"" and Twillight"" are really cool but her voice! Someone else would make them great! ""A Thousand Miles"" is very misleading because her voice is so much better in it.By the way how dare she do ""paint it black""."
2,mediocre,"I was swayed by the pop freshness and arrangement of ""A Thousand Miles"" and decided to purchase the cd. Unfortunately, the rest of the cd is mediocre at best. Everything else pales by comparison. I would look elsewhere for new music."
4,spunky,"As my mom says, Vanessa Carlton is a poet. Her lyrics are wonderful and you can get absolutly caught up every song on the album. Everything's been put together beautifully- although I admit that her voice could be better. After a while, though, it doesn't matter, because her sincerity shows through so well."
2,"Put 4 female artists in a blender, puree and pour","Vanessa Cartlon's debut was widely hyped after the saturation of her first single ""A Thousand Miles"" on the radio. At that time, I thought she had potential, but bascially considered her to be Michelle Branch with a piano. Having listened to the whole CD, it's more like she's trying to be Michelle Branch, Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, and Alanis Morisette all at the same time... and not doing a very good job of it. The CD starts light then gets progressively darker - while it's a nice transition in a way, Ms. Carlton should stick with one style and develop it, rather than be all over the place."
4,its really good!,"all the songs are really good, except she repeats the same lyrics over and over and sometimes she sounds like a cat but otherwise, it's really good. the best songs are ordinary day, unsung, a thousand miles, rinse, prince and paint it black. if you're reading these, and trying to decide to buy it, i tell you DEFINITELY GET IT!!!"
3,slightly better than Average!,"i was very curious about Vanessa Carlton so I had to hear Her material.for me personally She&Alicia Keys are kinda along the same lines overall to me.maybe it's the Classical Piano Vibe they both come from.they both have alright Voices but not quite fully developed yet.as for the Material here: certain things work some don't.A thousand Miles reminds me of Mid 80's Bruce Hornsby&the Range. but Her Cover of the Stones ""Paint it Black"" is neck in neck with Brittney's Weak take on ""Satisfaction"" not a Smart Move.with Carlton's background in Classical I think doing what the Verve did with ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" would have worked better to me.needless to say this set is better than Average&there is Hope.She has a nice Pop Sound."
2,Tradgic Sellout,"I bought this CD for one song, and other than that one song and two others, everything else was really bad. Most of the songs in this CD were so wierd that I thought ""what the hell is she siging about."" Also there were the lyrics. The lyrics in some of these songs made the lyrics from ""The Transplants"" sound good, and these weren't even about dead people and drugs. The only songs that I found good were ""Unsung,"" ""Paint it Black,"" and the chart topping hit ""A Thousand Miles."" Other songs like ""Pretty Baby"" and ""Ordinary Day"" were just plain stupid. Really consider buying this CD before you buy it."
3,Good piano skills- bad voice,"I don't own this CD, but I have heard it a couple of times. I agree with other reviewers that Vanessa sounds like a whiney little girl at a piano recital (except for the fact that she's REALLY GOOD at piano). It's really nice to know that something with piano has finally become popular. I really like the song A Thousand Miles, but her whiney and breathy voice gets really annoying after a while. I, personally, wouldn't buy the CD, but I've downloaded A Thousand Miles. I guess it's just a matter of opinion."
3,Highly Overrated,"Though anticipation for Vanessa Carlton's debut had been mounting up until the time of its' release(largely thanks to the first-rate single 'A Thousand Miles'), one spin of BE NOT NOBODY leaves the impression that the hype was a little unjustified. Granted, 'A Thousand Miles' is superb, and a few of the other cuts aren't bad('Ordinary Day','Pretty Baby'), but listening makes one wonder where all those Tori/Fiona comparisons are coming from, other than from people who don't listen to either of those artists. Carlton lacks not only the emotional starkness and vocal ability of Apple, but also the lyrical directness that marks Amos' best work. Seriously,it seems as though it is now prerequisite to compare any woman sitting behind a piano to either Amos or Apple, or both. BE NOT NOBODY is a pleasant enough debut, but I'm afraid she's going to have to go much more than a 'thousand miles' to come close to the Tori/Fiona axis that everyone is so eager to lump her in."
2,Not a Great Voice,"Her piano hooks are catchy and good. She is a talented pianist, but I just don't get the big deal everyone makes out of her voice. It really grated on my nerves except for the song ""Ordinary Day."" I didn't really like any other songs on the whole album. Her later 2 albums are so much better than her first atemtp."
1,Lacking emotion...,"Lately, I've been giving this new wave of instrument playing singers/songwriters a chance. I've downloaded this and listened to each and every track, but it still falls flat on its face!! Playing an instrument doesn't always equal a good album! The only tracks worth listening to are ""Unsung"" (one of two upbeat numbers), ""Ordinary Day"", and the Rolling Stones cover ""Paint It Black"" (the second of the two upbeat numbers). The rest of the songs seem to sound similar in their slow and depressing sound. Why do they sound almost alike, you ask? Well, that's because the remainder of the album lacks any vocal variety. Vanessa sings the majority of the songs in the same limited range. It's like listening to a mediocre singer on American Idol!! You wait for the exciting part, and when that doesn't come, you then pray that it's over soon. Hope this helps you out!!"
3,GOOD (I GUESS),Wen her debut single (A Thousand Miles) came out I thought she would b like da next Alicia Keys. Wen I listend 2 her new single 'Ordinary Day' I still kinda thought dat. But wen I listened 2 her album I was shocked! It was not as good as I thought. I didn't even wanted 2 listen 2 da whole cd. I give her 3 stars bcoz of her 2 singles. I'll give credit 2 them coz I thought they were good songs.
4,"I could walk 1,000 miles listening to it!","I think this is a great album, considering this is her first album, she is absolutely talented no doubt. Her voice range is amazing & even though I'm not quite sure of where I stand on her cover of ""Paint It Black"" I think she's doing a great job considering her competition. I would suggest to anyone that doesn't have the 1,000 miles single to get it simply for the live version of ""Twilight"" this girl is amazing & watch as she will without a doubt rise to the top! If she comes to concert, she won't be one to miss!"
4,Great Album!!!,"I bought the cd for ""A Thousand Miles"", and I wasn't disappointed with the rest of the cd. I ended up totally falling in love with the first song ""Oridinary Day"", what a great song! The album is full of different kinds of songs. Some of the songs are pretty deep and intense, and then there's more upbeat songs also. She is a talented young lady and I definitely think she's got a future. She plays the piano like you wouldn't believe. It's great to hear actual talent on the radio these days."
3,"Good, but they have better b-sides","I like to buy Peppers singles because they always put interesting b-sides out with them. This one features 2 live tracks. ""Right on Time"" is more exciting live than the original album version complete with ""London Calling"" by the Clash as an intro. The other track ""Nothing to Lose"" is a cool jam very similar in places to the end of ""Seach and Destroy"" from their ""Off the Map"" DVD. I prefer the one on the DVD but this one is still solid and has more of Anthony improvising than the DVD version."
4,Different,Apart from the synthesiser drums (no mention of a drummer on the sleeve)and the high pitched vocals this is a pretty good album. The tracks are catchy and the musicianship is good.
5,The Ultimate Gladys Knight & The Pips,"The excellent Universal Music Group GOLD series continues with this great collection of classic cuts by Gladys Knight & The Pips. What makes this compilation so special is that it contains all but three of the group's top-20 r&b hits (the three not on this collection are 1968's ""Didn't You Know You Have To Cry Sometime"" and ""I Wish It Would Rain"", and 1978's ""It's A Better Than Good Time""). With improved sound and always great liner notes, GOLD is definitely the perfect introduction to this legendary group."
5,They're both right,"The reviewers who have come before me have variously praised this fine book, and called Elizabeth Bowen a sadist. Quite so. This book has the suicidal weariness of Brideshead Revisited, and a protagonist that you'd like to shake some sense into, a la Of Human Bondage. That said, both the prose and the dialogue are pure pleasure to read. If you find this book a downer, cleanse your palate with I Capture The Castle, the flip side of this story."
3,Quite the Soap Opera!,"I found this book very difficult to read in that I felt horrible for the character Portia. How foolish can a sensible person be? Having said that, it means that the book was written in a way to hold my interest."
2,"Poor acting, Poor Dialogue. Not a good start","My wife and I were pretty disappointed with the pilot episode of Bionic Woman. As Battlestar Galactica fans we were excited to see Starbuck and Chief in this episode but unfortunately neither one shined. The story was not good, the acting even worse. I had high hopes for this show and from the previews I thought the new show Chuck was going to be lame and this show would be the one to watch ... turned out it was the other way around. The characters in this show were not interesting or likable. The characters in Chuck were both.I'm guessing once the novelty of this show wears off people will see it for what it is ... unless the writing changes drastically."
1,WHO PICKS THESE RELEASES???,"I can't believe this updated TV show of The Bionic Woman is already on DVD. Although the original show was not up to today's stanards, it was a stepping stone to the level of what some good science fiction is today. It also had a great deal of charm and a pulse.This new version of The Bionic Woman is a vapid and sterile framework that seem to exist to just to propel from accelarated fight scene to fight scene. The cast was good, but that's about it.The original series of The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman are still not available in the US but are in other countries. The same people who pick what is going to released on DVD must be of the same mentality that give the green light for production of very poor remake."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in the Bionic woman. The story on the first episode was disjointed and I never really bonded with the main characters. It never captured my attention. Hopefully, it will improve, but I don't have much hope for it. It wasn't even bad enough to be good."
1,Another disappointed Mac User,"All my friends who have seen the Bionic Woman on Broadcast have said it is worth the time. Unfortunately Amazon and NBC have missed the boat and only provide for PC viewing. Amazon/NBC, wake up the new personal digital revolution is happening on Apple products. It is a BIG mistake to dump iTunes.....""It just works!"""
4,Cannot Transfer Video to PVP,"The pilot is great. However, although it is free from amazon, you cannot transfer it to your PVP. I have a creative zen and it just won't let you. This should be noted someplace.But this is a great show. I don't have Tivo and wish that I could see it on my TV."
4,Excellent Remake,"This is great remake of an old classic. With upgraded SFX and good casting, you can only hope that the writing and direction can keep pace with the non-stop action. Keep it up NBC and I will stay tuned."
1,pfft,"I second the opinion of others, no Mac support, new format, ""buying"", where the product expires after 30 days. Thats just plain silly."
3,OK,MOVIE OK BUT NOT MY TYPE. WAS A BAD CHOICE FOR ME. NO TECHNICAL PROBLEM THOUGH. LOVE THE SERVICE. WOULD USE IT AGAIN.
3,"Very Mysterious, but not a Bionic Start","A new show with great potential, but I'll need to see more clarity in the future stories since this one gave bits & pieces of many things to come. As long as some of the mysteries and/or underlying stories start to come together in an overall idea, then I'll be watching. Otherwise, just another remake that didn't quite make it. We'll hope for the best."
2,Very disappointing,"If Katie Sackhoff had been hired to play Jamie Summers and if the writers had all been fired and replaced by people capable of actually writing good stories, intelligent characters and compelling stories this might have been a great show. But she wasn't, they weren't and it most certainly was not. I also sincerely wish Hollywood would stop casting pretty over talented or even suitable for the part. Very disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"This had so much potential, but the writing falls flat. Too many holes in the plot, cliches, etc. With shows such as Heroes and Lost, viewers have a higher standard, and Bionic Woman isn't living up to it."
5,Excellent Remake! Eick does it again!,"This remake of Bionic Woman is an excellent show which does away with the campiness of the original to make the story more true-to-life.If you like theBattlestar Galactica: The Mini-Seriesremake, you will love this show!"
2,Nice attempt.....,"I like the old days of Lee Majors.So far, after only having see the pilot I have to say, nothing new. Of course they made it more modern, got rid of those weird Electro-Sounds but overall it's still just a fast, strong gal with a good eye and ear.The pilot could have been much more with a little more of a plausible intro to how she becomes an agent. They violate her with those tool implanted, she mad for a bit but then ""all cool"" about it. It is just a little odd to me.I will possibly watch another episode or so but if it does not improve drastically, it won't be a show for me."
1,UNBOX SUX,"I would like to view my videos on my PC while at home and on my laptop while away. I downloaded several to my PC, but NOWHERE are there instructions on how to authenticate another computer. So I can't take my videos on the road. The help page is awful. When I try to log into my account from unbox on my laptop, it tells me it's not authenticated, but doesn't tell me how I can. This product really needs some help."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"It was an OK show, I was just expecting it to be a LOT better. I had assumed the ""bionics"" were going to be more... flashy I guess... but didn't even hold a candle to the 70's show."
2,Borring new TV series!,"The original series starring Lindsey Wagner that was shown in the 70s was much better than this remake. Started out okay; but by the time the third episode aired, I got bored. Was confused on which way the villain was going. Is she good or bad?? Got tired of being confused with this muddled written show and no longer watch it. Sorry"
1,Didn't cut the mustard,My Freshman son said that compared to the other reeds that he has used these are very difficult to control. He found it irrationally hard to produce stable low notes.
3,20 bit,"I love ""Sir"" Elton, ( if one must) I have all of Elton's greatest hit's and this is an awesome CD, But I just wish we could get to some REAL re-mastering! Anyone with good audio equipment can relate! Is there ever going to be a STANDARD to CD recording with a minimum ""BIT"" recording..."
1,Dissappointing,"I found this cd set to be somewhat lacking in quality. The recordings have obviously not been remastered since they were originally produced for LP's, and the resultant product on these cds is scratchy and limp at best - incomprehendable at worst. What makes it all the more glaring is that as the cd tracks are arranged in chronological order, the quality of the recordings gradually gets better. But, if you play track 20 followed by track 5, the gap in quality is reprehensible. Very poorly executed."
5,Fantastic Collection!,"This is one fantastic collection of Elton's greatest hits. It has two CDs, and they sound just great. If you're looking for a nice collection of Elton John's music, you certainly can't go wrong with this album."
4,"Nice Job Elton, We'll Miss You","Sad but true, this collection is supposed to be his last album until things start changing in the music industry. At least he'll be going out on a good note though. This Collection really is great. I think this is his best album yet. It's all of his Greatest Hits... What more could you ask for? I don't like all of the songs on it, so that is why I only gave it four stars instead of five. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a great collection and a great price. If you like Elton John at all, buy this set, it has everything an Elton John fan could want, and compared to his other greatest hits collections this one is a lot better."
5,Elton John - Greatest Hits 1970-2002,The service from Misshighquality was Excellent!!!!!!!!!!! She has been the best seller I have bought from. I was truly pleased with the service she provided. I would definitely buy from her again.
5,For the price and music it's good.,"Greatest Hits packages to me have never been a testament to the artists best work. If you're looking for a little slip away with Elton John, this collection provides everything you're looking for.As I said, for the price and quality of the music, it's good, although not meaty."
3,A little disappointed,So many great Elton John songs but this CD has lots that weren't so good. I should have checked it out more before purchasing.
4,Should Have Been A Three Disc Set,"For someone who just wants to have most of Elton's best known songs, this is a very good way to acquire them. But this selection is far from complete. I did a little homework and found out Elton had another 31 top forty hits during the years 1970-2002. That's a lot of material to leave out on a ""greatest hits"" release. I assume the reason for that was price, as a three CD collection would approach that of a box set. If you buy, or have bought this collection, you can expand it by downloading all those extra tracks from Amazon or various other websites. Then your ""greatest hits"" collection from EJ will be complete!"
4,miss his jazzy piano playing,"I recently purchased ""Elton 60"", his Madison Square Garden concert DVDs, and I haven't tired of listening yet, mostly because of his extended, almost jazzy piano riffs that are arguably better than the basic songs themselves. This CD, in contrast, is his basic greatest hits collection as originally recorded, with not a lot of ivory tickling, which I miss. But still, Elton is Elton, and he's rarely bad, although some of his more recent hits that are included don't do much for me. I prefer his earlier songs, and fortunately there's plenty of those on these two CDs. It's a great collection to listen to while you're driving."
5,Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002,"This takes me back to my teen years. It has all of my favorite Elton John songs, mainly on Disc 1. Disc 2 is the later years when I didn't keep up with music as closely as in those teen years. It is great to get all of my favorites on one CD and at such a low cost. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Elton John, especially in the 70s."
3,all over again and again!!,"the best thing abvout this greatest hits is that now you know the exactly amount of crap tunnies this fella have sell us!he cant fill a complete doble cd with really hits.hes best moments are his anecdotes with john lennon. dont foul with me!. the famous ""los year""of john in the clubs, in the bathrooms with Elton...but that is not record music. is words and laughs.plase...elton..have a baby...and, of couse, if it possible ..a vietnamise child...for ..well, you know...E entertaiment mag!"
1,Where the H@#$ are the rest of the tunes?,"Some of my favorite Elton tunes are not even in this set...Where's the soulful ""Momma Can't Buy You Love""???? Also, I firmly believe the ORIGINAL ""Don't Let the Sun..."" was much better than the subpar duet with George Michael. NEVER EVER FADE OUT A TUNE THAT ORIGINALLY HAD A COMPLETE ENDING!!!! What a disappointment. I've already gotten rid of my copy."
1,Missing One of his Best Songs,Elton John comes out with a new greatest hits CD every other year it seems but the song Funeral for a Friend never makes it on the CD. Until it does the greatest hits CD's from Elton John will always be considered partial greatest hits to me.Sorry you old Queen but that's the way it is.
3,No get up and go...,"I'm an avid collector of ""Star Cars"" movies, so naturally I was interested in this book. It came up short. First it concentrates on British film, which is fine if that's what interests you. Some of the truly great American car movies- ""The Great Race"", ""Christine"", ""The Car"", etc get maybe a small paragraph and a photo. Nothing really new or in depth here. As a completist, I'm glad I got it. But if you're really looking for a good book on Cars in the Movies, pass on this one. I'm hoping the other car book I ordered is better."
4,Use it with other books on blackwork,"To be fair, in contention with what the first reviewer said, there are a few patterns given in the book. See one page I have included in the Images above. That said, there are really few given...but that's no the purpose of this book. It's only 48 pages long and it's all about designing your own picture or sampler and incorporating your own diaper patterns. ""Diaper"" means repeated patterns such as the various blocks of designs in the cover's sampler on the left. (What's funny in the book is that either the chart is upside down or the picture on the cover is!)If you enjoy blackwork, there are many other designing books, books with charts, diaper patterns or pictures and histories that you can find. Here are some of my favorites:BlackworkBlackwork (Essential Stitch Guide)Blackwork Embroidery (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)New Anchor Book of Blackwork Embroidery StitchesTraditional Blackwork Samplers (Needlecrafts Series)The Art of Blackwork Embroidery"
1,Yuck I hate Celine's Version,"I was watching tv when the Chrysler commercial came and I saw Celine's big nose and i said to myself OH NO she didn'tI have listened to all the versions of this song by Roy Orbison,Cindy Lauper and what's her face and I honestly like Cindy's version better, her voice are more powerful, soulful(if there is such a word)....Thats what I think."
1,piece of crap,"Skip this ox and move on. Sounds horrible. You can tune it, watch videos on tuning it and it sounds like crap. Don't waste your money."
4,Every family has a rose and the rose's petals touch all.,"This is a touching story about a seemingly ordinary family. The strength, determination, pride and faith of the Pagna's Rose reaches all members of the family and guides them through their lives. For a career football coach who has primarily dealt with ""X's and O's"", Tom Pagna displays a great command of the written word in describing this remarkable woman, his mother. I suspect that this book will remind all of its readers of the Rose in their family and the extraordinary things mothers do to nurture, goad, challange, encourage and love their children."
2,MusicMatch Jukebox 6.10,"I purchased the Music Match Jukebox 6.1. I wanted to burn a CD but the software would only let me burn a CD at 2x300 KB/s.........if I wanted to use CD speeds of 4x600 KB/s, 8X1200 KB/s, and 12 x 1800 KB/s I had to download and pay $19.99 for the Music Match Jukebox PLUS........I did not think that was fair.I do like the music library and the ease of listening to and burning CD's but I do not like having all the KB/s listed but not available to use them unless I paid more money for the software. Just is not fair."
2,Average Features,"I purchased it to record the old cassettes to CDs, but it did not work. And technical support was not very helpful. Ultimately I had to fall back on Windows Sound recorder, making me wonder why I purchased it.For ripping music from CDs to MP3s, it works just fine, though user interface is complicated unlike other software where you can just copy and paste the files.The retail version is costlier than the one available on MusicMatch site. I paid more for version 6, while version 7 was being sold on the site for less. Also there is no Software Update option available from the menu, though you can go to the site and down load and install new version.My suggestion is - try the free-download version and compare with trial version of other products, before purchasing it. Overall, I will rate it as average performing product with average price. Nothing to rave about!"
3,Works pretty well,The stain eraser is a bit awkward to use. My lower teeth are crowded so does not get in the tight spaces on the back of my teeth as much as I would prefer. Works okay on the front of my teeth where I have more control over the eraser.
1,like sandpaper on your teeth,"this was a waste of a couple of $'s. This is literally a Q-tip, with sandpaper on the end...it's gritty, and not necessary to use...teeth are bones, by using sandpaper on them, it will only wear away the teeth. Some peoples teeth are never going to get white, no matter what they try- like me! it sucks, but after trying about 50 products, I have come to that conclusion. and I DO NOT smoke, or drink coffee/wine. If you go tanning, it will make your teeth look whiter.This product can damage the condition of your teeth. I would advise not to use."
1,Kind of disappointed,"The dark gray eraser/tip of the tool comes off on your teeth. The tip is much harder than what I thought it would be. It might help a little bit but, I think my family will stick w/ the old fashioned whitening w/ mixture of baking soda and peroxide. Probably wouldn't buy these again, so I can't recommend them to anyone else."
5,Grace-filled help for speech!,This book has been a most convicting and yet hopeful book for my Bible study group... one of the most practical and fundamental ways to really put into practice what I say I believe as a Christian!
2,i left feeling disappointed,"at first i was excited to read this book, it's been my mother's favorite for years. i laughed outloud at the main character, who seems to have every bit of misfortune going his way. just when it seems like things cant get any worse, he finds out he's being robbed over and over by the same man. he snaps. he decides he's going to catch this thief all by himself.after a crazy and comical ordeal the robber is tied up in his kitchen. it was kind of odd when the two characters started a friendly relationship. by the end of the book i had two pages to go and JUST DID NOT WANT TO READ ANYMORE. i finished it - finally - but it felt like slow torture.my advice: read the first half and then make up the rest of the story using your imagination. i promise it will be better that way."
1,Irwin is JUNK,"First off, I'm an elecrician who had to run to the store in a hurry for drill bits. If it would've been at my leisure I would've NOT bought these. The case. I take care of ALL my tools. I'm a bit anal when it comes to that. They all go in their proper cases and bags. Cords nicely wrapped. The third time I opened this case the hinges fell apart. JUNK! The second time I used the 1 1/4"" bit with a DeWalt 18V cordless on a double pine ceiling joist the 1/4"" shank bent under stress. I make sure to look for nails in the wood before drilling and that was definetly not the case. Like I said, I take care of my tools. That would just ruin a NON-nail eater. Now if I HAVE to use the bit, the drill wobbles around while using it. The 1"" happened just as the 1 1/4"" did. The smaller bits might be fine as they're not taking on a lot of stress. I plan to work those too when it comes time to low volt a house."
3,Changed formula?,"I've been using this facial moisturizer for over 4 years and have loved it. It didn't make my face feel dirty or greasy, but really moisturized my skin. I recently had a child and was even using it on her skin since she seemed to be reacting badly to ""baby lotions"" that had a lot more strange ingredients. We got a new container of it and they added an ingredient that makes it smell REALLY WEIRD! I don't like putting it on my face because of the smell, but otherwise it still works the same. The smell doesn't seem to last a long time, it's just that initial 10-20 minutes... Someone else might like the smell, but one reason I used this lotion was that it didn't have any sort of smell. We'll be using up this container and I'll be on the search for a new moisturizer."
2,Eh.,"This stuff perplexes me. The tub of it is very very light, I actually thought it might be empty when I first picked it up. But when I put it on it was very greasy and thick, which I don't like. I ended up having a horrible allergic reaction after using it for a few days. I've never reacted to any chemicals before, so it was really really weird for me."
4,A whole lot of puzzle!,"Great set of puzzles. Right now our 2.5 year old matches on the picture not on the word letters, but he still enjoys it. It is also good because it uses lower case letters instead of upper case so he is getting more practice with the less familiar letters. The product contains a number of pictures and words on both the front and back of the pieces so the number of puzzles can be quite overwhelming. We just take a few out at a time for play. And a slight drawback is that if the whole puzzle is dumped out, it can only be stored by putting them all back together, which can take awhile. Otherwise, it is a great toy and he will love to start putting the words together when he gets a little older."
1,A cheap ruffle!,"I,too, almost purchased a white Koala Baby dust ruffle to go with a Classic Pooh & His Honey Pots comforter. I saw it at Babies 'R' Us and couldn't believe how poorly made it was. The fabric was flimsy and the length of the drop was shorter than any dust ruffle I have ever seen. Also, there was no hem on it; it was just sewn over! Probably the cheapest quality baby item I've ever seen!"
4,good real good not bad good,Ian Royak #19i got this game thought it was sweet totally tricked out man but the levels after you beat it the first time it gets to easy i beat the 2nd time in 1 hour and thrty minutes unlike enter the matrix it is really long and some missions are really hard and you have to think of what needs to be done. not this it didn't feel as challenging the second time than the first time.
5,the greatest psychedelic BAND EVER,I have collected music for yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeears and with in the last 5 alllllllllllllllllllllllllot of psychedelic music more then any of you kids out there in almost tv land can't even imagine and this this my baby I love this record and wished i had it autographed or better yet to get the band back together.atlas steele
4,A Western way to learn the essentials,"The importance of this book and the DVD I purchased on Taiji Ball Qigong is the practicle way it teaches the essentials. I've seen a lot of people try Tai Chi and Qigong, but don't return because it is alien to western minds. It seems that the western mind has to have something substantial to keep it occupied. The ball is the perfect tool to open up the western mind. At first it is exercise (which we understand), but hidden underneath the movement is Eastern wisdom. The essentials, strength and flexibility come through. Before you know it, you're ready for Tai Chi and Qigong."
2,Take it with a grain of salt,"Bought this book like many others to prepare for the Sun Cert Exams. Looked impressive, sample test CD, big book; must be good. Words of warning: if you do not know Solaris previously, you are in trouble! There are several items that are flat out wrong! To add insult to injury, when you take the trial test, those answers contradict what is in the book and they are wrong too! Go figure! Based on what I have encountered here, I would look elsewhere for material to prepare for the Sun Cert. exams."
1,not what I wanted,I was looking for something with more pictures and a ID key. This book is a little heady.
4,Good Concise Coverage of Synthetic Projective Geometry,"Coxeter provides good coverage of the fundamental concepts of synthetic projective geometry. This is a good introductory book. The examples provided are clear. Coxeter's style is concise. Topics such as Desargues theorem , Pappus's theorem and conics are covered. The solutions to some exercises can be found in the back of the book. The book addresses finite geometries and analytic projective with a chapter on each."
1,Terrible Novel by a Great Writer,I have read every David Lindsey novel and enjoyed each and every one of them. I couldn't wait to get my hands on Animosity. Was I evey disappointed. This is a terribly written book. It took 100 pages before any suspense took place. The book was so predictable that I knew the villian immediately. The book is simply preposterous and unbelieveable. Don't waste your time on this one.
2,Animosity = What the reader feels,"Having read and thorougly enjoyed Lindsay's Absence of Light, I eagerly bought everything else of his that I could find. My second voyage into his writing was this book. IF ONLY I had read the assessment of the first review!! This book is nothing like what Lindsay is capable of. It is boring, predictable and its characters are somewhere in between overdrawn and ridiculous. In an attempt to have a series of twists and turns, the author has the reader spinning - leaving one with a sense of nausea at times. I shall not give up on Lindsay, however. Absense of Light was so brilliant that I'm sure this was just a fluke."
3,Mercy,"Though not one of Lindsey's best novels, this one does have suspense and it builds to an interesting climax. Lindsey seems to be trying something new with this novel. It has less of a deliberate pace than his other works. Ross Marteau is more naive and corrupted than the usual Lindsey protagonist, which makes the ending all the more interesting. Lindsey is known for his articulate prose and peculiar characters, and with the latter he out does himself in this novel. Mr. Lindsey has set a very high bar for himself so when he writes a solid novel, but not a great novel one cannot help but be a little disappointed. I do recommend you not make this your first Lindsey book. Try Mercy or In the Lake of the Moon."
