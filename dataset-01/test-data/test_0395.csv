3,All fits together very clearly,I was hoping to learn about postmodernism. Instead I felt as I read I was given a very coherent picture of socialism and its failingsUnfortunately this is one of those taste books; When you finish reading it you get a bad taste developI feel now that I need to read books by authors who try to give a more neutral account. This is a book that takes two hundred pages to say postmodernism comes from socialism and is discredited and failed.... and we beat those damn commiesI have given it 3 stars as i think it has created sufficient emotion in me that I will further my studies in this areaIf I were to risk irony (which I am told is postmodern) I would say that it will sell more books and the self styled capitalist author will be delighted
2,Not All That!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Save your money. Book could be written much better by a preschooler.
1,Did not work for me,"I want to return this, but not sure how to go about doing so.......It did not help my food problem, I think I need surgery................."
4,Bunion Brace,"Developed a bunion on my right foot and found the pain increasing. Surgery is not an option in my case. Started wearing the brace while at home, then under my footwear during the day. I found that the condition improved greatly in about a week. After about ten days or so of continuous use, I found that I can now go for several days without pain without the brace in place. One problem I did find using the brace during the day under my socks is that it tends bunch up and to shift around and can get very uncomfortable between the large toe and one next to it. I fixed this by making the opening of the brace smaller by sewing the ends in slightly. Also, I used a gel-spacer between the large and second toe that also kept this bunching up from occurring. I found the product very, very useful in alleviating the pain from the bunion."
1,Don't waste your money,"These do not fit properly, and not enough tension is put on the big toe to align it properly. May fit better on large foot. I wear a woman's 8.5 medium, and this product was much too large to do any good for me."
1,Ouch...Bunion Toe Straightener too restraining,"The bunionion toe straightener was too tight on my toe which was already hurting me. The toe cover is tight, and if your toe is already hurting or you may have swelling in that area, I would not recommend this product."
2,BUNION TOE STRAIGHTENER,"After surgery on my BIG TOE and informed by my Dr. that I needed a ""bunion splint"" to keep toe straight. I immediately researched varies ""Bunion Splints/Toe Straighteners."" The review for this one was ""Positive."" I've never had a circulation problem nor diabetic. Their was NO circulation within my foot area, TIGHT! TIGHT! TIGHT! NUMB! NUMB! NUMB! My leg was even affected, so ""OFF"" it went. It's HARD GETTING ON, but it was EASIER GETTING OFF. The positive, NOT BULKY can wear with shoe, washable and latex FREE, but NOT FOR ME!!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I have a small foot (ladies size 6), and this product does not seem to fit tightly enough to properly align my big toe."
3,lack of exercises (2&half stars),"I needed to provide my two sons, 4th & 5th grade, challenging math because the school is not able to facilitate any to them. This book is quite self-explanatory and my two boys could follow it fine. (Note: I am NOT trying to recommend this book for 4th & 5th graders. My sons are at least 2 years ahead of average math skills. I am trying to emphasize that the problems are so well explained that my lower school sons can follow) However, this book lacks the following: Not enough exercises; no indepth exercise or problems; lack of word problems and applicaton. It serves well in the surface level of most pre-algebra topics, but not in-depth. I would recommend another one : Prealgebra by K. Elayn Martin-Gay, which is packed with exercises, and the lessons are very self-explanatory as well; and there are answers keys to the odd questions only."
2,Clueless in the Midwest,"There seems to be a little bit of everything here for everyone into or curious about BDSM. But forget about the sexually graphic content; you like it or you don't. What of this work as literature or cultural commentary? If you knew the liberating non-fiction works of Ms Brame previously, you like I might have expected some sort of literary manifesto from this author. Instead it was just a long, sometimes tediously titillating narrative of what goes on in such places, albeit an ideal one, with unrelenting rudeness towards the pathetic anti-hero as the central focus. The ending was surprising, or more properly, unexpected, because it didn't really arise organically out of the groundwork laid out by the novel. I was troubled by the lack of ethics implied by the final resolution. [...] I must be listed among the clueless as well, because I found nothing liberating about this novel."
3,Not that great.,"Though this book did not have that much info that I didnt already know, it was a little insintive to get excersizing. As a person who wants to be a marine it helped a little, but there are better books out there."
4,The Next President,"I really enjoyed the book, but did not rate it a 5 only because of the following:1. To many names2. Jumped around to much from one place to another (if you had the time to sit down and read it all at once, I probably would have rated it a 5, but kept having to stop and remember who the person was he was talking about.3. I would recommend it.4. Great descriptions of the people and places, one felt like you knew them."
3,Read Something Else,Preposterously unrealistic. The scenes change so rapidly that continuity suffers. The Evan Cade subplot is lame.
5,Scrumptious collection of recipes using your processor!,This is one of those wonderful cookbooks put out by HP Books. Full of beautiful pictures and great recipes this book is a treasure. Containing recipes from Holiday Roast Turkey to Saucy Shrimp Squares this book has it all.

5,Great Monitor,"Love this monitor. Have Used it for years without any issues. Power supply is rock steady. Color looks good too. Easy to adjust screen display with the buttons provided on the lower right of the monitor. It has inputs for either DVI or VGA. Bought it for my dad because he needed a larger screen for easier viewing, and the combination of resolution and screen size was perfect for him."
5,From the Publisher,"""The paintings of Jonathan Green (American, b. 1955) masterfully convey the abiding rural Southern themes of work, love, belonging, and spirituality. Transcending cultural and ethnic boundaries, Green's paintings reflect a deep respect for human dignity and worth and a sense of joy and hope for the future. A graduate of the Art Institute of Chicago, Green has exhibited his works in group and solo exhibitions throughout the United States. The thirty colorful, sensitive paintings in this book of postcards capture the artist's memories of life on the inland marshlands of South Carolina.""Pomegranate's books of postcards contain thirty top-quality reproductions bound together in a handy collection. Easy to remove and produced on heavy card stock, these stunning postcards are a delight to the sender and receiver; they also make great little books. ISBN: 0-7649-0025-0; size: 4 3/4 x 6 7/8"".""-- Pomegranate"
5,Modern versus Contemporary critical reflections/debates on the Arts,"This book was a historical landmark in the beginnings of modern criticism, and is seen as a pioneering benchmark for artistic reference. Its relevance today is that its poetic language or vernacular manages to engage the reader in a strange relationship with contemporary art criticism, opening up all kinds of possiblities for the artist(s)/curator who wishes to broaden their historical frames of reference. It is then a specialists book that equally throws light onto our times, it is up to the reader of course on how far their imagination can accomodate this. I recommend this book to anyone with an open mind who is curious about how past and present times are constructed, viewed and discussed."
1,Terrible quality,"I bought this card as an upgrade for my Dell Optiplex to drive two monitors. It failed after two weeks. I sent it back to the factory. They repaired it, and after three weeks it failed again. I'm looking for another card now."
2,Save Your Money,"I purchased three paintball markers made by ViewLoader, one for myself, and two for my nephews so we could play together. The guns functioned just fine out of the box, but the plastic handle grips never fit right (a common complaint that I've read on here). Accuracy and velocity were very poor. Even with top quality paintballs they would curve every which way when exiting the barrel. The gun would also dry fire a lot due to poor loading. Despite this we enjoyed playing using them. But then it happened... after only 3 months the motherboard on my gun died. Customer Service at ViewLoader (owned by BrassEagle, owned by JT Sports, as you'll come to find out when you TRY and contact Customer Service for the first time) was extremely poor, after 3 months I couldn't get them to send me a replacement board. Save your money. Spend a bit more and get something better!"
1,terrible customer service,"I returned a pair of pillows two weeks ago and have placed over 7 calls to customer service, only to be told to leave a call back number and we'll call back....no calls...so I pretended I was placing an order to get a live person...she said they were still on duty for one more hour on Thanksgiving eve...switched me over and the recording said, sorry, we are on our vacation break....The worst....."
2,Feather Pillows,I tried to sleep om them but they would not hold any shape. My head would sink in the middle and all the pillow would be on both my sides. Caused me to have neck problems. They were nice pillows but I guess I need more support.
4,Birds of Fire,I got this album because it's Billy Cobham on the set and he's one of the original creators of jazz fusion. I highly recommend this album; how they made this music so amazing in the 70's when we didn't know as much about music is amazing to me.
5,BIRDS OF FIRE:THE BEST JAZZ-ROCK-FUNK-ALBUM EVER,"This an awesome album. The guitar and violin are awesome, if you like jazz BUY IT!if you like rock and roll, BUY IT1 if you like funk or rap(no lyrics) BUY IT! BUY THIS NOW!!!!"
5,A Classic...,A superb fusion album that stands the test of time.I enjoy listening to it as much now as I did when I first heard it in 1970's.
4,Great Pillow if priced a bit high,"The pillow is very comfortable and gives you support for the neck and upper back. It is soft, yet not squissy. The feel of it makes one want to fall asleep almost instantly. I love down, and if you do, then this could be a pillow for you. The price is kind of high, but since I have had it, I haven't woken up with a stiff neck, so it is worth it to me."
2,Incomplete Item Information--How Much Down Is In The Pillow?,"I have not purchased this pillow. I purchased two down pillows on sale at a local Target for a small fraction of this price. The item information is incomplete. This pillow has a fill power of 550. The fill power rating is a measure of the loft or how much volume a unit weight of down occupies. Larger fill power numbers are better. The item description does not provide any information on the fill weight in ounces. At the price of this pillow, you should be getting a well-stuffed pillow."
3,Towel Warmer - No --- Towel Drying Rack - Yes,"We purchased this for our son's apartment. It does a great job of drying towels and I would recommend it on that alone, but as a towel heater, don't spend your money. The heat isn't well distributed in the towel, spotty at best. If you want to reuse towels and want them dry, this is the ticket. Saves on laundry and works better than a regular towel rod for that."
5,warm towels,I had one of these for 10 years and it finally stopped working. This was my replacement. I hope this one lasts as long as the last one. It looks identical. So far it has worked great. I wouldn't be without one. I mounted mine on the wall out of the way. The last one was on the floor and got in the way a little.
1,Warm?,Nice looking - does not work... you'd be better served to place your towels over the HVAC register. Just does not make for warm towels. Amazon has graciously replced mine but the new one is no different.
3,Nice in the winter months,"San Diego doesn't get that cold, but I've found that my towels always seem damp in the morning. I got this and found that although it doesn't make the towel ""out of the dryer"" hot, it keeps it dry and warm.Like other posters, I've noticed that it does work best with two towels on top of each other (seems strange, I know).It comes with either a stand alone stand or attachments to hook up to your wall. I, personally, chose the stand alone legs.Overall, it's not super sturdy like the on the wall towel racks you'll find at hotels, but certainly does the job for me."
2,towel dryer - not towel warmer,"This barely warms towels but works well for drying them and avoiding a mildewy smell in our cold bathroom. Being able to count on a dry fresh smelling towel, along with a decent price, makes buying it worthwhile to me."
1,Not all songs listed are on the CD,"The listing of songs lists more than the actual songs on the cd. Very disappointing. There are actually only the first 5 songs on the CD. I would have ordered the other Karaoke Cd. I think anyone interested in this Karaoke Cd should not get this one, but order the other one."
2,Doesn't Work Properly,"I ordered this product because I have already owned one just like it. But, the problem I have with my old one continues on this new one. When I put a cd in, it says NO DISC and I cannot play many cd on this item. What is wrong with it? Since buying it I have a very sick husband and have not taken the time to do anything about it. Thanks"
3,Good for What It Is,"This product will not work for iPod Nano. Since that's the iPod version the majority of the population owns right now, this car mount is probably not for you. However, if you own an old-school iPod, it's a great thing to have to keep the iPod from flying around in the floor of your car."
3,If you need a purple shirt,If you need a purple shirt this is a good one. The cotton is of good quality and the fit is as should be expected. The printing is not cheap and will not flake off easily.
1,Does not warm or dry towels,"This product is a disappointment. I assume it is not broken because it is very hot to the touch, but it does not in any way warm the towels. There is an occasional warm spot, but that's about it. I arrange my towels exactly as shown on the picture, because apparently that's important."
4,Warmrails Towel Shelf,"When we received the shelf it was broken and we contacted Amazon and got it replaced right away without difficulty. The second one arrived in good shape and has been installed. It does what it says it will do. The towels are warm and the unit seems to keep the bathroom warmer than it has been in the past. This room is small and does not have a built in heater. While the shelf is a bit larger than we anticipated, it is a good size for the towels and keeps them warm and ready for use. It is a welcome addition to our house."
4,CSI NY Season 5,If you love CSI NY you will not be disapointed. I really loved and almost watched it all in one sitting. I look forward to season 6.
5,CSI: NY - The Fifth Season,"TRUE TO THE SYSTEM. IT KEEPS WITH THE OVERALL THEME VERY WELL. THE ACTION IS REAL, THE SCIENCE IS BELIEVABLE., AND THE ACTORS MAKE YOU BELIEVE THEY ARE REAL PEOPLE. GREAT SHOW."
4,Helen's Piano Sings,"Only the second (of three) CDs so far from Helen Sung as leader of her own group, ""HELENISTIQUE"" gives us a varied sampling of this unusually gifted young pianist's approach to standards and originals. She has technique to burn but isn't ostentatious about it, plays some familiar compositions but makes them her own, is very strong rhythmically but can play with amazing delicacy as well. A tradition made up of Monk, Powell, Evans, Hancock and Jarrett has a very comfortable spot in it for Helen Sung."
4,the brusiers were still standin up at the time but the music stands the test of time!!,"this is a live testament to boston""s brusiers american IO classics the sound is lacking but the music stands tall and proud.not many band in Io can deliver like the brusiers,angry and solid musicianship rise above the sound faults(it sounds very old proably not ever meant to be releaseed)but i'm glad it was great cd."
5,Newsies,"I just saw this movie a couple of weeks ago. After seeing it, I knew I had to be a proud owner of the movie and the sountrack. This movie desplays the right to free speech, got to love that!"
1,such a good movie and common the doogie howser kid,the movie was so good when i was a kid going to see it and now i am 16 and i know my music i am the virgin megastore icon. But this was so much fun as a child and now it is even better
4,Great Item,"This item is adorable. They are a little expensive, but look great with the Gossamer Wings Nursery set. I expected them to be a shiny material, but they are a very thin cotton (a little hard to iron)."
1,Some Nations Would Love For Us To Turn On The USA Gov.,"Perfect examlpe of how easily facts can be manipulated, to appear as the truth. How truths can be altered, yet appear as if they have not. And finally, how hard many will work, how far they will go, in attempts to turn the American People against our Government. I think the author should take up residence in Afganistan, I understand land there, is very cheap; especially now."
2,Fair Reception poor dialing,"I like the feel and size of the phone. Battery life has not been fantastic but acceptable. I often seem to get echo in my connections. Most troubling thing though is that when dialing a number I never am able to actually dial without having to correct it several times. For example I hit a 2 and I get 12 or 21 instead. The keypad is just plain awful. Very frustrating when so much effort is needed just to dial a simple number. Never experienced anything like this before, this is my 7th phone give or take and by far most disappointing. My previous Samsung was very good. I do like the speaker phone and camera works alright."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"HAVING JUST READ 2 WONDERFUL DEELIN BOOKS, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ONE. IT STARTED OUT WELL BUT WENT NOWHERE."
3,Very Disappointed.,I love this show. I watch it every time it comes on but I did not like Jim getting killed. I think he is part of what makes the show so good. He and Melanie have something special and I think that Sam cannot take the place of Jim even if he does become like Jim.
4,A Few Twists and Turns and Back to Start,"I found the fourth season a return to the formulae that made the first two seasons intriguing. There is less of thequest for finding the real ""Jim ""and more of the general exploration of the supernatural.There are additional characters brought in that add to the drama, suspense and melodrama.The son is a cute and well needed addition to the cast and puts a different spin on things, especiallylooking at the paranormal from the perspective of a child. I would recommend this season to all fellow Ghost Whisperer fans"
2,Read Arbatova's plays instead,"This ""almost a novel"" is Arbatova's weakest book so far. I would recommend her autobiographical prose and plays instead. Especially after having read the rest of her work, the characters are too recognizable, the opinions exchanged strike as having been aired before, and the plot is a bit too (melo)dramatic. All this said, it is beautifully written in places."
3,"Too Much Hammond, Not Enough Magic","This is the blues equivalent of Blind Faith, a supergroup that never took off. The reason is on the record, a lackluster, tepid effort from three guys who each waited for the other to take the reins and run. No one did. While it's not awful, and some tracks are quite enjoyable (""Cha-Dooky-Doo,"" ""I Yi-Yi""), the overall experience leaves you a bit wanting. Personally, I would have liked a lot more Dr. John and Bloomfield, and a lot less Hammond. At least on this recording, he strikes me as out of his depth and simply not in the same league as his band mates.I did notice the inestimable Thomas Jefferson Kaye sat in on these recordings, no doubt supplying the chemical support needed to keep these guys happy and in the studio. Apparently, according to the liner notes, that was not an easy job. This is a curio, for hard-core fans of these musicians only."
5,kids really enjoyed it,kids really enjoyed it. plus was a wonderful opportunity to teach about the current election using this book to make the kids aware of the election.
5,Simply the Best,"""Simply the BEST CANNED CLAMS I know, and I tried quite a few. The taste and the texture are great. Also the color es pinkishlike the real thing. This is my second order of 12 cans and I'm really satisfied. Finally they are not chewey like others are. ""Date: June 11, 2010 Rated by Buyer: pepeton1"
3,interesting story,"I disagree with the person that did the review. I thought the story was interesting considering the person took his story from life's experiences and true to life according to him. Now, he isn't a Denzel or a George Lucas therefore I thought the story wasn't bad. Very entertaining, but sad. I am tired of Black Men wanting to be pimps, players, and just plain ole bull shitters but I think this man is trying to change his life and let you see what this lifestyle can lead too. You will never be respected by the masses and only the people at this level will look up to you. But over all the story did keep my attention in the sense that I can't believe women acutally bought into this crap. Where are they now? For the most part, I think he is a good writer may not wanna hear this stuff but he is giving it to you raw and uncut. He is from the hood so consider the source."
4,Adorable and loved!,"I bought this for my niece for Christmas, and she LOVED it! I paired it with a true-life book about a rescued snow leopard cub. She read the book and wouldn't let go of the leopard the whole weekend she was here. Very soft and lovable, and looks realistic. Time will tell on the durability."
2,State of the Union,i generally like Brad Thor. But this book was not well thought through. Often cliche ridden. I lost interest from time to time.
3,Good But Too Drawn Out,Good story but too drawn out. Also blow by blow description of torture techniques was uncomfortable and unnecessary. Unlikely to buy another book by this author.
1,Publisher must have been desperate,"Take a catalog of tactical gear and weaponry (complete with gushing descriptions of brand names and specs). Wind around it the outline of a half-thought-out plot, people it with cardboard characters, toss in one or two short-lived but totally predictable plot twists, and you've got a Brad Thor novel. Complete and utter drek.The biggest mystery in this book is how a writer of so little talent manages to get published anywhere outside ""Soldier of Fortune."""
1,Really bad,"The creators of Scooby Doo have taken to writing action thrillers. One-dimensional, heavily stereotyped characters make their way through the world while just happening to always be in the right place at the right time with all the right equipment. If there was any more Deus ex machina in these novels, Thor would have to write himself in as a character. I am not a generally a critical reader, but I just had to put this one down."
4,From Russia with Love,"Not only a real page turner but a thinking mans thinker. Suitcase Nucs placed throughout America. And based on fact. That will make you think if nothing else will. A Seal turned Secret Service agent is enough but the perilous situations that Scott gets himself into to save us and our way of life never seems to end and as the novel closes he is off to Paris to face another villain. All in all a great story, my kind of action and a lot of fun to read."
2,weaker by the chapter,"Thor's third thriller starts out with a bang and slowly loses much of its pazzazz as it goes along. By the ending chapters I thought this one was far too predictable. I'm still a fan and look forward to future works, but whereas I was breathless in the beginning of this one, I found myself yawning by the end and checking out the next release by other favorite authors. Sorry Brad!!"
3,Review of State of the Union,It was good but not great. It follows his other books and i was hoping this would venture a little outside of that. Still a good fast read.
4,Good Thriller,"Brad Thor gave me exactly what I expected- a fast moving military and political thriller which was well written, mostly believable, and full of twists and turns. I read the entire story in one day (I was on vacation). I enjoyed every minute. The main character is unstoppable, hobnobs with the president, and has many miraculous escapes, but I am willing to tolerate that in a good thriller.Dan Brown wrote a positive review on the cover of my edition, as well he might. Thor is a better writer in many ways. His characters are more believable, the action is more exciting, and the outcome was not easily predictable until near the end. There were no lengthy expositions of falsified history either.Thor doesn't take pains to be politically correct, and I like that. This is a straightforward novel where the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there is no ambiguity. It isn't deep or difficult, just plain entertaining."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See book description above.Brad Thor is becoming one of my favorite international thriller writers. The weaponry is researched, the action is good, and you know his protagonist is invulnerable. The invulnerability of Scot Harvath (like Cusslers' Pitt) will make you suspend belief in the story but it sure makes for great escapist reading. Keep it up Brad Thor, your books keep getting better.Highly recommended."
1,Troblesome...,These games are very hard to play and figure out. Most of them you almost have to cheat to finish them. Just like on one of them you have to set you alarm clock to a specific time to catch a late night clue.
2,Not my favorite Nancy Drew,"I've played a few of the other ND mysteries and enjoyed them. The graphics for White Wolf are nice, and the story is pretty good. Most of the puzzles for this one are just okay, but the cooking 'drill' and housekeeping got repetitive and tedious. It kind of ruined the game for me."
1,"nancy drew ""the white wolf of icicle creek",The game does not save. And I can only get so far in the game and it does not explain what to do next. Very disappointed.
4,CSI MIAMI,Bought it as a Christmas gift for my grandaughter. She is a big Horatio fan - so I guess she loves it!
2,not 100%,There was supposed to be a 100% guarantee the used product would worWork and it didn't. The one whole disks wouldn't play without skips The return was fast but that's the only good part. Don't guarentee something that isn't true.
2,Pretty bad,"I was extremely disappointed after reading this book. At least I didn't buy it, though. I seriously think that the author/s know very little about dogs. There were numerous spelling errors, which don't bother many people, but it does bother me. For instance, 'Bergamasco' was spelled 'Bergamsco' which is a bit unprofessional if you ask me. Another thing that I was *shocked* to see was that they made the mistake of calling a rough collie a 'Long-haired border collie', which is a pretty hard mistake to make if you know anything about dogs. After seeing that, I shut the book immediately and just assumed that the author had no idea what she was doing when she wrote a book about dogs. To sum it all up, I was disgusted with this book."
5,the dog encyclopedia,great book fast shipping and great packaging. book like new. would recommnd it for anyone learning about different dog breeds color pictures & lots of information.
1,Christian-slanted propaganda and foolish drivel,The only good thing about the book is that it made a good stabilizer (the perfect width to keep my table sturdy.) The book is obviously written for those self-righteous beings who have decided to have a 'one-week-long-wild-side'. Masello is obviously a rookie to the scene and is looking to score a quick buck on the new 'occult is cool' market. Poor work on such a fascinating and powerful subject.
5,keeping the details to a bare minimum,"Raising Hell: A Concise History of the Black Arts and Those Who Dared Practice Them by Robert Masello is an concise but comprehensive overview of the history of occult arts throughout the centuries, filled with interesting stories and creative characters in search of power beyond their control. The book is divided into several distinct sections, each dealing with a specific aspect of the occult arts, giving the reader a wonderful glimpse into the powers which lie in the great beyond. Although it makes mention of numerous sources and reference material, by keeping the details to a bare minimum he only serves to wet one's whistle on the nature of his survey, making readers want to delve deeper into regions unknown. A great start for people interested in the occult but don't know where to start."
3,"Beautiful & really ""out there""","I feel EWF's 4th album HEAD TO THE SKY was a major step up from the 2 previous albums! ""Evil"" has a rhythm that grabs you and won't let go (and dig that Kalimba!). ""Keep Your Head To The Sky"" then sets your soul souring with positive waves (and I just think it's so ""cute"" when they hit those really HIGH notes at the end!). While the jam session ""Zanzibar"" MAY go on too long (and just WHAT was that on the intro??) the remainder of the album is solid and reinforces what EWF does best-- make you feel better about being ALIVE!"
2,Expensive protectors,"They were right when they said multipack. There's more thanone in there: there's TWO! For the totally outrageous shipping costs,I think the price sucks.I've had them for a month or so now. The first one is still on the screen,so it's not a total loss."
5,Very beautiful book!,"This book was recommended to me by a religious sister who said it changed her life and her way of thinking about what happens to us - the good and the bad.This book explains very well how good things and bad things are given to us all within the divine will and will always lead to a greater good. It's a quick read, and I frequently reread parts of it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially those who are struggling with trust in God and faith in the Divine will."
1,piece of junk,"I received this saw for Christmas. It is junk. I can't cut anything thicker than a piece of paper without the blade falling out. And yes, I have read the instructions and am inserting it correctly. Maybe I got a lemon because others don't seem to have this problem. But if mine is any indication, save your money. In general B&D makes garbage anymore."
3,"Handy, but....","Don't expect this to be a heavy duty saw...but it is handy for the small stuff. If you have an AC powered jig saw...hang on to it because this is not substitute. Battery stays charged a long, long time which is an advantage."
4,it meets my need,"I have never used a powered saw. So, this is perfect and I feel safe using it. I am able to cut what I needed to cut-- 1/2 and 1 inch plywood. It is not fast but it did the job. I gave only 4 stars because the first one i got had to be returned-- the clamp did not hold the blade. Amazon sent me a new one immediately. I have no problem with the second one."
5,Excellent saw for small jobs.,"This handsaw is great for small jobs and crafts. It's easy to use, and portable. Not made for big jobs, like cutting big pieces of wood, etc. If you're a crafty person and do a lot of cutting, this Black & Decker Hand Saw can speed things up, thus getting your project done quicker and easier. It's a nice little addition to your work tools.If you're looking for a small piece of equipment to help you get your cutting jobs done, the Black & Decker Hand Saw is the way to go."
4,small saw for small things,This product arrived promptly and was in perfect condition. The small battery operated saw is good for really small branches and such. I only ordered it because I already had the saw but had lost the charger. Now I have 2 saws with one charger. Works for me!!!
2,disapointed,I had high hopes for this tool b&d; has been good for methis is a toy not a toolit is useless for any real workit may have some use but I donot see it
5,Handy and easy to use,"Limited use at this point, but the two tasks I've done were easy with this saw."
3,Wonderful Family Movie,"Christmas Mountain is a wonderful family movie...a movie for all ages. It has a wonderful message of love and caring, a little action and the acting is well done. Slim Pickens is fun to watch as a Christmas angel. This is not an academy award winning film by any means but it is enjoyable for holidays."
5,Outstanding!!!,Creative combinations. A seriously gourmet approach to vegetarian eating. Lots of helpful ideas and new ways to prepare vegetables and get off meat.
5,sixlets,my favorite candy- sixlets- try it - I use to buy them when I was a child- and glad to be able to purchase a perfect candy
3,A LOT of practice,"I read a lot of reviews about these bottles, not only here, but at Babies R Us. I was so excited to try them for the first time when my baby was 4 weeks old. I gave them three stars because he didn't take them very well at first and it took A LOT of practice. My husband always fed him but every time we gave him to someone else to feed him, it always took a little bit for the baby and also whoever was feeding him to get the suction going. I really like them but at the same time, they make feeding a little more frustrating and he sucks a lot of air unless you shove the bottle in his mouth. I hope others have better luck with them. I continue to use them when I'm not breastfeeding and it's definitely gotten better but it took awhile for me and baby to get used to them."
4,Awesome!,"No leaks at all, maybe others' bottles were defective or they didn't put on or align the nipple correctly. Works just like the breast...no nipple confusion when I had to use these for a GI formula trial with my infant daughter. We switched right on to these from the breast, and right back onto the breast when the formula trial was finished with no fuss!BPA free would be preferred, of course..."
2,not worth the money,I have had these bottles for 5 weeks for my nursing baby. The latch is no different then an Avent bottle which is cheaper. The bottles leak and they are a pain to wash with the extra insert part. I have switched to Tomee Tippee bottles which are more like BF'n. The Breastflow bottles have a lot of air in them as well.
2,"Story decent, kindle lousy","I love the tribble episodes, TOS and DS9, no question. I enjoy most of Carey's stories, too, no question about that either. And this is a decent novelization, though I expected more fleshing out.But the Kindle edition is almost impossible to read. There are no breaks between scenes -- every scene just runs into the next one. And there are neither breaks between paragraphs nor indenting of paragraphs. There were numerous times I had to go back and reread, and recall the episode, to realize, ""ah, yes, we're in a new scene,"" or ""okay, this is where somebody else started acting or talking.""If a person hadn't seen the episode, I suspect they would be completely lost, trying to read this on Kindle."
4,Don't buy the timer recommended with this,The towel warmer is very nice for the price. It dries things well and keeps the towels warm and ready for use. Don't buy the timer that's recommended on-line. The warmer has a three prong electrical connection and the timer only provides for a two-prong.
4,A problem solver!,"My old house is without the benefit of central heat/air. As a result, parts of the downstairs are perpetually dank. Towels would stay damp from one bath to the next, unless I ran them through the clothes dryer. Time and trouble. Having guests meant constantly monitoring the bathroom.I was rather desperate for comfort when I ordered this, and I wasn't expecting much. What a pleasant surprise! My towels now dry completely and quickly. If I want a warm towel after my bath, I flick the switch while I run the water. Usually, though, it's only used for drying towels and hand washables. (Wet bedroom slippers dry promptly when hooked over the poles.)The only reason this treasure is not awarded five stars is that I've not yet gotten a utility bill for the time period after its arrival. Info when I get it."
1,Cheap and Nasty,"The product was very poorly made, looked cheap and the brushed nickel had a sickly green hew to it.Would not recommend this item to anyone"
1,DO NOT BUY THE PIECE OF JUNK (AND I AM BEING POLITE!),this was one of the most disappointing gifts i have given or received in my life (all 58 years of it!). you want dry warm towels? throw them in the dryer for 5 minutes. place them in the sunny window for 10 minutes. this piece of junk does not work. i gave it to my best friend and his wife (an outlay of 119 bucks!) and it now sits in the junk heap only weeks after christmas. it was meant as a christmas gift. don't buy anyting from this manufacturer! its a rip off. it doesn't work taking upwards to an hour and a half to half warm towels.
1,Does not warm the entire towel,"Got this for my wife for Christmas. She is not real happy with it and quit using it. It doesn't heat the entire towel, only warms where the bars touch the towel and the outside of the towel stays cold. Our bathroom is in the back of the house and not that warm, that's why I got it for her. I guess it needs a warm bathroom. Wish I could send it back."
4,A solid 4 star,"If you are looking for a European style hot water powered towel warmer, you are going to be dissapointed. If you are looking for a good warmer that does the job, can and should be on a put on a timer for everyday use, this will work. Compared the $1000 or so you would pay for a to get a ""real"" towel warmer this one does a solid job. Wrap the towels into the coils for greater heat and be VERY careful measuring to make sure you actually have the space, this thing is BIG!"
2,Insulation Too Light,"The jacket is suppose to handle extreme cold. The jacket I received had medium/light insulation. I wore it in 50F and was comfortable. I don't know if it could handle 30F much less extreme cold. I have a Rothco N3B parka and the insulation is heavier. I have taken the N3B Parka into snow and it could handle the cold. I call Rothco about the N2B jacket and they did not seem interested in my opinion. They just said return it. I provided my opinion on the Rothco website, but my review is now gone. The jacket runs big but the finish is good. I am a M and ordered a S."
4,Jordan's Truth,"Most of the reporters and authors talk about the luxuries, health, and most importanly the scandals of an athlete. No one goes further than that, but in this book you will find out things you never even imagined about Jordan. You will see how his daily life in the locker room was. Everything said in this book was mostly quoted by him."
4,why is the kindle edition lacking?,"i bought the kindle edition of this book Golden Dawn. However, the format of the table of contents compared to the paperback edition is different. Sad to say, even the knowledge lectures are not the same; it's lacking in the kindle edition!please help me with this!"
1,Cracked by a simple pressure!,I didn't aware of such damage will gonna be happened to a product that was made by the best PDA case maker. What a shame!Now I have a case without multidapt and I have to buy one to replace!
1,Complete disapointment,"I have a few DMT products and they are all great, except for this one ! This thing does not work as advertised at all. Using a regular sharpener is much better. My chef's knife was much duller after I used it. I had to go back to regular DMT sharpeners to get it to cut well again."
3,This is not the place to go on a tirade,I don`t come here to read tirades such as Mr. Cornwhathisface`s. I come here hoping for honest reviews. Keep it up and I will be doing all of my book/cd shopping at Powell`s. Peace.
2,Poor service,"This business is NOT responsive to customer requests and does NOT correct their problems. My lighting unit was sent to the wrong address, but the representative could not tell me what they would do about that. When I received the product weeks after I needed it and submitted a request to return it, my request was completely ignored."
1,Not great customer service,"Kisses were good - same as you would buy in store. Order 5 lb bag. 3 lb bag arrived instead. Didn't ship remaining missing order as requested. Not great customer service, communication not great."
3,Loved the ones that did not leak?!,"I loved the soothie starter kit that I purchased at Walmart for a couple of reasons: It was cute, cheap, and looked very comfortable for my baby to hold... She loves them as well, when they are not drenching her! Out of the 3 sets that I had purchased at least 5 of the nipples leaked- very dissapointing:( I really wish they would adress the problem and fix it, because the ones that don't leak are my favorite bottles. I was using bottles that were 10 dollars a peice and I loved them, but who can afford that in abundance? I also found the starter kit quite convient, because you can attach the formula right to the bottle and throw it in the diaper bag! Such a shame...."
2,Disappointing yet memorable,"I'm a great fan of Michael Ondaatje's novels, and for some reason was hoping for the same wonderful sense of mystery and feeling of intellectual involvement I get from them. This was a mistake, as most of the time while reading Andorra I felt let down by simple dialogue and hollow characters. However, the author's descriptions of the make-believe country are compelling, and I still think about them, two years after reading the book. If you want to read the book, don't expect much and you might be rewarded by a trip to fantasy land!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book after reading all the great reviews of it in the papers. The first few chapters I found charming. The author's ability to capture details, to describe scenery is undoubtedly remarkable. However, the plot was ridiculous, or the way the story developed was a bit forced and the magic just disappeared."
3,Somewhat Disappointing Collection,"While this album has several duds; there are winners enough (Air That I Breathe, Carousel)to make it worth the price."
2,Be Warned!,"Despite the remastering, the first three songs on this CD are apparently still reproduced in mono. When heard through headphones, the vocal and some of the music comes out though the right speaker and the rest of the music comes out through the left speaker. No vocal is heard through the left speaker. I owned this collection before it was remastered and I don't recall this happening. I also own the two disc Hollies Greatest Hits collection and this does not occur on either of those discs. On the two disc set, the vocal comes out through both speakers. Somebody messed up!"
2,No Bonus Track,"The Amazon description shows track 13 (The Air That I Breathe) as part of this album, but the used version I bought does not have the bonus track. Make sure to confirm that the version you buy has track 13."
4,Has all the big hits,I like this cd because it has all the big hits I remember. It brings back memories of the old days and is worth purchasing.
3,Pretty good ...,"this book was obviously well researched, but i wouldn't say it was well written. i actually wonder if it was even edited ... but the plot is quite applicable to today's situations."
4,Got the job done,The only problem I had was the time it took to get to my house. Other than that it was great and i received a lot of wood.
1,Waste of Money!!!,"I think, its one of those books which are useless and less informative... yes it has unique visual appeal but thats not new now, since the age of photoshop all desktop artists are experimenting Design, Type and Photography...So thats what you will find in this book, after every 2 months i try to open it and try to make any sense of this huge,heavy dumb book...but invain. I think its better to buy his previous books rather than buying TREK or TRAP.Its Sick!"
4,Excellent low-profile cover,"This cover is durable and seals the bed well, heavy rain or a car wash will still get some water in along with a heavy amount of moisture. The cover looks great cause it sits fairly low. Installation into my Line-X lined bed was very easy.I take one star off because I do not see why this product should cost so much money, it is a couple rails and tubes strapped to a heavy glorified tarp. There isn't much to do about it, any name brand cover costs a hefty price for what it is."
4,great sequel,"Grew up watching the sandlot, love this sequel with some of the old characters. Would def. Recommend this movie to watch with the kiddos."
2,"CO2, but needs an adapter..., ???","So I ordered these as maintenance as recommended for the defender Mosquito Magnet..., low and behold they do not attach to the unit and are therefore useless..., UNLESS you spend another much larger chunk of change to get the adapter, which they do not tell you you need..., the adapter is way overpriced, and only at one supplier here on Amazon..., someone should link the items together so you know you need both.., I would not have ordered these if I had known."
5,masterpiece,"Everything Springsteen did after this sounds derivative. It's all here. The stories, the loss, the double entendres, the road, the clever work play, the hope. With this album, Springsteen painted his masterpiece."
2,"Working class hero first, songwriter....uh...seventh or so..",He's The Boss. Spokeman for the underdogs and working class. Great. But it doesn't excuse the fact that he can't write a melody to save his life and he sings out of tune.
4,Come out tonight and buy this album,"Truly one of Bruce's most under-rated albums. There was life before BORN TO RUN, and ROSILITA is here to prove it. ROSILITA is my all time favorite Bruce song, even though I was not alive when it first came out. I don't know what to say that hasn't allready been said by the other reviewers, except that those of you out there who think that GLORY DAYS is an early Bruce song don't know what you are missing."
3,In transition,"With WILD, Springsteen continues his evolution from a talented but needlessly verbose songwriter to the confident genius of BORN TO RUN. Unlike his first album where Springsteen had to fill every blank space with words; he allows the music carry some of the emotional weight. But words do fly fast and free whether we're hearing about Wild Billy's bizarre carnival or the depressing seaside romance(?) on the 4th of July. There is more passion found here than on ASBURY, but it's out of control. With epic lengths that don't match the content, Springsteen could have used some editing here, but it really is all part of the growing process that made him one of rock's true talents."
2,disappointed,"We just bought a ping-pong table and needed some racquets quick. I picked these because the price was right & the reviews were great. We played for a few minutes with them the day they arrived. The NEXT day, my son pointed out that one of the layers of wood was already peeling back from from one of the racquets.I do agree with the other reviewer that stated the racquets are heavy. If they weren't coming apart, I'd say they were a nice racquet for the price."
3,Very basic,"The book was fine, but clearly aimed at the non-accountant. As a CPA that was new to the construction industry, I was looking for something that would help with areas unique to the field. This book is more of an introduction to accounting for contractors."
3,I confused this LINER w the carpad itself because of the picture,"I mistakenly ordered this because it looks like the thing I set out to buy, namely the carpad itself with its raised edges to contain melted snow and dirt. In fact it's simply a cover to place over an existing carpad, and only useful if you have studded tires.I called the manufacturer and they told me this mistake has happened to several Amazon customers."
4,Atmospheric Bob,"This album has been kicked around by a lot a ""Bob"" purists which is a crime.PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID is the perfect partner for the movie.KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR portrays a gutshot lawman whose life is slowly slipping away.BILLY shows the clash between the old west and the new;the free to roam cowboy versus the greedy landowners.Just close your eyes and the music takes you to Fort Sumner and the Texan/Mexican border area.While there is only a little of Dylan's lyrical genius on show, there is plenty of musical talent to entertain us."
2,Disappointed,"The heating element didn't work at all. The massaging controls worked well. Even though a bit noisy, you get used to them. I returned this for a different product. I ordered the Wagan IN9738-5, also from Amazon, as the replacement and it's great!"
2,This seat cushion is meh...,"This cushion seems to have been very cheaply built. It's uncomfortable to sit on because the vibrators poke into your back. The heat is weak. The vibration was actually kind of nice while it was on. 1 week after we had this, the cigarrette lighter charger broke. I'm not even going to waste my time trying to replace it or have it fixed. Junk."
3,broke on me had to buy new car plug in,"This is awesome for your car but after 3 weeks, didn't use it daily, the plug to my cigarette lighter broke into pieces! Had to spend $15.00 at radio shack for adapter and new plug bc would have cost more to ship it back, would spend more on a better one."
5,Peace and beauty,This book is a must.I demand one for every home! No better way to escape reality and enter;if only for a moment the mind of a beautiful man and artist. His talent explodes from the pages!!
5,"Sad story of a beautiful, dying culture","This is a beautiful tribute to the bayou land culture of south Louisiana. I grew up in Thibodaux. Bayou Lafourche runs through Thibodaux. What was once a main ""highway"" between the Mississippi River in Donaldsonville and the Gulf, is now stagnant large ditch until south of Raceland. The Louisiana marshes are disappearing at an alarming rate and everyone in America will pay the price for having ignored this problem. Tidwell published the book in 2003, two years before Katrina and three years after another prescient book, John M. Barry's ""Rising Tide."" Now Hurricane Isaac has no doubt destroyed more of the marshes that serve as the first - and most important - line of defense against the tidal surges for south Louisiana.Please read the book. Please visit the area. Drive to Grand Isle on Highway 1. It is fast disappearing and already a raised highway is needed to connect the area to the mainland.God save the Bayou Land and those who live on it and off it."
3,ash bucket,"i bought this ash bucket for the use of my wood stove; so far so good. we had only filled it half ways, not too cold yet here to really fill it to max capacity. hopefully will hold the use over the winter."
2,Lower the IQ of any social gathering,"The entire faculty has gathered at the university president's home. Whip out one of these Mad LIb books and suddenly it looks like a busload of 4th graders. If the people aren't as bright to start with, well, just do the math, if you are capable after prolonged exposure to Mad Libs.I added the second star because one can often find copies of these used wherein a witty ex-academic or eight year-old has pencilled in vaguely smutty words. Instant folk art. And quiet, too."
2,"More research, please.","Exit earth has good writing and character development, but he really should have done more research for the science in the book. The density of the dust cloud, the lightening bolt to the space station and the moon, etc. are in the realm of fantasy. Besides, the spaceship, as described, wouldn't even have gotten out of the solar system before turning back."
2,tarp,"This is a tarp to cover part of a swing set. It is a cheap plastic material. It rips and deteriorates every year and has to be replaced. I don't want my yard looking like a slum, so I have to buy one every year."
3,Good price but not that impressed,This tarp is just ok overall. The one we received was slightly off kilter so it didn't lay quite right when it was up. We had to compensate by folding one corner under to be able to pull it tight. I think I'd consider paying more and getting the heavy duty one next time.
1,Photo Misrepresentation,"The photo of the tarp that you see in the picture is not what you will receive in the mail. The photo in the advertisement shows (4) stripes, but what you actually get is (3) stripes - 1 blue, 1 green, 1 yellow. The photo is much prettier!"
5,Best option for the expensive tarps,"We have a high end rainbow system.. to replace the tarp was over $500... so I got 2 of these and made it work.. the width is perfect, but one makes it up one side, so you need one more to go down the back side. It has been through hurricane Sandy and the winter and hasn't ripped or sagged. Great alternative to the rainbow!!"
5,Better than original,I haven't installed the canopy yet but the material is much stronger than the original one that came with our playground. I'm excited to replace it along with the replacement swings we purchased.
5,This is a great paintball gun! and I hope you like it to!!!,"This gun has great accuracy and speed my brother has welt's from this gun I've won every round and I just started. The mask is great just wear a beanie or something so a paintball won't skim you're head. There's a cleaner to clean you're gun just pop it through you're place we're you put the hopper on and it will come through the muzzle (the most dangerous part of the gun never point it at someone) and pull it out. There's two tubes that hold 100 paintball's each (remember you're neck guard guys) though they were no use to me, but ,could to you, I guess? But if you are safe with you're paintball gun everything will be ok. So go have fun and be safe."
5,My book,"This is clearly the best book I've written so far and warmly recommend it to anybody interested in dynamical systems, integrability theory, Painleve theory and normal forms.A must read!"
3,"""Above Average""","I really don't know what to comment coz I was trying to figure out his odd timings and intervals, but I really admire the stage presence of Mike. Very expressive though. It is a good DVD if you love to experiment and analyse odd time signatures on the stick."
4,Purchased for a gift,We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our 5-1/2 year old granddaughter. She was not impressed but we like the concept of putting these Johnson's ( a brand we trust) bath time essentials together in a basket.
4,No Hippo!,"Okay products, but ordered specifically because I wanted to replace the blue hippo my little one LOVES, that was in the first one purchased. NO Hippo! :( Don't even need the products."
3,Great product.. but..,"This is a good product since its from a reputable company, but this particular set doesnt include baby oil like my last one."
5,A Complete Baby Bath Kit!,"A perfect little kit. Although I did not register for this, it was given to me as a gift, and it's great. All you need in a handy basket, including an adorable little ducky."
5,guitarshardthudzipbang w/ ultra eww vox!,this record only becomes terrifyingly incredible once you realize that they do in fact know EXACTLY what they're doing; they reportedly replicate this stuff live too... *shiver*
4,2-pac kicks a**,"Hello everyone,if you like 2-pac then get his cd if you were wondering if your parents would get you this cd,they might not because its viewer digrestion advised."
3,2pac's greatest hits.....,"alrite, so many people hail 2pac as the greatest rapper of all time. i can see why. he does have SOME skill, which is more than any other mainstream rappers out there rite now. that aside, he is far from the best. there are so many other rappers out there with much more talent than 2pac. all in all good for mainstream rap, but if u want some real good hip hop look into the underground to groups such as atmosphere, the hieroglyphics, living legends, aesop rock, jedi mind tricks, and sage francis. all of these emcees are a lot more talented than 2pac could ever have hoped to be."
5,Greatest Hits from The Greatest,Some may like the early work from Pac but this is the collection and includes some early work and the last. You can't buy this album and ecpect to get to enoy all the magic this rapper gave the world. So buy them all!
4,"A Real Life Story teller, with no Holds Bar. . . 2 Pac","This album illustrates the gansta lifestyle. Although much of the music is hard-core rap, its blend of soul and lyrics worked well. 2 Pac is a lyrical poet, telling stories of the hood. His choices of words are extreme, but his boyhood environment was also extreme. You can also hear growth in his music. His earlier release being much more hostile, and oppose to his recent music becoming more positive and talking of change. Did 2 Pac change as the years went by?"
5,2pacs GREATEST HITS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER,"2Pac Shakur, one of the most contriversial rappers ever has had success since day one, after his tragic death on Sept, 13, 1996 Tupac has became more and more popular. There has been albums released after his death including MAKAVELLI, RU STILL DOWN, GRST HITS, IN HIS OWN WORDS ETC.... THIS album rules add it to your collection of the greatest music ever...if only tupac was still alive to make more and more hits. RIP TUPAC SHAKUR FEB , 1999...from a loving fan"
1,ABOSLUTELY TERRIBLE,"""I ain't a killa but don't push me(...)What a charming man tupac was!Ok, the alubm was awful, boring, un-imaginative, tedious 'beats', and the same for the lyrics.tupac was not a musicain, he never broke into actuall singing in the album, and he can not play an instrument, yet some people regard him as a musician.he was hailed as a poet, for his so-called deep lyrics. which are in fact offensive, and crude. Serioulsy though guys, if you want some poetry, try ben jonson, robert browning, shakespeare not this clown tupac.how is this album classed as music, have out standards, just hit rock-bottom?tupac was a self confessed thug, but people bought his albums, what next a serial killer releasing an albumtupacs songs where just one big ego trip for himthese are his greatest hits i dread to think about his 'not so good ones'"
5,This CD is great! All the best of his songs in two CDs!,"If you love Tupac's music and you don't have this album now, BUY IT! You will not regret it!"
3,HE IS WHAT X-PRESSING DOES TO MUSIC,WOW DOOR.WHAT A MAN.I CANT BELIEVE WHAT I HEAR.HE X-PRESSIS WHAT HES THINKING SO HOT.WITH THOSE DOPE BEATS AND NUTTY LYNCH LYRICS. THIS IS WHAT HIP HOP NEEDS NOW. A RAPPER HOW DOESNT CARE ABOUT BEIN A MUMMYS BOY OR RESPECTING WOMEN............R.....I.......P...............WATCH OUT FOR DIZZIE HES LYRICS ARE JUST AS TOUCHING IN A WAY
5,Best compilation of his work to date,"I used to think that ""All eyes on my"" was the most important hip hop album ever made especially since his death in 1996, but now I cannot go anywhere without the greatest hitz cd. It just puts everything that was good about him into two cd's. There are different hits for different areas and times in his life, it ranks as the best overall hiphop cd out there, a true collectors item."
5,Great Collection of Pac songs,"I think this is a real good collection of 2pac songs but i had other favorites like Only God Can Judge Me, Krazy, and a few others. This is still a classic rap album and 2pac is a very talented poet and rapper. many educated blacks look up to Tupac Amaru Shakur as their role model. My favorites off this album are Changes, Hail Mary, Life Goes On, I ain't Mad at Cha, and 2 of Amerikkaz most wanted. So if you are a fan of rap, or any kind of music you should pick this collection of songs up."
5,excellent compilation,A wide range of 2Pac's hits and lesser knowns. I've been looking for a compliation like this for quite some time.
5,2Pac - Greatest Hits,"This is quite potentially the greatest album of all time! Along with fresh, unreleased tracks such as ""Changes"", i must warn all that this album will have you hooked! Along with Until the End of Time and Better Day'z, this is the best 2Pac release.J-Vidi's Top Tracks:* Changes* Hit Em' Up* 2 of America's Most Wanted* Calafornia Love"
5,Outstanding1,"This book was recommended by a friend, and I have to say I am eternally grateful to her. I couldn't put it down. Ms. Orenstein writes with compassion and understanding of the complexities which bind and separate people. And in a single paragraph I was often moved to both laughter and tears.In addition to a compelling plot -- a young man who is jailed and then seemly disappears (the book is also a bit of a mystery story!) -- the author rights authoritatively about Alaska, making you almost believe you have visited the town of Bethel, and have wandered its street, and feel your heart tugged by the relentless poverty and isolation. More than anything, she writes of the terrible toll this takes on the children, who have no escape.READ THIS BOOK! I hope it finds its way into many hands, and that the author receives the recognition she deserves. Barbara Johnson"
2,Nice form - but definitely not great at any one thing.,"I had to double check the label as I was under the impression that this camera was an HD (720p) camera. Well I guess there are no requirements or guidelines for marketing a camera as HD. The first thing I did when I received this camera was shoot some HD footage and then watch it on my HD tv. Boy - was I surprised. The footage looked awful. To be honest I have seen regular cameras and even cell phones that could give the video feature a run for it money.The standard photos looked pretty good, but shutter lag was a pain. The only reason I rated this camera a 2 is that the form factor was great and it is a good idea. Needless to say this camera was returned the very next day."
3,significant aliasing effect for still images > 1280 x 780,"The still images greater than 1280 x 780 taken by this camcorder has strong aliasing effect,and the sharp edges in the scene are very diluted.The file sizes for higher-resolution (1280 x 780) images are significantly smallerthan those taken taken by an ordinary camera.This means that a higher-resolution image does not contain enough information than it should contain.The resolution of the CCD is much hyped that it should be,and taking pictures that are larger than 1280 x 780 does not make any sense,since the quality of the images is so bad."
4,This is REAL R & B music,"The Isley Brothers 3+3 has some very tight rhythms. The drums are kickin' and the grooves are slammin'. I noticed that in the other reviews, no one mentioned the very last song, ""Highways of Life"". That song, along with ""Summer Breeze"" are beautifully arranged. Brother-in-law Chris Jasper demonstrates his classical background, especially on these pieces, while Ernie displays his Hendrix influence. Play this album, Live It Up, and The Heat Is On back to back and you'll see the progression of their talent."
2,Birthday present,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday.The only song on this album worth listening to is piano man....I recommend a greatest hits album.
4,sing us a song,"I can't believe Billy Joel's Piano Man hasn't become a classic album that everyone needs to own. We're talking about a solid collection of songs. Some of the songs here sound like something Barry Manilow would do, except of course, in the typical Billy Joel songwriting style.""worse comes to worse"" HAS to be one of his most underrated songs. I love that one. ""captain jack"" is another song I can listen to over and over and get caught up in the smokey atmosphere and quiet vocals, until the loud chorus comes crashing in. It's awesome.I also love ""travelin' prayer"". It reminds me of ""the entertainer"". Maybe it influenced that song, I don't know.The only reason I didn't give Piano Man 5 stars is because the title song is a bit overplayed, and I'm tired of it. It doesn't really interest me anymore. I understand it was the song to turn Billy Joel into a worldwide phenomenon, but I don't care for it much anymore. The rest of the album rules."
2,Rather disapointing,"I bought this cd soley for the title song, Piano Man, which I think is absolutely fantastic. However, I was very disapointed with the rest of this cd. I've listened to it a hundred times, but I just can't get into any of the songs except Piano Man. I wasn't impressed by the rest of the selection."
2,Horrible version of a Great Album,"Just walk away from it unless you can get an original vinyl or a decent CD. The mastering is horrible on this version. I have the original vinyl, but it's really seen better days so I thought I'd get a ""cleaner"" version.Wow, was that a mistake! The original vinyl, scratches and all, is far superior to this copy of a copy of a copy. The songs have been transferred either too fast or too slow. At first I thought it was my hearing, but when I compared the original to the new one I could definitely hear the difference. Very disappointed in this purchase."
4,I'm with the 4 stars on this one,"It's Billy Joel, great music, but thought the SACD could have been better.Found the Turnstiles SACD worth a 5 star rating.If you can find ""The Stranger"" in 5.1, that's the best SACD out there of Billy Joel'sThey need to do more multichannel versions, his music is definitely worth the effort"
4,"""Piano Man"" was a step higher from ""Cold Spring Harbor""","I think that in ""Piano Man"" (two years after debut album ""Cold Spring Harbor"") was an interesting album. In 1973, Billy Joel was trying to flee from a record manager who was raking in Billy Joel's cash. Billy Joel figured that if he left for a while, Artie Ripp (the record manager) would figure that he is not going to get any cash out of Billy Joel. Billy worked at Piano Bar, a small bar in Los Angeles. That job made the song ""Piano Man"", a true story about Piano Bar. There, he went by the name of Bill Martin (Martin is his middle name). His voice had improved and he continued his wonderful piano playing. From the moving notes of ""Piano Man"" to the devastating story in ""Captain Jack"", Billy Joel made a great album."
3,Playmobil Airport,"Complex and long project, hard to enjoy the time trying to build it together when the child expects it ready in 2 minutes and just wants to grab the parts and start to play. However, once built provides hours of imaginative play on a regular basis, at least for 6 mos. We really enjoyed just playing with the Jet more."
3,Great Matches Ruined by Digital Covering,"I am one of Mick Foley's biggest fans, but WWE ruined some classic matches with the poor digital covering of the old WWF symbol.It was impossible not to notice all the blurred-out symbols, and try as hard as I could, I couldn't enjoy the matches affect.The matches are great, but I won't be buying WWE home videos from now on -- not until this practice of blurring out the WWF symbols ends."
4,Delightfully Silly,"Not a great work, Zar und Zimmermann is nonetheless an entertaining opera. In the hands of Rolf Liebermann, it's actually a delight. The young and nubile Lucia Popp is, as always, marvelous. It's possible this is the earliest footage of her we have. All the singing is quite good.The highlight of the entire production is the hilarious choral directing scene. If you have ever sung in a choir, you'll be in stitches. The usually somber Hans Sotin is in wonderful voice and is very funny as the simpleton mayor-cum-choral director. This famous scene is outstanding - the chorus acts and sings extremely well. But it's Hans Sotin who makes the entire performance memorable with his satirical and exaggerated spoof of the archetypal choir director. I watched that one scene many times over and for that alone this DVD was a good investment. It's rare to find an opera on DVD that can actually make me laugh, but this one did!"
5,Any guitarist would want to be remembered like this....,"Truly an amazing DVD! Just one correction to a previous review, from the biographies I've read, SRV's didn't get clean and sober until 1986/87."
5,Excellent stories,This is part of a series that is very suitable for teen readers. As an adult reader it is enjoyable. Great as a set for gifts.
4,Great summer book.,Book arrived in a couple of days just as promised in great condition. It a great summer read.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Menolly is now at the Harper Hall. However, she is a geek/nerd and doesn't fit in with all the girls who like doing the standard chick things. Plus there just happens to be a bunch of fire lizards following her around.She also has to deal with the problem of choosing or being asked to choose a specialisation and someone to be a mentor."
1,Not worth it,This book was not at all what I was expecting and not in the good way. There were certain parts of the book that just didn't make any sense and didn't have any fluidity. At times it seems as if the author knew where she was going but didn't display that to the reader.
2,Don't want to hurt the author's feelings...,"Because I gather this is a first book. But the dialog in this book was weak, the humor adolescent, and the characters very similar. You know it's a bad sign when the author needs to tell you when the character is telling a joke. It's even worse when the author does it over and over, and you're not laughing. The jokes were mostly puns and cliches (on the level of ""don't assume, it makes an..."" come on!), and self-conscious ""bedroom"" talk, where the characters literally get embarrassed for using the word ""bed"" in mixed company. No, I'm not kidding. This is a contemporary romance about a divorcee and a widower! That said, the clean prose and light-hearted tone saved the book from getting 1 star."
5,MUCH more than a romance!,"A quick, engaging read! It's definitely a romance novel - filled with sexual tensions and innuendos, but even most of that is in fun, verbal banter...More importantly, there are SO MANY REAL-LIFE THEMES running through the book at the same time:* wanting more time with significant others,* wanting more time for our kids,* professionals (men and women) and their conflict to achieve at work and be supportive at home, and* the ever-present need for good friends to confide in!I introduced this book at a women's discussion group (where we're mostly in our 30's and 40's), and we spent the majority of the time talking about these vital issues that hit so close to home for all of us!Don't let the pink cover and the romance packaging fool you, this fun book offers lots for thinking women to mull over, too!"
5,Very useful when traveling!,"This is a handy tool if you ever leave the house with a bottle-fed kid. It heats the bottle up roughly as quickly as a bowl of warm water, and the unit knows when to turn off as well as the heat required for the size of bottle you are warming. Gets the job done, not much more needs to be said than that."
4,All good but the Battery Cover keeps falling off,"Everything was good, we got one part that was the wrong part, but after 2 emails they send the correct part to me. The only problem is while I have the large battery on there with the large battery cover,the battery cover keeps slipping off. I've solved this by putting tape on it for now."
5,"Beautiful, high quality necklace","""My sterling silver four leaf clover and peridot necklace is beautiful! It's really high quality and I've had so many compliments on it already. I like the way the clasp hooks in front...that's really cool. I am very happy with this purchase!"""
5,Heart touching and eye opening,"This book is full of emotions that a girl goes through when she has been taken advantage of by an older man. I guess this book is so mind-provoking because I know the author personally. She is a dear friend of mine and I know that she put a lot of tears and time into this book. This is her way of dealing with this incident. Now she is doing well, thankfully. Anyway, read this book if you like poetry that is slightly erotic and emotionally provoking."
4,Built in lithium battery won't charge.,"I have had this device for 3 days. I had it plugged into a power outlet for 9 hours before I started using it, but the battery wasn't working. I called Philips customer service and they are FedExng me a new one. When I receive the replacement, they said I canjust send back the one I got no charge.On power, this device works great. I am actually quite impressed at the picture quality for DVD player and how the ipod videos look. It took me a while to figure out how to get the widescreen ipod videos to look ""normal"" on the screen intead of all squished. I don't have too many ipod videos with 16:9 aspect ratio. If the battery arrived in working condition, I would give this 5 stars."
4,Great player especially for the price,"As person who travels a lot, I'm always looking for something to pass the time in airports, trains, cars, etc. And I saw this for sale at Circuit City I had to go check it out. This is a nice little unit. It plays DVDs, Ipod video, inputs from a secure digital card, and plays dvix .avi files. WOW and for a price of $139.00 I picked one up. My previous DVD player was a Toshiba, and the sound was poor, this one has great sound, I can actually hear it without having headphones in. And the color is crisp, and clean. I like it! I can't believe the deal for the price. Most other DVD players without having access to Ipod video, is around $200."
5,Great Product,"This player brings my iPod video to life. I got tired of headphones and the small screen for viewing my podcasts. This player brings my video podcasts to life and plays DVDs pretty well, especially self-burned DVDs. Highly recommended."
2,Colors are washed out,The color on mine was washed out. Brightess control does not help. Video does not work with fourth gen Nano.
4,Not a how to book,"I enjoyed reading the book, but if you are just learning I'd chose something else to read. This book is more about what Wicca means to her."
3,Nice Piece but doesn't shave well,"I got the 1904 a few weeks ago, and I must say I'm disappointed with the shave of this razor. First, I must say I received it very quickly. The shipping was extremely fast. Also, it's a very nice razor. The stubby handle doesn't bother me. It's design is simple and nice to look at.I was really excited to shave with it, but was highly disappointed in the shave. I've had better shaves using my gf's 2month old leg shaving disposable. An electric would give a closer shave. I'm hoping it's just the Merkur blades, and just ordered some feathers, but I think they come in a standard size and if anything, I think the razor's guard is too wide, not exposing enough blade to get a close shave.It's a really nice razor, and I hope it's just a blade issue, but out of the box, I have to give it two stars because of the horrible shave.60wt"
3,Looks nice,"This razor looks classy as can be, bottom line though, it doesn't shave as close as my other razors. I really wanted to love this thing. Too bad that compared to the Merkur slant bar it shaves like you are using an actual butter knife. I'll keep it for the looks."
1,Outakes better than the episodes,"Well, after enjoying BBC videos such as Ballykissangel, Doc Martin, Foyle's war and Upstairs/Downstairs, I decided to go for a comedic series. I was very disappointed.It's simply a collection of non-interconnected TV episodes of three dysfunctional characters with utterly simplistic storylines but with a biting, caustic narrative.For the few laughs I got from it (no one else in the family found the series tolerable) it certainly wasn't worth the price.Just wasn't humorous to me."
5,Best show EVER!,"Black Books is one of my favorite shows of all time. It's witty, funny, and loveable. While the plot reads out to be kind of boring, Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey are absolutely histerical and have such great chemistry. Black Books is a bit offbeat, so I guess it takes a couple episodes to get into, but if you're already a fan of such movies as Run Fatboy Run, Shaun of the Dead, or Hot Fuzz, you'll love this show.Also, while the extra features are few, each of the series has a set of outtakes which are extremely funny, as well as some cast commentary, and series 3 has deleted scenes. My only complaint is that they only made 3 seasons!"
2,Great 'til it breaks,"WE bought these grabbers and they worked really well until the very thin wire which connects the handle to the tong broke at the connection to the handle. I cannot see any way to repair them so into the trash they must go. A heavier duty connection rod would make this a great product!Landmann 35 Inch Log Grabber, Black"
5,the boy friend,"It IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE!Unluckily, as the copy has no Spanish surtitles,most of the wonderful dialogues ( I know them by the VHS copy)are lost for not English speaking people.Hope some days a copy with Spanish surtitles willbe realeased."
2,My son likes it but ......,"In another review it said you need good lighting. This is very true. If you turn it up to high resolution, you need all the more light. I misread the ad and thought the camera maintained 30 fps at all resolutions. I WAS WRONG!!! My son likes the camera, so I'm not going to complain. If it was for me, though, I'd send it back in a heartbeat, just because of the misleading ad. The sound quality (when files are moved to the computer) is pretty good. The software for transferring the files to the computer is glitchy at best. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it loads and says that there's no camera connected. Funny thing is, windows explorer has no problem seeing it (and what caused the program to auto-launch in the first place?) and moving the files. I went to the manufacturer's website and found the software and drivers had not been updated since 2003. To be honest I am very disappointed, even at the price I paid. But, again, my son likes it."
2,Should Have listened To Other Reviews,"Mustek's customer service is ""OFF THE HOOK"" literally..They can't be reached...I returned the 3500 to HSN..Ohh AMAZON,,I came accross a gem by the name of ""Daisy Multimedia"" model DM334..(U should invest in these guys,,REALLY!!!)They are out of Europe but the cameras are BANGIN'and really blow MUSTEK out of the game.. MP3s ,,video,storage, ect,,the Daisy DM334 has it all...Mustek was a BIG MUSTAKE!!!!"
2,Nice try.....Not so nice buy...,"Got the dv3500(funny how this model is never mentioned) from HSN(they should be ashamed for selling this thing..They'd better look out for a flood of returns after the holiday...REALLY!!)..Man the pictures are not good (even for a low price camera)..Mass Storage is good... What really got to me is when the mp3 player repeatedly locked up..I had to open the battery cover to restart the machine only to have it lock up many more times..This could be a GREAT machine if MUSTEK!!!! could put ""REAL"" brains behind this product(their customer non-support is just that) ..If MUSTEK is gonna make something,DO IT RIGHT or just leave the game to the big boys (Panasonic,Sony,ect)..I'd rather pay $100 more for a multifunction camera that WORKS...After returning this one,,I will.(Panasonic??)"
1,indeed terrible,"Have to rate this product as ""ZERO"" star.It's a sleek / pretty product.But don't get me wrong ! The most important thing is the quality --very Horrible !!!Resolution is 2Mpix (2 CMOS) not 4Mpix.but it works like 0.3 Mpix only. (Oh!! My dear God)Pictures are always blurry (even if you use a tripod)and color is not right (too yellow or too red)Don't buy it..."
3,"not the best, but not the worst","i bought this camera a year ago, and it still amazes me. you can do movies (with a considerable resolution at 30 fps) take photos up to 4 mbpixels use it as an mp3 player or a sound recorder.cons: no flash and blurry pictures (makes the photo function nearly useless); making movies in low light places is almost impossible.For it's price, its a nice camera, but i'd wait until the DV-5000 comes out. it'll cost more but it corrects some of the problems of the 4000 model, such as the flash, ccd sensor instead of cmos (drastically improves the quality of the images, making it viable to take photos with the camera) and a nifty 2.5 inch movable lcd."
2,g,"I was shopping for a compact digital camcorder and seen this camcorder advertised recently on a shopping network. I purchased the camcorder because of the very small size (the size of a credit card-no kidding!) and the many features expecially the mp3 player. I received the camcorder today and I am having so much fun exploring the many functions (camcorder/still camera/mp3 player/pc cam and voice recorder)....Also, the camcorder is so easy to operate and takes decent video. When I'm done I can just slip the camcorder into my shirt pocket. There are better camcorders on the market, but for this exceptional low price, it serves my function for a compact digital camcorder/still camera that I could carry to my child's many sporting and school events and listen to music."
1,can there be negative stars????,"If your like to here people tuning thier guitars and hitting random drums in a somewhat syncronized order, then this record is for you!"
1,Terrible company,"Really, beware of ordering from them.I ordered 2 items - I did receive one, it took almost two months, but OK. As one reviewer wrote, it is heavy plastic with 4 plastic ""hoses."" You decide if it's worth $180.Then, when the second item came, 2 months later, it was the wrong item - a small carpad that I cannot use. The company nevertheless charged me $80, the price of the item I originally ordered, whereas the item I was sent is priced at $38 on their website. I sent 3 emails - no reply. I left several telephone messages. No replies. This was in June. I called again July 19, another answering machine, no human being. This company has overcharged me for something I never even ordered, and six weeks later they still have not rectified this. I'm now dealing with Visa to dispute the charge. Carpad seems to be on the brink. Don't deal with them."
5,Ken Vandermark DOES NOT play on this album,"Amazon have made a big mistake by saying that this album is by 'Ken Vandermark and the Flying Luttenbachers'. (Either that or it's a cheap marketing ploy). Vandermark had left the Luttenbachers years before this album was made and he was only ever in the band marginally. Also, the band on this record is totally different from earlier lineups (with the exception of mainstay/leader Weasel Walter) and a good part of the music is metal/grindcore-influenced (unlike the previous albums), mixed in with the Luttenbachers' unique no wave sound. The horns on this album (and they're only on two tracks) are played by Weasel Walter and, I believe, the late Bill Pisarri. It's an incredible record, one of the very best Luttenbachers titles."
4,Tiny but nice,"I got married on 7/7/7 so I thought that this would be fitting (Lucky 7). I was only a little disappointed by the size, however this piece is very nice and feminine."
3,Disappointed,"My item came to me in proper timing however I was disappointed when I opened it to find a blackish liquid substance like an oil covering three out of four balls wrapped in the hard plastic. Not thinking I opened the package and washed the balls. Upon examination there were a few small cracks in several of the balls which I don't believe that is where the substance came from but after reading where there were from, China, I should have not opened them because of the highly suspect and low quality China is capable of exporting. I would have returned them but since I had opened them I forfeited on sending them back."
1,Low-quality,I bought this set to give as a gift. The balls seem very light and the carrying bag they came in was of REALLY terrible quality. It was ripped in two places when it arrived.
3,There are better sets out there.,"I mean, you can play bocce with these, but I would get a different set if I could do it over again."
5,Slow getting assembled,"It arrived 10/24 ""beat-to-death"" by looking at the box, it took me over 1 week to open and check it out as our schedules & watching baby leave very little time . . .Now I've managed to build a bench in my shop & have it mostly assembled. The 4"" hose clamp stripped when tightened, so I had to get new one-Stainless Steel.Just mounted laser unit last night, but no time for battery & alignment . . .All told, the box/packaging DID IT'S JOB, many others said the same. It all seems intact, can't wait to flip the switch, the instructions are pretty easy-makes it childs play so long as you can read.Hope to update when I DO get it plugged in. Need to beef up the bench, because it is heavy- hopefully this weekend as I have numerous projects on hold for this baby . . . BUY IT!"
3,just ok,"I bought this since it was the cheapest transmitter I could find. Maxell usually makes good accessories, but this one was not one of their better products. Although I could listen to music on my mp3 player, I couldn't put the player down while driving. I had to hold it while driving with one hand to get the best possible sound! Otherwise all I heard was static. Also, why does this small device need 3 AAA batteries? Kind of odd in my opinion. There's an on/off switch that you shouldn't forget about either or the batteries will drain. I'm probably going to buy a new one soon."
3,"Great classic, VERY poorly transcribed","The book deserves five stars. The transcription, however, renders it almost unreadable. No wonder that other reviewer felt he should offer the author a hint. If you thought it was a modern work, you'd naturally think it needed editing in a big way. Not only is the formatting painful and the text full of typos, but the science is hideously outdated (it was first published in 1949).If you're familiar with Leinster's work, you'll know these are not his errors. But because of them, this is very hard to read. If you're considering this as your first Leinster, I cannot strongly enough recommend that you start elsewhere, or with a different transcription of this book. This novel is a fine sample of his work, but not in this hideously mangled format."
1,Idiot Wind,"This is the single-worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of watching. It is not horrifying, it is not compelling. It is not intelligent. I find it very hard to believe that the good reviews are legitimate. The movie stars out with an interesting introduction, and then turns into a high-school-film-class quality production. there is no story to speak of, the acting was bad, the directing was bad, the editing was terrible. Certain scenes were remarkably drawn out into unbearable torture (the scene with the female character loping gaily through a field, for example). Yeah, I ""get"" the point of the movie. You don't have to be an Einstein to figure out that Mongillo was aiming toward some kind of Lord of the Flies psyche piece, but it fails miserably.I will now risk being cliched and say, ""The Wind Blows!"""
1,not a nice man. not a great writer either.,"So Peter Trachtenberg has alienated his parents, his friends, most of the women he's been involved with -- everyone except his tattooist (maybe because she's gay). He is a profoundly self-indulgent man. A few shocking ""thrills"" here, but that's about it."
4,Too fun to be true,"Contrary To Popular Belief is a simple book with facts virtually nobody knows. Flip open to any page and learn something new just for fun! Not all facts are equally interesting, but worth the money nonetheless.4 stars :D"
2,Typical Academic Verse,"Like most academic poets, Logan fails to transcend the petty boundaries of the incestuous world of MFA programs and the petty egos and infantile personalities ruling that world. One sees flashes of brilliance in Logan's work, but his poems are the poems of a man who is always looking over his shoulder, always striving to impress, always terrified of what the hacks in the world of academia think of him."
3,Havent caught anything yet.,"I've laid about half of these down, and the rodent seems to smell and avoid them. Sticky as hell, granted; but will not catch anything without bait, as claimed. The whole house smelled like ""almost"" peanut-butter for days. Not using this again."
3,si belt,It is helpful but I was not aware of the two strips of silicon to help hold it in place. I cannot be moved if it gets out of place without undoing it all together and repositioning it. Also these strips cause it to roll in-half causing discomfort at times.Your speed in getting the product to me was great. I do wish you would ship to Guam (US Territory). Other companies do and I had to pay shipping twice in order to receive it.thank you!
4,Above Average,"This book is an interesting collection of well-known and lesser-known authors of short stories, plays, poetry and essays. All works of writing portray the lives of colored women. It is a varied group of writers who really, have little in common. However, the book is lacking a cohesive momentum that it was probably trying to achieve. Interesting addition to a book collection."
2,Not particularly clear it was VHS,"Wanted a DVD, not a VHS, so was a little disappointed. It's my own fault for not reading carefully. Good postage, especially considering was before Christmas."
1,brockway trucks 1948-1961 photo archive,"Many errors as far as picture to captions ,no chronological order,overall you look at it once and thats enough."
3,"okay, not great","This book is alright. There are some good love scenes, but like I've found with most Norah Hess books, there is not much depth to this book. The characters just do not seem real to me. This book is a good read if you're bored."
5,Read This One It's a Real Find!,"The film is a neglected classic, and the novel it was inspired by is likewise. It will hook you as a good thriller does, yet also profoundly engage you with it's extraordinary mixture of the poetic and the grittily, absurdly real. The Characterisation is rich and broad and constantly surprising - tough yet warm - and it is stylistically muscular in a Chandleresque way, without ever becoming arch. Touching movingly on so many issues from some extremely archetypal relationships to the state of post-Vietnam America, Thornburg takes you on a rollercoaster ride that you won't want to get off. Finally, as an exploration of messed-up masculine insecurity it is devastating and compulsive with that rare thing in such books,great female characters! Read the book, see the film - you won't forget either."
4,Very good mouthpiece.,"Mouthpiece takes some getting used to, but afterwards, it works extremely well.The only reason why it's rated four stars is because the ligature that I am using doesn't fit that well on this mouthpiece. The ligature fits perfectly on my old one, just not this brand new.All in all, very nice mouthpiece. Recommend buying for intermediates."
2,romanticizing cultural anthropology,"The author provides an anthropological account of Huna- anthropological in the worst sense of the word, in my opinion. While she pays lipservice to the pitfalls of colonial romanticization of native Others, I found her account of ""Hawaiian spirituality"" to fall into that same trap. As others have pointed out, she provides some interesting linguistic interpretations, but the whole thing had an intrepid-New-Agey-European-explorer feel to it that I found really off-putting. In fact, nowhere in the book do I recall her pointing out that so-called Huna was in fact founded by non-Hawaiian folks. Strange, considering she has a doctorate in something called Hawaiian Shamanism."
2,Detailed but dissapointing,"Without doubt this book is impressive in its analysis of the Hawaiian language and culture. However, there is little real info on the actual practicalities of the Huna system other than to say that it can achieve various conditions.For me anyway, a far more insightful book is the original ""Kahuna magic"" by Brad Steigier and which describes Max Freedom Long's work. More to get your teeth into as such, than the poetic description of Dr Morrell.It doesn't ramble on the subject and gets to the extraordinary info quicker.In comparing Morrel's book with Steiger, I would say Romantic vs Descriptive."
2,Not as great as the infomerical says,Oh course you will have additional waste when you are taking an additional 30 pills of this stuff a day. The pills are big and the ingrediants expand in you. The black stuff they talk about in the infomerical is just all of the black charcoal tha is in the step one pills. It may clean you body good but not as dramatic as they claim. You can save about $40 and just buy a cleansing kit at any healthfood store for a little over $20.
4,"Decent, but much larger than I had anticipated","This thing is larger than I had thought. Wanted something not too big for the back of my smart fortwo convertible. This is nearly as wide as the car.People have talked about problems with the handle's telescoping locking pins and I can see that could be a potential issue, it's the one weak spot. But seems as if it should be fine as long as it's taken into consideration when being used. The shovel bit is solidly on there though.Bristles on the bottom, they are stiffer and bigger than I had thought, I'm not sure how well they'll work around things like wipers and such, since there's not much give. Looks like I'm still going to have to keep a brush handy anyway. But this will certainly get the piles off..."
5,This is the truth!,Brother Leonard hits it right on the head. In this book he contrasts Jesus' temptation period to the transfiguration. Many times we as Christians want a transfiguration experience without going through the fires of trial. This is a really good book to read if you are going through a dry time or a time in your life in which you need to be able to see the end. I highly recommend this book
3,It is a little difficult to read.,"I purchased my scope at Wal-Mart. It is small and very discreet. My only problem, aside from having difficulty reading it, is that you have to have saliva without bubbles. I just found that out and have wasted several months trying with false information. The package does not warn you about that, so you don't know it. Once I had it figured out, it is very easy. We'll see if it works for me."
4,Fun for New Hampshire folk!,"NH folks should check out this fun little locally produced campfest! It's got something for everyone: pop tunes, a murder mystery, a cute romance, monsters, basketball and more. It's a really fun and intentionally silly movie. Be sure to look for Marshall's (Matt Farley's) phone number in the end credits."
4,Textbook,"have not used it yet, but plan on using it in class a little bit. Professor said it was a hard read."
2,"Good for ice ONLY, not for regular scraping","I can't tell you how disappointing this thing has been. Unless there's a significant ice covering -- like 1/2 inch or more -- on our car, this does nothing. You can't use it as a scraper for regular ice because it doesn't make good contact with the windows. And it's not even that great for scraping ice. It works, but so do far cheaper scrapers. The $4 scraper from the gas station is just as good for scraping, AND for ice."
2,Difficult to use for song leading,"I found this electronic pitch pipe too difficult to use for song leading. You press a note to begin playing, then press the same note again to stop it. The buttons are difficult to press and do not always work. I have to use my fingernail to press them. The volume control tends to move all the way to off when I put the device in my pocket. When I pull it out and press a button, nothing happens, so I press it again. Then I turn the volume up. Still nothing (because I pressed the same button twice). Finally I press the button again and get blasted with a much louder sound than I had wanted!The buttons are arranged in two rows, but the positions are not intuitive. On the top row the next highest semitone (the sharp) for a note is to the right. On the botton it is to the left!With some redesign this could be a great instrument, but it isn't right now."
1,"Great book, Terrible Kindle version","My son loves this book but we both hate the Kindle version. He likes to touch the pictures in order to count the dogs etc and he can't do this because the screen changes. Because the text comes out so small, it is repeated in a larger font, which means that the text doesn't always match the picture on the screen, the words are repeated twice or even three times, making it so that you have to read ahead to figure out where you left off, and it's just plain hard to follow the story. An exercise in frustration; I'll be buying him a hard copy.Oh, and I disagree with a previous reviewer who said this was a vegan propaganda book. The real message behind the book is that eating only veggies is just as bad as eating only burgers, or any other food. At the very end of the story, the protagonist turns into a carrot, and is chased by a mean, hungry pink bunny :-)"
5,Hilarious book for your child (and yourself!),"Burger Boy is a hilarious story of a child who finds himself in a horrible situation, that his mother had been warning him about. Benny only eats cheeseburgers and eventually turns into one. The illustrations and story line are hilarious. Your child will laugh and you will laugh as well. To the person who said this book is ""vegan propaganda"". I think you are taking it a little bit too serious. Remember it is a childrens book, kids understand that books are not always real. When a child is read the childrens book, ""Pinkalicious"" where a girl eats only pink cupcakes until she turns pink, they don't really believe that next time they eat pink cupcakes the same thing is going to happen to them. It's all in fun, so relax."
4,still a good album,"While I agree that there are tracks here that should have been dumped in the trash, there are enough songs in this album to compensate for all the mishaps and whatever adjective you wish to fill in between to describe yours thoughts about its moderate artistic and commercial success.it is true that she sang IT NEVER HAS SEEN SNOW and THE SWEETEST SOUNDS to near perfection, but many have forgotten several songs that deserve equal attention and praise.For one, the song ONE NOTE SAMBA and GLAD TO BE UNHAPPY were sung wonderfully, and I am quite amaze that many have neglected to give mention to these gems. Barbra was in great form. Despite the silly improvisation on the first song mentioned above, Barbra did a superb version of these songs. She was, at first, comical and hautingly dramatic the next.Overall, the album provided some great listening, and that should be enough to buy this album."
4,Eric Kaz Craig Fuller,Great Music. Just got the CD last week and it brought back wonderful memories. Still looking for the --Eric Kaz Craig Fuller-- album/cd that came out around the same time. I have the album but it's beat up. It has some great tracks and has a superlative rendition of --Cry Like a Rainstorm-- and --Ways of a Woman--. Wish I could find this one.
1,Truly a horrible movie,"One of the worst movies I've seen. Dialogs are slow and every single performance is emotionless. I did not build any kind of sympathy towards Rip Torn's character or his wife. Yeah, you do get a sense that she's lonely, you do get a sense that he is a has-been still living the life of the rich and famous and you do see his somewhat distant son get it on with his mother-in-law. But might as well read it here as you'll feel no emotion whatsoever finding it out in the movie. The music is the only thing that spares it from being terrible.This movie is ranked right at the bottom of my list along with Van Sant's Last Days. People seem to overrate these pieces of film waste just because they're different. But my God, you can be different and good, entertaining and thought-provoking.DO NOT BUY OR RENT!"
1,Slow. Plotless.,"I suppose this movie could probably appeal only to a specific niche. If you see films as art and enjoy dissecting a movie into its separate components, you might like it; otherwise, if you appreciate movies as entertainment/a single piece of work that tells an interesting story, it could be torture.I met the main characters in the beginning and found the film predictable from then on. Apart from the lead, the characters generally have no depth and are just not engaging -- I didn't care for any of them. I felt bad for the leading lady once, maybe twice -- but I got over it quickly. The entire film drags on and on, as -- I found out too late -- there really isn't a story. (No ending, either. And, no, it's not one of those exciting cliff-hangers.) Still, I kept it on because I hate not finishing movies that I've begun watching. It was brutal. I had hoped it was a ""slow burn"" that would give some satisfaction in the end. But, no: It was an absolute waste of my time."
1,$30 for a USED copy!,"$30 for a USED version of this book?! I think not! This book only costs $20.00 at the campus book store. People sell USED books to try to get some of their money back, but you can't make a profit on used books!"
5,Saddle Up,"This is the kind of album for which you can easily round up a party posse or enjoy on your own. Intelligent and well-crafted, the music will work for the critical or casual listener.Never one to take himself or his material too seriously, Bromberg focuses his considerable skills on the service of his songs and their character, and his enjoyment is unrestrained and infectious.Today, Bromberg is the owner of a violin shop, and his live performances are sadly limited. But this album, while basically a studio recording, captures the breezy Bromberg style, relaxed and inviting. But don't get too comfortable, because when you're kicked back and least expect it, he really will take all your money."
5,great product,We love this stuff. Cleans hands with less dry skin effect. First time we have had a delivery problem from Amazon in 10 yrs but they corrected it quickly.
2,dont waste your money,"the Rectractable lights out vent shade does NOT retract very well nor does it keep the light out. the shade leaves a gap on the sides that lets light in. It works like a pull down window shade and since we have a thing called gravity here on earth, DUH. A piece of cardboard and a strip of velcro would work much better. On our last travel trailer, I velcro'd an old political sign (cut to size using scissors) and that worked just great. The product has to be screwed onto your existing vent so you will be stuck with extra holes once you throw it out, and you will very soon after installing it.I also bought the: Camco 45651 RV Insulated Dual Vent Cover, and it works very well. no extra screw hole required. Problem with it is that when you have the vent open, the wind vibrates the cover partially off. hope this review helps."
5,Great option for the price,"Installed this in less that 5 minutes. Put this in the bedroom to offer some shade from the ceiling vent. Does that and more. Noticed it seemed a little cooler also when the hot sun is out. We tend to leave it closed most of the time. It's a simple operation. Pull the blind shut, and put the loop on a screw to hold it closed. Then to close, pull and the spring retracts. Sure, the more expensive remote control ones look great, but for a few dollars, this does the trick nicely."
3,I purchased 2 and the screws in one package were wrong. There were 2 small screws a one larger screw need 2 large 1 small,There were 2 small screws a one larger screw need 2 large 1 small. I would like to have 1 more of the larege screw as the head has been painted to match.
5,Great Tool,"I bought this tool for my dad for father's day and he's a man who has maaaaaany tools, yet he still loved this tool and it works great for him. :)"
3,Who picked these songs?,"It's nice that they have Bad Brains, Minor Threat, 7 Seconds, Black Flag, but where are the Misfits, Dead Kennedys, Descendents? Hell,the Misfits had a whole chapter in the book, but can't get one song on the soundtrack? I recommend checking various Bit Torrent sites before dropping $$ on this thing."
3,"At times, beautiful; at times, pretentious","I heard great things about this novel and wanted to love, love, love the story.Moments in this novel are wonderful--the writing is lyrical and mezmerizing.However, I think Thon got lost in her words and fell in love with everything she wrote. There's a redundant feel to some of what she says again and again; a pretentiousness emerges in the writing, so that certain sentences and paragraphs felt over-done.The story reads like a draft--rambly in parts, beautiful in others--and would receive five stars with some good cutting."
4,The Cazalets,"Good movie, of course the book was much better. I wish I had seen it before Downton Abbey. The comparison is not as flattering. The Cazalets is not as artistic, but still a good story."
4,"Read the books, too","I enjoyed the TV series based on The Cazalet Chronicles, but I would advise reading the books, too. The script for the series modified the tone and seriousness of some aspects of the plot and diminished it in a disappointing way.The casting for the TV series was excellent, though, and it was well worth watching."
1,Nothing new here,Tis is a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy. I have four other supposed JB albums with the same music on it. Not worth buying if you have High Cumberland Jubilee. Not even worth one star.
3,it helped a little,It helped my foot pain just a little but it did make the skin softer on the bottom of my feet.Dr Singha's Mustard Bath - 32 oz - Powder
2,Not very suitable - returned the product,I think I followed the directions quite carefully. 3 times! The theory is great but the reality is that getting and keeping the guages properly aligned was very difficult. I purchase a different dial indicator guage that measures from the table to table to the knives and hit it right on the first time.
3,Listen to it Backwards,"No, I don't mean put it on a record player and spin it backwards - I mean start from the last song, number 11, then play number 10, etc., until you get to the first song.It sounds much better that way, and I'm convinced that's the way they wanted you to listen to it."
5,So much more than I expected,"I bought this because the trailer was funny, and I admit I wasn't expecting a lot from it.In the end though, this is an amazing movie. It has far more depth and passion than a movie of it's caliber should. And far more acting!The story of the Hobo with a shotgun is a story of brutality and violence just like the trailer showed, but the hobo is the good guy. It was an amazingly heartwarming and feel-good movie despite what goes on. I'm also impressed at the caliber of the acting, which really helped to hold it all together. Given the content, it would have been easy for bad acting to pull this movie down to a failure.I liked the details of the background, the little things that showed the set design crew had both dedication and a sense of humor.Buy it!"
1,I set the bar low - this movie didn't even meet that.,"I was not expecting much when I got this movie. I was hoping for at least some good action. It starts out promising, but never delivers."
1,Movie for Sickos,"Probably the single worst and most disturbing movie I ever saw. The gratuitous violence was WAY OVER THE TOP! The scene on board the school bus was disgusting. You need professional help if you enjoyed this piece of garbage.Also. after the Newtown slaughter in Connecticut,anybody who finds any redeeming value in this disgusting trash needs to reconsider what it means to be a loving member of the human race."
1,Terrible,"Sometimes a movie is so bad it's good... This is not one of those times. They tried... HARD... to be so bad that they would be good, and it shows. I wish I had spent my time on something else."
1,One word TERRIBLE............,"Horrible movie Rutger is good at times but overall this movie was terrible. I have watched worse however, I like Rutger Hauer ,so I guess you would have to make your own opinion and give it a look for yourself."
1,More blood than the Red Cross,I never knew what to expect as I will try about anything. This movie is gory and terribly funny at the same time. It is beyond ridiculous and can only imagine those who gave it good ratings were pre-teens. Save your time and pick anything else which is surely going to be better than this bloodfest.
3,Good genre film,"Pretty good movie. The acting is over-the-top like it's suposed to be. The violence is extreme, as it should be. It reminded me of the Troma films. I really enjoyed Rutger as the hobo. He is probably the most restrained of all the characters and that seems like the right way to play it. I'm glad I watched it, but I don't want to own it. For me, more nudity would have made the movie a beter example of the genre. The scene with the topless women hitting a guy with baseball bats and then Drake taking a swing was great. If the violence, story, lighting, etc are nonsensical then showing skin should be too."
3,ehhh,"Bloody, exactly as described. very much like the films its meant to be catagorized with. Have to be in the mood for this one"
5,amazing dialog,sweet one liners and decent quality special effects. This is an amazing b movie full of violence and cheesy dialog.
2,You've got to be kidding!,When I bought my Delphi Roady satellite XM radio it came with all this plus the set up things needed for the car for about $50. The radio conked out after less than a year and I stupidly tossed all the other stuff thinking I wouldn't use it again. Now they sell everything separately and charge more for it??? I think I'll stick with free radio.
3,Make sure your not an audio vox XM,I am sure this product is great but it did not say will not work with XM (Audio Vox)head units.
4,Good Product,This was a good product. I was able to easily plug it into my stereo system. Love the included remote.
5,Love it!,I don't know why I waited so long to get XM. This radio is just great. Easy to install in the car and then I take it inside to the Belkin boom box. I'm really pleased so far with this item. I've not had any problems at all.
3,Did the job,Bought this product as part of a Halloween costume and ended up winning first place in a contest because of how real they looked. My only issue with them is that they seem to start coming unraveled after only a couple uses. Be warned: Does not include the hat or beard depicted in the picture. It is strictly the Payis (curly sideburns).
4,Good player at a decent price,"I stumbled across this little gem while searching for an MP3 player with an FM tuner. It's priced great, has a huge storage capacity and I've found it's very durable. The only real complaint is that you can't create custom playlists, which is a pain when I load audiobooks onto the player. But it does have a good shuffle function, there's a customizable equalizer, and the FM tuner pulls in a good signal. I've had nothing but a good experience with the player, which is more than I can say for my $330 MYFI paperweight, but that's another review."
3,Very good,I got the player to listen to audio books with it. I cando it however it take a lot of time to get it onto the player.
5,First OP CD,"It still makes my heart sing that Camino finally got their break - with this cd featuring the theme to Koutetsu Sangokushi, the men of Camino really stepped up to say 'We're ready to take on the world!'Hayato has a brilliant voice - Kiku's fantastic guitar magic compliment him wonderfully. Taka's energetic bass playing make me want to learn, Rehit makes me feel every beat in my chest, and Ryosuke's haunting piano completes this amazing picture.If you have the chance to see them in person, DO SO. If not, enjoy their cds - it's a different feel from the live, but just as great."
2,Was Noisy then Burned out,"The blower motor was noisy to begin with... then the motor burnt out causing thick electrical smoke to fill up the car.Ill be going to get a replacement today, I really hope I got a manufacturing defect.Will try and remember to update this"
1,"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH","This book is AWFUL. Don't waste your time or money. The writer is horrible, he's all over the place, never keeping to the story, going off on adventures and subjects that have ZERO to do with the story AND is EXTREMELY BORING. I stopped reading 1/2 way through the book - maybe when I got nothing else to read on a rainy day I'll finish it, or should I say, skip through the remainder as I did thus far. Horrible, horrible writing - don't publish anymore books by this author!"
2,BORING!!!!,"I have a degree in Art History, and I still found this book horridly boring and, frankly, condescending in tone. Also the photos in the paperback version of the book are indistinct and lack explanation. Boo."
5,Red,"This book made me feel very guilty that I am not out there taking a stand on conservation, supporting a cause, or putting my land into a conservation easement. Her passion as well as commonsense about wild areas is contagious! She clearly defines the political and social situations surrounding land use through a variety of short stories ranging from disagreements within her family to lyrical myth. Even though Red is about the Southwest US, it is about land use everywhere. As with all Williams's books, the writing is marvelous.This should be required reading for everyone who deals with land use (yes, developers included), is passionate about conservation regardless of what part of the world they live in, and all who recognize the need for wild places to sooth our souls and give us some perspective on life."
5,Great Series,I took the book on vacation and enjoyed every minute of reading. I great Condition. Great experience
1,"immature, biased drivel","I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. If you MUST read it, either steal it or get it at the library. You won't feel as ripped off as I do. The author is virulently anti-Rand. I am open minded, but I refuse to be brow beaten by dullards. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Didn't contain what I was looking for.,"I was led to believe that this volume contained a poem I was looking for was in this volume, but it was not."
5,Donny Somewhere in Time,"Great CD, typical Donny romantic experience! The songs are popular ""oldies"", and it's nice to hear them in the smooth Osmond style."
3,has some worthy songs!,"I like tracks 1 - 4, 7, 8, and 10(but I really prefer 'Psychic Powerless,' 'Independent Worm Saloon,' and 'Electric Larryland' more)I usually just go for just listing the songs I like, rather than a general review of the whole album. That way people can see if they agree with me or not and then check my other reviews... (that's how I do it anyway -with other reviewers)"
1,The worlds worst movie.....by far,Illustrated by grade school kids and probably acted by convicts this is a real loser. Luckly I got it from netflix.TRASH
4,Battery for Sony D8 Camcorder,What a difference! The old battery was running out of power very quickly and when upgrading to this battery it was like night and day. Battery life of this new unit seems even better than the specs. It recharges quickly and holds the charge really long. Great product.
2,Just boring,"This is just a boring book, with no decent plot. The only reason to read it is if you own Lands of Intrigue and want to know the real story behind the ascension to the throne. If not, just run away from it."
2,Not as good as other gaffer tape,"Unlike other reviewers here, I found that this tape DOES leave a residue. I used it to hold cables firmly to a printer in my office. Removing the tape 2 weeks later, there is a sticky substance on the surface where the tape was attached. This tape is less like ""cloth"" than other gaffer tape I have purchased, it's more like a vinyl, and I wouldn't recommend it if you are concerned about being able to remove it later without residue. Maybe they changed suppliers since the other reviews were written."
2,You get what you pay for,"This tape was cheap. And Gaffer's tape is crazy expensive. But you get what you pay for. It's not wide enough, it doesn't have good grip, and it is always coming loose. We end up using 2-3 times more tape than we should, so the money we've saved is offset by overuse and poor quality tape.Go with the wider stuff if you can, and pick a different brand."
1,Not real gaffers tape,"I've worked as a photographer for a while, this is not real gaffers tape. This is not a cloth backed tape like gaffers tape is supposed to be. Closer to duct tape. I wish I'd kept the box so I could return this, it's not what I had wanted at all."
4,Don't believe all that you read,"Some of the negative reviews of this package are way too nitpicky. Garcia's playing shines on every cut and the band's ability to follow their leader shows that they were having fun. OK, maybe Donna's singing can get a little out of hand, but that is minor to say the least. The reviewer wanting more latter JGB need only to refer to the official releases out there. Now, an acoustic Garcia show would be a great release, I saw him in the early eighties, just Garcia and Kahn, but those were dark days for both men so don't hold your breath. Back to the cd at hand, you will do yourself only multiple favors if you pick up this release!"
5,One of My All Time Favorites,"If I could own only one JGB CD, this would be it. Marvelously tight performances by all involved, beautiful jamming -- a masterpiece."
5,we live for this,"it is impossible to not feel good while listening to this cd. this is what it is all about. you can get lost in every song, but you know jerry will bring you back.... less structured and more aimless than in later years, who wants structure??? recommended for jgb fans and as an introduction to anyone who wonders what the fuss was all about. is it perfect? no. thats why we keep coming back."
3,Average,"This is an average commentary of Romans. It's not as exegetical, linguistic, and precise as I would like. I agree with a previous comment that it is a bit too short for a book of such theological magnitude like Romans. It gives you some of the primary elements to the flow of thought by the Apostle Paul, but leaves much to be desired for the pastor/teacher/professor. I'm not recommending against it. If you are just looking for a basic commentary for Romans, it might be suitable. If you are looking for a devotional style, go with John Stott or John MacArthur. If you're looking for pastoral use, check out Moo or Schreiner, and if you want a boatload of Historic and background information as well as a magnitude of linguistics, you might want to check out Jewett."
1,More worse so what's wrong with this picture?,I've heard so many instrumental music of Billy Joel by a different aritist but I would'nt bother with this one right here. I know it's him performing without his talented vocal chords not included. Just as even more bad you won't have to buy it and listen for yourself. Because it's karakoe played on the CD. My advice is stick to Joel's original recording material songs from his Sony & Columbia albums label at lease there much better I think through an a opinion myself that would be for sure!
5,A Chorus Line sheet music,"A Chorus Line Sheet music is great to have if your like me and love the show, and love to sing. I love all the music in the show and it's fun to sing out of. And if you don't like to sing but like to play an instrument, get this music! You won't be upset you did!"
4,good tire,"I use this tire on my dual suspension bike at Kandahar. It works great in the deep dust, gravel and pavement. After 200 miles the tread still looks new."
5,One Amazing Album!,This was my first Barbra album and i was hooked for life!!!!!!! Its sounds as great now as it did back than!!!!!!
2,Sturdy but small,"I would agree that the product is well built, fabric and seams are durable, however for two people it is very uncomfortable. If snugglging up by a camp fire is what you want, look elsewhere. If leaning to one side, for example if the other person is leaning on you, the poles dig into your back, making it only possible to stay in that position for a short period of time. Mine still hurts from last weekend.There are flaps to protect the cup holders... not sure why these are necessary? Keep rain out when not using maybe?"
2,Love Seat Deluxe,The product itself is fine although it was smaller than I thought. Very short back and not as comfortable as the original deluxe models that were sold. This was one of the few websites in the USA that even sold this type of chair however. The first delivery that came was the wrong chair so I had to deny service. It took a long time to get this product.
5,It's SUPERIFFIC!,"Bartman, The Best of the Best is the Simpsons tailor-made for the superhero fan! Hilarious for fans of American comic books!"
5,have fun...annoy the neighbors,"great great great record...tight, hard, abrasive, one of albini's best....turn it up to 10 and just let it pummel you, plus its bound to shake the pictures off your neighbors walls which is always fun"
5,The best programming book that I have never read,"I have read this book about SQL2000 and VB.NET. (Spanish Version)I don't have words to say the wonderful that it's this book.It' s the best programming book that I have never read.Thank you to write it.I wait a new version soon.Best regards from Canary Island, Spain."
3,"Useful, but still lacking","I bought this book mainly hoping I could find good illustrations of a diverse selection of people. I find that most of those illustrations are too cartoonish for editorial use, and don't show much variety. The high resolution photos were of no use either as they are actually only ""medium"" resolution. They would be great for web usage but not for print. Also, I wasn't able to use the electronic image catalog and was unable to search the photographs effectively since the file names are not descriptive.If you're looking for illustrations of things rather than people, then this is a good source. The vector images are well organized and the print catalog is easy to use. Overall, I'd say this is a good product, but I don't think it offers much more than the 525,000 or 600,000 image versions."
3,Ton of clip-art.... good quality (great for the price),"You really can't beat the price on this set of clip-art. Many of the graphics are low quality vector illustrations which I wouldn't use... but the portion that is usable is well worth the price. The photos included are mostly useless for a serious graphic designer like myself. Most are 72dpi and many are poorly taken photographs. All of the business and people photos are outdated by about 10 - 15 years going by the clothing and equipment. The photos are not searchable by key word... you have to browse (which is very time consuming). Don't get me wrong - if you're looking for one set of clip-art that has just about everything, this is it."
1,Buyer Beware,"In a collection of 48 CD-ROMs I might expect that one of the 48 might be bad. Maybe. I would *hope* they would all function, but if one was bad I wouldn't be too surprised. But my first experience with this set was that the first 10 I chose (at random) would not mount. Wouldn't mount on my old G3. Wouldn't mount on my G4 Titanium. Wouldn't mount on my G4 Mirror Drive. Tried some more...some would mount and some wouldn't. Called the company to complain...they sent a new batch...all 48. Did it help? No. Same problem. Just for the record, I don't have trouble with other CDs. Just these. With the batch I have now, I'd say at least half of the CDs do not mount properly. On days when I know I'm going to have to look through this collection for a piece of artwork, I dread it...it's such a hassle. Some good stuff there, but not worth much when you can't get at it."
2,Far from the best of its type,"Of the growing number of books about male sexual abuse, this one rates just mediocre. The author seems to believe that abused men all grow up to be abusive, especially toward women. He ignores female abusers and the special issues of gay men. I'd recommend one of the better books in this area, especially Gartner's Beyond Betrayal or Betrayed as Boys, but also Lew's Victims No Longer and Hunter's Abused Boys. Also, Moran's The Tricky Part is a great memoir"
3,sing along,My 2 and a half year old granddaughter was not impressed with this cd. even though she loves another of the Fisher Price little people cd. Just not quite as upbeat I guess
5,This book is the essential tool to promote human rights,"HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION FOR THE 21st CENTURY is the essential tool for every individual and organization charged with the promotion of human rights awareness and understanding. HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION NEWSLETTER, Centre for Global Education, College of Ripon and York St.John."
2,paintballs,"The balls came in four bags of 500, two of the bags had busted balls, that made all balls in those two bags bad, very dissappointed in how they shot."
3,"Well, Is not bad but I did not like it","First, I like boyshorts/hipsters than reveal a little more of you for a sexy look. Said that, I have to tell you that this boyshorts are not very sexy. Too full in the back, which is said in the vendors description but I led myself by the photography (is not like that really is FULL). But, it feels very comfortable for an everyday use. It depends what are you looking for."
5,Exellent Album Cover!,"I am a musician. I have the album. When I got it on CD, it SOUNDED better. Kansas IS a great progressive hard rock band. I still get the chillswhen ""Can I Tell You"" comes on. 30 years, and it still rocks!"
3,WE ARE KANSAS! KANSAS IS A BAND!,"I didn't get this disc until long after I began my love affair with this band, which has stretched from the point I first bought ""Leftoverture"" on LP in 1980 and shows no signs of abating.This album is a mixed bag. On one hand, you get pop-commercial type stuff that they never messed with again, especially their odd cover of JJ Cale's ""Bringing It Back"". It's weird to hear Kansas sing about smuggling weed back from Mexico!On the other hand, there are hints of future greatness to come. The wistful ""Lonely Wind"" and the grandiose ""Journey From Mariabronn"" and ""Death of Mother Nature Suite"" show what would come in the future from this most excellent of bands.Only three stars because it is such a mixed bag. However, every band has had a beginning. Some were great from the beginning and some, like Kansas, genuinely PROGRESSED over time (with a few bumps in the road now and then). Still worth having."
2,The three little pigs with a twist!,"Well I've now read several of the Linda Jones, fairy tale books and most have been very cute lite stories that are easy to read and are just perfect for a lazy afternoon.This book was not up to the standards of the others. I loved the front cover, yum yum! The story was bland. I found the heroine to be a brat. I didn't like her at all. She seemed to be very full of herself. The Hero wasn't very nice either but I liked the hero a bit more but he didn't come alive for me at all.I wish I could recommend this one but I just can't."
4,Apocalypse Then,"These stark and dark films are accounts of the land misuse which led to two of the nation's greatest environmental disasters. I found ""The Plow That Broke the Plains"" especially riveting. The black and white presentation further lends barrenness to these accounts and focuses the viewer more closely on the mechanized devastation. The films demonstrate to what extent the federal government involved itself in national environmental crises in the 1930's, an involvement which may not be possible to repeat today in spite of a much higher environmental awareness across the population. Conservationists, environmentalists, and political historians should enjoy and learn from these documentary films."
5,Heaven,"In the beginning, God created the heavens, the earth, and the overture to ""Gypsy."" This is still one of the greatest cast recordings in the whole Broadway pantheon. Sheer bliss."
5,The one and only,"Still my favorite MO album. The live 'Dream' is just matchless in the annals of fusion.Years back -- early 2000-ish -- there was talk from CBS/Columbia that the whole concert would be released on CD. Obviously we're still waiting....In the meantime, MO heads might be interested to know that there's a slew of MO concerts from this same era, recorded live, available (legally) for listening on the 'Wolfgang's Vault' site. I think some are even downloadable."
2,pathetic earphones,These earphones are made of very cheap quality.the sound is very bad.it gives a hussy noise while listening.They are to be actually sold in 99Cents stores.
4,Love it but had gotten a hole after 6 years,I had bought one previously after I graduated nursing school and it lasted over 6 years. It had gotten a hole in it and when I bought the same one I can hear so amazingly well. It must have been getting a hole in it for a little while
2,the product does not come into my hands.,the product does not come into my hands.I would like to know who received the product and what I do ...thadeumozella85@hotmail.com
5,Just as ordered,"Fast shiping, I didn't receive a confirmation from the seller so I called him and he sent me a tracking information. Very good service."
2,Doesn't support iPod Classic... loved the features though,The product was good.. played DVD's nicely and even enjoyed the fact that the screen is turnable so as to turn it into a tablet style player. The only draw back is that it does not support iPod classic which is the purpose I had for purchasing it. I returned it and bought an iLuv model that works with the iPod classic model. Time for Philips to make an upgrade!
1,No service after warranty :(,"I hope you don't need service after the warranty because there is non.If you need service during the warranty they give you a new one, once the warranty is over buy a new one. They have NO parts for their portable DVD players, not even the drive. No more Philips products for me."
5,More than expected,"OK.. it is a DVD player... it is also a iPod big 8.5 screen player... it even displays SD images! It rotates, flips over, and it has a remote! Well, it is more than OK... It's GREAT!"
4,IPOD portable dvd player,"Great deal for the money. Took this on our trip and it worked great. The screen is a nice size and I was able to play all my shows that I downloaded on my IPOD. Picture quality was also great on the IPOD and dvds.The only problem I had was that the battery did not last very long, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching Dvds along with IPOD downloads."
1,Buyer BEWARE!!! DO NOT BUY for newer I-Pods!!!!!,"This product DOES NOT work with the 6th generation I-Pods! NOWHERE on the box or in the documentation does Phillips make that clear, in fact the unit is stammped ""insert 60 and 80 GB I-Pod here"". We bought the new 80GB Classic and when we connect it to the player, we could not get the video to work on the DVD player. Initially when we called Phillips they said it would work, but after getting passed to a supervisor they admited that it ONLY works with the old 5th generation I-Pods, and they are aware that they do not state that ANYWERE on the packaging or documentaion, nor did they seem to care. Nice Christmas suprise for our daughter - THANKS Phyllips!"
2,Poor build quality,"While the iPod integration (if you have an older iPod) is really nice, the unit itself has a very grainy, low-resolution screen and the build quality is very poor. Ours is literally falling apart (at the swivel hinge) and started doing so pretty early on in its life. It's a shame, since we have an older Philips 7"" DVD player which not only looks better, it was made like a tank and it still good as new. This one, however, will need to be replaced soon. I would avoid this and all future Philips models, no matter how compelling the feature list is."
1,Does not play 80gb & 160gb iPods,"I can confirm what others have written about the DCP 850. I went to both Frys and Best Buy and tried my 80gb in their display models DCP 850. The sound came through so I knew the iPod was connecter, but no video. The clerk and I tried every option.. changing the video settings, etc. Music but no video.There is a DCP 855 model out on ebay. I wrote questions to every seller and one replied that it was Philips way of keeping track of interior parts. Maybe, one of those parts is a chip to make the 80 & 160gb units play video. I can't confirm that.John"
5,mush,Mush is an easy guide to training my dog. The book is set up to find the exact chapter you need without reading the whole book.
3,It's like London Hipster Pretend Mod Film!!!,"You know, this movie may not be great, but it does engage you for like ninety minutes and has a wacky story, as well as a wacky stylization. I really identified with Phillip, not being the cool guy in any situation I'm in. And of course the love interest is just amazing to watch and listen to.The acting is a little awkward at times, the ending is a bit rubbish, and half the time you're even wondering why Marie would even care about the blond one, but the charm of the movie is that it's a really cute independent film."
5,Bought and Paid For,Jan Phillips embarks on the journey of a lifetime & I felt as though I were along for the ride. An interesting cross section of characters. A wonderful read!
1,BIG BAD BABBLIN' BOB SPEAKS,Oh my God....the Beatles KARAOKE style....this release is only slightly less enjoyable than a poodle caught in a garbage disposal. Didn't we learn ANYTHING from Pearl Harbor? P.S. Where's my dog?
5,Better than the rest,"I've had this camera more than a few months now, and I must say it takes excellent photos. I shopped for a long time and had a hard time choosing between this camera, the N65 and the Cannon Rebel 2k. The camera will not let you take a bad picture. I've been starting to stray from the full auto mode, and find the controls to be the best around. If things get weird, one button restores full auto everything. Get the extra wireless flash (which is unfortunately proprietary) and you have a great setup. The size and weight are an added bonus. I love this camera. No, its not metal. Except the lense mount, where it matters (unlike Cannon). But the silver looks cool."
5,"Fast, Feature Packd, and Minolta Quality","I went from a Nikon D!00 back to film, and after looking into the new film cameras. You cannot beat the features of this camera for the money!!"
3,"It's ok, but leaves you needing more","I like the way the book and CD are designed. Very handy for a first pass at learning French. I was disappointed that many of the vocabulary words in the back did not have the phoenic spelling of the words, like in the phrase section of the guide.Well worth the price, but be sure to supplement with a more comprehensive guide"
1,I doubt it,I thought multilevel marketing might be for me wasn't. After doing it & reading about it...NOIt is labor intense with no hopes for real reward. Very tough business. It seems like pyramid schemes to me & that is of course all about the top & that is not me!!!Donated to my local library.
1,Piece of Junk,"Either it was broken in shipping or it was defective from the start. It never worked and considering it's supposed to be portable, it was obvious that it's not very rugged. Buyer Beware."
2,just ok,"I was looking for a vegetarian recipe book because I want to eat healty, so I was very surprised these recipes used a lot of 'canned' foods. Plus, it was difficult reading the recipes because of the Metric/Imperial/ & American measurements and the type is pretty small. On the plus side, with 1000 recipes I'm sure to find many new ideas."
1,Too family specific - not a good source of general DI info,"This book is great for a school-aged girl who has been conceived through DI, is being raised by a mom and a dad, with the dad being the best father in the world.I found this book to be lacking in general, nuts and bolts, child friendly information about DI. There is a little in there, but the majority of the book is devoted to discussing the relationships between the girl and her parents.As a children's book, it is very wordy and the illustrations leave much to be desired. It is clearly directed toward children who are at least 7 or older.As the single mother of a bright, question asking 3 year-old who was conceived through DI, I am beyond feeling dissappointed with this book. I actually feel it would do our family more harm than good. My guess is that most same-sex parents of children conceived through DI will share my opinion."
2,No depth,"I know this book is intended for review and brushing up on concepts and/or extra practice problems. But the actual material in the book was so broad it bordered on being incorrect at times. The conceptual sections were worthless. And the questions were extremely easy, not great for studying, if that's why you're looking... don't get it."
4,good item,the item was more spongey than expected but it fit perfectly and was shipped fast. it will be fine for a newborn who only sleeps on it for a couple months!
3,craddle mattress,This product is made with synthetic material and I would have preferred something organic. It has some thickness which is nice.
2,Disappointed,I received the wrong product first THEN after waiting an additional week I received my product which seemed wrinkle wrapped and the dvd's seem of low quality....
5,BAD ENDING --- NEW BEGINNING?!?!,"Everyone needs to just calm down!!!! Ok this season, I admit, has some flaws... ok they are MAJOR FLAWS! However, if you keep in mind that this whole season was still entertaining, it was just more of a WTF shock value entertainment. It completes the TV SERIES of this amazing show. But season six just reaks of a forshawdowing of a possible movie followup that answers all the questions that season 6 leaves open. Even if it wasn't like Sex and the City where it hits the big screen, it could still echo Prison Break and just go strait to DVD. Who knows, this may not happen and then we are truly just left with a shi--y ending but it completes one of the best series ever so I'll still recommend buying it. But I do seriously see them trying to make a little more money by redoing this ending. Which is shady and totally hollywood but at least it does give us one more extended & hopefully enlightening episode to watch!"
5,Sorry it ended,"I think this was a wonderful series. I'm sad it's no longer on and didn't have more seasons. There was a great acting cast that made the show work so seamlessly. I've never seen straight actors portray lesbians so effectively. The chemistry between Bette and Tina was absolutely amazing. The sex scenes were totally believable. The emotion that Jennifer Beals and Laurel Holloman were able to evoke speaks volumes about their acting abilities. The other actors were very talented as well but I guess because Bette and Tina were my favorites I'm partial. I hope Ilene Chaiken, the creator, will pursue another series along the same lines. It was awsome that Showtime backed the project and I have a new admiration for their boldness and the chance they took. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed the show. And my personal opinion is that Jenny killed herself because she realized how much she had alienated herself, especially if Shane had confronted her, which we never saw."
2,Disappointing!,"My girlfriend and I were both disappointed with this final season. First off, the season only consisted of 8 episodes, so if you're smart you'll buy it cheap because it is not worth the $45 they're charging at Target or Best Buy! This is what began my experience with season 6...I open the box and realize that they only shot half the number of episodes than what a normal season contains.The second aspect of season 6 that was disappointing is that the entire season revolved around Jenny. I think the consesus is out, Jenny is nothing but frustrating...so I don't know why the entire final season revolves around Jenny.All in all, this final season is a disappointing, unresolved mystery about who killed Jenny. I don't recommend it, but if you're into the series until the end like we were, then my one line of advice is find somewhere that sells it cheap!"
4,lword,The final season had alot of unanswered questions and could continue for more seasons. I am bothered that some many questions were left unanswered. But if your a fan its ok.
1,overrated,"I gave it a shot...only the LGBT community really appreciates the ""issues & challenges"" in this series, so ...no universal, long term appeal. This is just another niche series for a niche audience. Years from now, it will be forgotten."
5,Amazed,"This is the first time that I've ever written a review after listening to an album only once. But this album is special. ""Spiderland"" is amazing. Dark, emotional vocals. Well paced songs that rumble then explode. Great lyrics. Sheer musical power. Everything.""Good Morning, Captain"" blew me away. ""I'm trying to find my way home. I'm sorry. I miss you."" The lyrics may not seem like much written out, but sung they are truly affecting. Buy this album. Borrow this album. Get these songs, one way or another."
5,influenced everything.,"All that can be said about this album is that it influenced so many people. It is kind of the ""Trout Mask Replica"" of the 90's everybody drops it but how many people really listened to it. I like to us the old saying about Velvet Underground, not many people bought the album when it came out, but everyone that did started a band. It's true, without this album by Slint, emo band maybe would not have taken the direction they did. There have been so many off chutes to this band (For Carnations, Rodan, June of 44), but none of them have reached the closeness to perfection that Slint reached on Spiderland. Hell Slint didn't even reach those dizy heights again. If you listen to ""Good Morning Captain"" and not feel the power in the song and almost cry in the end then you are not of the human species."
3,Sounds Familiar....,"Slint was recommended to me by Amazon because of my love for early 90's, late 80's indie rock bands like Dinosaur JR and the Pixies. My first reference I had to think of was Tortoise. That wasn't weird because when I did some more research I found that one of the members of Slint later joined/formed Tortoise.They only recorded two full length albums of which this is the last one. It has just 7 songs but they last at least 7 minutes.What makes this album good? Tempo changes, volume changes, key changes. Musically it is very interesting to listen to, though it might take a few turns in the CD player.I won't listen to it that often because it is difficult but it still sounds very good for an album that is more than a decade old now."
1,I don't know...maybe I just don't get it...,"Repetitive...boring...artless...Being a Louisvillian, I start out *wanting* to like a Lousiville band. When I've heard this many good things about a band, I want to love them. But it just didn't fall into place. Each riff is painfully heavy and dull. There is nothing that stands out to me as anything striking or even moderately interesting here. Maybe I'm a lone anomaly...maybe I just don't ""get it."" Bottom line, I wish I had my money and time back. But who knows, maybe it will grow on me..."
4,"Good ""live"" cd!","The long version of On Broadway was worth purchasing alone! Overall an good live cd. I generally don't like ""live"" music on cd but this is an exception!"
2,Packaged for damage,"Metal fenders shipped in a soft paper envelope? In spite of shipping charges three times the cost of the product, the fenders were practically guaranteed to be damaged in shipping. A great product at (too) low cost, simply destroyed on the way to the customer. I'd never buy anything again from this company!"
2,Good Picture but BAD Design,"I've tried several notebook webcams and was excited to get the logitech Quickcam Pro because of the good reviews, but I must say I'm very disappointed with the webcam and will be returning it for the Creative Ultra Webcam for Notebooks.The main problem is the design to attach it to your notebook screen. The hinge is so weak that the webcam just flops over and is always pointed at the ceiling or above your head. On the box they show the webcam securely fitted to the screen and it never sat that securely on my HP DV1000 or Dell D600 screens.On the plus side, I liked the image quality and the built-in microphone. But, those highlights are negated by the fact that its very difficult (if not impossible) to even get the camera pointed in the right direction!My suggestion is to try to find a notebook webcam that fits securely on to your screen (e.g. Creative Ultra)."
5,Great Support - A Bit Big,"I bought this when I was pregnant with my twin boys, and I got a LARGE. I was a little taken aback when I first got it because it was HUGE, and I had to pull the straps on the side very far and tight to make it give me support. So, beware that the sizes are pretty big, even for a twin pregnancy. But other than that, it gave me EXCELLENT support. Helped relieve my hip and groin aches, and was COMFORTABLE. It has enough padding to give comfort."
2,Uncomfortable,"I am 35 weeks pregnant and thought this belt would help with my back and hips. I am a small framed person, but I tend to have big babies... so I carry large and low. Perhaps it's the way I carry that makes this belt so uncomfortable. I find the design doesn't fit me well. It bunches up under my belly and there is no way you could sit in it for anything longer than a few minutes. The velcro parts seems to overlap off the fabric and scratch my skin.I regret buying this product. It might be fine for women who are built different or carry higher, but it doesn't ""do it"" for me."
1,Try other Goosebumps. Not this one.,"Until chapter 3, the book was OK. Then it gets corny ! Extreamly fake part of King Jellyjam !"
1,Useless and does not work,"I purchased this for my mom who has 2 cats, it cost me 4$ for the bottle and 8 to ship which i thought was a rip off, and secondly it didnt even help the cats. they dont like it, and it was just a waste of money."
2,Not the best buy,"The real flaw with this edition is the ridiculously small size that attempts to encompass a large symphony orchestra, solo quartet and choir. The result is almost complete illegibility. The notes tend to run into each other most of the time, and you would need a magnifying glass to properly study the score. My personal advice is to go for the full size version, despite the additional expense. At least, you can get to READ the notes in the score!! (The two stars are for the admirable translation of the Schiller poem ""Ode to Joy"" and explanation of the evolution of the recitative preceeding it in the introduction)"
5,The Sine Qua Non of Flight Simulation,"What else can be said about this HOTAS system? Highly, yet simply programmable, it will let you do things you could not imagine in days gone past. Well-built, heavy and impressive in its looks, it will elicit strange stares of amazement from those who thought flight simulation was a simpleton's endeavor. The spring tension on the stick is a bit tight but really not unbearable. Some people hate the tension but I think it adds to the immersion, especially when flying a WWII prop sim. The throttle has smooth action with a slight detente at the point where you push it into afterburner range. There is a very active and passionate community of owners on Cougar World. Check it out!"
2,Ok but not very modern book,Book was not well written nor was it well thought out. It was difficult to access specific information (such as hotels and restaurants). The author also recommended the Hard Rock Cafe--which made me wary of any other recommendation he had! I'd recommend the Frommers Guide to Mexico for a better picture of Puerto Vallarta and Discover Puerto Vallarta for the pictures and additional information.
4,NOT KARAOKE! This is an Elton compilation!,"NOT KARAOKE!!!!TERRIFIC ELTON COMPILATION WHICHMIXES A FEW HITS WITH FAN FAVORITES!SIDE ONE1. YOUR SONG (from ""Elton John"")2.

3,Inconsistent size,"This was my second Bobby Shew Lead mouthpiece, I loved the first one so much, that I had to buy another for a student of mine. Upon arrival, I tested the mouthpiece to ensure it was of the same quality as my first. In all actuality it was a slightly larger size than my first one. The cup was deeper and rim was slightly larger. I was definitely disappointed with the differences."
4,Great Camcorder,"This camcorder is great for the normal person. It was not made for the sim-pro or pro vedio maker. This is a very good camcorder for the price. It is easy to work, has great Zoom and the OIS is great. I have used this camcorder every where. Please stay away from the PV-GS80, for a few dollars more you can get the PV-GS85 that does a lot more and I had the 80 and had problems with it the 85 is so much better."
4,"Easy to use, good price",Nice camera for a good price. Easy to use. I think it shoots well in dim light. Just using to capture the kids. The only downside is you cannot charge the battery while using the camera.
5,Princess,This was my first Vera Wang fragrance purchase. I was hooked after smelling the magazine sample earlier last year.
3,Sweet,"Love it, its light has a vanilla scent, it's not a winter perfume its a summer perfume. I am giving this scent 3 stars because it does not last long on me, but its worth the try"
5,Great Perfume,"I first found out about this perfume from one of my daughter's friends who was joking about being able to use the pointy cap in case you ran out of pepper spray :P and I discovered the smell was pretty darn good. I love to find the small things that help keep aging at bay and having a sweeter, youthful sort of scent like this really helps out. These are my favorites for the rest of the aging battle:Lancome Absolue Replenishing Cream SPF 15Clinique Clarifying Lotion 3Relastin, Eye Silk, 0.5 oz, 15 mlSkinCeuticals Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30 3ozRoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum 1ozI can't turn back the clock, but I'm not going down without a fight either!"
3,Great but not what I expected,"Its a very light windbreaker, i expected something with some kind of insulation but i still kept it since it does come in handy and it was a great price. Just keep it mind it has no insulation at all and if thats what you want its perfect for you."
4,Decent for what it is,"An inexpensive, non-breathing, light raincoat. I keep mine in my car for light or unexpected rain. Works well. Nicely sized (2xl) for me. Buy it on sale and be happy with the deal. Probably much less so at retail price."
1,Not as described!,"Be careful, the picture shows 3 pieces. A know end, what looks to be an adapter for different size threads and a piece that holds patches. What I received was only the know end. Buyer beware."
4,'WHITE PRAYER' by alice nine. - [Single],"I have to say straight-off that I do not understand Japanese. I simply am the type of person who can embrace the best qualities of any music and discard the poor choices of any music.That said, I enjoyed the 'WHITE PRAYER' single. The title track is very good, and as is the case with many good artists, the b-side tracks would be great on the album of the title track. 'THE LAST EMPIRE' is among my favorite alice nine. songs, because it has a sophisticated yet unhindered energy that many artists these days attempt to capture, but miserably fail in doing so.'''''''''''''''''' [English: 'Stray Cat'] has a more light, pop-music feel to it, but isn't cheesy. It's just a light, enjoyable alice nine. track.So, while this is not the best single from alice nine., it has very enjoyable music on it, including one of their best songs."
1,Please someone take away his typewriter,"Boy, his first series was kind of fun. Nice, juvenile fantasy, nothing special. His second series wasn't THAT bad. Move the characters around a bit. His third series wasn't very good. The same characters as the first two series, just with different names. His fourth series is the characters from the third series in completely predictable situations. It's pretty damn bad. The characters are never in any danger, spend all their time coyly batting their eyelashes at each other, and the dialogue is unbelievably bad. You end up vigorously rooting for the bad guys, but it's no good because they never had a chance."
5,Getting Excited About Data,This is an especially useful book for leaders of school improvement teams in elementary and secondary schools. Holcomb presents techniques for using student achievement data to generate enthusiasm for school improvement. Data analysis for monitoring the success of the school improvement plan is also a featured area within the book. Many practical techniques to use data analysis with school and community groups are provided. The presentation of this material alleviates some fears felt by people who seem apprehensive about data analysis. The style is informal with many personal anecdotes that ease the way into a discussion of data management.
1,Prevents snoring by preventing sleep.,"Extremely uncomfortable pillow. My neck still hurts from last night. Luckily I purchased it from Bed Bath Beyond and received a full refund. I don't know if it actually prevents snoring, but it does prevent sleeping."
1,The Thief,I did not like this book because I thought it was boring. The first half of the book is them just walking. Then the middle is pretty cool but then they just walk back.
3,Very Okay,"If it was not the case that the weight of this book was at the very end, I would have given the book four stars, instead of only three. The author focuses too much on the eating and sleeping habits of the main character throughout the book, sacrificing the quality of dialogue and character development. The only reason I continued reading the book was my hope that there was more to this whiny main character...that paid off."
3,"I wanted to love this book, but...","I make it my business to read all the Newbery books since I teach middle school language arts. I really wanted to love this book. I was excited to read it. In my opinion, however, it failed to be a book worthy of the Newbery. The characters were not fully developed and often became secondary to loquacious descriptions of the setting that I found monotonous and adding little to the plot. I was starving for more dialogue and the pace slowed so drastically in the middle that I had to drag myself to the climax.Whalen is a talented author and this book had the potential to be a gem, but fell short. Again, just my opinion - I realize I am in the minority here. I am still going to read the sequels in hopes that Whalen made adjustments in style that are in sync with her clever plots."
2,The Thief,"The Thief was a fairly decent book. At the time your reading it it dosent seem that exciting but, you always want to find out what will happen next. The writing in it is very long-winded and there was a lot of filler. It made it seem like the Author was just trying to stretch out the story to make the book longer. The plot seemed to dissolve at times and stray away from the plot. There was also a twist at the end that didn't make much sense.The Thief is about a boy named Gen, who at the beginning of the story is in prison. Gen is a theif, apparently the best thif in the world, who's bragging has led to his capture. The story is set in ancient times, mabey somthing like ancient greece. Gen is taken out of prison by the ""Kings Magus"" whatever that means. He is taken out to go on a long journey to steal somthing for the king. He won't tell him where their going or what their stealing.This book is appropriate for 6th through 8th graders, but I personally would not reccomend it.PARTY!!!"
2,broken spine--was labeled as good,Fantastic story line. But the condition of the book was not what I expected. I have not finished reading it yet and have already had to tape the pages to keep them from falling out.
2,Fell Flat,"I can't really decide between 2 or 3 stars. The beginning of the book was painfully boring, but the second half was much more interesting. This book had the potential to be 5-star, but the writing was flat and lacked any kind of emotion. It read like a history textbook that stated fact after fact after fact instead of inducing feelings of excitement and intrigue in this action packed adventure. Regardless, I'll read the next book in the series since it appears to be much better than the initial installment. *crosses fingers*"
4,A Thief is Forced on a Mission to Steal an Artifact Sought by Three Kingdoms,"Gen is stuck in the King's prison after accepting a bet that he could steal anything, to prove he is a master thief. He stole the King's Seal, but unfortunately, it didn't end well for him. After months of languishing in his cell he's taken out by the King's advisor, the Magus, who needs him for a secret mission to steal an artifact of the Gods that people believe will legitimize the kingship over a rival land. They are accompanied by two other boys--the Magus' apprentice and a young noble--and a soldier. But the whole plan depends on Gen's abilities as a Master Thief.It is set in a land that is similar to ancient Greece, only with more advanced technology (guns and watches--as well as the more usual swords). There are dreams of Gods and secret chambers and political intrigue and betrayals and twists that make this adventure enjoyable. I am definitely looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
4,nice product,Nice product. One complaint ... the hinges are so small/tiny that the cover falls off. Now the dumb thing won't even turn on!!! Not such a nice product anymore.
4,An excellent introduction to Cisco configuration.,"Chris Lewis does an excellent job of bringing a new Cisco administrator up to speed on many of the basics of router configuration and operation. Although not the most in-depth of references, it covers most subjects rather well and can also help prepare those wishing to get their CCNA or possibly CCNP certifications. It won't put you to sleep like many of the Cisco Press books and it sure beats trying to get the same amount of information off of Cisco's web site. If I changed anything about this book it would be the title since it is somewhat misleading as a true ""reference."""
2,Outdated map,"I bought this map so that I could follow a friend's sojourn in Azerbaijan. The map, it turns out, is antiquated and not that userfriendly. Even Azeri's found this map confusing!"
5,"Awesome show, but why is a HD show not released on Blu-Ray???","The show is broadcast in Hi Def and yet it will only be released in lesser quality DVD ?? Boo. Excellent show, but I'll be saving my episodes on my DVR and not purchasing anything until it's released on Blu-Ray, and that is also when i'll give it the 5 stars it deserves.UPDATE 9/20 - found this IS available in Blu-Ray format at another US Retailer. Updating to 5 stars. Awesome show."
5,fantastic series,"Great update of the original series. The cast is perfect, particularly Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan. Excellent stories, killer action, a throughly enjoyable show."
1,Customer Service?,"I purchased a brand new, factory sealed set of dvds. Several of the discs are very pixelated and distort viewing. I have been contacting the company for a week now and cannot get emails returned or speak to an actual person!"
5,the new hawaii 5-0,hi my name is charlene and i just loved the new 5-0 what great and alex o'loughlin played his part well i love that show it has me bye my seat and all the work that went in to it was out of the worldi never saw anything like this any where this show has it all i will watch itcharlene
5,Great Reboot,Grew up in Hawai'i and remember the original Hawaii 5-0. This is an excellent reboot for the modern era. And Grace Park is hot too.
4,Fun and Hot,"I'm too young to have seen the original, but Hawaii Five-O is one hot remake. Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan are great as the odd couple: the Hawaiian seal and the former NJ cop have great chemistry and their interactions are often laugh-out-loud funny. And Grace Park kicks ass. On the gorgeous Hawaii, this special task force sets to solve cases that are interesting and unpredictable, and the result is one great ride."
5,Great book but no references,"Having read some technical papers by Livingston, I checked out this book by her at a library. I was so impressed, I decided to buy my own copy. I've since loaned it out several times and reread it several times. I have a strong science background but no art background and found the book very easy to read and enlightening. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to understand how two dimensional paintings ""work"". My only problem with the book was the lack of references."
3,Mattress an inch shorter than advertised,"We purchased this mattress to fit in our 15X33 cradle. The mattress arrived quickly but without any sanitary plastic wrapping. The mattress was an inch shorter than the advertised dimensions. The return process was not very difficult. We were asked to email aBaby and request permission to return the item, which they gave within a few days. After that we were asked to provide a tracking number before our refund could be processed. We found a 15X33 mattress easily from a local vendor that fit perfectly."
5,Great for baby,"This was the only mattress that I could find that would fit in my bassinet. It's thick, soft, and firm all at the same time. It's easy to clean and easy to find sheets that fit it."
1,Broken within 6 months,"Not only did this Air Purifier break but the company, PWL, has refused to replace it or refund my money. Do not buy it!"
1,"very trite, uninteresting, no knowledge to be gained","Beware. This is not a book, but a mere phamlet that talks about nothing more than common sence concerning basic manners. It is very short, and contains writing on only one side of the page. One would be better off reading a basic primer on social behavior at a dinner party.There was nothing interesting to be learned, and it was very boring. You could finish reading it in 15 minutes. It certainly was not worth the Price. I returned my copy for a refund.What would have made the phamlet interesting would have been to talk about couples first encounters at a couples club or house party, and to discuss the various emotions and interplay between couples. There should have been examples of discussions between couples of what to expect from the swinging life style, and to relate some of their actual experiences both good and bad.In summary - forget about it."
1,Poor Advice In A Small Package,This booklet gives a shallow and distorted view of the swinging lifestyle that lacks any sense of camaraderie or feeling of warmth. Too many silly rules; too little insight.
4,A really good fast paced story,"This story is a sequel to 'The Bride of Windermere.' If you haven't read the first, this story will lose some of its appeal. The heo is Hugh Dryden, a knight who was held prisoner for two years and feels unworthy of being alive because of his inprisonment and disfigurements from repeated torture. He must select a wife however. He come's highly recommended to Lady Marguerite, a wealthy, beautiful and proper woman. Instead he falls in love with Lady Sian, a Tudor of royal though low birth who is full of life and on her way to a nunnery ( where she doesn't want to go). She loves Hugh almost at first site, though it takes Hugh a little longer to realize that he loves her and they deserve each other. Though this is not a novel that will take very long to read and is not very detailed, you should enjoy it."
4,Borboletta,"I first heard this album when it first came out when I was a young teenager, I am now 43 and certain tracks on this album are truly wonderful.Practice What You Preach is a haunting track, a very slow methodical start, with crisp clear tones from Santana's Gibson is spinr tingling, then the percussion, bass and vocals converge to complete a magnificant track.If this track was bought out by a ""commercial artiste"" in 2004 it would be hailed as a masterpiece."
5,Transitional,"""Borboletta"" is yet another in a series of musical transitionstaken by Carlos Santana and his band over the years,in this case a transition from heavy latin fusion to R&B and funk.""Cantos de les Flores"" gets the ball rolling with a very traditional Santana-style percussive afro-latin jam (coulda' come off the bands first album really) but this album doesn't stay there for long.""Life Is Anew"",""Give And Take"" and ""Practice What You Preach"" toughen up the grooves with a funkier backbeat and strong songwriting and lyricism as Santana leave behind their jam-oriented 60's era roots in favor of a more concise sense of songcraft.This apporch streches across the bulk of the album that only returns to the bands latin rock roots on the closing title song.As a release ""Borboletta"" stands between 1973's ""Welcome"" and 1976's highly funky ""Amigo's"".And the exact same can be said said musically.So fans of those two albums will beat home here."
4,A great cd,"Meatloaf's live CD is a great one. If you like both his old stuff and new stuff, you'll really like this. For example, old: Paradise by the Dashboard Light is awesome on this CD. For example, new: Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire is a great, energetic song, and it's one of my favorites. Not only are the songs on these CDs good, most of them are much better than the original studio versions. One drawback is the speech at the beginning of one of the CDs. It's really a waste of time. Other than that, it's a very good CD, and you should get this."
4,Helpful,"Finally, something I could tangibly use for help in managing emotions and out of control thoughts. It's good at explaining why we allow feelings to get overwhelming and how to make that into a process where we think differently. My only negative comment is that it refers to completed worksheets and you have to keep flipping back and forth in the pages to look at the worksheets and read their explanations. It would be helpful if it was all on the same page and in order. Otherwise I think it's been a good tool, added to other things, to use to get a handle on the out of control thinking."
4,Answers many questions.,"Though relatively brief (compared to other books on communism), this volume is more detailed than most.The focus of this book is on the Warsaw Pact nations: Hungary, East Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. Albania is not really included, but there is a chapter on Yugoslavia. Internally, the USSR is not really discussed, although, of course, it often enters into the picture tangentally. The Ukraine is also not really discussed.Often some puzzling intellectual element, such as the terms hyperrationalist or antirationalist, or quotations from politician-intellectuals will undoubtably stop most readers and make them scratch their heads, if they are like me. But despite this, there are a lot of interesting facts which make this volume compelling. Topics range from discussions of the political leadersship of each country to Solidarity and analogous movements to the economic problems facing each country, both of communism and of the westernization process."
1,Gideon Fell fans stay away,"This books mindless ""mystery"" and painful attempts at farce seem pathetic compared to Carr's other smart Gideon Fell mysteries. The characters are as flat and wooden as they are thinly developed and the plot is as forgetable as any movie of the week. I also believe that the true crime is putting Gideon Fell in maybe 5% of a Gideon Fell mystery. Unforgivable. This story seems like it was to never actually meant to be a Fell mystery and his character was tacked on when perhaps it was thought that this book would not pass muster on its own. ( it doesn't) Enter at your own risk. Better yet read The Mystery of the Green Capsule or the Three Coffins instead for a couple of great Gideon Fell mysteries."
2,Both CD's were flawed,"The music is fine, but both CD's get stuck at a certain point while playing, and they're brand new! I will try cleaning them but it shouldn't be necessary with CD's that just came out of the box."
4,A must for hard core punks!,"This compilation album is a combination of ""We're the Meatmen and you Suck"" , and 2 EPs, along with some demo material. Definately for hard core punk fans !"
2,Sounds Like You,"I saw these guys live long ago here in DC, and they scorched. You probably shouldn't get your hopes up about the CD, though. It was funny the first time I heard it, but I can't listen to it for pleasure. It's a CD you could make, if you and your friends got really drunk one night, found a buncha rusty musical equipment lying around in someone's uncle's attic, and started goofin. And I love Minor Threat and even Fear."
4,A most interesting and well written story,"I really liked this book. Mr. Grant does a good job of telling a story. The characters are believable and well developed. In an age when many people don't seem to be finding what they need spiritually in the organized church, Reawakening gives the reader a chance to identify why. I could envision each character in the book and relate to the main character's spiritual reawakening. The information about early Christianity and Church history were especially interesting to me. Through this book Mr. Grant has successfully portayed the modern churches' dilemma and the challenges it faces if it is to remain relevant to people's spiriual needs I felt after reading this book that I would like to read more of Mr. Grant's work."
4,Application Engineer,"This was a gift for my step son who is an avid Yankees fan.The rest of us are Red Sox fans, so that presents quite an atmosphere in our household.We redid Joshua's bedroom, walls, furniture, curtains, bedsheets, pictures, wall hangings and yes...the wastebasket to reflect a Yankees baseball theme.It worked perfectly!!Thanks again for this item!!Tom"
1,Died after 8 Months,"Had a reasonably good sound for the price (I found it on clearance at Target) so I decided to buy it, despite having read the numerous negative reviews on Amazon. As described in other reviews, the unit would crash randomly after a few months of owning it and eventually stopped powering on. Philips built the unit so the speakers would ONLY work with this receiver, so now I'm out a receiver, 5 speakers and a subwoofer. I've decided to spend an extra $150 on an Onkyo receiver and a Yahama speaker set rather than give more money to a company that produces complete junk. Extremely disappointed with Philips - never again!"
5,One of the best scores of Victor Young,"Scaramouche is for me one of the best and romantic filmscores of Victor Young.I've waited long to see it released but eventually there it was. And ScreenArchives Entertainment delivered it in no time, can recommend them to anyone."
5,Yamaha Clarinet Thumb Rest Cushion,"It was well made, and fit my clarinet with no problem. It easy on the thumb. I am happy with it. I used it on my Buffet E13, and it worked. It may be small, but on the long run I am thankfull I have one."
4,Possible star on the horizon.,"Shannon Brown has talent. With the right management and material, she will be around for years to come. She compares very favorably with Faith Hill and Mindy McCready. I can't wait for the album."
5,The most bang for the buck,"There seems to be several versions of this ""Followed The Waves"" single, and as a rule import singles offer the most bang for the buck. However, this is one of the rare exceptions when the less expensive domestic version offers the most. I'm mainly referring to the enhanced section of the ""Followed The Waves"" video, which is great. As far as I know this is not on the import singles.The b-side ""Good News"" is a very good song although it might take a few listens to fully appreciate. It's very mellow and low-key, but haunting and serene. It was a good move to not include this song on the album, as it would probably be a little out of place.So don't bother with the import versions of this single. This is the one to get. And check out the single of ""Real A Lie,"" another gem."
5,Breaking the Waves,"Auf Der Maur breaks off on her own with her solo debut in a hard and heavy way. Proving women can rock just as hard as anyone. Her first single 'Followed The Waves' will definately open some eyes, and some ears. The ex Hole/Smashing Pumpkins bassist shows her true talent as she leads the songs with her powerful voice. If this is any indication of what the rest of the CD will be like (which comes out May 15th) it will definately be in the top 5 CDs of the year!"
3,he or she?,"umm, C.J. Cherryh is a WOMAN. http://www.cherryh.com/www/menu.htmas to the book itself, i thought it was better than average but not as good as the Chanur novels or 'Downbelow Station'. an improvement on the previous foreigner books but she still mistakes dithering for decision making, a common failing in many of her novels."
1,Defective printing,"Love the story, but would like to know how it ends, current amazon inventory appears to be a defective print run missing the key climactic 30 pages or so. I returned 1 copy for replacement and both had the same problem. While i recommend this book, i would strongly recommend avoiding new paperback until amazon replaces current stock."
3,"Not Neil Simon's best, but a good little movie . . .","Pleasant entertainment, good performances by Marsha Mason and Valerie Harper. I sure wish it would come out on DVD. While you're at it, how about making the soundtrack available on CD? That final song by Marilyn McCoo has been in the can far too long! C'mon Rastar, Sony Pictures, anyone listening?"
1,"completely unusable product, sounds bad, poor workmanship ~ pathetic basically","The workmanship in this product is something you might see on an imitation of this product *costing 1/100th of the price*...unfortunately that's not the case. The sound quality is AM radio at best but during this low quality AM-ish sound you can also hear background 'Bluetooth' noise...a kind of whooshing sound (spread spectrum?). I used it with my ipod, my Nokia 9500 cell phone and my mac laptop and they all sounded the same through these headphones: horrible. The first day the headphone cushion fell off the right ear and will not stay on. Do not buy this product; you will be disappointed if you do."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME -- DON'T BUY IT,"This book stinks. An inelegant way of putting it, but it is so boring and so poorly written that even a hardcore ""foodie"" would lapse into a coma from reading it. Don't waste your money or your time!!!!"
4,Love It!,My wife & I love our DVD. Really impressed with the improved picture & sound quality. We have a big screen TV with surround sound. It is just like being at the movies! Glad we got the 2715 because of the 5 CD carousel. No problem with skipping as some of the other reviews mention. We would highly recommend the Toshiba 2715 to everyone.Larry & Carole
2,Eurkea 5841 Litespeed Vacuum,I have good results with this vaccum...when it is working properly. The belt breaks or comes off all the time and where the hose connects to the canister gets plugged up evertime I use it. If I still had my store receipt I would return it but I don't so I will have to make the best of it...for now.
2,Moriarty Shoots a KC Chief,"This movie was originally shot in Volker Park in Kansas City Missouri in 1972. It features Michael Moriarty, Paul Sorvino & Buck Buchanan (of the CHIEFS). I play one of the ""hippies"" harrassing Officer Moriarty at the beginning of the movie. If you're a fan of my work you'll enjoy my first big screen appearance. Otherwise, this is a mundane & tired script about a wrongly accused ""HIP"" cop."
1,This man is a hack!,"This is a piece of trash written by a leftist hack seeking to claim Burke for his own pathetic ideology. If one seeks to understand Burke, he would do well to read Russel Kirk's The Conservative Mind."
3,Take Out the Tracks,"The first half of the cd here really kicks.The added live songs sound""TERRIBLE"",very terrible.Thats why I gave this release three,instead of five stars. This is still cool cut h-core,with bites of angry vocals."
3,check out laughing hyenas,"ok, so this is not much of a review, but i'd say that if you really want to hear the full scope of john brannon's anger and nihilism a better listen is the laughing hyenas -- either ""you can't pray a lie"" or ""life of crime"". it's the grown-up, cinemascope version of what you're getting here."
2,Not so memorable,"... I have had this album for quite some time, and it has a lot of dust on it because it basically [stinks]. Asside from a few half-way good songs, it is bland and boring. It was the very last one to go on my mp3 player. If you like music from other genres besides punk and hardcore, you'll probably do fine skipping this one. If you ONLY listen to hardcore, then, well, I guess this one is ok. Either way, make a sound investment (no pun intended): If you want to expand your collection with lesser-known albums, try Dem Bones or Decapitated by Broken Bones, Jaybird by Token Entry, or anything by The Stupids."
5,The Best FRG ever!!!!,"This book is well thought out and play tested. It is creative and versitile, not restrictive like alot of the other FRGs. Very creative for all players. A must play."
5,You Must Be Kidding.,"If you've never listened to this you must. To get where this band was then, it is incumbent upon you to listen to this now. Allow your predetermined ideas of how a rock band should sound and operate to be pummelled by this truly great meeting of sound structuralists."
5,Trumpet Mute,The product was just what I was looking for. It meets my needs totally and has helped me to be able to practice my trumpet playing when I am traveling and in hotels.
5,first novel raises more than a few serious eyebrows,"I have yet to be disappointed in any book (fiction or non fiction) that Nick Delbanco has published. He is even, and he is magically so. (A rare combination) . In other words he's brilliantly 'correct' but he has poetry in his veins.He is also a great wit, scholar and a teacher who has the language to impart with just the right amount of suggestion what the student can 'hear'.he has been a long time teacher of classes thatI I have followed him to and highly suggest THIS book, as it is his first, and it has some of the same strokes that Styron in ""lie Down in Darkness"" startled us with."
5,Incredibly Good deal,"Paid about $2 for this cord, and it hasn't given me trouble yet. You really can't lose with this purchase."
1,Don't buy this HDMI cable!!!!!,"When I hooked up this HDMI cable to my blue ray player and then to my TV the cable doesn't even work. The HDMI cable is a lot thinner gauge wire then is shown in the picture on Amazon. I wish I never bought this HDMI cable, and I am stuck with 3 of them."
1,Doesnt work,"If you are going to buy an HDMI cable, spend at least $6 or you will get a cable that can't handle the data volume. This cable would not work with my PS3 and a DVD. I had to go out and buy one at Radio Shack ($40!!!) - I was on a tight timeline and couldn't wait for a new cable to be shipped - and it worked fine. You get what you pay for - except in my case I needed the cable overnight, so I got a defective cable and overnight shipping charge of $50."
4,seem fine,"i bought 2 of these. connected 1st cable to the DVD player, then to the tv. at first, no sound and no audio. wiggle cable, then some audio. maybe the first cable is bad. connected 2nd cable to DVD player then TV. got audio and a crazy odd picture - it was like everything was only in red, blue, and green. Turns out the DVD player connection for HDMI is ""broken."" tested the cables on my laptop (connected to TV) and all is fine. for the price, these cables are probably a good idea."
1,worked on and off for about 1-2weeks,"Signal was very weak from the day I recieved this item. Would flash off until I wiggled the cable. Eventually, the cable didn't work at all. I must have a recieved a faulty one, but my only option would be to send it back. This would end up costing more than I paid for the cable though, so I just threw it away and looked elsewhere. You buy cheap, you get cheap ****. Good Luck [:"
3,overall good deal,A great price for a decent cable. Delivery was slightly slower than anticipated and cable isn't as heavy duty as some but it works great and the price was excellent.
2,Not pleased.,"While it does hold CDs as advertised, don't expect it to do it's job without falling over and spilling your CDs everywhere. The back legs are made too long so that it becomes front heavy when loaded with CDs, so depending on the flooring you sit it on, it will fall over and spill everywhere, unless you lean it against a wall, or put a counter weight on it's back legs. It's a pretty bad design flaw."
5,A Diamond In The Rough,"This book is a typical first attempt, and yet so much more. There are formatting errors, yes. But what convinces me I spent my money wisely is the quality of the story. With strong, but believable characters, a variety of supporting characters and REAL locales, I'm very glad I bought this book! The characters have flaws, hobbies and secrets just like everyone else, they have pets that they care for and no matter what happens, the emotions are always real. Even Morrigan's anger toward her father when she finds out... I won't ruin it for you. Buy the book already!"
5,The definitive book on self-help,"I have been buying self-help/power of positive thinking books and tapes for as long as I can remember. They haven't all been complete wastes of time, I have picked up a few nuggets of wisdom here and there over the years, but I was never able to find that one resource that put everything together in a manner that was scientific enough for me to believe and plain enough for me to understand and use instantly to make major changes in my life. That was until my journey lead me to this book. It is the holy grail of self-improvement and the last book you'll need to buy searching for the ""magical secret"" to change your life.I won't go into detail on how this book has changed me but events happened since reading this book that frightened me as they took place. All positive stuff, don't worry, but unbelievable nevertheless.Look out world, here I come!"
5,Great easy to read and easier to apply,"Great. Easy to read. Easy to apply. If you're interested in these toes of subjects, this is a great start."
3,Disappointed,"Having read the reviews below I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. As one reviewer wrote that it was clearer than Joseph Murphy's classic, I couldn't wait. Well I was quite disappointed. If you have read the ""Masters"" on this subject, then this book will give you nothing new. I found the author covered too many topics in a very scanty way. I would have preferred if he covered fewer topics but in a little more depth.For me it really was a beginners introduction. If the whole area of the powers of the subconscious is new to you, then this is a good introduction. But for me, it came no where near the classics. If you really want to understand the power of your subconscious then I STRONGLY recommend 'TNT-The Power Within' by Claude Bristol. This really hits home, is written in a very easy style which doesn't dilute the power of what the author is trying to teach.It's incredible, and you will never need to read another book from this genre again!"
2,"Poor printing, impossible to read","I hadn't seen anything written about this prior to purchasing the book. However, the practice routines at the end of the lessons are printed with black ink on a black background. They are impossible to read. If I want to practice what the author ""preaches"", I will need to purchase the CD for another $13.95."
5,Nice surprise,"Didn't expect much and I was pleasantly surprised. Nice picture quailty, comical characters, good soundtrack. Had a nice funky attitude that was refreshing in a stale atmosphere of gangster movies."
4,Australian crooks,"I at first bought this on VHS as an error but later the DVD version that I remember having seen on TV many years ago, I live in Denmark. The story is a vicious gangster wants to control all the slot machines in Melbourne and the figthing, and killing, that involves and more so when the Boys from Chicago also come around. An action filled story with good actors, Bryan Brown as the vicious boss, Toni Colette who tells him to be tough, Sam Neil a corrupt police officer ( there were some in Australia I have been told ) John Goodman comes along from Chicago to defeat local competition in the slot machine business. Some nice country views too. I was unable to copy the photo of the DVD showing these 4 actors."
5,A stunning piece of work!,"Mr. Keneally is PROOF that music is NOT dead. In a time where 9 out of 10 songs sound as if they came straight from American idol, it is hard not to drive the car off the nearest cliff in fiery protest... BUT... then comes Mike Keneally who seems to carry the torch of genuine creativity, like his mentor Frank Zappa, Mike has the ability to create everything from the abstract to the mind-blowing beautiful; from funny, to thought provoking. Wooden Smoke is one of the greatest compilations I have heard in a long time. I highly recommend it!"
2,not a karaoke version,"The music on this was fine, good even. The problem is there is no background singing either. It would of been beneficial for the kids to keep on track with the song. But as I mentioned the music and quality of the tracks were fine."
3,Meant only for the mathematically inclined,"Some math textbooks do a great job of actually teaching you the concepts on their own. For example, if you miss a lecture over a certain chapter, you can feel confident that you'll be able to learn the material by simply reading the book.This is not one of those books.If you miss a lecture, you'd better have a tutor available to explain the material to you, because this book is definitely written for the mathematically-inclined. However, the study guide/solutions manual is a little better in this respect, but not by much.None of this really matters though if you're a student, because you have to use whatever textbook is assigned to you. Hopefully, professors will read this review before making a decision as to which textbook to recommend to their administrators."
1,Sucky Service,"I expected and PAID to have this book by 8.20.10 and one week later (today being 8.27.10) the book is still labeled as ""shipping soon"" I paid expidited shipping and the book has yet to arrive, nor do i have any information about it. I need this book to get homework done, and it still hasnt arrived. !!!DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PERSON!!!"
5,Terrific,"Outstanding work. This book will be enjoyed by all Star Wars fans, young and old. As Den would say, ""If this isn't a terrific book, kill me now!"
5,"Whoa,are those Jedi tough!","This is guite a good book. I llike it because it exciting. You really FEEL the same things that the charactors are feeling. Sort of like in #6,The Uncertain Path, when Cerasi dies. I felt the same way that Obi-Wan did. It is the same way in here! What I am trying to say is , keep up the awesome work, Jude!"
2,It's okay,Maybe it's just hard to get used to but we seem to be able to get more lemmon peel using a small cheese grater then the Zester.
5,excellent support and comfort,Bra fits perfectly and provides great support for high impact exercise. Bra has good life span also. Bought bras like these back in December and they still fit snuggly. Currently replacing my cheap sports bras with these Champion bras. Only negative - the seams across the chest are visible thru thin work out shirts.
3,Eh,It looks nice. I like that it gives me a little cleavage but this bra runs way small. I could barely get it on. I do a bit of weight lifting and I'm a 34C in everything but I think because of the style I will need a 36. Not sure how it works with sweat since I haven't worn this outside of just trying it on.
4,not too constricting,"This is a good bra that doesn't flatten you out. I think some people might have problems with the seems though, depending on your activity, as there is no inner seemless fabric panel."
3,Comfortable but odd shape,I am keeping this bra because of the comfort but the mid seams on the bra cups ripple if you don't fill the cup; it looks like you have extra nipples if you are wearing a tighter fit shirt.
4,Great Fit,"This white sports bra is exactly what I was looking for.No removal pads like other sports bras that fall out when washing, which is a real pain.Great amount of padding where needed. Size is perfect."
5,LOVE IT,"I love these sports bras! Nothing is moving no matter what you are doing, and they give you a little lift so you don't have to be as flat as a pancake just to keep things in place. Yay!"
2,"High Build Quality, but not curved!","Stellar Rubis quality, but the tip is not curved; the shape of the rounded tips make it ineffective for really close trimming."
1,Romantic Comedy Review,"First, I DID NOT LIKE THE SUBTITLES and the DVD split in half coming out of player. I have since ordered the Wedding on a single DVD from a different provider.I was disappointed not to see Julia Stiles in the second one...the chemistry was not there (although it was good)the third, Honeymoon, was a bigger disappointment because Luke Mably was replaced:( That was like Robert Pattinson being replaced in Twilight! The Prince & Me franchise could have been bigger than Twilight! We need romantic comedies in the world today."
1,Prince and Me Double Feature,"Finally got around to watching and to my disappointment enclosed was the Honeymoon which is the third movie to the series not the first and second as advertised. False advertisement. Tried to notified Amazon and because it is past the return date will not even give me a link to let them know about the packaging error. What a shame, I guess service has a time limit. So please do not wait to check things out completely not just the case but inside contents as well."
2,Both delighted and disappointed,"When I got this book and paged through it, I was delighted with the baby blankets and I've decided to knit several of them. I was also excited because I love the ""Yarn Shop"" series. Debbie Macomber captures the spirit of a Local Yarn Shop beautifully.So was I bitterly disappointed when I looked up the recommended yarns for the project. These are yarns that are available in large chain stores, not in local yarn shops. I can appreciate that people are interested in knitting affordably, but there could at least be a mix of yarns. Much of what I loved about the original books is the knitting community that takes place in a local yarn shop. Having ALL of the recommended yarns in the pattern books come from chain stores betrays the premise of the stories. The stories could not have taken place anywhere else, yet the companion books send you to buy yarn from the very stores that are driving small shops out of business."
2,Need more basic detailed instructions,"Since I'm a beginner, this didn't have enough detailed information to start a project. The illustrations are beautiful though. When I get a little bit more basic knitting, I'm sure this book will come in handy."
5,It's fun to knit along with the story...,If you are an avid knitter and you are reading this book you may find yourself wanting to see the patterns and maybe trying them out yourself. This is the perfect complement to the novel as it lays out the patterns for all the items the ladies are making in the book. I've done one of the blankets so far and it was fairly easy to follow the pattern.
4,Hooks Served Sweet & Moody,Jangling guitars transport one through another bittersweet song suite. Fran's singing grows ever more substantial. Great band delivers yet again.
4,Thumbs up!,"I'm a huge Travis fan and have enjoyed every single one of their albums. (including 12 Memories) I've listened to this new one around 20 times since the 8th of May and still love it. Selfish Jean, Closer, Battleships, My Eyes, Colder and the hidden track Sailing Away are all instant Travis classics.If you liked Travis before, this album is more of the same. Go ahead and buy it.If you haven't like them to this point, you still ain't gonna."
5,Excellent book on hand planes,"This book seems to be the very best out there on the subject of hand planes. If you are clueless about how to set up and use various planes, as I was, this will largely clear it all up. I initially thought the the first chapters, which deal with the history of the plane, were just going to be fluff. But I learned a good amount of useful information there too. I wish that the iron sharpening section went into micro-bevels and tertiary-bevels, but not so. All-in-all, it's the best single source of written hand plane instruction that I've seen, and it is very good. You may want to also look at the Rob Cosman ""The great Hand Plane revival"" DVD."
4,A beautiful book,"The Handplane Book is a beautiful book. It's an excellent introduction to the aesthetic pleasures of handplanes (if you liked Sandor Nagyszanczy's Art of Fine Tools, I expect you will like this book, too).There's more to this book than aesthetics. Garrett Hack provides an excellent introduction to the practical side of handplanes. There are a few areas where other experts disagree with Mr. Hack (e.g., whether one must lap the sole of a plane flat, or whether one should snug up the depth adjustment to ""take out the slack"").As another reviewer commented, this makes a great coffe table book--but it also makes an excellent and inspiring workshop book. I recommend it whole-heartedly."
5,"Well written, excellent historical review","IF you love history of tools, this is the book for you. Every nook and cranny of handplane lore is explored in this book. It leaves the reader with an thorough understanding of why handplanes are made the way they are and the enormous variety of needs they fill in a woodworker's shop.Very well written. Thoroughly researched."
3,it's okay,need to have a greater selection of ear pieces in order to fit properly. had to purchase separate ear pieces because the ones supplied still didn't fit well.
1,Broke on the first use!,I couldn't believe it worked for two or three photos and died. The wires fell right out of it! What do I expect for chinese made garbage?!
4,Get the picture...,"This remote shutter does exactly what it's supposed to do - it's small and neat - the only problem is that the 36 inches you think you're getting is coiled so tightly it's much shorter in practice - it can uncurl, but might tip your camera over on the tripod.But it's worth the price unless you want to go to the kitchen to make a sandwich while taking the picture:)Oh, and the seller - Satechi - was fast with shipping and had great follow up customer service - I'd buy from them again in a second!"
3,"Entertaining for TV, but why are the lead female characters so stupid? :(","I found 24 to be very entertaining and fun to watch each season, but I found it very hard to stay interested when all the female characters outside of the CTU female characters are astoundingly lacking in any sense or intelligence, especially when stuck in dangerous or life threatening situations. They act like they have no brains and that is irritating. However, if you can ignore that really frustrating aspect to the show, the plot and other characters are very clever and interesting."
3,"Yes, I know torture is now legal in the U.S. and all that. Still....","While this chapter of ""24"" is very suspenseful and well made, I found the graphic, gratuitous scenes (at least 3 of them) of torture, twice perpetrated by the putative ""good guys,"" too sadistic to stomach. They put me off to the point where I will no longer watch this show."
4,A Second Day in the Life of Jack Bauer,"The stakes are up in this season as Jack battles to save Los Angeles from a terrorist nuclear bomb. This has as many twists and turns as the first season. Unfortunately, Kim, Jack's daughter, is involved in an unrelated plot line that distracts from the major one. Particularly since Kim makes bad move after bad move. Starting with the second season, the DVD set contains a whole seventh disc of extras."
4,Pretty Good Product,This was a really good season. I got this season used and it was in slightly used condition but i was still satisfied because all the discs were in mint condition. I hoghly recommend this product.
5,The Best DVD Box Set Ever Made!,"This DVD Box Set for 24: Season 2 is absolutely incredible! If you love the show as much as I do, go out and buy this now! You will not be sorry, it is worth every cent! There's nothing like having a commercial-free, 24 marathon whenever you want! Plus, this will prepare you for October 28th's premiere of Season 3, also commercial-free! There's no question, 24 is the BEST thing on TV right now! Happy Watching! :)"
3,"Great Show, Horrible DVD","I've only watched the first 3 seasons so far. They're all great... The problem with the DVDs are on the menu.Almost every disc's and episode's menu, show an image of something important in one of the upcoming episodes. So, you, pretty much, know what's going to happen, and it can really ruin the show.I've been putting my hand in front of my face to block the top half of the screen, while switching to the next episode. It actually works alright, but you have to remember, each time, to do it. Be careful...They could've, at least, included a ""Play All"" feature for each disc.Anyway, the only problem I had with Season 2 was with Kim Bauer (Jack's daughter). She gets herself into many ridiculous situations. It was a little far-fetched, as were a couple other moments... But I still love the show."
1,Dont waste your time,"The DVD is garbage along with the show. So predictable if your looking to get a good DVD get the Shield its awesome compared to this crap , hey you cant compare anything to this crap."
5,Amazing!,"Although there are a few plot lines in Season Two that come up again in Season Three, there are limitless new twists and characters to spiral the story along. Your assumptions are not safe and you cannot depend on political knowledge to make your guesses here. Excellent season that helps viewers see the progression of Jack Bauer's character and his biggest personal struggles. It's a fun season full of suspense."
5,24 - Season Two,"24- Season Two, was excellent, The service at Amazon. Com was great, and timely. This DVD was addictive and great. I searched the internet for the best prices and Amazon beat everyone."
5,Helpful book,"This book has been very helpful to me in determining what areas to be aware of in my life. In dealing with people that are involved in the occult, I now have the information I need to keep our home safe. In dealing with my own family generational sins, I can pinpoint and eliminate possibilities of curses and cleanse our lives completely. I'd recommend this book to all Christians or those who desire to cleanse their lives and turn to God."
1,setting the truth of the gospel back5000 years.,"As a Christ follower who has been truly set free by Christ and what he has done, this book uses scripture in such a way that makes what Christ has done for you and I as null. Are you kidding me? After Chapter 5, I wanted to chuck the whole Kindle in the trash for holding such contempt for the true freeing message the Gospel really holds. This book is a real danger to those young in their faith walk. And it is yet another book on religious things Jesus himself spoke against. If one is to believe some of the things this authors states, then it is doing what Paul warns us about in trusting false doctrine. YES I SAID FALSE! Read the gospel and the new testament for yourself before even reading this junk. At least the new testament tells of truth and of whole truths, not so half truth and fear. Lover of truth, the way and life. Peep I suggest you choose life as well. Remember it's a choice. Real Christians be advised."
3,Very soothing! Don't have to be a fan .,"I wouldn't say I'm a fan. I only own two of her cd's. 'Barbara Joan Steisand' and this one. They are both different and because of that I like them. I feel she is often overated. She tries too hard, maybe. She is not ""over the top""; nor does she try to be on this one. Whether your a fan or not, try this one out. It's good. It will surprise you. A classic!?"
2,A curious effort,"She sounds so beautiful at times on these songs, you don't notice at first that she doesn't seem to know exactly how to properly interpret them. She seems afraid or in awe, and it sounds like she sang them in pieces. Plus, she affects exactly the same tone for every song. I couldn't help but wish that, at the time, she could just have gotten over herself and called someone like Leonard Bernstein and allowed him to guide her. If she had been able to do that, this album could have been great. As it is, I label it a curiosity."
1,Not the same,Just recieved. Only to find the item is not exactly like the picture. It should be 1 inch bother at all sides..but only come with the top border.
5,great product,My check engine light was coming on caused by a vacuum leak at the gas cap. Replacement of the cap solved the problem.
4,John F. Mullins - Days of fire,"John Mullins has become very famous worldwide because the computer game Soldier Of Fortune. The game is based in this book. If you have played the game you know it`s a lot of acton in it, have you finished the game why don`t read the book, cause the book is very exiting. If you have played the game and want to know John Mullins better, this book is for you."
3,Texas export,"Frustratingly inconsistent, but the song ""Mary Had a Little Drug Problem"" is one of the greatest sonic blasts of post-punk nihilism I've ever heard. Worth the price of the CD alone."
1,Incomplete,"Help me out. If anyone has figured out how to access the all-important pdf files supposedly on the 4th CD ~ let me in on the secret. I've tried every way I can think of to find something besides audio files on these discs but cannot. It is useless to me if I can't do the reading exercises to follow along.Apart from that, as with many self help programs, they spend way too much time selling me on a program I already bought and take their time getting around to making a point."
2,Written for her daughters,"While the premise of this book is a great idea, I picked it up hoping to read about the wives of the great men that founded our nation. Instead, some of the chapters are about women that had nothing to do nor had any effect with the founding of our country. The book is dedicated to her young daughters, and, alas, that is the age level this book was written. I love to read about history, but don't like made up conversations or incidents that the author must put into the character's mouths, as she tells the stories in first person. I wish she had stuck to her premise and written about the wives of the men who founded the nation. As a father of four daughters, I seek to see the women's point of view all the time, this just failed in that regard and as other's have said, is meant to inspire young female readers. In the teen section of the library is where it belongs."
3,Really three-and-a-half on 1-4 star scale. Widmark and Carradine good together in this bittersweet Western about...,"Frontier Lawman in early 20th Century,set up to look like he killed 15-yr.-old farm boy and ultimately hanged.Clint Eastwood's old buddy, GeoffreyLewis (also did a 1978 Hawai'i Five-0episode) in here too. Beat Steve Mc-Queen to the punch (McQ did Tom Horn6 months later before The Hunter, hislast)."
1,Don't buy! Save your money!,"This is a lousy brayer. It is out of round, off center and generally junk. There are gaps in the ink that will not cover on the plate or block. Save your money for a quality brayer."
2,Not worth it,"It came with the wrong timer... thus dispensing 0.5 cups of food at a time... way too much for my cat. If you decide to get it, make sure you get a timer with a ""seconds"" option so, in theory, you can actually control intake. However... don't count on it for a cat... within 5 minutes of opening it my cat had figured out how to dislodge the food cap and get into the area where it comes out. This, in part, was due to the see-through storage container and the gap that enabled him to smell his way to food. This enabled him to get to twice as much food as he should have. Also- the system does not give a sealed storage area... thus leaving it wide open to bugs."
3,Aussie Blues on the Front Porch,"Jeff Lang and Chris Whitley[from U.S.A.] were friends so, consequently there styles musically are similar. This is a good thing because they're both not copy-cats of anyone or thing.If you like Whitley you will probably like Lang.If you aren't familiar with either then by all means check 'em out.This would be the CD to buy to begin listening to Jeff Lang.It's a compilation so that's a good choice cuz the songs are all quite good.Yes it is kinda ""raw"" but it's well-done!!"
5,Wyndham Was Respected by Orwell for this Book,"Wyndham's power derives from his tendency to be reactionary. Orwell, Pound, T.S. Elliot and Lewis all began with leftist tendencies, and evolved into a realization of the folly of superimposed mind control as practiced by the left. This novel is a stark satire of these ""artistic"" propoganda aspects as channeled through art. To attempt to label Lewis with all the ghastly ""--isms"" is to attempt to superimpose a like kind of modern leftist template over a wonderful '30's rebellion against exactly this kind of labelling. Hard as it may be to believe it, this putative thought control was even worse then, during the political ascendancy of communism."
4,Simple and fun Christmas book,"We recently purchased this book and my kids just love it. It is a simple story about a small fireman who helps out Santa. I don't LOVE the illustrations, but they are nice and my kids think the story is so great. They really like that Fireman Small delivers the gifts in his truck and that he isn't sure if the whole thing was a dream or not, until he gets the note from Santa. They also enjoy the rhyming scheme. Very fun book!"
3,Puzzling,"3, maybe 4, good songs and they do suffer a bit from the malaise of late '80s undie rock and that was getting louder and more violent as the bands had less to say. Side 2 still feels pretty much like a total loss and ""Big Money"" was ok, but was not great, so why the 45 release? Still, a better album than I'd probably like to admit and it WAS influential, for whatever that's worth."
3,Download Speed,I chose this rating because your download speed is ATROCIOUS...It took me more than 2 hours to download this game when it takes less than an hour for me to download something twice this games size in an hour. Stop limiting your download speeds or I refuse to download games from amazon anymore.
2,A good concept gone wrong,"This could have been a good series, but after all the premarital, extramarital and unnatural sex was featured it turned into just another soap opera. Worse, it exploits teens as alcoholics, sex objects and totally without realistic ambitions."
1,Did;t watch,"I can't review it as I didn't watch it. I might have by passed it, but honestly can't review as I did not watch"
5,"Great show, great actors, great directing!!!!","This is a great show! All of the characters are very likable, even if they are not nice. The actors all do a great job with their roles. You will fall in love with the people from Dillon and go away wanting more."
1,Poor Video Quality,I have nothing to say with regards to Amazon because they're shipping & service are great compared to other online stores. I have been waiting for the 2nd Season to come out and was glad when amazon got it first and bought it before the release date. But when i receive the DVD i was disappointed regarding the quality of the DVD. It wasn't even in a DVD quality compare to the original season. And that is only my complain about this product. Though i believe that the season will be great as same as the first one.
5,AmIBLACK?!?!,"Maybe not, but in the world of brilliant music this cd makes the grade. It is so shiny and round, and the picture on the cover is such fine art. In the cd, though, is the music and it is even better than the cd case...which is made from such fine plastic! The music is fun and happy. Its also sad and mean. Sometimes it can be nice though. I love it. I would buy it if I could. I cant though since I'm very poor. Will you please buy this for me?! I need it, I am so deprived. Im addicted to this band. But I've still heard it. It is very cool. It is good stuff, this music. Music is fun, and this cd is music! (PS_While you're at it will you please buy some of my cds? My record sales are down which is why I am so poor! Thank you!)"
2,Nice product but fan should be more reliable.,"Nice power supply, very good, stable voltages, but fan is terrible quality, started to make noise after a month of use.Was forced to buy another fan and replace this noisy fan.Here is an update of my review. almost 3 years passed and PSU died. Disassembled it to find out why and saw a leaked capasitor. Very very disappointed...."
4,bev hills 90210 season 8,as we all know season 8 is coming to DVD november 24th first off season 7 was great ending season finale with the cast gaduating now we get to see them in the real world we see donna and david move back in togther for a short time in the season and we also see kelly and brandon struggle with what to do about their realship when she gets shot and has aminisia and what the gang does to try and help and we also see the last full season with Jason Prestly as brandon 2 more to go after this november go get yours when it comes out i know i will also 1 more season till the return of luke perry lets keep the final 2 coming
5,I have always loved this show.from 0 to 10 with 10 being the best i would rate this a 8,This show is all real life problems that happen.Some of the things that happen are kinda stupid.But for the most part it is a good show.And it can help in a way.So you should start from the first season.I think most women would like it allot
3,Beverley Hills 90210: Season Eight,I am a massive Fan however season 8 was really the down point in the collection. Lots of drama but Donna (Tori Spelling) is just annoying. Great to watch on a Sunday after a big night...!! Bring on season 9.
5,Great product and excellent story,I would highly recommend this series for any shojo fans out there. It shipped quickly and it arrived in 2 days and was still in the packaging. It is a great series and definitely a fun story line.
3,review,the dvds were ok although i still found the prices to high i would have bought the box set for much less on ebay but i needed quiker shipping the product pleased me but the price didnt
2,smaller than I thought,"I bought them and they are smaller than they looked. I still have them and have never worn them. They are too small, like they would be for a child. I waited too long to return them, so I'm stuck with them. They are pretty, I might give them to some little girl some day."
3,Pretty design but too small,"Perhaps I did not carefully read the dimensions if they were posted. Although these are beautiful earrings, they are too small to really enjoy their beauty."
2,Nice earrings but very small,The earrings are nice and of good quality but they are much smaller than I thought they would be.
4,Awesome,"Sonny Chiba is at his best in the Soul Of Bruce Lee. Every Kung Fu and Karate artist must see, because he shows his awesome Shrinji Kempo skills. Plus the other three movies are impressive as well."
4,A viewer from Dominican Republic A good book,"This book is good for people who are begining to learn german, if you are about to start a journy in which you have to get in touch with germans this book will be usefull."
5,Until Then,"I had the pleasure of seeing Calasaig perform live, in Toronto. At that time I purchased Until Then and have been listening to it constantly ever since!This CD is wonderful!This is traditional Celtic music with phenomenal musicians who bring life and character to some old and some new songs that we all love. The combination of Kirsten Easdale and Keith Johnston voices is hauntingly beautiful and truly shines a new light on traditional Scottish music.This is a CD that I am proud to have in my CD collection and any future CD's by Calasaig are more than welcome!"
1,DOA,"This computer has self-unzipping operating system, meaning that you must install the operating system which is a mostly automatic operation. In my case the operating system would not unzip after repeated efforts. HP tech support spent over an hour with me on the phone unsuccessfully trying different jump starts. Overall, I wasted a day trying to get this computer going. This is the first HP product that caused me problems on initial startup. I can't understand why HP would not install the OS and fully test its products prior to shipping. Amazon's return and refund policy worked well but I cannot recommend this product."
3,More of a curiousity...,"I found most of the stories in this book to be kind of average. The Neil Gaiman story was pretty good. As for the illustrations that accompanied it, I thought the first illustrations were the best.Ted McKeever's story is very good because it treats the Matrix like the real world with a character that has great depth for a short piece of fiction. And the art was very original for this story, too.I also liked ""Hunters and Collectors"", but I'm a sucker for any loose analogies or retellings of Melville's classic story.The art, for the most part of this book is great. It's the writing that doesn't perform as well as I expected. Most of the stories don't take any chances or take you to different ground in the Matrix world, with the exception of McKeever & Gaiman's stories.I'd recommend the book as a curiosity piece to anyone's library."
3,"Not great, but not bad","My copy came from the $1 store, so I had little to lose but a few hours reading time. The story is not terrifically different, but Ms. Holleman's hilarious dialogue and vibrant twists of phrase make the whole thing fun. Not recommended for those unused to fiction from the seedier side, this is a graphically streetwise novel of the ""noir"" variety. In fact, it's anachronistic at times, and clearly written from a fantastical view of urban life, but that makes it a perfect read for ""lose yourself"" times. I will gladly pay more for Ms. Holleman's next book!"
5,interesting and enlightening,I found Holy Terror to be interesting in the manner the author develops characters throughout the book. I have to ask myself how the author can identify with so many personalities from the priest to the prostitute. I thought I have lived a quite varied life but realize I would only want to learn of this darker side through a book such as this. When is the next book due?
2,Torture,My Dad's favorite- I purchased for him and have been subjected to it many times- unadulterated torture.
3,DVD,"A good movie, I expected much more laugh, but eventhough it didn't happen, the story envolves you quite enough so you enjoy the film. From 0 to 10 I'd give it a 7!"
5,Student Manual for Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy (Workbook),"I have found this student workbook very helpful learning the 11 approaches to counseling and psychotherapy. I really enjoyed how they dealt with the same client, Stan in each chapter applying another therapeutic technique. There is also a DVD titled Theory in Practice:The Case of Stan that was helpful. This workbook sure did give me an edge over my peers. Enjoy!"
5,Great Purchase,The item arrived in the exact condition and within the given time frame. Thank you very much.
4,well done,"This was a very artistically done documentary. The European suicide girls are just as attractive as the ones from the states. Every girl that had a photo shoot had a chance to talk about the inspiration for their shoot, as well as give some background on the suicide girl movement in Europe..."
3,nothing much to talk about,"is it just me or did this book not make much sense at all about tells? halfway through, i felt there were some contradicting arguments in the book..be wise and borrow this from a friend.."
3,"Useful, but update the pictures already","It is a little disturbing that this book was published in 2003 yet, the pictures are roughly 20-30 years old. Keep in mind, that things haven't changed too dramaticly over the years, but for the price I'd suggest buying a more specialized book on your game of poker. While his tips are accurate, there's nothing too spectacular here. Worth buying used."
1,outdated,"It's full of bad black and white photos that look like they were taken in the '70s with players in disco cloths and mustaches, and dealers with big bow ties that looked like they stepped off the Blade Runner set etc... not at all representative of 'what' you will see when you play.All kinds of tells concerning Stud poker and other games i don't play...The text reads like an 'Amway come-on speech'.There are a few interesting ideas but overall this book is poor."
1,Buy the video.,"I purchased Mike Caro's VIDEO on tells years ago. (I bought the VHS but, of course, it's on DVD now.) It is an updated version of the book and it is excellent. Actually seeing visual examples of the tells is a much more effective and easier way to understand this material. With a video available, there's no reason to buy this book. If you can't find the video on Amazon, it's advertised in poker magazines like Card Player (which is available for free in poker rooms) or just google mike caro. It costs more than the book but it's worth it."
4,noise-pop gems from the touch & go stable,"i got this cd off a friend of a friend, i hadn't even heard of the band, but the album came highly recomended.the beauty of this album lies in it's lack of pretention - seam effortlessly blend the skewed dynamics of slint with the noise of my bloody valentine, but do so with only a slight debt to either band.relying on great songwriting that never does more than it has to bring together a coherent album, definitely seam's finest hour."
4,Great for a new or intermediate knitter,"I've only been knitting for about a year and I learned so much from this book. At first it seemed like a collection of knit tips from a magazine, but once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The ideas are from people who know all about different stitches and methods of knitting - things you only learn from having done a project many times. Some ideas I knew, but most of the ideas presented are practical ""how tos"" that will really help improve my knitting and how I approach projects. I have recommended this book to several people. I keep it in my knit bag and have used it frequently. I only gave it 4 stars (I would have chosen 4+), because some of the concepts needed more or better illustrations."
3,Not a lot to it.,"I picked up a couple of tips (and I got the book used at a very low price, so I can't complain) but there's just not that much in here. The chapter on machine knitting has a couple of very basic obvious tips. There are some tidbits, but I sure wouldn't pay more than I did for it."
4,Our Xact XS052 Home Kit,We ordered this Home Kit so we can hear our music in our work shopwhen we are out there. We listen to Country Music (is there any other).We really enjoy our Home Kit.
5,Great product,"A little goes a long way, I use it to flavor apple juice and 1 tsp. will work for 3 gallons of juice."
5,Awesome,"I love Cinnamon, so I made lots of tooth pics.This is a great product and very powerful.I recommend it to anyone that likes cinnamon.Thanks!!!!"
1,bad product,this smells right but after cooking tasted rancid. when I called and they said it was OK and did nothing a bout it.
5,Excellent all around source for all word origins,"I've been using this book to source the meanings of scientific terms since 1980 while I was taking chordate anatomy and mammalogy at the Univ. of Washington. I now use this book routinely in preparing lesson plans and lectures for my high school biology classes. Knowing the meaning of the base words often helps the students retain and integrate the term into their vocabulary. The book is invaluable. My favorite word breakdown so far has been the scientific name of the Long Tailed Weasel, Mustela frenata. The literal translation is ""the masked ones"" (frenata) ""who carry off mice""(mus- tela). If you are unsure which reference book in this category is the best book for you, I suggest that you go to the science library of a university near you and find this book and compare it to the books near by. It is by far the easiest to use."
3,Looks good...but...,"I convinced my daughter (age 7) to buy this game with her money in hopes that it would favorably compete with her current TV viewing schedule. The graphics and 3D aspects look great and the game seems interesting to play (for me). My daughter who loves educational software AND simple arcade type games finds this program boring. This is likely because of the ships transit time between events. For gamming fun, she prefers to bring up my copy of Half Life in multiplayer mode (without any other players) and explore/navigate around the environments."
3,A nice video but not quite what I was hoping for,My two year old adores hot air balloons. It is difficult to find a DVD that focuses on hot air balloons exclusively. This video comes close but I think it includes too many cut aways of people milling around or waiting. It's all about the balloons people. Not so much about tourists.
2,Not too happy,"Sorry to say, I am not happy with the HB HealthSmart Contact Grill. No temperature settings and the one time I used it one of the burgers burned slightly while the second one was ok. Regretably, when I ordered this one I did not know that there was one also available with temp. control settings which I would have preferred to purchase had I known what I know now."
2,it works :/,its works. but the tray does not fit well. the light cover fell off the 1st time I cleaned it. the design makes it harder to clean then other indoor grills I have had.
2,Be Weary!,"First, if you're in the States, seek out the domestic version of the single it has the two tracks from this disc plus another Jack number. Here's my thoughts on the songs included on this version (from a review I sent to a friend of mine):""Who's A Big Baby?"" - I was geeked b/c I figured, I'd now have a proper Meg track to makeup for the creepy, brief ""Passive Manipulation"" (from the new album). This was not to be. The track is a B-side to the new album in every sense, read this as: Weird, unexpected and featuring a marimba. Meg's ""vocals"" are digitized and creepy. They ""lyrics"" seem to chiefly consist of ""Who's a big baby?"", ""Waaahhh!!!"", and ""I want my Mommy!"" Utter bollocks. I'm shuddering as I listen to it.""You've Got Her In Your Pocket (Live)"" Northern Ireland August 25th, 2004 - The live version of Pocket is wonderful and a very welcome breath of fresh air after all that Satan experimentation! Jack does a great job playing this one live."
4,Great Read,"Well written, engrossing and can't put it down.I am enjoying this book better than The Red Tent; another biblical novel.Recommend it."
3,"Good effort, some disappointment","Although Karen Armstrong has made a good effort and has exhibited a wide range of overall scholarship, ""The Great Transformation"" was a disappointment when it came to her understanding of Ezekiel's vision. She sees the Merkava (chariot) as a ""war chariot"", written in response to the Babylonian exile, and as being a ""terrifying, confusing vision"" (Page 398). Since Ms. Armstrong's book is on the Axial Age, it would have been better for her to approach this vision from the standpoint of a meditative experience that could bring a person into the awareness of oneness. There are elements of this vision that are common to the meditative experience wherever it arises, within whatever religious tradition it takes place. Ezekiel's vision is a description of and a metaphor for this experience, and not a ""war chariot."" For a scholarly elucidation of this subject, Aryeh Kaplan's book ""InnerSpace,"" Moznaim, 1990, discusses Ezekiel's vision in detail."
5,Something different,"A little something different for the mundane daily ritual. The taste and the scent is truly Jasmin, but if you thought your toothpaste smelling/tasting like jasmine is a bit strange, no need to be concerned. The taste/scent is not overpowering and is quite nice and does jazz up the boring task of brushing one's teeth. The package is nice in that it is easy to squeeze out the toothpaste - I have used Tom's of Maine in the past and trying to get the toothpaste out, especially towards the end, was rather difficult. The marine mint flavor is really nice as well."
3,Good but not the best one Marvis offers,"I tried both the original Marvis Toothpaste (the one in the green tube/classic strong mint flavor) as well as this flavor.. It is still minty but a tad too subtle for me. I prefer the orginal one since it has a very strong mint taste and makes my breathe feel fresher then this one does. Don't get me wrong, this one is good just not as a stronger mint as I prefer. For those of you who do not like really minty flavor or a strong mint odor, this one would be good for you as it is on the subtle side...I will continue to use this flavor until it runs out then I will stick with my favorite, the Original Mint by Marvis...B+ for this flavor..A+ for the original mint flavor.."
5,A definite beautiful and must-buy album,"This is one of those Streisand albums that just shines out between the others. Her working with Rupert Holmes was certainly one of the better things she has done (and a shame she hasn't recorded another album with him since - pls note Streisand fans - that Barb's second B'way album had to be with him and she recorded several songs in 1988 - including a gorgeous ""How are things in Glocca Mora""). ""Lazy Afternoon"" is such a well chosen song project that Barbra can still sing contemporary material and yet not sacrifice herself in the process. Mostly ballads, laidback, beautifully arranged are sung like all us Barbra fans dream of. ""Moanin low"" brings back memories of the younger Streisand (and make us wish she should pick more material like this she can belt out!). A really lovely album, though it is sometimes forgotten when Streisand's major albums are mentioned."
4,A Personal Best For Streisand,"I am not a Barbara Steisand fan, but this CD, that was released originally in the 70's as a record was good then and is still good now. I think it is one of the best things she ever did and I am sure will ever do."
3,"Good suction but cheap, bad hose","I've had this vacuum for over a year now. It sucks up dirt very well and even does a pretty good job with dog hair on certain rugs (though not all). However, the hose is made of the flimsiest, cheapest plastic and is constantly kinking while I vacuum so I suddenly lose suction and hear a roaring noise. It's getting worse and worse--I'm considering trying to track down another Eureka hose that might fit it? It's too bad they had to scrimp so much on the plastic and not use a thicker, sturdier ply. I also agree with the other reviewer about the cord--it gets tangled a lot, could also be better designed."
1,Clash of the Egos,"One of the worlds most mediocre photographers tackles one of the world most mediocre pop stars to arrive at one of the most mediocre photo books in the tradition of Anne Geddes and Celine Dion. Looking at this Soulless, vapid rubbish is a little like listening to Kravitz soulless, vapid music.For 49 bucks go and buy a real photography book - Tony Ray Jones or Bruce davidsons 'subway' or if you simply have to look at celebrities then Richard Avedon, or Irving Penn. Don't settle for this publicist appeasing hack-work."
4,Short and sweet -- if you don't mind getting creative!,"For a graduate school class on meditative practices, I used this book for an experiment. I took the verses and memorized many, and changed the rest to suit my particular situations. I made up new verses -- in the same style -- to complement situations not described in the book. I found this to be an effective way to minimize my daily stress. As just a book for your nightstand, this one will probably not be useful or very interesting. But for someone with stress or anxiety, or someone just interested in Eastern religions, it may be invaluable. Such a collection is certainly not easy to find, and the writing is clear and unambiguous."
3,TIVO Review,"I agree with the positive comments about how TIVO allows youto see the programs that you want to see. However, I want to warn those who do not have a great deal of familiarity with electronic items of the difficulties I have had. I have been unable to find a service that is familiar with TIVO. Most TV repair and satellite experts are not familiar with TIVO and therefore they are not very much help in integrating its operation with DIRECTV. As I am not adept on electronic matters, I have been frustrated with the difficulty of getting it work as it should. I have placed it back in its box until I find someone who has one and knows how to install it. Jane"
5,makes TV a whole new thing,TIVO is like Disposable diapers...Once you move to this nobody will ever go back.
4,Very Noisy,"I love this thing. It has changed the way I view television. But be careful. It makes a lot of noise. I put it in our bedroom, and it grinds away all night. It drives my wife and I crazy. I checked, and there is nothing wrong with it. It's normal noise for the type of hard drive they use (a cheaper version that the quiet ones that might have added a little to the components cost)."
1,"Dead on Arrival, Bad Customer Service, a Waste of Money","The Tivo arrived DOA. After waiting 24 minutes on the phone on a call I had to pay for, the customer service rep was rude.I was then told I had to box up the unit and ship it at my own expense to the service center.Instead, I returned it to Best Buy and got a ReplayTV."
3,Great Product - REALLY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!,"Tivo is a lot of fun, we have thoroughly enjoyed it for the 4 weeks that we have had it; until it broke. It would not have been a big deal, sometimes you just get a lemon, but the customer service at Tivo is horrible. Extremely long wait times for Tech support (my husband was on the phone for almost 3 hours), then they finally decided to send us a new machine - they made us pay for it in advance, shipped it UPS ground, and sent a refurbished machine. They said their policy is only to ship new machines if it breaks within 14 days of purchase. So, just keep this in mind when ordering."
3,Give more facts about what also is needed for Tivo,"I noticed looking at all the info on the web sites that nothing is mentioned about needing a satellite dish. The product doesn't come with one. It has to be ordered in addition. Also, nothing is mentioned about needing a second cable run from the satellite dish. Normally this is an additional fee because houses 99 percent of the time are not wired to accomodate two feeds to the back of a dual recording receiver. Two incoming feeds are necessary to get picture-in-picture or to be able to record one thing and watch another....I also noticed that nothing is stated about additional multiswitches being needed if more receivers are being added.I think that more information should be included in the product decription"
1,Replay TV Better,"There is one reason why Replay TV is better and that is because you can connect to the service via broadband. As the most sophisticated and tech savy people have broadband, this oversight by TIVO is a real slight to us."
3,tivo review,Owning my Tivo has been really fun and convenient. Its not that I watch more TV its just now I watch the shows I actually want to see. It is excellent taping shows and not having to stay up. I usually tape music videos that only come on at night. Perfect. The only dissapointment was that you can't skip commercials with TiVo which I thought you could. I guess I should have checked that before I bought it. Oh well. They also advertise a little bit? what's up with that? Hopefuly that goes away
4,Really really like my phone,"I've had this phone for two years now and I really really like it.So the ring tones are a little high pitched. Whatever. The important thing is that I get clear reception, light weight, and long battery life. It is easy to use - the buttons feel good to me and the menus are intuitive. The blue backlight is also really nice. Sometimes I use it as a flashlight in the dark!The one issue I have had is that once in a while when I speed dial a number, it somehow changes who I'm calling to a different number. Not sure why or how that happens, but it is so infrequent its not a problem.I don't need a camera phone or bluetooth, so this has been great phone for me. In fact, I have the option of upgrading to something new right now, and I'm reluctant to swap it out! :)"
4,amazing,"My R225m phone is awsome. Its been beaten, scratched, and thrown agains a wall (so i have anger issues). The phone generaly gets good reception, but when it seems to have full reception it makes alot of noise for the person on the other side of the phone. The biggest drawback is i cant connect it to my PDA... cheap PDA and cheap phone."
2,Don't spend good money on this phone,"I have had this phone for 22 months, and the volume is highly variable, the ringer stopped ringing, the battery life is just ok. It's a really basic phone, there are so many more great phones out there. Skip this one."
4,old reliable...,"Recieved this phone as part of the sign up plan the cheap way. One went for a drink and revived after being dried out, then the second one we own, got missplaced by mistake in the driveway and got ran over... It still works fine except for the display... I am not fond of the menu selections, or battery life, but it does take a licking and keep on ticking like a timex. I recommend it as a basic phone that could see some rough use, with some extras you might not expect."
2,NO,"If you are a Dylan fan looking for more great stuff like Blonde, Highway, or Bringing it all.., then please use extreme caution if considering this CD. If you are not a fan of The Band you will hate this CD! This CD has received much critical praise over the years primarily due to the story behind it and not so much for the tunes themselves. There are many Dylan fans that just simply hate this one."
1,Missing parts,"The Food Mill arrived quickly, but I am going to return this item because it is missing the grinder plate."
1,"Convenient, meant to put 5 stars, whoops!","This mill is one of the best things I've ever purchased for my baby. No more baby food for the most part. Now, he can just eat what we are having, within reason. It saves time and money for me. Works great, especially if you crank the handle fast. I'm surprised what will go through it!"
3,Works OK,"I wasn't as impressed as I'd hoped with this item. It does a pretty good job pureeing soft foods like cooked fruits and veggies, but it does seem that there is a fair amount of food leftover. Also, you have to put just the right amount of downward pressure otherwise the top part just goes down and the blade attachment comes popping out. Not quite as user-friendly as such a simple gadget should be. Still, it was only $10 and it does puree soft foods."
1,Baby Food Mill,"I have used baby food mills before when all 4 of my children were babies, a different brand. This product was a big disappointment and did not work well at all. The top grinding piece is plastic (not metal) and was very difficult to process the food through. On anything other than soft vegetables, I had to often ask someone to help by pressing down on the cylinder while I turned the handle. It has no gasket at the bottom of the cylinder and any liquid would run all over the counter. I would not recommend this mill to anyone, it was a waste of money, I quit using it after a week."
3,This product was ok,I was so excited to get this but then dissappointed when the food jammed and it took forever because I kept having to take it apart. On softer foods it worked ok. Our baby surpassed the need for food this mushed up and moved on very quickly. Not really worth the money.
2,"Without stainless strain, doesn't work","I bought one of these 3 yrs ago when my first son was small. This one had a stainless steel blade and strainer. It worked great! Easy to use, disassemble, wash. Then, I lost it and had to get another. The current plastic strainer is VERY difficult to take off of the base, it doesn't grind food well unless it's very soft and it's hard to clean. Overall, the product has gone way downhill as far as quality and ease of use. If the stainless blade were to return, I'd give it 5 stars."
1,"Hard to use, clean & in general, not good.",I broke two of these trying to strain peas & green beans. You really have to over cook/steam the vegetables for this to work well. My friend who has to puree her daughter's food for the rest of her life recommended the bullet. I've been using it & it's the best so far. More expensive but i also use it for myself(chopping onion & smoothies). It's also about the same size of this food mill that's hard to use. My son is 18 months now & I still make his apple sauce with the bullet that I've had for about a year now.
3,My old one had a metal grinding plate,"I'm using it for my old cat, who needs fresh foods. Had one for my kids and gave it away. It was almost identical with the exception of a metal grinding plate, which was sharper than the plastic one in this mill. This mill takes more down force, much more. It is very hard to use on meats and even cooked rice takes hard pushing. I am returning it."
2,Not the Clark's I know,"I have a pair of Clark's that I've had for 4 years that I love and are still holding up. When I saw these online, I expected them to be the same quality, comfort and sizing! I purchased the same size as my previous pair, and they were huge! They also lacked any kind of arch support and seemed generally flimsy. Perhaps it's just this line of Clark's that's a shodier quality."
1,Disappointed,"I do not know how Bonnie got this item. It certainly was not from ordering the above product. I ordered thinking it was for the gun. Must be my mistake!!!! Instead I received the pellets. Only problem was I had already ordered pellets and needed the gun. I contacted the company after I received the package (with an additional 4.00 postage) and was told that the description did say for the ""SoftAir 1,000 Pellet Quick Loader"" so that is what they sent. Never mind that the details were all about the gun. I then had to go and order it from somewhere else. I will NEVER use this company again!!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Cool soundtrack,"This is a very good soundtrack, and ""Blue Monday"" by Orgy is an awesome song, and ""Hey Now Now"" by Swirl 360 always puts me in a good mood. I love Jennifer Love Hewitt's ""How Do I Deal."" I don't remember ""Try To Say Goodbye"" by Jory Eve being in the film, but it's a nice, soft soothing song. This soundtrack is totally awesome, and I would recommend it to anyone. You won't be disappointed."
3,Love saves the day!!!,"On listening to the mainly bland trash metal of this soundtrack I find myself immediately smiling. ""How Do I Deal"" lifts the album - and hopefully the career of Love. An infecious melody coupled with strong vocals - Brittany Spears must wish that she had the talent of this girl. Worth buying if only for this track alone."
4,Great Approach and Tips For Performance Testing,"Although I have not read this book extensively, I have still found sound advice in its pages. This book is a great guide to anyone who wishes to learn more about, or conduct Performance Testing. From Bottle necks to security, this books covers a broad range of subjects. For a reliable source of testing information, directed towards web applications and more, refer to this book. Thank you."
2,Looks nice! BUT............,Built like a tank. Toasts like a wank! Someone must make a toaster that toasts as good as it looks. This is not the one. The toast is always darker on one side. And it toasts the top of the bread darker than the bottom. I'm sure of this review because my brother has the same toaster and will confirm everything I just wrote!
2,What a beating of a game!!,My daughter who is about to turn 4 loves this game. She wants to play it constantly. So it's good for their entertainment value but bad for yours. The dresses are hard to get on the dolls and they rip and tear very easily. It takes as long to set the game up as it does to take it. There are also some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having to go as far as the die say but you can't go over that numbers i.e. you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that's allowed. That's confusing when you're trying to teach your kids their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you'd be rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you're trying to reach.
1,Waste of money,"The concept is great. What little girl wouldn't want to play a game where the goal is to have her dress her princess for the ball. However, the game pieces are horribly made. Two of the dresses have already torn (after only playing with it twice); the crowns don't fit/stay on their heads; and the purse and flowers fall off. This makes for a very frustrated little girl. In addition, the game rules are confusing and the cards are too big for the layout of the board - they get knocked out of place over and over. AND the set up/take down is a nightmare. I am afraid the game is a loss. We will keep the dolls and dresses for maybe another week until they are all torn or lost and then throw the whole thing away. A BIG waste of money and not recommended at all. ~Rebecca"
1,Don't WASTE your money!,"Simple reprint of an apparently VERY OLD film reel.Both movies were entirely GRAINY all the way through.Well, I should say partially ONLY because I didn'tfinish A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Courtbecause I just couldn't bear the ridiculous poorquality of the movie. I would give this piece of junka MINUS STAR rating if it were possible but Amazondoesn't offer that option."
5,Excellent intro to ancient coins,"This was the first book I purchased on the topic of ancient coins, and it provides a first-rate introduction to the hobby. It's a good general overview of what is available, and is written in a style that is welcoming to the greenest of beginners.This book would be a very good ""first book"" on the subject, and it would also make a great gift for someone who is just getting started on an ancient coin collection, especially for the price!"
5,my new brake pads,I purchased these for my 2007 kia optima to be installed in the rear and I must say they perform very well. Reasonable price and great performance.
5,works well,I've had this locked installed for three months and my son hasn't destroyed it yet. It is pretty sturdy and hasn't loosened at all.
3,Makes using the bathroom for adults a hassle,"We installed this into our master bathroom so we wouldn't have to keep the door shut all the time. It seems to be working at keeping the toilet seat down. The problem is whenever I try to use it myself, the lid will fall on my back instead of staying upright. Whenever my husband tries to use it, the lid will fall down ""mid-stream"". Messy and gross. My husband now only uses the guest bathroom toilet, which we have not installed the lock on. Kinda defeats the purpose of keeping it locked for my daughter's safety when it's so inconvenient that we only lock one toilet."
2,Rather sophmoric look at the future,"Hear ye, Hear ye! It is the future and Earth is over populated, the economy and the ecology are near ruin (sound familiar?). So, as an answer the (in)famous form-changing, mind-altering machines are invented that allow anyone with enough money to become whoever or whatever they want. (How this goes about solving the previously listed problems is not explained but then this IS fiction).Naturally there is a bad guy (who may or may not be bad) and there is a tracker, Beh Wolf (ain't that knee slapper) who must find and make that determination as to which category he falls. There is a lot of business, several conversations, but one can never forget that this is just a book - and an unconvincing one at that. Wolf runs into the same problems and even uses the same dialogue as 19th century detectives (only jazzed up with techojargon). Unfortunately it appears that this story duo will become a trio."
1,fifty years in the feri tradition,"This book is mostly anti christian garbage. What little information about feri tradition is totaly useless. Dont even bother. this book is a waste of time, effort and money."
3,"Good philosphy, but feels stuck in the 1950s","I read this book with a women's church group. We liked the main ideas, the 5 ""p"" theory, and identified with the author's feelings. However, her ideal of motherhood was to do everything for her husband and keep the house, children, etc. perfect for him all while spending 2 or more hours a day in prayer. She should have really been a nun!The book left most of us feeling inferior to her supermotherhood and guilty for not living up to her ideals. Most of us, however, view our husbands as equal partners in parenting. So from that point of view, the book just had strange priorities.Miranda"
3,"Good idea, not so good quality.","It's a nice phone. The features, size and design are good. The menus are easy to use and to customize. The microbrowser works fine. The voice quality is fine, and the phone is comfortable to use.The problems are with the construction. Maybe it's a little TOO small and light. Don't drop it. The SIM card cover pops off too easily, the hinge feels a little sloppy, and there's a little crack in the LCD glass on mine. It looke like the software crashes, too. Every so often the screen freezes, then it will turn itself off after a few seconds.None of these problems are show stoppers, but I think I'll get a different model next time..."
2,What you pay is what you get!,"I bought this phone because it was a cheap flip phone. The battery does not last long at all and the quality of my calls are poor. I constantly drop calls and sometimes I don't receive my calls. Also it is difficult to hear from the earpiece even when on high. It's annoying when the envelope doesn't dissapear after you have checked your voicemail messages! It is also very flimsy. I like T-mobile, but I don't care much for the phones that are offered."
2,BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL...PHONE NOT DURABLE,"I have small hands and the buttons a still just to tiny, i use my fingernails to press the buttons. I dropped it the second day and the back of the phone cracked. The V60 is much better!"
1,Not as advertised,"I was sold a book in new condition with CD-ROM; however, a used one was sent/received and without the CD-ROM. After some emails with the Seller (wasabi1031) I was able to receive the CD-ROM a few weeks after the book. However, the book was not replaced nor was I compensated for receiving a less valuable book. I would not buy from this Seller (wasabi1031) again or recommend anyone else to this Seller (wasabi1031)."
2,the CD is missed,I love this book. I expected the CD inside of this book but it's not there.Please check if sellers offer CD-included book.
2,Version 1.0 - Still Needs Work!,"The functionality and price of this product were very appealing. However, I was extremely disappointed to find that this Version 1.0 product was very incompatible with 2 different capture cards and computers I own. Worse yet, the Tech Support leaves a lot to be desired - - hard to reach and even harder to get solutions. I had to eventually return the product. After several e-mails to their support people (unanswered) and long distance phone calls to their California sales office, it was eventually learned that it did not support either of my hardware devices. I will buy it again after the bugs are resolved, but it really needs work."
2,Please lengthen the 'wings'!,"As stated in other reviews, the idea is great, but they don't account for a large percentage of us with a wider gap between the doors. We have the mirrored closet doors. The wings aren't long enough to work on these. Please list the length so that people do not buy these unknowingly and end up having to pay return shipping on a $3 product! If you really want this idea to work though, consider lengthening the wings so that the rest of us can use this product successfully."
2,A little disappointing,"This gadget worked great for a couple of days. But someone pushed a little too hard and it popped off. I had cleaned the area before applying the adhesive, so I thought it would last longer than it did. I put on a second one and it did the same thing. It also took off some of the paint from my sliding door. It is a wonderful concept, and I'm actually thinking of putting a different adhesive on the back of it and trying again, because I loved it while it was working."
3,"good, not perfect","I purchased these for mirrored sliding closet doors. The only problem is that the doors are not as ""flush"" as the wooden doors pictured here. So, I had to fold up pieces of cardboard and attach them to the item so that it was tall enough to block the other door. Then, the adhesive that was included would not adhere to the tape I had to use to attach the cardboard. So, I ended up taping the thing right to the door. It doesn't look pretty, but it works great!! Since I haven't found anything else that works, I would recommend this item if you are able and willing to do a bit of tweaking on your own. However, I would suggest that the manufacturer take this into consideration and include something to make the product work for everyone out of the box."
1,"Bad Adhesive/Cheap Plastic, won't hold.","I purchased this set for our entertainment room, which has sliding doors on the closet that houses our electronics. I placed it higher and it popped off the first time my kid tried to open the doors. I placed it more towards the middle, like some other reviewers, and it popped off again. My husband installed TWO of them, one higher and one lower, and the things just popped right off.I tried some better adhesive, but then the locks stayed on the door, and instead the little ""wings"" just folded right under the (front)door.I guess for now we are just going to have to keep redirecting until I find a better lock."
1,Not going to stop anyone.,"I couldn't wait to install these to keep our toddler from getting in to mischief. However, two good pulls on the door and the plastic piece came flying off and the baby now had free access and a choking hazard. It definately was not strong enough to handle a child that knew how to open the door. Not what I had hoped for."
1,Did not last,"These were great in theory, but did not work for me. Of the two that came in the pack, one would not stick to the door, and the other stuck but popped off after about 4 uses. The one that popped off took a fair amount of paint and wood off the door as well. My child was unable to open the door while it was installed, but the locks would not stay on with normal use. Seller was quick to ship, and price was great. I will keep looking for a better solution for the kids closet."
3,Blend of historical and contemporary Africa,"A worthwhile read describing the status of the modern day Tsavo parks in Kenya set against the more interesting, to me at least, historical background of the same area. I'd have given this a four star rating had it not been for the author's apparent lack of research on the character of David Livingstone, who was badly if briefly misrepresented in the book. I would take some issue with the author's views on hunting as well but I felt that He at least remained fair-minded as a non-hunter himself and I would not skip the read because of it."
3,5 for production values; 2 for plot,"Street Kings is a slick, well designed movie with a compact, tightly woven script. Sets, lighting, acting, props, join together to make a brilliant visual mosaic but it's a perfectly designed story that's been told dozens of times: the lone troubled individual who--in seeking the roots of corruption--finds that the entire world he has been living in is a facade of propriety and is actually rotten from the core. It's a thrilling ride as you see Keanu Reeves seek out the source of police corruption with lots of seat of your pants action, shootouts, killings, near killings, revenge, turncoats, corruption and all the rest of the paraphernalia, but a roller coaster or a circus act can be beautifully wrought and executed as well. It might be a great ride, but it's only a ride."
3,"Alright, pretty much forgettable though","There is not really much to say about Street Kings. It is overall a pretty cool movie, but it is nothing too special. After about 30 minutes in I was able to guess what would happen, and there was no really big surprises. The action scenes are good, while the acting is alright. I thought Forest Whitaker was a bit over the top. The story is ok, and pretty easy to follow.Overall I liked it, but I was not thinking about it too much afterwards. If you are looking for some special features of any kind you will have to get the more expensive version. The cheaper one only offers commentary and TV/Movie previews."
3,Tough to like any of the characters,"Keanu Reeves stars in this movie where all the cops are bad. Just some are worse than others. Pretty bleak, and none of the characters are very like-able, making it tough to watch. Also, the script is kinda generic, as is the acting. I did like the dark look of the film, and the fact that it really doesn't sell out at the end too much."
3,Keanu Is Good - Ending Could've Been Better,"Street Kings started off well. But somewhere along the line, even with James Ellroy at the story's helm and a strong cast, Keanu Reeves despite his best performance can't quite carry the movie to the end. Worth watching and some of you might have a different opinion. I give this 3.5 stars."
1,I found this book to be not very useful.,"I don't want to know all the details of the inner workings of Installshield, I just want to know how to use it, and this book doesn't offer much of that.The ""simple, basic"" install procedure (finally presented deep into the book) leaves out one important step, dragging the ""link"" files into the Installshield from Explorer. One of the illustrations does show that step, but the written description of the operation omits it.Having followed the process described in the book, I did not get the results described. Repeated attempts got the same results, but not the ones described. That is to say, it doesn't include the actual installation of the program.Since the book states specifically that they ""do not offer technical support"" there is nowhere to turn for clarification. So, having spent money and several days on this book, I still am not successfully creating deployments with InstallShield."
2,You get what you pay for,"Well, I went ahead and bought this at the reduced price. It was good at first and then other people were having problems hearing me and I was misunderstood because of this headset. Thankfully, it wasn't one of my important calls and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me. I am returning this product because it is just not worth it to me if the other person cannot hear me properly. I do like the design of it and the fact that you get to choose how you place it in your ear. I don't care about it otherwise."
1,Noise in background,This is a poor quality product. Lots of noise in the background. Look for something else.
1,"I'd love to give this item a higher rating, but...",...it never arrived. Had to have Amazon refund my money. The worst part was that this was a Christmas gift for someone and I was empty handed! Beware when ordering cell phone accessories through Amazon - apparently they have shipping problems.
2,What? Huh? Hard to hear. . .,"The earpiece for this bluetooth blocks sound out too much. My last bluetooth could be worn all day and I would forget I had it on. This unit also has a lot of issues with interruption in the conversation. Either the party I am speaking to complains that I am 'breaking up' or I have trouble hearing them because they are breaking up. It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality. I will use this until I find a better replacement. And believe me, I will look a lot closer at what is out there instead of wasting any money on inferior products."
4,Good buy for the price,"I didn't want to get an expensive bluetooth headset because most of the time I just don't need one and I tend to lose things. So, I went with this one and wasn't disappointed. I think it has much better sound quality though there is a barely there static mentioned in an earlier review. The ear loop fits fine if I'm not wearing my glasses, but if I have my glasses on as well it tends to fall off after a few minutes of walking and moving about. So I couldn't give it a 5. It synced easily with my EnV and holds a charge for a very long time. I don't use it for long periods of time so I only charge it every few days. A good buy for the price."
1,Doesn't work,"I have a side-by-side fridge, so I put this on the top. While lined up correctly, the pieces totally miss each other - the ""catch"" is too high to actually stop the bottom piece."
4,mike kinsella is at it again,"Owen sounds like the name of a band, but closer inspection reveals that Owen is in fact one man -- Chicago's well-known Mike Kinsella. A multi-instrumentalist who has worked with well-known indie rock bands like Joan of Arc and Maritime, Owen is Mike's way of holding artistic direction over his own work. Owen's fourth full-length album is thoughtful and creatively structured; it's further evidence that Mike doesn't need other people to craft an album worth listening to. But one problem is that tracks on At Home With Owen may be improvements, but are they mind-blowing? No. Nevertheless, fans of Mike Kinsella will not be disappointed, and the album is definitely one that suits a foggy day in the country."
4,Very good book but not one to start.,"This is a good book, but unless you can understand ""Old English"", I would not recmmend that you start with this one. Its basicly written that way"
5,Disney-It doesn't get any better than this!!!!,This has to be the best DVD released in YEARS!!! It certainly was worth the wait. The video is so clear it looks like it was just filmed yesterday. Audio just has to be heard on a great surround system. Disney you deserve 5 stars for this!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Still available....,This DVD is still available at Disney online. Just ordered mine yesterday and it was shipped today!
1,Way overpriced.,"I remember seeing 'The Scarecrow Of Romney Marsh' on the Disneyland television series, and would love to own this DVD collection. However, I refuse to pay such a high price. I would buy this item, but only when the price drops to a reasonable and affordable level."
3,Dr. Syn,I didn't remember the footage being so dark. It is hard to make out some of the scenes because it is perpetual night
4,good book,book was a bit beat up but it was what i expected. pretty good for the price though. gets the job done.
1,No book,I didn't like the service of this person. Only after I had already paid that they realized that they didn't have the book. I had to rush order from someone else. (at least I had a full refund. )
5,Over and over,"Way back when, I played this album over and over. I bought it again(twenty odd yers later) and every time I play it, I hear the most enjoyable sounds of my life."
4,breakaway,"Garfunkel in great performance, sings beautiful songs. Lyrics by Tom Jobim, S. Wonder, Gallagher and Lyle, Paul Simon ..."
3,Meh..,This album is okay. I dont really have much to say about it because its just my personal opinion. He could have done better.
4,great game-poor constuction,"My daughter-4 yrs old-loves this game! It it great to see the wheels turning in her little mind as she thinks about what to ask next. The game moves quickly-as quick as you ask your questions and that leaves room for a few good games in a short amount of time. Would definitely recommend this and have given it as a gift with great reviews as well. The only downside is that the plastic is cheap and breaks easily. Lastly, devote about 15-20 minutes to ""set up"" prior to the first play. There are alot of pieces to break apart and then put in their place."
3,Cute Disney Toy,"Young Disney fans enjoy the challenge of figuring out who their opponent's character is... The little character cards slip out of the holders too easily, though."
1,Jobsite Phrasebook,"Good for other construction insdustires, but it is not for the pre-engineered steel buildings and homes- It does not have translations of many, many, many words we used in our industry in this book."
5,Excellent!,"It took me a while before I really got into this album. In the beginning it was 'strange', other than the other music I was listening to then. But after a few listenings it really smashed in! The guitar riffs and solo's are marvelous, melodic and very well done, the drum tracks are great, the bass is rich and the keyboards have good melodies. The whole album shows Becks need for developing, really expressing his emotions, without any frontiers. Some parts are pretty jazz-rock like, such as Led Boots, others are more blues oriented. But they all have that really great and typical Jeff Beck sound. Together with Blow by Blow and There and Beck you'll have the masters best albums, and years of joy in listening music!"
3,The Gun Jams,"The guns jams frequently and is terrible for Nerf Wars. Shoots 20 feet max and is slow to reload. Decent for close range combat, that is what it is intended for, 3 stars."
1,drop n' break,I bought this gun a few years ago and I just rememberd to write this reveiw. First of all the left barrel didn't shoot AT ALL. Next when my sister dropped it the thing broke. the gun is a peice of garbage and you should not buy it.
2,"Fun, but breaks very easily.","I really liked this toy, it's just...it doesn't last long. Take it from me, I've had three of these. (The price on amazon is horrid, I got this at Wal-Mart for 10-15 bucks.) Anyway, I go to the store. I see this, and I think it's a nice idea. When I buy it and go home, I was cutting the strings that were holding it to the box. You see, I mistook the string in the middle that cocked it for a safety string. So, I cut it, and you can see where that went. Now, that was entirely my fault, but they could at least put something to cover the purposely exposed string. So, I returned it. Second one lasts me a month. It broke on the inside somehow. Returned it again. Third one lasted longer. This time, it broke externally, on the hinge that held the the two main parts. At that point, I didn't want to buy it anymore."
5,great fun but not very durable,"this is a great toy it shoots far and powerfully but, is anoying to relode in a battle without teams. this toy is very good for snipping not from so far of a distance. it is fun to relode but, in a hyspeed battle i would go with the belt blaster. overall worth the money"
4,Works well for the price.,"Works as advertised, only issue is the top dart never flies as far as the bottom one.Still a good purchase overall."
4,Aggressive but not as well recorded as previous efforts,"I wasn't excited with this album upon first listen, mainly due to fewer layers and a smaller guitar sound than on his Blue Murder or Whitesnake albums. However, this effort has a bunch of great songs and some of Sykes' most aggressive (dare I say ""Punk"") guitar work. It's a surprising album and one that has had staying power."
4,Powerful!,"A novel so intense and authentic that the reader feels as if the stock of a Garrand has butted them in the jaw. One can smell the cordite and experience the flash of incoming shells as they huddle in a shallow fox hole that might well be a premature grave. Know what it is like to drive home a dagger when it is the heat of hand to hand combat and you only have your own skill and guts to rely upon. Few novels approach the height of realism and magnificence as this volume. If you have the desire that lives in the heart of all real men to know war but have have been tied down at home with family responsibilities, or if you wish you had been born in Germany prior to WWII so you could have participated in the Big One, then this is indeed a book you must read and Paul Watkins an author you will want to remember."
1,Waste of money!,"I'm an tennis official and bought it to take to work at the US Open, but it came apart the first day I used it. The nylon frayed at the top portion and separated from the botttom. I'm having to pin it to keep it together so I can keep my water cool on court. What a disapointment! And I'm still in NY and can't return it yet!!!"
4,convenient way to carry a water bottle,"I got these so my family could have their own water bottles at DisneyWorld. The strap made it easy to sling across their body, so they didn't leave it behind on a ride or somewhere. They were very handy. The only drawback was the insulative part really didn't keep the bottle cold for very long in the hot sun, but it was still great to have an instant source of drinking water and not worry about stopping all the time to find a drinking fountain. My 5 year old even carried his own bottle without complaint or loss."
5,LOVE this PRODUCT!!!,"Honestly, I was leery of this product, the price was so much lower than others I've seen on this site. But it got such great reviews and since I only needed one for my 'walks,' I figured I'd try it. IT IS PERFECT!!!! My water bottle fits snuggly inside of it and the strap is plenty long enough to wear across my chest (which is the easiest/most comfortable way to wear it when walking/hiking). So glad I listened to other reviewers!!! Be careful to order the correct size for your water bottle--these do come in different sizes. Also, I received this item lightning-fast and nicely packaged."
4,The best songs are better on a different CD,"Although I don't own this particular CD, I would still recommend ""Bob Dylan Live 1975 (The Bootleg Series Volume 5)"" in it's place. Six of the songs on the ""Desire"" CD are on the other, and from the snippets I heard here, the arrangements and the band are better on the Live CD. Those songs, by the way, are Hurricane, Romance in Durango, One More Cup of Coffee (the Valley Below), Isis, Oh, Sister, and Sara. Carmen Rivera performs beautifully in the live shows, but someone else (not sure who but not Joan Baez) sings the backup vocals. Emmylou would have been nice."
3,Desire is an uneven Dylan collection,"My biggest gripe about this album is there are way too many songs with Emmylou Harris singing harmony. The song ""Hurricane"" is about the destructive power of tropical storms and is easily the best song on the album. Songs like ""Joey"", about some union thug who got killed, go on for what seems like forever, though. Less Emmylou and more Bob and this might be an album on par with ""Blood On The Tracks""."
1,"I do not ""DESIRE"" it at all....","Very weak album by Dylan. Totally lost. only ""HURRICANE"" is great track, altough een this one is tediously, overwhelmingly long!"
4,Coverage of C# specific to Mono,"Turns out there is more to making C# cross platform than I thought. Turns out the majority of the core of .NET is cross-platform when you use Mono, but the UI portion is not. So the book mainly concentrates on the use of GTK#, spending about 80 out of 250 pages on it. Other sections include XML processing, networking, core .NET, and installation.The well written, concise, and focused. This is a strength, and a weakness. The book may be too focused by design. Which leaves you in a situation where you don't have enough book to be valuable on it's own. You will still need O'Reilly's Programming C# book to start learning C#.I recommend this book to anyone looking to start with GTK#, or who is interested in porting their C# code off the Windows platform. I do not recommend this book for someone just starting out with C#."
1,"Great style, but content is severely out-of-date","It's been about five years since this book was published. You'd think it would have been updated since then.The most obvious sign that this content is too out-of-date to be very useful is that it was written for Mono 1.0 and the Mono project is currently at version 2.4. By Chapter 2, I'd already come across several instances where the information written about Mono 1.0 no longer applies to Mono 2.x. While I liked the style and presentation, the content appears to be too unreliable at this point to be of any help to developers starting out with Mono.I'm surprised O'Reilly is still publishing this book and selling it at full price."
5,Excelente servicio,Amazon respondió muy rápido y completamente seguro y confiable. El libro lo recibí incluso antes de lo notificado por Amazon.
2,Not among Lewis's best,"Some of Lewis's movies are among my all-time favorites (Nutty Professor, Who's Minding the Store, Ladies Man), but this one is quite bad. the scene in the beatnik bar is pretty good if you are a Lewis fan. Young kids might like the flick - I did when I was in grade school - but the humor is very forced, and they try to wring too much of it out of repeating the same ""spaceman with special powers"" scene over and over."
5,Wake Up Everybody,Love it! This album (CD) has always been special. It has an excellent selection of songs that everyone can relate to and will love!
2,Not as good as others,"I didn't think this book was as good as Create Your Own Dinosaurs or Create Your Own Zoo. The proportions are wrong, stickers too big and it isn't easy for chldren to make it all fit."
1,Bad phone; worse service,"I received this phone/pda from Amazon. Unit was defective. T-mobile replaced, but only after spending HOURS with tech support (which by the way takes at least 20 minutes to reach after the CSR transfer the call). T-Mobile's coverage was really bad -- could not make calls in urban areas in California (e.g., LA, SF). I cancelled the unit during the 14 day trial period. I just received a bill from T-Mobile for ""partial service""! Would not recommend this phone or service to anyone."
3,Not for the Non-Geek (Geeks Only),"I love the phone, despite the fact that there are a lot of features that are buggy.Just understand that you are getting a slightly buggy device, with erradic internet performance and a somtimes echoey(for the other user) speakerphone.Thats all I got to say. Love it, but its buggy."
5,A real eye opener,"Dachshunds are very loving and wonderful dogs, but they are also some of the most stubborn creatures that you will ever meet. This book really helped us to understand how to train and relate to our new puppy. We were ahead of the game when it came to potty training and discipline because of this book. I highly recomend this Dachshunds for Dummies for all dachshund owners (both present and potential)."
1,Is it safe?,"The vase looks snazzy, I'll give it that. But when I got it, I washed it and soaked it in hot tap water (no stove, no soap) to make sure it was clean. When I took it out, it smelled like turpentine, and the smell didn't go away for several weeks. It seems fine now, but I still don't trust it enough to put it in my aquarium and it now just adorns a shelf nearby.I'd bet all of the plastic ornaments like this will have similar problems. Beware."
5,The Rabbit Hunter,"John Feinstein's look at Bob Knight and the 1986 Indiana Hoosiers is actually a inspired fleshing out of Frank Deford's bonus piece in SI on Knight, ""The Rabbit Hunter."" Feinstein, like Deford before him, understands that Knight is a man who can never let it drop. But, because he never gets off the horse, his teams often achieved greatness. However, in 1986, Knight's gift for exactness wore thin and the team didn't reach its potential. Of course, the kicker to the story is that the 1987 team cemented Knight as an all-time coach as it overachieved as much as any team in the past half century.Feinstein's journalistic skills are on display with a narrative that reads like a novel. His best book, and for my money, the best book ever on a coach, and that regardless of whether you love or hate Knight."
4,Like being an assistant coach for Knight,"A very interesting read which lets you get in the head of Bobby Knight and see what it's like to be a part of his team for one season. The answer: it's hell. You see Knight as both a brilliant coach and student of the game, an incredibly dedicated friend, and an out-of-control maniac."
5,Restorator Bike for Arms and Legs is great!,"My Dad's Occupational Therapist suggested he get one of these, so we ordered this. What a neat piece of equipment. Lightweight and can be used for arms and legs strengthening. Delivery was quick and product is very good."
1,Buy something else,"Unit is really noisy! I mean really loud, makes this loud buzzing sound. I turn the radio up as loud as I can handle and I still hear the buzzing sound. For all that, the amount of neg. ions this thing puts out is very little, if I put my nose down beside the unit I can smell a little of the negative ions, but in general no noticeable affect inside the car."
3,Keep the secret going,"This isn't what you think it might be, the cover leads you to believe that piranha play a major role, I believe they mentioned them for about two minutes. The rest was on the life of the people who live on the Amazon, that's no secret. Once you've seen the National Geographic documentaries it's hard to settle for this level of mediocrity. Pass on this one, its generic and not worth the money you'll pay, new or used."
3,One Album Enough,"Long time since I put my 12"" on the turntable, so I was looking forward to playing this CD.Nice catchy tunes that repeat the same theme in a slightly classical composition style, ala 'Yes' but they do not carry it off nearly as well. However, for a good relaxation session with no great expectations, this album still cuts it for me. Probably, in my view, this is Starcastle's definative album."
5,You should have seen them live!,"I saw these guys live several times before they made their first album at a small bar (Chances R) in Champaign-Urbana, IL. (Same bar REO Speedwagon used to play in before they made it). Their first set was this album and the next two were covers. They did a medley set of Beatles & Stones that kicked butt. They were all awesome musicians. OK face it, I'm a bit prejudiced, but you would be too if you had the chance to see them in that forum. I'll always have that ""live"" picture when I listen to this album. When I talked to them between sets after they had made this album they said the cover was made by a Disney artist (definately can see the similiarity)."
5,Do yourself the favor and purchase here,The book arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition. I actually had a lecture based on the book the day after it arrived and thanks to the timely delivery I was able to follow along and contribute to the conversation. I would recommend this product to anyone who is in need of the book and would like a immaculate copy in a short amount of time.
4,"GREAT, well worth it",This album is probably the 2nd best recording of the show ever. The first being the original. All the actors are incredible singers and I found myself really enjoying the new updated Rocky Horror.Go out and buy this album NOW
3,First band I ever saw,"It was in Asbury Park, of all places. Maybe 1973, maybe 1974. Look, I've got a soft spot in my heart for this band, and recognize Russ Ballard and Rod Argent had real talent, but this is really dated stuff. Very heavy organ, utilized in manner that you have not heard since the mid-70's, just make this a relic of a not unlistenable genre, but one which is not really all that missed."
2,Argent deserves better,"Some serious issues with this release.It's the epitome of budget hour.Skimpy short and there are absolutely no liner notes or credits whatsoever.In addition, this was released not long after CD's came out so sonically it's very lacking and in desperate need of a remaster.Argent needs an updated Anthology that improves the audio and adds a few cuts that better represent the band."
2,Far From the Best,"Of course, I am going to fall even farther afield than some of the other opinions here, but I really like the Argent albums after Russ Ballard left, ""Circus"" and ""Counterpoints"" which were Argent at their most zealously progressive. Since no songs from that period are included here, this is, indeed, anything but a best of compilation."
2,Blah collection,"I found out after purchasing this from Amazon that it is the same set as sold in David's Bridal. Ended up using very little from this set for any events leading up to the wedding. Not worth the money if paying retail, but would be ok if found on a clearance rack."
4,"Almost FIVE Stars, Perhaps not Quite!","No doubt, there is much in the is CD to recommend it! In fact, every song here is worth checking into, and you can play the entire CD through with nothing that would blast away at your eardrums. SUZANNE is a near classc,as is SO LONG MARIANNE with it's enchanting female chorus, singing just a micro second behind Leonard's gravelly lead. PARTISONS is another fine tune, and frankly the whole album is full of interesting, tuneful, and poetic songs. So why only 4 Stars? Probably the dreariness at times is overdone, and there is a sameness to many of the numbers! Even so, without question LC is surely among the very best of all the singer-songwriters out there, even with his pungent minor-key sadness at times becoming practically suicidal, with not too much happiness or pleasure to smile about!"
4,a truly great songwriter,"L. Cohen is a truly great songwriter and unfortunately not a great singer. This CD will help you appreciate his music but if you want to have a transendental experience find `Tower of Song, the songs of Leonard Cohen`. This CD is apperantly not available on Amazon. It is a compilation of his songs sung by other artists. The gem in it is Tori Amos singing `Famous blue raincoat`. I never knew so much emotion could be packed into 5 minutes. There are other great songs by P. Gabriel, T. Yearwood (don`t laugh she is good), J. Arden, S. Vega, Bono, Sting and a few lousy ones by A. Neville and W. Nelson. Please look for this CD."
2,runs small,bought this awhile ago in size 5. runs a bit small and definitely doesn't fit my ankle!!! how can anyone have ankle that small??? material isn't that great either. had to return with some percent taken off due to restock!
1,Los Personajes estan Influinciados sobre los Hongos Alucinoj,"E LEIDO MUCHISIMOS LIBROS ESPIRITUALES , PERO ESTE LIBRO NO ENTENDI NADA , YO PINSO QUE ESTA PERSONA Y LOS PERSONAJES ESTAN SOBRE INFUINCIAS DE LOS ALUCINOJENOS HONGOS , LAS HISTORIA ME PARECEN RIDICULAS !!!"
3,informative but sexist,"The Emperor's Egg contains many facts about the Emperor penguin. However, I found it pretty sexist! I am usually intolerant of over-the-top feminist comments, but this book had one too many digs on the mother penguin for me! I realize that the male is the one who keeps the egg safe for 2 months, but the author mentions the mother eating, getting fat, and having a nice time after leaving the egg, with the father ""stuck"" taking care of it. He then refers to the egg as ""his"" egg, not ""their"" egg, and talks about how miserable the father must be without food and how cold it must be, while the female is off living the life. All of this is nature. The mother does not leave the egg because she does not care. She does her part, and then she comes back. The book is good, but I did not care for many of the adjectives the author chose or the overall tone of the book. If anyone reads this book to our son, maybe it should be my husband. I can hardly stand to."
1,Shallow,"It is no wonder this book is out of print - it is full of exposition (pages on end) and reads like a history book. The plot is very thin - about one layer of discovery, after which there does not seem much left that is interesting. Characters are almost characterless. Deals with concepts such as prejudice and ignorance, but in a rather didactic and idealised manner. Not worth the effort."
4,Love Dr. Hook,"I just wanted to say, for those of you who are looking for The Soupstone, I have it on an album that was released in 1975 called ""The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan"". It has many other wonderful songs as well."
3,Not too bad but....,I got this book for more embroidery work on some SCA garb for medieval reenactment. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the work. It's not too bad but looks like there was a lot of liberty taken with the style of knot work. Looked a bit sloppy. I found the book Celtic Iron-on Transfer Patterns by Courtney Davis and feel this is a much better source for transfers and patterns. Looks more accurate and clean with a better variety.
3,Technically impressive craziness leaves room for songwriting maturity,"3 1/2The fearless instrumental group of experimental math-rockers blazed a small but distinct trail across this subgenre, layering drumkit assaults after angular riffs in a more intimidating way then most of their peers could ever imagine. Even early on, when the group often felt more controlled experiment then experimental control, a rhythmic complexity, anchored by an amazing, ever-questing drummer, never eludes the at-times fascinating interplay. The last few tracks helped rein in these overwhelmingly spastic hardcore jam sessions with a little more melodic development, hinting at further greatness to come."
1,Worst thing bruce has ever done!,"I loved Army of Darkness, Evil Dead 1 & 2 and Jack of all Trades. I even like alot of the crappy made for tv movies that Bruce made. But this series is the worst series that I have ever seen. Everything about this series is god awful!!!"
5,"Awesome actors, awesome show, awesome set!",This is a must have for any Bruce Campbell fan. Even if your not a fan of Bruce's work try this anyhow it's one of the best shows ever on TV!!! Way ahead of it's time!!! Once you start watching it you can't stop!! Ride on Brisco!
5,My dad loves this gift!,This item arrived quickly and was not broken in anyway. I'm pretty sure it was the best gift EVER given.
3,Would have been better if,"the booklet that was supposed to come with the set was included. I bought this as a gift for my wife (still can't figure out why she likes BCjr-lol). She was very disappointed when the booklet that she thought was going to come with it was missing from the DVD. I asked the seller, and they said I'd have to take it up with Amazon (forget the exact excuse, but it was sad imo). One of the perils of buying this way, I suppose."
3,"Beautiful scenery, eye-catching costumes but it's not funny.","Most of the scenes are not humorous at all. Bruce Campbel is more entertaining in Army of Darkness. No wonder this show was canceled after the first season.This show is worth renting not buying.""Quigley down under"" and ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" are still the only films on my list of Best Western Movies of All Time"
5,Great western/sci-fi spoof,"I remember watching this show when I was a teen in high school. It was funny and great action. The biggest surprise in the show for me (don't remember which episode it was)happened when Brisco Jr. and Lord Bowler were staying in a barn one night. Lord Bowler , the rough tough bounty hunter and Brisco Jr's rival, sings the gospel song ""Amazing Grace"". He sang it beautifully and I'm gonna buy the show just so my wife can hear that, but I suspect that we will be watching the show many times just because we all need a laugh and to forget the real world! LOL"
4,Good Teacher Helper Resource for Beginning of School Year,I like the format of the pages. It is a good little teacher resource book to get helpful worksheets to start the school year.
5,Will the real John Mayer please stand up?,"a thoroughly entertaining collection of songs performed with true talent in a manner that should effectively put to rest the atrocious comparisons to the likes of an amateur like John Mayer. Dave Matthews is an original who delivers songs of depth, joy and sadness backed by expert musicians.I almost left off a star because I feel that Dave Matthews is more enjoyable in a more intimate setting - but I certainly do not hold it against the artist for becoming so big that they need to play venues like this.Dave Matthews is in a league all his own. A worthwhile show in so many ways."
5,Awesome!,Easily the best band of today and probably of all time the Dave Matthews Band has always been known for putting out awesome live albums. And I have to say this is one of the best. What You Are and So Right are a ton better on here than the Everyday versions. Classics like Warehouse and Two Step rock on these cds. If you have never gotten into the Dave Matthews Band get any one of their cds.. but I suggest you start with Crash or Before These Crowded Streets.. easily the two best studio albums ever released!
4,African musicology,This a must have text for anyone studying African music and culture. I recommend this text as a supplement to any graduate level musicology course. It is not a dull text and provides valuable insight for those seeding to know more about African music. I used it as a main source for studying and preparing for my doctoral exams.
3,There'll always be an England??,This book and the following two can be rightly regarded as the 'middle' of the Barsetshire series chronicling as they do the end of the more innocent society prevailing in England before and during the war years and ushering in the more utilitarian and less picturesque social strata that would replace it.
1,too crumbly,I love the taste of these cookies but they were mostly just crumbs. I bought the dark chocolate as well and thet hold together like a normal cookie. I got a second box of the PB and they were still just crumbs and flour rather than cookies.
1,The worst cookie ever!!!!!,I ordered these cookies recently. When they got to my home every single cookie was crumbled in a million pieces. And they tasted awful. The worst cookie ever!! :(
2,Crumbs - Product was not as ordered,"I ordered cookies, but I received crumbs. I don't enjoy eating my cookies with a spoon. I'm never buying these online again, just local. I enjoy Pamela's Products, but I am gravely disappointed with the shipping/handling methods for this product."
2,Broken but Delicious,"My husband is gluten/casein free and misses yummy sweets. I ordered these cookies for him for Christmas thinking they would be fabulous. They came in handy individual packets full of completely crushed but delicious cookies. I should have called for my money back, but I don't want Amazon to discontinue the product, I just want the shipping problem fixed."
2,oily and rich,"These cookies are very rich, oily and smell so strong that you can smell them through a ziplock bag. We won't buy these again. They didn't taste very good."
5,pink power rules,"Who doesn't like pink power ranger? She is probably the only female hero my son will ever approve of- until he reaches puberty that is. I gave it five stars for educational value because he uses his power rangers to create conflict/resolution scenerios. I think it encourages creativity and free play-it's just not as obvious as the actual ""educational"" toys like leap frog, etc."
5,a really good looking shed !,"I hired a carpenter to build the foundation for this shed. We used all treated wood. 4 x 4's on the ground, followed by 2 x 6's for the framing, and finally 3/4"" plywood for the flooring. My carpenter took about 5 hours to level and build the foundation.After that it took about 6 - 7 hours for the both of us to assemble the shed. It snaps together pretty much flawlessly. I was amazed at how rigid it was once completed.After assembly I bought some olympic stain in a cocoa color to paint the foundation, it gives it a finished look.This shed simply looks awesome ! ... My neighbors all love it as much as I do ! The wife loves the extra details of the shutters, flower pots. I would definitely recommend the suncast shed to anyone looking for some extra storage."
4,Good for non-professional user,"I just play badminton in my backyard occasionally, so these are fine for my needs! Had them for a couple years now."
4,Underrated Album - Still sounds good,"I'd forgotten all about this album and went about 30 years from when I first listened to it until I bought it on amazon. It still sounds great, good songs, excellent musicians and catchy arrangements. Features a great contribution from the unfairly maligned Donnie Dacus."
4,Good Lil' Weather station,"Does what it says it'll do.Has been very reliable and the atomic clock feature is great!The design is cool looking too!I would have given it 5 stars but the forecast feature seems to be a bit of a waste of time... but I think they all are.It is a great little device and I'd recommend it, I think you would be happy with it unless you are some kind of a weather obsessed TV meteorologist and in that case you'd probably have already rigged up some other kind of Alberta Clipper predictin' contraption anyway.For the average homeowner it's great, go ahead and treat yourself to one or two today.you'll always know the high and low for the day as well as the relative humidity!I like mine, I like it alot..."
5,Superbly innovative and swingin',"The outstanding work of ""Shelly Manne and his Men, Vol. 2"" proves again Shelly Manne's flawless musicianship, and his hip innovation. All his ""Men"" are playing with the same superb quality, and this recording introduces the young, hot clarinetist/composer, Bill Smith, also from the West Coast jazz scene, into the mix. In the 50's Lester Koenig, the producer, asked Bill to write an ""extended"" piece to celebrate the new long-play format of the record industry, and ""Concerto for Clarinet and Combo"" was born. Shelly Manne and Bill Smith, innovators in the cool, intelligent sound of the West Coast, create elegant rhythms, explore musical structures, and set the standard for the absolutely most swingin', coolest jazz around. This is a classic."
4,a nice little stretch,"I am very pleased with this contemporary looking stretch bracelet...It is a great bargain, wears well with any attire...casual or dressy. It lays nicely against the skin and is so lightweight you have to look at your wrist to remember you are wearing it at all."
4,A good hop.,"I've owned this item for more than a month now - use it 2-3 times a week for exercise only (I'm 45 years old), not extreme tricks or jumping through flaming hoops. Had a pogo stick as a kid but not since. Unit is solid-feeling and springs are correct for my weight of 190 lbs. Unit works well and is fun exercise for me (it'll get me huffing and puffing quickly) - I'm sure to wear a helmet and pads just in case. So far this pogo stick is as advertised and has been a worthwhile purchase for me."
1,TRASH,"i bought this thinking it would be a fun thing to do at my college, little did i know it would break within the first minute if use... I'm 5'10"" 150 pounds well within the weight limit. one of the foot pegs completely broke off. i feel like this was a waste of money and want to know the return policy..."
3,The Joys of Feminism Through the Eyes of Tennyson,"""Alfred Lord Tennyson"" is a compilation by Marion Shaw of the feminist views within the poet's works. Marion Shaw deeply investigated the works of Alfred Lord Tennyson to discover the numerous feminist references the great poet used in his works to express his thoughts on gender equality. The book itself consists of 174 pages, including a chronological table of Tennyson, an alphabetical list of references, and an index. Shaw identifies such feminist views as marriage, romantic love, mothers, desire, and even death. She pinpoints each of these topics in Tennyson's writings and beautifully praises him."
2,kinda weak,"I'm not too familiar with ""Seam"", but this album is kinda weak. I don't know what the previous reviewer is talking about, there are a thousand other bands that sound just like this, only better. June of 44 is a good one to check out. You could pretty much put your hand in an indie hat and pick out 20 better bands with one scoop."
4,Good indie heavy metal,"This is the second album from the New Zealand band. They hit like a big truck two years with their first album. I saw them play live two years ago and couldn't believe it. They have a lot of talent and conviction bringing back exciting rock. The only problem is The Darkness. The Darkness seemed to come in last year and steal the thunder. The first Datsuns album was near perfect. Even with John Paul Jones on board, they would have pull off a miracle to better themselves. With songs like ""Blacken My Thumb"" and ""Messin' Around"" you would think they have answered the tall order. ""Messin' Around"" even seems like a song from the first album. While the album is pretty rocking it seems like they rushed it. The album loses focus halfway through and you are left scratching your head. Maybe live these songs are a hell of a lot better. The Datsuns can deliver onstage. They spent a lot of time on the road and maybe didn't have enough time to revolt against generic sounds."
3,Sophomore Slump,"If I haven't owned their self titled album already, I wouldn't be as disappointed with this release. There are only a few songs that come close to the level of rock on the self titled album. Blacken My Thumb and I Got No Words are the standouts of the CD and some of the middle tracks have the feeling of bland filler. If you have interest in the Datsuns, get their first album and wait for their next one to come out."
4,THis is the one !!,"AGENTS OF FORTUNE, alongside FIRE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN, are the quintessential BOC albums. You can forget about the rest. This band was always kind of ""disjointed"", ""disconnected"" or whatever. They never ever were really great. Go figure why...sometimes the same five musicians just can't deliver more than one or two great albuns. 1796's AGENTS of FORTUNE is a great rock album, ten good rock tunes."
2,Ben Jersey,This jersey was much cheaper quality than what I was expecting. I purchased a Brady Patriots Jersey for my boyfriend and it was much nicer. This one is see through with vinyl lettering. The patriots jersey had cloth lettering and much higher quality.
5,Excellent book on Africa!,"If you're thinking about a trip to Africa, this book is the best. David Anderson knows his stuff and I highly recommend this for anyone thinking about going on a Safari. Beautiful!!!!"
5,Teaching to Read with Ease,"Without any teaching knowledge, I was able to methodically teach my pre-school children how to read- and I had a blast singing along with them."
3,WKA's Review of Relax with Surf/Everglades/Pond,"I have owned a relax recording of this type for a good while and like it.The sounds of a pond are accompanied by ocarina music. Lovely.I imagined that Relax with Ocean Surf/Sounds of Everglades . . . would belike that, i.e., have music accompaniment. Only the ""Everglades"" CDhas music, and it is rather dull, droning music."
2,Not my kind of book,"What is so bad about people starting a business that mushrooms and has some control over an industry and the people it represents? This author had something against Jules Stein, Lew Wasserman, their wives, the employees, you name it-right from the beginning. And he is determined to prove I guess how awful they were and how big and corrupt their business is. I don't think there's any reason for a expose of MCA and the people who ran it. If it wasn't them it would have been someone. Plus, I do not like books that go on and on about politics in government OR within a company structure and I don't care about courtroom hassles and lawsuits. So this book wasn't really for me. I glossed over the majority of it and read the parts about the Wasserman's and Stein's and still wonder if they are as bad as he makes them. Doubtful."
3,I Was Wrong,Dear Jim: I was given your book by a patient of mine and felt oblidged to read it. Your book did a wonderful job of vindicating you and rightfully so. You were had! I am certain Jessica Hajn was a plant sent to destroy your ministry. And in fact you mention many other charismatic preachers who were defrocked as well as yourself. Without getting into any government consperacy here don't you think any of this was planned. But getting back to critiquing the book. Vindication was served well. But your book was also instrumental in casting a shadow on the whole charismatic movement. How does it look...a brother under Christ destroyed you and PTL? If a brother could be so vilainous and he's an influential brother what does that say for all of you? I Know the correct facts now thanks to your book.But you also must understand how many people such as myself will only further distance themselves from ever investigating your movement because of this book. I'm glad you're OK now. Be Well.
5,life changing-very real life,"jim bakker truly expresses remorse and teaches us all a life changing lesson of reality. brings home the importantance of putting your own life back into perspective, so you may help others in a genuine way"
5,The life changing story of Jim Bakker's journey.,"This was a book that just could not be put down. I was impressed by Jim Bakker's humble transformation while in prison. I cheered, jeered and cried. I wish all Born-Again Believers would read this."
4,Not their best but still KILLDOZER!!,"This band defies you to sit on the fence. You can't! Either you hate this band and their sludgy noisy music and their growling offtune frontman (97% of earth's population) or you think they are one of the most demonically expressive bands of the past quarter century (the remaining 3% OOHH! the 3% Nation of Noiselam!). Strange lyrics, hateful stuff. Good for the whole family? NO. But it's the family that I've always stood against... Yes it's the family that deserves to be tossed into the garbage bin of civilization.Killdozer reminds you of youth and power and and lust anger and venom. All the things that matter most in life."
5,Sock It To Me,"If you like Killdozer, one of the better bands of the last fifteen years, you will really like this album. If you like really heavy music with pounding drums and mean guitars and an evil man singing evil songs at you, then you will love God Hears The Pleas Of The Innocent.Porky's Dad and Spork are stuck in my head this week, but the whole album is thirty six of the best minutes to ever come out of Wisconson. No offense to Pachinko or Packer's fans."
5,A bulwark of strength,"I read this book while preparing for the Bar exams in 1998 in the Philippines. I want to pass it really bad, and Lewis Puller Jr.'s strength and wisdom is a bulwark of inspiration for me. I am now a lawyer, and his words stayed with me all these years.But it's so tragic. I'm dumbfounded knowing he killed himself! All this time, his remarkable story sustained me through my own struggles. He is a loser after all! How awful. I wish I hadn't read the reviews here that told me about the suicide!The writing is great anyway. But what a waste. I'm really disappointed!"
1,It doesn't work!,"Bought this cute pearl colored camera with much excitement and was highly disappointed that no matter how gently I pulled its rip cord, my film would simply not advance! I looked carefully inside and it really seems to be a design flaw. The teeth that feed the film sprockets just do not feed it effectively! Don't waste your money!"
2,From the minds of Minolta... on second thought... forget it.,"This was a cute little camera... at first. But I really didn't think the zooming in nor the zooming out was good at all while using the pictoral. It was hard to get the thing to focus properly. When using the video portion of the camera, the zoom in feature was great. But when you zoomed out, the distance would decrease significantly. We have had ours for about 3 years, and now it makes a little flicker of a beep when you try to turn it on, but it will not operate.If you're going to get a digital camera, make it a good one... stay away from this model."
1,Missleading promotion,"I bought this camera along with a 256 Mb SD viking card. There was a promotional code to disscount $25 bucks from total price, however amazon does not have the camera, it is sent by a third party seller and then you are charge the full price. Didn't expect this from amazon. Be aware."
4,"nice camera, but buy a case!","This camera looks really nice, takes good pictures, and is excellent value for money. On the downside, the little tune it plays when you turn it on is annoying, non-rechargeable batteries get used up very quickly (so buy rechargeable ones), and most significantly, it is very easy to mess up the camera if you get any dirt (or sand) into it's workings. I took mine to the beach once, didn't do anything particularly reckless, but a couple of grains of sand got in, and the zoom no longer works at all and the lens cover won't close.I would still recommend this camera, but just be careful with it..."
2,Better said than done,"I think that there was a good plot idea to work with here, but I felt as if this book did not live up to its potential. The characters' developments seemed superficial and held no interest for me. If Wagman continues to write, I doubt I'll be asking for another novel."
1,very disappointed,"Very Disappointed. I purchased as a Christmas present. It stopped working suddenly, we barely used it and its only mid January. The power plug burned out. Dont waste your time or your money. Not worth it."
4,My son loves it,Looks great. My son loves it.Keeps cans pretty cold - not quite as cold as a normal fridge.Makes a noise like a small fan running.
2,Take Me Out To The Ballpark,"A brief, interesting, informative survey of the history of ballparks from 18th century sandlots to the planned construction of AT&T Park. Although it is well-organized, it needs more depth. Ken Burns' ""Baseball: The Tenth Inning"", has a fascinating section with a Fenway Park tour guide. ""Ballparks"" could have benefited from that kind of approach, as well as more memorable photos, as in the ""Take Me Out To The Ballpark"" wall calendar. I also wanted to know more about HOK Sports and memorable moments in the various parks. It needed more. By the way, my disc had no closed captioning."
5,At last....,"This is a long overdue documentary. It's phenomenal in that it covers almost every aspect of addiction there is including the ER perspective and the challenges with health insurance.As a healthcare professional, I am frequently astounded by the response I receive when I ask patients what they have lost as a result of their addiction. While the responses range from jobs to cars and money, the room often becomes a lot quieter when the responses include children, families and identity. - This documentary hits on those difficult issues and several others which are present today and continue to present challenges for patients, families and healthcare providers. There is a long way to go - this documentary is a nice step forward."
5,HBO Addiction DVD,This is a well researched and beautifully presented documentary produced by HBO on the disease of addiction. It is a great tool for the chemical dependency student as well as a great tool for chemical dependency counselors for use in their educational groups.
3,addiction,"The 1.5 hr documentary itself is great. But all the extras get really repetitive, it feels like the documentary equivalent of 'bloatware'"
1,defective pump and service,"I was initially happy with this pump but within 2 months started having problems. The pump would not restart after cleaning the filter box in my pond without putting something in the pump to start the impeller moving again. Two weeks later the pump failed all together. Emails to Sunterra went unanswered until today, 10 months later with some lame excuse about having problems with their web site and just now getting my e-mail messages. The only help they offered was to see if I was still having problems with the pump even though what had happened was clearly explained in prior contact. In short this pump is junk and their customer service or lack of is highly suspect. I will make a point of steering clear of their products in the future."
4,polycom,"""the one thing I don't like is that you can't program Pauses into the speed-dial""As you program the number press the hold key to enter pauses.I gave up trying cordless 2 line speaker phones. They all had major problems. I like this phone except for the cord. It gets in the way of my PC's mouse."
2,Big disappointment,"bought two. returned both. first unit broke after two days of light use, and was completely non-functional. Second unit confirmed performance issues I had with the first before it broke, so it was returned as well.The speakerphone's full duplex action is not nearly as good as the marketing suggests. The microphone is rather weak, so my listeners tell me. The unit runs very hot all the time, which is a little worrisome. And even the handset doesn't give good voice transmission. i recorded a message with the handset and then listened to it, and it was mediocre quality. Sounded like I was on a headset, not the handset.Wish this thing was as good as it looked. Still looking for a true top of the line quality 2-line speakerphone without voice mail."
4,Excellent work from home phone,"I really love this phone. I bought a headset to go with it and it is just great. The speakerphone is the best I have ever used at home. I love the ability to switch from speakerphone to headset without the caller even knowing. The headset hanger is really cool and helps keep the desk tidy. The only complaint I have is that the speed dial can be a bit of a pain to use until you get used to it. Your top 10 numbers are super easy. The rest, you have to scroll through the list, not always an easy thing, as the LCD is not easy to read unless you are right on top of the phone. Yeah, the headset is warm, but I have only used it once to see what it was like. :-)"
3,Remastered?,"Columbia, which spit out some terrible CDS in the early days of digital sound, has remastered some of its 70s recordings with success, but this isn't one of them. The original LP of ""Silk Degrees"" was compressed and short on the bass end. The remastering sounds equally bad: the sound is thick, unlayed, lacking separation and ""air"". It makes you wonder if the master tape was lost or damaged and all that's left in the vault is an awful, equalized dub. Compare the sound of the studio recording from 1975 with the live ones from a year later. Great music but this disc is sad."
4,The Secret weapn behind this wonderful album...,"...""Love Me Tomorrow"". There are so many addicting grooves on this record but, man, I don't think I've ever heard blue-eyed soul reggae like ""Love Me Tomorrow""."
3,"Okay - okay, I gave in to peer pressure.","I've downloaded my entire cd collection on my I Pod. Problem is, when I play it at social gatherings, someone always asks for tunes from this album. After much contemplation, I purchased it to add to my collection. After listening to it, it's not that bad though I prefer his earlier recordings."
2,Not good for young children,"Too much emphasis was put on the birth mother. Although I am greatful for birth mothers, adoption books should be about the child and his/her needs over the needs of the birth mother. It was recommended by an adoption group and we read it to our 5 year old. He cried for a long time afterwards because he could not understand why the baby could not be with his mother. I threw it away and will not recommend it to anyone for kids under 10."
3,Covers,"apartment and land investments. Go figure. I guess they wanted to cover a cash-flow investment and a speculative investment. Authors do a good job explaining the numbers. Very graph oriented. Book is chock full of graphs and charts in relation to the numbers. Chapter on dealing with tenants, negotiating, forms of ownership and one on financing.Investing in land as a speculative investment is rarely for beginners(land is a cash drain) as most real estate investors are looking for cash either from flow or profit from a quick flip. So if you want info on both for some reason, check this book out."
5,Marcel Pagnol and Fernandel--like peaches & cream,"I picked up a used copy of the book, which I thought was a play until I realized it was more of a screenplay. A few scenes are cut from the text of the play and some of the best ones are shortened, and there's new dialogue in the film in parts. Absolutely fabulous. Does anyone know how to find a VHS or DVD of ""La Fille du Puisatier"", another Pagnol film? I'm about to start reading a copy of that play. If you do know, comment on this review please."
3,"Really not bad, though not so well-known...","This is definitely a good album for people who like the Swedish sound, but also like those industrial/techno overtones that ring true with bands like Dark Tranquillity (on Haven and Projector, anyway), ...And Oceans, Tristania and several others. The vocals sound a lot like Angela Gossow of Arch Enemy, though it's a guy...meaning to say that they're a bit more towards the higher-toned growling. Musically, it's not bad at all, and I love having it pop up in my mixes. It's heavier than it is fast, but it's not slow by any means. The last song is a full-on industrial-styled instrumental, and the same type of stuff is layered throughout. It's not the best album anywhere by anyone...but it's certainly good, has extended listenability and is fairly unique in its own right. If they allowed a 3.5 star rating, I'd give it that, to be honest..."
5,Best software book I've read in a few years,"This is a very thoughtful, considered book about enterprise programming with Java / J2EE and some of the consequences of following the textbook / blueprint approach. I find that the subjects where I have prior experience with he is confirming or structuring stuff I have seen and in the areas that I have no experience I really trust his observations. He details the different J2EE approaches and analyses their strengths and weaknesses.If you like Martin Fowler's books or the pragmatic writings of Andy Hunt & Dave Thomas then you should love this."
4,Good product but...,I bought a wahl pro series clipper and after the stained blade it was very difficult to me to find a exact fitting replacement blade.Finally I found it but I found it difficult to install as the shape of the internal blade is different from the original... and the price I think it's quite high
4,Tune that thing!,"The piano, that is. Who records an artist like Jaki Byard playing an out-of-tune instrument?"
5,U2 - The Best of 1990-2000,"I bought this CD for my husband as he loves the song, A Beautiful Day, and after listening to it I love it too. All the songs are great and we never tire of listening to them. The Amazon price for this CD was very reasonable and the shipping was fast to Australia."
4,Good but not the best,I enjoyed this cd but not as much as the best of 1980-1990. Still great music from u2!
4,A book of fantasy that makes you think,"This is a neat book; it opens up the imagination to a fascinating scenario. It was unusual for me to NOT identify with the main character, but with the other people who made the choice. I think I would, too. Wilson is a great writer; I've read most of his works and this is one of my faves."
4,A Good One- If you can find it,"Like RCW's more recent ""The Chronoliths"", ""The Harvest"" explores how regular people deal with cataclismic changes to planet Earth, this time in the form of first contact with aliens.The purpose of the alien visitation is left a little unclear; are they truly benevolent in offering humanity eternal life? Or is it a bait-and-switch, a 'harvesting' of all intelligent life on Earth? Wilson rightly avoids giving us all the answers, leaving higher meanings to the imagination of the reader. Well done.Wilson has many strengths as a writer, all of which are on display here: Very realistic characters, some clever ideas, low sentimentality and avoidance of smarmy cliches, and finally, an intelligent yet quick writing style. I plowed through this book.I especially liked the way the aliens made contact with us humans. It's not what you would expect, but it is very easy to believe.If you like the more recent Wilson books, this one is worth tracking down."
5,Secular Rapture?,"I loved this book. A kind of ""Childhood's End"" and secularized Christian Rapture rolled into one. The author writes like Wyndham or Wells, in that the narrator is part of the action but also dispassionately observing the flow. The protagonist of course wishes to have none of it. While everyone has answered the Big Question of immortality in the affirmative, he is skeptical of apotheosis and throws in his lot on the side of his own mortality. In the end, immortality is at a price, assimilation. The book casts a spell of mystery over the reader in that the aliens and their purpose is never revealed. One wonders if our species is really gullable to the point that any confidence artist coming down the celestial highway pedaling immortality in the form of the savior would make us sell our souls for it. Is the novel a satire then of our moral turpitude or a call to existential redemption? I wish the author would give us more wonderful stories."
3,Expected different,"I was slightly disappointed by this book. I expected more realistic arrangements with flare that might help those on a tight budget. The pictures however were extrodinary and they did help in my choices as to what flower photgraphs well. If you are planning an outdoor wedding with a big budget. . .this book is for you. For those of you like me, on a tight budget and an indoor wedding, I wouldn't recommend this particular book."
2,Quite Disappointed!,"Contrary to the one other reviewer of this book, I was very dissappointed. I want a traditional wedding with a flare. This book shows very out of the ordinary flower ideas that everyday people will not and cannot use. However, the book does show a few nice 'flowers in your hair' ideas, but for the price of this un-inspiring book, it is Not worth it. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,This book has something for everyone!,"This book has a variety of afghan patterns for every skill level. This book is a special part of my collection because I used a pattern from this book called ""White Lace"" to crochet a very special afghan for my little girl. I didn't crochet it in white though since my favorite color is purple. I crocheted it in a very unusual purple yarn that I received as a gift from a dear friend (which made it even more special). I also love the pattern called ""Lacy Shells"". It is a great pattern for the beginning crocheter since the entire pattern only has 3 rows and row 3 is repeated until desired length."
2,Not a great album,"Hey, this ain't that great an album. I have other Pogue CDs that are really enjoyable and I like some of the songs on this album, but c'mon. The tunes aren't that memorable and the best songs ('A man you don't meet every day', 'Navigator') are too few.I really like the Pogues. Songs like 'Sunny Side of the Street' and 'If I Should Fall From Grace of God' are great! I'm a big fan of 'Irish Bar Music' but this album just didn't cut if for me."
1,Trash,"Trash. It is amazing how many people gave this anime a high review. It's trashy fanservice. The whole show is a setup for it. It is everything wrong with shows in Japan- more and more crap like this is coming out and because people like those who gave this a 4 or 5 stars keep giving it, well, 4 or 5 stars. If you want to watch naked boobs, big boobs, panties, there are a lot of websites out there you can jack it to. For god sakes, if you want toons with boobs and hot girls, Japan makes that too, it's called hentai. Leave porn to porn and tv shows to tv shows. Nothing against a little fanservice as long as the show doesn't go out of its way for it. This though, is ridiculous. Its entire plot is based around fanservice."
3,Not too bad,"This is a very typical zombie story. There's not much to tell. It's very well animated though. I liked the characters and the voices. There is plenty of gore and enough comedy to make you laugh out loud once in a while. H.O.T.D. is no masterpiece, but it's not too bad either. It's worth $15 I'd say. If you want to watch a great horror anime, watch Shiki. Shiki is amazing."
5,I liked It,"I like to consider myself a big zombie fan, and I also really really like anime. This one actually made me lift my legs from the couch!It had action, laughs, and started out great. Wish they could of made another installment since it feels like there's a part 2, but nevertheless, Im glad I purchased it!"
3,High school of the dead,This anime was ok. It had good idea for a story. It jump around a lot and i did not like it. I don;t know what going half a time.I don;t know if it has missing episode or not. But I can say it has some hot girls. I do not know if they ever get ride of the undead.
5,OMG!!!,"I normally do NOT like zombie stuff. However, this series is awesome! there is a killer story line behind all the blood and guts that makes it perfect for either gender. Totally worth you money to add this to your collection."
5,Yum!,"I bought these to go with a Lego City police cruiser cake I made for my son's 10th birthday (I placed some randomly around the cake on the board.) These were a big hit with everyone. The kids were able to build with them, and we all loved the taste (like Sweet Tarts!) I may by more for Christmas stocking stuffers."
5,5 stars is not enough!!!,"This is the greatest book I have ever read! It may be long but it goes so fast. I cant wait to get on to the other books in the Asian Saga. Get off your butt, turn off the computer and all other electronic things, buy this amazing book and be prepared to lose a whole lot of sleep over this amazing book by an amazing author."
4,Not quite so bad... but not excellent,"Jimmy wrote a pretty gripping novel, and it should be enjoyed for what it is. Criticisms of his Japanese grammar inconsistencies are well-put, but criticisms of ""Historical innaccuracy"" seem misplaced when one considers this is a work of fiction. Sure, Toranaga is really Tokugawa, and Blackthorne Will Adams, but these are just the people on whom Clavell was trying to base his fictional characters.Don't expect to learn a great deal about the Japanese people (I have yet to urinate with someone) from this book... especially Japanese people of today. However, those who happen to know what ""Japanese"" people are like shouldn't take umbrage at the way people were in the late 16th-early 17th century. Of course Japan is ""mystical"" through the eyes of the English Blackthorne, he'd never heard of regular bathing before washing ashore.A good book and a fun read... Go for it, it will make you cool."
2,Payoff not worth the length,"Shogun was very entertaining up until about the last 100 pages, when it became apparent that there weren't enough pages left for the story to resolve in a satisfactory way. Plot lines that went on for hundreds of pages were either lost or resolved in a paragraph or two. The ending was terrible and anti-climatic. Overall, it was a fun read until the end but I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't like long books. It's just not worth the time and effort."
3,Good but no that good (3.5 *),"When I first read Shogun i thought it was fantastic, a work of art and the best book ever written etc, etc; However reading it again at a slightly older age i was dissapointed. Whilst it is a good story, if you are into epics, it's not utterly fantastic, a lot of the subtlety is pseudo and if we're honest the writing isn't up to the standard of Dickens (but then who is) as such it can't be a five star!! Five should be reserved for truly great works masterpieces that set the world alight, and this just isn't. It is not so much what is lacking,it is a very good book with plenty of depth but to be a classic a book requires that touch of genius that sets's it apart and this is something that Shogun (and indeed Clavell) just doesn't possess."
2,Drawn out predictability,"However well written, it felt like a chore reading through the book, rather than an enjoyment. It wasn't bad, but the story could have been told in 1/2 the pages."
5,Curl up with a good book,"When I first looked at this book its length caused me to put it down. Then a good friend of mine told me to ""read the first two chapters."" I did. I was hooked.Sho-Gun is a book that gave me good reason to finish work and get back home and read; I would read late into the night until I was finished. It's a captivating story about politics, people, relationships, history and cultural and religious clashes at their best.I have recommended this book to several avid readers. Each one has thanked me for the recommendation. Need I say more?"
5,"If you like Historical Fiction and different cultures, this is your book","Don't let the length of the book deter you from reading it. I was highly engrossed in this novel, loving learning the culture and language, history, and courageousness of the characters of this book. It made me want to go visit Japan and experience it for myself."
5,Great Book,"I'm not a fiction fan, but this book was incredibly compelling and informative about Japanese history and culture. This is a true masterpiece."
4,A rip-snorter of a page turner,"Loved this book when I read it years ago, loved it again upon re-reading. I'd forgotten many of the details, so Clavell's rich tapestry of 18th Century Japan was a joy to read again."
2,bogged down with war politics,"I was riveted by the first third of this book but felt bogged down with war politics in the later parts of the book. This prevented me personally from rating it as excellent however, anyone interested in war strategy and especially ancient Japanesse war strategy should love this book."
2,Samurai,"I bought this book thinking it would be about the honorable warriors of fuedel Japan. Alas, i was let down, it was more of a love storie than about battles. I didn't like the book very much. But im 13 and I may not have fully understood its signifigance."
2,Why Did She Omit her 1981 Marriage?,"Liked ""Devotion"" so much that I read her first supposedly true story, ""Slow Motion.""As a reviewer here already pointed out, the idea that her friend's rich super lawyer/lying stepfather took advantage of her innocence, that the only other guy she dated was a college boy who felt her up, is ludicrous. She was married, albeit briefly, to the guy who founded Putmayo. [....]Hmmm...."
1,Worst movie ever?,"I love Jess Franco's work, even the low-budget late career efforts. But ""Red Silk"" - a revisiting of two female sleuths from late 60's films ""Two Undercover Angels"" and ""Kiss Me Monster"" - suffers from bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad acting, bad sound, bad....everything. One of the ten worst movies I've ever seen."

1,Poor Quality!!!,"I hear hissing from the speaker! It's easy to notice the hissy speaker at night when it's quiet. I thought it might be a defected phone because I like the quality of Ploycom phone (sound station) at work. Then, I went to exchange for another one which has same problem but the hissing volume was lower than the previous one. In addition, I can hear myself from the handset earpiece. I was totally disappointed and disatisfied."
3,Why so highly rated?,"I bought this book for my grandson, age 3 1/2, based on readers' recommendations. He loves books and enjoys even long books like ""Mike Mulligan"" and ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"". He has a great imagination. Books he likes, he ""reads"" repeatedly. This book got read once and then was ignored. No questions; no comments other than ""Let's read a different book"". Why would anyone write a book about issuing ultimatums or even use the word in a pre-school book? I think adults will find this more amusing than children."
5,The Funny Farm,"Farmer Brown has a problem. His cows like to type. He hears, ""Click, Clack, Moo"" every day. The cows wrote: ""Dear Farmer Brown, At night the barn is cold. So we all need blankets. Love, Your Farm Animals."" Later on, there were no blankets. ""No Blankets!"" said the cows. Later there was a note for the farmer. ""Sorry,"" it said. ""No milk or eggs today."" The farmer got out his typewriter and wrote a note. It said, ""Dear Cows and hens, I demand milk and eggs."" The duck asked if he could borrow the typewriter. The cows said, ""Yes."" Duck wrote, ""Dear Farmer Brown, the pond is quite boring. Can we have a diving board?"" The farmer said, ""Yes."" If you like farm animals you will like this book...William Z."
5,baby's first subversive book,"Doreen Cronin has penned a little masterpiece here and, oh, does Farmer Brown have a problem!This is a book that can be enjoyed at many age levels. Young children will appreciate the absurdity of farm animals typing, and older kids and adults will enjoy the progressive message of farm animals' collective bargaining. I am making a gift of this book to children *and* adults I know. Fun illustrations are brush drawings with watercolor washes, and feature cows, chickens, a (neutral) duck and a rather distraught farmer.Our two-year-old runs around the house saying ""click clack moo"". Just wonderful."
5,My Son's Favorite,"I bought this book based on the recommendation of a friend. I have never been sorry! This book is one of my son's favorite--he is always begging me to read ""Moo, Mommie, Moo!"". Considering it has been his favorite for months and he is not yet two, the age recommendation is not necessarily accurate. Children of all ages will love this book for a long time! Between this and the sequel, ""Click, Clack, Quack!"", my son has also learned many of the animals sounds. I highly recommend buying both for hours of entertainment!"
1,This phone is terrible.,"I thought this phone would be an ok phone because I've had good AT&T phones in the past. I was wrong with this one. The biggest problem I have found is that no hands free headset works well with it. They are all too quiet for hearing and speaking. People on the other end can never hear you when you use one. I've looked around and can't find one that works with the phone. I try the headset in a different phone i have and they work fine. Also this phone can get staticy. At random times, I will get a bunch of noise while talking. I would recommend something else."
2,Deadheads,"Dirty Three are in essence the Grateful Dead, squashed down to a trio. The formula is the same: modal jamming on a simple riff, build to a climax, and let it die out. Occasionally I think the band stumbles into some good moods, but this is quite pedestrian music-making: Warren Ellis' intonation is, frankly, atrocious, and don't dare tell me that he's playing out of tune on purpose a la Ornette Coleman. He is incapable of playing an extended line in tune. The other two aren't bad, but without someone playing in the bass range, they lack bottom, and as a result, lack punch when they really need it. Not truly bad, but nothing to write home about."
5,ECRanchreview,The La Crosse Digital Walll Clock I ordered (WS-8157U) is excellent. It arrived safely and in good time. Their customer service was very helpful in getting the clock regulated.
4,Smooth transition from bubblegum pop to disco & funk,"The Jackson family took an important step forward with this album, which trades on their early 70s style for the emerging disco & funk. Michael's voice has matured more at this point, and on songs which he sings lead, he pretty much sounds like he would a few years later in his brilliant solo career. He really lets it all out on ""Show You The Way To Go"" (arguably one of the best songs of the ""Jacksons"" period), and is also good on the hit ""Enjoy Yourself"". The disco-ish ""Think Happy"" is also good."
3,ITEM WAS NEVER DELIVERED. CANCEL AND RECEIVED MONEY BACK.,"I NEVER RECEIVED MY ITEM, THE COMPANY WAS GREAT IN RETURNING MY MONEY IN MY ACOUNT, IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE MAIL.."
2,Slow moving; littered with cardboard characters,"This book was a major disappointment but,fortunately, I got it from the library so I only lost a little time. The characters were without dimension, shallow and not the sort one could identify with. I finally got to the point where I could not put up with these people at the snail's pace of the plot. Maybe I gave up too soon; maybe not."
2,"Good ideas, but disappointing, too buggy","I'm a big fan of the Civilization series -- I think Civ II is maybe the best PC game of all time. Many of the features in Civ III are appealing, and after a bit of mindset adjustment, are actually quite fun.The problem: bugs. Even at patch v1.29f (the last one offered before the Conquests expansion), I have yet to play through an entire game without running into some kind of computer-move hang, or game crash, or SOMETHING that completely obviates the substantial amount of time you've put into a particular game. Seeing two days of gameplay go up in smoke because an important strategic resource appears NOWHERE on the entire map is not fun.I'm not too eager to plop down another $20-30 to get an expansion for a game I can't play in the first place, so I guess I'm out of luck. My recommendation is to save your money, and cherish the memories of the earlier installments of the franchise."
4,good old stuff!!,I like old 'hippie' music and J.A. is one of my favorites.This record gives you the best of Airplane thats for sure.For someone taking of with the Jeffersons Airplane first time: this is the record to buy!The awesome voice of Grace Slick is cutting you to pieces!Goood buy!
5,The Great Bob Dylan,It is Bob Dylan the greatest poet of my time anything he writes and sings about is great.If you want to know about God listen to Bob Dylan? He tells it like it is and is not afraidof what people think. He is my hero.
3,Not what I expected.,"Okay Dylan album. If your hard core you would want it, if not stick to the basic Dylan stuff."
2,Spotty,"Obviously you're looking at this disc because you are a Peter Green fan. Disc One is Peter Green solo from his ""mid"" period. It's not bad but you would be better served by ""In the Skies"" or even ""Little Dreamer"". Disc 2 is all Fleetwood Mac live stuff. At first glance it seems interesting as some of the song titles are unfamiliar. However, the sound quality is so poor it's unlistenable."
4,Great album!,This is one great early TD albums. Bright and melodic. If you like TD you can check out mind voyage campaign on kickstarter too and to sponsor a new comer in electronic music.
2,Tangerine boys can't compose music,The most important works of Tangerine Dream were made early 70s. Those albums could be called 'ambient'. But now they are trying to make melodical stuff and we can see that they can't compose at all. Themes on this album are too simple to entertain me. Also a sonic palette has nothing imaginative despite of synthesizer arsenal that is used. This is perhaps suitale for boring and unimaginative people.
5,smooth as silk,Everything went so smoothly!!! It was only a day or two between placing my order & receiving the book. Kudos to all. HAven't read this particular book yet 0 it's in the stack...but Hillerman rocks & I'm crazy about Leaphorn (poor thing) and JImmy Chee.
2,Lacking,This book was lacking in many ways. Construction Drawings and Details for Interiors: Basic Skills by Rosemary Kilmer was a much better book on space planning and graphics for much less than this book.
2,The clock is a fake,"This is not a real grandfather's clock. It uses batteries and cheap sounding electronic bell sounds. The weights are fake. The clock is just a basic battery powered clock in the box of a prefab shell. From a distance it looks nice. If you want a real grand father's clock go elsewhere. If the price is too good to be true, it probably is and this is a good example. I wish I had got the real thing."
3,Handset won't pick up clear signal 40 feet away,haven't tried the call waiting and the answering machine part works ok but if your not within 20 feet of the base with the handset you get (out of service) or if it does connect you get staticthe booklet with it tells you to move away from appliances etc to get a clear signalIf I wanted to get up to go answer the phone I wouldn't want a cordless one geez
1,Horrible,"The phones worked fine for about a year. Then the battery in one phone stopped holding a charge. No problem, $12.00 at the battery store. Fixed. Then 2 months later one of the phones stopped working all together. Tried 2 battery replacements. Now 4/2/04 the other phone is not working at all either and they are out of warranty. For $100+ a phone system should last longer than 2 years. We are switching back to the 1990 model we had before. It still works fine."
2,Headset problems,"Purchased ... 2 months ago; now there is a constant problem with using the headset. Static, no one can hear me, interrupts conversation so callers can't hear others on conference calls.I'm very disappointed; wish I'd read the tips to save receipts and packing materials before I'd purchased. Threw it all away, and this phone will follow soon!!!"
1,Worst Phone Ever Bought!,I researched online the various phones on the market and thought I had bought one of the better phones. Was I wrong! I am taking it back after one week! When talking on either handset - all I hear is my voice sounding like I am on a speakerphone. There is no way to change channels to correct this. The answering machine is difficult to program and sounds like the message was recorded on a boom box. Will not purchase an AT&T phone again!!!
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,This is the worst phone I have ever owned. Neither handset holds a charge for more than 5 minutes. We have missed critical phone calls due to the phone being on the charger and STILL not ringing. Target refuses to refund our money saying they do not sell this phone but today it is on the HOT list online. Go figure-I guess I should take back the thousands of dollars I have spent at Target and take my money somewhere else.
2,waste of money,"The clarity of both the handsets and the answering machine is awful. After putting up with this system for nearly a year, the only positive comment I can offer is that it promotes family time as we all gather around, straining to decipher the recorded messages."
1,Phone has an echo,"I bought this phone after returning a Panasonic with the same features and an extra handset also. I returned the panasonic because it had an echo, and i couldnt cradle it between my ear and shoulder without pressing any buttons with my face. I bought this at&t phone because It seemed to cradle between my ear and shoulder fine and has all the features i want, but it also has an echo that is unacceptable. I am not sure if it is the 2.4 models or maybe has to do with the extra hand set. ANNOYING"
4,We like this phone.,"We've owned this phone for a few months and it works well. The battery life hasn't been an issue for us because we usually put the phone back in its charger when we're done. It has been very durable. My Wife is a ""butter-fingers"" (she'll be the first to admit it) and so this phone gets dropped every day or two onto a tile floor and so far it keeps working. It has lasted longer than any cordless phone we have used. The sound quality is very good. The only thing I find fault with is that the answering machine keeps recording for a minute or so after the caller hangs up."
4,Atomic time travel alarm,"I didn't give this a five-star rating because of how it loses it's signal from the transmitter in Colorado if the clock isn't placed near a window actually facing Colorado. Once the clock is placed in said window, it gets the signal back within 2-24 hours or so and displays the exact time once again."
2,Digital Travel Alarm Clock,After 6 months the digits on the clock started disappearing. Initially I thought it could be because of weak battery but even after changing the battery no improvement.
2,Rich and Famous Black Wood Frame - Not,"Given the description of this item, I was very excited to give it as a Christmas gift. To my dismay, when the box was opened, it was nothing like I expected. The frame was very poor quality. It looked as if they had picked it up at a yard sale and spray-painted it black. No, it was not intentionally distressed, it was cheap! The ""hooks"" were merely taped on the cardboard backing. Don't waste your money... if you like the print, buy it and frame it yourself!"
1,Don't waste your money on these!,"These are way too bulky to put in you shoes/boots. I have had the Toasty toes in the past and loved them but I decided to try these this time because they were cheaper. What a waste of money because I now have to go back and buy the good ones. The toasty toes are thin & adhesive so they are easy to place and fit great in your shoes. These are packets that you just put in your shoe and no matter where you place it, it hurts to walk. They are bulky and extremely uncomfortable. Pay the extra and get the good ones!"
5,A true delight!,"While I liked Ms. Cook's first novel, Unlaced, I believe I enjoyed this one even more! Unveiled is a charming and emotional love story with two lead characters who truly make you empathize with them. Hayden and Jane are obviously made for each other, and watching them fight their feelings--and each other--only makes the moment when they finally admit their love all the sweeter. A page-turning read!"
3,"""Play that Funky Music"" will live on forever","All you need is one great song to be remembered for the rest of your life.""Play that Funky Music"" has been played on TV commercials,a top 10 hit for Vanilla Ice,and Craig Kilborn's late night theme song.Wild Cherry is from my hometown,and were very proud of them,along with Dean Martin,and Traci Lords.This one record has made the writer of this song,Rob Perrish,very rich.There was alot of great bands from my area growing up,""Wam"" was my favorite,but Wild Cherry was the only group to have a number 1 hit."
1,in answer to Mandy,"The Song 'play that Funky Music' was written by the founder of the group, and lead guitarist Robert Parissi. Other members of the band included Mark Avsec, Bryan Bassett, Ron Beitle, Wil Masisak,& Allen Wentz. Take from that what you will. I personally like this album, it's what you expect from this time period, and 'play that funky music' will always be a dance staple."
4,Good Book...but maybe don't bother if you are a total beginner,"Although I give this book 4 stars, to be honest it did not help me at all. I was hoping to be able to make my own chairs but apparently lack the skills that are necessary...and the patience. I would say if you are a beginning wood worker like myself that this may not be the right book for you. That said, the book seems like to someone with the right skill set it would be very helpful. The directions seem to be pretty clear, but that doesn't change the fact that chair making is complicated!!! This book is staying on my shelf until hopefully some day I can pick it back up and actually make a darn chair. If nothing else this book made the chairs that I bought seem like a bargain, considering all of the work that goes into them!"
5,Best I've read in a while,"I have enjoyed Marie Bostwick's more recent books, and decided to see what else might be available. So glad I did! This was a wonderful book, with a unique and unpredictable story. I'm going to purchase another copy to loan to friends."
4,New York Living,"This book offers a fascinating glimpse of the private world of many New Yorkers. The photography of the various homes and lifestyles, is exquisitely detailed. The anonymity of the streets of the Big Apple is juxtaposed with views of these personal, creative interiors."
4,Massive Summary of Christian Truths,"I am a begginer, 22 years old, in the field of christianity. I've been a believer for 4 years now, but up until recently I am developing interest in a more profound study of Christian Faith.This book looks quite tempting to read on... but, from my perspective, its surely not an easy read; its dense and surely profound. To be sincere, its too philosophycal for my taste and lacks more day-to-day ilustrations that could make the reading more pleasant and easy to remember.I don't under estimate the scope and richness of St.Thomas, but for begginers I recomend trying C.S. Lewis Mere Christianity.God Bless!"
1,i never got the download,i ordered this album for mp3 download well i never got it said i needed to download the cloud so i did still never got the download so now im out nine bucks and amazon got richer that sucks hard
5,Milky Way Marmalade Rocks!!,"You have to love any book that starts out with this as its first line...""The universe, I once noted, is not only stranger than you can imagine, it secretly dresses in studded-leather feetie pajamas and spiked fuchsia pasties."" ""Milky Way Marmalade"" is a sweet treat, that will make you smile, wonder, and laugh out loud. It's filled with wacky characters with strange names and a very human hero named Caffrey Quark. After reading this tale, you will never look at a West Highland White Terrier in the same way.Congratulations Mike DiCerto on a job well done. A hilarious story with very serious undertones. Who knew that rock music would one day save the universe? This is a wonderful book by a very talented author. When is the next book coming out? I didn't want this one to end."
5,Tubby the Tuba,I remember this book from my brothers childhood. My grandson 3 1/2 year old grandson is into musical instruments and especially the tuba. The companion CD is wonderful for the times when he wants to read it himself.
5,LOVE this book and CD!,"My 2 year old grandchild loves this book/CD, and so do I. It has a darling story about feeling out of place, the importance of friends, (i.e./frog), and overcoming the negative aspects of ones life. The CD is a great addition, and perfect for an introduction to music and musical instruments. Our next 'day-trip' is to a music store to explore all the beautiful musical instruments!"
5,WHOLESOME VIEWING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!,"I watched this beloved series in the 70's as a teenager. It was such a JOY to be able to purchase it on Amazon and have it arrive in my mail. I have watched most of Season One so far and it has brought back fond memories of what GOOD TELEVISION was and should be. If you want a heartwarming gift of great TV with Biblical references and values, please consider purchasing this set for yourself and family. I am 54 and enjoy it as much today as I did over 30 years ago. Thank you Amazon for offering this. I received it in a timely manner and got free shipping too! A great investment for wholesome viewing for the entire family and a legacy for your kids and grandkids for years to come! Teaches wholesome values that all of us and especially children should have."
2,Not happy,This is the first time I have ever bothered to write a review although I feel that it is necessary to save other people some grief. I got this camera for 1/2 off at a going out of business sale and I regret even that! One reviewer had said that the lag time is awful. I couldn't agree more! We took it whale watching on our vacation to Boston. I now have pleanty of dark pictures of the very end of the whale and also many of the water splash the whales leave. What a let down!
1,guilbaud,"My son was unable to play the game because the key code DID NOT work. The retailer wants to charge a restocking fee, as this was our problem...will NEVER order anything again from this retailer."
4,A well written book on a little known facet of Battletech.,"This Boxed set is rather interesting and bring up a fact of the Battletech Galaxy that is rarely considered. The only problem is that in the Battletech Galaxy there are very few warships and not that many dropships. Thus, any damage or loss will SIGNIFICANTLY alter the time line. There is also a lack of detail in this set. Everything is done in a gargantuan scale to allow for speed of play. All in all the only glaring flaw I have seem is a lack of willing opponents."
2,Book,Boring.. Was not really a story . A lot of repeat . Disappointed. Could have got history book free from library.
2,"Great Tracks, but a Great Blues Song Left Out","How can they put out a soundtrack to this great movie without including ""Turning Point"" as sung by Mighty Joe Young in what I think is the infamous Wise Fools Pub on North Lincoln Ave. in Chiacgo? I still have and listen to the original vinyl ""soundtrack."" Skip this expensive CD version because of its incompleteness, even though the tracks by Tangerine Dream are fantastic."
3,looks good,This looks good but the nonstick part seems thicker than it should be and makes it harder to turn things. I bought another spatula from the same company. It is all stainless with silicone just across the turning edge and I like it much better.
3,More Fun For Hardcore Genesis Fans,"A companion to Volume 1, this volume offers more of the same (see previous review). Highlights are hard to find, but the early promo for the classic Hackett-era Ripples is a fan favorite, as well as the corny studio romp of A Trick of the Tail. Invisible Touch and Throwing It All Away both appear from 1986's multi-platinum crossover smash, and live performance clips (usually synced to the studio tracks) of Home By the Sea/Second Home By the Sea, Man on the Corner, and Turn It On Again will please fans of the early 80's albums. Also includes Misunderstanding, Keep It Dark, and the Collins ballad Many Too Many from 1978. Out of print, but easy to obtain on the tape-trading grapevine. Now, if only they would release the promo videos from the Collins-less return to form Calling All Stations album! If you love Genesis and haven't heard this album, rush out and buy it today - it's my favorite Genesis since Seconds Out.Mikel in Seattle"
3,"Loved the writing, didn't care for the characters","Wow! I wonder why I've never read any of F. Scott Fitzgerald's works before. This short book was tremendously well written, with wonderful imagery and amazing use of language. The text conjures up clear images of the period, and you can almost taste the dust, feel the heat, and hear the sounds of the settings described. While I found the characters to be largely unsympathetic and much too self-absorbed, I still found myself facinated with the story and unable to put the book down. What a wonderful reflection of an age and society that has long since disappeared."
4,Great Book,"This book agrandized our lives after completing this masterpiece. At first, the book was slow, but after it picked up momentum, it never slowed. F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of the most coveted authors in all american literature. He is a mastermind in all of art's history. He uses ordinary situations and makes them come to life."
4,Helpful Guide,"I have found this book to be an informative helpful guide about some of the Carribean islands which little seems to be written.It is particularly useful for someone, like myself, who is ready to explore the Carribean beyond their own favorite island, in my case - St. John.I am finding it to be a great resource tool.A minor fault - I wish it had more colored pictures."
3,"Ok, I'm being generous","THIS GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE. As a Vietnam war historian and fan of the movie, I will say that the military history behind this game is atrocious. Whomever came up with the characters had to have been reading from the glossary of some military novel without looking up what the people and places actually were.I've had this game for years and it is frustrating as hell. Nevertheless I keep coming back to it. I enjoy the challenge. Unlike an FPS, you really do need to put some degree of tactical skill into this such as fire and maneuver, cover and concealment. Does it irritate me that they don't shoot when they see the enemy. Yes...but all I want is to get to the levels where I can use the APC's and tanks..."
5,thanks Beth Zeller (miller now),"I just remember listening to this album in the fall of 1978 at Benedictine College as a stupid naive freshman. To this day it brings back memories of youth and first ""like."" Thanks to Beth who still to this day remains one of my dearest friends. And thank you Dan Fogelberg"
2,Doesn't hold up,"I was in college when Fogelberg was hitting his stride with this album. I accumulated three or four of his albums and enjoyed them with my friends. Then they were buried in my record collection for decades.Recently I pulled them out during my project to digitize all my LPs. Man, was I surprised. I was frankly amazed that I listened to Fogelberg back in the day. Today it sounds like a bunch of sappy, maudlin, over-produced fluff. I found his high-pitched voiced annoying. Unlike almost anything I listened to back in the 70s and 80s (and I listened to huge variety of music) Fogelberg just doesn't stand the test of time.As I came to a greater singer/songwriter, James Taylor, I was afraid I'd feel the same way -- but I didn't. A few of Taylor's songs don't hold, but as a body of work Taylor's career is as solid as it ever was. I can't say the same for our dear, departed Mr. Fogelberg."
5,College Memories,This was my favorite album in college. It brings back great memories. I saw him in concert and fell in love!
4,"Not much of a Mardi Gras, but definately worth seeing","I was skeptical of this movie at first. I was used to seeing Robert Davi as Bailey Malone from Profiler and was most familiar with his portrayal of villians, but I was impressed. The movie pits Robert Davi as a homicide detective up against the Devil. Most people didn't like the ending, but I think it was very ironic and, from a theological perspective, quite accurate."
2,Bad quality on answering machine messages,"I bought this phone to replace my six year old Panasonic digital machine/phone combo that had begun to act flaky. I hoped that I would also get better sound quality with messages since computer memory and processing power have gotten much cheaper since 1998. Unfortunately the messages on this machine are worse than my old Panasonic, which weren't great to begin with. I also was annoyed by the feature that plays back the date, time, number of messages, etc. before it will play your messages: my old phone does this but the AT&T speaks v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y so you have to wait until it finishes its spiel before you can hear your messages (even if it's an old message). The sound quality of phone calls themselves are fine. I didn't try any other features because the message quality was poor enough that I'm returning it. Fortunately Amazon makes that easy and painless -- go Amazon!"
3,Fun idea...,"I got this game because, like so many other reviewers, it was like $5 EB Games. It's well worth the $5, I got a bit of enjoyment out of it.The game itself is fun, I had a great time playing it. The scenarios are funny (though farfetched) and I had a laugh out loud moment every time my lawyers got a new case.Unfortunately the game had some serious flaws that were kind of annoying. The characters didn't interact well with items - my character would sit on a couch, then stand up and be standing right inside the couch. That sort of thing happened a lot. Also, a lot of times the characters just did what they wanted, instead of what *I* wanted - and that was aggravating at times.This game is cheap enough that its worth the price, but it really doesn't even come close in comparison with the Sims. The Sims costs a lot more (especially with expansions), but it is a lot more fun and a lot less buggy."
4,Girl Books,We all know where 'Real Beauty' comes from. Why not start your young lady out early in learning that beauty is more than skin deep? Help the preteen in your life be more selfconfident and beautiful by knowing how to accomplish this elusive trait.
4,Man or Astro Man? The Band of the FUTURE!,"Take my word from a devoted fan...MOAM kick intergalaxtic Planetarium Astro buddy. The only reason why I give 1000X is because it's not one of their finest albums...But I'm just saying this because of a lack of songs. They are a great example of REAL independant music they are one of the most original bands I have ever 'Experienced"" and I do guarentee you will have an astro-smile on your face. (Buy project infinaty first. That's their best album if your ganna ask me."
1,Poor Voice Quality,"Poor voice quality. You have to go more expensive for good digital voice quality. The 1717 model was better. If you want a good digital inexpensive one, find the 1717 model."
1,"Do NOT BUY, Save yourself the trouble.","This is my 5th attempt to fail at getting my negative review posted! I wanted to stay away from the silver phones and liked the price so purchased this phone. So sorry I did.The sound is terrible. It sounded like I was talking in a can, and as others have said it has an irritating echo. It was not comfortable to hold in my hand. I could not find one redeeming quality about this phone except it's price. It looked very cheap to me once I got it home.As I went to return the phone, the customer service rep said I was the second person that morning to return the same phone! I was not suprised.Instead I bought the chrome and lavender V tech and I really really love that perfect more expensive phone."
2,LCD Screen faulty after 1 year,"The phone works fine, except that the LCD panel for the Caller ID is no longer readable after 1 year. AT&T says to just buy a new phone, which is a shame because the rest of the phone works fine."
2,Got buzz?,"I compared the 2230 with the Uniden TRU346 and bought the AT&T because it had a mute button and fit better to my ear. Unfortunately, as did another reviewer, I note a bad buzz when connected to another caller. The person I was calling remarked about the buzz also.I like the feature set, but I can't keep a phone that sounds worse than the 900MHz phone it is replacing."
1,nice if you like to hear yourself speak,"If I could give this phone no stars I would have. It is the worst phone I ever bought. There is always an echo on the line when you are on it and the sound quality is terrible. If you read the reviews for this phone you will see that the good ones are in a very small minority. Listen to us: ""DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE""!"
1,Personally I'd say don't buy!,"I have had this phone for two months and have experienced too problems with it.It does not hold a charge.I get the ""OUT OF SERVICE"" message too often.Horrible echoStatic noiseRedial only holds one numberI will seriously advice anyone to reconsider this purchase."
1,Avoid this Phone,This phone is the worst I ever had no screen on one hand set the other the battery failed and now the neither of the handset will sync to the base wish I could give a 0 shame on ATT for putting their name on this P.O.S.
5,I don't understand the poor reviews!,This is the best phone(s) I have ever had in my life! I bought this phone system two years ago and have never had any of the problems the other reviewers mentioned. My husband and I use the handsets daily and have absolutely NO complaints about them. We live in an old home (built in 1872) and didn't want to put yet another hole in the house to have a phone on the 2nd and 3rd floors. This phone is easy to hold and the batteries last over 2 days without being in the chargers. Our cat even chewed on the power cord several times before she finally got all the way through. I think this is a quality product that I plan on purchasing for two couples as Christmas gifts this year.
1,Piece of Junk!,"This is a terrible phone. Every time I use it, people on the other end of the conversation tell me they can barely hear me. The batteries last maybe two days at the most. This is a terrible phone."
1,not worth it,"Not very good was dissapointed,difficult to manuvere,I am used to world of watctaft graphics and game playr,this was not a very good substitute"
4,ER is always awesome and addicting.,Love the characters--seems like you know them as you watch the show. I know George Clooney will leave soon and that will affect the show.
2,ok but....,"pros: good concept, works with existing phones, once you get past buggy initial setup, it works well... remote dial in is a genius concept (if they can make it work with your ans machine)cons: PC needed and must be on at all times... software is buggy..(the software that comes with disk defaults to wrong voice driver all the time).. need to d/l new sware from manuf website. Does not work with your existing answering machine... (either PC receives call or the machine)."
4,great bra,this bra is very pretty and fits well.It came in the mail in good shape and in just a few days
2,Bra,Should of order a size larger was too tight. When a person wants this style they need to get the next size up all of the bras that i ordered thru the internet was too small.
3,If you are looking for a theatrical ending version in Blu-Ray,"Most people like me find Directors Cut ending weaker than the theatrical one.If you want to get BR version with the theatrical ending search google using one of the following EAN codes:8715664051740 (this one is with Netherlands subtitles)or7350019705261 (Nordic Countries subtitles)You can turn off subtitles. You will have an alternate ending as a bonus + deleted scenes, director comments and other extras as well."
2,Just Okay,"I'd rent before purchasing. If you have a slow Friday night its worth the time for a rental DVD. I bought based on info from friends and I wish I had saved my money. For the most part its your run of the mill horror/ghost story. The plot is thin, the acting is B quality, and the special affect are very noticeable."
2,The great twist never comes.,I felt like this whole movie was a build up to something that never happened. I kept expecting a great twist or at least some explanation as to why the room is haunted. It never came. Very disappointing.
3,I supppose it is okay,I got this as a present. I am one of the few ppl in the family that doesn't really like creepy movies. I tried watching it 2 times and didn't make it through. I didn't really think it was scarey just creepy.
3,How Not To Adapt a Stephen King Story,"1408 is one of the creepiest stories I have ever read. It is up there with HP Lovecraft's best for me. This movie, although King claims it is one of his favorite adaptations, is frankly a mediocre attempt at everyday horror cliches. We have the dying child, the worried wife, the concerned boss, the aging father. None of these appeared in the original story, which was a ten or so page chill fest. This is a movie that wanted to be good, but failed miserably. John Cusack as the protagonist going to pieces was great, don't get me wrong. If they had given him King's material to work with, Cusack would have been great. But Hollywood as usual scotched the deal by introducing a sentimental undertone that pretty much shiprwecked the story line. (Pun intended.)"
3,"For a book to film comparison, the book will always be better.","The book scared the $**!T out of me, and even MORE the second time. The movie-barely at all. Two or three good scares through the whole film. As for the theatrical release verses the Director's cut, I disagree with previous reviews and by far prefer the Director's cut. I feel I could watch that MANY more times then I could watch the other, where as the other I don't think I'd need more than the first viewing. And the D's cut has a much creepier feel and added scare. And this set also comes with post cards!"
5,Theatrical Release= 5 Stars; Director's Cut= 3.5 Stars,"The theatrical release (included on the two-disc edition) is an eerie, effective psychological horror film in the tradition of ""Rosemary's Baby"" (you'll even notice one of the other hotel guests with a familiar baby carriage...). There's very little blood and gore--and that's a good thing. It ends up being 13 times creepier than dozens of other recent spookfests.One note: Stay away from the director's cut (disc two). The director's cut ending, besides being a ""bit of a downer"" according to test audiences, feels bloated by comparison to the theatrical version. Thank god for test audiences!"
1,I guess anyone can make a movie these days.,This movie had great potential. I mean it had a good story and some good stars in it but it just wasn't made right and the movie was a big waste of money and talent. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone except the tasteless.
1,Dont even bother....,"I was really excited to see 1408, after all its Stephen King, and has two Hollywood power-players starring in it. However, after about an hour I couldn't watch anymore and had to give up. My husband finished it and even though he loves horror films more than I, he agrees that it was overly done, tried way too hard to be scary and have twists/turns, and just missed the boat somehow.I wish I knew what could have been done to make the movie better, but its hard to pinpoint exactly what I hated a about it... perhaps I went in expecting too much? Perhaps I was scared about the occurrences in the room because I frequently stay in hotel rooms? Or perhaps it was just a bad film? I guess you can decide if you absolutely must rent it or buy it for yourself, but I just can't give this one my endorsement."
3,Not that much original here,"Maybe I'm jaded in my old age but I didn't see a whole lot that was new here. While a great tour-de-force opportunity for Cusack to monopolize the screen, the basic story seemed more an extension of the hotel room scene from ""The Shining"" and the ""guy-on-the-ledge"" scene from the ""Cat's Eye""."
2,over rated,"i was extremly dissapointed when i watched this movie, i should of listened to the rumor mill. wasn't scary at all! can't anyone do stephen kings amazing novels any justice?"
4,A Movie,"I like the movie. This is what I call a movie when it is is not what you expect. The storyline is not traditional but new in concept. Also, I like the actors John Cusack and Samuel Jackson/"
1,"Works great, except it will randomly disconect during calls","I guess it's a phone with a sense of humor--or it's very sensitive, one of the two. The features are nice, but something sticks when I lift the reciever, so it will keep ringing even though the reciever is up. In addition, I think something is wrong with the cord, because if you move slightly during conversations, it will cut out. Voice quality is kind of scratchy, too. Neat features, but if you want neat features to play with on your phone, get a cellphone and play with the endless pleathora of ring tones."
1,Don't Buy! Horrible!,"The answering machine part of the phone stopped working after two days. The warranty repair service required me to try to fix the problem myself by resetting the internal software. I did this several times, and each time, the answering machine worked for two days. After repeatedly phoning AT&T;, they agreed to send me a replacement which is warranted for 90 days, not one year as the original phone is warranted. I will never buy another AT&T; branded product.Update: Replacement arrived, and it has the same problem. I'm done."
4,mandy lane,"I wanted to see this movie forever, finally saw it and it was pretty cool, even though its a english blu ray it will play on yours, I played it on my PS3-the movie played but not the special features, I would recommened this movie."
2,HD instant video not available for me.,"HD instant video not available for PC, otherwise the video is ok. I can't believe someone would pay for the rental."
2,hype,The hype sold this movie and I was very dissapointed in the product. Wish I had never spent the money.
1,"Failed, 2 for 2","I purchased two of these in April, 2009. The first failed in the second month, the second just failed today. In both cases, I received the message ""memory card error"" in two different cameras (neither would read them). Nothing like losing hundreds of pictures to make you really happy about a product. The low price isn't worth losing photos."
2,2 small.,"With the price of hi speed sd cards so low nowadays, there is no point in buying such a small card.You shouldn't buy anything less than a class 10 8 gig card, they are usually around $1.50 a gig or less now."
4,Tape can fix anything!,"I have no complaints for this product specifically, it works great! However, if you use SD cards as often as I do, you know that they tend to have the sliding lock on the side. And you also know that with this lock comes the headache you get when you insert the card (into the computer) and it locks itself. However, a little piece of scotch tape over the unlocked slider can prevent this from being a problem, keeping the slider in place.Other than that, I got this card for $.29 (+ shipping), so I am very happy to report that there is absolutely nothing wrong or strange about it!Hopefully someday soon SD cards come with a lock that doesn't require extra at-home-assembly."
5,Excellent!,"Apocalyptica is really a band that you must hear to believe. They are very talented musicians, and they reach all the depths and heights fully in their chosen form of expression. They can be as hard as any of the Heavy Metal bands, or as wistful and timeless as any classical piece I have heard. This album is perfect for my husband and I to enjoy together, because he likes music that is quite hard and aggressive, while I tend towards more emotional depth and classical/traditional forms. Apocalyptica is a fusion of classical and Heavy/Death metal, so it appeals to both of us very nicely."
5,What can I say? AMAZING!,"These guys are amazing. I wrote a review for ""Cult"", another album and that review definitely applies here too! Our family LOVES their music, all of it!"
3,Good I dea but...,"Ah, it took me FOREVER to get through this book! At the begining the story was really dragging, but I knew that if I could get though it Marjorie Liu's book was next!The series is a good idea for lovers of the Vampire/ Werewolf genre but I don't know if Maverick was the best idea to start it.She did speed up the character developement & Crimson City did end up an OK read. It's not absolutely neccisary to read it before Liu's book, though it is helpful.Fleur Dumont becomes ruler of all of L.A.'s vampires after an assasination of her her step-siblings. Plagued by former scandal, Fleur's causing more by working overly closely with Dain, a human military aget, to e the mmmmmrers. This sets up all the coming tensiuon in Crimson City's series...more vamps to come, along with werewolves!"
4,A Good One!,"As a Kindle user, this one is money well spent. Tight, good dialog, interesting descriptive passages and characters a reader can like. And I am hard to please when it comes to reading material. Too many good books out there to waste time on those poorly written."
3,Mindless Read,"I found this book to be a quick, entertaining, mindless read. Good for filling a wet afternoon or long air trip. Not much substance, not a particularly original plot, but not a waste of time, either."
2,"A monitor, not controller",".. It monitors and forecasts the cost of power usage, but it won't control.. Those 3 buttons are very difficult to click. The TARIFF setting only accept 2 digits after decimal point, while PG&E uses 0.11589 which is 5 digits. The limitation on the TARIFF setting is the major problem which makes the cost forecasting away from precision.. Not a precise device. Not recommended to buy."
4,Needs a Mute button on Handset!,"I've owned this phone for a good 6 months, and use most all the features weekly.. I enjoy the wonderful clarity, range and volume controls.. However... every once in a while, it shows someone being on line 2 when there would only be someone on line 1.. hmm..not good when hubby is on line 1 and I want to connect to the internet on line 2..have to go to the base and manually disconnect line 2. the only other gripes I have is that you have to press the hold button in order to switch from speakerphone to handset, and it definitely needs a mute button on the handset. Otherwise this phone serves me quite well during my weekly conference calls."
2,Poor sound quality,"This was the only white, cordless, 2-line, wall-mountable phone I could find (and I think I searched everywhere) which is why I bought it. But the sound quality is so poor as to be almost unusable. Someone described it as overmodulated, and I think that's accurate. There's not a whole lot of static (although more than there should be), but the voice sounds like it's been run through a ""robot voice changer"" toy. Well not that bad but you get the idea. And people on the other end ask me to repeat myself often so it seems to be both ways.We have it in the kitchen and only use it to answer calls and then go to another phone to talk."
2,nausea,"I remember buying this album long, long ago... the artwork is cool... when dogs bark they are proclaiming their identity as dog... great, really.Then the music. It literally made me nauseous... and with repeated listenings... still physically nauseous...And I like a lot of experimental music, free jazz and indie rock... but... not this, definitely not this.At least this band doesn't have the drummer that throws tantrems on stage... though they have the other guy."
4,Problems?,"Hi, I absolutely love this game. But 30 days (game time) into it it tells me that I need to check the printed manual for a certain page, paragraph, word but the word I enter never seems 2 be right. Then it quits and tells me the 30 day trial version is over and I have to start the game over. Does anyone else have these problems? If so, email sunspungirl@hotmail.com"
2,Needs Work,"This game, while including some very nice expansions on the original Airline Tycoon, had some major bugs in it.For starters, parts of the text in the game were in German. Particularly the news-stand articles. Also, part of the airport announcements were done in German, and English. The copy of the game I had was supposed to be the US release version, so there should have been 0 German text to begin with.Furthermore, the planes that the player could build weren't painted in the livery of the player's airline. They were left in unpainted metal. Furthermore, the design elements were limited, and some not very attractive. It gave the aircraft a cartoonish look.Overall, I'm disappointed with Airline Tycoon: Evolution. If you ask me, it was more of a De-evolution."
3,"Good game, but has snags,","This game is fun, for the most part. It can get slow if to much is running, at times. Get the patches, maybe update your drivers also, turn the midi off from the game in options. The midi seems to slow it, or it drags.It is addicting when working right.Some people may have no problems with this game, I guess it depends on your computer.When the game is running smooth, it's hours of fun.Buy it,"
1,Stick with the original,"When I first bought this game I was looking for a replacement for the one my niece destroyed. It is the most annoying games that anyone could think of. The programming could have been done better by a 3 year old, as the game is full of errors and, if like me, your computer is not on the internet and you have to use another computer for the internet, the game is completely useless."
1,Bit dissapointed about the product,"I'm a bit dissapointed about the product because in the specifications didn't said that the ""Battery On Board"" CANNOT BE REPLACED. Either in the webpage... I thought I could...And what will happened when the battery on board died? Do we need to trash the entire equipment? What will happen with the enviroment?I sent an email to SolarStyle and they answered me the following:-The battery in the SC002 cannot be replaced or removed-So take this into consideration...Brgds,Cesar"
2,Need To Be A Big Fan,I recognise that this is an important film but I think you have to be a big fan of Gables to really enjoy it.
4,Clark Gable in San Francisco,"THis is a great movie to have in your collection. Plenty of old fashioned action and the earthquake in San Francisco is very well done for the time. Pity the DVD is B&W as I also have video in colour. The colourised version is quite a good product, better than other colourised films I have seen."
3,Road bike or MTB??,The description that is provided here does not give any indication that this is a road bike cassette or a MTB cassette..nor are there any customer reviews pointing one way or the other..I ordered.I then received the order detail...turns out that its a 'Deore' - ok that an MTB cassette. I have to cancel this order for the second time in two weeks..and this is annoying game to play. Peace.3 stars for nothing really - just wanted to get the information out there..
5,Replacement part. Still works after more than a year.,"Needed a replacement. The exact same part came off my bike. My old one has the smallest cog wear after a season or two of use and my chain was jumping. New one installed with no issues. I supposed I could have ordered just a new cog, but figured best to get a new cassette. Still working after over a year of use."
5,A new me,This book brought a new meaning to how i take care of myself. I strongly reccomend this book to all woman.
5,Great!,"I have made 5 recipes in this book, and each time I have had great successes! I would recommend that you have some time on your hands to prepare these great recipes, and get a Kitchen Aid heavy duty mixer! With these elements you'll be on your way to creating great desserts that your freinds and family will enjoy!"
5,The best innovative desserts that your friends will rave abo,This book has many dessert recipes that your friends will rave about for weeks to come. The Cranberry recipe is to die for.
4,I like them,"I was a little worried about the 'tight' fit, but it actually looks pretty good because of the thick, black elastic material used. I am a size 6 and purchased a medium and they fit perfect."
5,Incredible Fusion,"This was the first KBB album I was able to get my hands on. I have never attended NEARfest, but missing the 2006 line-up hurt the worst. This band is AMAZING! I read elsewhere on the net that the song 'Discontinuous Spiral' is one of the best fusion tracks of the past 5 years. I would go further than that. It is probably one of the best EVER! The second tune 'Kraken's Brain is Blasting' recalls the violin period of King Crimson a little bit. 'Backside edge' has a killer bass run in it that I always stop whatever I am doing to listen to. 'Shironiji' is a beautiful piece, and a perfect album closer. Top notch musicianship... and this is only their second album! (Check out their debut 'Lost and Found' as well!) Not a bad song on here. Features: Akihisa Tsuboy - violin, cellolin & guitars - Dani on bass and guitars - Shirou Sugano on drums - and a new addition to the band, Toshimitsu Takahashi on keyboards."
3,High Noon without Gary Cooper,"This is my first read of a Silva book, and I can honestly say I enjoyed it. However I kept expecting the showdown between Gabe & Tariq. Even more incredible is the fact that Taliq, at the last minute, allows President Arafat to live. Also a former model, after escaping imprisonment and certain death, is the one who introduces Taliq to his maker. For me it was a poor ending to an otherwise great read. I'm not sure I'll go any further with the Allon series."
2,Long. Slow. Boring.,"Sorry, folks. I wanted to like it. I gave it a chance. But it just goes on and on and on ... hardly a page-turner! Too much like Tom Clancy's later books!"
3,"Good read, but disappointing twist","This is Daniel Silva's first Gabriel Allon novel, and I read it immediately after reading his very first novel, a WWII spy thriller called ""The Unlikely Spy."" It is a page turner, no question about it, but at its conclusion, Silva uses a plot device that he also used in ""The Unlikely Spy."" Giving away the device would spoil the ending, so I won't describe it, but it didn't work there, and it doesn't work here. In his effort to add just one more twist, Silva spoils the story and makes you ask, what was the point? I'll go on to read at least one more in this series, but you have to be a great fan to not coming away a bit disappointed with this effort."
2,Mediocre spy thriller,"The characters were boring, the bad guys acted stupidly, it never really take off. It was a lot worse than Brad Thor or Vince Flynn novels."
5,When Allons on the job you get a great story!,Like all the Gabriel Allon series books. Always well written with a credible plot and the end is never what you expect.
4,A Little Closure??,"It's the buzz word these days--closure. Well, you won't get any in this novel. Silva writes extremely well. He spins us around Europe. He takes us through market stalls packed with Middle Eastern humanity and stuffed with smells. Until the last twenty or thirty pages it was a great read. But what happened to the main characters?? They drift off alone, back to their own lonely and miserable lives. Come on! Even real people don't behave that way. Silva, really, what were you thinking?"
1,Warning: this isn't the solo debut of the OTHER Roger Taylor,"As it turns out, it's the solo album by Queen's (not DuranDuran's) Roger Taylor. This alone is enough to give it one star. Sorry, but I have to warn consumers who were assuming this is a good record. It's not."
5,Beautiful Book,Well written by someone who knows her whales about actual whales. It has to be fairly unique to have a text by Alexandra Morton who had followed these whales and studied orcas for nearly twenty years when she wrote this book and underwater photos of these very animals taken by her late husband. Her book Listening to Whales describes her life dedicated to whales and her family. Also great reading if you are interested in the Northern Orcas.
2,Amazon playing nasty games with prices,"AFter searching for this product with another, I had to leave for a few hours before ordering, when I returned to place order, price had jumped significantly.I also noted this on a camera I was looking at. In this crummy economy, they INCREASED the price the day after I looked at it. Seems possible they have tracking and are trying to force people to buy quickly, or like the airlines, are now adjusting prices up any time they see a change in interest or demand.Not a change I like from a past excellent company, and it is costing me time to find better prices elsewhere - not to mention their losing the business they would otherwise have had."
5,A must have for Intermountain gardeners,"I bought this book back in the mid-1990's after attending a lecture by Lauren Springer. Of all the books in my extensive garden book collection- I would list this as one of the top 3. As a Landscape Architect, I frequently review the suggested plantings and incorporate many of the plants she suggests into my xeriscape designs for clients. When her book first came out, it was difficult to find seeds (let alone plants) that are profiled in the book. Fortunately, most of the plants are available now but some may require ordering from places like High Country Gardens.As others have said, she has an interesting writing style that will have you reading and enjoying the text- not just looking at the pretty pictures!"
5,Blues Deluxe,"*Hard Again* says it all. If you like your blues straight up, there ain't no messin' 'round here. The collaborative effort on this album is extra-ordinary. ""Mannish Boy"" is a great jam session with harp, vocals, and guitar. ""I Can't be Satisfied"" is some of the best recorded acoustic slide by Johnny Winter...and ""Deep Down in Florida"" the ""sun shines damn near every day."""
5,Happiness - What Bliss!,"This is such a beautiful album that is really personal. Happiness has much more of Roger's trademark apolitical views but not in a harsh way. Each track is very well written and Roger's voice is so versitile; it sounds best on this album. Some fans feel that the album is missing Roger's powerful rock ability but considereing that it was his first solo album released after Freddie's death, I think the softer mood of this album is more appropriate."
4,Not a Collins Best,"Madison Castelli is one of the main female characters in the book.She's no Lucky Santangelo that's for sure, but she's a good character.She's beautiful, of course, so I couldn't understand why she washanging on to grief about her ex-lover having walked out on her foranother woman...two years ago.Madison's best friend, Jamie Nova,finds out that her perfect husband is cheating on her in the mostdevious manner. Rosarita Falcon is the bitchiest character I've comeacross in a long time. She is unhappily married to a handsome butunsuccessful soap opera star, Dexter, whose real name is DickCockranger can you believe it? too funny. Rosarita is having a torridaffair with Joel Blaine, public sex fanatic and son of billionaireLeon Blaine. Rosarita asks her father to kill her husband, Dexter,since she believes her father is in the mob. We never do actuallylearn if he is in the mob or not. ...Not the best of Collins,but a fun read nonetheless."
2,Did she just get tired of writing?,"I'm at a loss. This book started out gang-busters, typical Collins ..... lots of raunchy sex, bitchy characters, the hooker with the heart of gold, the handsome underdog. With not a lot of character development, Collins weaves a fast-paced plot that keeps you turning the page. But all of a sudden, you start to feel like you're in one of those restaurants where the waiters try to rush you out the door so they can seat more customers. Detail and explanation are deemed unimportant ...... Collins rushes at breakneck pace to finish, and then just stops. Instead of telling the rest of the story -- and believe me, there's plenty left to tell -- she just ends it and gives you a few-sentence description of what happened to each character. I felt so cheated. I would rather invest my time in a well-developed story that actually has an evolved ending. Oh yeah, that's Nora Roberts! So long, Jackie."
2,This Is The Worst Yet,"I am an avid reader of JC and I always love all of her books. However, this one didnt quite do it for me. I found it to be exciting at the beginning then like a lot of people, I found the ending to be rushed with definately *unfinished business*. I was most disapointed with this one and all I can say is that I hope there will be a sequel to this, if only to put some of the plots and characters into a better perspective."
4,WHEW! HOT HOT HOT!,"I am a BIG JC fan! I have read every book she has ever written and this is one of her best, in my opinion. Madison Castelli is a great charcter, along with her best friend Jamie.I am really glad that Madison and Jake finally hit it off in this book. AND what a romance it is......As usual, JC leaves you clinging to your seat. I found myself, a few times skimming forward, trying to get a peek at was was going to happen next. Then I would stop myself. Didn't want to ruin it. Really, read this book. It IS a page turner, and the ending.....I won't ruin it for you. BUT it leaves you breathless and wanting MORE MORE MORE!"
1,Comic book,"The first of Collins' novels that I thought was a complete waste of time (but it's only the second one I've ever read). Characters are very shallow and totally unbelievable. The book is a repository for every conceivable thought that any of the characters might ever think about sex. In fact, that's all the book is about---sex. And not good sex at that. The extreme and gratuitous vulgar and obscene language adds to the lack of depth not only of the characters but of the book itself. It is really litle more than a comic book without the pictures."
1,Terrible,"I HATED this book. I couldn't even get all the way through it. There was no plot at all, just sex. It wasn't even arousing sex; it was very boring. It is the worst book I have ever read, and I'd give it no stars if I could. I DO NOT recommend this book to anyone."
4,There better be a sequel,"This is classice Jackie Collins and a very fast read (2days). But I have so many questions. There better be a sequel and I hope it comes out soon. I was very disappointed of the ending it just left too many stones unturned. I want to know more about Madison's family, what happens to the witch Rosarita, who will Leon leave all his money to, who really was the father of Rosarita's baby, will Jamie confront David,and who is this Gem?? I thought Madison and Dexter would wind up getting together (maybe next book). All I have left to say is I WANT MORE!!!!!!!!!"
3,What happened to Ms. Collins?,"I have read all her books, this one just does not have that spice as all the others.Is she loosing her touch?"
4,When you want to belong to someone,"When ""That Pesky Rat"" (who has no name) wants to become someone's pet, he starts his search by asking his friends about their lives with their owners. After listening to their advice he contacts the local pet store proprietor about finding an owner of his own. She tells him no one would want a rat for a pet, but this feisty fellow doesn't give up. He makes his own advertisement and waits until a special someone comes along."
3,detailed and accurate depiction of Eastern Shore life,"I was attracted to this book because it is about the Eastern Shore of Maryland, my childhood home. After noting the author's name, I was stunned to find I had attended high school with him. Even more astounding was the quality and truthfulness of his depiction of a waterman's life. I recognized many of the characters and situations in the book from my own experience. If you enjoyed ""Beautiful Swimmers"" or ""Chesapeake"" for the unique culture of the ""Shore"" you'll enjoy this novel as well."
1,"It's not right, it's not even wrong","Like his protagonist, Junkins tries to catch a feel for the waters and the life of a waterman, but quickly finds himself out of his depth due to a lack of understanding. The story first strives, unsuccessfully, to be poignant, then once Roget's has been exhausted, the author seemingly tacks-on some wholly implausible drama to stretch out what really is short story material. There are many other, more accurate, credible, and enjoyable books about the east coast's most precious estuarine gem."
5,World-Class Trip,"This is a film in a category by itself. It's a thriller, perhaps. It's a mystery, perhaps. It's political, perhaps. It doesn't comfortably fit into any one, all-inclusive category and it doesn't use any cliches I've ever seen. The photography is amazing and the actors manage well enough. This isn't an actor's film. The mystery angle is given to the viewer to piece together an abundance of information scattered along the way. There is suspense, but not of any traditional kind. Its implications are political, economic and moral. What we don't know can definitely hurt us - and has - and is.Curtis Stotlar"
2,WHAT!?,ya know i would have enjoyed this movie alot more if i knew everything that was goingon but i couldnt ya know sumthin i think that this movie had no story all it did is just show a whole bunch of spontaniose things in each scene i tried to make good heads or tails of the plot but ultimately it was a futile effort
3,Cold War Attitudes in Remarkably Incoherent Film,"I have to admit this was far too artsy a production for me. None of the characters were sufficiently defined to care about, none of the action sufficiently comprehensible to break through the torpor induced by the cross-cutting of scenes and characters. The cynicism which was the hallmark of fine cold war films, was marked, but I was led to indifference since it was all puppetry devoid of human characteristics. I shouldn't think any blame accrues to the actors whose playing seemed to be in tune with the desires of writers and the director; George Clooney, in particular, is to be congratulated for his heroic underplaying which dimmed his impact to near zero.Over-all, it was quite an achievement to convert a hot issue into a bedtime story."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"The editing is cryptic to the point of making the film unwatchable. Every scene buries whatever pertinent, relevent piece of information it conveys in static. You'll still be waiting for the ultimate point of most scenes to be releaved when they end. After the 20th scene that seemed to have no relevence to any previous scene I pretty much stopped paying attention. Despite writing and direction being credited to Stephen Gaghan the film bears so much similarity the tv series K Street produced by Soderbergh and Clooney that I'd assume they were calling the shots in the editing room if not restructuring the script to fit their cryptic style. I assume even those who were dedicated enough to work out what the film is actually about would have to admit that the statement could have been driven home better with a more coherent narrative."
2,Tedious and complicated,I found this film rather boring. It was too complicated and too long. Most of the time I wasn't even sure of what was going on. I have seen Geroge Clooney in much better films.
1,Don't waste 2 hours of your life,"This is a truly awful movie that contains some fine acting, a fact which causes me to feel guilty about hating it so much. With 290+ reviews, I'm not going to write anything of length, except to say that when you see the end of the movie, you'll be astonished that all the pseudo-virtuosic storytelling techniques--which made it so tediously complicated, a mental exercise nowhere approaching entertainment or edification--simply resulted in a display of the most banal stereotypes imaginable. If you react like I did, you'll hate yourself for sticking with it to its incredibly trite end, because the payout, after a lot of labor, is really scant.What a bore."
2,Sloooooooooow,"I found it interesting, but was tempted to turn it off several times. My 19 year-old daughter fell asleep, and my wife went to bed. I did watch the whole thing, but if I wasn't interested in the subject, I wouldn't have."
2,Movie Too Convoluted,"Too many storylines! The scenes jumped around all the time. The filmmakers didn't blend the the storylines in ""Syriana"" very well together, so it left the movie ending hanging out there as to what the meaning of the movie was really suppose to be.The only redeeming feature was the acting and the cinematography."
1,Like Going to the Dentist,"What happened to the days when watching a movie was an escapist experience? This movie makes you look at the clock more than the subtitles (which you have to have on, in order to follow the droll, elephant trodding they call a script)!I hope the negatives are lost for the sake of posterity.Clooney sucks also...as usual.Jack"
4,Disturbing but Great,A good musical with great dance scenes and songs that tell a truthful but tragic story. Should be in all school libraries
1,Waaaay overrated!!!,"God, I would rather pay $4.00 a gallon than see Syriana again. This is one of those movies that you THINK you're supposed to like, buy you don't really know afterward. I've seen complicated movies that are good and/or fun to watch. Syriana is NOT one of them. The one part that was entertaining at all was the scene with the caravan of vehicles, one of which gets targeted and destroyed with a bomb. That alone had some suspense and generated interest as I watched it unfold. Otherwise, this movie was a bomb itself. It features great actors (Clooney, Alexander Siddig, etc.) but just isn't worth the money or the time. I'm sure many will disagree with me, but it's my personal opinion, and that's all it is."
3,Pretty good for a mainstream multiplex thing,"This is a good movie. Syriana captures the total confusion I think we all feel when digesting current events. The acting is pretty average, but the camera work & cinematography is first rate. My problem is it just doesn't go far enough to really say anything or show the real deal behind the scenes. Except for the scene ehen George Clooney returns to the CIA to find himself persona non grata' (the best scene in the movie because it seems so real)there isn't enough there there to be a classic. Still, it is worth seeing & sadly it is better than 75% of the mainstream movies out there today. What does that say about us?"
3,Great movie but save the $ and get the DVD instead.,"The movie is great, but the image quality is no better than DVD since it wasn't remastered for hi-def, but is only upconverted from the 480i DVD image. The same applies to the soundtrack, which is compressed Dolby AC3 (Dolby Digital) instead of the higher quality PCM uncompressed audio. I guess the producers of the disc got lazy, as 24 Bit 48khz uncompressed PCM audio tracks are delivered for every film soundtrack, so it wouldn't have been costly to put those audio tracks on the Blu-Ray disc, though perhaps it might have been costly to re-scan the negative into 1080p HD format. The only reason to buy a Blu-Ray disc as opposed to a DVD is to see the film in hi-def, which is much closer to an actual film print in terms of resolution than DVD. No need to bother getting the Blu-Ray disc here since it's not genuinely hi-def."
2,"Surprisingly, the poor reviews were spot on","I was aware of this film's poor reviews going in, but it's George Clooney - how bad can it be? Well, pretty bad. I could forgive the self-righteousness of this film, but not the mess that is the screenplay. I spent the first hour wondering when the disjointed plot elements would come together, and the second half realizing they probably never would. To compare this movie to Traffic is a flattery it does not deserve. Basically what you get is a rather confused propaganda piece that can be summed up this way: US government: bad. Oil companies: extra, extra bad. Clearly, Mr. Clooney the politician got ahead of Mr. Clooney the actor on this one."
2,Don't take this one too seriously,"This movie is entertaining. It really is a good thing to watch, but only if you keep in mind that it is a movie. It is not a newscast, not a documentary, its just a movie. I am sympathetic to those who don't want to attack our use of oil for fear of upsetting the economy. But they are taking things too far by claiming its propaganda. Its not, its just a decent movie. That's all. So watch this one and enjoy."
4,Great movie!,Great movie. Important story. Good acting. Nice to see something relevant in these times.
1,"If you like kaleidoscopes, this movie's for you . . .","The images, mostly of familiar, stereotypical people and institutions we read about, are not I expect meant to provide depth and insight.I get the images as they are shuffled through; but not a lot of meaning comes through. Nothing new, no insights or informative portrayals. Like, all headline and no bodycopy.The writer/director's aim seems all for style's sake. But with such a complex subject, a wee bit of comprehension would've been maybe something which would have saved this scramble of half-made, flickering observations. A sad disappointment, considering what I thought to be extremely talented people."
2,Interview with Writer,"Just a bit of insight to everyone who wants to take this movie for real life. I watched an interview on my HDNET channel with the writer and he said he traveled the middle east, met with oil officials, and more but ultimately created fictional characters and circumstances to make the movie more dramatic and gripping when asked. A bit of advice, enjoy movies but don't take them for a history lesson."
3,music good but too much vulgarity,I was disappointed that potentially good music would have some much vulgarity. Not for children.
4,War movie,It's a great movie. The facts are correct but the time line isn't. My Dad fought in this battle on Guadalcanal (Battle of Tenaru). My wife and I stood on the sand bar that was in the movie and we saw the exact spot where this machine gun nest was located. The only problem was that the disc had several bad spots during the last 15 minutes of the movie. It caused problems with the picture and sound.
5,Best leave-in conditioner I've found,"I was at wit's end trying to find something to combat our really hard well water. I've tried Biolage, Paul Mitchell, and a half dozen others I can't remember and all of them left my hair feeling even worse-- seriously. I couldn't even run a brush or comb though hair I sprayed with Aveda leave in conditioner. I found this when my hair stylist used it on my hair. I wear a swing bob, so it's essential to have smooth hair in order for the ""do"" to work. At the same time, too heavy a conditioner will make you look like you have one giant clumpy hair on your head. This stuff is just awesome and so is the Paul Brown Washe Elite (what does washe mean, anyhow?!) I live in an area with about 15 percent humidity on the the dampest of days, so this does a great job smoothing out fly-away hairs and keeping even the gray shiny."
2,Pure Garbage,"I bought this unit because of its cool display. And I have to give it that--it has a great display and great sound. It supports surround sound and DBBS. It can also recharge batteries. The problem is that everything else is pure garbage. You can't listen to quiet music--there is no volume setting between ""mute"" and ""too loud."" It take about 90 second to read a disc. The hiss while jogging is pretty bad, and there isn't even a belt clip!After opening the box, it cut off at the end of the first song I played. As it started to play the next song, it froze. Yes froze, just like a Windows computer. I couldn't stop it or anything. I opened the cover, removed the CD, and it still kept spinning. I had to remove the batteries to reset it.I've been listening to it play three songs as I wrote this review, and it cut off before the end of all of them. This is going back tomorrow. Heck, this one might be going back yet tonight."
2,It looks like I'm going RioVolt after all...,"I've had this unit for over 2 months now. First problem was the first unit I brought home was defective, brand new in the package. After a swap out, I used this thing on and off until I finally got enough NiMH rechargeables to be able to swap. Now that I'm using it constantly, here's the rundown. This seems to be VERY temperature sensitive. After warming up, it seems to work reasonably well. Until then, it will skip through the first 4 or 5 songs randomly. Then, the volume control is digital, and there is DEFINITELY not enough volume for my use (in car thru cassette). The backlight problem seems trivial until you run into it. I don't believe this is a reasonable alternative to the RioVolt SP250 from what I've read lately, and the prices for all the units seemed to have dropped precipitously recently from when I purchased this. Don't compromise unless you are TRULY strapped for the difference."
1,DON'T buy it,"I have the same problems as everyone else mentioned. The machine pops and squeals and cuts off tracks at the end. I was very disappointed, since I had almost purchased the Phillips unit. I've waited too long to return it, so it just goes in the scrap heap. I will be very cautious about buying any RCA products again."
2,shipping is Too high,"This store looks like cheaper than other stores, but shipping is about 30% of purchase price. When try to buy $50 worth of bit and pins, shipping is over $15. Better be pricing honestly."
1,"Pure Garbage, Whats in the Water in the UK?????????????","This is pure, unadulterated garbage. The fact that it charts (#1 no less) is a testament to the demise of good music and the gullability of the buying public. Thank God in the US we have stellar artists like Ashlee Simpson to look up to. Shame on you Britons for this rubbish"
2,Didn't learn anything new,I was hoping to learn something new and this is just a rehash of the same old stuff.
1,Not a quality pot- would not recommend,"Last night I used my new pot to boil water and make pasta. I hand washed it afterwards, and the bottom finish was flaking off everywhere. I am hoping that these flakes were not in our dinner! I thought the price was too good to be true and apparently it was. Save yourself the worry of toxic flakes in your food and the hassle of returning the product and buy a better pot."
3,Nice pot - misleading ad,I specifically bought this model because the Amazon ad stated it was dishwasher safe. When it arrived the packaging information says that it isn't to be put in the dishwasher (it is hard anodized). Bummer. I'm not going to return it - I do need a pot - so I guess I'll have to hand wash it now.Otherwise seems like a good deal - I just wish I had known the details before hand and I probably wouldn't have gotten it.
2,Not worth the money,"I got this to replace a soup pot that i had for years. this one seemed to look like the one i was replacing and the price was right. I have only had it a month or so and the nonstick coating is already coming off the inside bottom of the pot. Also, it is so lightweight that there is no way it is heating evenly. I do not recommend this product."
5,excellent item from a excellent maker,"Circulon is the best,you will know if you ever used one.This is no different.Strong coating which wont wear and tear like the walmart ones.Will always buy this brand!"
2,NOT CIRCULON 2,just received the dutch oven -- it is NOT CIRCULON 2 as advertised above -- haven't used it yet since I am not sure what I am going to do it
4,Good story with a bit of history thrown in,"This was an enjoyable read. Instant chemistry between the characters, good writing with some humour, action and history as well. Misgivings about the book: (a) Found that the characters' actions or what they say were not consistent with how they should be (e.g. at times Damien's actions and words were very incongruous with his tortured persona and I was very surprised with Miranda's intimate actions with Damien given her background); and (b) There are some incredulous scenes in the book (e.g. Damien defeating more than a dozen men on his own, really?).Overall an enjoyable read. It made me quite interested in the history of that period (dominated by the war with Napoleon leading up to the Battle of Waterloo)."
3,Not As Good As Her Others,"This book just draged on and on for me. I did not like the whole guardian/ward situation. Damian always felt to old for her. I found neither character very interesting. There ""romance"" seemed boring as well. I did like reading about the rest of the Knight family but that was about it for me. I found Damien just alittle to uptight and the whole situation with his ""problem"" being solved in one night alittle to farfetched. I would have have like it better if it was over a longer stretch of time. Lastly I would like to point out that the book was entirely to long with nothing to hold your interest and at the end of the book I thought it could have been cut out completly. This is not one of her better books I found Lord of Fire much much better."
5,It deserves more than 5 stars.,Wow! It's a spectacular love story. Don't miss it. That's all I can say.
1,"Waste of time, incredibly stupid","If you're reasonably intelligent, you'll be annoyed if you waste your time watching this movie. Cheesy dialog, unconvincing acting, and a ridiculous ending all ruined what could have been an awesome tale. I had hoped for a good nail-biting, tension-filled movie, perhaps with a meaningful message about nuclear weapons (either pro or con, at least something meaningful). Instead? Nothing. Just a wish that I'd spent my time doing something else. There's nothing ""deep"" about this, the only ""message"" you could possibly derive is one you add yourself -- it's not in the film. The characters are terribly inconsistent... Ugh. I could go on and on about how poor this movie is, but I can't think of anything positive to say about it -- and that is really sad, because the basic concept has so much potential."
5,It Doesn't get much better than this!,"Ok, so you say you are a real fan of Roger Taylor. It would be hard not to say that this CD is probably one of his best. It had such a kick back in 84 when it came out that I was rather surprised it didn't do better! Man on Fire, I Cried for You, It's an Illusion (Awesome Guitar Solo), Strange Frontier, Masters of War, et. al... Probably the best tracks on this disk. It's nice to see the disk finally got stateside. Roger's other Solo projects are note worthy. All-in-all, Strange Frontiers is still my favorite Roger Taylor Solo project."
4,Kerry is not perfect...,"but to hell with all of us if he isn't 1,000,000 better than King George...."
1,Highly Disappointing,"I bought this book hoping to find out who the real John Kerry is instead one is unable to know who the real John Kerry is.Two things occur after reading this book. The first is how truely arrogant he sounds. Second, glaring inconsistencies appear in relation to his service. In this book there is one account on his recent interviews on programs such as Meet the Press and Good Morning America another account."
1,The difference between Kerry and Bush is obviously clear,"Bush won. Haha! Victory is sweetest when one realizes that the left has 3 more years to fume over the outcome of last November. In desperation, please run Clinton #2--and watch her get slapped back to her, ahem, home state of New York."
2,On the downslide,"It's a bummer. Santana has just emerged from the 70's fusion movement having played with some of the best jazzmen around. However, this is an unfortunate hodge-podge or rock, disco and mediocre Latin music. This is an example of Santana's penchant for cashing in on the current trends. Don't look for Tito Puente or Miles Davis here. The only thing of value here is the Brazilian-flavoured ""Let the Children Play"" medley. I am glad they included it on the followup live album Moonflower (a temporary return to form) and thankfully, skipped the rest of this lousy album."
3,Festival by Santana,"Festival by Santana. I like Santana, latin jazz and rock. I need to get this albumn/CD to add to my collection. Good listen."
2,"Some helpful suggestions, but mostly common-sense stuff.","I found the author's information to be mostly common-sense, and not very unique. She spent 50 pages on sewing technique, which, according to the title, was not the purpose of the book. What I thought was going to be an interesting section on what to take to sewing classes was disappointing, as you would need a moving van to take everything the author suggested. Overall, I would say it was not good use of my money or my reading time, and I would (conditionally) recommend it only to very inexperienced sewing ""students."""
4,I NEED the common sense stuff!,"I am a beginning quilter and liked the ""basic"" information Myrna gave in this book. It is helping me sort through the piles of debris I have already accumulated. I can use all the help I can get."
5,This book has to be on your desk ...,"This book is excellent, specially for serious athletes, coaches and people interested in sports nutrition. It has a lot of tables and figures that explain each topic, has multiple references and updated www addresses. This book is a must have...."
2,Not as good as the MHC-GX250,"I thought this new model would be a good replacement to my old MHC-GX250 which was a bit big for my new smaller room. But I was the MHCEC70 Minisystem is truely ""Mini"" and inferior in quality to the older MHC-GX250 which was around $280 and was well worth it. This system does not deliver the 320 Watts compared to my older system which used to blow up the room. Moreover it lacks an auxilary and Game Sync, so you can't hook up your TV, IPOD or XBOX to it.."
2,Arrived with broken part...,"I didn't even plug it in, as the pump arrived with a broken front dial. Super disappointed since I was really looking forward to getting the pump installed. I guess I just received a defective one, but still, it's not a good impression. I put a 2* since I actually don't even know how good or bad the product it, guess I'll never find out..."
5,Great little pump,"I almost went with the 75 GPH version because of the price, but I'm really glad I got the 130. It's worth the extra dollars.I'm going to use this one to build a water activity table for my 1 and 5 year old children. The 75 GPH would have been a slow trickle.The pump has a nice long cord (I think it's about 10'!) and it pumps to the height it specifies. At max height, you do get just a trickle, though. At about 1/2 height it's a nice flow. I'm thinking of replacing the pump that came with one of our outdoor fountains with this beauty. Both for the flow rate, and the really long cord."
3,Old - but real stories with good plot and an ending which is unusual these days,Old - but real stories with good plot and an ending which is unusual these days - guess he really is an antithisis of an Ausie larrakin
4,Gable's other work...,"All good films, some new to DVD (""San Francisco"", ""Wife Vs. Secretary"", etc.), from Warner's MGM library. They all feature the usual great film transfers we've all come to expect from Warner Bros. However, ""Wife Vs. Secretary"" was transferred from a very poor print which was unfortunate because I found the film has an unusually good performance from Jean Harlow and has a great little story. The release of ""San Francisco"" is timely because of the 100th anniversary of the 1906 earthquake and fire. This has always been a favorite of mine. This collection is a good cross section of Gable's work and definitely deserves a first or second look!"
2,Very Disappointed,Like so many others I read the reviews on just about every parabolic heater Amazon sold. All of them seemed to have problems of one kind or another but of the many this seemed the best. What I'm most disappointed about is the amount of heat put out by this unit. I had it on the 800w setting last night at a distance of about 4 ft. from me and was certainly not overly warm. I've experienced other parabolic heaters and they sure seemed to put out a lot more heat than this Optimus. Their customer service was not a great help in giving me an idea of how much heat I should expect. The bottom line for me is that it just doesn't put out that much heat. I really out to return it
2,Don't expect this to heat up your room!,"Winter is coming! I've had this dinky little space heater for a few years, so I decided to upgrade to a dish heater, to heat up my room (approx 10x10). Sadly, I was quite disappointed. My little space heater will heat up my room in about 15 minutes. This dish heater though, I'll have it on for hours, and not even realize that it's on. The only time it's actually warm is when you're standing 1-2 feet in front of it. I was looking at the other reviews and everyone else says that their heater heats up their whole house, so maybe mine is broken, but seeing as how it's very hot up close, i don't think it's broken.So my recommendation, don't buy this heater if you want it to heat up your room, but do buy it if you are the type that likes to sit by the heater and just get temporarily warm."
5,Canon bci-24 Ink 20 pack: A great deal and an Excellent seller!,"This is a great product for your canon printer! Its also a great buy, I usually go to walmart, where black ink is $7.50 a cartridge and color is $14.50 a cartridge. I got 20 (10 black and 10 color) for under $25!!! It shipped fast, I was expecting to get it later this week or early next week, but it came today!Excellent seller, I will certainly continue to purchase my ink online from Abacus 24-7! Such a great seller, fast shipping and high quality ink! Thanks for much!!!"
5,Grow Colt,this product works very well for a rescued foal i got that was very thin and wasnt getting fed. now that hes on this grow colt pellet his coat is starting to get shiney and hes starting to put on weight. these crumbs also give him energy that he didnt have to enjoy his day! :)
4,Works nice,"I've tried tons and tons of hair products to both straighten and refine my curls. Very few do what they promise, but this one does -- pretty much."
4,Great Quality,"A little larger and heavier than I expected, but a solid home Pilates reformer. As someone who has been taking classes in a Pilates studio with professional-grade reformers, this comes as close as possible -- and for about 10% of the price of a studio-quality reformer.It's versatile, easy to use (once you figure out the sparse instructions on how to set it up) and the cords provide some serious resistance and a good, thorough workout.The one complaint I have is that the wheels don't seem to be in the proper position to actually function. Then again, if the manual weren't so minimalist, I might have been able to figure out what, if anything, I'm doing wrong."
4,Not what I was expecting,"This was a gift and I was pretty surprised to hear techno like music instead of lyrics. Nonetheless, the kids seem to love it and always want to dance when it is on."
4,magnetic appeal,"Don't be scared by the references to this being a Magnetic Fields ""country"" album. Not at all. It's only ""country"" in the sense that the music evokes rural highways and wide open places. Other than that, you aren't going to find any banjos, peddle steel guitar or hillbilly yodeling ... so relax. But once again, Stephin Merritt displays his knack for composing crafty songs with hooks and subtle layers of melody. Like previous Magnetic Fields albums, the more you play it, the better it all sounds. Addictive tunes once again. I honestly can't say it's my favorite of the MF albums that I've heard so far, but there is no denying that it's a mighty good one. Magnetic Fields fans need to have this one in their collection."
5,VERY REALISTIC,I found this a very enjoyable read. It seems very realistic and does not make it sound like a Chuck Norris movie. I believed what I was being told. Good book.
1,One star too many for a rating,"A major disappointment. Collaborating with a ""bunch"" of hip-hop stars does not necessarily translates to or guarantee hits. Next Millenium is a testament to that. Bounty seemed to struggle to stay on track and his flow does not appear to come across naturally. This will neither appeal to a hip-hop audience nor to his traditional dancehall audience. Bounty's true talent did not get a chance to shine - it was buried in the sea of hip-hop beats and big willie rap stars. The Killer is missing (assumed dead) in action on this one."
2,Not Worth The Money!!!,"As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy. The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!!"
2,blah,"a step backwards from ""Cor-Crane Secret"", this one still has the same queasy guitar sounds but few of the songs have the same quality of screwed-up melody, clever arrangements, and sheer listenability that made that album work so well. Although this album has plenty of great ideas, the combination of melody and experimentation rarely gels in a very satisfying manner. Plus, a lot of the instrumentation is extremely sloppy, like they didn't even practice before recording it. Like all their albums following ""Cor-Crane Secret"", this one has a couple of good songs but never really makes it far beyond mediocre."
5,Looking for a bedtime solution,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this album. I periodically keep my 5 month old granddaughter overnight and was looking for something that I could use to rock her to sleep. The instrumentals on the album are extremely soothing, and the melodies flow seamlessly from one to the next. By the time the album ends, my granddaughter is in a deep sleep for the night and I am totally relaxed, too. This bedtime ritual has been so successful that I am ordering copies of the CD as gifts to new parents. I recommend it to others who are looking for an alternative to lullabies that can be sing-song rather than soothing."
4,Fast delivery!,I sent to my parents living in outside New York so I haven't really see it but they are very happy.
1,Not for the average geoscientist,"This book has many negatives but a few positives. First, unless you are very comfortable with ODE's and PDE's, read another book. Second, there is next to nothing new in its' pages.And lastly, there is nothing in this book that one can take to the project and begin to use; None of the ODE's and PDE's are expanded.On the positive side, when one reads a section and recognizes the topic, one becomes hopeful. But that's as far as it goes.However, the other books from the IAMG are worth the price of the book."
1,Are you kidding me?,"This is undoubtedly the worst book I've read in my entire life. I was shocked at the poor writing, the flimsy plotline, and the one-dimensional characters. Always wanting to give every writer (and book) the benefit of the doubt, though, I kept reading with hope that there would be redemption in the book's progression. No such luck. There are plenty of books on the market with not-so-serious subjects that are worth reading because they are cleverly devised and written; this is certainly not one of them."
3,Not the best Chick Lit out there,"Hmmm, what can I say?? A married,attractive woman goes on a reality showlike The Bachelor. She is supposed towrite a story about the behind the scenesgoings on. I am not a fan of this show, so perhaps I have a jaded view. Thebook was interesting, but not exactly apage turner. Predictable, but alsounplausible. I would hope that the womenon these shows are screened morethoroughly. Fresh idea, but not verythought provoking."
4,An OK cutting board,"Price is good, but size is kinda tiny. If you just cook for yourself or no more than 3 people, you can consider it."
4,sounds like stepping on a cat,"Hello 1990's this is the future. I miss you and all your jingle-jangly bands from Chapel Hill North Carolina, Gainsville Florida, and Athens Georgia. This is a must own for any Polvo or 90's indie rock music enthusiast. Plenty of mathy-rockin psychedelic guitar alternating with Middle Eastern-style influenced drone."
4,Polvo is a great Chapel Hill band and truly unique.,"I've just recently found out about Polvo from my brother. This album is definitely great for a night of friends just chillin'. They are kind of acquired taste, but if you like the Chapel Hill music scene- you'll love Polvo. Merge rocks!"
2,Disappointed with its factional tendencies-boogie or exotica,"While Cor-Crane Secret is considered to be this band's ""prettiest"" ""pop"" album, it is also Polvo's most exquisitely layered, conceptually complete and satisfyingly complex album. Luckily, it was the first one I picked up as Shapes was the second. Shapes was a disappointment because of its disparate, splintered feel that seemed to foretell the band's impending breakup. The beautifully structured songs of the past seemed to disappear with the band's chemistry. I went to see Polvo on their Shapes tour and was surprised at how bad the show was. It was a sad and embarassing thing to see Ashe Bowie reluctantly partake of the other band members' plain awful boogie-woogie prog-rock tendencies partially showcased on Shapes. No wonder he opted for what I am guessing were his otherworldly introspective pieces of ephemera. Who would want to be there while the other dudes are kicking out the tired retro jams?"
5,Great Karaoke CD for kids of all ages.,"I got this CD for my 5 year old granddaughter because I wanted her to know some of the Sunday school songs that I grew up singing. It's a fun way to let kids of all ages know or remember Jesus loves us all. My personal favorite was ""This Little Light Of Mine, I'm Gonna Let It Shine""."
3,Over House,"This CD is great but so is 'TRAX 20TH Anniversary'. These two CD box sets are the same except for CD 1 and CD 4 of the Ultimate House Sessions CD. Learnig that I had purchased the basically the same music under different names was very disturbing. The only thing that settled the dismay was knowing the music was of great quality, two disk were diferent out of the total eight purchased, and the fact that I could should the extra disk with another House head. My advice is to reveiw the song titles before you buy especially if the DJ's are the same."
2,Never Use,"If you have a computer or TV with cable or a dish you'll find no use for this. I find it useless and fustrating, I have to come up to it very close to read it because of its glare."
4,"Good info, but I don't think ecology is a real science.","This is a decent textbook as an introduction to ecology. It contains alot of good information and integrates quite a bit of mathematics and graphs into the material being presented. However, I am convinced that ecology is not a real science."
1,I guess racism against white people is OK,"It wasn't long ago that I despised ""racism"", which I felt meant oppression, exclusion and generally dislike of peoples with different skin color attributes.It took me a while to realize that in the world of uber-Politically Correct Leftist activism, ""racism"" basically translates to ""evil white people putting everyone down"".A few days ago one of my Latino college professors referred to me as a ""Anglo Saxon"". I'm not sure if she knows this, but it is a known fact that Anglo Saxons are actually one ethnic group of caucasians among many, and I myself am Slavic. Can I play the race card too and become a victim? It sure looks fun"
1,The hypocrisy of political correctness,"When bell hooks tells her readers how she is sitting next to a white man she longs to kill, I wonder does she realize how this would have played if a white man or woman wrote the same thing about a black? This comment provoked no outrage whatsoever.The only ""killing rage"" here is the lack of rage at her clear manifestation of hate due to political correctness.White, capitalist, patriarchy, yada, yada, yada ad nauseum and ad infinitum. This book is utterly worthless. And this comes from a black man."
1,The Complete Second Season disc 1 and 2 are the same,"I bought this pack and took a nasty disappointment because the second season is wrong from factory, apparently there are four disks as there are four hard prints numbered 1 to 4 in different colors but here's the surprise when you play the DVDs happens:The labeled as 1 DVD contains the chapters of the DVD 2. (Poor)The labeled as 2 DVD contains the chapters of the DVD 2. (Good)The labeled as 3 DVD contains the chapters of the DVD 3. (Good)The labeled as 4 DVD contains the chapters of the DVD 1. (Poor)In short, missing DVD 4, despite being badly printed, which is not ideal for what you pay, missing six chapters and that's what I cannot accept, I hope the seller fix this as I have to pay extra for sending and returning goods.Hope this does not happen with other seasons as I did not review them all."
5,AMAZING!,"I just finished reading this book today, I am about to head on down to boot camp myself this summer and wanted to just get a little taste of what its going to be like in the crucible, this is a non-stop action packed book, it was so hard to put down, and usually I can't keep intrest in books. This told you the story of young men making their way to becoming a United States Marine. I recommend this for anyone who is joing or has joined or just anyone wanting to read an amazing book, it will give you a whole respect for what the USMC is all about.Semper Fi"
4,"Great Book, But now Outdated","I bought this book way back in 2006 right before I went to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. I simply wanted a look into what to expect because the only people I could ask where my recruiters and they basically said anything they wanted at that time to get me to stay committed to an enlistment. At the time it was a great resource for people wanting to become Marines. It is still mostly largely relevant, however the Crucible itself is an ever changing and evolving event. Most of the same principles stay the same so I would completely recommend this book, just not tell someone to solely rely on it. It would get 5 stars but I gave it 4 because of its dated nature."
5,Great book to prepare yourself emotionally for adopting a toddler,The best way to prepare yourself for adopting a toddler is with your eyes and heart wide open. The book does a great job of relaying the experiences of others who have adopted toddlers - the joys and the heartaches. I thought the book did a good job of setting expectations for future parents at just the right level. The book also reminds us that children experience the trauma of being separated from their birth parents differently and that parents need to be flexible and adapt to their children's own unique personalities and situation. A wonderful read for anyone considering toddler adoption.
1,Caution: Intrusive Methods,"The author is an advocate of ""Attachment Therapy,"" promoting coercive Holding Therapy and forced age regression (i.e. ""reparenting"") of toddlers. These practices are potential highly abusive and unethical.Hopkins-Best also teaches that children form attachments to adults by a process called the ""attachment cycle,"" a bogus concept invented by the infamous Foster Cline.It is disturbing to think that the author is a professor (U of Wisconsin-Stout) and promoting as valid these abusive practices and nonsense ideas to students."
3,dvd have no content bummer!!,I received my equipment which by the way is very heavy. But it is whatiwanted and I like it BUT the DVD's do not work. I even borrowed a friends Dvd playerAnd still no content. This is agrivating because I'm not certain of the exercisesAvaliable. The Stamina1-800 # is open Mon- Fri during my working hours so noHelp on the weekend. This left me disappointed in the product i paid premium price forFyi. I usually send favorable reviews
1,Jumping the Shark,"I am a big fan, but this is where Neil jumps the shark. The Song Sung Blue part of this concert is so bad it is funny; Las Vegas did not become Neil. Gold was the first concert album and the best; his voice wasn't shot yet. Hot August Night has great moments, but LATG just has cringe moments."
1,All Greek To Me,This CD captures the man and his music perfectly. This should be placed in your favorite infectious waste bin.
2,Text-to-Speech NOT ENABLED for Kindle,Text-to-Speech NOT ENABLED for Kindle If I had known this I would not have purchased this. At least I now know not to purchase the other Foundation books on Kindle.
2,Here's where I . . .,". . . stopped. Asimov proceeds from an excellent 1950s trilogy into the 1980s world of contract authorship and has to produce 350,000 words in a story that needed only 1/3 as many. Additionally, he becomes an unabashed purveyor for the Gaia (Mother Earth) myth, selling his soul and his intellect. Who knows, maybe his 1948 short story ""Mother Earth"" was a portent. Disappointed."
4,"Very good pump, bad hose connections","Good pump for small projects, has great water push power. One big problem with this pump is the connectors and adapters are cheap plastic and dont stay in the connector hole. I had to jerry rig mine to work but it was still worth the money...."
2,Not strong enough,"We ordered this for our fountain of about 3.5 feet tall. After we installed it, we found it too weak to create effective flow even though it says 4.5 feet. We are going to return this one and try the 320GPH unit. I would suggest users account for about 50% of the maximum lift rating based on what we saw."
4,He's right up there......,"I first heard L.D. back in the 70's,""Old Judge Jones"" got some air play on Detroit's progressive FM stations, and I bought the vinyl, to my surprise the entire LP was very good (I don't throw the word great around too often). Les is very flavorful in his guitar phrasing, he can sing, play bass, and can write, ( he co-wrote ""Jessica"" with the Allmans). I played the ""Say no more"" CD a few days ago and I still ""get off"" on ""One to Beam Up"" and ""Zorro Rides Again"" two KICK-ASS instrumentals. Like other fans, I'm begging Sony to release ALL Les Dudek material (you guys will make your money back). I have every thing he's done on vinyl, including the ""D.F.K. Band"" , but the vinyl's wearing thin. If you like rock & roll guitar, well written songs, and very good productions, grab all the Les Dudek stuff you can find you won't be disappointed. Check out Les in the movie ""Mask"", with Cher and Sam Elliot, he played a biker named ""Bone"""
1,Unworthy Fantacy,"I couldn't stand to read this book but had to read it for school. It was very predictible and it screams, ""I'm copying Harry Potter!"" An extremely horrid book."
3,i was there !!,"On the LP theres a blurb about a concert in Kansas City about a tornado coming through....santana, and the little river band were there..they told us folks in nosebleed to get to ground level..after the power came back on..(lightning) reo (of course) played riding the storm out...it was a total trip for a kid with not a lot of concert experience.."
5,RICHRATH RULES!,"I just listened to this cd and was quite impressed. The sound quality is terrific and very well recorded.While G. Richrath is deservedly in the spotlight, I was amazed at how well Kevin Cronin's rhythm guitar sounded.The rest of the band is spot on, with special kudos to Neal Doughty on keyboards.There were a number of songs I had never heard before, but after listening to them, there will be no need to skipany of them when playing them again. It's just a fun live rock 'n roll album (originally a two album set) from thelate '70s that deserves to be heard. Remastered in 1990, but sounds as good as some remastered much later."
3,"Okay, but not Korman's best","I was very excited to hear Gordon Korman had a new book out, being a big fan of his other books, but this one just doesn't live up to the standards. It just doesn't make you burst out laughing like his other books, and you couldn't really get a sense of any of the characters besides Cassandra, Mr.Hughes and Snoopy. Not a bad story, and it had some funny moments, but if you want Korman at his best, try ""I Want to Go Home"" or any of the Bruno and Boots books."
