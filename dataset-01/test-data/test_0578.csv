1,Santa Claus 2,"Santa Claus 2, Could not play it, It said it was the wrong format.Need a return lable. Marion Merritt 1537 West 205th Street Torrance CA. 90501"
4,a good starting place,"I hadn't really expected it to be just a list of internet addresses but even so I was quite pleasantly suprised. Even my 13 year old computer whiz kid son was fairly impressed - not that he would admit to it! nd it's not just for kids either - I found a few sites that I was interested in - mind you, I'm a big kid at heart!"
1,Why pay when you can get it free????,"This book is offered for FREE from any Jehovahs Witness. If you are interested in this book, ask any Jehovahs Witness and they will GIVE it to you!"
5,modernart,recieved it quickly and in good condition. perfect for my class. the book is definatly old but being a college student on a budget it is just right for the class and has perfect timing to do my class work.
3,The Title Says It All,"Due to incredible pressure from their record label, Lynyrd Skynyrd was in a big time rush to record and release this record. The title seems to come from the attitude the band members took in writing and recording this music. Truthfully quality wise the music also rates the same as the attitude.Don't get me wrong, these songs are certainly very listenable. And Saturday Night Special, Whiskey Rock N Roller, and On The Hunt have many catchy elements about them. However, when compared to their previous songs, the effort is a little substandard. That little extra hook that was present in such gems as Sweet Home Alabama, The Ballad Of Curtis Lowe, Gimmee Three Steps, and Freebird is missing in this batch of Skynyrd tunes. I will admit the guitar soloing is pretty first rate, the drumming much improved, and Ronnie Van Zandt's vocals are just as expressive as on prior recordings.Nonetheless, this CD rates as a good one rather than a great one."
4,OK if you need some of these songs :-l,"The main reason I love this, is because there are some good songs all on the one cd, and a fair few of them I didn't buy yet, because I don't think I really love the artists, but one individual song of theirs is OK. For example, Hanging By A Moment. I don't know why I never bought it as a single, but here it is along with other great songs I don't own (Again by Lenny Kravitz). Other than that, there are too many other songs, that got so much airplay, you don't want to hear them again ever. I personally found this mix good for me, but make up your own mind. I do have to say it is a good variety."
4,Renews my Spirit,"I was driving along one day and heard this song and new I just had to have it. I bought the CD for my mother because I felt it would help her in her current situation. I haven't listened to the entire CD, but I love the song ""I Trust God"". It blesses me everytime and reminds me to trust Him because He is truly in control."
5,Our dogs love them,"We've been buying hooves at Costco (when they had them) and Petsmart.The problem with the Petsmart ones we bought the last two times is that when the dogs were chewing on them, the hooves admitted a horrible stench. We thought that the dogs were passing gas.No such problem with these. In fact, the only problem with these hooves are the same with any hooves we've bought. Give one to each of four dogs and one dog ends up with four, chewing on one and guarding the rest. LOLI believe I paid a whole lot less for this box of 30 than I paid for a few at Petsmart."
3,"Not bad, but it could be much better","The images are fine, but I think this atlas lacks of a little bit of explaining text. Not bad, but I expected much more."
4,Another Excello Gem,"This is an excellent collection of raw blues from a vastly underated artist. Lightnin' Slim (and other Excello artist for that matter) is as authnetic as Lousianna swamp blues gets. This is the stuff that paved the way for bands like Credence Clearwater Revival. The Excello label never got the recognition it deserved. If it weren't for Excello, Sun Records might not have been half the success that it was. If you like this album, check out Lazy Lester and Slim Harpo."
3,frustrating combination of good and bad,"Frank Brady's ""Profile of a Prodigy"" is a frustrating combination of good and bad. The good first: Brady gives fascinating behind-the-scenes information that I'd read nowhere else, giving you the sense that you are there. The bad: the book is riddled with mistakes, stuff you wouldn't find in a High School newspaper! Dates and misstatements of facts, too numerous to mention. And some chessic misjudgements too, like when Brady says, speaking of the 1972 Title Match, that Fischer varied his opening repertoire to an English Opening in Game 8 from the QGD of Game 6. But it wasn't Fischer who varied; he played 1.c4 in both games. It was Spassky's reply in game 8 that changed the opening. The book would've benefitted from a good editor, one who knows how to play chess. But despite all this, I'd still recommend the book. It's a fascinating read.Bob Hunt, Hillsborough, N.J."
3,Looks like a piece of dated political propaganda,"Even though Bobby's chess prowess was the main reason for my interest in chess, and taking into account the significance of his direct attack on USSR's chess supremacy, I just can't bear the hysterical political overtone that dominates the text. Even if Bobby commended Brady a self-indulgent bio, I can imagine his face while reading such display of hystrionics. You get 90 well-annotaded games, but then you must skip the bio section..."
5,I launched the trip of my life -- around the world cheap!,"If you're short on ideas of how to afford to travel (and you've got just a little gumption) you can't miss finding a way to make it happen with this book. It's packed with accurate information that can help you transform your imagination into an affordable plan, then go! I did it and I'll never be the same again... As Bruce says -- you can leave the rat race for awhile -- it WILL be here when you get back. You just don't feel so much like a rat any more!"
3,"Great book, just out-of-date","This travel guide book is a great read before bouncing around the world for the first time, and the resources in the back of the book would be an incredible reference except that it's so outdated that phone numbers and companies no longer exist and no websites are listed! Otherwise it's a great read and reference before traveling."
4,Nice cymbal for * Beginners *,"If this is going to be one of your first Cymbals, go ahead. But if you want to purchase this cymbal for his low price I recommend you to get more powerful cymbals (like AA series) and pay a little more."
1,Terrible Trailer,How do you expect anyone to buy or PPV any of your movieswhen the trailers are SO BAD?
2,Too superficial,"provide basics for various topics: bond pricing, college level economics (macroecon), physcho, ...BUT neither is specific and in-depth.Personally I don't think it is enough for traders, nor for quant/quant developpers.A bad buy for my personal bookshelf."
2,Works... for a little bit,"For maybe a couples months this worked great, but then the sound quality became horrible, cracking, not full volume, and the device had to be held just right for good sound. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra to get a quality cable"
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,I bought this cable to hook up a radio to my PC so that I can delay the radio broadcast of sporting events. It does what it is supposed to do.
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"this is my favorite CD of all time! i played it for all of my friends, and even though they hadnt ever heard of most of the songs they fell in love with them! the songs are deep and pleasant to listen to, as well as very cleverly written. in ""letters"", there is a lot of rhyming in the lines:leaving me here dear alone with all my wrongs/your pulling away, pray your making the right choicei would heartily recommend this CD to anyone who likes pop rock and rock"
2,ok now i have listened to the entire cd!,"This album gets only 2 stars from me. However, the band shows lots of promise. here are the positives that i see. positives- the singer doesn't ever whine or shriek like the matchbox 20 guy or smashing pumpkins guy. the bassist, drummer, and guitarist play very sharply. i like how everything sounds as a whole coming from the instruments. negatives- the song writing is horrible. they need song writers. they have talent but have only shown it on a few songs of this album namely the first 5 tracks. not only are the lyrics silly most of the time, but there are not enough melodies with the bassist or the lead singers. the band should try to keep it simple. the article here that compares this band to r.e.m. or live is silly. i like bands like r.e.m., radiohead, cranberries, stabbing westward, nirvana...even third eye blind...but this band needs to stop and write more great tunes like the third track of this album."
4,"Buy it for Backpack, keep it for the rest of the songs","I saw these guys live, most fun you can have at a show. Bought the cd to hear backpack, but end up skipping song on cd to hear other songs, they get 5 stars if they better capture live energy"
4,they definitely have some engery,"Had never heard of them, or any of their songs when I picked up this CD. I believe the CD was listed as alternative...more like alternative with POP influence. They definitely have some infectious tunes that will get caught in your head. Solid music and lyrics that will stay in your head long after you've changed CDs. A welcome new face on the music scene."
3,"Add Another Star for Enjoyability Factor, I Guess","Epitome of light, fun poppy-rock album that doesn't take itself too seriously."
1,This music should be taken off the shelves,"Have any of you who ""love"" this album ever listened to the words? Are your parents listening to this with you? This is one of the WORST groups I have ever heard. Their music may have a good beat, but the lyrics need to be re-examined. Who wants to listen to that? Especially, Little Black Backpack. That song is an extremely violent song. If bands can make it to the airwaves with this music (where is the FCC? ), it's no wonder our youth is beating up each other and committing serious acts of violence. I do not recommend that this album stay on the shelves. Someone has to stand up to these people and do what's right. And selling this album to kids? That's insane. I had to give it 1 star, but if i could, I would have given it minus. This album should be removed from stores and the radios. It's not for our young at heart. I give it two thumbs down."
2,Slightly disappointing,"This album was OK, but I was expecting better. If you like ""Little Black Backpack,"" my advice would be to either buy the single or listen carefully to the music samples of this CD before you buy it. I didn't find most of the songs very catchy, and ""Backpack"" is by far the best song on the album. Most of the music is mellow, and a little too ""twangy"" for my taste. However, if you liked Semisonic's ""Feeling Strangely Fine"" (another diappointment in my opinion), you might like this album."
3,Its a average cordless phone,The voice enhancer makes the call vibrate and the sound is poor better without enhancer To retrieve missed calls while you were out could have been designed better. no adjustment for back light stays on a few seconds. those were the cons. The pros are easy to save names and phone numbers for redialing holds 50 names with the digital sound clear crisp sound without static
5,so far so good,"i like this phone. i took the risk and bought it despite the not-s-good reviews, but it's been great so far. i've always had good results with panasonic.plus, it's a pretty color!"
2,PYSCHO RETURNS FOR REVENGE.,"i first saw this movie back in high school when it first came out and thought it was a crappy, low budget horror flick which it is and didn't think I would ever see again , but for some reason I purchased it through amazon and have to agree with some of the amazon reviewers that this comes across as somewhat of a "" HALLOWEEN"" ripoff that centers on this kid with a chain- smoking , uncaring mother who resents him and neighborhood bullies who harass him and cause him to fall into a well where He's disfigured and committed to a mental institution for some ten years before escaping to return to his hometown to seek revenge on those who crossed him."
2,2 and a half stars,"This Halloween rip-off offers a weird plot.A boy gets pushed down a well and grows up and kills the kids(now teens) that pushed him. The reason this copies HALLOWEEN is because the music it sounds very similar and how the killer escaped from the mental hospital just like Michael Myers did. The death scenes were laughable(a teen gets his head squeezed,another gets shot with a rifle) and the acting was horrid. The reason this gets 2 and a half stars is because the stupid sheriff gets told off by a little kid. A watchable if routine horror flick."
4,Great book for new big sisters!,"I have purchased this book for two of my friends' children. They love it! One of them has been asking for this book over others. The story is very cute, and easy for two- or three-year-olds to understand."
4,Good book,"A good book for my 2 year old. Even though it depicted bottle-feeding and we are breastfeeding family, I still think its a good book. It shows the little girl helping bottle feed the baby and we've hardly mastered bottle feeding yet but eventually that could be something she could help with."
5,Perfect,"I wanted to play Bioshock 2 and also love up it's online play, so I picked this up recently so that I could play the first one first. I always wondered what the hubbub was about, and I gotta say, DANG! Rarely have I played a game that accomplished so much. I can't see a single problem with this creative gem, so I'll keep it short and sweet. For shooter fans who love a great story, this is unique and out of this world. A perfect game in every way."
2,RENT this awesome game.,"This game was so much fun. The visuals were stunning. The music and genre felt like an epic 1920's storyline. These new plasmid type weapons that eradicate enemies from your left arm are too cool !!!!!!! Then the game is over. Just as fast as it started and swallowed me into this underwater world, it was over. Well I beat it in 2 days. There is no reason I had to waste $50-60 just to beat it in 2 days. I read an article were the game creator is talking about releasing new plasmids for xbox live download. Would I actually play this game all the way through again just cause I have some new plasmids? NO WAY! I will never put this game in the xbox again. Once I beat a game its done. It is never the same again. It loses its grandeur. It also has no multiplayer so the replay value is absolutely ZERO.Summary: This is probably the coolest game you will play this year. Save your money and rent it."
1,OVERRATED!!!!,this game is over hyped. the game play is too simplistic. sure the graphics is amazing but really the A.I is dumb found.
4,"Innovative, Immersive but short on length of gameplay","I agree with most of the reviewers here, in that this game has all the elements of a very good (not great) FPS-RPG combo game. The story line is very engaging, the use of the environment and different weapons/plasmids during combat makes the game a lot of fun and the game is a visual treat. People have likened the story to some of Ayn Rand's work and well I can't complain, after all who doesnt like feeling part of something more sinister and complex than a mere run and gun video game? However I feel that the lack of Multiplayer and co-op limit the game's appeal atleast from a financial standpoint. Is the game worth 59.99, the same amount we are charged for Halo 3 or Mass effect. I think not. Also the gameplay is rather easy due to the ability to regenerate onself in a Vita-chamber while your opponents health stays static. Overall, the game is a lot of fun and would be a better value if it was priced at say 49.99."
5,Great game!,"Great game. I just got the XBOX Elite and hooked up to my new HD LCD 37"" at 720P...This game is amazing! Reminds me of the first time I played Halflife on my PC!! The graphics and sound is top notch and the video ""Acting"" (voices, etc) is terrific. I always appreciate getting my moneys worth, and this game was worth every penny! I am anticipating Halo 3 but I cannot imagine that game topping this one."
5,"Totally addictive and engrossing, love it!!","I'm really grateful for the reviews because I wasn't aware of this game.I searched for games with 4 stars and that's how I found it.When I started playing it I couldn't stop, the story had me hypnotized, the graphics are mesmerizing and the unique take on weapons was refreshing.After finishing this game I immediately bought Bioshock2 which is just as addictive and fun.I'm keeping both of them and looking forward to the next installment."
4,Bio Shock FPS,"I have just started playing Bioshock, (on easy) and so far it's an excellent game. I've played all three Halo games and would rate the Halo series the ultimate FPS. Bioshock is deffinately a FPS, but adds puzzels, that are basically easy, to gain some extra credits in the game for ammo, food, etc. and in my opinion gives the player a chance to do a little thinking while in the course of the game. I'm playing Bioshock on a 60"" screen and the details and sound are truely spectacular. I got the X-Box 360 game over the PS3 game because it was selling for less. The game does use some foul language, so just be advised."
5,A bit creepy but otherwise classic,"I forgot to mention in my Bioshock 2 review how distressing the gameplay can be at times but it makes up for it with an awesome storyline. The same was true with Bioshock 1. Truly a classic, if you can make it through the horror this game is worth having if you haven't played it already."
3,"Decent,...but I wouldn't use it alone","Lonely Planet is a great book, and it provides great advice, help on eateries, lodging, etc. I also got the Rick Steve's Italy book...and that has better advice, and it narrows down certain spots in each area to focus on. Lonely planet gives a little bit more history, but Rick Steve's Italy tells you the walking tours you should take, and narrows down 3 hotels rather than list all 10 that are okay in the neighborhood."
4,italy,"wonderful book! So many details on traveling Italy; where to dine, sleep, visit. Easy format and organized book. Excellent choice!"
1,Disappointing,"This is the first time I've been disappointed with a Lonely Planet publication. I found this guide to Italy superficial and not helpful. It didn't contain information about some quite large towns, information about reaching destinations in scant and maps are not easy to read. And I preferred it when Lonely Planet put all the general information in the front of the book followed by the specifics region by region."
2,Shipping thru USPS is UNSAT,"I have yet to receive this item. Shipping through USPS is UNSAT, I ordered five items total and yet to receive this item plus two other items. Is has been at least 4 weeks since I placed the ordered and payment was rendered almost instantly. I will be looking to Amazon dot com as a last resort for future purchases. Thanks."
4,Reliable Lonely Planet,"I have lots of Lonely Planet travel books and they are pretty darn good. Between Let's Go and Lonely Planet they are the only books I sue when I travel. I haven't found any yet, but I'm sure some inconsistencies or inaccurate information exists, but that's the nature of these books. They right a book on something that is ever changing. Rates, locations, restaurants, shows, hotels, etc are always changing."
2,Kindle version difficult to navigate--not user friendly,"This is a large volume of information lacking an index and detailed table of contents. As a result, it is difficult to find specific details such as cities, and points of interest quickly. One can only imagine being on a noisy and busy Italian city trying to find a location by flipping from page to page in a massive volume and trying to cross reference a map at the same time. This is basically a down load of the book and not an interactive user friendly e-guide.In typical Lonely Planet fashion, the maps are hard to read and the points of interest in the chapters are not cross referenced to the map.In short, buy the book--not the electronic version."
2,"Great info, but not in electronic format!","I purchased this book for my Kindle app on my iPad and, while there is very interesting information, it is virtually unreadable on the Kindle app for the iPad!There are a lot of informative links that provide detailed information, but you can't get back to where you were once you've clicked on a link! Save yourself the hassle and buy this in printed format rather than electronic."
1,"Italy, lonely planet",From all the countries I have been driving around after these books... this is the least informative.I would not have bought it again.
2,Not Really Very Helpful,"I paged through this dutifully after a breakup and found it to be cliched and unhelpful. The tone of the book reminded me of all the platitudes the happily married give to the freshly divorced. A touch superior and with this whiff of ""If you cannot be happy being alone you must FIX that."" I think the best advice for someone who is unhappy being alone is to give them advice on how to find other people to hang out with.I think the author is hung up in a tautology.People who want to be alone are generally happy to be that way and are not going to get this kind of book. People who are unhappy being alone probably need to be with other people and being given little things to help them dilly-dally solo is going to let more time pass before they find what they really want - which is human company."
4,Nice Slipcover,The material is very nice. It also looks very good. Price is little too high but completely worth it.
1,"""Who am I, Lord?"" indeed.","""Who am I, Lord?"" indeed. I think George Rekers isn't at all sure who he is. With the help of his rent boy, however, he did discover his ""spiritual gift"" and where the rent boy wants him to use it."
1,poor,Do not order from Target. They have very poor customer service. Had ordered the item and was promised to have by december 18th. Now am told it will be another 6wks but they have no explanation for why the delay.
3,Could be built better..but still good,"We bought this for our 3yr old son for Christmas(2010) and I was disappointed in the quality of this product. We bought his twin sister a 3 wheel Dora scooter also and it is way better built and 1/2 the price! Did our little boy love it yes! and still does, but we have allowed him to use it inside and kept it out of the weather. Nothing has broke on it. I feel you are paying just for the look of it not durability"
5,Awesome product,The harddisk really works well once you plug it on to you computer.It is compatible to all the computers that i used which is very important for me.It is also light and portable and would be ideal for the computer student.I feel that i got value for my money.
4,320 Hard Drive,What can I say it seems to be working just fine. The price I paid for 320GB is amazing. I purchased alot of Iomega products over the years and they have all done their job.
3,Where's the software,"Actually the drive is fine. It works as exoected, was easy to install. etc. The problem is that I was expecting backup/restore software with it, since several years ago in a previous hard drive purchase I did receive the software. Now with MS Vista installed I needed an updated copy. I now understand that Iomega refers you to a third party site and you need to make a separate purchase. The may be the standard process today but I was not expecting to spend the additional $$."
5,"Left Brain, Right Brain","Right from the start, this book fascinated me. The authors write in a clear and concise manner that is both easy to understand and interesting; it's simply filled with data and concepts and I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in neuroscience."
2,Amateur and Cliche,"I read this book from beginning to end. It was full of spelling, grammar and factual mistakes. Every ten pages Stephen Vale literally catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror and exclaims, ""Who am I?"", a ridiculous and self indulgent question which is never, ever answered.Requiem for a Soul is a cliche portrait of a GREAT ARTIST who through an equally cliche 'roadtrip' experiences a comic book sequence of 'insights' toward self-discovery."
4,"Great read, albeit depressing","The plot summary for this book has already been explained by other reviewers, so I won't bother with that here. This book was required for a seminar I took in college about nuclear proliferation. Despite several presentations by professors studying nuclear proliferation, this book produced the most conversation (and an intelligent one, at that) surrounding the topic.While a great read, this book is rather depressing. It paints a rather bleak picture about humanity and outlines how simple it would be for humanity to be annihilated. I knocked off one star not for this reason, but simply because the book was not mind-blowing - it was great, but not fantastic."
5,Wooden,"I bought this book for my student/athlete son. I had him read the book and find five things that he could immediately apply to his life. The book is written in such a manner that the parallels between sports and life are seamlessly interwoven. By using sports as a platform of relativity, I feel I am raising my son to be a confident and responsible man. This is a must-read for fathers and sons."
5,The Wizard,"This is one of my favorite books of tidbits. Basically coach Wooden gives his ideas on life, hard work, sports and manners. Through different stories of his life and experiences.It really was a pleasure reading this book and I feel that the philosophy of coach wooden, based on hard work, trust, learning and being a good person is straight forward and a throw back to simpler values."
3,"Wooden is interesting, this book was not.","The book is set up as a series of quotes. The message gets through, but it reads like a bunch of 50-200 word excerpts from longer works that are cut and pasted together. I guess I was looking for more of the story of what Wooden did, not excerpts from after-dinner speeches."
4,"Great for beginners, and advanced users, too!","I bought this book for my mom and dad, who just recently had their very own notebook computer. The text is easy to read and not intimidating, and it is also a good read for advanced users who want to step back a bit to cover the basics of a laptop."
3,Too much unhappiness,"I recently bought these books to read aloud to my 9-year-old.We have always loved reading Roald Dahl. The story begins with the death of the parents and the children must go live with a physically as well as psychologically abusive uncle who makes then live in constant fear of their lives.There are 3 children and one of them is a baby. At one point in the story, the uncle has the baby secretly taken from his brother and sister and threatens to drop the baby from a high tower. It feels a little too real.Although, this book has an enjoyable writing style, I would not recommend it for a child of nine. It is far too negative and vividly written. I say wait until 11 or so..."
5,The Best,"These Books are great. Lemony Snicket puts so much effort into it. When you read these books it makes you just want to keep reading. If you pick the book up after dinner you'll find yourself reading the last page at midnight and your parents are in bed yelling at you to go to sleep. These books are just addictive and non predictive. Even though the story is sad, its filled with excitment. In the story there parents die so the three children go to live with a relative, Count Olaf, they have never heard of. But Count olaf just wants the childrens money. Throughout the storys Count Olaf just keeps poping up somewhere trying to get the money and kill the children. Some say it is to sad for 8 and 9 year olds but it isnt that sad. So really this book is a must read!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, But Not Like The Movie","Everyone knows that these books are kids books, but no one knows how much so. The movie makes them appear as readable as Harry Potter, but they're not. The Lemony Snicket books are strictly for kids. It's not because the author isn't as able to write a book readable for adults as Rowling. Instead, these books are intended only for children while Harry Potter is intended for everybody.The biggest disappointment for me is that Count Olaf isn't funny in the books. He's a serious character who never cracks a joke. These books aren't meant for laughs like the movie is.On the other hand, they are great for children because not only do children like them, they are somewhat educational. Throughout the books, Handler will pause and explain a concept or a word that the readers (children) don't understand. So, if you buy these books, buy them for your children."
4,Good books,"These are pretty good books. Not the best, though. I am re-reading them at school. So...though not the best I love them.BUY THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good reads,Our granddaughter was delighted with the books and the fact that it comes in a box keeps the books neat.
2,A decent read,"I thought I'd try this series out, since I've been reading Harry Potter (and can hardly put the books down). I've got Artemis Fowl, and several other modern tales on my ""to read"" list, but had heard a lot about Lemony Snicket's books.The first book was very clever, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the orphans and their adventures and unfortunate happenings with Count Olaf.Then I made it about half-way through book two, and just couldn't go any further. When I have children, they may enjoy this series, but to me it just got too monotonous - the word ""monotonous"" here means ""the series seemed to carry on and on with the same uniform dialogue and events, except for the environment which apparantly changes in each book"".Don't get me wrong, I found the author's use of unknown words and defining them a great way to help children with their vocabulary. This series just wasn't for me.A different opinion,pairofdivers"
2,I really wanted to like these books...,"I saw the covers. I read the backs of the books. I was sold on them in a minute. I instantly thought of Edward Gorey and Charles Addams and I become excited at the prospect of being swept away into a morbid childhood fantasy.And, quite honestly, the books deliver exactly that, but nothing more. I enjoyed the first book but became increasingly frustrated with the second and third.The children in these books are powerless. They recognize the bad guy but they can't DO anything. Snicket tells us that the children are smart, brave, and resourceful, but they seem to spend most of their time waiting in helpless terror. Not a very brave, smart, or resourceful thing to do. This really bothered me.Also, the books follow a strict formula - which I know is popular in books for younger readers. But he clings to the formula with a despairing lack of imagination.I'm probably being too hard on the books, but that's just because the premise and the style have so much potential."
5,A VERY IMPORTANT BOOK FOR TELEMARKETERS,This is a great and interesting book. The first book actually dealing and deals well with the voice in a very full way on the phone. It uses metaphors that fit this important subject making it easier to understand what you are doing as a salesperson on the phone. I have highly recommended it to others in sales as one of the must reads. It should be a must read for all who conduct business over the phone. Thank you Renee and Sandra. VERY WELL DONE
4,Covered in Yellow Hightlighter,"Packed with quality information. I bought 3 books, read them all. This was the best."
5,Excellent Reeds,"Bought these reeds for my son, it was perfect for him, and sounded great. The best part is that the reeds are individualy wraped in perfect humidity conditions. So when you need a new reed it is just right and only needs to be conditioned once for perfect performances."
4,Remember the Subject,"I have read dozens of books on political behavior, and have been disenchanted by most of them. This however was not the case with The Charismatic Bond. The story of Juan Peron itself is magnificent, but Madsen and Snow seem to help us understand the story of the people that made Peron legendary, as well as, circumstances that surrounded his rise and subsequent fall. Despite all of this you still must have a taste for politics to enjoy this book."
3,Hard to stay interested,This is an okay book. It's hard to stay interested for too long. I use it to help me fall asleep when I go on roadtrips with my husband.
2,What book?,I have yet to receive it. Can you help me out here? It has been about five weeks since my order.
3,bummer,"Have had the fountain for 2 months - by the time I got power to the site (I thought it was solar, which it isn't), it ran for a couple of weeks. I put water in it daily, but today the motor is no longer working. Not sure what the ""limited warranty"" covers but the sellers won't do anything after 5 days. Great fountain, perfect for the garden space I put it in, nice sounds, but very disappointed that the pump is out already. Hoping the manufacturer will come through... if I can track them down."
3,thineagle,"This my first Topol book, and I really liked it, except for two major flaws: 1) all of the women Ben encounters are drop-dead georgeous, and 2) in the end four people are wounded and we never find out what happened to them. We know Gwen got killed, but what about Art, Traynor, Jim and Theo? Please don't do that to a reader from now on."
1,AL1914 stands for Absolute Lemon,"The worst monitor I have ever purchased. Completely unreliable. Repeatedly quits working after 6 weeks of operation. It has been in the repair shop more often that it has been on my desk. Had to ship it back to Acer for repairs twice before they agreed to ship me a new monitor. Then Acer reneged and refused to direct ship a new monitor to me. Customer service at the Round Rock Texas repair facility is horrendous. Rude, short, impatient, inflexible. One agent hung up on me after refusing to assist and refusing to put his supervisor on the phone. Avoid this monitor at all costs."
3,much smaller than pictured,"This pup is smaller than it appears in pictures. Would have been nice to see a photograph of it in the context of a child holding it to give you an idea. The fur is not soft. It is kinda cute and my 3 1/2 year old enjoy it. It does bark when you tug on the rope as described. The arms and legs don't move. It fit the bill for Christmas because my son had asked for a puppy, but I wouldn't buy this product again."
3,Shipped with loose parts,A lens inside was rattling around loose inside....unable to focus upon arrival. I will not ever purchase NCStar products again.
3,if only it were Organic.,"Item was packed nicely. most of the leaves do not look healthy and are all cupped and yellowish, but with the proper care this lemon tree seems like it will pull through. There are lots of small buds on the tree, I really think this tree has a lot of potential now that it's getting organic fertilizer (the instructions suggested to use miracle grow.. ewww)."
1,Never Received,I can't rate my purchase because it hasn't arrived yet. I guess the system doesn't work for me. You had my money in an instant and I've been waiting over a month for my book. Does that work for you?
3,Not funny,"I think my husband would enjoy it, who has no idea what's going on inside a pregnant woman. For those who are already pregnant - waste of money and the book is not that funny."
1,Skip this one -- not for serious people,"I'm a mom of three and a child birth educator. I picked this book up thinking it would be funny and a great way to look at pregnancy. WRONG!This book does nothing to educate women about pregnancy. It is a list of complaints, and the author spends most of the time focusing on her own selfish needs with no regard to the life she is carrying. Pregnancy isn't about the women -- it's about the babies.I'd pick up Vickie Iovine's work any day before this drivel."
5,Wonderful read,"This book is a wonderful read for first time pregnancy, women thinking about getting pregnant- or any woman that has been pregnant- Really a pleasure to read"
5,You will laugh,"A very quick read that covers some delicate topics in some very funny ways. It is open and honest, and she's very clear to cover the fact that this is only her experience. I loved it!"
1,If this was what women actually experienced during pregnancy we'd be extinct.,"My wife wanted to get this book thinking it would be a realistic take on pregnancy and not a stiff medically based book. Turns out either Jenny McCarthy had the worst pregnancy in in the history of mankind, having the worst possible case symptoms, and every possible side effect, or she exaggerated the everything written in this book. And if the exaggeration was an atempt at humor? That was a major failure as well. The book has little usable information and is easly the worst $10 spent in my household in the last year. I don't write many reviews of anything, but if this prevents someone from wasting their time and money on this book, it's time well spent."
5,Must Have for Soon-to-be Moms!!!,"This book is excellent, and in my opinion, a must have for those who are currently pregnant, or attempting to become pregnant. This book gives you a not-so-sophisticated look at pregnancy and all it entails. Jenny McCarthy makes you laugh, cry, and reflect in this well-written book! If you are looking for something to get a mom-to-be, this is definitely it!!"
5,My Wife LOVES Jenny's book,"I bought this book for my wife and she really loved it. She thought is was so good and so truthful! She actually talked ME into reading it. My wife's right, it was hilarious and O so real life. I remember my wife going through a lot of what's in the book. Great job Jenny, you tell it like it is."
1,A Very Uneducated Approach,"This book is meant for a light read and not to be taken seriously. Jenny is very uneducated in her approach and what she considers facts in this book. If you are a first-time mother to be, don't expect to learn anything from this and take it w/ a grain of salt. Buy a book that is written by someone educated such as a doctor if you want to learn what's best for your baby. Jenny M. is trying to be funny throughout this whole book, but she just shows her ignorance in what is best for an unborn baby. she obviously did not do any research about how to care for her unborn baby; obviously her child's health was not a priority but how she looked her whole pregnancy was a priority. Skip this book...it's no good. I fear any mother-to-be who thinks that this book is a good source of information."
2,I just didn't find it funny - disappointing,"I bought the book because I had heard good things about it and wanted something funny, lighthearted to read during pregnancy but I just didn't find it funny.I had hoped to get more of a funny account of the author's pregnancy and did not expect advice on what to expect.It mostly boils down that the book and I did not connect. It wasn't what I had expected and not the humor I had hoped for.This is one of the very rare occasions that I am not able to finish the book and even consider to sell it.Very disappointing."
4,Gave me Belly Laughs,"This was an easy to read, humerous guide through pregnancy. I read it in my first trimester and the last chapter brought me to tear...or sobbing rather, on a plane as I finished it. The only ""bad"" thing about this book was that it was too short!!"
3,funny but not so useful,"This is a book describing the authors experience of pregnancy. So there isnt much info thats medically instructive. Although its a good book for sharing experience and thoughts, for those who do not suffer from any pregnancy symptoms like myself this book is merely something to kill time with."
5,Great read for every pregnant woman,The book is very honest and very funny. Jenny does a great job at sharing all her embarassing pregnancy stories and reasures us that what we are expieriencing is in fact normal!
5,Great laugh for those expecting,"I read this book during my 7 month of pregnancy and laughed so much. I almost wished I had read it earlier in my pregnancy, but it was nice to look back and compare her experience to what I had gone though at the time. It is so true and to the point. Jenny really tells the story of her pregnancy well and with lots of humor that many can relate to. It is a quick read too, I read it in about 3 days."
4,My husband loved it!,This book was really entertaining! An easy read (I think it took about 4 days to finish)! My husband loved it too! Caught him reading it when he thought I wasn't looking.
1,Not impressed,Did not find the book captavating at all. Was bored by it and didnt make it through 3 chapters I would not suggest this book.
5,A must read for anyone expecting,My brother and sister-n-law gave me this book to read while I was pregnant with my first child. I have since bought it for all of my friends who are expecting! Truly helps ease the worries of a first time pregnancy....very funny and good book!
4,Entertaining!,"Belly laughs mostly just entertained me. I read it in one sitting (took a little over an hour), and then threw it at my mother to read. She kept saying, ""Oh I didn't know that!"" Mind you she's been through two pregnancies, one with twins. This is definitely a good gift for someone who has just found out they're pregnant."
5,Could not stop laughing!,If you want a good laugh during or after pregnancy then you need to read this book! If you can relate to some of the stuff she talks about then it just makes it that much funnier! I highly recommend this book if you need a good laugh!
1,Idiotic,This book was horrible. Aside from glorifying her own incompetence the book's only purpose seems to be to tell women about the perks she is afforded as a celebrity.
1,Wish I had listened to the other 1 star reviews!,"Someone recommended just reading this while you are at the bookstore with a cup of coffee, because itis honestly not even close to worth the 10 bucks I paid to read on my kindle. I really didn't evenchuckle reading this book, it wasn't witty and it was very poorly written. Basically a grade schoollevel read, which I would have been fine with if it was at least FUNNY. Trust me, I'm not uptightand I probably have a worse potty mouth than Ms. McCarthy, it was just... yawn.Like other reviewers mentioned, all the little stories about her then husband were really sort of disturbingto me too - he seemed so unsupportive, even making fun of her and mimicking her when she was having a bad day.Didn't seem to bother her, but maybe after reading her own book back she might have realized thather collection of stories about her husband were kind of sad.It would be nice to have other reading options besides the uptight pregnancy books, but this just wasn'tthe one."
3,"Funny, but not much in the way of advice or substance...","I am a first-time pregnant mother and I was looking for an alternative to the stale textbook-like books I had been reading. Jenny McCarthy is truly a funny girl, at times shocking with her descriptive humor. However, the book really lacks substance and is all too short. It was a very quick read, good for a couple laughs. I'm not sure what I took from it besides sympathy for Jenny based on how difficult her pregnancy and delivery seemed to have been."
4,"I laughed, I cried, I mostly laughed.","Overall, would probably recommend it to an expecting friend. The book has a lot of memorable moments that make it worth the read. I must say I was surprised at how fast I read threw it. The only thing that I really didn't care for was the fact that I felt like I was trying to endure a conversation with a very loud, obnoxious person for a better part of the book."
3,2nd time mom didn't find it funny.,May be funny to first time mothers. I didn't think it was very good at all.
1,Not recommended,"I am so glad I checked this out from the library and didn't buy it. Even for free, it felt like a waste of time. Looking at all of the positive reviews on here, I'm honestly shocked. I wasn't expecting amazing literature, but it was very poorly written and honestly way too crude and negative to be funny. I felt like it was really exaggerated at made pregnancy seem like torture...it's really not like that in the vast majority of cases!! I felt like she was trying so hard to be funny that she just took everything to the extreme and it just didn't work for me. If you're looking for something that finds the humor in pregnancy but is still worth reading, try the Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy."
5,I loved this book,"First of all, this book is not meant to be educational, it is exactly as the title says ""The naked truth about pregnancy and childbirth"" from Jenny McCarthy's experience of course.If you have a sense of humor than I defiantly recommend getting this book. McCarthy talks about the experiences and feelings of pregnancy that is not often talked about. It's good to know that not every woman had a hassle free and wonderful pregnancy!"
2,A Waste of Money and Time,"I bought this book to have a fun empathetic pregnancy read; however, I did not find it to be so. Also, not that I expected the book to be very informative (if you want informative, buy a medical guide), but it was really not helpful at all. As for the humor, there were occasional funny moments, but I found most of the book to be crude. With all the pregnancy books out there, I would pass on this one and head for The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy instead. Now that book is hilarious, empathetic, AND helpful! This book was super short and had just a couple of longer funny stories, some of which were crude. I found that it didn't have enough material to really be very empathetic and fun towards pregnancy, and I found that the crudeness and perspective toward her husband while she was pregnant to be unrelatable. In summary: This book is a waste of money and time."
3,Just Okay...to me it wasn't funny but an easy read,"The only part I thought was funny was the last two pages written for the baby daddy (my husband). The rest is not typical of a baby book as far as the writing goes - written to be funnd. It wasn't funny to me. She is very straight forward, very honest and frank... I had no issues with it just thought it wasn't funny. I enjoyed reading it. Read it in less than a day. It is a very short book. Lots of blank pages throughout so there really isn't much content and no real medical facts rather pregnancy from a celebrity mom's perspective. Throughout I kept thinking she is just a dumb blonde that is all about image and looks - I know I am very cruel but that is what impression I got. I feel bad she had such a rough pregnacy and labor. My pregnancy so far has been fairly easy so could not relate to alot of her horror stories (knock on wood). It is worth the $10 and worth reading for entertainment."
1,"Not funny, not helpful","This book didn't make me laugh and it provided no helpful information. I thought I would appreciate Jenny's point of view and at least chuckle once or twice, but no. It wasn't funny, wasn't well written, and mostly I thought she made pregnancy and labor sound horrible. You can't say all those negative things and then wrap it all up simply by saying ""Despite all that, it is the most beautiful thing you'll ever do"". Don't waste your money. (At least I got mine from a free pile.)"
4,So Funny it Brought Me to Tears!!,"I absolutely loved this book. It was a light read. I wish it was a bit longer but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I related on so may levels with Jenny McCarthy. She stated some facts along with her opinions on certain subjects. She told the truth about pregnancy, the good, the bad and the ugly. I appreciated her honesty and thank her for making pregnancy such fun!"
2,I paid $11 for ....?,"I'm a Jenny McCarthy fan and appreciate her sense of humor but I don't think it come through in this book. Reading the Table of Contents will provide just about the same amount of information or ""insight"" you'll get from reading the whole book. Then again, its brevity didn't suck more than 1.5 hrs off of my life before I decided to stop reading. After about 100 pages I decided I didn't need to spend any more time on it. There were a few funny lines but the chapters are so short; I think she could have added a lot of value to the reader (and herself) by developing her thoughts and making them more substantive. If it's available at a library, save yourself the $11."
3,"Great laughs, but a bit too vague.",My husband and I loved the book and couldn't stop laughing. But if you're looking for a more detailed informative book on pregnancy this is not it. A great read for any expectant mom or even someone who's trying to get pregos like us.
5,very funny,"A great book about how pregnancy really is. Very humorous. Jenny covers everything. By the end, you will definitely not feel like the only one whose had a rough time during pregnancy. It's nice to hear that someone else has been through a similar experience."
3,"fast, okay read, number of pages are misleading","I like Jenny McCarthy, and being in my 2nd trimester of pregnancy, I was really looking forward to her book. The stories were cute and funny, but I agree with a lot of the average/negative reviews that the book is way too much of an ""easy read"". I finished it in about an hour. The entire book could have just been a really long magazine article! The number of pages in this book (192) is misleading because of the bold print and wide spacing. I liked her honesty and sense of humor, but wish the book had a lot more."
3,Good read but some faults!,I read this book in one day...it's very short. I liked the fact that she dared talk about things that no-one even mentions but I was disappointed that it is definitely not research based. It has no knowledgable facts and I would not use this as a reference. I have read several pregnancy books. Some good laughs but I really thought it was better based on the reviews.
1,Extremely Disappointed In This Book,"I expected to love this book, given all of the great reviews. Turns out I hated it. I originally planned to get this from the library, but based on the great reviews ended up deciding to just buy it -big mistake. The book wasn't very entertaining or funny at ALL! I am pregnant now, and have an 11 year old son. Maybe if I'd never had a baby before I would have found it more interesting, but really all this book turned out to be is one exaggeration or one cliche comment after another. Not to mention it's skinny with big print which means it took me all of maybe 2 hours to read. I'd give anything to get those two hours (and my money) back, what a waste! Usually if I take the time to write a review it's because I LOVE a given product, but this time I figured I'd better warn other pregnant women who are reading all of the glowing reviews, maybe I can save someone else a few bucks and wasted time. Sorry, but can't recommend this one."
5,Hilarious,"Never stopped laughing as I read Jenny's book. My husband, who never reads, even read the book cover to cover with numerous chuckles. This book is a must read for any pregnent woman."
5,What can I say...,"If you haven't seen this move just turn to the person next to you and they can tell you about it.. It is the move that opened up motorcycles to Everyone, in a day when they had a bad rap.."
5,Great gift!,I bought this DVD for my fiance who was a professional flat tracker. He had this in VHS now he can watch it anytime.
3,just ok,This one left a lot of blank spaces in the story sort of a letdown.I was expecting more from willem defoe
2,"Interesting premise, anticlimactic everything else","Normally I don't write movie reviews, but this movie was so horrible that I had to say it. The movie starts with an interesting premise. Then all of the sudden the rest of the movie makes no sense, and it ends in the worst possible way imaginable. Apparently there must be alot of deep story line and metaphors but none of it made any sense to me. If you don't want to waste part of your life that you will never get back don't watch this movie."
5,"Excellent, though tragic, film that deserves stronger reviews","This is a thoroughly engaging film that certainly deserves stronger reviews. While the premise may be a bit questionable, the story develops so well that it's easy to forgive. Definitely worth one's time to watch."
1,SLEEPER,"willem Defoe is a great actor but the story is soooo slow i fell asleep.I got what the story was about half way thru and i wish the movie had more action,something to make the movie more fun to watch.....boring........yawn........."
1,This is not a good drama.,"This is not a good drama.This film is one of the most terrible I've seen in recent memory. Dafoe as the hunter was brilliant, but the film is a waste of money and time.The beggining to this movie is boring! Once they go onto the jungle , it gets a little bit more interesting. However, it's still pretty boring,i've been waiting for something exciting in this film unsuccessfully. I wouldn't reccomend buying this movie,but its up to you."
5,Finally at a reasonable price!,"I had originally taped this album off WROQ-FM's ""Album Hour"" sometime in 1977 or 1978. (Go ahead, get out the calculator, I know I just gave my age away. Big deal.) That cassette was one of the prizes of my collection until I lost it during a move. What a treat to find it as a download at a reasonable price!The album itself definitely deserves 5 stars (and I don't hand those ratings out to just any album). Through all ten songs, nine originals and one cover of an old Bobby Vee hit from the early 60s, the performances are outstanding. Sound quality is where it should be for a digitized version of a 35-year-old LP. Get this album; you will definitely not be disappointed. The only reason I had not purchased this music before now was that I was unwilling to pay $30 for a Japanese import. That excuse is gone, and I have one of my prize albums again."
3,Kenneth Jay Lane: Faking It,More of a biography of the hows and the whens of Kenneth Jay Lane and his jewelry empire. Was hoping for more of a Jewelry Reference book which this is definitely not. Feel I wasted the money I could have used for a more in depth book about KJL designs and time periods.
2,Intuitive Old School,"I did find the book informative, or maybe I should say confirming, to one of the basic concepts of running a lean small business Job Shop, short lead times. This book like most, did not acknowledge contemporary business tools like ERP software and related smart business process nor did it address overhead and cost control. Ultimately quick turn around times, the focus of the book, are only at best 1/3rd of the pie. Low overhead, rock solid process and information flow, along with streamlined manufacturing make a recipe for success in today's cut throat job shop environment. The book was just a glancing blow, not nearly broad or detailed enough to give someone a real shot at running with the information and competing."
5,My Gardening Bible,"I loved this book! I knew very little about growing vegetables and needed step by step instructions and confidence. I even ordered the lettuce from Territorial Seed Co. on the last page and they grew well! If you live in the Northwest and want to grow vegies organically and as a bonus, harvest year round, and don't want to spend alot of money on a book, buy this book!"
4,Drummer's delight,"These sides were originally recorded in 1953-54 for Norgran. Many of them, naturally, feature Bellson's drumming (""Percussionally speaking,"" ""A pearl for Louie,"" and the title track), which is just fine by me, since I rank Bellson among the best drummers around. Added highlights are ""For Europeans only,"" which is a great feature for tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray, and ""Phalanges,"" which features trumpeter Maynard Ferguson. A very appealing CD."
1,Beware!,Beware! This product has the potential for the scrubber to come off the wand while in use. The scrubber then sinks to the bottom of the toilet and disappears and can clog up the toilet and your plumbing. The directions state clearly state DO NOT FLUSH SCRUBBERS.
4,"Aliens, extended edition","Newt's Tale is a good, solid movie adaptation of Aliens, with a few additions. The first twenty or so pages tells the story of Newt's family, and how the alien plague beset the colonists. It's interesting to get the backdrop to the story that we weren't provided in the regular edition Aliens movie. However, once the story moves to the Marines coming, it becomes a movie adaptation, strait across the board. Nothing new or original is added until the last page of the book.It would have been strengthened if the adaptation were less literal, if it showed some of the more quiet moments the film missed.Still, Richardson's script is good, and Somerville is a good artist for the book. The aliens are dead on accurate in the way they look, although the people don't look exactly like the actors in the movie.If Rebecca Jorden, AKA Newt is one of your favorite characters, and you don't mind an adaptation graphic novel, this is a good addition to an Alien's collection."
3,I saw a parody,"The Movie Machete is a C+ movie and what i saw seem to be a parody of the Arizona Senator.Maybe it is just me, but since i do live in Arizona and notice the things in this enviroment, i picked up on the border wars and how our politicians are using it for leverage in vote getting, and what seem a little peculiar is that in Arizona the Senators name is John McCain. in the Movie the Senator name is John Mclaughlin. It did not bother me, it brought more humor to it for me and i found it made the movie more interesting. the excitement stayed noticeable although in some cases a little over done."
5,Peeple r dumb.,"Anyone who expected anything more out of this film than big dumb fun is taking this movie, and really, themselves, WAAAAY too seriously. This film, with tongue placed FIRMLY in cheek, is fantastic, fun, and insanely idiotic, much like the '70's grindhouse movies Tarantino and Rodriguez often pay homage to. The only people, in my opinion, who find this movie worth a one-star rating are the cynical, self-loathing film-dorks who sit through movies for the sole purpose of gathering excuses to complain about it. Shut up, sit down, and have a laugh for crap's sake.Also, I think it's hilarious that under the ""Tag Suggestions"" on this screen, there's an 'click to add' option for ""Steven Segal is fat."""
1,Awful,"A really horrible movie, worst I have ever seen. The only value in it is showing the typical hypocrisy of a right wing politician who campaigns against the ""illegals"" from Mexico while all the time profiting from them. Goes on every day, by the way."
4,A heartfelt and entertaining contribution to the immigration debate,A heartfelt and entertaining contribution to the immigration debate. Also a freakin' awesome modern Grindhouse-style movie with the budget to make it look good and a bunch of stars pretty obviously enjoying the liberation the material affords them to chew the scenery.
4,don't think too hard,"Definitely leave your brain at the door with this movie. I love this film !!!!!Sure, their is a plot but I really don't think you are meant to think too much about it. It is a just a good ol' splatter movie with over the top violence, blood, gore, the odd gratuitous nudity and overall doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you when viewing it.I think some people have over-analyzed this movie a little - just enjoy it for what it is."
1,Bloody bore.,"Predictable plot, outlandish violence with a vengeance theme. Seems I have seen this movie before....like a million times, just different titles."
1,waste of talent and the viewers time.,It really is a shame because I normally love to watch Danny Trejo and movies by Robert Roriguez. The movie was basically a ridiculous pro illegal alien propaganda piece. The American patriots and law worked for drug lords. Give me a break! The illegals fought our patriots ON AMERICAN SOIL for THEIR RIGHTS.....and won the battle. What rights? They are illegal. In other countries illegal Americans would be killed or imprisoned for doing what they do in this movie! This movie is really a big waste of talent and the viewers time.
2,First 10 minutes are good,That's it! The first 10 minutes are good and the rest of the movie not very. Felt like the movie budget ran out after 10 minutes.
2,Wanted to like it; couldn't handle the violence,"I loved the casting and the movie was beautiful for what it was; but just not my cup of tea.I couldn't stand the gore; which I find odd because the over-the-top killing in Kill Bill or Rambo was fine with me.So this film lacked something to keep me intrigued, but I still recommend trying it because I can see where some would love this film. If you liked Deathproof or any of the other two aforementioned movies, give it a whirl."
1,A Racist Anti-American Movie,"Yes, this movie is pandering to the Latinos in the audience. What do you call it when you have a 'hero' who enjoys chopping up Anglos, all of whom seem to be low-lifes and disgusting characters? There is no realism, and splattering blood and body parts all over is no real.The movie's director must be a mental head-case to want to glorify this sickening kind of krapola, while he pretends to want to create a Latin Schwarzenneger...frankly, you can have the original, just dub him in spanish and you've got your machisita on celluloid.Redeeming qualities of the movie? ............still thinking about that tough question............still thinking..........."
1,GARBAGEEE,"This is the worst movie ive seen this year, it tries to be like kill bill with the blood and twisted theme, but it just garbagee!!!, It doesnt make any sense. Simply Basura de peliculaa!! no la vean."
4,nice album,"if you're a fan of the Screaming Trees you're bound to love this.. Gary Lee's voice is an acquired taste to me.. especially in stuff like the chorus of ""white plastic""..songs like ""Illumination"" i could listen to forever though.. ""Silver Castle"" is good too.. very airy..id very much like a second album from Mr. Connor.. seeing as the Trees are no more of course.."
2,Buy another rug,"This interpretation of ""Coptic Light"" is horrible. The magnanimous coptic tapestry was abraded by corrosive chemicals, and thrown in a humid catacomb where there is no light. I wonder if the other reviewers were so positive to this recording simply because it is very unusual that American orchestras record Feldman's music. I recommend instead the beautiful reading by the Berlin Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Morgan (Cpo # 999189)."
2,How to be a Sycophant,"How do you kill the zeal that a young, aspiring, future business leader has with regard to arguably one of the strongest force in American commerce in the past 30 years? You give them Slater's biography on Jack Welch. Jack Welch's accomplishments are not to be diminished by the gosh, lavish, effusive ... style of Slater. Readers may be able to wade through the Jack-this, Jack-that approach that Slater employs to really find significant kernels of what Welch's contribution to corporate/business thought has been. It is for this reason alone that I do find some value in this book. Slater is an accomplished writer in his own right, but as a strong biographical depiction focused on delivering the mind of Welch--this books leaves you wanting."
4,A Good Book But I Prefer Jack's Own,"I bought this book before reading Jack's ""Straight from the Gut"". When I read this book I thought it was 5 stars and I re-read this book at least once looking for clues to help my own business. Then I read Jack's book and realized his was better. In any case this covers all the basic aspects of Jack's methods including the educational meetings at the GE ""university"", cleaning house, picking winning companies, eliminating small market share companies, and promoting top performers and eliminating underperformers. It shows how he is hands on.Good if you want to read two books on Jack Welch."
2,Made in china,First I guess my biggest dsappointment was that this item is made in China. I am trying to avoid items made in China. Fagor advertises theirproduct is European made in Spain. Secondly the instrucitons say to put olive oil on the seal. Well the day I put olive oil on the seal it burntso I need to replace it after only 5 uses. I am still debating whetherit is worth the extra money to constantly replace seals. Maybe I will just use it as a sauce pan for I do have a lid that fits. Haven't decided yet. Money is tight. Otherwise it did cook the items fastbut don't think it is worth the extra money to replace seals all the time.
2,The low point of the series,"Godzilla vs. Spacegodzilla is not the worst of the lot, but it sure comes close. Spacegodzilla, Little Godzilla and especially MOGEURA all look jaw-droppingly bad, and the special effects aren't Koichi Kawakita's best by any stretch of the imagination. The story and the plot are nonsensical, and while the original acting wasn't bad, the dubbing is horrific. The battle between Spacegodzilla and MOGEURA in the asteroid belt was the low point of the series with regards to special effects. The sole saving grace of the film is Godzilla himself. Kenpachiro Satsuma does a good job portraying the great creature, even under the less-than-stellar score composed by Takayuki Hattori. If you're looking for a worthy sequel to Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, skip this and get Godzilla vs. Destroyer."
5,Spacegodzilla is really awesome,Space Godzilla was really cool and at the end of the film Space should have transformed into the new and more powerful SUPER SPACE GODZILLA that would have been really awesome if that had happened it is my second favorite movie after GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAH. I would give this movie 10 stars
3,Destroy All Monsters,I like it because it look good and it iook like it is vrey flighting to me . THANK YOU....
3,Quite typical.,"The movie by itself is, sufficing to say, not bad and definitely worth the while to any avid Godzilla fan. However, compared to the more recent Godzilla films released more recently this one falls somewhat short of what one would ordinarily expect. Compared to the cinematography and special effects for instance, of the former Godzilla film - e.g. 'Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II', and 'Godzilla vs. Biolante', this one lacks the realism and overall film quality the former had."
3,A Study In Terror - Not For America,"A realy good Sherlock Holmes Flick, a must for your collection if you are truly a ""Holmsian"". Unfortunately this little gem was only released in The UK and Europe, and was produced in the parochial ""PAL"" format. Unlike every other Holmes Feature, it was never released in the US or Canada in NTSC. So good luck in trying to find a copy you can view. There are a few used VHS copies in circulation which will play in the US, they are diufficult to find. This is an unfortunate act of omission which probably will not be corrected due to copyright regulations. Judi Dench appears in her pre-James-Bond personna."
2,This book left me cold,"I bought this book after watching the History Channel special of the same title in the hope of learning more on the subject. Unfortunately, this book added little to my knowledge base. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. In his ""Acknowledgments"" section, the author admits that his treatment ""glosses over many passionate historical controversies."" Of course, I didn't read that little warning label until it was too late. Oh well. In any event, what the author failed to mention is that his book is more of a polemic on global warming than a treatise exploring a fascinating period of history. That's too bad. If you want to learn about this subject, I would strongly recommend the aforementioned History Channel show. Not only does the show more thoroughly examine how the Little Ice Age changed European history, it can be viewed in less than two hours. I spent more time than that reading this book, hoping to learn something that I didn't already know. I wish I hadn't."
2,Incoherent,"Yes, the author shows how climate was a ""subtle catalyst"" of history. It is an important message for those of us who are somewhat buffered from the impact of climate change.The problem with this book is not its facts or its message, but its organization. The author's apparent love of anecdote overwhelms the reader's need for a linear story."
3,Occasional Sunshine,"The pleasures of this book are anecdotal, not scientific. This is a stew of interesting geologic research and weather-related historical reveries without a convincing scientific framework. Although the book attempts to connect long range weather trends [in this instance, chill] with historical-political consequences, the author really succeeds in making the case that weather episodes are much more problematic than centuries-long trends. If anything, the reader is relieved of a fear of climactic Armageddon, as most of the weather catastrophes described by the author would be ameliorated today by better forecasting. And after several hundred pages of the evils of cold weather, the closing chapter on Global Warming appears as a welcomed friend."
2,"Nice cover, great stories, lousy science.","It is as always disappointing to read books cashing in on the public awareness of an issue when the author is blissfully unaware of what the issue actually is.A writer in the non-fiction field has an obligation to understand the issues; it is not good enough to weave together a home made opinion (or is it from a Sierra Club brochure?) on climate science with bits of history. It's been tried before - see Christenson. Sold well, misled many.The violent climate changes in a geological perspective and the pronounced ones during the past 10,000 years have impacted life on the planet in a myriad of ways. A fascinating topic. Carving out a 300 year long window of time is fine, but the fact that the author has not bothered to understand climate change on iota ruins the book for me."
2,Huh?,Yeah well sure... now I get it...maybe...sort of...OK now I'm just reeaally confused. I tried for three weeks to get into this book but it just wouldn't let me. There are tantalizing bits that seem really interesting but they just don't pan out. The tai chi connection is just silly.Look elsewhere for info on physics and learn about tai chi from a teacher not a book.
2,Rocky blu ray collection,Not quite blu ray quality. The transfers were not very good and at least I-IV were standard definition. Glad it was only $20.
1,From the So-bad-it's-good Dept.,"Not liking this movie in no way reflects critically on the skier's life and misfortune; understand that first. That having been said, I have to tell you that I hated this movie and the Hallmarkesque treatment it gave this skier's tragic story. The filmmakers didn't care about Kinmont; they had both eyes on the audience, with plenty of Kleenex at the ready. I used to discuss one part of this movie in my college English classes as an example of how not to tell a story:SPOILER ALERTFor those of you who saw it, remember when the phone call comes, informing the family of her lover's death? I swear, that call was followed by a slow pan across each family member's face as he or she cried, culminating in Marilyn Hassett bawling away for us. Am I right? How can a movie move anyone to tears when it's doing all the crying? This was the visual equivalent of purple prose, but, as you can see from the other posts here, purple prose sells, else it wouldn't exist."
3,Not Betula from Midwest Sports,"Midwest Sports are not shipping the item they are advertising. They do not carry ""Betula by Birkenstock"" instead it is a similar, but different item. They are shipping ""Birko Orthopadie"". Buyer be ware."
3,you get what you pay for,"I've worn Birkenstocks for years and have always loved the comfort and fit well in a size 37 (although the shoes I bought previously were open-toed). Bought a 37 in these shoes and the toe box was too small, so sent them back (had to pay significant postage) and got a 38. The toe ridge is too far forward so it's annoying in that regard and the foot bed is not as supportive in the arch. They're just not the same as real Birkies & overall I'm disappointed. I'll still wear them from time to time but they're definitely not my favorites by a long shot."
1,poor after 3 months college campus wear,"my daughter bought these herself, because she couldn't afford the real birky's. she bought them in august 2006, now november 18, 2006 the soles are worn out and the buckle just broke yeaterday. wasted pair of shoes. anyone have any ideas for good affordable shoes similar to birkys??pat- mother of msu college freshman"
2,Misleading image,"The image posted is misleading at best and fraudulent at worst - the actual poster includes a thick white border around all sides, with text (title and artist name)on top and bottom. The actual artwork itself is only in the center of this 13x15"" poster, measuring only 10""x10"". Would not have purchased this if true image has been shown."
4,This one was nice~but i loved the Europe tour DVD,"Not dissin the USA tour, but i loved the Europe Tour DVD better, after i saw this one. This DVD was a nice Eminem introduction to seeing his concert behind the scenes for me. I can relate to his music madness and Anger issues, it did give me fan comfort while i did homework lessons and Detroit love. I passed it along for other college woman to view~LMAOI hope i get it back~LMAOAmazon.com is so amazing, i can just order another one.Chinastar."
2,Not Even a B-movie,"I don't like to pan a movie, but there's very little positive I can say. Jun Ji-Hyun (Saya) was excellent. Everyone else was wooden. I got no emotions, no emoting, from any of them, it was like they were doing the first read-through of the script. And speaking of the script, it was as stilted and as wooden as the acting.The set design and background was equally poor. If the director wanted to capture the feel of a 60's era airbase, or just the 60's in general, he failed. If he wanted to capture the feel of a 60's era B movie, he did pretty well -- even the color values feel 60-ish. This would have been one of those films that got second billing as part of a double feature, back in the day, or were shown sometime after midnight, before the invention of the infomercial.I'm not going to compare it to the anime it's based on, because it fails on its own, without any need for comparison."
3,ugly colours,"i have bought this movie by amazone.de and the colours are sometimes incredibly ugly. everything looks yellow and no amount of tweaking of my tv or media player could help. a shame really, because the movie is certainly fun to watch. to be honest, i do not know if this disk will have the same issues. would be nice to know."
1,Doesn't meet advertised specs,"The package says it can provide up to 500 ma to each port. It has 7 ports so it ought to be able to provide a total of 3500 ma. The included AC power adapter is rated at 2amps (2000 ma) max. So it cannot meet its advertised specs. After two attempts to get satisfaction through their customer service, they didn't even understand my point. I didn't want to return it because I like the styling, but it goes back!"
3,Good match,"I had this pressure cooker over 10 years. I bought several Gasket, none match my pot. This one works great with my 10 years cooker. Highly recommend"
1,Do not buy this product,"I bought it as I needed a cassette format and the choices were limited. The recording is of poor quality, there is little information on how to structure the sentances. Basically, the instruction is just repeat the phrase. I do not recommend this product."
3,It was just ok..........,"Not my usual read. Don't know why I finished it other than its my Code of Practice to see it to the bitter end. Unless of course its dire, then I just don't finish a novel.Anyways, can't think of any reason to recommend this novel, won't be recommending it to my reading colleagues. Sorry, Author!"
5,For history lovers and architects alike.,I am so glad to find a reprint of this book! It has been impossible to return the one I have on loan. Some less known but notable architects like Pietro Belluschi are included along with the big names. Details such as floor plans and original cost per square foot are a bonus.
2,A Headache,This book was a headache!I have never struggled through a book like I did with this one.The author seemed to add what he thought Donald Goines would have thought or said.If you are a collector of Donald Goines books like myself only purchase this book for that purpose or leave it in the store.
4,Donald G.,"Donald was my favorite author. I have read every book he has published. So it seems only fit to read the biography. It was well written, and it kind of gave some insite to his writing style. I really enjoyed this book."
2,Upsetting,"This zen garden did not come with the two cranes, the rake was broken when I opened it, and the stones were as if you picked them up off the street. I would only enjoy this of I was sent what was suppose to be included and wasn't, the two cranes."
3,Not the Greatest,Kinda your average sports game...I'm not too into sports so maybe that's why I don't like this game much. I would reccommend this if your into football but otherwise stay away from it.
1,"Been there, Done that","How many times will people go through another Madden? The series is getting old and it never changes. This year is no exception. Just because it says ""2004"" means that everyone has to have it to stay updated. If you have ""2003"" or ""2002"" don't worry about buying '04. Just the same type of game with different years on it."
3,"yea, yea, yea, its the same every year","madden is very realistict but its no different from all the other versions, except 4 the owner mode. this is a complete waste of money if u buy it at regular price. i like the gameday series better and its always less money"
1,New Year New Game,"You must be a loser if you don't have it.It bothers me to see so many poor kids shelling out so much money for such a mundane product year after year. This game stinks, as does this moronic sport, and we should examine our lives if they've become so miserable that this is entertaining. No thankyou EA Sports, there's no substance in your game !"
4,why mike vick,"I think dan marino shouldve been on the cover not vick. He is the greatest ever, in fact I wouldve called this game Marino 2004, the game is fun also i like the bright colors and when i push the buttons the little color guy thingies move also"
2,EA Sports missed the mark (this time),"EA released Madden '04 too early this year. There was more beta testing needed to fine tune this years game. The defense in '03 was too easy to beat (unless the defender took advantage of the AI to trick the CPU) - the defense in '04 is too hard to overcome. Not globally; the CBs, FS & SS have far too many interceptions in terms of 'reality' or 'sim' football. And, there are too many fumbles and too many false starts (especially if you use the hurry-up offense). The fun factor is there on other aspects of '04, like Franchise mode, and mini camp. Even online play can be fun as long as you keep in mind the games limitations. Maybe next year EA Sports will get it right."
1,Madden 2004,"I recently bought the Madden 2004 because I liked the Madden 2003 so much. I couldn't wait to get it. After putting it in and playing it, it reminded me of NFL2K3 which I hated. The players looked so small and didn't like how the offense and defensive schemes reminded me of NFL2k3. The best thing I liked about Madden 2003 was the easy way to draft and trade people. Madden 2004 took all that away. Drafting and tradeing people in Madden 2003 a 1-2 hour process and now in Madden 2004 it took me over 6 hours to do what only took 2 at the most in Madden 2003. If you are a fan of NFL2K3 then you might like this game otherwise don't waste your time. Get NCAA 2004 which is much better. Disappointed buyer."
2,"Ok, but not great","I just spent a few hours with this game and I have to say I was a little disappointed. With all the hype around it was expecting more, but it was more or less the same thing with a few small extras. The game play is stiff and was lacking, I say they rushed this out too fast. If you like the same old thing then Madden 2004 is for you, but if you want a better football game NCAA 2004 is much better and will give you a lot more then Madden can."
5,Madden NFL 2004 - Michael Vick,"I've been a huge fan of madden games for the past 3 years...to me, i thought Madden 2002 was better then 2003, however, with what im hearing about 2004...this game will far surpass any other madden game...the fact that you can hire ure own staff and give signing bonuses is amazing...and im really excited for the new player ratings...i havnt even played the game yet and i already know who it will get a perfect rating..."
2,To arcady,"You want a real good football game, NCAA Football 2004. Madden has great graphics and extras but the game feels to arcady to me. Obviously my opinion differs from the rest of you."
2,Bug in Game allows you to always Win,This game is a waste of money. On the snap there is a bug or a cheat-like motion that freezes up the front line making it a waltz in the park to rush right past the line of scrimmage while the defensive line is frozen. Takes the fun out of the game.
3,Collector,Just needed to have it for my collection don't really play it. But it is a good game & it's a Madden Trendsetter.
5,The best football game ever!!!!,This was the best football game ever. It is so much fun. Compared to the other ones its the best. If you liked the fotball games you will love Madden NFL 2004. It is so cool. You have all lot options to chose from in the game. Buy this game.
3,Not what I hoped for,"I was hoping for an equivalent refill to my Paper Mate Designs pen. This ballpoint refill is scratchier to write with and harder to click my pen. I'm bummed, but it writes and I'm using it, and truthfully, if I don't go back to my other Design pen, I eventually don't notice there's a difference. Next time I will just be wasteful and buy another Design pen rather than refilling them."
4,Billy Durant and General Motors.,"This is a pretty good book, and gives basic knowledge about how GM was formed. This is one of the few books on the market that you can talk about when someone is purchasing a car, and the history of the company is different than I had expected. The book focused most of the attention on Billy Durant, instead of Alfred Sloan, which in turn made the title more interesting. It is a good story about how one mans drive can change the world as we know it, and it can also ruin him. I would recommend this book to a friend or relitive. But it gets a bit hard to hang in there for the last chapter or so (at least I thought so)."
4,"This is a practical book, not for beginers","This is a very good book to get practical skills in PHP development with MySQL appliances.But before buying it, it is important to understand that this book is not for beginers, this book assumes that the reader have a least basic knowledge of both tools."
2,mySQL for Dummies,Since the book was for dummies I assumed I would be able to understand it. Probably my mistake I should have researched it further before buying.
1,Still have not received book!,"I have yet to receive this book. Ordered in February, card has already been charged. Please send book..."
5,With Big Ideas is the best of Mumy Music!,"Bill Mumy has done a first-class, first-rate and exceptional job with this album! It is loaded with fourteen powerful songs and it's very easy to become addicted to any of them or all of them! I honestly can say that I do not ever want to stop listening to these tunes. Each song has incredible lyrics, blended with perfect music and polished with outstanding vocals! It's hard to pick any one favorite, because I love them all. I will say Mystery Road is quite a rocker that could easily become a hit. I think Rising Falls is a very impressive song and it really demonstrates that this is perfect music. From rockin' songs like Mystery Road, Overdue, and A Little Goes A Long Way to mellow songs like The Fire, A Man Of His Word and Missing The Missing. I feel this album has a little something for all musical appetites!"
3,The Balanced Body text,The book did not meet the description of being new. It has ratty corners and a worn cover. I suspect the CD has been used and resealed.
1,Dont Buy -NO Solution Available for Practice Problems,"I bought This Book from Amazon for extra Pharmacy technician Math Practice, When i done Practice question there is no answer sheet there so you can verify your solutions whether they are correct or not.i contacted IRC of the Paradigm set up account ,they replied answers are only for teachers not for student,If your teacher is not using this book you cant get answers, here this book becomes useless for those who want to do extra practice,Dont Buy This BOOK."
1,"Old, clunky, incomplete","I wish I'd read these reviews instead of the ones in the computer mags. I manage software development for a living. This program shows many signs of having never been redone since the early 80s. The graphics are crude, the method of specifying dimensions for cabinets utterly fails to use the Windows interface effectively. Most weirdly the `walk through' capability was hair trigger even on the slowest speed setting - tiny movements of the mouse sent the image spinning. Could this be due to my fast CPU - in other words, the program's interface rates aren't calibrated against real clock time, but simply CPU time? Something left over from the 286 days, if true.And it isn't useful. No sliding window types, for one example. Hard to snap walls to corners. Odd ways of moving components around that - again - don't use modern Windows conventions. My wife wanted to select kitchen cabinet types and was totally unimpressed by the types available. Textures are cartoonish."
3,"Good idea and thrilling, but the killer was too predictable!","This book started out really interesting and thrilling but really faded out in the end. It started out being a thriller and ended up being sci-fi. The killer is too predictable and is really unlikely.The main character, Abby, is a senior in high school and the captain of the cheerleading squad. Everything seems to be going great for her, until she's brutally attacked and left for dead on the football field at the school. As she recovers from a coma, she realizes that someone attacked her and might strike again. She starts to get visions that her friends are in danger. She warns them and one by one they turn up dead. Abby knows she must stop this killer who will do anything to hurt Abby and the ones she loves."
4,what I think,"I think that this has great gameplay, and graphics but I would suggest to EA sports that they need make each maddden year totally different. an example would be when you go to play a game and it shows all the players stretching and getting ready, first it shows the offense and then the defense huddled up jumping up and down together and I think that they did that in the previous madden and also some of the lines that madden or al micheals say are the same as last year. I think this game is great but they when it comes to lines and those warm up scenes that they need to start over and make that totally new every year and not bring the old same stuff back with the new version of madden that comes out"
1,not made for X-Box,"This game is just a port of the PS2. It does not take advantage of the X-Box's superior processing abilities. It may be fine for PS2 or Gamecube. Plus, Electronic Arts made it incompatible with X-Box Live. Heck, even Sega's ESPN 2K4 and NFL Blitz '04 are X-Box Live compatible.I recommend NFL Fever '04, which was made to take advantage of the X-Box's power...and it uses X-Box Live.Stop submitting to EA Sports' machine! All of the titles I just mentioned are of equal worth, or better."
3,Madden vs. ESPN Football,"I've played both Madden 2004 and Espn Football, and I have to say ESPN wins hands down, no contest, ESPN has great presentation, great graphics, great replays! Madden has terrible replays, most of them are not even full screen replays,ESPN is much more fun, rent both first if you want to see for yourself, I made the mistake of purchasing Madden before getting my hands on ESPN."
3,on line for x-box,"madden has been the best for years. That goes without saying. the only problem, if you own an x-box, is that there is no on line play for x-box. if you combine that with the fact that it comes out before all final cut/trades are made. This causes problems b/c you spend more time creating and trading than playing the game b/c you cannot go online to download updated rosters. Now I understand this is P/S 's way of getting you to buy a playstaion. what is crazy is that Madden works for MNF and ABC owns ESPN so ?????.If I could download rosters ect on x-box I would buy madden also. But for X-box owners the NFL 2K (ESPN) series will rule because no one wants to be playing madden ""2004"" with outdated rosters b/c of its early release."
1,HORRIBLE,"If I had known how dreadfully HORRIBLE this movie is (It's full of slanted off jokes that are just WRONG) I would never of purchased it as a Christmas present. Figured ""It's Dreamworks. It's got to be ok."" TOTALLY WRONG! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,Miss the 3-D - Otherwise a Good Movie,"Very enjoyable movie, especially for older kids and adults. I expected to see the movie in 3D and was greatly disappointed to find that only to B.O.B. Extras in 3D. Particularly since all of the other Extras materials couldn't stop gushing about HP & Intel. I have Spy Kids 3D on DVD and it was a very successful home view presentation.I actually bought the Blu-ray version on the single disc, and in my opinion the packaging puts lots of emphasis on 3D glasses and no indication that they're useless for the Feature Film, or that the Feature is in 2D only. I could not find it addressed anywhere on the packaging, at least in a font size I can read.If you're a techie like most of my family, wait for someone at Disney or Dreamworks to wise up and offer the 3D version. AND they better offer a decent discount for those of us that already bought the ho-hum version!"
3,Cool and not cool part II,"After posting a fairly favorable review yesterday, I must agree with Robert's point that the unit does not cool to as low of a termperature as advertised (35 to 40 deg). After 48 hours I have only gotten the temp down to 42 deg. which is not acceptable to me. I will call Maytag tomorrow and if they do not have a solution, this thing may be going back!"
1,Major dissapointment,"I have read all the bad reviews AFTER purchasing this monstrosity. DON'T BUY IT I have suffered through the delays from Maytag and the ""no customer support"" from those cavalier folks. The box itself looks nice & impressive, but is a step backwards in refrigeration technology, not to mention the mechanics of dispensing the cans (average 5 jams per day). You can be careful in the loading process, but the mechanics of the machine eventually misalign the cans. If you want an occasional nice surprise and get a beverage hassle free, this machine is for you, otherwise kick your dog and feel better. As a sidenote, I did not even attempt to attach the skybox to the hellacious base as the holes were nowhere close to lining up. I dare any executive from Maytag to contact me about my claims spoken here, but I know it will never happen because you can't even get customer service to respond."
2,Skybox problems,"I bought two of these units several years ago. One stopped cooling in late 2010. I looked all over for replacement parts as Maytag was absolutely NO HELP!!!I found a place online called ""Discount Appliance"" that sells several replacement parts for the machines. My problem was with the compressor starting components and once I replaced that part it works fine. The other unit went out with the same issue just last week. For once, I did the smart thing and bought 2 of the parts a year ago in anticipation of the failure in the future of the 2nd machine. Glad I did!"
3,a fix for dispensing,"I bought my Skybox about 2 - 3 years ago. No major problems with the exception of it not dispensing bottles. They seemed to stop sliding right before coming out the door. Well tonight I ""unleveled"" the skybox. I raised the back up as high as it would go. With the back high & the front low, the bottles now dispense as they should. Hope this helps."
4,AVAILABILITY,I AM NOW ADVISED BY MR. JACKSON'S ASSISTANT THAT THIS VOLUME IS STILL IN PRINT AND AVAILABLE. (6/10/00)
3,Trimmer is weak and inefficient,"To be honest, I only bought this shaver for the pop-up trimmer. I dont like a close shave, and I've been shaving my face and neck with trimmers for years. This trimmer is pretty weak and inefficient compared to other shavers I've used. It's just not powerful and doesnt cut the hairs well. Eventually I get a good shave, but it takes a long time of going over my face over and over. I think I'm going to buy a different shaver and just keep this as a backup. The previous Remington model that I had, Remington F4790, is cheaper than this one and does a better job (at least as far as the trimmer goes). I might order that same one again or maybe go for Braun. Braun is the only brand I havent tried yet so I'm interested to see how it compares."
2,Not so close shave,"About the only thing I like about this razor is the battery charge seems to hold up quite well. I don't have a heavy beard, and would expect a fairly close shave, but I am left with what feels like a five o'clock shadow. Probably sould have spent the extra bucks and bought a Braun."
3,Remington shaver,"I had excellent service and the seller did a fantastic job.The shaver is rated as #1 on Consumers Report so I tried it, even though I've always used Norelco.Did a fair job but left many visual uncut beard hairs.I could not get a real close shave.Returned it with no problems!Thanks!"
4,Cheap Remington electric razor,"Inexpensive Remington electric razor, functions well. High rated by ""Consumers Reports"". Good charging system. Only downside is the ""dead man"" switch. You must continue to hold/press ""run"" button down to use. I would prefer a continious-run off/on switch."
1,Don't Waste Your Time - it Doesn't Work,I did a lot of research to find the best shaver for my husband's step-father as a Christmas present. The Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver looked like it would be great. By New Year's Day he was asking us to return it and get our money back. We were mortified!
4,Warren's Shaving Experience,"The MS2 390 Remington electric shaver is efficient, quick, and leaves no face shine. It's cordless, meaning I can shave and do other things at the same time."
2,Remington Shaver,"Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's ShaverI purchased the Remington MS2-390 Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver on Jan 19th 2009, and I am not completely satisfied with it. I know they will not give you as close a shave as the standard bladed razor, but I find myself going over, and over my face in order to get a half way decent shave. I was advised by my Pharmacist to use and electric razor, as I am on Coumadin, and cut myself frequently with a saftey razor. I still use the safety razor ocassionaly when I need a closer shave.Sincerely,John Joyce"
4,Almost as close as a blade,"I purchase this item base on Consumer Reports recommendation and price. As stated in the report, the shaver is a little noisy but it does give a very nice close shave. I used it a few times going to work because I was running late in the morning, very convenient. I would recommend this product."
4,MS2-390 REMINGTON SHAVER,"SHAVER IS EXCELLENT, THE ONLY THING MISSING IS A HOLDER TO USE WITH THE SHAVER ON YOUR BATHROOM SINK."
1,Poor performance,"I found that this shaver gave a very poor shave, particularly on the neck where the cutting heads cou;ldn't cut the outstandind hairs"
4,Loud but great shave,"I bought this razor for my husband and he is quite picky about his razors. He says that it gives him the best shave he has gotten in awhile. Unfortunately, this is the first thing that wakes me up in the morning. This razor is unbelievably loud!"
4,Loud - but does a good job,"While I don't have anything to compare this to, I've decided to start using an electric razor to prevent all those cuts I seem to be getting with a regular razor. Since this model is highly related in a Consumer magazine, I thought I'd give it a try.The shave is relatively fast and easy to do and did give me a good shave.I was surprised however at how noisy it is. I almost feel like I need to wear ear plugs.The other thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a base to sit on. It has to either lie flat on your counter or you need to put it away in a drawer.All together though it does what I bought it for - give me a good shave without getting nicked."
1,"Horrible product, lasted only a few months","I bought this razor in June of 2008. It worked fine for about 3 months, but by October the blade was dull and actually popped off while I was shaving. The trimmer part still works fine, but I had to go back to using my old razor to do the majority of shaving. Keep in mind, I'm a guy who only has to shave twice a week. I certainly would not buy Remington again."
2,Dissappointed with shaver,"I looked the shaver up in Consumer Reports and noting that it was a best buy I ordered it. Delivery was prompt, however, I have a hard time getting a good shave with it. They say it takes three to four weeks for your beard to adjust to an electric shaver so I gave it more time with no improvement. Still missing whiskers and pulling on longer whiskers. Disappointed in its performance. I am going to send it back."
1,Disappointed,"Had a Remington shaver years back and was very satisfied. This newer one was abig disappointment. I would not bother. Other comments about being noisy are correct. HOWEVER, the big complaint was that it did not do a very good job at all especially as compared to my old Norelco."
2,Not Impressed...left long hairs on neck,"Like another reviewer noted in his review this electric shaver left long hairs on my neck also, even after numerous passes along my skin. In fact there was a point where I actually had to use my old disposable razor just to cut the hairs.This is my first electric shaver, and based upon customer reviews and a leading consumer products publication I was expecting better perfomance. I would not recommend this product."
4,Electric Shaver,"Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500 Rechargeable/Corded Men's ShaverI purchased this product for my husband, who has never used an electric shaver. He uses it for ""in-between-shaves"" and is more than satisfied with the function of this product."
2,Disappointed,"After 25 years of using Norelco Rotoray razors, I decided to try the Remington Microscreen razor based on the highly rated review by Consumer Reports. I was very disappointed. It is very noisy, awkward to hold and shave with the rotating motion as recommended by Remington. It does not give a close shave either. I have now gone back to my old Norelco Rotary and am happy."
3,"close shave, but,,,","Based on the Consumer Reports rating of this shaver I decided to buy one to replace my aging Norelco rotary. On the plus side, it give an incredibly close shave. On the negative side, it is quite noisy, and bulkier than my old rotary.My main complaint, however, is that the low battery indicator did not work. The light came on even after I had just recharged the shaver. After doing a web search I found that this is actually a common problem with this model. I decided to return mine and do a little better job researching before I choose my next one."
3,Remington MS2-390,It is a closer shave than I am accustomed to but does not catch whiskers that are grown out a bit and seems to struggle at catching the whiskers along the underside of my jaw bone. The top has a tendency to pop off by accident while shaving when I bump the buttons on the side. They simply release too easily dumping whiskers everywhere. I will likely go back to the Norelco if I cannot afford the Bausch when this is worn out.David
2,"Never gives a ""real"" shave.","Shaving with this so far, even with the ""shaver saver"" and other such things, has been tedious due to its simple lack of ability to give you a decent shave. No matter how hard I've tried with this thing, I always find myself reaching back for my good ol' three-blade & Barbasol."
1,A sad Disappointment,"I have used this razor for a month now, and finally went back to a rotary razor to get a good shave. I followed the directions on how to use the new razor, and all I got out of it was a nice facial massage. The razor seemed like it did not have any cutting blades in it. I pulled my skin tight and the razor just rode over facial hair like it was not there. To put it simply, the razor does not cut my beard. The razor is a sad disappointment. It looks good, fits my hand well, it just wont cut my beard."
2,Disappointed,I am very disappointed in this product. Battery does not last at all. The shave is not close and takes forever.
4,Rem390 razor,"Razor works fine. Clean,close shave,but relatively loud. Would recommend the product. Gives closer shave than Norelco I owned previously."
2,Really can't Recommend,"I read all the reviews and Consumer Reports dosen't usually lead you wrong but I really can't recommend this product.The noise dosen't bother me as I don't wear my hearing aids when I shave.The shave is very good but you have to make several passes.....I've found this necessary with all elect. razors I've used.The trimmer position is horrible.....after gouging myself a few times I cut a strip of duct tape and covered the trimmer as I don't use it anyway.Now, when I remove the head protective cover sometimes the whole head comes off without pressing the two release buttons on each side.This is a poorly designed and constructed product. If its not a big hassle I may return it."
1,Not As Advertized,"Bought this because it was described as ""Rechargeable/Corded"".I wanted a shaver that would run off the cord. Upon deliveryI found that it stated right on the box that it was rechargeableonly, not corded. Returned it unopened."
2,Shaver review,"This shaver shaves much closer than my old Norelco rotary; but it is way more noisy and takes much longer to do the job.Also, the charge doesn't hold any where near what my Norelco did."
4,Remington Shaver,"I love this razor..good deal for the money. My hubbie hates to shave, so the popup trimmer is perfect for removing those long whiskers. I then use the razor as intended for a final touch up. Much better than the old rotary shaver."
4,Good shaver,I've used different Norelcos since the 60's and finally tired of the progressively higher costs and consistantly slow shaves. This Remington MS2-390 provides a quick close shave with little irritation if used with a light touch. It is somewhat noisier than my old Norelco rotary but not enough to be a purchase consideration. I like the rechargable/corded feature at this price point especially if I have forgotten to charge it. The long run time is really great. The on-off switch DOES stay on if fully pushed. As others point out the trimmer is just for sideburns. There was no instruction sheet with mine so I printed it from their web site. Quick shipping by Amazon as usual.
4,remington shaver,"Works well, but not quite as well as I had hoped. However, it could be because I only use it to trim around my beard, not a full shave."
5,Remington MS2-390,"Product was received on time, effectively packaged at agreed upon price and operated outstandingly.Totally satisfied with purchase"
5,Remington MS2-390 Microscreen 500 Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver,"I have been using it for 6 months and haven't found anything I don't like. It does what I expected it to do. I like that the battery charges in 1 hour, and will not over charge if left plugged in."
3,not as good removing errant whiskers as my old rotary,"My 12 year old Norelco rotary was due for new heads (tho its still shaved pretty well). I decided to give the Remington MS 500 a try as it did well in Consumer Reports and I thought the trimmer might work better than the Norelco's. The Remington trimmer is better for sideburns, but I had to use the trimmer for areas with difficult hairs on my face too --which was too irritating. So now I shave with the Norelco and trim with the new Remington."
4,Nice close shaves,"Bought this last month after leaving my ten-year-old electric at a hotel.Pros: It really does deliver a nice close shave. It's not quite as close as a blade, but it's darn close, and it's *miles* better than my old electric. The battery lasts a while, it's easy to clean, and the trimmer does work.Cons: The trimmer is fairly weak and somewhat difficult to get to work on rogue neck whiskers.Overall, it's a great product except for the trimmer."
2,"Battery Kaput,almost.",Very disappointed in the life of the re-chargeable battery. Get 2 or 3 shaves(max.5 min. per shave) after being fully charged. Have used Remington rechargeable shaver's for many years and this is a first for me. Like the shave but getting annoying having to recharge it after 2 or 3 uses. Purchased in Feb. 2012. Shave 3 or 4 times a week.
3,battery life,"I've had this shaver for 2 years and the cutting power and effectiveness are great. It gives a really close shave. If you hold the cutting heads between your thumb and forefinger, it is easy to clean and should be cleaned every day. The only beef I have is the short battery life. Even after running the battery down and fully recharging it a couple of times a year, it now continues to die slowly. After 4-5 minutes of use, I have to plug it in and use it as a corded model. The shaver cannot be opened to insert a fresh battery. Instead, you have to toss out the whole shaver and buy a replacement shaver. The battery, which I charge daily, should last longer than 2 years. Probably an intentional design flaw on the part of Remington to get you to buy a new shaver.But I'll probably still buy another 390 because it works well and I figure I can buy 3 of them over the next 6 years for the cost of one newer model."
1,Hair Clippers ARE Better,I have a heavy beard especially in the neck area and dislike shaving so in my case - I am better served with the small black hair trimmers used by barbers. They are battery operated on 2 AAs and can be purchased for under 16 dollars with a nose trimmer
3,It will work...,"It will work for shaving... I don't like it as much as my old Remington. The indicator lights don't indicate when it is running low, so it just stops. I had the habit of holding my shaver close to the top of the device and on this model the screen release buttons are so big that I hit one and the screen came flying half-off with it on and close to my face and still going. So, I changed my habit on that, but the buttons are unnecessarily large to release the screen. The trimmer seems to be cheaper quality than the earlier model Remington that I had. This one of those fancy looking ""they-don't-make-them-quite-like-they-used-to"" products. BUT, YOU KNOW... it shaves the face. I have gotten used to it and it works in the morning when I need it and it charges fast and well, its a pretty inexpensive electric razor and I needed a new one. So, it works."
4,Good value,I bought this razor for my husband and it may not be top of the line but it does exactly what he wanted in an electric razor. He's happy with it and would recommend it to anyone and the price was right!
3,Great shave but... a throwaway razor?,"I've been shaving with this razor now for four months. It produces a smooth, close shave, lots of shaves per charge, no complaints there EXCEPT... It sure would have been nice to know before I bought this that when the rechargeable battery wears down and won't take a charge (they all do, after all), you just throw away the entire razor! Yup, instead of slipping in a new battery, Remington figured out that they could sell a lot more razors if they made it impossible to just replace the battery. Would you do this with your car? Hello, folks! It's the 21st Century, and we try to recycle and reuse these days."
2,Not as good as the reviews stated,"I got this shaver for my husband, he has been using for over the 30 days. ( can't return it now) It doesn't shave his face clean. He has spots under his chin and on his check that do not get shaved no matter what he does. This is his first foil shaver and he is not pleased with it. I would not recommend this to any one. Before buying I did a consumer report and it was rated high, and read most of the reviews which were positive. I took a chance and lost now looking for another shaver for him."
3,"Same sound, different album cover","Wanted to listen to a newer Michael Franks album to see if he has grown any as an artist. Alas, but...no.Unfortunately my same complaint applies...if you got one Michael Franks album, you got 'em all."
1,Its a sham,"This soundtrack cd only has 2 songs from the movie. The other songs on this cd are not even in the movie. Both versions of the song ""house of the dead"" from the movie itself sound nothing like the soundtrack cd version. I wish I had never bought it."
1,Easy read,"If you are expecting substantive theoretical sports psychological insights from this book, you will be thoroughly disappointed. While the anecdotes presented by the author are amusing, they provide little to no substance. Often, they are redundant to the point where it seems the author is beating the stain where the dead horse used to be. Each chapter ends with a short 1-sentence summary. In my opinion, the book could easily be condensed to only the chapter headings and the 1-sentence summaries, although it would be much less entertaining that way. The 1-liners do contain good information, but, unfortunately, much of it is what I would consider common sense.Unless you can relate to baseball and other American sports, don't bother picking up this book. Most of the anecdotes are from the world of baseball.That said, the book is a very easy read. I do not question the author's abilities as a sports psychologist. But I had expected a book with much more substance."
4,Great book,This book was very easy to read and comprehend the material. It provided basic sound advise in regards to mental athletic strategies. There was a wealth of references to very successfull athletes. I would recommend reading this book if you enjoy sports psyching techniques.
5,Its all in your mind,"Excellent selection of sayings and instruction from top athletes, sports psychologists, coaches and managers. Good instruction on the mental game. As Yogi Berra said, 70% of this game is mental, and the other half physical!!!!"
1,Get McReynolds,I have to agree with the other writer that you are better off with the McReynold's (ISBN 0842382909) Word Study New Testament. It uses a more correct Greek text with a translation (NRSV) that matches that text.
2,Disappointing and rambling.,"On his 1994 attempt to re-trace William Tecumseh Sherman's trek from Atlanta to Savannah, Jerry Ellis searches for vestiges of that traumatic time reflected in the people he meets along the way.This book is an unsuccessful hybrid of social history and an ""on-the-road"" travelogue. Ellis uncovers no previously undiscovered traces of the effect of Sherman's journey in the New South and after a while it appears he loses sight of his goal. This book has one saving grace: Ellis's natural story-telling ability which captures the spirits of the people he encounters. However, this bright spot isn't enough to compensate for Ellis's failure to achieve his original objective; it just turns this into a passable diary of someone's hike."
2,To The Point,"I know ""Bryce Yarborogh"" and I will be honest, I thought personaly that this book would be much better, even when he discribed it to me as he was writting it I thought it was going to be great.I was disapointed, this book seems to have a main theam Drugs, Drugs and more Drugs. Every chapter so far involves Pot, Hash or some other illegal drug. It is a commonality to every chapter he is high getting high or just got high and something happens.I was hoping for better. The good thing is i know atleast now ""bryce"" is no longer doing drugs."
2,Ambiguous Description,"The descriptive information I used to select this book was misleading. The book may be about ""configuration management,"" but it's not the configuration management I'm interested in as a manager of software development projects. (It appears to be for engineers who are building physical devices.)"
5,A classic.,"Long ago I've been looking for this book here in my country, where it was never released. Finally got it and it is better than I expected, concise, and yet profound, in a first reading he has clarified many of my questions. For those interested in old ships or building models of the same is required reading."
2,Warning: this changer may damage your game cartridges,"I inserted my ""Advance Wars"" game into this device and the game stopped working. In other words, my game cartridge is now defective and a useless piece of plastic. I had to buy another copy.I took a fool-hardy chance and tried another cartridge in the changer and it worked. But I'll be honest, I'm too nervous to use this thing anymore, because the changer is less-than $5 and video games are expensive, especially these Gameboy classics.Use this changer at your own risk, but I would give you my recommendation not to use it at all. Afterall, what's so hard about swapping cartridges? I was foolish in thinking this would make my gaming experience any better."
1,power swith don't work,"Opened the package. Slid the sp into place. Inserted 3 games. Flipped the power switch, and NOTHING. The little piece of rubber they use to SUPPOSEDLY let the power switch contact and move the original switch does not work. The rubber is too thin. can't turn on the game and then slide on the changer. [...]"
4,the ripoff game changer,"When I saw this game changer I thought it would be a save of time. When I got back home with it I opened it up and read the directions and tried it. It showed nothing!!! The next day I called the toll free number and they said that you need SP games to work this thing and I told them that any where I go to buy them games they didn't have any SP games. What a ripoff!!! I've spent 9 dollars on it off my Wal-Mart gift card. So, if you're thinking to buy one, don't. It's a ripoff and it does waste your time."
2,"Good on Paper, Not as good in actuality","I got this product thinking I could always have my 3 games on my easy-to-throw-in-my-pocket SP. Unfortunately with this product on the product, I thought the product became much to large and bulky to keep in my pocket.The product was thicker than I thought before I bought it (and once you get it it makes sense why). For the little time I used it the product did function well and did change the grip and feel. So if you are looking for a bigger grip this might be a good way to do it.I rated this product poorly because the idea really intrigued me, 3 games in one unit without the worry of carry/losing my games. In the end, the product was too bulky for my personal liking. The SP is supposed to be easy to carry around, this made it anything but that."
3,"Boring, and not really on the point","I have to agree with the previous review. Some of the discussion about the stock market is interesting, but not relevant to 401k plans."
3,Forceably Read on PC,I got this for class and had hoped to load it on my mobile reader which is NOT a kindle. i thought i could convert it. IT HAS DRM and is UNCONVERTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UNLESS YOU HAVE A KINDLE DO NOT BOTHER! a waste of money. now i have to drag my laptop to class to read my assignment.DO NOT BUY ANY DRMed BOOKS OR ALL EBOOKS WILL BECOME UNREADABLE.
5,Excellent product Reasonably priced.Highly Recommended.,"Splenda 400 pack is an excellent product at a very reasonable price.I just purchased 3 boxes of these last month.I find these much better than sweet n low.Please note each package is equel to one teaspoon of sugar,not two as listed.This is how they get their low calorie and fat counts.But still highly recommended 5 star rated.Thank you from Stewart L.02/17/07"
2,Avoid if you have low thyroid,"I can't recommend Splenda (sucralose) for people (like me) who have low thyroid problems. I loved Splenda for 10 yrs until I realized the connection - chlorine interferes with thyroid production, Splenda is made of chlorinated sugar, & over the years my thyroid was doing worse & worse. I now have to treat with medication & I still have low thyroid symptoms. I'm sick everyone telling me how hot it is when I'm always freezing. I wish I knew about Splenda & chlorine from the beginning...I wouldn't have 'poisoned' my thyroid for the past 10 yrs."
3,Acceptable!,You get what you pay for. The instructions sucked but I was able to figure it out. The materials are cheap plastic but I knew what I was getting. For the price and the free shipping it was okay. I think I paid a total of $43.00 dollars.
3,Missing the Christie Wit,"One of the things I enjoy about Agatha Christie is her unkind descriptions of people; she has a way of describing people in unflattering but amusing ways. The plot of the story is interesting, but not interesting enough to urge you to read it again and see what clues you missed the first time around. Still, it is an enjoyable book to read."
1,Do NOT buy on the Kindle,"I, too, bought it on the Kindle and agree with the other review - you cannont see the tables or training plans at all. It's definitely a waste. It should not be offered in Kindle format."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A story that makes extensive use of the bat as animal image and theme. Batman tries to track down a bad guy in Alaska, and comes off rather the worse for wear.While recovering, he undergoes one of those Shaman vision quest type things. Bad guys remain to be defeated before the end."
4,Perfect Fit.,"Received the product as advertised, the price and description were exactly what I wanted. It was a perfect fit."
5,A Touch From Heaven!,"I cannot say enough for the spiritual singing of ""The Greenes""! The last time that I heard the song ""Inside The Gate"" was when my cousins ""The Singing Sims"" recorded it! I LOVE THIS SONG and all of the other ones that I listened to! The Greenes are fantastic singers and I can't wait to rush out and buy their recordings! Thank God for such great talent!"
4,In Depth Study of a Classic Author,"This book provides a fascinating look into the life of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly. By reading actual letters written by Mary, to various important people in her life, you gain access to what her life outside the realm of literary circles was like. The author of this book adds interesting conjecture as to what the content of the letters means when clarity is needed or when certain facts aren't available. If you are interested in Mary's life & are looking for more than just a biography, ""Selected Letters of"" has much to offer. One star demerit for too little information from the time of her visit to Lord Byron at Lake Geneva in the Summer of 1816. Maybe there are fewer letters available from that time. But that's the time frame I am most interested in."
5,Eastwood is great.,"I purchase this DVD because my husband is a Clint Eastwood fan. He especially like the movie the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. He also enjoyed the other movies too.Great product, and great price too."
5,American cowboy west collection,"Clint Eastwood, the cigar-smoking fast gun-sling acted in the wild west following the saying - have gun, will travel. The Chinese bell boy in For a Few Dollars more, put the luggage out and in. He came for a few dollars more but was driven out. Nobody cared for the Chinese except the Free Masons.The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly was about civil war which divided this country. This is family feud over slavery. Civil laws to protect the minority finally came after a century of struggle.Hang them high is to revenge against the perpetrator.As American has the right to bear arm (means owning guns, assault weapons?), do we expect a whistling Eastwood, smoking cigar, carrying his revolver to patrol and protect?"
3,Purchased as a gift for a friend...,I really don't have a review of this product. It was a purchased as a gift for a friend and I keep getting requests to write a review so I'm doing it so my reminders will stop. There.
1,Very Slow Hard Drive,The setup was very simple. I set it up as a network drive. It took over 7 hours to transfer 3 Gig of data from the Buffalo drive to my local hard drive. Sometimes it says disk full when I try to save a file; even though I only have 40 gig on the drive.Do not expect tech support. I called numerous times and was on hold for over half an hour on each occassion and still didn't get to talk to any tech support. I am finally able to talk to a tech support as I am writing this review. I was told to update the firmware and check to see if the cause was a network problem or not. I just updated the firmware and the problem still exist.
1,Leaked!,"Looks like these worked out well for some folks, but when I tried installing them on my 2012 Prius, I couldn't screw them on all the way without slightly opening the underlying valve. Air hissed out immediately until I backed them off a ways."
5,Exactly what I wanted,I needed auto tire valve extensions and saw this item on Amazon so I bought it. High quality at a great price. Easy to install. Cap is a hexagon shape and easy to grip and screw on and off.
3,"Get More cuts For Less $s From Smithsonian Folkway ""Calypso in New York""","This is a nice collection of Lord Invader that is identical to the Smithsonian Folkways CD40454 Lord Invader ""Calypso in New York"" but does not include 9 bonus cuts. Wonder if the label Rev-Ola paid for the rights to reissue this material from SFW? Music is 5 stars release is lacking."
4,Learn about Korean society,"An at times funny read of the intersection of two cultures. One is the modern consumerist culture, that has taken firm hold in South Korea since the 1980s. The other is a traditional Confucian morality steeped in centuries of lore.Kendall studies this through the ingenious choice of marriages. Here, the Confucian traditions often appear in the form of arranged marriages. Yet she shows how young couples persistently try to sidestep this format.Along the way, a non-Korean reader is also rewarded by many insights into Korean society. Things that an outsider who does not speak the language would simply miss."
2,the most boring book i read in a really interesting class,"Getting Married in Korea was one of the 3 books my Cultural Antro professor mandated us to read. The book is excruciatingly boring. Unlike his other reading assignments, I couldnt see myself pass the first chapter (or even the first page!). Fortunately, I finished the book in a month. (woohooo). The content was in detail and the book with only few graphics. i thought it could have been better if the author stuck more pictures in their to at least entertain the reader while reading!"
1,West Point,"I bought the book because I found the subject matter provactive and read the wonderful reviews. However, I found it to be little more than stream of consciousness and in dire need of an editor. There is some good content but it takes a great deal of work to extract it."
4,A lot of dirty fun,"I watched Dr. Pol on television last season and will be purchasing this DVD for my daughter-in-law who is attending school to become a veteraniary assistant. I call it dirty fun because it is dirty like mud, poop, muddy straw, poopy straw etc. You get the picture. Dr. Pol is a vet who tends to large farm animals for the most of the day, then he goes into his office and administers to smaller animals like dogs, cats, bunnies, etc. If you are squeamish, a word of warning, this series shows it all...births, euthanasia, open wounds, prolapsed uteruses, and so much more. In fact, that is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. It shows animals in true distress which was hard for me to view. It also includes a little of Dr. Pol's home life and his relationship with the humans he's close to. And just a side note, he has a beautiful Newfoundland dog which I happen to think is the best breed of dog on earth. Gotta love a guy with a Newfie!"
1,Defective DVD,"Disappointed to find that after returning first DVD, the second one had exactly the same defect--missing last 2/3rds of third episode."
3,The man from snowy river/Return to snowy River,"I got these movies as a gift for another person, they where very happy to receive them. Thank you."
1,Excellent source material,"Mr. Bruce's contribution to self-aggrandizement turns out to be an excellent resource for both my Advanced Fiction Composition course and my Contemporary Editorial Practices course. In the AFC course, I have my students (when they can stop laughing) rewrite the story. Unlike Mr. Bruce's original, the rewrites must be either interesting or fluent. In my CEP course, I use chapters from the 'novel' as the course final examination. The text is a real curve-breaker though--it is not possible to find 100% of the errors. Truly a tour de force of grammatical incompetence. Encore! Encore!"
4,"i like it, but it wasnt all i thought it would be","i think this game is great. there is some little things that was on the previous game (2003) and now they have put it on 2004, like one thing they could've made differant was that they could've showed the coach throwin out the orange flag on challanges. The game is very good so if you want it i would suggest to go and pick it up."
4,Good book for those with twisted humours,"I enjoyed sitting down and reading this book, which read like an encyclopedia of all of Hells denizens. It is very well written and very funny, describing all who have wound up in Hell after their nefarious lives. A good fun read if you can find it."
1,"If zero star was possible, I'd use it for this worthless device","The extension on this thing is a joke - increases length by less than a foot. It is supposed to lock in place when twisted... well, it does not. it keeps snapping back to the short size. the head flops back and forth as you are trying to scrub. the rounded head does not get into the corners of a shower stall either. if you are sitting in a bath tub while cleaning it, this might work. buyer beware."
3,A tale of real life Hollywood,"This tale of life in Hollywood has a bit of dark humor mixed in with the tame tale of the making of the film 'Up Close and Personal'. The lives of the two writers become interwined with those of many Hollywood star directors and Corporations such as DISNEY (a real monster when it comes to movies) A real cautionary tale to try to help take away some of the happy mystique surrounding Hollywood writing, MONSTER is a good read for all those interested in writing for the greatest medium of all, movies"
2,Insufferable!,"No need to repeat what other negative reviewers have accurately stated. As my sainted Irish mother would have said: ""The man is too full of himself."""
4,"Easy speaker expansion, if you know what you're doing!","Make sure that you have the correct receiver output. If you have a receiver that outputs 8 OHMs or more, you can only attach one set of speakers to this expansion module, so it is probably not worth buying. If you have an amp or receiver that can drop down to 2 Ohms, you're good to go, you'll be able to add multiple pairs."
3,Very poor customer service by Amazon for this item,"I would give the watch itself a higher rating, but after four contacts with Amazon customer service, I still haven't received the instruction manual and my husband is not able to fully appreciate his gift since it's quite technical to learn without any instructions. We found some basic instructions on the Tissot website (no thanks to Amazon), and were sent a second copy of the Tissot catalog, but still no instruction manual. I would recommend that, although the price is great from Amazon, folks look elsewhere for this watch so that they can actually use it as more than just a time keeper."
1,I hate this watch,"I bought this watch 6 months ago, you can have it for free. No illumination at night and useless functions."
2,A nice watch for 2 years,"I've had my T-touch for 2.5 years and am now having problems with the touch functions. There are 7 touch zones on the crystal. Over a period of about 4 months, different zones have stopped working, one by one. Now, the touch functions are haywire, with no predictability. I had the battery replaced to see if it would fix it...it didn't. Since the watch lost about 2 minutes during the battery replacement, it is now 2 minutes slow, and I can't set it as the touch function is gone. So, its gone from a watch with many cool functions to a one trick (slow) pony. I don't think I'll spend the money for a repair...it looks to me like $250 minimum to do so.I really enjoyed the watch while it was fully functional. I still like the look of it and will wear it for its one remaining function (telling time) until it is no longer accurate. But the bottom line is that I am left feeling short-changed. I expected a longer life from a $500 watch, and a Tissot at that."
2,Don't bother - get a Casio instead,"The advantages of this watch: ""gee wow"" touch screen, heavy construction, sapphire, staus and prestige of the brand name.The disadvantages:* the digital display is often obscured by the analogue hands.* the digital display is rudimentary - poor format for date, digits only.* no countdown timer.The competition:If you really want a watch that does all the things routinely expected of a digital watch plus temperature, altitude and compass, look at Casio and Suunto. They have several models that do it all, with a clearer, more easily read display plus extra features like recording temperature and altitude. And they are cheaper.In summary, the Tissot is for status, but if you want a tool that will do the job, get a Casio or Suunto.I have had the Tissot for about 2 weeks. I will sell it and go back to my 15 year old Casio Alti-Thermo."
1,Buy the Cheap Version,"I purchased one of these in February 2007. It worked like a dream until it broke after three months of normal use. The gears on the inside stripped and it stopped blowing. I contacted the seller, who didn't reply. Save your money and go with the $10 model, or buy an old-fashioned bellows without as many moving parts. This one is prettier than the cheap model, but it seems to have disposable insides."
1,to weak and broke down after 2 days of use,"i bought it , cause it looks really good , but the mechanism is too weak , after useing it like 2 daysthe mechanism broke down , and the internal weels started to slip , so the power after that was useless.i am just telling what happend to me , maybe i am just to strong in turning that little wheel.things should be designed so an adult can't over crank an item, cause then its just to weak."
4,Good Game!,"I've never played this game myself, but my friend loves it. She enjoyed all the mini games and chatting with people. I think she would give it 4 stars, though, because it isn't really a game, and there are funner games for the nintendo ds."
2,well...,"This game is pretty much like Picto Chat,but it has color,music,you can customize your character and you can put a background.Dont use your money on this.Keep them until Dynasty Warriors comes out to sale or Need for Speed.The game are cool.Also Gundam is coming out."
2,This game is dissapointing,I do NOT like this game. Its was such a rip off. the only fun thing about it is trying to pick a number beetween 1-10 to get coins. and i even that gets anoyying!
1,Positive Reviews must be from developers,"I am amazed that there are a few positive reviews here. Please disregard these reviews as they must be from folks with a stake in this game. Basically, this ""game"" is making you pay for what you already get. It is a shame Nintendo deceived its fans by even allowing it to be released. So much for their past seal of quality."
4,"This was an enjoyable, entertaining & educational book!","Oh, it was a little redundant, but it had many amusing anecdotes and helpful hints that, so far, work with Chief B pretty well. But he is a fast learner, which I am sure is a big part of it. There wasn't much information on pits, or even a mention of Australian Cattle Dogs, so that was a bit of a disappointment. Still, it was a fast and fun read."
5,The Latchkey Dog,"This is an informative, easy to comprehend book on how our behavior affects our dog's behavior. I highly recommend this to both novice dog owner and experienced handler. I am a breeder with 7 dogs of my own and I found new insights as well as reminders of things I already knew but was forgetting to implement (like making my dogs ""work"" for love and food). Reimplementing these ideas has already created happier and better behaved dogs in my household. Another topic Anderson spotlights is selecting a dog. From a breeder's standpoint her suggestions on matching owner/lifestyle to breed characteristics are invaluable to guarenteeing a happy, premanent home for my pups. A must read!"
4,GREAT book,Very concise informative book. I wish I would have had it for my first year of PA school. It's very easy to read!
4,Good Book But Out of Date,"This book is a good start, but was written years ago and does not cover anything the band has done in the last 15 years or so. Someone really needs to write another book picking up where this one left off. There is so little out there on Grand Funk in book format. It would be great to see more of the members write their version of what happened over the years. Farner has written his side of things, so come on Don and Mel get your pencils out."
4,Pretty Good,Always been a fan of Grand Funk...Don Brewer is one of my favorite drummers. Gave some good insight info.....read it in one day.....
4,Vhs platoon leader.,Glad to get the video tape. The order was processed & delivered on time as promised. Amazon was great & I'll continue to shop here. The audio portion in some of the scenes on this new tape screeches. I'm guessing it might have gotten hot in storage. I'm going to see if another copy is available because I really like this movie.
4,"If you did not know Mr. Franklin, you do now.","In his own words, a history written by one of the greatest historical figures of his time. The narration is great as well."
3,"Nice piece, if you're just starting out","This product works well, but it is not easier either to use or clean than traditional measuring cups or spoons. I use it and have no problem. I guess it's just a habit to reach for what I've been using for years."
1,Very disappointing,"I've only used it twice now and the 2nd time I used it the top of the plunger separated completely since it was not glued in properly as I've seen people complain about in other reviews. Naturally this happened just 2 days after the 30 day return policy ended from Amazon. I could understand if I was rough with this or had soaked it for a long time etc. but for it to fall apart this quickly? Come on, I've been very gentle using it and carefully hand washed it. The plunger top just popped off when adjusting it as instructed.The rest of it seems to made of very sturdy plastic so I was very disappointed that it broke so quickly. I'd give it more stars since when it was working it did what I bought it for, measuring sticky dough and getting it all out of the measuring cup."
1,Pretty disappointed,"I just purchased this 2 cup Adjust-A-Cup as a Christmas present for myself this past Christmas (Christmas 2008), and would you believe that the black rubber that's supposed to form a seal as you slide the cup up and down has already broken? It has lasted me all of 8 months. I'm going to replace this with the less expensive yellow Wonder Cup which is what I should have bought in the first place. I already had the one cup Wonder Cup and was looking for a larger version. Like a fool, I was wooed by the good looks of the black and silver color combo. I'm pretty disappointed that this one fell apart so quickly."
3,Good Product with Careful Use,"This product is very handy in the kitchen. It really works wonders for combining several ingredients in one space while getting accurate measures. It is also fantastic for foods that are terribly hard to get out of a normal measuring cup, (peanut-butter, Crisco, etc.). While I don't personally like using it for liquids because of the lack of a spout it does get the job done.The one caution I would state is that I don't believe this product, (at least the plunger) is dishwasher safe. After about a year of use the black stopper at the bottom came loose and then fell off completely. It would probably be best to hand wash the plunger to avoid this problem although I don't know if it's a guaranteed solution.Personally I will plan on picking up a second one because of many of the positives I mentioned, but I cannot give a very positive review because of the issues I have had."
3,Stick with the 1-cup Measuring Cup,"The two cup option is not necessary and is very flimsy feeling. It leaks liquids b/c of the top heavy issue and the material the bottom made out of is just cheap. Great product. I would stick with the 1 CUP measuring cup b/c that felt much more comfortable handling liquids and it wasn't as top heavy and wouldn't spill so easily. I mean who needs a 2 cup option anyway? Save a few bucks, use the one cup (twice if you need 2 cups lol), and enjoy this great product."
3,"Great idea, cheap implementation","I like the cup, but there are much higher-quality versions out there. Plastic feels cheap, and the seal is already uneven out of the box."
4,Great All-In-One Measure,"I haven't given away my stainless steel dry measuring cups and they haven't made it into the garage sale pile. However, this is a perfect measure to use when you are dealing sticky or gooey things like honey, butter, shortening, and peanut butter. I like it because it produces a more accurate measure and it releases all the ingredient.This cup has multiple measuring scales on the side of the cylinder and is easy to use and clean. Hey, Alton Brown uses this on Good Eats. Initially I was a little skeptical about whether this would work the way it does through the wonders of HD TV, but it really does. It is an accurate and efficient measurement tool. If you are limited on storage space in your kitchen, this can be used instead of the cups and Pyrex liquid measures.While this is supposedly dishwasher safe, I hand wash it because it has a rubber seal."
2,clase 406 dvds,"I purchased these dvds to help my spanish and watched two episodes but haven't seen anymore as the storyline is brutal! IN the first two episodes someone is raped, another stabbed and someone goes to the clinic to check if they have an STD. This is a high school drama! It was a bit heavy for me...."
1,shipment of product,"It is with great sadness that I have been writing about this item.Actually do not know how the item is, because when he arrived was damaged in shipping the DVD's released from the box and scratched altogether.I believe the dvd's are good, but the product is not well-conditioned box.Indico when making a purchase request to enter some thing inside the box to separate the dvd's to prevent damage and can not watch the dvd'sAtt.Silone"
1,An exemplary service,Because an error in advertisement I received a wrong item. I waspromptly and fully recompensed.
2,EHhhh,"At times this book can be interesting, but mostly it's irksome. Several other reviewers have touched on the factual inaccuracies and numerous contradictions. I won't waste any more time on that, so I'll just mention that the writing is incredibly thin and weak, often making the book boring. His constant analogies when he compares players to musicians, basketball players, and other various public figures are pretty annoying, and one of them (the Charlie Parker one) really bugged me for some reason, probably because I doubt he could name a Parker song (though I have no way to back this claim up, it seemed like his source of information on Parker was wikipedia.)I also have a problem with the fact that he brings up Barry Bonds in nearly every player ranking, often when it's completely unnecessary. I get that you think he's a great player Elliott, but the stuff you write about him makes me think you're also in love with the man."
5,Incredible Relief ! !,"I bought this for upper back pain. You just lay on it and let all your muscles loosen.I always get an initial chiropractic ""crrruuuunnnccchhh"" when I first lay back on it.This board is so solid and supportive, that your back is forced to conform to it and since it bends your back in the reverse direction, within seconds all pain subsides. It is replaced by a wonderful, feeling of all stress floating away. This was the best thing I have ever purchased. I just cannot say enough about it."
1,Camera Buffs Save Your $$.,Checkout the Manfrotto 244 Variable Friction Magic Arm with Camera Bracket. It's much more sturdy and secure for much less money.
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
2,Not Very Good,"I bought one to try it on my LG Venus that I recently received, and I have to say that I am underwhelmed.One of the first faults toward these cables is that some headphones, when fully plugged in, will only produce sound in only one earcup. This is probably due to the fact that the female 3.5mm jack wasn't made very well. The problem is fixed if you slightly pull it out, but that's just stupid to live with.The next thing I notice is that this adapter is made with some sort of funky conductive metals. There are passages in music that completely cease to exist, as if the data is just terminated inside the adapter. This could also be in fact that the dac inside the Venus is horrible, but I am not sure for certain.Save yourself the money and look up another adapter would be my recommendation, but there might be some people that have headphones that work fully plugged in and they also like the sound that's coming out of it."
1,"BAD, DID NOT WORK!",I thought it was going to work with my blackberry pearl but unfortunately it did not connect.So it failed me.
4,"What it should be, not Xbox Compatible","I got this to try and use as an adapter for my Xbox 360 so I could use my 3.5mm headset with it. While the build quality of the adapter is good and I have no problems with the product itself it does not work with the Xbox, so if that's what you're looking for keep looking."
1,Be Careful - The picture shows 2.5 to 3.5. Specs are the opposite.,"Be careful to know what you need. The picture shows a 4-conductor 2.5mm to 3.5mm which is what I needed. However, the specs say 3.5 to 2.5 which is what they sent. Also, note that 3-conductor is for stereo headsets. 4-conductor is what you will need if using as a phone headset/microphone."
5,Headphone adapter,I purchased two of these adapters for two different Env2 phones and they work great.
3,Shelley,It tends to short out on one ear if I don't keep it positioned just right. It tends to get old to have to reposition it often in order to hear my music in both ears.
5,Works perfectly with Samsung Intensity II cell phone,"I purchased this adapter so my daughter could use her Sony stereo headphones that have a 3.5mm plug with her Samsung Intensity II cell phone (which has a 2.5mm jack) for listening to music. I had problems with other adapters not fitting properly because the plug on the Samsung is recessed slightly and the bulk of the plug did not allow complete insertion and some have a different wiring configuration to the rings on the plug that caused audio problems. THIS ADAPTER WORKED FLAWLESSLY. I also verified that it works with a microphone/headset for hands-free calling. As an added bonus the 90 degree angle on the male plug end makes the phone with headphones plugged in fit more easily in your pocket. This was well worth the price. Now that I know it works, I may need to buy a spare in case my daughter loses this one."
4,Love this cd.,"I ordered the cd for the songs I knew, but it's a great collection. I received it before the time expected. Exceptional service from Amazon."
3,Should be Mac OS X Tiger for Beginners ONLY,"Really basic stuff. If you're a complete newcomer to computers AND to Mac OS X, then this should fit fine. If you're already familiar with Windows, other books are probably better. I don't regret the purchase, but I'd hoped for a bit more depth."
5,Great Place for Financial Organizing,"I originally checked this book out from our local library, liked it so much, ordered one for myself, and a second copy for a friend. It makes getting one's financial life organized without becoming intimidating, simply by explaining a single easy step at a time. Very well researched, packed with great advice, and written in an informative tone without becoming condescending for those willing to invest a little time in order to get their financial lives in order. Ms. Quinn continues with top-notch investment advice and strategies easily understood - even for the ""finance-impaired""."
3,FIVE Mammoths,"Just a heads-up. This item is really FIVE identical mammoth toys. The size and weight are for all five of them together. I found that quite misleading. The toy itself is fine -- well detailed and sturdy. But the description is inadequate. I was expecting ONE very large mammoth, based on the size and weight information, not FIVE modest size mammoths."
3,Airport tycoon review,i like the games challenge and would like it to be compatable with 64-bit systemsall in all though it is enjoyable
5,Very practical and informative,"This book is grounded in Steve Hassan's personal experience of leaving the moonies and his massive efforts since then to provide education on how to help people leave destructive cults.It is informative and practical. I have used the advice in it to good effect and can vouch for the fact that it is a grounded and workable approach.In short, I strongly recommend it to anybody that needs to know more about destructive cults, how to leave them themselves or how to help others leave them.[...]"
1,Do not waste your money ...,"This ""e-doc"" is only 3 pages long and provides a completely general discussion of why an awareness of trading psychology is important. Completely useless to anyone but the most novice of traders."
4,Pretty good,Kinda bulky but now all my picture CDs and movies are in one place. Great storage for CDs.
2,Disappointed,"Amazon advertised this as a closed captioned product and it wasn't. For a severely hearing impaired person, this makes a difference. I would have loved to have watched the movies, but couldn't. I had to give the item as gift. Thanks for nothing, Amazon!"
2,A disappointment,"I'm crazy about the Holmes films, from today's Cumberbatch Sherlock series and the adaptations featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law all the way back to the early classics made by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. The Hound of the Baskervilles has long been a favorite (the Rathbone version and the Roxburgh/Grant version, which also features Ron Cook--perhaps the greatest Richard III ever filmed--in the understated role of Barrymore). This film however, was singularly boring and turgid, and I quickly gave it away."
3,Avoid the DVD!,The execrable sound track almost ruins this otherwise excellent film. I tried the subtitles only to find that whoever did them had more trouble with the sound than I did. The subtitle has an English gentleman of the nineteenth century going to visit an acquaintance in a TRUCK!
5,great book with visual aid and major league perspective,"This book offers major league insight from major league hitting instructors as well as hitting tips from stars like Chipper and Andruw Jones. The book methodically goes through every component of the swing from set up to follow through to mental approach. If you are struggling with your swing, trying to fine tune a part of your swing, simply improve your approach, or just learn the basics this book is very valuable. The photos of amatuer and pro hitters swinging and/or assuming their stances offer great feedback and support to the text description of the how to part of the book. I really believe this book could help any skill level hitter."
3,"A good read, but full of errors and omissions.","The very obsessive world of collecting Beatles recording variations was long devoid of a book on the subject and this was welcome when when it was published in the early '90's. Since then, Joe Brennan has published THE definitive list of Beatles recording variations online. As mentioned in the introduction to Mr. Brennans' site, this book is mostly based on previous lists and some conjecture. It's entertaining and contains some useful information and illustrations, but it is full of errors and omissions. At this date, I consider this book more of a collector's item, rather than a resource. If you are truly interested in a comprehensive list of Beatles recording variations, save your money and simply visit Joe Brennan's website."
5,Love it,My mother is from Cambodia. I bought her this book and she was so happy! The recipes are very easy to follow and delicious. Just seeing the pictures of fruit and other ingredients that she hasn't seen in 25 years brought my mom a lot of joy.
4,"Nicely Done, but...","Cambodians I have spoken with about The Elephant Walk Restaurant (upon which this cookbook is based) have been disappointed in the restaurant's high prices, and believe that much of the food does not represent traditional Cambodian fare. They have also commented on the lack of warmth exhibited by the owners towards less than aristocratic Cambodian patrons, and suggested the food has been modified to appeal to the American palate. As such, chances are you won't find many Cambodians eating at The Elephant Walk.Having said this, I have always enjoyed the flavorful and beautifully presented meals at The Elephant Walk Restaurant. The recipes in this cookbook look very tempting, and the photography is beautifully done."
1,Not Slip Resistant.,These are not for restaurant work. I was slipping and sliding all over the place. I nearly pulled my upper dorsimus.
4,Good for an Overall Outline,This book was a great outline to guide my studies. It made points clear and emphasized the important concepts. I used it as the main book for my behavioral medicine course and plan to use it for board review. I would recommend this to any student.
1,No mulitplayer...Stick with the demo,"My friends and I each bought a copy of this so we could play on a LAN and guess what, there is no multiplayer option (unlike the demo). The cd's are junk. Download the demo and be happy. If you still want one of these disks I have 3 I will give you for free, they are in my trash-can, you better hurry before I dump it."
4,Recently purchased; long listener,"I have just bought this CD. If you are into the mild rock that might make you feel up or down, then this is a good choice. Pretty powerful music that you can press rewind too. Too bad I'm the only person that likes the CD. Noone else I've talken to about this CD or played for them really went head over heals for it. Recommend purchase if you need new music in your collection and have an open mind."
4,Great Sad Bastard Music,"THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!!!!!! If you are looking for an alternative to the cheesy, thinly veiled ""dark"" pop albums that seem to be coming from all angles these days, check out ILYBICD, they are the real deal. It is really hard to avoid comparisions to Interpol, or the editors, and especially Joy Division here, because they are all valid comparisons, except for the fact that there is a darker underlying feel to this album that the others don't have. Where the Editors have a dark, heavily guitar driven sound, and interpol has its deeply synthesized sound coupled with very strange lyrical pairings, ILYBICD has an almost viceral sounds that would be moving even if you removed the music component, or vice versa. I would have to say that ILYBICD sounds more like an old Bauhaus album to me, with its dark imagery and alternating hard and light songscapes. A definite must have for anyone who considers themselves a fan of dark and melancholy music."
4,A good buy,Im sorry that the other reviewer did not have a good experience. We got this for our 2 year old (he is a small guy). It was very easy to put together. When he was 3 he had a better time with pedaling but they are still learning at that point. The wheels do occasionally spin going up hills and we have to give him a push. Every once in a while you do have to tighten the screws but you should anyways for safety. My son loves this bike and we love it for him. He is excited to get on it ever single time. Its never tipped over and has withstood many crashes. A great recommendation!!
5,Big Fan!,"I am an avid fan of Christina Stürmer. I wanted to add this to my collection. I love the song and the live version is a bonus!Even if you do not understand German, this song and her other albums are fantastic. She is just as beautiful as her voice.Amazing singer. Amazing voice. Amazing songs."
3,Knife surprise,"Purchased this set thinking I'd get a variety of great Wusthof knives, what I got was a block with a couple of good knives, not 8...if I'd have wanted serrated knives, I wouldn't have spent this kind of money...pretty disappointing."
2,"good lock, competitive price... but beware the cheap hardware...","Overall I'm impressed--but I gladly would have payed twice as much to get some decent hardware.I had BOTH of the installation screws shear in half... and it's not like I was installing the screw in hardwood, and I was barely exerting any force at all...Again, this gets too stars because they cheaped out on the screws. It was hardly a good bargain after I drilled out the sheared screws, filled with wood putty, waited for it to dry, repainted, bought some durable screws, and installed the lock.Bottom line: if you have extra mounting screws laying around this is a good buy. If you don't, don't waste your time."
1,This book is not for dummies,"I bought this book thinking I would be up and programming by the time finished it. Fat chance. It has refernces to files that are not on the cd. It explains things in bits and does not show complete application use. I had to go on-line to figure out what they were talking about and I am still not sure. The book should have taken a live active website using javascript and explain from the simplest to the most complex. Since I don't understand most of the uses, it is hard to apply the knowledge and it is impossible to do just a few simple things to start. If this book is for dummies then I need the version for the deaf, blind and dumb."
1,How does Vanderveer communicate with her readers?,"I am an M.D. physician (lots of time spent with professors who can't communicate). I have built a very nice website after reading the excellent HTML book from the ""Idiot"" series by Paul Mc Fedries. Sadly, this ""Dummies"" book by Vanderveer does a poor job of communicating the theory and technique of Javascript. I was drawn to the book, because the ""Dummies"" series seemed to be geared to real neophytes. After having gotten as far as Chapter 5 and understanding bits and pieces of the concepts, I have to give up. I don't miss the money spent on the book. The time wasted on the book, I can never buy back. I wish I had read the reviews on this website before I purchased the book. Now, onward, to find a good Javascript manual."
1,"Good Question and Answer Book , Bad If your just starting","I got JavaScript for Dummies and I didn't learn a thing. If you need a ref. book for JavaScript it might be a good idea to get , but if your just starting to learn try something else."
1,not a book for beginners,"I agree with most of the other reviewers who found this book very frustrating. The only ones who found any value already know some Javascript. It was about as interesting as a dictionary. The information might all be there, but I certainly could mot make any sense out of it. This book really did make me feel like a dummy. I wish I had read these reviews before"
1,I'll Stick With the Moron's Edition,"I have several complaints about this book. Firstly, the author assumes you don't even know how to turn on a computer. Who would be bothering to learn about JavaScript if they don't even know how to power up a PC? Come on! The author should spend less time detailing the basic boot up process on the PC and how to open your text editor, and more time explaining the way JavaScript works, and how it depends on the browser that the person visiting your website is using to work correctly. Also, a lot of the examples given in this book don't work. (Unfortunately, I've found that is common with JavaScript books.) Also, the book seems to waste a lot of time going on and on about useless nonsense. I know it's a ""dummies"" book, but this book expects its readers to truly be morons.I'm only thankful I purchased the book at a discount bookstore for only $3.99."
1,Read this and you'll feel like the title,"I can't believe some of the available reading that professes to assist newcomers. Read this book and by page 40 you will feel just like a dummy. Try Netsacpe Javascript 1.2 for an excellent learning experience. Their DevEdge site is also a wonderful experience for learning. Before buying any book, look here for customer previews. I wish I did."
2,Don't be a dummy. Don't buy this book!,"Ok. I may not be a techno geek, but I am not an idiot either. After reading this book, I was still in the ""fog"" about JavaScript. This is not a book for beginners of JavaScript, as the author does not teach the subject well.It was recommended to me that I look at:The Book of JavaScript by David ThauGuess what. It is a great book. The examples make sense. The reasons why things happen are explained in a way that a non programmer can understand!The entire book is like taking a class with an excellent teacher. The chapters are like assignments. In four chapters, I already know more than I did after finishing the ""Dummies"" book.If you want to have a book that you can just cut and paste code with a vague idea how it works, then Dummies book may work for you. However, if you want to have understanding of what you are doing, purchase:The Book of JavaScript by David Thau!Amazon.com won't mind. They sell both"
1,I must be a total idiot,"I'm a novice and I admit that if this is ""JavaScript for Dummies"" than I'm a bloomin' idiot!! If you are confident in your HTML skills, then you'll feel like you don't know anything after 5 chapters of this book. I kept waiting for the book to give ""assignments"" instead of high-level examples I'm not quite ready to decipher, yet.I'm returning this confidence-shatterer for David Flannagan's ""JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"", as it received good reviews."
1,Reads like scrap notes slapped together,"This book reads like it was slapped together from a small handful of quick notes. Actually, I would think someone could make better notes than that. The disc does not contain the example codes the book says it does. It's a rather expensive way to waste your time in an attempt to learn something. The explanations are weak and much too brief for a beginner or even someone with programming experience. I thought it would be a fun way to get started before I moved on to more advanced books, but it is incomprehensible and a great frustration to read. Buyer beware, and notice how poorly this book has been rated."
5,Excellent QuickReference .. a Must for JavaScript Programmer,This is a very good quick reference for readers who have just learned JavaScript and want a reference under their belts. The author does an excellent job in organizing the chapters. Finding subjects and information is easy. The book includes just the right amoutn fo information a quick reference should have.
4,Very easy to put together,"It came fast in the mail, considering that I used the free shipping from Amazon, it didn't take very long to get here. The cases are nice, my only complain so far would be that I got to cases but each one had a different power adapter, one with the standar plug, and the other with the funny one with the 4 pins.I haven't use them very often but they seem to work fine everytime I need them. I have them for backup purposes only so they work fine so far. I like the feature that you can connect either a SATA or ATA disk."
3,meh,"allowed for access, but theres nothing but a metal mesh between you and your drive, so if your drive is loud, get ready to be annoyed....construction felt flimsy too.. that said - it did what it said it would do..."
3,OK,"I usually by the GNC brand, I think I will go back. I have not noticed a change like I did with the GNC brand."
5,No longer available every place else....Amazon you saved the day!,"My husband had seen most of this film on tv and was interested in seeing the entire story, along with Inspectors 2. Every place we tried to purchase these no longer had them. We have actually been searching for over a year and finally found them. Interesting and well worth the price."
3,There are better offerings out there,"As a programmer who's been around the block more than once, I found this book made XSLT a lot more difficult than it needs to be. I had no previous experience with XSLT other than I knew what the acronym stood for. The examples get too difficult too quickly, and aren't very useful, in my opinion. The index is also pretty lousy, which makes learning a new technology difficult.The chapter about Toot-o-Matic, however, was pretty interesting. It made me realize that XSLT can be used for some interesting and complicated problems.I found ""XSLT Quickly"", published by Manning, to be a far better choice for someone with my level of XSLT experience. Perhaps I'll appreciate the O'Reilly title more when I have more experience."
5,very good,"the item ts good, I recommend the quality of the product I bought and I liked their quality is excellentlens, its aroma is good."
5,Fun Food,My daughters are really enjoying this food. They play with it daily. I am pleased with it because it was a choice that my child made on her own.
3,It's okay,"I mostly got this because I like the girl on the box cover & her strip tease was nice. There were one or two others I liked but there were also a lot of over-done boob jobs & bad faces IMO. For $5-10 if you know you like the names on the box, like the look of the cover model, and are looking for a stripper type video (nothing hardcore here - which I prefer) I'd say get it. Otherwise pass on it."
3,just a little dab more than does it,"While the blending of orange blossom and jasmine is luscious, this fragrance is a bit heavy for me. Perhaps I erred in buying the eau de parfum and should have purchased the eau de toilette. I've read that about three-fourths of eau de parfum is lost after several hours. That's not been my experience with Carolina Herrera. In fact, the aroma is still in the crook of my elbows until I wash it off, and it's as if I had just applied it. For many that may be a major attribute.However, my preference is for a much lighter scent - sort of a ""barely there."" While this fragrance is lovely, I wouldn't recommend wearing it to a concert or any place where you'll be in close quarters with others who may not want to enjoy your wonderful aroma.If your plans are for an evening in some secluded spot with a special someone - enjoy!"
1,UNPLEASANT,"The film on it's own is very interesting when viewed on decoder, but if you make the mistake of purchasing the DVD for keeps, it is not worth the stress because i already bought it and i regretted doing so.I purchased the film because i really enjoyed the it on TV but to my surprise, It was badly edited, a lot of the scene on the TV or decoders were removed, reasons i don't know. So you really need to have a rethink before purchasing this item because it is not worth the money paid for it."
1,"Five Star Material, One Star Production Value","These are Excellent stories. If you are one of the people who read Alan Moore's ""Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow"" Silver-age Superman Swan Song then you would definitely enjoy the stories in this collection. The emphasis needs to be that you will enjoy the STORIES, just not this collection. I was hoping to be able to get a collection of this wonderful material so that I would never have to remove my originals from the sealed mylar plastic bags which I have in various safety deposit boxes around the world, but the production quality that Checkerbook has employed is terrible. If you intend to read these stories just get the original copies, 27$ is too much to pay for such a sub-standard quality thrown together collection like I did."
2,What went wrong with this printing?,"I was very upset upon seeing the Checker edition of Supreme -- it looks like they copied this art directly from the comics. What Rob Liefeld didn't have film (or computer files) for these books? Or xeroxes? The results of the book look very blurry and cheap. I expected a nice tpb, so much for that. If you haven't read Supreme, it is worth reading. It's just too bad that more care wasn't put into this book full of wonderful story. A real pity."
4,"Size is about 50"" by 38""","When shopping I couldn't find the size of the maps listed. They are about 50"" by 38""."
4,Save on Amazon = zero,"The other reviews sum up the saw.Just to clarify, you don't save anything by buying it on Amazon.comThe cost here is the same as it is at your local big-box hardware store.You would save sales tax IF and only IF you live in a state that has sales tax and Amazon.com would not charge you the sales tax. Otherwise, your cost is the same.. though Amazon.com will deliver it to your door free of charge.. which is good, BUT if there is an issue and you need to return it, well that's a bit more complex then."
2,Bosch 9101-09 Table Saw from Amazon,"Saw is terriffic, not real impressed with Amazon/Warehouse Sales. Purchased as an open box item from Warehouse Sales. Did not ship for 4 or 5 days so had to have the item delayed at UPS center due to being out of town, cost $5. Saw did not have the bolts and nuts package to put together the easy rise table so had to call Bosch. They sent the bolts/nuts package to me free of charge but the package did not contain some of the correct bolts so had to purchase $10 of bolts/nuts at local hardware store."
1,Disappointed,"Like some of the others who purchased this saw from Lowe's, I thought this was a quality table saw made by Bosch. As a retiree who only uses it on occasion I had maybe 3 hours of running time on the saw when it suddenly stopped and started running slowly backwards. I've had it for two years, so no warranty. I asked a neighbor who used to rewind motors for a living, to take a look and he believed it was the control module, $45 with shipping, so I ordered and replaced it with the same result, runs backwards slowly. I've ordered the fields at another $65 and hope that will resolve it, but I fear I will be looking at another repair not too far down the road given the short life of the first motor. If you haven't purchased one, save yourself the aggravation and heartache of being without a saw when you most need it. It does have a dynamite stand, easy to collapse and move around. Maybe I can find a more reliable unit that can be mounted on it!"
5,awesome tool (but one problem),"This is a well built, and well designed tool. Smooth operation.And I'm pleased with the new features included in this model.The gaurd system is about as user friendly as anyone could ask for, although my crew is still reluctant to use it.BUT!I was totally irritated that it did not come with an assembly or operating manual. I had to print it out online, and it's about 80 pages long. I also had to print out the manual for the stand.A previous reviewer mentioned the same problem, and I'm wondering if this is Bosch's way to save a few bucks.I emailed the company and requested that they send me a copy, and they emailed me back a link to the download page. I emailed them again and requested that they mail me a hard copy. I haven't heard from them.For $600. they should include a manual!!!Update: They have now sent me manuals at two separate times. The last one came with a letter of apology, and a free saw blade and case. Nice."
1,doesn't work,I bought the product and it doesn't work. There is no product support....at least I can't find any.Wasted money!!!
5,Just as expected,"I bought ""Luna"" on a cassette tape about 15 years ago and loved it then. But with the changing times, it became apparent to me that I needed/wanted it on CD. And so I came to Amazon and found exactly what I wanted.It's a wonderful collection of rhythmic deep-centered compositions and has been quite helpful during my djembe practice sessions.By the way, Gabrielle Roth just passed away this week. I'm even more pleased that I have a lasting piece of her legacy."
5,Planet Earth,Awesome DVD series. Can't imagine that anyone would find this anything but incredible. So interesting and beautifully documented! Got it for my husband (he's a National Geographic fanatic)as a Christmas gift but the whole family has enjoyed it.
3,Don't buy it from amazon,"We have loved every minute of this series that we have been able to watch. My kids ask for it constantly and they all have their favorite parts. However, one of the discs (#3) was unplayable. No scratches or anything, but it just couldn't be read by our PS3, all the rest were fine. I borrowed a friends disc and his worked fine.Since we didn't get around to that disk until after 30 days we are just plain screwed apparently.Make sure you check each disc as soon as you get it."
5,Best Blu-ray Discs EVER,"perfect box set for anyone who wants to show off the clarity of their 1080P TV. super clear super crisp and narrator was David Attenborough and not the dull Sigourney Weaver. great buy, a must have for any playstation3/blu-ray player owner."
2,Planet Earth,"I think I got a bad batch. Disc 2 in my set isn't recognized by my HDDVD player although all the others are. This was a brand new set, but something must have gone wrong when the disc was formatted. I love the video, but I'm bummed about a lemon set."
4,"Beautiful, stunning and sometimes very creepy","This series is breathtaking. There will be a number of times when they show One-of-a-kind animals found in some cave only in waterfalls at nighttime, during a winter storm... and you'll have to wonder: How did they get this footage?And educational to boot! The queasy may want to skip the insects and slimy stuff!"
5,Love it!,"Absolutely love Planet Earth!! Highly recommend - everyone should watch this series. Not something you get tired of, you can watch it over and over again. The discs are divided into segments that are easy to watch in a sitting - time flies by. Fascinating series and each chapter is never exactly as I expected. You won't be bored, or disappointed."
5,fastest shipping perfect gift!,"received planet series new as promised and faster than expected. B-day gift for my 98 year old grandfather, he was thrilled! I would definately order from this seller again. Thank you!"
3,What's so great about it?,"I love watching Nature, Cosmos, and other documentary type programs. This one was so hyped up, I perhaps expected too much. This program was lauded for its wonderful photography, etc, but so far I haven't found it to be unusual. I gave it an average rating, as it simply didn't hold my interest, and the photography is average for this day and age."
2,Sigourney Weaver is not the narrator!,"This is narrated by David Attenborough, not Sigourney Weaver. So if you're expecting the same smooth voice that you heard on the Discovery Channel you will be disappointed.Nothing against David Attenborough, but when you're expecting one thing and get something else it's a little disappointing. They advertise it starring Sigourney Weaver but say at the bottom of the advertisement that it's narrated by David Attenborough.Other than that, it's the same as what the Discovery channel showed. Beautiful scenery and a wonderful show."
3,I returned it,"I returned this DVD for a couple of reasons.1. The balance between D.A.'s voiceover and the music was WAY off. Granted, my DVD player isn't the greatest, but it plays movies just fine. On this DVD, especially on the first disc, you really couldn't understand most of what Attenborough was saying. Unless, you turned the volume up so far the music blew you out of the room. For some reason, this was not as bad on subsequent discs.2. The box says ""5 disc set"" or some such. The 5th DVD was a propaganda piece on ""Global Warming"" -- not information, just opinion. So what you really get is a 4 disc set plus some BS."
5,Beautiful series... I have some clarifications,"There seemed to be some confusion to which version this is. I bought it from Amazon and not a third-party, I recieved the 4 Disc BBC version for distribution in the US. Some people believe the video is 1080i (interlaced) and not 1080p. They would think this because the box says 1080i, HOWEVER, I've looked at the mt2s files contained on the Bluray disc through a codec analyzer and it contained no information about it being interlaced. Also With interlaced video there is the obvious ""mouse teeth"" or jaggedness seen most noticable durring fast motion and when you pause. I've look through many frames, paused, started, and took a hard look at the video. There is no interlacing. Its definatly 1080p like the other BBC released versions, likely just a missprint on the box.Other than disputes of the video type the series is perfect. I was amazed. I didn't look to see if there were extras or not, I don't really care about extras. I just wanted to main series."
1,Planet Earth,"Well considering that I don't have the product it will be pretty hard to review it. This would be the third time I have written you regarding the fact that I paid $120+ for two copies of Planet Earth on DVD, and I STILL DON""T HAVE THEM!!!!!!!!!! Is there no one there? Is there a human at the other end of this computer who could possibly send me my two copies of Planet Earth on DVD. You really don't want my review of your service at this point!Thank You"
3,good,i already own the planet earth series and bought this as a gift. i was a little disappointed when i received it because there were only 4 discs in this series whereas mine has 5. i'm not sure why the difference but i wish the description had let me know how many discs there were before i purchased it.
5,"Great series, but check your 4th disc!","This is a great series, however I just discovered that the 4th disc in my set is a standard DVD disc instead of the Blu-Ray disc! The set was shrink-wrapped and looked new when I got it, so this could be a manufacturing error. So make sure you check all of your discs for the Blu-Ray logo!On the plus side, I did get to see some of the content that the high def. versions are missing because of this slip-up (I can't understand why this extra content was removed from the HD-DVD / Blu-Ray versions)...Anyway, just wanted to warn people that it's possible that some copies of the set may have the wrong discs."
5,Amazing!,Now I just duct tape my mouth shut when I sit down to watch one of the episodes of this wonderful nature series. Otherwise my jaw would just keep dropping due to the incredible shots the BBC has put together. The mating ritual of the birds of paradise is just about worth the entire price tag.
2,BEWARE NOT FOR GENTLE KIDS,"Sadly, this is a Harry Potter style documentary about the vaaaasst mysterioussss deaddddlyyy planet Earth. It also mimics the style of Hollywood I guess in trying to impress the teenager or 20 something year old male. When you turn the Harry Potter sound off the camera is amazing. But still nothing for gentle nature loving children, the makers of this documentary for some reason forgot about them."
1,Disappointed,I was looking forward to this series and ordered the high definition set. We have a high def tv but not a high def dvd. I thought it would work any way but it did not. I then gave the set to my son-in-law because they have a high def dvd. He could not get it to work either and so the whole set is useless. I think there should have been some sort of highlighted explaination as to what would work on all the dvd's out there. Now the set is useless and I am not happy.
5,Fantastic!!!,I've no words to well how excellent is this documentary... it's a crime not to have it!! 100% recommended.
1,I would love to be able to give a fair review...,"But the entire pack of discs was unplayable because of damage. Purchased from the Amazon marketplace, however amazon customer service took great care of me. I have become hesitant about purchasing optical media from Amazon lately, if the customer service weren't so good I would never again purchase a disc of any kind from the site. In the span of a month 5 different discs arrived loose and scratched badly. The situation has always been resolved quickly and to my satisfaction though so I can't fault Amazon for that. The few minutes of footage that worked looked amazing and sounded quite good on my 5.1 system. I can't comment on the actual product much further than that...the packaging was attractive I guess."
3,Marred by nutcake alarmism,"Wonderfully filmed and awe-inspiring, but marred by unscientific nutcake alarmism (""the icecaps are melting! it's our fault! aaargh! the penguins are dying! Aaargh!"") - search for junkscience or see Inhofe's site for the scientific rejection of this religious ranting. Also, necessarily vague Darwinist pablum is randomly tossed in. If you can ignore this religious material and focus on the real science, you're in for a treat."
1,didn't work,"HD DVD didn't work in my HD DVD player, or a regular player, or a blu-ray player. that's what I get I guess"
1,"No package, No response, No service. Don't order from GoHastings!","Ordered the Blu-ray ""Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series"" on November 30, 2009. GoHasting said they shipped it on 12/01/09. I did NOT receive it. You are not allowed to contact the company except by email. They don't respond! They already have your money. They don't send your order. You're basically screwed. When I inquired with Amazon Customer Service they said that I should have NEVER orderd from GoHastings because they have a BAD TRACK RECORD. How was I to know that? They said any company under 97% should NOT be trusted. Buyer beware. Don't get ripped off like I did. I have not had any problems ordering direct from Amazon so if you want to have a Merry Christmas then don't do business with GoHastings."
1,It might be great if it worked,The HD format does not work in our home theater system. So I cannot recommend it. It would be helpful if there was some information in the products details that helped tech novices buy the right format.
1,Never got item,"Waited a month for item, then finally contacted the seller who said he couldn't mail the item and would refund my money instead. It has been a week now, and I am still waiting on the money. Awful!"
5,Fantastic experience.,"If you have an HD ready TV, you can discover the possibilities of your TV with this documental. Is a great experience to enjoy. It has marvellous images. You can imagine you stay in that enviromental really."
5,This video is one you just have to own,"This video is for a lack of a better word ""amazing"". You and your children will witness all the natural wonders of the world and will learn so much about it. Do yourself a favour - buy it!"
5,Absolutely Amazing,"You watch ths program, and you just thinking of the greatness and nagnitude of God and the absolute beauty of His creation. You will be in awe throughout the entire series. Footage is incredible and you just think of how blessed we are to live in an age where we can see things that no one before us could have witnessed (in totality). This series is spectacular. What I also love about it is that you can watch it with your kids. My 1 and 2 year old absolute love it as much as me and my husband do. Scenes of chases and kills are done tastefully so it doesn't frighten children, yet still close up so that you get the full picture. I cannot recommend this enough. Its great. I'm looking forward to gettingThe Blue Planet - Seas of Life Collector's Set (Parts 1-4)as well."
5,Great documentary but jerky playback,"We saw some of the episodes on TV here in Australia and bought the set to watch the rest. Really stunning.There is one problem though, some of the playback, especially aerial footage, is sort of jerky... I wonder if it is an issue with the discs or our Yamaha DVD player... certainly never seen that before.Glad if anyone could shed some light.CheersGeorgie"
5,Awesome footage!,Gave this to my dad for Christmas...he loves it! Shipping was very fast & item received in perfect condition. Highly recommend!
5,Totally amazing,"All I have seen by today is 5 charters, and I am attonished by this spectacular production. It has inspired me to have very nice thoughts about our reason to live in planet Earth."
5,Planet Earth BBC Received,This was a Christmas gift and I didn't realize at the time that there are 2 different Planet Earth narrators. I noticed all packaging didn't have the same exact graphics but thought it was just the number of disks.
3,It's not region free,"I bought this set along with the Sylvania NB530SLX. The disc are not region free, they are region B. If you have bought any Blu Ray player in the US, then you can't view those disc. This is my first blu ray player, I bought it without knowing about the region situation."
1,Planet Earth,Extremely dissappointed. Can't watch this video because the technology change. They should have told me before I bought it.
2,Too Graphic,Too much animal eating animal. What a waste.What was in the creators mind? Does he think the people who buy his video like that?He could have had an great video.Instead he ended up with tripe.
3,Amazing DVD but where are the Diaries?,"I bought a blu-ray player and HD TV almost exclusively to see this amazing series. Attenborough and the BBC crew take you places few people have ever seen. I wasn't disappointed in the HD quality of this collection. It's truly amazing, but isn't the whole point of a multi-layered, high-density, media like blu-ray to pack as much stuff on a disc as possible? If you already had the ""Planet Earth: Diaries"" ready to go, why on Earth would you leave them off? Having seen the ""Diaries"" on Netflix DVDs, I have to say, this series is incomplete without them. I'm so disappointed in the BBC for leaving them off. And I'm a little disappointed in Amazon for not telling me this isn't the ""Complete"" series."
2,Wait for a better transfer and more features,"I was eagerly anticipating the release of this series and it is quite stunning to watch some scenes, however the quality is not up to my expectations. Honestly, Fantastic Four was a better transfer... Many scenes are extraordinarily grainy, e.g. Freshwater (Disc 1, Title 4, Chapter 1, 1:30-1:45)Second, it would be nice to have the option of selecting alternate narrations... the Attenborough narration is a little monotone and he sounds out of breath most of the time... apologies to any Attenborough fans.Missing special features on Blu-Ray compared to DVD... come-on... what kind of half-baked nonsense is this? You're supposed to sell us on the Blu-Ray capabilities not give us LESS (I know we get more pixels... I'm not talking pixels... I'm talking minutes of video content).My setup: PS3 HDMI to Samsung 40"" LCD 1080i"
2,warning,"The 5 discs version is 1080i (25GB) while the 4 dics one is 1080p (50GB). I made the mistake of ordering the 5 discs version, the video quality is poor for a BR, not even as good as the upscaled DVD."
3,not 1080p as shown on the box,"Just received the product and to my surprise the video format is 1080i instead of 1080p as shown on the website ....zoom in on the back of the box picture. I am returning it with disappointment. BTW, I have seen the 1080p version and the experience is just outstanding. If you can get the 1080p and have a full 1080p TV with Blu Ray....this is a ""must watch"" for the family."
1,Was very excited to order this item,"I ordered this for a specific occasion. That occasion came and went without the item being received. Amazon.com suggested I make a trip to the Post Office to check on it. This would have completely defeated the purpose of ordering on-line. Needless to say, I did not follow their suggestion. Bottom line - I cancelled the order and bought the item locally."
5,ABSOLUTELY MESMERIZING !!!!,"I currently do not own this series , but i watched the 1st disc the other night... and i still can not believe how great this show is. The photography is outstanding, the aerial shots are breath taking, the composition is fantastic and the visual eye candy is totally addicting. It is by far, the best HD MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN.Not only is this highly recommended, but it is a must have series... and is the best BLU-RAY movie to show off to friends... and educational. =)"
5,Stunning photography!,"This DVD series was well worth the wait. The stunning photography in this original BBC version of Planet Earth is enhanced by the narration of Sir David Attenborough. Although Sigourney Weaver does a good job narrating the U.S. version of this documentary, she is not David Attenborough!"
5,Must Have for HDTV,"This Blu-ray disk is spectacular and proves to me that my purchase of a Samsung 52"" 1080P LCD TV was worth the money! You can watch this over and over and it still is as good as the first time. Amazing footage of places and animals that have never been seen by most of us. A must have for everyones HD collection."
5,Planet Earth,Just simply an amazing series. I own the series on the oceans which is what inspired me to buy this and they are both so very worth while.
5,Fantastic,"The most impressive and informative presentation we have ever experienced. The entire family gathers together each evening to both learn more about and enjoy our world through the DVD series, ""Planet Earth"". It will be in our library for others to enjoy as well."
2,World Tour for the ADHD-Afflicted,"This is a terrific DVD tour of our world, if you have a very short attention span. The clips are too short and too disjointed, in my view. My kids loved it. But, they have ADHD! I found the jumps from topic to topic irritating and dread the kids saying, ""can we see the next disc?"""
5,Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray],"I gave this Series to my son as a Christmas gift, and while visiting him over the holidays I was able to watch two of them with his family. It's absolutely stupendous, and we were all, down to the youngest child, completely captivated by the incredible photography and the information presented. And BBC did not dumb it down, like the American version. Watch-learn-enjoy!!"
4,"Great films, lousy disk holder","Planet Earth by the BBC on Blu-ray has received rave reviews by many folks and hardly needs another by me. In a word, it is awesome. However, the mechanical design of the disk holders is terrible. I almost break the disk each time I remove a disk from its holder. The center catch is just too stiff and no matter how hard I push on it the disk doesn't release. There are several superior center holder designs, why doesn't the industry settle on the few that work and stopping using the ones that don't?"
5,Consider this your Blu-Ray demo disc.,"The series is very informative and entertaining, but it also serves as the perfect demo disc to show off the ""Blu-Ray Experience""."
5,Planet Earth DVD's,Fabulous photography and fascinating narration - well worth purchasing - we greatly enjoyed this series...
2,Planet Earth,"I ordered, sent back and reordered this DVD. None of them would play on my new DVD player. No problems with anything else that I currently have or have rented. Waste of my time."
3,Not the same without HD,"I've been watching this series on Discovery HD and it is breathtaking. I ordered the DVD as opposed to the HD DVD because we don't have an HD DVD player and I didn't think there would be much difference. Was I wrong! If you've been watching the series on HD, you've been spoiled like myself and you will be very disappointed by the quality of the picture in the plain DVD. I'm now going to get the HD DVD and save it for when we upgrade our player."
1,Buyer Beware!,I purchased this dvd for my granddaughter for Christmas 2010. She has just opened it and there are no discs in the box.!!! Ugh!Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series
5,Planet Earth,"The product arrived as promised on time and in excellent condition. I presented to a friend as a gift. They really enjoyed it, worth buying and passing on to others. Thanks, Colleen"
5,Planet Earth DVD set,"This is a superb work! the photography is amazing and one of the best presetations to help us who never get to the locations in the world that they captured and preserved for us. The extras that they included that go behind the scenes to show how they did their photography work is fascinating. The perspective on the thousands of creatures in some of the scenes is awe inspiring and a strong reminder of the vastness of God's creation on earth.The final disk has a valuable role in helping us understand the seriousness of the environmental and species conditions developing around the world. It certainly should help overcome many skeptic's views that we are damaging the world that God gave us to care for and use wisely. Hopefully more of the viewers of this set will come to realize our need to do better at ""Creation Care."""
5,Mesmerizing,Thank God for David Attenborough and the BBC for presenting this fascinating and important series. Utterly captivating without pandering to short attention spans.
5,A Visual and educational masterpiece,This series is a pure masterpeice of television documentary. There has been nothing like it since the invention of television This is a must buy. period.
5,A whole new world opens up,"The first disc alone is worth the price of admission! The Great White launching out of the water in slow motion capturing its prey was outstanding photography! I highly recommend this video to all ""earthlings"" who want an intimate view of the earth from a different perspective"
5,Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray],One of the best series I have bought on DVD. This BBC series showcases our natural world in a light but informative way and should appeal to viewer's at all levels of interest in our natural world. I would relish the opportunity of purchasing this series in 3D please.
5,Visually Stunning and Incredibly Informative,"If you are into nature documentaries and have a decent rig (HDTV, Middle-of-the-Road DVD player, Surround sound system), then this series will amaze you! Brilliant insight into ecosystems that are rarely seen, much less recorded in high definition. There are also sporadic behind the scene sub-documentaries that expose how the photographers (adventurers) capture the videos that will leave your mind blown. Superb DVD set!!"
5,Untouchables S4V1,Amazing. The only drawback is that it has not the Spanish soundtrack. Elliot Ness' voice is much better in the Spanish version.
2,What happened here?,"This looks like a bad bootleg -- the opening sequences look wrong, and cheesy, and the music is terrible! Also the plots have holes big enough to drive trucks through, but I guess the show had run out of steam by year four.But what the heck is with the crummy titles and truly awful music??? I'm glad I'm not the only one to have noticed ..."
2,lame to say the least,season 4 was very tame for this series-gunfire was kept at a minimum--thats probably why there was no season 5-very little action and NO frank nitti-the italians finally won out-the politically correct crowd won this one and killed a good show-THIS season did NOT in anyway compare to the other 3--which was action packed--i bought it just to complete the seasons set--but VERY DISAPPOINTED--same goes for vol 2
1,99% worthless,"I found this tape completely useless. Easy to get off the roll, but not very much stick. Perhaps you'll find more use for it than I did, but my recommendation is to keep looking."
2,"Awful, Awful, Awful","although book 1 of 'Black Fleet Crisis' is the best of the three, dont waste your time. It only gets worse. The characters we've come to know and love are totally out of whack. I struggled through these books just so i can get to Zahn. Its not a must read, and unless you want to bore yourself, dont read this."
1,Glum and Blah,"I own and have read this entire trilogy, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time or money. It is a very slow read, and quite inconsistent with the rest of the Star Wars universe. The story in and of itself isn't bad, but combined with the writing style and carelessness of the author, gets prertty borring. For example, a lot of the story is focused on Lando and Lobot, while good chunk of the action is taking place elsewhere. Actually, it put me to sleep quite a few times, which says something about an intense Star Wars fan. The recaps that take place in the other books more than make up for what you will miss if you do not read these books."
4,Good Trilogy,"The Black Fleet Crisis trilogy is one fun read. It goes deep into the feelings of Luke and Leia sepearately and explores their problems, making them much more detailed characters. As for the bad guys in this trilogy...PURE EVIL. Written so well I was shocked. I recommend this trilogy to all Star Wars fans that are reading the novels."
2,Non-cannon Star Wars and mischaracterizations ruin this book,"While looking at the story outside of what would be considered Star Wars cannon, it is not that bad. However, any serious Star Wars fan will be so distracted by the utter lack of knowledge McDowell displays in regards to the Star Wars universe.Examples: Coruscant is portrayed as a Garden planet? Lucas Arts clearly indicated that Coruscant was one big city, long, long ago in it's X-Wing series. This book was written recently enough to have gotten this right. This is one minor example of lack of continuity in this book.The other aspect of this book that killed it for me was how the main cast was mischaracterized. I thought Leia's portrayal was especially bad. A very strong female character was completely weakened.To close, I was so disappointed with this book I am seriously considering not reading the rest of the trilogy. What really surprises me is that Lucas Film let this book be written with all of the cannon errors."
2,"Going, going ... short.","Not that the story is short though. This story really should've ended with book one. Instead McDowell wrote three. The story starts out with basically three plots: Leia, Lando, Luke(LLL). All three start out very interesting and demand the readers attention. However, Luke's journey and search for his mother is completely ridiculous. He jumps arround from one dead end to the other, simply nothing happens (utter frustration). As for Lando, once they get on the vagabond, nothing happens either. They never gain control of the vessel or use it in any way. They might as well have not gotten on. Everyone seems to be sitting around. Leia's plot dealing with politcal challenges and Han is the remaining and redeeming factor in this series. If you read book one, don't worry if you never finish the series. The end, which I've tried not to spoil, is incredibly anticlimatic."
2,Serious plot contradiction here!!,"This would have been a very good book except for that it was unfortunately published before ""The Phantom Menace"" came out. The reason that's so bad is because it talks about Luke Skywalker's mother. In this book and the next two that follow it, instead of Queen Amidala of the Naboo, her name is Ashira of the Fallanassi; a people who have remained mysterious for a very long time, and nobody that young Anakin Skywalker would ever want to hook it up with. It's unfortunate, but I don't blame the author for this; it wasn't his fault. Also, I really liked the bad guys; Nil Spaar's ""Humans are vermin"" attitude makes him so despicable you want to jump in an X-Wing (or in this case, an E-Wing) and show him vermin!"
4,Not bad.,"Kube-McDowell has done something new and different in a universe that was getting to be more of the same. He's written a serious, believable sci-fi extrapolation of the trilogy, rather than essentially rewriting it with a few changes. The politics are real and believable. The characters have changed and evolved. The suspense and excitement are created through a well thought-out, built up plot rather than chase scene after chase scene. Unorthodox, to be sure, but impressive, and original."
4,"Very Generic Plotline, but with an ok twist","This manga, DearS, is very similiar to every other ""boy finds robot/alien/whatever girl"" type of a story... where the predictable quasi-girl acts as some kind of a temptress and the guy is not like any man on this planet, and somehow, through stupidity usually, acts like a jerk to the girl. So, with that in mind, this is almost like every other manga ever made... Chobits, Saber Marionette J, Mahoromatic, AI Love You, Tenchi, and the list goes on.If you like those types, then this may be worth the read. But, I mean, if you were able to read all those I listed above and still not become sick of this genre. This story has some very weird parts of the story where you may have no clue what is going on, but like every story that follows that same general plot, it has some interesting stories and character interactions. As well, I give a thumbs-up to the art... probably a little bit more risque than the recommended 13 and over, but still good."
5,good reference book,"i keep this book right by my side and i read other books about the jfk assassination.when i come across a new name,i find the name in my a to z reference book and read a quick summary that gives me a fairly complete picture om who this person is."
1,I wouldn't know,"I never received the product because the dingy broad that works for the post office screwed up didn't deliver it to my address because I get other peoples mail all the time, and since it was ""delivered"", I'm the one that's screwed out of my money."
4,Great...when they just play...,"I really enjoyed the instrumental portions of the songs, but the singing and rapping was unneccesary. I was expecting more of a hip-hop jazz album. It's still good, but I hope their next album drops the cheezy vocals and sticks to what they do best. Play those violins!!!!"
2,What happened,"When Nuttin but Stringz played on TV, the most beautiful sounds I have heard resonated out of their violins so I rushed and bought a CD. This CD does not come close to what they are capable of. I hope one day they will get it together."
2,Surprised and confused,I purchased this CD thinking it was going to be all instrumental due to what I had heard from them in the past. A few songs are but the majority of the CD is them talking while playing almost like a rap song. Very disappointed.
3,"Not bad, but was expecting more","I was hoping for more instrumental, less ""real life"" word play, etc. Overall still happy with the purchase but it's not The Piano Guys."
4,Wish there was more,"The violins were great, but wished they emphasized it more in their music. Would love to see them do their own take on classical pieces."
5,nuttin but stringz,I bought this cd for my sister and she has not stopped talking about it. She has put it on the p.a. system at the school where she teaches and all her co- workers are crazy about it. I am now buying my own copy because I can't seem to pry it out of her hands. Amazing work by these 2 young artists.
5,The New Rave in Music,"This is a very different take of music that i have been longing for. The music is sultry with the talented sounds of violin. You only have to hear one song and you'll be hooked. The two brothers are so good, and i will treasure this cd for the rest of my life."
2,Nuttin but talk,I was sorely disappointed with this CD. I thought it was going to be classic Nuttin But Stringz with the fabulous rock violin music that made them famous. Boy was I wrong. I heard some violin music in the background but this CD is mostly rap and talk with very little great music. I gave it away without listening to it more than once.
3,"Violin Playing = Excellent, Rapping/Singing = Ruins the purpose of the band's talent","These guys amused me with their talent on America's Got Talent especially with the energy they play with. I was really excited when I got the album but that turned out to a disappointment. Those guys are great violinists and that is why I bought the album! The songs in the album just have a lot of singing to it, making me think I bought a rap/R&B album. Could have listened to R Kelly instead =S. I see that bad for them since it blocks the listeners concentration to their violin playing. Don't get me wrong, having those little singing parts such as in Thunder is great and make them unique, but singing in the whole track is just too much. I hope they focus on the energetic and passion violin playing rather than becoming rappers."
5,I LOVE IT!!,"I never knew she'd be *this* good especially with this debut single. i like her vocals, she has talent...not just in singing obvioulsy! I really like the other mixes on the single also, really upbeat. I dont think i could get tired of this song! :) i'll look forward for more stuff from her."
1,! IF YOU HAD THE VOICE ! IT WILL BE BETTER,"Come on people! What is going on man? , because you have a beautifull body, it dosen't mean that you can sing girl,Because you acted out as SELENA once that doesn't make you a superstar like she was. I think that Jenni should go back and make some more movies , I really like her as an actress . And for you out there I am only saying what I feel."
5,Funny,"Various happenings that occur when at grandmas house. Hilarious situations and a reminder of our grandparents time. Good for all ages, especially adults,"
4,this is a great book!!,"We were actually assigned this book in school. I wasn't that happy about reading it, but once I started reading it, I loved it! Richard Peck does an awesome job of mixing humor with serious situations in the story. This book takes place over several years, each year very different from the previous year. The story is about the realationship between a brother and sister and grandmother, and how every summer they visit their grandmother, who lives ""A Long Way from Chicago"". Let me give you a hint about a main event in the story: it has to do with the cover of the book. Happy reading!"
4,Out of Ordinary!,"Can you imagine having an adventure with your grandma? Joey and his sister, Mary Alice, spent not only one but several week-long summer vacations with their intelligent grandma in a small Illinois town. Different from living in the big city, Chicago, Joey and Mary Alice become acquainted with many interesting people in the town. ""You wouldn't think we'd have to leave Chicago to see a dead body"" as Joey begins his first adventure story.A Long Way from Chicago by Richard Peck consists of seven short stories of Joey and Mary Alice's summer trips between 1929 and 1942. Narrated in Joey's adult voice, the novel transports the unexpected adventures one after another to readers without having them leave home. The sense of humor and some of the surprising solutions make the novel a pleasurable read."
4,A Search for the Genetic Marker for Huntington's Disease,"This is a mesmerizing and well-written book by a woman whosefamily has a history of Huntingon's Disease. This disease isdeadly and kills in a slow and very tortuous manner. She be-comes very involved in finding the genetic marker for thisdisease.How she views her family, her final decision not to take thetest to see if she carries the Huntington's gene, and theemotional impact of carrying her fear is both poignant anddisturbing. She sure can write."
5,Hard water stains GONE!,I must say this pumice toilet bowl ring remover was absolutely amazing. I honestly didn't believe the other reviews where they said it cleaned a years old dirty toilet and made it look new. I will have to say the toilet that was being cleaned will need several of these pumice toilet bowl ring removers to get it sparkling clean but now it did an absolutely amazing job and highly recommend this.Like I said this didn't clean the whole bowl because the toilet had multiple years worth of hard water buildup on it so I will need at least two more of these to completely scrape all the hard calcium deposits off the toilet bowl. But I will say it was well worth every penny. I think I'm going to have to buy the 24 pack.
5,If You've Got Rings In YOur Toillette Buy This Product!,Over the counter sprays and no amount of scrubbing would remove the rings on my toilette bowls. I highly recommend this product and it is easy to use. The product reminds me of an Emory board to file your nails or the bottom of your foot. It grinds away the ring from your toilette with little effort.Pumie Toilet Bowl Ring Remover #TBR-6
5,Works Great,"This really does work great on hard water stains in your toilet, bathtub, sink, and faucets. Where I live there are so many chemicals in the water that in less than a week it looks like like my toilet hasn't been cleaned in years....this removes them quickly!"
5,5 independent alarms -- full of features,"Pros: Inexpensive watch with many features. Lightweight.I bought this watch because of the 5 independent alarms. That's why I prefer this watch to my other watch that cost 5 times more. I have a PDA and cell phone, but I'm always leaving them somewhere.Cons: Only water ""resistant"", and the plastic case feels a little cheap."
3,"OK, but buttons toggle modes too readily","Perfectly good watch for the price, but the buttons that toggle the AM-PM vs 24 hr presentation is much too easy to click accidentally (eg by snagging on a shirtsleeve), so that whichever mode you prefer, you'll find that half the time you're in the other. That's annoying enough. Even worse is that the button that toggles savings time is also far to easy to click accidentally. Even though you have to push the button for some two seconds for it to toggle, that turns out to be not so hard to do. And then your watch is off by an hour, and the only clue is a very very tiny ""DST"" or ""EST"" text in a corner."
1,Good watch- bad watch band,Very nice watch for the price. The watch band was a piece of garbage. I spent an hour trying to get to work and then returned it.
3,Intermittently good,"The good: keeps almost perfect time, is easy to see, and looks pretty good.The bad: the watch has failed four times in the last two years (since I bought it). Twice, it spontaneously reset itself. Twice the screen went blank, but came back (with the data gone) after I opened the case, and jiggled the innerds (OK, not very scientific, but as far as I felt competent to go.) I liked the idea of a databank so that I could store limited static information ""at my fingertips"". However, I have not bothered to reload the data since I would probably have to do it all over again the next time it fails. Maybe I just got a lemon (with an intermittent battery connection).My previous databank was very reliable and also kept perfect time, but eventually (after ~4 years) broke where the band pins enter the case."
1,bad time keeper,THIS WATCH LOOKS VERY NICE AND ALSO HAVE GOOD PRICE.THIS WATCH RUNS GOOD .BUT THERE IS ONLY AND ONLY ONE PROBLEM THAT TIME SKIPS BY HOURS BECAUSE (I WEAR WATCH ON MY LEFT HAND)THE REASON IS THE TIME ADJUSTING NOBS PRESSED BY ITSELF WHEN I DO SOMETHING WITH MY HAND AND THAT SKIP TIME BY HOURS.THIS IS THE REASON I AM GIVING ONE STAR TO THIS WACTH.
5,Great Watch at great price,The Casio watch has enough features to to please anyone and has a 10 yr battery. When the combine the features and the battery life this watch can't be beat at the price $26-30.
3,A nice lamp & a great company,"I had a problem with my lamp in May 2005. I had it since August 2004 when my second son was born. The switch had somehow melted downward and began to smoke. When I contacted Babies r Us they said that they couldn't help me & to call Lambs & Ivy, which I did the next day. They were extremely cordial & professional. They shipped me a new lamp in no time. I love my ""All Stars"" set and I highly recommend it for those expecting boys! I use the nightlight as well as the regular lamp on a daily basis."
1,Don't waste your time.,"For the second time in two months, a trojan that is known to the majority of all other AV vendors, but not known to Symantec, has invaded my network. This time it was a variant of Rbot/SDbot. I had to download AVG AntiVirus to remove this item. Symantec was set to auto-protect and nightly scans, yet this trojan was merrily uploading away until I noticed it in my traffic monitor.According to SAV, I've never been infected by anything. Batting 0 for 2 now, that's not a good track record for me. It's going in the trash bin. I'm just glad I'm not the one who paid for it - my university provides it with a corporate license (this is the closest version I could find to review)."
1,Former Language Student,"Im a former language student and now teach my language to mostly children, while also using that foriegn language daily. I am no professor and I HAVE had the ( exceedingly hard work ) experience of learning a foriegn language.Every (academic or otherwise ) language course I ever attended ( and there were plenty, in Japanese Chinese and Indonesian..)was in no way even remotely related to the 'literary interests' of the professors.( all of whom spoke at least one language, often up to 6 languages other than their own.)Ive known several REAL diplomats in my time, and none would be dumb enough to make the below mentioned comments, by the 'DIPLOMAT'.It seems to me, that the diplomat is A ;a non person, B; working for the publisher directly, to C;give a rave review, and D; mislead the book buying public with claptrap. And further that E; we should all be VERY suspicious of this publisher and its 5 star reviews. And lastly F; Amazon should do something about these people."
2,Pass on this one,"I agree with the other reviewers. My 4 year-old daughter is big on Barbie, but the doll's hair is difficult to comb, the clips fall apart, and the doll falls over when you try to comb her hair."
2,Different from Mac version,The book is composed of hard to see screenshots with commentary. The screenshots and descriptions are quite different form the Mac OS X version. It was somewhat helpfull but there are sites online that do a better job.
3,Decent product,"These are decent pants. The wide elastic band is very comfortable. I had to modify the length and bell of the pants as they are a bit ""disco"" for my taste. The price for the pants is good, but the shipping and handling charge is excessive and a bit slower than other companies."
3,super baggy,"These pants have a very wide elastic waist, but the pants are so wide that on a very thin girl, the effect is almost comical. I should add that my daughter is just shy of 10 years old, average height and on the thin side, and the size 1 fits her well lengthwise, but, as mentioned, the pants are really baggy. So, these might be great for a brawnier child.The weight of the fabric is as expected, not light, but not a super heavyweight pant either. Quality seems good. No apparent shrinkage, but I do not put them in a dryer."
4,needs more memory1,very easy to use - but you need to purchase extra memory- otherwise 8 pictures is the MAX on the best setting. The maximum is 256 on the CF card (memory)that the camera can use. Works great now!
5,This is Great!,"This is possibly one of the best digital cameras that I've used (and I've used quite a few). My cousin lent his to me when I went on a choir trip through Europe, and the quality of the pictures is remarkable. Also, this camera's sleek design made it comfortable to hold, and the viewing screen on the back was an added plus. I didn't bring the instruction manual with me on the trip, so I had to figure out how to use the camera myself - which took me about two minutes. Deleting photos was a cinch and the playback mode was excellent."
4,Excellent DCamera...but,"batteries die to fast (specially when connecting it to a PC) and AC Adaptor is to expensive...Do all DCamaras have this issue?On the other hand, software is user friendly with links to online web sharing, plus camara usage is very simple without the bulkiness (compare the price to other DCamaras and this is an great choice for the avarage family picture taker)"
3,Big thank to other reviewers.... ;-),"At first I planned to buy this book and Keene's book on the first match. Somehow I could not get myself to buy them. Then after reading all the reviews for this book, I agreed with most of the comments.1) For a book of six annotated games, the full retail price is too high.2) Some reviewers said the book is too shallow. When I read this book the fourth time at a library, I liked and enjoyed it. Lots of explaination. Now after reading the reviews here I agree that Pando's analyses are one-dimensional and not deep enough, like Nunn's or Yermo's. (Thank you, other reviewers, for pointing out that my chess experience is shallow as well; and help me to save $$$. Lots of chess to learn for me.)This book is good as a teaching tool for 1400's, the price is not reasonable. Used book's price is a better investment. $9.99 is a reasonable price for a new one. Used ones, get the best price as you can here..."
5,cat's favorites,"i found these years ago when i brought a sample back from China & everyone's cats loved them. i finally found them for sale again so i'm really happy...so are my cats. they like the different textures of the toy, it makes some noise that they react to, it's light enough for them to throw and carry around."
1,Dissapointment,"This book was nothing like I expected. I wanted to know what a Kidney dialysis patient shoulld and should not eat and what foods are good for dialysis patients and what foods are harmfu. This book ""Creative Cooking For Renal Diets"" was strictly a routine Cook Book and not a very good one at that! Quite frankly, I would like to return it in exchage for a book that informs Kidney dialysis patients about which foods are medically good to eat and why and which foods to medically avoid and why? I do not need to know how to cook as I have been a gourmet chef for 50 years , but have been struck with kidney failure!PLease help me find the right book: Thank you,Kind regards,Albert Serianni"
1,Low noise factor but paper feeder ....,"We loved this printer for about a day and a half. There is very little noise (that is) when it feels up to printing. However; when printer was out of paper and we refilled it, the feeder didn't operate properly. This didn't just happen once, it happened about 3 or 4 times. Even though there was paper in the paper holder and it was loaded properly, a pop up message box kept insisting that the printer was out of paper and refused to print any documents. I have only owned this product a few weeks and already it needs to be serviced."
2,workbook - NOT TEXTBOOK - bad description,"I should have read the March 05 review. I looked up the textbook by ISBN number 0130631361 and ordered what I thought was the paperback version, but recieved a 3/8"" book of practice problems. So, I paid nine bucks for ISBN 0130377007 used that lists for twelve. Do I invest more bucks and half an hour for a five dollar refund? Or, pass it along to his teacher."
1,NOT HAPPY,I received this and the bottle was broken. The box was wet from the cologne spilling all over it and I am not able to return or even contact anyone!!!!! Very upset right now!!!!
4,Truely a Classic,"The Moodies truly are classic artists. The documentary feature of this DVD package is the best I've seen (or even read in books) on the individuals and the band. There is a lot of Michael Pinder as there should be, but less of Ray Thomas than I had hoped. The extra CD is OK keeping in mind that the recordings are quite dated. Some of the quality seems to reflect their mastering from aged acetates or maybe even old records."
3,fairly decent,Being a huge follower I bought this DVD set.I would say it is ok but the material could have been presented in just one DVD.Thought there was too much emphasis on the original band and would have liked more music of the band included.The 2nd DVD has a lot of repetion from the first one.Did not watch the 3rd DVD as I am not at all interested in the original group led by Denny Laine.Overall OK but if you can rent it rather than buy it that would be preferable.I think the previous reviewers have overrated this product.
2,Limited image quality,"I have ordered this CD for the images of the Psalter miniatures. I have found the resolution and the image quality not so good. Both are a bit inferior to the images of these miniatures freely available on Internet. The reproduction quality of this edition is not in line with its price. I have not reviewed the textual part, but it is in the essense the well-known book of the Bible."
2,Graphic violence depicted in this book,"As always, Lionni does a marvelous job of storytelling and captivates the reader with his wonderful art in this book. However, I want to warn other parents that this book contains an image that may be disturbing to very young readers. I checked this book out at my local library for my 4 year old to read, and thankfully, I saw the picture before letting him look at the book. There is a two-page spread where the mice are declaring 'War! War on the birds!' after Nicolas has told them what has happened to him. The picture shows all of the mice descending on the birds with sharp objects and one bird is being bludgeoned by a very angry mouse. It shows him on top of the bird stabbing it, with blood spilling out. I don't know how I would have explained this act of violence to my innocent 4 year old, so I'm just glad I previewed the book before he saw it. You will definitely want to read this book yourself before giving it to your child."
4,am pleased,"This is my first digital camera, got tired of missed photos only discovered when developed on my 35mm....I am so impressed with the HP612.. the set up is easy, using the camera for a novice like me made me look good. I did buy all the accessories: recharge batteries with adapter, adapter for downloading, case, so I'm set to go. Have printed my downloads on regular paper, still experimenting, and they came great. The only con, and that's why I gave the camera 4 stars, is that the HP program allows all manipulation except ""reducing red eye"". I have to go to another picture program on my computer to use this feature. All and all I am pleased with my 612."
1,Way too large!,"This belly band is huge. I'm a 5'2"", 125lbs woman and this band covers from the top of my bra to the middle of my butt. It's basically a tube top. And I bought the smallest size but it is still falling down around my middle. Maybe if I cut it in half and wait several more months, I'll be able to use it then."
2,"Runs big, cheaper, higher quality products available","I bought this belly band as well as one from Target to compare. This item was much too big, in fact it was so loose that I can't yet wear it at 20 weeks and have it provide support or help disguise my unbuttoned pants. It fits around the waist but is loose and falls down around the top. If I fold it over as stated in wearing options, there is a large noticeable line visible under shirts. Fabric is soft and comfortable but a little thick as well.As compared to a cheaper product available as Target, the fabric is softer and thinner, more comfortable I felt. Also the Target band fit as stated. This belly band also has seems along the sides, which I find a little irritating while the other I bought is seamless.Overall for the price and fit, I would recommend looking elsewhere, but it may just be my body type. I'm tall and thin pre pregnancy. The quality of the product seems durable and well made though."
3,A little large,I purchased what I thought was my size based on other reviews but I it was a bit too large for me at this stage in my pregnancy. It has been a great help to keep my maternity pants where they belong and it has helped me wear some of my non-maternity clothes a bit longer.
3,Cozy but not really supportive.,"I found this product to be comfortable and to bridge the gap between my rising shirt and falling pants. I wear scrubs a lot for work and it did greatly improve the look and keep my rear from showing every time I bent over. I would not say that it kept my pants up or offered any real support, though."
2,"Great at first, but didn't last","This is a good product and does what it's supposed to. It would have significantly extended the life of my jeans into pregnancy, except that it got a hole in it the second time I wore it. The fit was good (not so tight as to tear), and I didn't catch it on anything that I know of. The hole wasn't at the seam either."
4,Belly band,"Good quality, very soft. I'm a size 6 and ordered size 2. I don't feel like it really holds the belly, I feel I should have ordered size 1. It is comfy but not super support, or I ordered it too big :("
3,Huge!,I like the idea of this but it doesn't work too well at keeping maternity pants up. It's simply not tight enough. I bought the smallest size too! I'm in my third trimester. I do still wear it though with my maternity jeans because atleast when the pants are sliding down the band makes the sliding look less obvious.
3,Not so good,"I hand washed it before wearing. And the water became dark. When waching carefully , I found there is a whole lot of little cotton shedding in the water. Then I washed twice, third time...Guess what! I rinsed it for about 15 times before the water became somewhat clear. I was so angry that I almost throw it right in theto rubbish can. I do not exaggerate at all. You might not know this if you machine wash it. But do remember do not washed it with light colored clothes. But after dry, it looks just fine. But it doesn't hold the pants that well. Just helps a little."
4,Ok Use...,"I bought the belly band when I was in my 7th month of pregnancy. Like it says, it's good for holding your pants up without zipping them. I work in a hospital, and it helps so that I don't have to tie my pants so tightly. The only thing about it is that it rolls up a lot and after wearing it several times, it starts to really stretch. I'm plus size and got the size four, but now wish I had of gotten the size 3. Overall, it's an ok buy!"
2,buy some long tanks or cami's and save your money.,I thought it would have more strength. It seems a bit weak and not near strong enough to help hold up jeans. It is also very long and I have to fold it over which then causes some lines. It is OK but glad I only bought one. You could just as easily get a few long maternity tanks or cami's at the Gap and actually have a summer shirt to wear if needed for less money.
2,Not very useful,"After reading all of the reviews, I was really excited about this band, but have not been able to use it. It wasn't tight enough to really hold up my pants without having to use a bunch of safety pins/ rubber bands, even at 20-24 weeks of pregnancy. I tried folding the band into halves and thirds but it still just bunched up and didn't feel comfortable. I am a size 4, so I bought the size one band which should have fit. I did take the seam in a bit and that helped some, but not much. I have just given up and switched to full blown maternity clothes. The company was very helpful, though, and I was able to return one of the bands that I had not used."
4,Comfortable,"The band is very comfortable and flexible and easy to use. It started to come up a little when I would sit down and then stand up, but nothing too annoying. I would just attribute that to the fact that my tummy isn't really big yet. Overall, great product and highly recommend!!"
2,Found a better belly band than this,"Not as stretchy as another product I bought - actually tried it on, didn't like the feel of it and have never worn in. I wear the other belly band every day. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,Here's an odd one,"I found the main character so peculiar, so emotionally inaccessible that it was impossible to be sympathetic to her. The plot is interesting, but the book just lacked something. Perhaps because the character is a psychiatrist explains her once-removed quality from everything and everyone. Through the brutal murder of her daughter, the search for the killer, and the revelation of her life's secrets, she (and we) learn that she and her daughter didn't know who the other really was. Just as she and her own mother didn't know each other. I guess this book is a mystery, but there was nothing thrilling or suspenseful about it. It's more about secrets and lies than about madness and murder."
4,Very cool book,"After reading this book, I will say that half of the chapters resonate with me and half of them don't. . .but I've found something beautiful and lovely in each chapter, as each author has a unique outlook on life. I've considered purchasing this book for a few friends, in fact."
3,Everything you need for the installation,You can hook up your Stilleto and have wires running all over your dash board or you can buy this kit and the vehicle kit and do a nice clean installation. But I wonder why there are two kits you have to buy. Why not include it all in a single kit?
4,Simple but fun,Prelude to Crash mind over mutant and could have 5 stars if each level wasn't so short and had more lives to gain during play.
3,"Alright game, but. doesn't feel like a Crash game.","Wow, what happened to this franchise? This game is allright, but in no way is it as good as any of it predacessors. A Crash game is just not a Crash game without the trademark spin, collecting Wompa fruit, knocking head/bouncing into wooden boxes to get said wompa fruit/free guy/Aku Aku powerup/etc. Why did the villians have to get annoying dialogue when in battle with Crash? What happened to Crash's trademark ""Woh!""? Speaking of dialogue, the current game has Crash going through puberty backwards, he seems more scronny, and has lost his touch. This just doesn't feel like a Crash game. Granted, Crash's usual formulla is a recycled version of Super Mario Bros., but it at least that worked. This just isn't a Crash game. This is the Super Mario Bros. 2/Super Mario Sunshine of the Crash series."
2,Superman Fan. . .but not a fan of this book,"For Tomorrow, Vol. 1 was fairly decent. . .I was looking forward to Vol. 2 very much. But then, when I finally picked it up and started reading it, I didn't get more than halfway through--essentially, right around the point where the reason for the disappearances is revealed. I idly flipped through the rest of the book, and it didn't get any better. A disappointingly BAD Superman story."
1,It's NOT tape!,"Aside from it not scaring birds away (they landed on it), it isn't tape, as it says. It's just this light weight, flimsy, cassette tape type of ribbon.Total scam."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"My husband is an avid gardener. Multiple vegetable gardens, about 20 fruit trees, blueberry & blackberry bushes ... and enough birds in the neighborhood to re-film Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". He's tried everything over the years to keep the birds from his fruit, berries, corn, etc. - all to no avail. So, when he spotted this tape on Amazon he decided to take a try. DO NOT FALL PREY TO THIS. IT DOES NOT WORK. The birds laughed at his attempt. We live in the northeast and have had one series of thunderstorms after another throughout the summer. A birds nest became dislodged from the eaves on the side of our home ... and what do you think the little buggers were using as part of their nesting material? You guessed it - the ""bird scare tape"". Yup, scares birds so much they use it to build their nests! I've actually looked out the window to see the bluejays resting on the tape. IF I could, I would pull down what's left of it and ship it back to Dalen and demand my money back!"
5,Scare tape,"Works great, I have some cherry trees the birds like to get fat on, this stopped them, I just cut some pieces of tape 2-3 feet long and hung it from branches on nearby trees using scotch tape. couldn't be easier, very pleased."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I'm not trying to scare birds out of my garden, I'm trying to keep hawks from stealing and eating my small chicks and chickens. Nothing on the actual packaging mentions any bird of prey. Only garden pests. Lets hope it works on keeping the seagulls off my parents dock this summer."
1,Did not work,This product worked for about 1 hour until the birds understood it was nothing dangerous. It is not worth buying.
4,Thanks for Taking the Visual Approach,"As a designer, it was nice to see someone finally taking a visual approach to the topic of branding. There are a lot of books out on the market that deal with the strategic end of branding with prose, but this was the first I found that dealt with the issue in a visual way."
5,The title says it all...,"I read this book every day and love it! Kevin Nelson gives practical, fun and whimsical advice to people who love (or want to love) to run."
3,it tells you everything But how to do it,I found this book very helpful. There are a lot of books out there about decorating and with the help of this book and Fabrique Technique I was able to put my three rooms in order before Christmas. Thank you Waverly and Ms Raffo!
5,"An excellent novel for those who hate ""literary fiction""","No trailer parks, no incest, no hyped-up drama, just beautiful writing and a moving, complex story that circles around a group of attractive characters - all of whom you slowly grow to know well, but will never discover all their secrets. I CAN'T STAND modern fiction - but this is something else. Try it - it's as good as JP Marquand."
3,Interesting,"The author has put together a nice story, wherein he exploresthe lives of some complex characters, all related to the elderly federal judge who has recently died in his hometown ofLouisville.His children are rather diverse in character, and they are stillexploring their feelings and goals even in middle age, and theycontinue to explore life in a very real way, even to the pointof disrupting their own families.There is a certain vagueness about some of the ""action"", wherewe aren't quite sure of the exact relationships among the various players, but the story is interesting and moves alongat a nice pace. It has the added attraction of moving in someunexpected directions.Slightly off-beat, but all the more interesting."
5,Great book...period.,"Very good book.If you are a student, a hobbyist, or an aspiring electrician, this is the book to start with."
4,Crash course,I gave this book to an intern we have working for us in our sales dept. He is representing a technical product and does not have a technical background. He says that it has helped. Its on his desk with lots of bookmarks hanging out of it so it looks as though he's using it. I personally haven't opened it.
3,Not much theory in this book,This book talks about the physical description of electronic components but doesn't get into circuit theory. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxx
3,page turner,"The lost cost self-promotion tips given in this book were extremely useful to me when I started my own business. This book, along with Guerilla PR Wired by Michael Levine, covered practically every aspect that I needed to know for successful self-promotion."
5,The Source of 'Northerness',"These are fantastic illustrations.C.S. Lewis stumbled upon these Arthur Rackham paintings for Richard Wagner's, ""Der Ring Des Nibelungen"". Lewis writes in ""Suprised By Joy"" how the pictures inspired a Mythical sensation of 'Northerness' in his young mind.As a child, 16-years ago, I discovered the same books and Arthur Rackham illustrations at the local library. I was enchanted! They led me explore the worlds of Wagnerian Opera.I'm really glad the pictures are now reproduced in this paperback book. Pure Magic!If you're new to Arthur Rackham's illustrations, these are PERFECT to start with.""Yo-Jo-To-Ho!!!"" -Die Walkurie"
4,SCHOOL,"I am required to use this book for school, i'm a beginner and it is perfect for anyone who is just learning to play. It easily explains how to finger, read, and play the notes. In the back is a fingering chart if you every forget a note. Although it is easy to use the quality is just ok it is paper so it rips, i have to put it in my binder and it is a little big so it tears on the rings. Overall its great!"
5,Solid basic information,"This book is really geared towards everyday people, men and women. It's not the macho SWAT team sort of stuff but just some good basic information to help you stay of of trouble and get away from trouble if you can't avoid it. If your a guy, read it but also share it with your wife or daughter."
1,did not receive the book / Amazon problem,Amazon had put in a wrong address that I have never heard of and the book went there. I never got the book and amazon was no help.
2,Jeep Knife,Nice knife that doesnt have to be sharpened. But it is too small for my hand and it opens actually too easy. With its small size I am afraid it will cut my hand since it is so easy to open
5,I don't usually read every book twice!,"I am a undergraduate student in Dept.of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Dept. in Bilkent University, Turkey. I read this book for my Electronics I course, and then for my Digital Electronics course for refreshment. It not only covers the material well, it is also a good-looking book, attracting you to read. There are very interesting, micro-scale pictures of chips in it, motivating you to learn the concepts."
2,Just finding equations,"What would really improve this text is if lessons towards the end of the text, chapters 6 and on, included the equations from previous chapters so the reader could get a general understanding of the material needed to the problems in the text.Also, it would be nice if the text included sample problems like the first 20-25 problems at the end of the chapters. Finally, I would like to see calculation of intrinsic amounts of carriers. Every time I do it I get something far from what the text uses in its problems."
4,"Not as long as advertised. Yet, not bad for the price.","The documentary is only 50 some odd minuets long. Nowhere near the 151 minuets like the back cover says. No footage from the movies are shown. The early interviews are the highlight of this DVD. Harrison Ford is actually having fun during his. When was the last time you've seen that? The press junket interviews from ""Episode 1"" are just fluff pieces. And, that's fine in my book. This is still a DVD about ""Star Wars"". If your looking for an in depth documentary about ""Star Wars"" you will need to buy the bonus disc from the Trilogy DVD set from a few years back. If you are looking for a cheap, fun, odd-ball doc, then you've come to the right place. Every ""Star Wars"" fan needs this in their collection. Everyone else should stay far, far away from this DVD."
2,this videos a joke,"This disc is a joke at best. On the back is a little notice that says ""this dvd is neither endorsed nor authorized by the 20th Century fox or lucas film lid. ""that means your not going to see any clips at all of starwars, not one clip. What you are going to see is some boring old interviews wiht some of the stars of starwars. thos being the Title stars of starwars.are the interviews interesting? BORING!Was the dvd worth watching or any good? Nope. should you buy this? if you wasted your money on a jar jar action figure then why not.This dvd is not well made and is just a rip off of your money. interviews are with Liam Neeson, Jake Lloyd, Natalie Portman, harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Samuel L jackson, Mark I will work for food Hamill, George Lucas,, Billy Dee Williams.HEY I WANT MY 83MINS BACK!"
4,for fans only,"a great DVD for all the fans, not a behind the scens movie, but a look at the hype. what the movie did to the world. The only misser (but a huge one) is that there are no scens from the original movies in it. Maybe it is time for mr. lucas to gif the fans what they want....an official DVD set, all the movies including a behind the scenes documentary."
4,cant go wrong,"I got several of these and well, it does what it is suppose to do. good price, fast shipping, cant be beat!!"
3,BEWARE No.18 Toasted Rose not color shown,"I have been using Clinique lipsticks for many years, with no problems until now. The no. 18 Toasted Rose is shown as a pink color and instead it is a brownish nude color, even tho the packaging name is 18 Toasted Rose. Unless you have time, etc., returning is costly and time-consuming (15% + 5.95$) with this company. Unfortunately I bought two."
2,no what I thought,"I got this for my 11 yr old as she wants to become more heathy and liked my yoga DVD. This is not for someone new to Yoga, the poses in it are poses that take alot of pratice, and it is not easy to follow for a kid, if kids are not already flexable they could get hurt tring some of this. I plan to let my daughter do Yoga with ravi singh and ana brett so she can benifit from Yoga instead of just tring to do pretzel poses right off."
5,just like i remembered,this yoyo is great for beginners the clutch works great and even comes with an extra string if your first one wears out.
2,DO NOT BUY!!,This yoyo is terrible. I have had it for several months and the longest I have ever gotten it to sleep is about 10 seconds. Its design is also very bad for doing tricks as it does not have a butterfly design. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it held me over until I could get a real yoyo.
3,Canadianly mediocre.,"This dude is basically the Canadian version of John Cassavetes. He's quite competent with what he does. The only problem with that is that there's a John Cassavetes already, just south of that border, who is MUCH BETTER than competent. I mean, this is no Shadows, but there's not much I can say is terrible about it. The acting is good, the cinematography is at times expressive and well laid out, at others boring and does nothing. The writing is realistic and sharp for the most part; while none of the jokes will really make you laugh, there are heartwarming moments. The characters have more depth and the overall storytelling is more intelligent than average-fare, but it's not intelligent or deep enough. While absolutely nothing about this film is bad, there's very little that's exceptional in any way, though."
2,Dissapointing,"I looked forward to a good X-box fighter for almost a month. I bought it the day it came out with huge expectations and was thouroughly dissapointed. The graphics are good and the off the wall attacks and limb damage is ingenuitive but thats about it. The fighting style's compared to Tekken 4 are weak and no where near as subtle between fighters, some are slow, some are fast but thats seems to be the only difference. And the Chi powers lose their appeal into the third round. On top of everything else the characters are boring and just plain [weak]. If you want a real deep fighting game with different fighting styles and interesting characters do not buy this game. If your looking for a way to talk &%&# with your buddies maybe but otherwise save your money."
5,Awesome game,"I really enjoy this game even now. I wish that John Tobias continues making this but whatever.Also, I love this game over Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance."
1,Don't Beleive The Hype!!,"First off the only plus I can find in this game is the Graphics. Although every character has their own moves + combos, they are very basic and easy to learn.There will be no strategy guide for this game. The games replay value even with friends over is very little. Worst of all the camera angle changes the game makes while fighting will cause you to throw a controller or two. I was highly dissapointed in this game becasue I looked forward to playing another good fighting game on Xbox besides Dead OR Alive 3. Not!!Still waiting!! Still playing DOA3."
2,could have been better....,"I loved MK, and wanted to love this, but sadly I was disappointed....sorry fans, but I must pass on Tao Feng.it's sad since SO MUCH work went into this title....hope the next one goes better...."
2,Pointless.,This is a pointless release. The VR Missions aren't even fun. There's not much to say about Substance other than that it's...pointless.
4,Best Sence American Game Ever!!! This Rocks,This is the best American game ever. it makes sence other than any other stupid American Game. the Japan people who made this game did the best. I rate This The best 1# Japan/American game ever. Other games are stupid and don't make sence like this one you know what's going on and follows the story. ALL METAL GEAR GAMES MAKE SENCE AND ITS LIKE IT REALLY DID HAPPEN. SOME AMERICAN GAMES DON'T MAKE SENCE THATS JUST STUPID THEY SHOPULD CHANGE IT. JAPAN GAMES RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Not what I was expecting,"I would have given this game 3 stars if not for the skateboarding part, that was pretty cool. I'm giving it 4 stars because the Snake Tales missions do not include voice narration/movie scenes as in Sons of Liberty. Overall I'd say it's better than the previous MGS2 because of the new features."
2,What Is This?,"The graphics aren't bad or anything. This is actually like a mod and not a new game. You'd rather be better off without this game.It has a few extras and minigames, improved graphics and fixed bugs. Overall, it's just the same game. Don't buy it unless you got some green to burn."
4,BSA 30mm red dot scope,"First of all, the sight is stylish on almost anything you put it on. But it should only be used for small calibers in my belief. I had it on a AR15 and it sighted in well but I think the mount is too cheap to handle lots of 223 rounds. Now its on my marlin 60. Works great and I'm eating up the center spot on the target. Mostly plastic/polymer whatever it is! But for the price you can't beat it. 4 1/2 star, just don't like the plastic it shows scuffs. :) Oh and I almost forgot the adjustment knobs didn't seem right at first but they work. (They were really tight and tough to rotate)"
5,"If you are a publisher, PICK UP THIS BOOK!!!!","The Gift is fantastic! While reading this book, my fourth grade students sometimes roll on the floor in fits of laughter and sometimes sit quietly with eyes glistening. It is beautifully written with an important message about family, love, and roots. Unfortunately, the original art in it is GROTESQUE, probably to blame for its being removed from print. I BEG A PUBLISHER TO GET IT BACK IN PRINT--without illustrations!! I KNOW it will be a big seller!"
3,Please Read This Book!,"Sunny Delaney, please read this book. You see a little knowledge of the rules of golf is important in reviewing a book about the rules. Point: You would never penalize your ""opponent"" two strokes for asking for advise (the club you hit), because the penalty in match play (the only time you have an ""opponent"") is loss of hole - not two stokes. In stroke play the penalty is two stokes, but you do not play with or against ""opponents"", but instead ""fellow competitors."" Too picky? Not to a golfer, even a weekend golfer."
3,complicated,"Although my 4 year old liked it at 1st, she lost intrest in it quickly. All of the eraseing in order to reuse the book, the lead complications, pairing the right book with the right cartridge. Just a bit much. I also lost interest in all of the erasing that is involved. It doesn't erase completely, and takes alot of effort. By the time I have erased and set it back up, she was off doing something else and no longer wanted to play with it. The next time around the book was quickly filled with her work and ready for my elbo grease one more time. It has, however held up on the durability level for her."
1,Deceptive packaging,"The box cover shows a three line writing for children to learn how to properly make letters. We assumed that was the primary element of the product. When we opened it for Xmas we found that it only did that for the letter ""A"". If was deceptive for Leapfrog to indicate that the primary purpose of the product was to teach children how to make letters. We did not find the rest of it of any particular use. It not only is deceptive, the entire product is poorly made. No wonder the competition is putting a big dent in Leapfrog sales."
3,Leap Pad Plus,The Leap Pad Plus has a lot of educational value but the one I purchased for my 4 year old daughter hasn't been very durable. I only let her play with it under my supervision and we have been very careful with it but after 6 months it doesn't work at all and we have had to ship it back to the company. I find it ironic that their warranty is only for 3 months. She has never had another toy that is this flimsy.
1,Very Unhappy,"We purchased the Leap Plus Writer for my son last X-Mas. Every once in a while, I look at it and wonder why we don't use it more. Last night, it became clear once again. Sometimes the cartridges are not recognized as a Leap Product. Sometimes the GO button doesn't work. Sometimes, it reads from a different page than you are working on. It is so aggravating to me and my son to try to play with this together. I am so disappointed that we wasted so much money on it, and also on 3 additional books. (...)!!"
1,Use Caution with DIGITALWRIST,Be careful with this organization.I received the watch without the advertised 2-year manufacturers warantee or users manual. Lots of correspondece but no results. They stated they would send the warantee three times. It has been over a month and I haven't recevied anything but hopeful emails.Be careful with this organization.I shipped the watch back. Will file a dispute with my credit card company if they do not refund my cost.
5,"NEW BAND!! 2009!: MINNEAR, GREEN, MORTIMORE!!","""THREE FRIENDS"" is the name of the band, and they've recently formed featuring three key members of Gentle Giant: Kerry Minnear, Gary Green, and Malcolm Mortimore. They haven't written any new stuff yet, but if you're a fan, I strongly suggest you write their website, to give them a bit of a push. If you like Kerry's theme music for this DVD's menu section, (as well as the last), then you'll realise just what an interesting prospect a debut CD might be! And, having heard ""Free Hand"", on their website, I can assure you that Kerry, Gary and Malcolm haven't slipped one bit, either! And... Who knows? Perhaps some of the other guys, (who never would have envisioned this happening), might just decide to come back into the fold, as well!Now, about this DVD... It's great, in fact better than the last, and I hope they can dig up enough stuff to do a third- or perhaps we'll see something from ""Three Friends"", one day!"
3,Good but to expensive for the size,"Given the cost, for some reason when I ordered the pot stand I expected it to be about a foot taller. That said, it was easy to assemble and does the job."
3,"A good, fast, entertaining read, but...","the storyline, particularly the motive, were lacking. A very exciting scenario was built throughout the first half of the book, and then we find the motivation for this dastardly plot is...to avoid the estate tax when they die? Implausible. It took the air out of an otherwise fine story. Still worth a read, but this was disappointing."
4,"A fun, quick read about a conspiracy on Wall Street.","This is a fun, fast-paced book about a hotshot investment banker who becomes a puppet in the dealings of a conspiracy of high-placed Harvard alumni known as the Seven. The depiction of Wall Street is pretty amusing, but not too badly off-target. I liked it in that it was never boring and quickly moved from scene to scene, although it did get a bit unreal in places."
4,Good for an Energy Boost,"As a college instructor my schedule changes every semester and I find myself having lunch at 2 in the afternoon or at 10:30 in the morning. I sometimes have to go 6 hours or more from one meal to the next. These protein bars patch me through. I get the energy I need while skipping the highs and lows of something with sugar. Also I am no longer hungry after I have one.I have been using one sugar free product or another most of my life. These taste as good as the best of them. However, if you're new to sugar free food products you may not agree. Sugar free products are an acquired taste"
1,Disgusting,These protein bars taste like cardboard and I'm thinking about throwing them out because they make me feel sick. Don't buy. Doctor's carb-rite bars are similar in stats and taste way better.
4,eye-opening!,"I really was quite impressed by this book, and really enjoyed some of the arguments made by the authors, it is quite eye-opening!"
1,Didn't work at all for my 50 lbs dog,"I followed the instructions and trained my dog to know the boundaries of the system. My dog would simply run though the boundaries, ignoring the shock. My dog is about 50 lbs and not too big but the shock did not bother her at all."
3,The containment for our dog,The product is wonderful but we have a yard that goes up and down and the product didn't cover all the spaces. We felt for our yard there were spots left open and the dog would be able to get out. I think in a level yard it would be ideal. MG
3,Wireless Pet Containment System,"I did alot of research before I purchased this product for my Jack Russell. We live out in the country on 3 acres and we were having a lot of issues with him traveling too far out in the woods or running out in the road. After receiving and reading the directions and trying it out, I was very pleased, but it was very traumatic to watch my Jack get shocked when he did not at first pay attention to the beeps and stop. He would cry and keep going and keep getting shocked and I would beg and plead for him to come back closer to me so the shocks would stop. After a few days of training with the flags and beeps, he finally got it. I do have to add that he hates the collar and when we get ready to go outside he gets really irritated when I get it out. Once we get outside however, he forgets about it. I guess each dog is different."
4,awesome Wireless Fense Sets up in minutes. Batteries though.,It just works and works wonderfully. The instructions are clear and concise and it only takes a few moments to setup and you can take it with you when you move. It does run thru batteries alot though. Best to stock up ahead of time. They seem to last about a month.
2,Too large for my dog,"The color was a bit too large for my dog, and the transmitter had dead spots in it. It didn't always beep or shock. We ended up not even using it cuz my dog still ran away. I'd actually like my money back. I think it might work with a larger dog and differently built house. Mine has too much cement and I think it block the signal. Plus I have a large family and there are always 6 cars in our drive way."
1,Sucked.,Battery died in less than 10 days. The whole set up seemed to be kinda flimsy. Not pleased at all.
2,Letting my Dog go past her boundiers,"At first it done good, but now only 2 months later its not working well. I replaced the battery and its still not shocking her like it should when she goes past her boundiers:( My husband placed it on his hand to test it and it will shock one time a very dull shock and its turned up to 6 and then it will stop. I don't know what else to do. I think it may be defected:( I had always heard good about them, but mine shouldn't be messing up after 2 months."
1,Poor customer service,"We have two dogs using the wireless containment system. One night, our electricity went off and the dogs went crazy. Their collars were beeping and shocking them. We had to catch them and take off the collars, then remove the batteries from the collars to make them stop going off. This happened a second time, so I called PetSafe. The customer service rep I spoke with was almost bored with my problem. I truly expected someone that would be concerned about pets and offer suggestions, but I was told to buy a battery pack. I asked if he knew of any packs that lasted over 10 hours because our electricity was off 12 hours the last time, and if we hadn't been home due to a funeral, we would have been gone for most of those 12 hours. He had no idea, just told me to check with Staples or Office Depot. I was VERY disappointed with the lack of concern on their part."
2,Not sure of the perimeter,"We have installed the system and put the transmitter in our garage. The perimeter seems to be fine in the back yard and front yard, but it almost seems like an oval so that there are areas in our neighbors yard that the dog can really get to, but not in ours at that same distance. Haven't figured out why though. It is hard to teach your dog the perimeter when it is in your neighbor's yard."
1,Do not buy item!,Purchased item and 1 week after warranty expired(6 weeks) item malfunctioned and shocked my puppy and would not stop shocking him. Do not buy!
2,Avoid if you live on a hill,"If your property is very sloped i would avoid this and just get in-ground fencing. Our house in on a hill and we loose most of the area our dog should be able to roam in. Also, we have been having issues with the barrier ""floating around"" on occasion. At these times our dog may be shocked as soon as he walks out the door."
3,PetSafe wireless fence & collar,"The thing works for the most part, but twice now the collars started shocking my dogs when I power off the system. I don't know if they have any competition b/c I've tried finding other brands but I haven't seen any others that don't require manually installing the boundary. Thus it's a necessity but far from perfect."
1,Inconsistent,"Like some others have noted, I found that the receiver collar would not trigger at a consistent distance from the transmitter. I tested it carefully, holding the collar at the correct height, but the trigger distance varied by as much as ten feet. I also found that the collar would occasionally trigger on the way back to the house. I gave up and returned it and installed the in-ground version. It was more work but it is very consistent."
1,Give it two years and then it breaks,"I bought the same unit about 3 years ago in which it worked fine for about 2 years and then around year two my neighbor came running to me after going out to get some groceries for about 45 minutes with my dog in hand. The system failed even after reseting the unit it would work for about 1 week and then reset, after awhile it stopped working altogether. If you feel like spending money for something to work for 2 years and thats it then this is the product for you."
2,boring!,I never knew something dealing with Elvis could be so boring. I never would have read it if it had not been assigned for a class.
1,2 seasons- so far- with 4 defective disks,"Hello,In the first season, the first disk and a second one were defective: disks had a curvy edge with the disk not being properly scored.In the second season, so far, 2 other disks could not be loaded and seen.I am a very unhappy camper as after the first 2 disks I discovered unuseable, I sent a review/ complaint- no answer!Thanks for letting me sound off! I don't think I will buy from this group again and will ask for a refund through my Discover cardcompany!Jan [12-21-10]"
2,ncis,"i like ncis but I will not buy anything from this seller. My dvd was to be new. they do not work in my blue ray, they where scratched and the case are all broke. I'm not a happy customer."
4,Makes My Dog Smell Fresh n Clean!,"This is a great spray that leaves our dog smelling fresh and clean. We use it every 2 or 3 days between baths when he starts to smell a little too much like dog. I recommend this product for sure and the baby powder scent especially. I tried other scents but they were just obnoxious or not pleasant but this one is soft and makes the dog smell fresh n clean, just like the name of the product."
4,Good Little Product,"I really like this product; it smells great and is actually bigger then I realized it would be. On my dogs the smell only lasts maybe two days, which leads to me spraying them more often. However, I don't need to use very much, so despite using it often I still have a bunch left.I have 5 dogs of various sizes, so yeah, my home can get bad smelling if I don't watch it - I will definitely buy more of this, it really helps get rid of the doggy smell in my house between baths. I even spray a little on their doggy beds to get rid of ordor."
5,"Fascinating, engaging, just plain awesome","I love this series. Instead of the classic era/age chronological approach to evolution, this series takes a structural approach to evolution to show how various different animals evolved similar traits in vastly different ways. I was at first very cautious about this series. History channel has a nasty habit of creating over-sensationalized unscholarly docs that are merely designed to grab a wide audience. The team that created this series however, did an excellent job of simply presenting the experts and their arguments in an engaging and complete way. Overall, this series far exceeded my expectations, and deserves much more attention, especially during a time where so many still cling to literal interpretations of the creation narratives of a certain desert culture."
1,There is no solid science left,"This product just leaps off presuppositions and presents them as fact. With 0 scientific method, and no intellectual honesty, this is one of the worst ""scientific"" productions in history. If you wish to brainwash your kids and teach them what to think instead of how to think buy this by all means."
5,Ding-How! This book is tremendous.,"Frosty Westering at his best. This book is down to earth and the stories and illustrations that he provides are top notch. This book has helped me become a better individual, and I owe it all to Frosty. I commend Frosty on a job well done."
4,Good gate for the bucks,"The Turbo Tailgate Net was easy to install and adjust to fit. The quick disconects makes it simple to remove when necessary.I installed it in a GMC Sierra 2500HD, which has tall bed sides. The width fits well, however, the height is about 3"" shorter than the factory tailgate. That's not a problem for me, but could bother some peoples aesthetics.Overall a very good tailgate for the bucks."
3,Basic Cookbook and Not Basic Cooking,"I mistakenly thought this book would teach me the basics of cooking, not really. Like every other cookbook I read through it without understanding the meaning of the technical cooking terms. Plus you gain little insight into the fundamentals of proper cooking technique.The problem with this book is that if you can use Amazon then you don't need a basic cookbook. The internet is full of free recipes, most much better than the ones in this book. The writing is translated from German so its a little weird. At times it sounds like it was translated by a teenage girl. ""Dont's at a barbeque, enemies attending!"" Bizarre.Anyway, I was pretty dissapointed with the content. But the photos and layout are very good."
2,Blatant Bigotry...not a good choice,"I usually enjoy Judith McNaught's romances for their satisfying storylines chock full of twists & turns and charming characters. However, I found Tender Triumph offensive and was very disappointed in the heroine's personality. She is extremely narrow-minded and bigoted. Ramon, the hero, is a highly intelligent,handsome, old-fashioned style gentleman who happens to be Puerto-Rican. Why Ramon would ever fall in love instantly with a woman who throughout the entire book - right up to the end - has an incredibly tactless & vocal distaste for all things Puerto Rican is beyond comprehension. The book is only worth reading to see what a wonderful character Ramon is."
4,Good Read,Judith McNaught has always been a great writer and I love to read her books. I am a true fan of her historicals and hope she can get back to them.
1,Ick!,"Judith McNaught is usually wonderful. I have read every book that she's written to date and enjoyed them all until this one. I still can't believe that JM wrote this! Go to a library and check it out if you're curious, but don't waste your money. There is no character development and this story is completely random, with no real flow or definite story line. Horrible. If you want to read a good book try any of her other books. I especially loved Paradise, Whitney, My Love, and Until You."
1,Amazed,"I was taken in by the numerous good reviews of this DVD, I watched the movie in disbelief, firstly discovering that it was only 10 minutes long, and secondly experiencing the plot which was something on a par with the intellectual creation of a 10 year old with limited imagination, spend your money on a movie that has at least something akin to a plot/storyline to offer."
1,Not Worthy of the Marvel Legends Title,"Unless you want to count Toad, who was originally designed for another line, this figure is the worst one in the Marvel Legends line. The sculpt is horrible and the articulation is worthless. It's about 5 years behind the level of quality this line has demonstrated with almost every other figure. Save your money and send Toybiz a message. Don't give us the crap when we know you're capable of so much better."
5,Finding Nemo LeadFrog LeapPad Book,Absolutely wonderful learning tool. Both my five year old and two year old sons spend hours pressing the buttons and doing all of the educational excerises. What a wonderful way to stimulate young minds!!! I highly recommend this book.
5,excellent game,"this is a great game for the gamers that are looking for a game with a deep story, great battles and long gameplay.I just loved it. 5 out of 5."
5,Worth it!,This book is informative and worth the money! I especially liked the rhymes at the end that can be used with the signs. My youngest son is 7months old and anytime I do some of the rhymes he laughs and smiles. My four year old has also gotten in on teaching his younger brother the signs. Even though my seven month old hasn't produced any signs yet (the book says he is too young) I can tell that he has started to recognize some of them. I look forward to communicating with him in the near future using the baby signs! I highly recommend this book!
3,A good read,This is a good read on how to learn to sign with your baby even though they can hear. They simply learn to communicate more quickly and then tend to drop the sign language as they learn to speak. The book explains how to start and to teach both yourself and your baby to sign.
2,Too much information,"This book has way too much information. A good portion of the book is spent telling the reader what a great idea signing with your baby is. We already know that, that's why we bought the book! Plus there's just too many signs. Most babies and parents for that matter just need some basics. A more basic book would be a better use of most parents' time."
1,Thought the new edition would be better quality.,I am very disappointed with this book. The photos resembled poor quality black and white shots taken many decades ago. The type and illustrations were also very low quality. Not much care was put into making this book. The concept seems very useful and I will look for other books out there on this subject. This one goes in the trash.
1,Utter nonsense...,"...Acredolo and Goodwyn took a single research study they did on a group of 106 California residents and turned it into a ""cottage industry"" of teaching ""baby signing""...STRONGLY suggest you read their original paper THOROUGHLY before investing money in any of their books or courses."
3,baby signs : how to talk with your baby,I thoougt this book was ok but not nearly what I was expecting with very few signs in the book most of the book is about other peoples experices and the dont tell you any signs until your don with book and way to many pictures for an adult book.
2,Just a brag book,"This book spent most of it't time telling about how wonderful ""baby sign"" is and does not give enough directions for words. The authors spent too much time telling stories of how well it works and selling you on the ideas, but did not ""show"" a lot of signs that worked. They also missed several basic signs, such as ""wet"", and ""tummy-ache."" I would have enjoyed it more if there were more samples of actual signs."
1,Not as good as Garcia,This book is heavy on inspiration and light on details. I agree with the reviewer who preferred Garcia's _Sign with your Baby_ as being more complete and practical.
2,"Hardly any How-to, simply verbose","I found this book annoyingly verbose and lacking in the very substance that it proposes to offer. Mid way through the book I kept wondering when we would get past the simple-minded repetitive merits of signing and on with the ""How to"" suggested in the book title. I also question the idea of making up signs rather than standardizing on signs such that other children, parents and child care may understand as well. While my baby is eager to sign/communicate, she is easily fustrated when an adult doesn't understand her sign. I recommend teaching your baby to sign, but recommend an alternate source for guidance."
3,Too many examples,"I found the book informative and interesting, but it could have been cut down to half the length. There were too many ""stories from real life"", and I found it hard to distingish the stories that are true from the stories that were simply invented to prove a point made by the authors. It was almost as though the authors thought they needed these stories in order to convince the reader that sign language is a wonderful tool?In spite of being annoyed at the large amount of stories, I do believe that signing is a great tool and am definately going to start teaching my 5-month old soon. The book will be very helpful when I do start and by the way: the examples can quite easily be skipped when reading through the book."
2,Not as helpful as other books,"Contains some interesting facts on research and teaching kids signing. But this is also included in Joseph Garcia's Sign With Your Baby, and it includes more useful, practical information about introducing signing to your baby, as well as actual ASL signs, not made up ones, as in Acredolo's book. Amazon usual has great deal on video-book-flashcard kit. Loved that! Also more useful was buying an ASL pocket dictionary, once little one's vocabulary takes off, and can't find all words kid is interested in in these texts."
3,Nice book,"This book has very nice pictures. I bought it at the recommendation of one of the gardening blogs that I follow. I wouldn't say it is the best gardening book I've ever purchased but the price was VERY low and as ""picture book"" to leaf through when I'm having a cup of tea wishing for the winter to be over, it is a nice piece."
5,A real screamer!,"Very good delivery. After an attempted break-in, I purchased and attached these units to my doors. I also paid attention to earlier Amazon reviewers of this product and bought a roll of double-side tape instead of using the tape that came with the product. If you haven't made other arrangements to protect your windows and doors, consider these."
3,Cannot Complain,One of the 6 alarms that I ordered came with the package open and was missing the batteries - otherwise it was fine
3,dead batteries on 4 of 11 units,"I was disappointed in the battery situation. The instructions say to remove a tab attached to the batteries, but there is no tab. I measured the battery voltage on the bad ones. It was very low. Amazon's return was easy, print a label, use the same box and drop it in the mailbox. If your unit isn't very loud, ship it back to Amazon."
4,Fascinating piece of audio literature,It is an amazing production that shows the underside of the New Orleans French Quarter. This thrilling piece of audio theater draws the listening audience from moment one and the keeps the momentum up til the last CD.
3,tangle jr.,"this tangle jr. was a little disappointing because i wanted to find one like the original one i had as a kid. i suggest ordering from tangle's website, because there is more variety and you can find different colors."
3,nice car not good for hilly areas,"My husband and I bought this car for our daughter for christmas...she was 13 months old. We used it for the first time a few eeks ago when the snow finally melted and was warm enough to be outside without gloves. We thought it would be good because it goes with a push button and had a handle to steer. Well I was dissapointed...the car barely moves on the grass or going uphill, also when you let go of the button the car will coast downhill which is upsetting. I charged it exactly to the instructions and everything. I guess if you live on a flat area then it would be a great buy. However if you have hilly terrain i'd wait and get a more powerful one as this isn't much fun."
4,Nice,"It was an old angst ear movie... I love how it ends! It's pretty dated though, they talk really fast and some of he dialogue is difficult to understand..."
5,Terrific!!,"Without question the most interesting (just plain fun) of all the brief and/or electronic accounting books available. You ""play"" this serious academic CD similar to the way you play sophisticatred CD games like ""Sim City 3000"". And, the playing is so enjoyablle that you're unaware that in the process you've learned all of the basic fundamentals of financial accounting most anyone ever needs to know.!"
1,Mary Daly text review,"This is outdated and may have been thought-provoking in the 1960's, but feminism and domestic violence as disciplines have progressed far beyond Daly's rantings, however colorful."
2,Re-hash,"This figure is nothing more than a re-hash of the old Power of the Force Muftak figure. All they added were boots, a tunic, and a light sabre that he can't even hold. Sheer lazyness on Hasbro's part."
3,Disappointing,"I found this book too focused on breeding and less on the personality and living with a Havanese. Might be good for a breeder but as a ""dog lover"", I was disappointed"
3,size issue,"My main issue is the size of the ring and width of the band. It runs small, and since the band is thick it makes it difficult to bend my finger. I don't wear it often because it's rather uncomfortable. I would not have bought it, if I could have tried it on first."
2,Below Already Low Expectations....,"Being that it is only a twelve dollar ring, I wasn't expecting too much. However, the reviews and picture lead me to believe it would have a good color and cut to it. There's no sparkle to the stone in this ring at all. It just looks like a block of pink sitting on a thinner-than-pictured band. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone else....Perhaps they've changed their rings since the last review of 09."
4,Neat little device,"I got this for $50, here on Amazon and have found that it is a neat device. The palm version is older (4.1 I think some one said in another review). The stilis is very small and does not always work perfectly. It's large but an okay size for a man's wrist (although you will be a ""geek god"" if you show people what it does). Downloading a couple programs makes it run a lot faster and it would have been nice to have the time syncronize with windows. The battery life is about 14 hours if the PDA is not used but shorter depending how much the PDA is used. The watch face can be changed and different faces seem to allow different battery lifes but I don't think it matters that much.A mini on screen keyboard appears sometimes and is much better then jot but I'm not sure how to make it appear."
2,"I want a computer on my wrist. I really do! This isn't it, though.","I bought this for myself for Christmas 2005. (Had my wife give it to me.) Time enough has passed for me to critique it.I just don't use it.First, this CANNOT be your primary Palm device. The battery life is awful.Second, if you're over forty and experience any eyesight diminishment, forget this device. (I've had great eyesight all my life, but now I realize that my eyes are starting to fade because I cannot make things out on this device.) I was able to work OK with the tiny stylus.Third, it's really clunky. I own a Meritline USB drive watch, so I'm not troubled by having something a little uncomfortable on my wrist. I just cannot handle the weight and discomfort of wearing this watch.It's in the drawer. I really want computer on my wrist. This just isn't ready for primetime."
2,Feedback from using book in a course,"This book is below my expectations as a good introductory book. It doesn't have enough examples, and the examples are too straightforward in some cases. Too much attention is sometimes paid to development of the proofs, which can be left out if this book is as the title suggests : ""elementary"", because it's more useful to show the reader how to solve the problems. In terms of the organisation of the book, it's a bit confusing (this is especially obvious if you compare this book with Farlow). I think an excellent book can be produced if this book is merged with Farlow and with plenty examples thrown in. i'm not sure how this book was selected as a required text for my math course in Boundary Value Problems because i'd hope that there are better books out there in this 21st century."
1,A book plagued by misconceptions and typos,"While this book is an easy read and provides many examples, many problems are simplified under incorrect assumptions. There are typos and misleading(if not false)statements throughout the book. The lack of rigor is unsightly."
1,Really disappointing...rabid fan totally turned off.,"I was an addict to my previous ones for about 30 yrs. This one is a dink. My standard 2cup cups will barely fit in it now. Then you can't fully press the dispense bar down. So it takes minutes to disperse the liquid, instead of seconds. Often it leaves 1/2 inch of water behind, which means the thermostat won't reset and you can't start another 2cups of cold water to heat for up to 30 minutes. Yikes, that is scary slow. Seriously, I could do better on an open flame. After 5 weeks of swearing at it, it is a goner, and I pulled out the old electric teapot. I had contacted the company to return it and they blew me off. Yuck."
1,Faulty power switch,"I used to have one of these and really loved it, but after a few years the dispensing lever broke. I was happy to find that the Proctor Silex Hot Shot was still available, so quickly ordered a replacement. It came promptly and was packaged well, but, sad to say, the unit didn't work properly. The ""power on"" switch was faulty. Trying to get it to heat at all was frustrating, and forget about re-warming a forgotten pot or heating a second one; that just didn't work at all.Reading the other reviews now, it seems that the manufacturing quailty on this item has really deterioriated, so I don't think I'll try re-ordering it. Too bad, as I'm not thrilled with the very few alternatives I can find."
3,SUNBEAM HOT SHOT,"I have owned a Hot shot in one version or another for about 20 yrs. I love this product and when my old one died I purchased a new one right away. I still use it daily but have found that the new one does not heat the water to the degree of hot the previous ones did. At times I find myself having to ""zap"" my tea in the micro to get it to the desired temp. This might just be my hot shot and not all of them so if you were thinking of getting one, I would still get it just know it might not get as hot as you would like it too."
4,Great Time Saver!,This is product is great! We no longer have to heat up the whole tea pot full of water for enough to make oatmeal or tea. It's quick and it doesn't take up much counter space.
3,Good buy for the price,I had a hot shot before and loved the convenience of heating water in seconds rather than minutes. The only issue I would have is that the heating button is in the back whereas my old one had the heating button in the front near the dispense button. It's a little more inconvenient and the heater takes a little more time to heat but it does the job.
2,Faulty Switch,"Like other reviews, the product worked well for about 4 months then the on/off switch broke. You press and press but it does not click. Now I have to press and hold and wait for my water to get heated. I just went back to using my microwave.Update: I tried Aroma AWK 11S as well. It took about 3min 23 seconds to heat 8oz of water where as Sunbeam actually did the job in less than 2 mins. If only the on/off switch was better designed."
4,Just one problem,"I bought this water dispenser to replace one that our family had been using for 15 years. We really like it heat water for tea/hot cereal etc. The only problem I have with this model is that the dispensing area is so short. We have to use a shorter mug to dispense the water into and then pour it into a larger mug. Other than that, it works as well as our older model."
3,Sunbeam hot shot,I have a hot shot that is white. I wanted to get one for work. This one is made cheaper than my white one. It isn't very sturdy. I do not like this style as well as the other one that they have.
3,not as good as the 3211,"I've owned hot shots for over 20 years, replacing them when it begins to take a bit longer for the water to heat. This new design is disappointing: the plastic is flimsier, which makes it feel like it could tip over more easily. It has a larger footprint, so takes up more counterspace, though capacity is the same. It took longer to heat water that my ten-year old 3120 model. The ON button is now at the rear of the unit, which initially seemed like a good plan so one doesn't get heating and dispensing confused (a messy mistake)--but that also means it's hard to reach, especially where I keep my hot shot, under cupboards. Sunbeam, you messed up a great little appliance."
4,Water boils fast!,"It's easy to keep clean and is easy to use. Its a minor quibble, but it would be nice to just press a button to have the water come out, instead of holding the button down instead."
4,does the job,"PROS -heats water within 30 seconds to 1 min SUPER FAST, SUPER HOTeasy to use/clean, really basic - one buttonhas dispenser for water so you can choose how much you want, it doesnt just give you how much you put inCONS -MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER HEAT - you have to put water in prior to plugging it in or else you risk damaging the heat corelike others posted - it only fits a regular size coffee cup under, not even a medium size oneonly fits 2 coffee cups worth of water, barely..all in all, worth $10-15 not a dime more.."
3,Not Impressed,"This item is nothing like the original Hot Shot appliance.First, it's cheaply made in China by Jarden (which owns the Sunbeam name). It feels like it won't last long. For instance, the dispense lever is made with flimsy plastic and feels like it will break at any moment.Second, the unit came out of the box with a gray, greasy film all over the exterior. No amount of washing & wiping with dish detergent and elbow grease have succeeded in removing the grime.Third, the reservoir contains no marks for water level. The original had marks for 8 and 16 ounces.It does heat water. For now."
4,Good Product,I purchased this to make hot water for tea while not tying up the mirowave. It is easy to use and quickly produces very hot water.
3,pretty good,The only thing I don't like is that some of my mugs are higher and they don't fit under the dispenser
1,Disappointed,"Friends of ours had bought a HotShot 3-4 years ago. We use it regularly when we visit them. It is worry-free....all you have to do is fill a mug w/water, pour it in, press heat, put the mug underneath the spigot and when the water is ready, just press a button and presto, you've got well-heated water.The Hotshot (same style as my friends') I purchased just recently is NOT the same quality as the one described above. So, I guess a few years makes a BIG difference in quality. The water tank leaks while heating unless you press down hard on the stopper inside. Apparently Sunbeam looked for ways to cut costs and a substandard product is the result. Sunbeam USED to be a company that you could trust for high quality appliances. Apparently not anymore.Suffice it to say, they lost a customer."
4,GREAT FOR WORK,"This is great for work. It's small, heats water super-fast and requires virtually no maintenance. Zero gripes, but if I had to be critical, it would be nice if it also had a warming plate feature. It would be nice too, if you could fit something larger than a coffee mug under it, but that would, of course, compromise the size. If you like hot tea in the morning or wish to heat nothing besides a mug of water,this is perfect."
3,great when it's not broken,I bought this for my mother in law who used her previous one for years. This new one worked less than two weeks and I had to ship it at my expense to a repair shop. It took over three weeks to get back.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I have purchased a sunbeam hot water dispenser from Walmart before and I couldn't stop raving about it. I bought 2 of these from here because I couldn't find them at Walmart anymore and I lost mine in a move. No matter how much water I place in the machine, it boils out the top and makes a huge mess on the counter and I have to re-heat more water because it spills my measured amount! Then the opening for the water to come out doesn't open all the way so it takes twice as long to dispense it. Luckily I have no patience or time to send stuff back or I would have sent both of these back the very next day!!"
1,What a nasty metal taste,"I recieved one of these I would have to say in 1987(original model). A few years ago it died and my family has had several since(a different model than the original and the newest). But this new model is terrible, my mom's the gray pour handle fell out of it and mine when it heats the water everything gets this awful metal taste. Come on Sunbeam this is really sad."
3,Hot Shot,"I ordered 2 of these and have only used 1 so far. It over heats, I still use it, but can only do 1 cup at a time or it boils over and runs down the unit and all over the counter top."
1,Junk--and possibly hazardous,"I had used an older one of these at work and was thinking that this would be good for my mother, who is in her 80s, to make herself a cup of tea. The first problem that I discovered when I read the instructions is that it must be unplugged after every use or can overheat. This is both a nuisance and hazardous for older adults (or anyone) who might forget to unplug it so I decided that it wouldn't be good for my mother after all. Then I took it home and thought I might use it myself. The first time I used it I filled it with less than the maximum amount of water stated in the instructions, but it started spewing hot water all over the counter anyway. Then it simply stopped working--I couldn't get it to heat water again. Needless to say I returned it."
1,Buyer Beware! The bad reviews are true!,"I bought this sleek black model to replace our old white Hot Shot that performed wonderfully for over 15 years. I read the reviews but decided to give it a try. I didn't really mind the slight leaking problem... we always emptied it after each use anyway. And the temperature was good for us, even for tea. But then after only two months we discovered it needed to cool a few minutes before it would allow us to heat a fresh fill of water. Then a few days later the heat button stopped working completely. It seems more trouble than it's worth to return it. I'm going back to the old model!"
1,Not what I anticipated.,"The ""button"" inside the water reservoir did not close. I had water everywhere. I know someone who has one of these for many years. Their reservoir button is made of METAL...this model is made of plastic. They should go back to metal. I ordered two of these and returned both. I bought one for me and one for a friend. Was very disappointed."
2,Not Great,This was just not as great as expected based on other reviews. Water gets way too hot to drink and a lot of steam comes out of the top. Also made of really cheap materials. Just not the quality I was expecting.
3,For the looks,"I bought this model because my old one after many, many years was taking longer to heat and I was afraid it would go any day. I chose this black model for the looks, as well as because it matched the coffeemaker, fridge and microwave. The ""ON"" button on this model was moved from next to the dispense button to the top near the lid. Which is good, as we used to hit the ON button accidently. What I don't like about it: after you get your hot water, a small amount stays in the dispenser and I have to pour it out by turning it over. We keep the lid open for hours."
2,Falling apart,"Mine is falling apart after a couple of years of light use. But I will probably buy another one, because I love the functionality. Its really fast and easy to use."
3,Not so Hot-Shot,This product does the job of heating water but it is shoddily made. The dispenser lever breaks off. I'm surprised that Sunbeam still has it on the market. As several reviewers note: The previous model was far better than this one.
5,Have bought 2 now,"I love this product. Heats up fast. This is the second one I bought, and the first one is still working. Would buy again and highly recommend it."
5,The One Item Everyone Should Have,"Sunbeam 6131 Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser, BlackThis is an item that is vital for college students, travelling vendors and young or old people who drink coffee, tea, hot chocolate or anything that needs hot water."
5,Sunbeam 6131 Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser,"This is the fastest way to make tea, hot chocolate, instant coffee or soup. I have a white one and when I redid my kitchen I replaced it with a new black one."
5,"Sunbeam 6131 Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser, Black",Price was reasonable. Received item promptly and shipped in excellent condition. This new item replaced an old hot shot which we had for about 20 years. Use it a few times a day.
4,Nifty,"I received this as a Christmas gift. So far so good. Boils water, and I checked i was bubbling when the light went off, quite fast. My only three qualms are that the cup clearance could be taller so larger cup could be placed under it, secondly I would like to be able more water. I like big cups/mugs of tea. For most people I think its fine tho. Great product. Also the cord is short. If you have electric outlets on you counter you wont have any problems, but if they are far away you might need an extension cord. Another bad thing is that it's so good and convenient that now I need to find a permanent place for it on my table. It's not that it has a large footprint, it's that I have a small table."
5,The greatest episode 3 set ever!,"This is one of my most favorite sets I've ever had. This set was great and took me only two hours to complete. After that, I started to play with it and I was so happy with the tank and the minifigures too.There was also many features on the tank and the lookout too. Overall, I enfoyed everything about this set I suggest you get this set, too."
5,Cool tank,The scout trooper is so cool like the light up light saberAnd that this Lego tank is so durable not like my emperorShip is a easy brake I tried so hard to do that to make it durableLike your tank
4,Fun toy!,"I'm 13 and I just want to say that this is a really fun toy! Also, I have been building legos all my life and this took me hours to build! My main gripe is (it's a silly gripe) it comes with so much stuff it is kind of hard to play with if you use everything at once-- don't let that stop you from buying it though it's really fun!I just want to clear something up in the features it comes with:1 clone, 1 aerial trooper (turns into a clone with removal of pack),1 mace windu with light-up saber, and one clone commander shown by the shoulder pad(Most likley Bly according to the armor color) 1 kashyyk trooper/ Barc trooper, 1 speeder bike, one cannon, and two battle droids. It DOES NOT INCLUDE Luke Skywalker and Dak Ralter, they are not even in the movie this comes from (Unless you count baby luke, but he still does not come with this set.)Thanks!"
5,An Absolute Necessity for anyone who loves to travel,"This incredible travel guide is like no other I've ever seen! With sites offering limitless possibilities on how to pick the perfect vacation spot and the best way (and price) to reach your destination, this book is a must have. I've been in the process of planning a trip of my own, and I honestly don't know how I would have ever survived without it!

Even if you have no travel plans in your near future, this book is a guarantee to have you packing you bags! Thanks and happy traveling!"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,THE TYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT YOU WILL GET IN CLASS WILL NEVER BE AS SIMPLE OR COMPLEX AS THE ONES IN THIS BOOK. YOUR BETTER OFF DOING THE QUESTIONS OUT OF THE TEXT BOOK FOR YOUR CLASS!
5,Its Pimpin' Pimpin',Absolutely LOOOOVE him. This and Pimp Chronicals are his funniest work Ive seen. My husband and I were in tears laughing so hard.
5,So Hysterical,"This is the funniest thing I've seen in such a LONG time! If you don't mind the constant cursing, you will enjoy it. Katt Williams is original & terrific."
3,a future cover of WW1 and 2,"I don't want to say I was disappointed, I thought that maybe, just maybe Wilf would catch a break, but in the end he loses. I am not sure I want the series to go on because he never catches a break. The series was interesting as it followed the end of WW1, the time in between and into WW2 with future weapons the bears as the russians,the empire as germany with there own SS in controllers,the imperials as the British Starfuries being spitfires, it goes on and on. I can't be the only one who could see it that way."
1,THIS IS A PIRATED VERSION!! BUY THE ORIGINAL!!!,"Buy the version with the editor John Branson, not Jake. The National Park Service did not get their official version copyrighted. Support the official version!"
2,Bug bombs !,"Everything worked as per instructions but I haven't seen any dead bugs yet, Either they all died where they fellor all made it out of my basement and then died ? Will set a few more cans off this week.I haven't seen any live bugs either."
4,Great!,Excellent value for all 4 movies! Buying them this way was a definate no brainer concidering if bought separate they are much more. Absolutly worth it.
4,Blade Collection,The movies were pretty good. I wanted to see all of them and this was a really good deal to get to see all of the Blade movies. It was a very good deal...Great value for all 4 movies.
2,poor communication,"All of my sons had the Cozy coupe so I ordered this one for my first daughter. I was so upset after a hard day of work my husband took time to put the coupe car together for our little girl. AFTER it was all together I came home and saw that it was not the one I ordered. which was very upsetting since I double checked by sending an e-mail and calling Amazon to assure that the car I would be getting was ""PINK"" not purple since I ""hate"" purple.... I was worried since they show a pink car yet the reviews mentioned purple and so to do the pictures of coustomers in it.... I guess My next step will be to call Amazon ""AGAIN"" and find out what happened and see if they can rectify the mistake with a little inconvenience to us as possible.... I have ordered a few other things from them which now has me worried....."
4,North Korea as you never seen before,Great episode on North Korea - very eye opening!! With what's going on today - it makes you feel a little uneasy on what's next for North Korea.
5,SMOOTH RESISTANCE,"I bought another VERY popular resistance band set. After using them for a few months I did not like the feel of the bands. They got very stiff as the resistance increased and felt jerky. Worse still they were hard on my joints. I then bought several LIFELINE USA cables with the three holder handles and these cables are much superior. The resistance is incredibly smooth and consistent, especially as the resistance increases. Unlike the other cables that seem to pull back at their max resistance, the LIFELINE CABLES could held at max resistance then slowly returned to the their starting position-giving me superior strength training results. Although the other system was a more complete package the LIFELINE USA cables are so superior all around that the other cables remain in the back of the closet."
5,"Best thing since, well....ever!!!","I bought this three years ago, no problem, nill. I LOVE IT!! It came with specific instructions on setup and detailed instructions for training. Those who don't love it, either didn't follow the directions or didn't follow through with the training, both of which take time and commitment. I even trained my friends' dogs on it with extra collars I keep around, so their dogs wouldn't dig in my flowers. I have had to replace the batteries in the collars only once in the three years. I got it because one of my dogs was a jumper...but no more. You'll love it, I promise."
5,Outstanding product,"I am very satisfied with this LCD TV. It easily matches the ratings and claims I studied before buying it. The functions, instructions and ease of setup are exemplary. The picture is very good.I purchased the TV through 6th Street Electronics and was pleased with their performance. They used DHL for shipping and DHL delivery was later than originally advised and handling was rougher than should be expected. The product was packaged well enough, however, to withstand the rough shipping treatment.I got an extended warantee from Sharp. I suggest this approach to anyone who wants such coverage, rather than using a third party approach."
2,It does not stay on.,This lipstick does not stay on any longer than any other brand. It also is rather greasy and tends to smear.
2,I chewed & swallowed it even though it made me want to gag.,"I bought this bk. since I saw it had 4 stars for the overall rating..... Well, I was not as impressed as the other readers.1st off the writing is choppy or something. To many small details. I don't know how many times I read ""Chewed & swallowed."" It was ridiculous! I didn't care for the main character (Paris) at all & was hoping the bad guy would run her over too. Mighta been better if there was at least some mystery.Anyway, there are far better suspense novels out there to read. If you really want to read it, I suggest going to a library."
3,Disappointing,"This book initially had promise but then eroded into an annoyingly cliched cop/serial killer novel. I was irritated by the cliches. The female protaganist isimprobably named Paris Murphy. She is, of course, beautiful and big busted, and unhappy in love.She is tough and likes killing things--does anyone in Minnesota do anything other than hunt? She is also stupid, visitng the suspect's home alone, unable to do a simple tire track comparison with her lover and nursing her equally attractive but stupid boss back to health.The killer himself is somehwat sympathetic and a bit of a weenie when it comes to killing. He starts with vehicles and graduates to knives. The author spends a great deal of time explaining him and unfortuantely, the reader never gets a real sense of the victims.The most frustrating aspect of this book is that there are sections that are quite readable. The author can write, however, the aggravating factors outweigh the intriguing ones."
2,ugh...,"I found the movie to be very slow and rather boring. Danielle is a student and on medication trying to find a theme for her thesis. She moves into a house and while there discovers a hidden room with articles about a hypnotist and a child murderer. She starts acting a little off and eating catfood, while her doting sister doesn't seem to notice anything. Long story short she gets possessed. Danielle's sister realizes something is amiss when Danielle tries to kill her. Luckily she escapes and drives to dig up a grave and fortunately runs into Danielle's professor who knows about everything going on and enlightens her into how to help cure Danielle and put an end to the murder's spirit. UGH....yep very quick end...and the ""twist"" at the end is rather lame and you can see it coming a mile away."
5,supernaturals,love this show the best on tv 5 stars i have seasons 1-3 only show i will buy cant wait for season4
3,Supernatural Season 4,"Exterior cover came in great shape, shipped new, but the case for the dvd's was broken at the bottom. DVD's were in perfect shape and are all playable, inside the cover you wont be able to tell the caseing is broken, but for a new item i expected it to be in perfect shape."
5,Great episode of a great show.....,"This is a Supernatural must see - Jensen Ackles at his comedic best, catching a ghost sickness that results in developing a fear of, well, everything.... with Jared Padalecki playing the straight man to perfection. Plus, the bonus at the end of the episode is not to be missed"
3,"Excellent, but the next season is better","Amazing season, but there are a lot of formulaic plots that harken back to S1/2s monster of the week format. Castiel and Chuck are pretty much the only things that save this season from being awful. The angel struggling to understand humanity and deal with his feelings for Dean and the ""Prophet"" wanting to help Sam and Dean but being unable to directly interfere and only watch and hope they make the right choices make this a very riveting season. Those guys are amazing actors. I think I am in love with Rob Benedict."
5,Amping it up even more,"IF possible, Supernatural becomes even better with the introduction of Angels themselves and even more horrid and dangerous demons.Each character continues to progress and we watch their season long internal struggles. I love this series, I hope it continues FOREVER."
5,wasn't there a singing group named sam and dean?,The saga of the Winchester boys continues. Fabulous series best appreciated if you start from season 1 for the back story and to understand the cast of characters (an episode with Dean returning to the past will fill in some of these details nicely)however Season 4 stands very well on its own with Dean returning from the depths of hell. Each episode moves the storyline along with plots that range from 4-10 on the creeped out scale. And of course the boys are fabulous!
1,Very Best of Herman's Hermits,Great album. Has all the best songs. It takes me back to my teenage years.
3,Light but fun,I thought this was a worthwhile purchase. Everyone in the family got a kick out of reading it.
4,Food for the soul,"Great Book- This book is what you will want to keep on hand or preserve in a treasure box to give to your son for guidance through his years of parenting. Simple, one-liners that touch the heart."
2,Too Simple,The book is cute. But I wouldn't buy it. I found it to be too simple. It's written in a language for the kid not an adult.
3,Long Live Farscape!,"Love the show, hated to see it end, but now I have the music it makes me feel a little better."
1,Tres Mexicanos Tontos,"I hated this movie. It sounds good, but then there are quasi-rapes, bad production values, racism, and idiocy. See Danzon instead, for a real charmer"
5,Great,Really fast del. Well packaged Just what I wanted. Not a really well know artist so I was pleased you had it in stock.
4,Very interesting and absolutely NOT gossipy,"Finally a book that focuses on what's important about the Fab Four (their music) without getting TOO techincal.Although, being myself a musician, I would have liked a Technical approach, as well, I can see that if a book is aimed to a wide target of readers it just can't be too specific on a subject alone.This book has the right balance between technical infos and interesting facts and anecdotes... Thumbs up!"
1,This product don't work,"It no fill any scratch, and 2 days after I used it the car get really dirty in all the zones. Not worth a penny in my opinion."
4,Deadly bargaining with a Nazi baron,"This is a dramatic and suspenseful story set in Austria during the Nazi occupation. Carly Siefermann falls in love with Nick Gallanz, a successful Jewish architect. His life is put into danger when the Nazis arrive. Wanting to help him escape, Carly reluctantly marries a Nazi bully, Baron Von Gottisberg in exchange for his help in getting Nick out of the country. Carly carries on with her pretend life with the husband she despises, but uses her baroness stature as a cover for her resistance activities, putting herself in danger of retaliation by her husband. The deception in her marriage, the furtiveness of her actions as she tries to help the allies, Nick's tense escape, and the evil intentions of the baron all contribute to the suspenseful fun of this story."
2,"Nice concept, poor quality and company service",I also loved this toy however after a few months of use the blocks stopped playing their tunes. When I called the company they refused to repair the unit even though I was willing to send it to them and pay for its' repair. Don't buy this toy. It's great for awhile but surely not worth your money.
1,Poor Construction,"You have to ""hit"" the elmo to get the noises to work, the decals keep peeling off and it is just overall a cheap toy.Very disappointed and would not purchase again"
3,too many ingredients,Most of the recipes had too many ingredients. Not for people who want to quickly throw a meal together. Also had a lot of specialty cheeses that I am unable to find at our local market.
4,Low carb,Great for low carb high fat diet. The recipes are yummy and easy to make. I would recommend this if you follow low carb.
5,Buy George!,"I love the recipes in Georges book. They are easy to follow. I am living on my husbands monthly disability check and was able to afford Georges book. It was a good price. I cant afford alot of expensive food,but when I do Georges recipes its not a problem! So Buy George. You cant lose anything but weight!"
2,Disappointed,The arrived quickly and in good condition. I don't find the books very useful. The ingredients are unrealistic and the recipes kind of like cardboard. I wish I had returned these books.
5,Best Low Carb Cookbook,"I've purchased numerous low carb cookbooks (I've lost count), and this one is the best. As a professional chef, George Stella really knows how to create a delicious-tasting recipe. There are numerous recipes in the book that don't involve much time, and I believe the recipes are healthful as well - not overloaded with heavy fats. I agree with the other comments about Stella's use of soy flour; on the other hand, if you just HAVE to have that pizza once in a while, you have a way to do it. This cookbook has been a great help to me in staying on a low carb regime."
5,absolutely everything about this book!!!,george stella's cookbooks are the best ones in my kitchen--and believe me i have a lot. i first saw him on food network and i was hooked. he is a great guy amazing personality and very funny--he makes cooking and eating healthy fun and exciting instead of drab and following a crazy schedule eat this then-- drink this at this time--it really makes eating healthy actually fun and attainable really is a LIFESTYLE-- can't say enough about this book and george stella
4,Interesting & Informative,The recipes are definitely worth the price of the book. The only problem I have is that there are ingredients that are not readily available in my area of the country. The story is also quite interesting.
1,German readers only,"I am very very disappointed with this book, not for its content, per se, but the fact that, while it purports to be in English, at least half of the text is in German. To start with, Casey offers no translation of the poems themselves, which, I guess, is forgivable, since one can purchase a number of translations separately (although, my favorite, by Stephen Mitchell, is out of print) but Casey also quotes Rilke's letters, and other poems and writings, plus numerous other writers, almost exclusively in German and offers no translation. The bulk of is commentary depends upon texts which only a German reader can understand. An immense disappointment."
5,good detailed number theory book motivated by record primes,Ribenboim wrote a book called the Little Book of Big Primes which came out in 1991 and was written for general audiences. This book and the revised edition of the Little book are of personal interest to me because my father's work in 1939 gets cited a lot with respect to the Carmichael numbers. This motivates me to read through the book in more detail that some of the other reviewers. But as Cube Boy mentioned this is not just about records. It is fundamentally an advanced book on number theory for mathematicians with many of the same topics as are in the Little Book but at a hogher level with more mathematical detail and with new results that came about between 1991 and 1996. I have also reviewed the second edition of the Little Book and I comment more about the prime records and my father's contributions there. Also the second edition in 2004 has new records as the computer is able to verify that larger and larger numbers are prime.
3,Hot Club California (unrated) - my opinion,"Although the cover shows a guy and a girl making out, you're not sure if the girl is actually nude. I guess you won't know for sure until you see the movie for yourself."
2,Plant this-- and watch it die.,"This book should come with a cautionary note: the author is a smug zone-8 gardener; unless you are in the Pacific Northwest, this book is useless as a gardening guide. Moreover, the author does not include USDA hardiness zones in the description, perhaps instead of the cutesy ""sounds like"" guide to pronouncing the latin name (""Epimedium"" sounds like ""stop the tedium"".) Perhaps it did not occur to her that people from other regions of the country would read this book. For those of us outside the Pacific Northwest, this book should have been called ""Plant this-- and watch it die."" The illustrations are lovely, but the author's affected folksiness (most egregious example so far: ""Yup"") make this an extremely annoying read."
3,"Interesting, well-written, not for everyone","Yes, the book is about death: troubled people, after-death awareness, suicide, unfinished business. Some of the stories I enjoyed. One or two I didn't get, or seemed pointless. Ochsner really CAN write, though. I would probably buy or read another book by her, after reading the reviews first to see if it's on a subject more to my liking."
4,I thought this was an excellent book!,"Julie moffett is a wonderfull author, and I really enjoyed reading this book. I especially like the way she intertwines Polish history with the story. I did notice something curious though, the plot of ""A Touch of Fire"" was extremely similar to Julie Garwood's ""Gentle Warrior"". I'm curious if anyone else noticed the similarities."
5,Great!,"The Bette Davis Collection, Vol. 3 (The Old Maid / All This, And Heaven Too / The Great Lie / In This Our Life / Watch on the Rhine / Deception)This set is terrrific. These are Bette Davis classics and and the quality of the DVDs are super."
2,keeps breaking,My son loves this mobile - however - i am about to return my second one - the first time the string used to attach the soccer ball was defective and now on the second one the wind up for the music just decided to break (after about one month). and what's the point with no music? I won't exchange for another - I think I will choose something else this time.
3,It's okay,"The mobile was not at all difficult to put together, as I read from one customer. I put it together in less than 10 minutes, and I had no problems with anything breaking. I just can't rate its use any higher because my son isn't born yet, so I haven't used it besides the one test wind I did to hear the song. It fit on the crib just fine and it is adjustable."
5,"A Very Cool Set, Great for Kids and Adult fans alike","This is a cool toy. It can rotate its gun and walk. The clone is a bit hard to fit in the walker. Lego made a tiny mistake. It's AT-RT not Clone Scout Walker. And I'll tell you this is no AT-ST. The gun fits on the side of the AT-RT. The Clone has red markings on it showing that it is part of Commander Neyo's legion. The price-per-piece is a bit off, 9 cents per piece and an extra 36 cents added at the end. But there is one problem for kids who have babies in the house. Its got small pieces, but hey it's Lego. Overall: BUY IT!!!"
1,RIP OFF!,"My son saved all his money to afford this toy...when it arrived I thought surely a mistake...nope, should have read these reviews. Way overpriced....it is the size of the $10 lego sets!"
5,scout walker review,This toy is really good. I really enjoyed playing with it. Any star wars fan should get this.
4,Great shine with minimal spinoff,"I am always on the lookout for the best tire shine, so I decided to give this a try. I've used other Black Magic products in the past and they usually perform adequately. However, this stuff works great. I really prefer tire shines with the gel consistency much more than the watery sprays. After spreading it on with the included applicator, the tires have a fantastic shine. It says you can apply again for an even richer shine, but after just one application it really gave a showroom quality shine. I can't say how well it holds up after rain, but the tires still have a great shine after about two weeks without any rain. The only negative is that there is some slight spinoff when driving. I applied this and then tried not to drive the car for a few hours to let it soak in. Overall, this is a great product and I'll definitely buy again."
3,Be Careful When Selecting the Size You Need !!!,"As with most things these days, this pair of gloves was made in China. The physical construction of the gloves shows that they're well made, and with good materials. The only problem for me is that the pair I received are at least one size smaller than what I expected. I ordered XL and I got XL according to the packaging, but my hands barely fit into the gloves and the reinforcement band across the knuckles is uncomfortably constricting. Had I known this when ordering, I'd have ordered a pair of XXL, if they're available. My recommendation is to order at least one size larger than you normally would. Hope this helps, Dennis"
4,Great gloves,I have to pull a lot of wire and work in culverts. These gloves are great. well worth the cost. They protect my hands from cuts and scrapes and also gives me a firm grip when pulling wire.
5,Safe and smells great,I love the way this smells. I am very sensitive to the strong odors in most cleaning products. The fragrance is not overwhelming and is safe because it doesn't contain the harsh/toxic chemicals that most cleaning products do.
2,disappointed,Information was not detailed enough. Very general in detail and did not show pictures to explain. Too much money for too little.
1,I found it to be worthless,I bought this book hoping to use it in an 8th grade art class and found it to be worthless. The way it is laid out you cannot even tell where the directions for a lesson begin or end. I am surprised this book is marketed to teachers. Have you ever purchased something that had to be put together and when you looked at the directions they just didn't make sense? That is how I felt when I opened this book. Since the beginning of this school year I have used many resources with great ideas that were online or in other books. I have not used this book even once. Don't buy it.
1,Disappointed!!,"I happened on this book at the library. I enjoy good fantasy, thought I'd try it. Noted in the dust jacket the claim of ""a work that will be favorably compared with the best of J.R.R. Tolkien ... from perhaps the greatest living writer in (or outside) the fantasy genre.""Well, this book stands about ankle-high to Tolkien, if that. The character's voice is inconsistent - one minute he's comparing action to videogames, the next he's highly poetic. He wants to be a knight who values honor above all, but over and over he brutalizes other characters unnecessarily - which for some reason makes them all become his loyal followers. On a par with Tolkien?? If it only claimed to be decent fantasy, I'd be less irate. Personally, I'd skip it entirely, if I were you."
2,Didn't like it,I really disliked this book. I thought the story was very disjointed. There were gaps in the story line and chronology. I am a fan of scifi/fantasy novels but not this one. I purchased this and the sequel based on Amazon recommendations. I will not be reading the sequel. Check this out from the library before you spend your money.
2,Potential but too plodding,"I found sections of this story riveting, but everytime I thought momentum was building it would return to a plodding pace.Great idea. Good characters and creatures. But way too many plodding sections for my tastes. Reminds me of the Soldier in the Mists/Arete books. If you enjoyed that style you will probably enjoy this one.For me, not as tightly written as the New Sun/Long Sun/Short Sun books. Those always had me on the edge of my seat."
2,Wolfe's work continues to go downhill,"Gene Wolfe has written some of the most brilliant works in the sci-fi/fantasy genres, but it seems like his glory days are behind him. In The Knight, Wolfe continues to indulge his passion for long and didactic dialogues, but since much of the time the dialogue doesn't advance the plot or give insight into character it just feels like a waste of time. The main character does not act in consistent or understandable ways, and when I did understand him, I found him unlikable.I was disappointed with Wolfe's Long Sun/Short Sun books because I felt they didn't live up to their potential. But they seem like masterpieces compared to this."
4,a solid beginning to a new epic,"As a fan of Wolfe, I got what I was expecting in The Wizard Knight, only not quite as much as I'd hoped. I was totally sucked into the realm of Able and his fish-out-of-water experience, and I thought his voice rang true, especially as it developed over time. Some of the creatures he encounters reminded me strongly of beings from other novelists (Pulman, Tolkien, Vance), but his use of the perspective of the first person narrative makes them unique to this world. The book did not end where (or when) I expected, but I know that it's the first in a series, so I can forgive it for that. I haven't read the next one yet, but have high expectations for it."
2,Disappointing & Dissipated,"The Knight begins well enough, but after a few chapters it becomes clear that no further levels of detail are forthcoming. It's very simplistic. Worse, it seems that with every other chapter our hero is deflected from his course. He aims at a several different goals through the course of the book but never seems to reach any of them, and this doesn't seem to bother him. He just plods onward. Finally, events have a way of always turning out well for our hero. It's way too convenient and simply unreal; too ""godlike"" to build any suspense."
2,"Good, but a little too much like work","I did like this book...well...sort of. The story is intriguing, the setting is interesting, the characters engaging, the writing HORRIFIC.I've read other of Wolfe's books and have encountered the same style. The story s fantastic if he would just tell the tale. His narrative wanders, doubles back, jumps forward, and sometimes just ""plays dead."" I don't get much time to read due to work, family, etc so I value the time I do have to read as an escape from the real world. This book unfortunately is WAY too much like reading a long, complex science journal to be a real pleasurable experience.Still.....I would place it on a ""worth a look"" list."
3,Dreamy...,"but annoying. I've read all of Wolfe's books, and this one is not his best. In fact, it is seriously flawed, as others have pointed out. This novel just doesn't hang together - some background is given short shrift, there are odd gaps, there are occasional jarring references to modern America, the hero is, and then is not, a super-hero, and a number of the characters have the same ponderous style of speech where they declare what they're going to say and then try to say it. An explanation may be that it's all a dream, but that's no comfort to the reader.That said, I'm giving it 3 stars, rather than 2 or 1, because, annoyed or not, I wanted to read to the end."
2,Kindle edition only,"I am enjoying this book. I'm about half way through it. I have read and understand the frustrations and disappointments of some other reviewers regarding the 13 year old boy as the narrator.However, the frustrating thing to me is the extremely poor quality of the Kindle edition. There are misspelled words (sometimes forming other words), misused or dropped prepositions, and missing punctuation. This is my first Gene Wolfe book, but it seems that these errors make one of his boks harder to read than others because of some of the stylistic points that you will read about in other reviews. I had been waiting for some of his Sun series books to be converted to Kindle. Now I will have to investigate further before deciding to buy them."
2,Doesn't last long,"Bought one of these just a little over 2 years ago, and the thing is now dead.Had trouble with it when I first got it. The batteries were woefully underpowered. Had to buy a pair of 2000mAh nickel-hydride batteries to get decent light and life out of the thing at night. The batteries that were in it were ancient (cheap) 900mAh ni-cads.It worked well for one summer, and degraded slowly this summer. I bring the thing inside and open the battery compartment thinking batteries needed replacing. Nope. The whole thing was rusted on the inside and water trickled out. Its not like I had it under water. It stood in mulch at the edge of an island in my yard.I've sent email complaining to Intermatic/Malibu about their poor weatherproofing.**UPDATE** A replacement unit is being sent. We'll see how this one goes."
3,"Great premise, poorly constructed.","I bought this book for my 18 month old and for my three year old. It's a little on the smallish side and is not very durable for a touch and feel book. As a matter of fact, it lasted approximately 17 hours in our home before it was destroyed. It has a great premise, the kids got to pull out drawers, answer the telephone, take a letter from a purse and then mail it (a favorite), but it just wasn't built to last."
4,Good book; Goes beyond listing techniques,"This book is another in the line of self-help, self-motivationalbooks. This one deals with time management, and unlike mostbooks of this type, Griessman goes beyond just a recitationof the all the time techniques you have read about in other places.He offers these, but he also adds personal insights frommany well known and successful people. Overall this isa good, if not inspiring, book on time strategies"
5,Good movie with lots of emotions,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had a good subject line and the actors did a great job. It had a lot of mixzed emotions andwhen you can get angry and then happy, that's a good movie."
5,"For all who asked, ""What Happens Next!?""","I had first found M. the Magician several years ago in a used bookstore. I thoroughly enjoyed that book...except that the ending left the reader screaming for a resolution between Mairleon and Kim. Magician's Ward more than fulfills our every question, as well as giving the audience another exciting mystery/adventure through an England that should have been. One or two of my friends have complained that Ms. Wrede did not take the implicit titular pun far enough, but, personally, I'm simply elated that she wrote a sequel at all. A definite read."
5,The best book!,"Every one of Patricia Wrede's books I have read has been absolutely wonderful. Magician's Ward was fast paced and had one of those thick swallow-you-up plots that made it nearly impossible to stop reading. Patricia Wrede has a wonderful sense of humor that only made the book better. It's one of those rare sequels where the second book surpasses the first. It's well worth reading, in other words READ IT!"
5,Great Book!,"Look people, this is an AWSOME BOOK!!! The characters WERE WELL-DELOPED, and I liked the way Kim tried to become a lady. The 1st one was better in my opinion, but this book was still awsome!"
3,Small town America,"This is an excellent true story about a community shooting, that took place in April of 1972, in Harrisonville, Missouri. It was Joe Ezterhous' first book and was written after he personally interviewed many of the towns residents. It's certainly worth a read to get an idea of the conflicting hopes and dreams in small town America, in the early seventies."
4,Blissful sounds,"Yume Bitsu creates some wonderfully delicate sounds on this album. The longer songs are expansive without being empty and devoid of structure and the shorter songs quite a surprising punch. The creaking opening of ""The Wedding Procession"" develops slowly and quite beautifully, something of a highlight for the album. ""Sharp, Twisted"" has an organic shoegazer quality to it that is a nice balance to the longer songs. The band uses repetitive waves of sound to mask some of the more delicate work, something that becomes obvious after repeated listens. If you like Windy & Carl, Fuxa or Japancakes, then odds are you'll find something on this disc to enjoy."
5,"""Masterpiece"" box set, Dolly at her finest!!!","This box set is truly a Masterpiece! It includes dollys triolgy of bluegrass/mountain folk records ""The grass is blue"",""Little sparrow"" and ""Halos and horns"" plus a bonus dvd/cd disc! between the three cds here dolly won two grammys and was nominated for several more! You will not be disappointed at all with this buget priced boxedset! Dolly is right at home with this bluegrass music! her vocals are cystal clear and brillant! dont pass up a chance to get these cds!!!!"
1,Dire,"I consider Von Freeman possibly the most compelling instrumentalist I have experienced: you'd think I was sadly ignorant if you only knew his work on this CD. The music is quite awful - there is just no chemistry happenning and his young sax partner I think was just substandard.For absolutely prime Von Freeman complete with his radical elastic pitch shifting and terrific timbral texturings you won't find much better than the CDs ""Fire"" and ""The Improvisor"" respectively: for the love of sweet Shinto get them before they go out of print!"
1,Save your money!,"Von Freeman is a local legend! Steeped in the tradition of Chi-town tenors. However, Frank needs to learn how to play changes. There is nothing artistic here. For those of you who can hear the bull in each phrase, stay away. This album is flash and fluff. Terrible."
1,Bad Quality,"It's not what i expected. I played this product for about a month and i realized the sound is just so digital, I mean, Nobody wants to play in a band with digital sound. It doesn't work for playing punk, heavy metal, death metal, it is just for invent new sounds, like new metal or something like that.Also the buttons are light plastic, it brokes with my fingers and no pressure at all. The Ac adapter works very fine, but the connector failed in a month.I take care of my products very well, so It's a bad quality product."
3,Too hard,"Pillows were too hard. Felt like laying my head on cement. Caused my neck and husband's neck to ache. Returned, which was costly,since I had to pay return shipping; also there is a restocking fee, so I lost money. Be sure before you buy."
3,Good product but box was battered....,"I purchased from a marketplace seller as a gift for my friend. I'm sorry to say that the box was battered and looked bad so I was embarrassed to give this as a gift but explained to my friend what happened. I love Pocky and we used to be able to buy it at the Giant Food grocery store here, but no more. During the recession, many grocery stores have removed stock that does not sell rapidly and I suppose Pocky was one such item. The previous Pocky I've eaten are a crispy biscuit dipped in chocolate and very tasty. I cannot comment on the taste of this marketplace product since my friend did not offer to share."
2,Third house - third time installing,"Its been about 10 years since I last installed a Petsafe system, and for whatever reason I am not happy with the ""new"" collar performance. Its not consistant at all. I order a replacement, which seemed better, but I still find it not giving a warning and then not proceeding to shock. VERY BAD. I need consistancy for effective traiing."
3,Dog Fence Review,Not as effective as we had thought. The field around the wire that sets of the correcting signal is not wide enough. We had to improvise in our laying plan.
3,Cute story...,"On the backcover:SHE WAS A VIRGIN - Kirsten Bond was a mother by virtue of adopting her last sister's child. No one knew Jeffrey wasn't really hers and she vowed never to reveal that is father was actually Rowe Sevrin, Viscount Aragon. But then she was assigned to work with the handsome viscount and she found herself falling for the enemy...AND A MOTHER - Rowe was puzzled by the flame-haired beauty's mixture of innocence and passion. As a mother, how could she be as inexperienced as she seemed? Nor could he deny the bond that immediately formed between him and Jeffrey- or his striking resemblance to the boy. Still, Rowe knew he never could have forgotten a woman like Kristen...or could he?I will say that this doesn't have much in the way of romance for our hero and heroine, but it was a cute story nevertheless. If you are looking for a ""typical"" romance story, this will definitely do the trick. Well written, the characters really came alive."
5,Great insight on JT and family,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. Areas of great interest to me were his family history as well as the memories of his childhoood and young adulthood, his parent's relationship,and his many friendships with people I had no idea he was friends with, etc. I also enjoyed the section where he shared personal insights and info about various songs and what they meant to him. Great book."
2,Boring,Too much history! Felt like I was reading a history book. Would have liked more personal info.
3,Not his best,"There are some good tracks on this album, and all of them are excellently engineered. This album, however, doesn't live up to Fun With Knives for me. It almost sounds like he's trying to imitate more than innovate. Like I said, great engineering, that really melds well the psy-trance and electro-industrial styles of music, but it feels clunky, and a little forced. In my opinion, Fun With Knives was a much cleaner, more enjoyable piece of work."
3,"Good, but the acting is heavy-handed","This 1952 hour and a half film starring Marlene Dietrich playing Marlene Dietrich in another western, singing, hamming it up, and acting as if she were masterly and sexually irresistible, will undoubtedly be enjoyable by her fans. However the acting is heavy-handed and campy. We see actors expressing overly strong feelings of curiosity, hatred, jealousy, and the like. We see an actor laughing inappropriately. It is almost, but not quite, like the non-speaking films where the actors had to show their feelings on their faces because they couldn't vocalize them.It is the 1870s. Dietrich runs a hideout for bandits and takes a tenth of their loot for housing them. Two bandits kill the fiancé of a man who gives up everything to revenge her death. One bandit kills the other, leaving him only one man to find. He comes to Dietrich's ranch, finds many bandits, but needs to identify which one is his fiancé's murderer and take his revenge."
5,The Hollywood Book of Scandals,"The book came super fast, packaged perfectly (in cardboard so it did not bend or get damaged) and in excellent condition. Thank you!"
3,Disappointed that the book is not illustrated by Dr Seuss,I thought this was a Dr Seuss book but it turns out he has only done the text and the book is illustrated by somebody else. Dr Seuss illustrations seem to be really popular with my child but this book has not become one of his favourite books.
4,Gosh I love this book!,"Three animals compete in the first half of the book to see who can have the most apples on top of their head. During the second half of the book, they escape an angry mob, happily collide with an apple truck, and end up giving the entire town ten apples on their heads as well. (What fun! Ten apples up on top! We are not going to let them drop!)This is a good book both for early readers, and for young children learning to talk. Very simple, rhyming vocabulary, of the sort with intuitive spellings (so much of English orthography is a mess...!)Please note that I do not recommend the board book version at all. They cut out the entire second half of the book, as well as good parts of the first half. In addition, the board book is poorly constructed. Just wait and get the real version instead."
3,Nice but no gold star - Didn't get from Amazon,"I got this from the local store. I thought it was a safe buy after all it have the SpongeBob theme song. I was wrong, I figure the song Hollaback Girl would have been censored and since there was not warnings on the CD thought it was OK. Cursing on the 1st track. Other wise it is a nice collection of songs. Another CD that disappointed me because there was no warning label about bad language."
4,best filtered water faucet I've found,I like the quality look of the faucet and the valve handle operates very smoothly . The only thing that would make it better was if it had some type of aerator in the nozzle since the water splashes coming out. After having had this faucet a while my filters have gotten slower since my initial installation and the water no longer splashes coming out.
2,Leaked from the beginning.,This thing was purchased for our reverse osmosis system and has dripped slowly since installation. Got this one because it seemed to be a bit more reasonable than the online competition but do not recommend it because of the problem.
4,"Clean design, reasonable quality",A vast improvement over the cheap dispenser that came with the Culligan filter unit both in terms of design and quality. Wish it were even more heavy duty though. It still feels rather delicate.
1,Clever title. Heavy as a pachyderm.,"A bit ponderous. Way too much bloviating from a skilled writer. Can think of about six other books in this genre that are more deft, helpful and graceful."
3,good graphics and sound but not the same like R2,"THE GAME HAS VERY GOOD QUALITY,SOUND,AND IT HAS THE POSSIBILITY TO GET 5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF LANGUAGES,AND VOICES,,,THE GAME IS GOOD ,,BUT IS NOT THE SAME LIKE RAYMAN 2,,,,I DONT KNOW !SOMETHING IS MISSING,,,,,,,,FRANKLY,,,I AM A BIT DISSAPOINTED,,,,,THE LEVELS ARE MONOTONOUS AND BORING,,SURELY THIS IS THE LAST TIME I WILL SEE RAYMAN,,,...."
4,Not as good as the first two,"After playing both previous rayman games and loving them, I decided that rayman 3 might be a great game for my 5 year old daughter. She loves the colors and magical feel of the levels, but the game is very hard for her to maneuver. It even took me a while to get a handle on the controls. I would not recommend this game for younger players, but even for older players I would say rayman 2 is much better."
3,Nice movie but Blu Ray edition has no features,"The movie is a nice family movie and I do recommend but I gave only a 3-star rate because teh movie has only 2.0 english audio, no subtitles, and not a single extra feature. Never saw a Blu-Ray with so poor options..."
5,The man Who Saved Christmas,This is a good and heart warming family movie for the holidays. It shows the sadness of war during that time period but how one man loved children and happiness so much that he brought joy to all through his toy making!
5,Mr. Gilbert Also Goes to Washington,"My wife and I give this movie two thumbs up, and she gave it one star less. She also said it wasn't your traditional Christmas movie. Set around WWI, Christmas is alive and well but war also encroaches, tugging at the heart as loved ones await the fate of a favorite son who goes MIA. The cast radiates in this real life drama and the cinematography captures the essence of early 20th century Christmas with great lighting and eye candy. Mr. Gilbert really does go to Washington and manages to really save Christmas from a group of rabid congressmen. Okay, maybe they were mostly stuffy. A wonderful story, true Christmas and war. It goes up in my list as one we're glad we bought."
4,Real life Christmas magic,"This movie is about a little known piece of American history that you should know. Have you heard of Erector sets? What about the man who created them? Who would have guessed that a toy maker had such an influence on the homefront of a world war? I don't want to give away too many details that will spoil a first time viewing. I will say it's a wonderful true life lesson about the power of the heart and how important it is to hold on to what brings you hope, especially in the most difficult of times. It's not preachy. It's not heavy handed.this is meant for the whole family to enjoy, to learn from and to remember fondly.I recommend it."
3,not as good as I thought,"These were not worth the money. Kind of blah. No tart, strong cherry taste. They may be called Happy Cherries, but they do not taste like Happy Cherries."
4,Still Worthwhile,"Michael Loewe's ""Everyday Life In Early Imperial China"" was first published in 1968. The current paperback is a 2005 reprint. It is unchanged from the original edition except for adding a few references in the back. Although 37 years old, the book is still worth having, as a pleasant and well-rounded introduction to life in the Han Dynasty. Topics covered include government, occupations, trade, etc. Like other books in the ""Everyday Life"" series, it is easy to understand. It is suitable for adult readers, and also as a supplement in high school, homeschool, and beginning college courses."
2,Xmas Bummer,I was under the impression that a hoop was attached this. In reality its a flat piece of plastic. Kind of goes against the whole *basketball* theme to me!!! So my son throws the ball against the flat plastic and NOTHING!!! The sensors are at the bottom of the plastic?!? like nowhere near where the hoop is *supposed* to be. So my son runs up and presses the bottom so the thing will talk! You be the judge....
3,don't spend the money get a cheaper model,"I am about tired of the one handed gerber claim to fame, this is my 3 or 4th one, I am send this one back, it's just not worth the money. I am really starting to like my old leatherman folder better. It is just easier to use, all the locking stuff and flipping and squeezing is getting old, and it's heavy."
2,Disappointment,"The first day that my diesel arrived I was checking (opening and closing) the various tools/blades, while I was doing that one of the sliding lock mechanism's popped off. I own an earlier model of the Gerber multi tool which has given me very good service, as a result I was very disappointed how easy this one fell apart."
3,Diesel Review,I purchased the Gerber 22-01470 Diesel Needlenose to replace a lost leatherman tool. First this unit is heavy on your hip. It looks sturdy I haven't put to real punishment yet but have used it for general use. The one item that bothers me the most is my leatherman would fold completely around to access the blade and tools. To get the tools in and out takes several steps and the sleeves get in the way the tools. I was little disappointed with this item although I will continue to use. For the average Joe I would recommend a smaller tool.
4,Gerber Diesel rating,Nice product.However you may want to checkout the Gerber Suspension Multiplier as an alternative buy
1,Missing item,"The item has not yet arrived. We were gone mid-Jan. to mid-March, but our mail was being forwarded. I sent an email to the book source inquiring about the matter, but have received no answer. Not sure who is at fault here, but I would like to know if I will be receiving the item."
3,fantastic,"this book is well written, extremely well researched & has a very good mix of humor to add to all the dry facts. The only downfall to this book is that it fails to mention on a few occasions, Americas part played in some of the events. It also doesnt mention at all alleged the coup in America in which JFK, was assassinated. Definitely worth reading."
5,da bomb!,grew up watching this movie crazy to see that it was available for purchase on amazon and for a great price cant beat this
1,Not recommended,This game was only 9.99 at Walmart. They must have priced it according to fun level. My girls and I have this game and there is nothing to it. You don't get to do anything other than line up arrow. Save your money. Don't buy the PS1 verson.
1,MY EYES!!!!! THE PAIN!!!!!,"practically everything that can go wrong with a book did in this one. i couldn't understand a STINKING word this girl said! i just couldn't follow this girls thoughts. at the end, i finally got to understand what happened to Red, but did it really have to take a hundred pages? i, like another reviewer, had to force myself to finish this book. it was a terribly boring. i think i didn't really enjoy this book because it's one of those stories with a deeper meaning. and i was not about to spend my time with a shovel digging."
3,Okay,I bought this Wii skinz. The item came in good time but it wasn't the item shown on the picture. It was white and blue and not as nice in my opinion.
2,A&L 5th Edition Very Disappointing!,"I purchased this review to help prepare for the ARRT Reinstatement exam following my return to the field, and though I felt that it covered the core content well I was extremely disappointed that so many of the questions, both in the book and on the CD-ROM, had incorrect answers. The expanation of the answers even explained HOW the *correct* answer was incorrect!! Maybe the editors should have taken a little more time! I became very frustrated with this and gave it up for a (more expensive and much more worth it) Kettering Review. Would never recommend this review... especially to new grads taking the ARRT for the first time!!"
2,Mary,Just took the registry in May 2004. This study guide was of very little use. The questions on the real registry are structured totally different than the way the book presents the material. Very little positioning questions or anatomy on the real registry. Only about 40% of the registry questions are covered in this book. Keep your textbooks and save your money.
5,This is a must have.,If you want to pass your registry exam get this book in its lastest edition. I tried to study on my own and I couldn't pull it together. I passed my exam on my first try. I highly recommend this book.
3,Six Days in June,The product is flaws in two respects:(1) There were no maps with the Kindle edition although I suspect there were maps in the hard copy. Without maps it is impossible to follow the narrative.(2) The electronic transfer was really sloppy. There is at least one typo on almost every page. Louse quality control!
2,small but good,"This is a small ribbon, basically it's a toy more than a functional ribbon for dance. The stick is about 12 inches long. The ribbon is just over an inch wide and just over 83 inches long. That being said, the swivel is good and the ribbon does have a good float. This would work best for a young child, maybe a preschooler."
2,"Lady Camellias, very serious","If you are lighthearted and enjoy happy and joyful productions, you should be aware that this production is a very serious one. If you are new to ballet and want a great single tape I would recommend something from the Kirov ballet such as ""Swan Lake"" or ""Sleeping Beauty"". Those are great and traditional productions with a good range of expression from serious to joyful.This tape is rather stark in most of the scenes being two or three people with one chair and one color backgroud and one piano accompanyment. There are a couple of scenes of a larger scale with full orchestra, but unfortunately, these are rather short. The audio is quite well preserved, but the vidio is a bit rough in places since it has been duplicated from film.For long time ballet fans, this may be a FANTASTIC find, but for me, it is a bit too serious, too much like an unspoken soap opera... but I have to add that I just got the tape and maybe over time I will learn to love it."
1,do not buy this toy,do not buy this toy online. it breaks very easily and it is not sturdy and dangerous. if you want one get it target. it is only 1.99 compared to what you have to pay online and plus the shipping
2,Was not a hit,"Unfortunately the color sent was pink and my 3 year old grandson wouldn't even try it. It really wan't a microphone, just an echo that sounded like you were talking into a soup can. Too cheap to spend the money to return it so it will go to GoodWill."
1,AWFUL!!,Hate it! Very disappointing. You literally have to YELL into this thing to get any kind of response. Its not fun at all for my child. She hasn't touched it since she opened it on Christmas. I would return it but I may pay more in shipping than this item cost.
3,Good,its ok for small kids who just want to play around and sing but the mic doesn't do much. Its a good toy for kids to play around with and have fun pretending to sing.
5,Used to be called Brookstone Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I have used these to drown out ventilation fan noise, which lulls me to sleep at work. I bought these same headphones under the Brookstone brand for $99 3 years ago. (Unfortunately, I lost them on a USAIR flight.) It worked better than the pair of PlaneQuiet NC6 headphones I have now. The wires unplug from the headset allowing you to wear them without the encumbrance of wires. Also has variable degrees of noise cancellation. Audio on headset works even without batteries (though noise cancellation will work only with batteries). Best buy for the money."
3,Was that fuzzy mess on my TV really 'The Lodger' ?,"As you can probably guess from the title of my review, the entire 3 stars for this DVD is for 'Sabotage'. This print of 'The Lodger' should be consigned to the garbage can where it belongs - it is totally unwatchable. This is such a pity since 'The Lodger' is easily Hitchcock's best silent work. There are at least two better prints available, one of which is a newly restored version that is amazingly good even on VHS, so get this one instead (I own a PAL VHS copy). Picture quality for 'Sabotage' is mercifully very good. Hitchcock was really getting in to his stride with 'Sabotage' and the film contains the infamous scene where a young boy, an old woman and a dog are sitting on a bus next to a bomb. The bomb slowly ticks away and at 1.45pm .... well, I suggest you see for yourselves - and as this is one of Laserlight's budget DVDs, you can afford to as well."
3,Shame on Hitch,"The only way this dvd gets even three stars is because of Sabotage. It's pretty good, not one of Hitch's best. But it's better than The Lodger. Anything has to be better than that. For anyone who adored the book, the movie is a huge disapointment. It was nothing like the book! The book was chilling and suspenseful, with an ending that leaves you wanting more. The movie was completely different. There were no chills, no thrills, and just went on and on. And with a happy ending! What's the fun in that? A thriller shouldn't have such a happy ending. Shame on you, Hitch! Anyone who's thinking of buying this one, I recommend reading the book. It's a heck of a lot better. Read it on a dark stormy night. It's fabulous if you want to be scared. If you want to be bored and to be put to sleep, watch the movie."
5,Awesome and cheap,My 2yr old loves singing and we've had other echo mics before. This one seems louder than the others. Plus the price is great.
1,Not what I expected,I was looking for a mic for my 3 year old. This does not have an off/on switch. It has a fake button. It is not a real mic. It just allows the child to hear their echo. And they will have to put their mouth practically on top of the mic. Maybe a fun toy for a 1 year old. Would not recommend for older toddlers. Go to Lakeshore Learning for a better mic.
4,Cute entertainment,Great toy for my 20 month old but when her uncle saw it he wanted one. The shipping price was a but steep (more then the toy itself) but all stores sold out.
3,Four Film Favorites: Cop Comedy Collection,"I have always been a fan of the Police Academy movies, but however ... I have until now only seen the 1st three of the movies. The others were decent, not as good in my opinion, but still worth having all of them to complete the entire collection.Loaded Weapon was hilarious . . . overall, this purchase is warranted if you like any of the other Police Academy movies or if you're into cheesy cop comedies."
5,This TV Tuner is what it's supposed to be.,"The seller did his job, he's not at fault but this is a piece of crap, tv tuner. This tuner was $100.00 new, the software has numerous problems, if it was mine to sell, I'd put it in file 13. G D"
3,of risotto and regret..,"Frankly this book brought Sticky to new depths of sadness and depression as Adriana (the titular Woman of Rome) abandoned all hope and care and sunk to prostitution and risotto. It is the latter which saddened Sticky the most, our protagonist creating ever more bland risottos with every turn of the page, and forsaking the sticky rice teachings of the kind Chinese laundry gentleman who ran the little laundry on the Via Di Consolazione.A devastating read..."
1,king of games,this game is pathetic.I had chessmaster 2 for ps1 and it was much better (larger chessboards +actual controls)do not buy this mini screen squinter!now you know K.G. out
1,Chessmaster Disappointing,"I had become addicted to the Chessmaster for the PC so when I heard the new one was coming out for PS2 - I pre-ordered it. The day it came I walked right in and started playing. Let me just say I was highly disappointed. The graphics compared ot the PC version are not that impressive and there weren't a whole lot of options for different boards, pieces, etc. And the so-called ""Battlefield Chess"" leaves a lot to be desired. ...."
2,Politically motivated film,Enter the United States of America legally and then obey the laws of the United States of America and you won't be deported. So I really didn't have empathy for the situation. The acting was terrific. Action slow and sometimes tedious.
4,The Visitor,"I liked this very predictable film. I have been told I like odd things though. It is possibly considered an Art Film, and is a low budget film that should be recognizeed for what it is saying about our culture.If you like an artsy film that is a little sappy in areas and definitely pretictable you'll like it too. Don't watch it looking to put a polical stamp of approaval on it just enjoy.I have now watched this film for the third time and I have to say I like more each time. I gets me thinking and talking about how we Americans look at ourselves, our jobs and other people. It speaks of aging, loneliness, and stangers.I highly recommend this film."
2,"Buy the bundle, throw away the game, keep the controller, and import Japanese versions.","Konami's famous beatmania series hits the US PlayStation 2 in all the wrong ways possible. beatmania offeres the worst of both worlds as the classic beatmania ""djing"" gameplay is mixed with the worst songs in the series. A mixture of OLD and REALLY OLD beatmania tracks give the poor impression on the average American gamer whose oblivious to the series. Instead of Konami aiming this game as a club style game like what they do with DDR, they should have ported a modern Japanese release with all the trippy music and anime which appeals to so many Americans. Get this bundle for the controller and import Japanese beatmania games instead."
2,missed the mark,If you are already a technical person who is looking for more information...skip this book. Unfortuneatly it is vague and unhelpful. I say this technically speaking...if you are curious about the process and just want to pick up a bit of vocabulary.. have a look. They could have done a great job with this book... but once again the process falls flat. Don't let the cover fool you.
4,good intro to casting,"I started casting by winging it and messed up a nice sculpture and realized I really needed help. It's not the most exhaustive book on the subject, I might like to know how to cast more than plaster or rubber. But it really is a very good step by step for some very basic, good casting methods; both how to make the mold and how to cast with it. I now know what I did wrong! and how not to make the same mistake again. I like how the author writes, it is very accessible and his intent is to make the process easy to understand. Very good book on the subject!"
3,Moms must just not get it!,My son wanted a Lego General Grevious Chase for his birthday. I was told that they didn't even make the toy anymore so I found it on Amazon. I was surpirsed to see that it was almost $200 but knew Lego products were expensive. I buckled and purchased it anyway. I was floored when I received it in the mail. It is TINY! I thought I would be getting some huge box for that price! Maybe I just don't get it but this is ridiculous! My son better play with this thing daily for a whole year! I am never doing this again!I did want to say that the vendor shipped the product very quickly and I was very pleased with that.
4,As good as possible,"Books of this nature are always limited by timeliness (sites come and go -- and change -- so quickly). The fifth star is only withheld because of that unavoidable limitation. This is as good and complete a guite to auto racing on the Web as I can imagine. I'm an auto racing nut who's been online for almost 20 years, and I found stuff I had never seen in this book. Kudos to the author."
2,Kite Runner is a disappointment,"This story was a high school (senior class) assignment. I did not appreciate such graphic storyline for my child. The movie was difficult to view in two ways. First the ""rape"" scene was enough to make one sick; a nine-year-old boy attacked by three male bullies and left to drip blood in the sand as he tries to walk home was a bit too much. The second problem was with the movie. It was difficult to read the captioning because of the color of the letters in contrast to blending with the color in the background. The captions moved quickly so you couldn't really watch the screen and read too. The movie did allow for hearing the cultural music and view the setting of the story if one isn't familiar. Over all I did not enjoy this experience with my daughter."
2,the kite runner,"i would have preferred to know up front that the majority of the dialogue was in a foreign language withsub titles. The titles were difficult to read, as the letters were light against a light background.We had read the book and loved the story, but the dvd was difficult to follow without being able to readthe dialogue"
5,Very well done,"Very few, if any, movies can match great books whence they came word-for-word, scene-for-scene. It's just not possible. Books and movies are different communications media. Take ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies, for example. Those are non-stop action movies--the mere skeleton of the books, omitting many ancillary characters and tangential story lines. The same with this story. The movie very ably captured the heartrending essence of the book. Excellent performances all around. If you want all the details and interior monologues, read the very excellent book. But, if you want a quick glimpse of war-torn Afghanistan, watch the movie."
2,Very Disappointed in Movie,"The book was an excellent read with a profoundly deep storyline. The DVD was a great disappointment. There was so much left out that if I had not read the book, I wouldn't have known what was going on. Don't watch the DVD, read the book!"
5,Still lasting tragedy,"This story written by then Afghanistan native is a worthy testimony to modern history in making.Although, perhaps, not all Soviet ""Russian"" soldiers were ""quickie""-thirsty and not all terrorists were sex-obsessed, I like this movie because throwing away all blubbing of enduring the Western democracy somewhere, it simply dismantles a real face of a bunch of murderers, those terrorising even own folks rapists, paedophiles and simply liars playing religious card worldwide while, regrettably, even the most educated victims of them bring about and spread hatred and intolerance to any place they have refuge and new life in.Good luck in the States-The Land of the Free to boys performing the main film characters: their screenplay is superb, and, surely, grown up in liberated Afghanistan, they surely know who is their friend and who is not, regardless of biology new country-citizens belong to."
5,From Naperville,"There are a ton of different sales books out there, and more written each day. From strategic to rainmaker, each plows into a well-worked strategy to get the sale and be the star. Yet, one must know the basics well, and this book does that in a complete fashion. Great for beginers, but essential for us all to run through so our heads don't get to big. The biggest message in this book is process - setting one and keeping to it. By having a process, one can look for the next target, with the knowledge that the ones in the pipeline are easy to identify as to status and progress. The fact that ACT! chose to use the 11 steps was also interesting. Worth the amazon.com price!"
2,Cliche Selling Approach For The 60s-80s,"I read this book with great expectations, thinking that the Dale Carnegie School of Thought should have something useful and great to say about selling this time.As it turns out, this book is poorly written, and is so naive about selling in such a hypercompetitive business world these days.If Dale Carnegie is still alive, he can definitely write a better book on selling since his writing is more persuasive, and his suggestions on selling should be more practical and convincing.At least, Dale Carnegie is a good salesman himself, with a strong philosophical rather than just how-tos, jargons-filled perspective on selling.Try Non-manipulative Selling or SPIN Selling, you can get more dollars out of reading them instead."
3,Fun to read but misses dramatic opportunity,"While this trilogy is a fairly entertaining Voyager adventure, it is disappointing to me in that it never really exploits (or even defines!) the theoretical ""substance"" known as ""dark matter"" (residual from the Big Bang and theorized as filling all ""empty"" space and impelling the expansion of the universe at an accelerating rather than decelerating speed) used in the title. In so doing, it misses the opportunity of being ten times as suspenseful. The fate of the known physical universe would hang in the balance in such a circumstance as proposed by this story but this is never conveyed to the reader because ""dark matter"" isn't really explained at all. I know some people hate technobabble but a few simple paragraphs of exposition lifted from a user-friendly ""Nova"" segment on PBS I recently saw would have added so much to the drama."
3,"Not great, but not bad","This is the first Star Trek book I've picked up in some time (the last go-round being DS9's Millennium trilogy), and I have to say I enjoyed the first leg of this journey. The writing is simple and easy to follow, and the story is entertaining. I'm not fond of the ""Little Dagger"" sub-plot, though I am intrigued by where it will go in the second and third books.All in all, a good (and fairly quick) read."
5,Fly to the Rainbow,"One of the unsung heros of the guitar puts his best foot foward with this two disc offering. He skillfully blends the art and beauty of some of the world's greates classical composers with the soul and energy of Jimi Hendrix. The result... a must have for anyone who loves music. If Roth has one weakness, it's his singing voice (though I like it, it is definately an acquired taste) - not to worry with this awesome set, as it is pure instrumental heaven."
4,Lights,These definitely light up pretty bright and its relatively easy to get it to work. I have been lazy so I have not installed them but I tried out the lights and they work and flash in different modes. If you are not looking to open up any consoles and want a easy install. Go to a electronic store and find the cigarette lighter plug that attach to the black and red wires. It is very easy and you dont even need to strip the wires. Good luck. Get them if you want a nice little flash to your vehicle.
5,Cool Product,I thought this was going to be a waster of money but it is actually really cool. The lights go perfectly to the beat and my boyfriend is beyond happy with it.
4,led interior lights,bright lights.look great at night. overall a good buy had them around two months with no problems. recommend for anyone looking for that extra touch to their ride
4,Night lights,"I'm very happy with this product, it has a ton of settings and I love the way it looks at night! I gave it a ""like it"" instead of a ""love it"" because if your a girl who doesn't know anything about cars good luck installing it... other than that this product is super cool."
4,....Led Glow review.....,"I ordered the led glow on jan 28 came jan 31th, surprised how fast i received my order....As far as the product goes it's what i wanted good lighting and not hard too hook up (if you have basic wireing skills) The downs are the remote seems a lil on the cheap side but it does the job, not going to complain for the price..."
4,Great product.. Just get some extras,"The product came and I thought I was going to have problems, when you pick it up and feel them they feel really cheap. They are awesome lights tho. I have not had them long so I don't know about the quality of them. Came fast and they look awesome. The only thing is you need more wire to connect to your battery."
4,Rich and Strange,"I found I already had the movie in a compilation. The one sent is somewhat darker than the one I already have. Both have about a 30 second blackout so you never figure out how/why the uncle gave the couple the money. Otherwise, fun movie."
4,enchanting music,"The combination of vocal and a wind instrument unique to parts of southeast Asia make for interesting listening. While this is not a professional production, it is still of excellent quality and I would recommend it for collectors of Asian ethnic music."
3,Nice box but....,The box worked very well with more bells and whistles then you really need. I had it for 2 years but if you are using it on stage it will not hold up. I have asked around and hear its the same problem. eventually it will continually run through all the programs without stooping.
2,fun but limited,"There was so much hype about this game I couldn't wait to buy it. After playing it for a little while, I couldn't help but be disappointed. The graphics are terrible which was surprising. You can't change the guitar from L to R and vice versa so you're stuck using one hand to control the buttons. This game gets dizzying after a few songs and is extremely tempramental. The songs are great but it ends there."
5,LOVE IT!,THIS GAME IS AWESOME! THE FIRST NIGHT I GOT IT I STAYED UP VERY LATE PLAYING IT. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!
4,"Lots of recreational fun, but the challenge can be a bar for social gaming","This game is definitely a blast, but for casual or social gaming (someone's over at your house, you have a couple of beers, and you decide to play a game), the learning curve is too steep; I've had a girlfriend and best friend give it a try and just give up because it's too challenging.For me, a regular gamer, I had an easier time starting up and have really enjoyed playing. Personally, the difference in challenge between easy (which I won with very little effort) and medium (which, after beating ""easy"", I proceeded to lose repeatedly the first song) is dramatic, again almost prohibitively so.But I love the songs (I LOVE being able to jam to all the old classic rock songs), I think the music quality is great, and there's definitely plenty of challenge. Wish there were more songs, but this is definitely worth buying, particularly if you're a fan of classic rock."
3,The newer guitar is better,"We purchased this game and guitar primarily for the second guitar. We like the World tour guitar much better. This game has much of the same songs as World Tour as well. We should have bought something else, but this works okay."
3,Game is ok,"I bought this game for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves the fact that its guitar hero, but this particular game ""legends of rock"" was not as entertaining as we had hoped. The graphics are pretty basic and ""boring"", but also pretty provocative for a 12 year old. She would have enjoyed World Tour more. Overall, its a fun game I just wouldn't recommend Legends of Rock game to go with it."
3,Great game with some limitations,"Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock BundlePros:Extremely fun gameplay, fun for whole family (my 4 yr old daughter and Mom both enjoy it).Cordless guitar gives better freedom for ""rocking"".Cons:70 plus songs, but only 20 plus that I have heard of - most of these titles received limited airtime and definitely didn't chart.Vocals are off - some songs use different singers.Crowd is lame - one guy and one girl cloned to make large crowd.Choice of songs for classic bands - The Who, Aerosmith, and Blue Oyster Cult used less popular songs than I would have liked.Choice of songs/bands - Slayer? Please. - why not more Eric Clapton? Also - why ""Number of the Beast"" by Iron Maiden? It's a classic to some, but definitely not one I'll play in front of my daughter.Overall - great gameplay for the first week or so... then the songs get rather old. I'm only hoping the Wii comes out with GH1 & GH2."
2,"Fun, but outputs in mono sound","As pointed out, the game at this time does not output sound in stereo or Dolby Pro Logic II. Also, there is no Co-op Quickplay.Both these features were in Guitar Hero 2, so it seems the game has taken a step down in certain areas. Otherwise, it's what you would expect. Lots of fun if you can ignore the mono sound, but I would wait for Activision to release a fixed version before buying this."
1,A Mockery & Waste of Money!,"HORRIBLE! I had no idea when I bought this game (used, Thank GOD) for my son that it was influenced by Satanic undertones. I realize the game is rated ""T"" for Teen, but this is totally inappropriate even for teens to play. How utterly disgusting it was to see my son battling Satan in a guitar competition. I immediately yanked the game from the PS2 & returned it! Why do companies have to deliberately mock & make light of the spiritual warfare that is REALLY going on?Is it really necessary to incorporate Satanic symbols and images on a guitar game? Very disturbing & very sad."
5,Guitar Hero for Wii,"I can't even begin to describe how fun this is! I initially bought it for my 13 year old son as a birthday present. However, I find I am having as much fun on it as he is (though I am not nearly as good)!!!! The entire family enjoys Guitar Hero. We had to purchase a second guitar so that we could ""battle"" and create bands! I hope that there will be several more music releases for Guitar Hero! Strongly recommend for young and old alike (not that I am ""old""--I am just a mom who is ""young at heart"")!"
1,"Wrox is Dead, and This Book [is not good]","As much as I love Wrox and mourn its passing, this book is one of the worst books available. It is full of typos, is almost indecipherable, and provides almost no useful knowledge of J#.J# is a transition technology, and the world needs some good books about it. But this isn't one.Don Kiely..."
2,nothing special,"Nothing about 'how to'. This is just a bunch of, here we are and watch me shoot this thing. There is no instruction on how to call them in or what call works for what."
1,Not as expected,"I didn't purchase this item as a ""toy"". I thought this was one of those peel off things that I could place on a rear window of my car. I didn't use the item because you must put the thing in water, etc. I threw the thing away. Besides that it took a long time to arrive by mail, even though my credit card was charged instantly."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"Not really sure what to say about this book. I found it so tedious to read. It is extremely mundane. The author describes every little thing and has tons of internal dialect before getting to the point. I will read the second book, only because the world Rob has built is interesting. Not that she actually had the brothers doing anything interesting though. There was so much more she could've done. I mean one of the main characters is half demon. He was kidnapped and brought back to the demon world and remained there for two ""demon"" years (two days in Earth years) later he remembers nothing! Nothing? That alone was a great opportunity to create a good story and instead she let it slip by."
2,Nightlife,"I have read all 5 books for this series. You know there are series that you love so much you can't wait for the next new book to come out. Or you love it so much you re-read the entire series for when the new book arrives it all flows together. Well, this series is not one of them. I read all 5 because I bought them. The were rated high and sounded good. They were okay to read, and that's it. Will I buy the new book when it comes out? NOPE!"
3,It was okay but not great,I actually liked this book but found it to be great but not really memorizing to me. I liked the characters but they seemed kind of wooden and I am not a big fan of first perspective for a novel unless the character has some interesting perspectives and find that this very one has some issues. I do have a problem with how slow things seem to progress and felt that ideas were rather old and have been done many times before. However it has a lot of potential to be a good series.
2,What The H*LL!,"I am an avid reader, and I love urban fantasy. I picked this book up on the rec of some friends--usually our tastes mesh. This time they didn't. This is the worst book I did not finish. I read...no WADED THROUGH 40 pages of nothing...there was no progress, no forward movement. It was all backstory. By the time I set it down, I was so mad I was seeing RED! I have never in my life felt so cheated...matter of fact this is the first book I ever returned for my money back--and I bought it with a gift certificate. That's how bad it was."
1,Not worth the money,"I would have been better off buying a black onesie and some black pants and some gold fabric paint. The costume was very uncomfortable for my barely 2 yr old. It was very thin material and the back was open, no fasteners along most of it. So with the wind blowing the cape up his back was exposed to the cold. The mask didn't fit/work at all. It is a poor material, poorly sewn together, painted with fabric paint. Worth $3-5 maybe - $20+ not a chance. Don't waste your money."
3,son of a legend...,"I don't imagine any of us really know what it is like to be the son of a legend..the incredible pressure that must come with living up to your father..it sounds like a wonderful easy life but as Stephen Bogart let's us know it's not..a book full of anecdotes and stories, self-examination, a bit too much whining for my tastes but nevertheless some tasty morsels can be found in this book.."
1,Very Stiff shoes...no give at all,"I just could not even attempt to ""break"" these in - they are like concrete!"
3,Good introduction to the mechanics of the market,"Rather than providing any sort of investment advice, this book explains the actual workings of the stock market. How a trade flows from a customer, through a broker, to the floor, and on to the various settlement engines. It's good background for anyone who invests in the market, and especially useful to anyone who works in (or with) the financial IT industry.As other reviewers have noted, the poor copy-editing is embarassing. But even with all the typos, the information presented is very useful."
1,broke first day,Within 2 minutes the wrench broke. Busted into pieces. I would definitely go with a different brand. This brand is GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!
3,Could've been better,"At 54.95 this is a very expensive DVD, is it worth it? If you want to learn about massage in hopes of pursuing a career in massage therapy I wouldn't recommend it. I felt the video did not focus enough on massage but on other topics such as setting the mood and how to advertie which was nothing but super-obvious tips and not very helpful. I don't think the DVD alone is going to help you and for [...] bucks is an awfully expensive supplement to in-person instruction. As for those with a more lets say more casual interest in massage I have to inform you that that the amount of massage in this video is very dissapointing. You have about 20 minutes of the man face up, then about 20 minutes of the woman (gorgeous) face down, naked, with only her posterior covered. The massage is filmed beautifully and better than those you can see for free on YouTube, but again for [...] bucks I feel is too expensive if you want to just watch for fun."
2,Not what I expected,The handles are diagonal in design which--when trying to press to open--becomes difficult. Why is the handle diagonal??? Doesn't make sense to me. I literally have to use both hands to clamp down the handle to open wide enough to use. Not want I wanted or expected.
4,fun with pogo favourites,"fun, especially if you're a club pogo member. these games are nothing that you haven't seen on the page, although the ""new"" folks you play against are a nice change of pace. the conversation can be a little boring, however. nice to be able to quickly change games when riding the tide becomes a bit too much and the backache sets in. highly recommended and a must have for any pogo addict....like me!"
4,Very intriguing,"""The Defection of A. J. Lewinter"" is a great book and a page-turner at that. A guy you wouldn't give a second thought to decides to defect while on a trip to Tokyo. As the Americans you have to decide if the defector has anything worth defecting for! At the same time the Russians have to do their best to figure out if he's genuine or a plant!If you've ever seen a cat chasing its tail then you'll get a kick out of this book. Everyone is chasing shadows and the one caught in the middle is A.J. Lewinter. The ending is a great little plot twist and a thoroughly enjoyable read."
2,Tape recorder dump,"There may be something worthwhile here, but I was beaten down by the endless large quotes - in the body or in the grey offsets - which were repetitive and added not that much.No spine, no real point of view or historical context. Just the usual suspects saying all of the expected things: Instigator rule bad. Fighting useful.This was basically a clip job which could have been so much more."
2,poker machine,"Not very impressed. Buy a handheld one, more colorful and does just as much as this one."
3,"Worked okay, but came with their own pain","My wife has the type of ears that pop when we go up a hill and her experiences flying came with intense pain.She tried these and they were very uncomfortable going in (almost painful), uncomfortable to wear (almost painful), but did work on the pressure-related pain on the flight down to see family.On the flight back she triedFlitemate Pressure Reducing Ear Plugsand they were fairly comfortable to put in, fairly comfortable to wear, and worked perfectly. The Flitemate wins the comparison testing for her.No matter which you go with, I understand the cleaner you keep them the more uses they will last. Ours has only been used on the first trip so I can't comment any more than that on number of uses.Feel free to leave a comment with any questions. Hope this is helpful!"
1,colored push pins,"The actual pin is fine but, the colors you see are not the colors you get. All you get are the primary colors. Our office was looking for the odd colors..."
5,No one Writes a short story better...,"...Singer explores not only human loneliness but also the human comedy in his short works..the theme of course centers around love, a love that transports you far away, washing you with a tide of emotions...though these tales drawn from the old traditionary school of thought, celebrate the dignity, mastery and unexpected joy of living with moreart and fervor than any other writer...This classic collection explores the varieties of wisdom gained with age and especially those that teach us how to love....the love that ages and matures...just like old wine tasting even better day by day, year after year and tear after tear...these are tales of curious marriages, of divorces, of love curses, bravery and loneliness..."
3,NIce radio,"For the money this is a nice radio. Box says you can pick Zipcode for area, tho I dont see that anywhere."
4,Very nice headphones if you have a normal sized head,"I've owned this headset for just about 7+ months now and I have had zero issues with it's performance. The microphone is crisp and is clear when using Teamspeak or Ventrilo. The sound is clear and the bass is nice and low. I've even dropped them or yanked them off the table by snagging the wire a few times and nothing has happened to them. The only issue I have so far is that there is no adjustment for different sized heads. While the earphones themselves swivel to accomidate most people, I'm a big guy and hence have a larger head. After about 4 hours or so with these headphones on my ears get rather irritated. However I would think they would be fine for a majority of the population. The earphone are somewhat cushioned and are covered with a vinyl type of material that seems to be rather durable. I would recommend this headset to any gamer."
4,"Average Story, great artwork","There isn't anything paticularly spectacular with this issue, just your average unknown villian, which is built up to be unstoppable and then magicly defeated by your heros. The main reason to buy this is for the great interior artwork, which gives an interesting look at the league as they are transformed by an unexplained power it darker versions of themselves, the best of thes being Batman's transformation in which he is left scarcly human. Overall not a a gutwrenching plot, but a decent read for the price which fits well in any collection"
4,Very Useful,"I purchased several review books (about 6) to help me study for the AANP Adult Nurse practitoner exam that I took and passsed in June 2006. Needless to say, I probably bought too many review books but I thought I could use all the extra help since it was almost 4 years since I gradauted from the adult NP program and decided to take the exam. This book was my 2nd favorite book to use, especially the review questions in the CD the book came with. The questions were similiar in format as the AANP exam. My only caution is that some of the answers in CD practice exam did not correspond with the explanation answer. I would highly recommend Fitzgerald's review CD/manual and her review book, Nurse Practitioner Certification Examination and Practice Preparation as the best review source. Fitzgerald would get 5 stars."
4,Wonderful smell.,The geranium scent is my favorite. It smells so good that I ordered it from Amazon when I couldn't find it in the store. Only problem is the container leaks around the pump.
4,Returning to an old favorite,"Traveling Mercies was the first Anne LaMotte book I read. I found it contemporary and stimulating, as well as my test for spending my time reading a book: it was well written. I have since read most of LaMotte's books and passed them on or bought copies for friends. My last read was The Three Prayers, which I purchased 5 copies for others. I was able to introduce my grandchildren to LaMotte, and they have begun sharing them w/their college friends. I purchased this particular copy of Traveling Mercies for"
3,Very basic special effects,"The narration by Glenn Close is very good and the original story by Washington Irving is related very well. However, the special affects are something like an animated puppet show, so it is easy to see why the video is inexpensive."
4,pretty cool,"Cool! I review first! I bought this somewhere else but I thought I'd rate it here. It is really fun, the rolling ship is very innovative and the wookies are cool minifigs. I took off one star for fun since the wheel on the rolling ship doesn't spin well (I'm not sure if it was supposed to) and I was sorta hoping for a land plate with some trees on it or something. I gave it three stars for educational values since it helps with construction and motor skills (and also helps to build future legos) but it wouldn't really help in life. It is really tough and won't break easily; the only reason I gave it two for durability is because the big wheel ship fell off my table and exploded into Lego oblivion, but I was able to rebuid it. I rated it 4 overall, although I was kind of disappointed that there was no land plate, and the spider droid looked kinda goofy-looking compared to Episode II.Overall, cool toy."
5,Excellent for starters!,I recommend this book for beginner to intermediate basketball player who wants to improve skills. Contains everything from defense stance to basketball shooting.
3,Somewhat useful,"I bought this video mostly because I wanted to improve my ball handling. I found some of the drills useful and found the tips on protecting the ball and using behind the back and spin dribbles useful. However, I found ""48 BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP DRILLS"" much more useful."
1,I got the wrong book with the right cover page!,"When I finally got a chance to get to the book weeks after it arrived, I found out that I was sold a wrong book. The removable paper cover was from the book I intended to order but the book was wrong. I am very disappointed and astonished!"
3,Not Great,"Having liked the author's other novel, Invisible Lives, I thought I would try this one out as well. However, it was somewhat dissapointing. The storyline closely resembles my favorite South Asian chick-lit book, For Matrimonial Purposes by Kavita Daswani, which is a much better read. The characters were under developed, the story line superficial and lacking in sufficient detail. The cover design is cute though, so don't be fooled!"
4,Great to leave for the substitute teacher,"I purchased this at my husband's request for him to leave for a substitute teacher when he is absent. It works great in that respect. As to the content, I was expecting a little more of a ""Behind the Music"" format, but it is mostly short clips of other artists commenting on how the work was influential."
1,A complete joke.,"This movie is terrible. It sucks the big one; bad acting, bad special effects, bad writing. It has nothing in common with the original. Don't get it. Don't even think of getting it. It's bad...reeaaaallly bad."
2,"Corny piece of ""terror""","I just saw this movie. I actually enjoyed the first one and the book, but this is kind of a mix between a cheese comedy and a very low budget horror film. The history develops around a town of vampires, settled since the colony times, and an antropologist ""invited"" to write a revindicative book about them. Well, it might sound interesting, but it looses interest at the mid point.Save some bucks and buy other thing, or if you are too curious, rent it."
1,Listening to this was suicide.,"It sounds like a garage band demo made up of pimple faced sixteen year olds that have at least one member that has a rich father so they can afford to produce and sell it. There is a reason it costs under a dollar. Not worth the cost of standard shipping and handling. The vocals are way overdone. Some may like it, but that is just my honest opinion. I did use is as a coaster for a while and so it did have some use."
3,Good general reference starter,"Yes. That's right - i said a place to *start* your research journey.This is in no way, shape, or form a book that will help you write a paper, pass a history course, or understand some obscure literary reference in a poem.If you read it, however, you may just impress Jay Leno when he does his ""Jay Walking"" segments on the Tonight Show.For what it is - an all purpose guide to Western / american culture - it does a good job. I've referenced my copy many times over the years. ie When I'm watching a movie set during the life and times of Horatio Nelson, I've looked up Nelson in the book. When I'm reading a book that takes place during the Napoleonic Wars, I've referenced quite a few things.Is this the entire history of Western / American culture? NO. It's a thumbnail sketch with many, many holes.It is however, quite informative and interesting.As long as you understand what it is and what it isn't - I'd recommend the book."
2,Disappointing Reproduction,"Cullen's famous book, when you can get the original, sells for around $750. The reprint was long in coming but disappointing in regard to the quality, size of printing, and poor clarity. Still OK as a reference book, but I will still be searching for an original I can afford. AMC."
2,Bad quality,"As soon as i started using this product it began to fall apart, the glue for the shoes it was not good, the first time i washed it the fabrics became yellow."
2,Shoulda used horse glue,"These came completely unglued at the flex points on both sides of both shoes. My Vans never did that. Comfy, but unsightly."
3,A great toy but the it is way over priced.,"I got to say this is one of the best toys I ever got. It is pretty durable, it has three clones, one red robot. I like how you control the wings and the bombs but, sometimes the bombs dont drop. Also, the price is crAZY!!! I mean for a price thats $150-$200 it's not really worth it. I only paid 30-50 dollers."
1,Not worth the wait nor the money,"I bought 2 of these players. They each lasted about 2 weeks. I wasn't going to say anything, but since you asked, I was extemely disappointed in the quality or lack of."
1,No Package Yet????,I placed this order on December 7th 2008 and still have not recieved it. I sent them an e-mail earlier his week and have not heard back. I want my package! I am very un-happy...
4,pretty and simple,"Earrings had a simplistic pretty look and feel. I like it very much. I just wish the stone was darker in color. In the picture, it looks medium brown, but in reality it is a light translucent brown."
1,"Very expensive, lots of problems!","I have been an Quickbooks user since 1993. Once you build a datafile, it's very difficult to switch to another software. So you're basically stuck. I have moved up to the Enterprise Soltuions software - as a result of bad, erroneous advice from support at Intuit. In any event, I spend the 1st hour of each morning trying to open my data file. So, if that's what you want to do, by all means by this software. As I write this review I am on hold - once again - for at least 45 minutes. Oh, I take that back, after holding for 45 minutes, the call was dropped so now I have to start all over again. Almost everyday I go through this. Frustrating beyond words."
3,Not bad,Package arrived late. Not as comfortable as I expected. A little on the bulky side. However they do protect your knees as described.
3,right or left?,"OK, I have a stupid question. Which one is right and which is left? When they look correct on my knees, the strap eats into the back of my leg. When i switch them, they look off center, but feel better. Anyone see a right or left tag or mark on theirs?"
2,Poor Quality,"This book was expensive, and for the price, I thought I would be getting a quality published book. The book looks like the pages were photocopied, and the book's pages are printed on one side only. Admittedly, the information in the book may be invaluable, but for that price, the book itself should be a higher quality.Mr. Coslick needs to tighten up his publisher. While it isn't always fair to judge a book by its cover, our human nature causes us to do exactly that. I returned it because in principal I could not see paying that high a price for information I can get in books that are a lot less expensive and better made."
3,Steve Canyon Adventures,A good book to reminisce the old adventures. They don't create comics like this anymore.
3,Does not measure up,"I had high hopes for this product and gave it the full benefit of the doubt. Folks who have never used an epilator before will likely be thrilled with this product but those who have used epilators for years will likely be left uninspired.Pros: a lot less painful than dry epilation, can be used as either wet or dry, convenientCons: does not remove a lot of the hair, takes a lot longer than more powerful epilators and even then does not remove a lot of the hairNot sure why others are suggesting to Panasonic to come up with a model that lets you epilate while the product is plugged in. This is a wet/dry epilator that can be taken in the shower, this is a safety issue and it will never happen."
1,Panasonic razor,"This product did not meet my expectations, and I will likely not use it again.Money wasted."
3,battery is wasted,I bought this product not too long ago. I loved it until the battery wore out and I am not sure what to do about that. I don't want to have to buy a new epilator. Other than that I am pleased with this epilator. If anyone has any suggestions of what to do about my battery let me know! besides I think I may just buy a new one since this one does not work for me. I do not recomment this to anyone!
2,Product Review,"This epilator does the job but the extras do not... the trimmer is useless and because the machine is a slower one, I even had to take off the shield to get it to work in a timely matter. I used to have a very basic epilator that I now realize was very fierce... again , this one will do the job but I thought that I was upgrading to a machine that had more capabilities and granted that I have no interest in the shaver, the overall product is just okay. If you are not used to epilating, need a starter machine and will use the electric shaver bit frequently, this is a great porduct for you. If you are used to epilating and you want something that will get the job done quickly, I would suggest a more basic and powerful device. As for using it in water, I have to admit I haven't gotten that far."
2,Painful,"Despite the previous claims that there was some pain involved, I thought I could tough it out and bought it anyway. It hurts. Even with using conditioner, you can feel every little hair being pulled out. If you can get through that, it does last for about four weeks. As for me, I can't put myself through that every month or so. Shaving isn't that bad, I guess."
1,Don't bother,I have an old braun epilator that I like--my only issue is that it is old and corded. I bought this epilator on a killer sale at a local store because it was a cordless model and seemed like it would be nice. It wasn't. It hurt worse than the braun and the charge only got me through part of one leg. There is no option to use it as a corded model so I was out of luck. The part of my leg that got done did not have all the hair removed.Don't waste your money on this model.
2,eh its alright,"So the first time is definitely the most painful, and it gets easier after that. but i found that the hair doesnt stay gone for long. my legs seemed to be in a constant state of ""spikey"" even though i tried to use it at any sign of hair. it also has a small head, so even if it did work perfectly, you dont remove much hair at once. it tends to take a long long time to get every area. i've only tried it in the shower once, so maybe it works better wet than dry. but overall, i wasnt too pleased with this product. i might try to return/exchange it for a different epilator. the only way i can get my legs smooth for longer than a day is to epilate, then shave. but i think that defeats the purpose...but i suppose everyone has different hair textures and growth patterns, so what didnt work for me might just work for you. i have pretty sensitive legs and hair that grows back with the slightest chill in the air. so that could be it too.hope this helped!"
3,does what it says,"The Panasonic works ok, but not sure epilating in general is for me. It does hurt like hell the first few times, but I got through that ok, its the damn bumps or most people say ingrown hairs that are my biggest problem. It seems the machine might grap a little skin as well as hair. I will give it a little more time and see if it clears up."
2,"Cheap monitor, mediocre image quality.","I'm using one of these at home. It's definitely one of the cheaper monitors out there, but the image quality it displays can be dissapointing.More specifically, the colour.I notice different regions of the monitor showing different shades of colours when it's supposed to show one, flat colour. If you do some graphics/imaging work, stay away from this one.The previous review regarding ghost shadow was right, although I don't think that it eventually goes away: your eyes just get used to it.If you play games on this monitor with its wide-screen resolution, you'll notice that you can only play it in its default resolution (1440x900), as other wide-screen resolutions will yield you a blurred/misadjusted display.If you can spare a bit more money on a better monitor, by all means do."
2,"Fun at first, but wears out fast.","I had fun with this product for the first few days that i had it, but after spinning it enough, the bearing starts to wear out and it doesn't retain it's spin as long. The string was also fairly weak and broke after a few days of use. Not that finding another string is hard, but it was definitely annoying. If i could go back, I would probably shell out some extra cash to get a higher quality gyroscope."
3,Picture/description is somewhat deceptive,"The gyroscope works well enough (this is not the precision model), but mine did not come in the plastic box nor with the pedestal as shown in the picture and listed in the description. It came in a thin cardboard box without the pedestal, which makes it rather difficult to use -at least, to start off with; so, take it with a grain of salt. You're probably better off getting this from Thinkgeek, who actually do supply all the parts."
1,doesn't work,"It simply doesn't work. First I thought I don't spin it fast enough, but that is not the issue. I am glad I only spent 10 bucks on it."
1,Save Your Money,"I was delighted to see this product was actually manufactured in the USA and then I took a closer look. This is so poorly made that I'm now embarrassed that it has USA on it. It is poorly balanced, off center and will hardly spin for any amount of time. I wasn't expecting a high quality piece of equipment for the price but this is just plain junk. Save your money and maybe the manufacturer will finally realize that you can only sell junk for so long before you have to improve the product to some minimal standard. Vote ""No"" with your dollars."
3,Decent product but slows 1 min a day,"Decent product but, it slows by one minute a day. In today's view, that's too much. I am sure theres sth inside one can tune it. But it is not exposed to DIY. I think as a well known brand like seiko, they should have done better quality control. This could be done by software so every watch is sharp out of factory."
4,Pasture Management,"This book is very well written. If you are interested in pasture management this is a good reference. It is best if you have cattle but, lots of the information is basic to land and helpful. Very well laid out and researched."
4,"If you want small, this is it!","Pros:Size: extremely small. fits in in your palm.Feature laden interface, easy navigationPhone book from one handset can be transmitted to additional handsets without re-entering to each.Rechargable NiMH batteryCons:Proprietary batteryProprietary headset and connectorNo noise cancelling capabilityUPDATE:I am still using this system, with an additional handset (after 3 1/2+ years). I am still using the original batteries. It is an excellent 2.4GHz cordless phone."
5,great movie,"This is a great movie starring some of the best in film industry. Paul Newman plays a great rancher in the modern times selling cattle with Lee Marvin with some good comedy along the way. This movie is presented in Widescreen format and is in great quality. The only problem I had with this was with the cover artwork, which didn't fit the standard case, but was too big for a slim case; other than that, this is a must have. I would and I did recommend this."
2,SUBSTANCELESS,"Got an hour plus to waste? Watch this film. One keeps waiting for something definitive to happen, but it never does. Storyline (generous to call it that) rambles aimlessly on and on. Mercifully the movie does end, but in the same aimless manner in which the film progressed. The only redeeming grace is two very talented actors (Newman and Marvin), but even their performances are dulled by this most forgettable film............."
5,a great comedy,Some of the funniest lines ever on film. A MUST see movie.Newman and marvin have never been better.
2,"Underwhelming, Over-Hyped","Like another reviewer, I heard the author on Fresh Air (npr), and was charmed by her. I rushed out to buy the book based on her interview and also on the book's strong reviews. About 30 pages in, I realized this was not insightful literary fiction, but somewhere in the Amy Tan-Anita Shreve constellation of ""women's"" fiction. Awkwardy written, obvious plot. A real disappointment."
5,Exactly what I needed,I was skeptical if this wiring harness was going to work but it did. It's easy to wire because all cords are color coded and they also labeled them letting you know what goes to what. If your looking for a wiring harness to install an aftermarket audio system then this is the one! It was very easy to install also because I've experienced installing with other brand harnesses and although they would fit it was extremely hard to get them on.
1,Does NOT work for every model advertised!,"I was very pleased with the price of the product and the how fast the shipping was, but the product does NOT work for my 2006 KIA RIO. After wiring the harness with my new aftermarket radio power cord, I went to go hook it up in my car, just to realize the harness does not fit. I should have checked before I wired the harness, but what's irritating is I shouldn't have to. You may want to check out your factory wiring harness before buying this item. I found the right one (for my car) here..... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HU4BEI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00"
2,So-so. This is old music. Where's the contemporary?,"Alfredo Gutierrez is a Colombian oldie. I don't recognize the other artists on this CD. Where's Colombia's contemporary artists, such as ""Los Cinquenta De Joselito"", from Bogotá. Many pretty voices are heard by way of the radio in Colombia, but where are their voices found here in America? Only the most famous, most rich people's voices [Shakira, Carlos Vives, Los Trio]are heard via CD's in such stores as Best Buy, Circuit City, Amazon.Com, CD.NOW, etc. Why not expand your market?"
5,"Awesome, a must read for any middle school student.",This book is awesome! I personally didn't think I would like it but it is just like what middle school is. I am in 7th grade and this book reminds of soooo many things and incidents that happen. I recommend this book and hope you buy it because it is NOT a waste of money.
1,BOOOORING!,This book was a rehash of any light or fluffy program about gays that you'd see on E! or VH-1. I was not at all impressed by the author or the content. There are a lot more interesting and humorous books about gays out there. Save your money and time and buy one of them instead.
1,A waste of money,"We were very, very disappointed with the Serta 4-pound memory foam Queen 2-inch mattress! We were looking forward to sleeping peacefully and comfortably. The first night I could not believe how uncomfortable the mattress was! As it is supposed to be comfortable and mold into your body I thought somehow I must have got it wrong! So the next night it was even worse and I actually felt that I was sleeping on bits of wire!! We have taken it off the bed and are planning perhaps to make beds for the dogs with it! That is really all it is useful for. What a terrible waste of money and what a huge disappointment!1"
5,Exactly what I hoped it would be,"Much more comfortable sleep. No problems. We've had it for a couple of months, so I can confidently give it 5 stars."
2,Shortened American version,"The Trip - 2-DVD Set [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom]Wonderfully funny stuff - too bad this is the shortened American release that runs a hair under two hours instead of the full three hour British version (actually six half-hour episodes). You'd think the DVD would have restored the extra footage."
2,Meh,"The ""Gentleman to Bed!!!"" bit is funny, but you can watch that in five minutes on YouTube. I'm a Coogan fan, but after the first reel (he's vapid and self-involved, while Brydon is less so), you have the template for the rest of the movie. Btw, Brydon's appeal eludes me."
5,Campy fun,"How can you not love this book? It's a silly good time full of lesbians and their horses. My only complaint - too g-rated! Pseudo-pulp is always funnier with x-rated scenes, but I still got many chuckles out of this book. The title alone is worth the purchase!"
2,Way too much sodium!,When I saw the sodium content I sent it back. I was deeply disappointed because I was hoping egg protein would taste better than whey. I'll never know.
5,Great for a tasty protein boost,"I'm a many-time repeat buyer of this product. The rich chocolate variety is really good and a nice choice if you're looking for a great tasting product that will also give you the protein you need for working out. Just put one scoop into a glass of water and you're good to go. It's really easy for me to mix it up in the water just with a spoon. I don't know what some other reviewers are doing when they say its diffcult to mix. I've never once had this problem. I haven't tried any of the other flavors yet because I've been so happy with the rich chocolate, but maybe next time I'll try changing it up just to see what the others are like. If they're anything like this one, I know I'll be happy. Highly recommended."
1,Tastes Like EGG!,"and that's not cool. I blended this with strawberries and bananas. As soon as it hit my tongue, I could taste a very intense egg flavor. Not good. Then I thought I could just push past it or get used to it. Two more gulps and I was done with this stuff. I figured it would be great based on the previous reviews. Very disappointed and now have to figure out what unfortunate soul I can convince to ingest this!"
3,Not Bad,"A fairly good protein in my opinion, not the best but a good price and decent product. The salt content is very high, which some occurs naturaly but I've seen other egg protein powders with less salt.Flavor is good, not the best but ok."
3,"fake sugar, tolerable taste","you know, if companies would be forthcoming about their ingredients BEFORE i buy a product, I'd be able to make more conscientious choices. I was sold on the "" as much glutamine as 7 whole eggs in one scoop"", turned off by ascelfame potassium (sp?) sucralose... The aftertaste of all fake sugar is terrible, its oversweet and unpleasent. That being said, the taste isnt terrible, just undesirable. I'd love to find some egg protein without fake sugar, comment if you've been luckier than me in your endeavors. I'm currently stacking this with isopure unflavored zero carb instantized whey protein and will check back in after ive had about a month to see how well these are working in conjunction."
4,Delicious Egg Protein,"This is a delicious alternative to chocolate whey protein. I have a sensitivity to the whey, so I thought this would be a good alternative. I used about half of the tub when I realized it also contains soy and I have a soy allergy. I'm not sure what amount of soy this product has, but I didn't want to risk it and chose another brand of protein. But besides the whole soy thing, this is a very good tasting powder. This is a great protein to cook with, I used it to make my post-workout protein pancakes."
3,Great gift,I bought this as a gift for my mother and she really enjoys it a lot. Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen Twenty.
2,Not for young children,"I was purchasing this product for display. I work in Mortgage Lending, and needed something to promote ""Construction Loans"". I can say that I was quite disappointed in the quality of the product. There was glue on the figurines, the plastic toys were dirty, and some items were missing (I ordered 2 sets).I would definately not recommend this for a child. Some of the parts are so small, even I could choke on them.However, I gave it 2 stars because it serves the purpose for my display...and was inexpensive."
5,Good,I purchased these to replace the worn out AGX's that I had on the car. They are a very good product and I recommend these struts to anyone looking for replacement struts when lowering their vehicle.
4,pub table --good buy,This arrived on time and was exactly as described. It is good quality for the price and looks great.
4,Guitar Hero III,A fun game with the kids. I like their reactions when I know the words to the songs and they don't. HaHaHa!
1,POINTLESS!,"I bought this game for my roomate i dont know why he likes it ,it gives me a headache ,you have to you have to line up the buttons on the game in order to keep playing the music if you miss a button you screwed up and have to start all over again , and the music is loud and annoying some of the songs are nice but that's about it after a while it gets to ya ,in my opinion it's a pointless waste of money."
3,a bit pricy but okay,"Work well on the kindle, all though a little to responsive .When scrolling you will experience it opening links rather than scrolling on. THAT SAID, IT.S BETTER AND FASTER TO TYPE WITH AND MUCH MORE ACCURATE THAN BIG FINGERTIPS."
2,I did a video of this,"The quality is good enough for DV-videobut only in wide angle mode. Do not tryto zoom too much with it or you will seethe quality deteriorate very fast.The lens is very soft which is why Idon't recommend it beyond DV usage.It's very cheap, and comes with adaptorrings which could turn up to be useful too.Native: 37mm, adaptors downto 25mm. There isno thread on the lens, so no filters.[...]"
2,Studio is better....,I am a huhe fan of T'Pau and Ms. Decker...But I was dissappointed in thevocals and quality of this cd! I recommend this to die hard fans only....Buy all of Her studio cds!!!!!!!
1,Not Useful,I did not find that this product increased my wi-fi experience. I did not like it. I would not recommend this product.
4,You get what you pay for.,"This antenna was alot cheaper than most. its signal quality is about equal to my stock antenna, the best part about this antenna is the 6 foot cable, I can locate this antenna in places where I can get a better signal due to it being in a better line of sight to the AP.The magnet in the base is really strong, however it is only held in place by a sticker on the bottom, I have pulled it out at least twice now, I am going to have to glue it in somehow? This is really the only negative of this antenna."
4,Does Exactly What It Says,"I am quite pleased with this. Whereas my Linksys card gave my second-story computer two bars -- apparently inadequate for internet use -- by simply replacing the antenna I am up to 4 bars and able to stream video. Very easy, practical solution."
5,photoshop fundamentals hit it BIG with me,"Being an intermediate Photoshop'er, I found this video to be very helpful in organizing my understanding of the overall geography of Photoshop 5.0. This edition reviews a number of tools and how they can be used to manipulate an image, as well as giving a general--but very important--background to imaging terminology (did you know that ""Pixel"" is a word blend of ""Picture"" and ""Element""?...I didn't).Photoshop Fundamentals [Tape One] is appropriate for anyone planning on getting serious about the Photoshop application, web design, imaging, etc, or if you're just beginning and want a head start on getting things rolling.Have a peep: This video will do a fine job of introducing you to Photoshop. i will definitely view a few more from this series. ciao for nao."
5,FANTASTIC DEALER,The Wizard of Oz - Vintage Recordings from the 1903 Broadway MusicalFANTASTIC RECORDINGS FOR A COLLECTOR OF ANTIQUE MUSIC!!!!!
2,"Too focused on excessively successful people, and not on mid-level workers.","I read this booking looking for some practical advice on breaking through burnout in my development career. This book was OK, but focused FAR too much on very successful people such as CEO's, actors and sports stars. I had a very hard time finding any application to my own professional life."
4,very good,I have not yet read through the entire book but it explores many novel ideas. The author did a very good job in bring the text down to everyones level. There is some information that is just not necessary in the book but other than that it is very good.
4,Death of an Outsider by M C Beaton,"""Death of an Outsider"" by M C Beaton is about Scottish village constable Hamish Macbeth, who, with his dog Towser, is banished to a village away from the town of Lochdubh, to a outpost place called Cnothan, where the townsfolk aren't friendly.When a man is killed, he tries to find the killer, while a woman tries to seduce him, as his beloved Priscilla-Halburton-Smyth, is having a date with a gentleman....The book is fun, short, and enjoyable, as Hamish is thwarted by his boss, and other cops, at every turn, but in the end, he is glad that Priscilla saves him from the village, and in the end, drives him back home to Lochdubh....M C Beaton is funny, witty, and the book gets four stars.Highly recommended.Robert Helliger,Narre Warren, Melbourne, Victoria,Australia."
2,Not sure it helped,Bought this based on a recommendation of a friend of a friend. I couldn't tell if there was any benefit to taking the remedy.Probably won't buy again.
3,Helps jetlag some,This product wasn't as great as I had hoped but it did help some with my jet lag. I followed the instructions exactly but I still needed to take an afternoon nap. I might buy it again...it is definitely better than having nothing to help.
5,Da Bomb,"I don't even have to enter any comments for this CD, but:1) They are definetely in my opinion 1 of the top 3 choirs of this time. 2) This is a must have to any collection. It is sure to bless all who watch and listen. 3) The DVD was such a great idea and you will be just as blessed by either the CD or DVD. 4) The medleys of old songs brought back so many great memories and tears.It hurts to know that this is it....the FINALE. Maybe they'll comeback like JayZ or Makavelli (LOL). We can only hope and pray for Reunion concerts and recordings.Anyone who has never purchased a Tri-City album will, after this one, go out and purchase all of them. From day 1 they have been top-notch and they have only gotten better as the years passed. You will be blessed. GO AND GET YOUR BLESSING."
5,Donald Lawrence and The Tri-City Singers Grand Finale,"Wow this limited edition cd/dvd set is just wonderful I enjoyed every moment of this dvd I mean it feels as if I'm right there at the recording. ""It's Your Time"" on disc 2 is my absolute favorite man Karen Clark-Sheard ripped it ya heard me she did the echoing and everything but all in all this dvd/cd set will bless everyone who watches it thanks Tri-City singers for blessing us with good music down throught the years I encourage everyone to get this truly enjoy the blessings that will flow into your life"
3,Stories of Love,"I love John McDermott's voice but this cd just didn't do it for me. I played it once and today it rests, gathering dust, on the shelf. John can turn out a lovely ballad - he did it with ""Mona Lisa"" - but the collection on this cd made me wonder if John has lost his ability to choose songs that best showcase his voice. I'd never want to limit him to only traditional Scottish and Irish tunes, but I hope that next time he decides to depart from that genre he does a better job of picking out songs. If you want a John McDermott cd, get ""A Day to Myself"" -it's much, much better than this one."
5,Amazing!!,"I have been looking everywhere for good books to learn Korean, and this book along with the workbook are everything I've been looking for. Even though the audio is not included you can listen to it online :)I totally recommend this product for those who want to learn Korean!"
3,Not a self-study text,"A good textbook makes the complex things seem simple -- but this textbook seems to make even the simple things more complex than they need to be. The grammar explanations use too many technical terms and do not include enough examples. If you have a teacher, this text might be a good choice. If not, forget it. For a clear and concise explanation of elementary Korean grammar, I recommend the Lonely Planet Korean Phrasebook. For more determined students, I think the grammar explanations in the Yonsei University series are much clearer."
1,expecting a LOT more,"Bought this book after reading the good reviews only to find out that after the first couple of pages, there were barely any pronunciation help, no practice with trying to speak the words. One of my korean friends took a look at it and said it was such a waste of money...so disapointed"
3,Good Book with a MAJOR flaw,"This is an excellent book but has a major flaw!!!!! There are no answers for either the questions in the text or in the accompanying workbook. This is a gross oversight that should be corrected. Or at least potential buyers should know of this flaw. I am unsure if I would have purchased this book had I know of this shortcoming.If this book had the answers for the questions, I would have rated the book as a 5."
2,Poor quality of discs,I live in Colombia and this DVD does not work. I wasn't able to see the movies. the discs simply do notrun. There is a noise like a hiss and the image is frozen. What can I do? The same happened with the Mistery DVD of this collection.Please advise.Stella Duque
1,Very Disappointing,"Although it says on the back of the case ""Presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of their original theatrical exhibitions,"" these movies are panned and scanned. I expect much more from TCM."
2,A mystery why this is a mystery,I have to say this novel was a little too predictable and seemingly written in a formulaic style. You could pick out the material that was written as 'filler' meaning that it did not advance the story in any way but just seemed to help increase the word count. Tension wasn't built up well and the flow of events took too long to unfold.
4,Hard to find,"""Somebody Told A Lie"" is one of the most beautiful and romantic songs ever written in my humble opinion and I am so happy to have found it again on this compilation!"
5,Hours of Enjoyment,"Full House provides hours of enjoyment for my children, both boys and girls. Best of all, there is no bad language, sexual misconduct, drinking, drugs, disrespect, or general bad behavior of any kind. It is great for the whole family. What more can you ask for?"
5,Great ending of a fantastic series,"Trigun's last four episodes are an emotional ride. Paradise is incredible, and after that, I was shocked that Sin was even more powerful. Live Through is even better, and of course, the final showdown in Under the Sky so Blue is what everyone who watches the series was waiting for. I for one, was not disappointed. I gunfight in the last episode alone is worth the whole DVD (I must have watched that gunfight 50 times ^_^). In short, this volume is awesome, and a really cool ending to one of the best anime series ever!"
1,Amazon did not,I ordered this computer on 1/2/2007 for $100 less than the present price. I just received a notice that the shipping will be delayed from 1/16/2007 to 1/15/2008. Should I expect a 1 year delay to have the item for the original price or pay $100 extra to have it delivered within a few days? This does not seem a proper business behavior to me.
4,"Cost effective, if nothing else.","I got caught up in the television series box sets, to the point of needing one of these. I need another one now. Although a bit slow and time consuming to finish typing in the titles that the dvd player didn't recognize, still a good deal. And a great deal for the amount of dvds it holds. Enough that I now turned of my satellite dish subscription. The tiny buttons on the remote seem neccessary for the amount of things it needs to do. The folder button could be more comfortably located. Would love to find a 1000 disc dvd player now.. :D"
3,Nice KJV Bible,"This is a new Bible, fairly recently released. Even though it says it is a 'World' Bible, World was bought out by that wonder-of-wonders of cheap inferior Bible sales, Thomas Nelson.This edition that I am reviewing is bonded leather, and is dual grain, smooth and pebble grain. Not bad if the spine didn't cave in after about 3 weeks. The print is wonderful and large, with all of the archaic words defined at the end of the verse---a necessary tool if one is going to use the KJV. The annotations are at the bottom of the page, and there are in-text maps and charts. A very nice Study Bible!!!! Unfortunately, it is glue/adhesive bound, so it's not going to be long for this world---a typical Nelson Bible. But, it is worth having, for the size of the print alone, It is very easy reading---and that's what counts."
5,Some caveats,"The readers were originally seminarians. Often a critical word or phrase is rendered in Latin or Greek. You can work around that by treating the word as a symbol for an idea otherwise explicated, but sometimes in this book (less so in the prior ones) a critical eplanation or reference is entirely in Latin. The book, as is true with all of the others, is well worth the work involved in studying it. It is neither an in depth analysis of everything, nor a beginner's text. Excellent for college students and particularly philosophy students who have finished the survey courses."
3,Serves the purpose,"I suppose it does what it's supposed to do- be a sword stand. I got this for my brother, and was disappointed to see how flimsy and small the stand is. The parts seem decent quality, just on a smaller scale than I was anticipating. I guess you get what you pay for!"
5,Excellent Solution to Yeast Problems,This book is one of four that I checked out of the library to see which one was best from the standpoint of recipes that I would actually enjoy making; this one topped the list which is why I bought it. Excellent investment.
2,expected it to be better,I thought this product was just ok. I've never used a foot spa before and purchased this one based on the many good reviews. I really wasn't thrilled enough to keep it so I'm returning it (and I really wanted to love it). Below are my pros and cons.Pros: Warms up right away even with cold waterwater stays warmthe different control settings were coolinterchangeable base platesCons: big and heavythe toe touch controls requires you to have bionic toes (I had to keep using my fingers to change the setting)the pedicure attachments were awkward to use-- you have to keep the attachments depressed with your toe so it can keep rotating and that made for some awkward use (kind of amusing trying to do this actually)water jets were rather wimpyHope this review helps someone.
1,not a good product,"HiI have never left a real written feedback before. But this product needs a lot of work. Its over priced and has falts, starting with it splashes everywhere!! It also does not heat the water or maintain heat when you use hot water. If I looked harder I would have not bought this product. Buyer Beware!"
3,Water gets reallllly hot!,"For those desiring a really hot soak, well this may be your pick. Water really does get hot, I mean really hot! Water splashes a bit onto the surrounding floor. Place large towel underneath unit during soak. Overall, pretty good foot bath if you like a really hot foot soak.Misplaced my instruction guide that came with spa. Does anyone know how I can get another one?"
1,Waste Of Money,"I purchase this product to replace an older Hot Spa that I have. This product is over price & is a piece of junk. The older Hot Spa I have is superior to this model. The water gets too hot, too quick. It quickly becomes uncomfortable to have feet in. The manufacture must have change this model as the one I have is nothing like the one describe in the earlier comments. I recommend not wasting your money on this product."
2,Nothing that you can't do with a tub of hot water,"The Hot Spa Ultimate splashes a lot of water around during the heating process and while your feet are in the tub. The rolling massagers need to be worked on manually. One can get a similar tub with a shield, pour hot water in it and drop in the same type of massagers and get the same experience. And, you don't even have to waste your money on electricity."
1,Health Safety Fail!,"Of what is this unit made? Doesn't say BPA-free. So this is likely toxic. That means one would be soaking one's feet for health reasons in a toxic carcinogenic soup. Say No! Write to the manufacturer or call them and ask for full disclosure.PLEASE RESEARCH THIS YOURSELF- FOR YOUR HEALTH & SAFETY!PSRe: the models which have Microban- website doesn't disclose the specific anti-bacterial chemicals used so it's tough to determine how it works or whether it contains dangerous chemicals. Some anti-bacterial chemicals such as triclosan and triclocarban, are suspected endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors can cause hormonal abnormalities, reproductive problems, & Birth Defects!And gel inserts? Toxic!"
5,Thoroughly enjoyable.,"If you are going to the Carribbean, have been there, know someone who is going, have an interest in what Western Africa really feels, sounds and looks like, or if you just enjoy good yarns this a great book. The author obvisiously knows and loves his sea, the peoples and places he writes about. He beautifully captures all with character and respectful humor. This a good read. You will spend a lot of time with a happy smile as you try to ration the stories out to prolong the pleasure of a good read."
3,What I think,I think this system is good if you don't want to expand. But if you try to hook this in to a home entertainment center it does not work. If you only want it for a stereo it works great
3,Reading in Progress!,I like the book once in a Blue Moon. But there were some points in the book that were frustrating. Because I did not understand how a grown woman can let her sister have so much say so in who she chose to fall in love with. I think she needed to find a clue. And tell her sister to get a life!
4,Extremely well done,"I loved this book. Sensitive, honest and well written. I thought that the main characters were well sketched and honest. I would definitely read this author again. One other note, as another reviewer pointed out the cover art for this book doesn't do the book justice as it certainly doesn't match the authors descriptions of the protagnists."
2,"Good story concept, Bad leading character",I liked the story of Denise and Ian ***BUT*** the story started off way to slow. You got a lot of background about the computer world (which was ok for me because I work in IT) but the relationship between the two doesn't really start until halfway into the book.All I got from this book was a whiny black woman to unsure of her feelings to face up to her family because she has feelings for a white man. Denise let her family dictate how she should feel WAY TO MUCH. She cried a lot and couldn't seem to focus on her relationship with Ian like a mature adult. Of the two characters you will definitely like Ian and his family more.I am glad I bought the book but if I had it to do over? I would definitely buy used and cheap!
3,Yummy Ian,"Well this book was entertaining, but annoying. You'd think the authorwould have made the female main character stronger, but in the majorityof the book she was weak. She kept allowing family thoughts and opinionsto dictate whether or not she should date Ian, her White pursuer. Anyway,Ian was the only reason I continued to read this drivel. Any man who wantsa woman and pursues her with such tenacity is A-OK in my book."
2,Good but not great,"I didn't hate this book but it wasn't one of my faves. This is the story of Ian and Denise. They are computer nerds who work together on some kind of firewall program. They of course fall for each other. Denise however is unsure. She thinks her family won't be able to handle it. Ian goes after her till she agrees to go out with him. I had trouble with how long she kept Ian secret. She was a grown woman and should have had the guts to stand up to her family. If a white man did that to a sista she wouldn't be having any of it. Also she cried way to much. And never really seemed comfortable with Ian to the very end. I know she said she wanted to ""go slow"". But any slower she and Ian be ready to cash in their 401k's. Still I couldn't help but like her family. They reminded me so much of mines. Over all this is a nice light read. It's no Color of love or At last but it'll do if your looking to kill sometime."
5,A very funny book,"This book is very funny. It has a family that says very unrealistic things while they look for Hildy. Hildy is a typical 5 year old who has very STRONG emotions. My son loves this book because he understands why Hildy is hiding. My son asks me to read this book everynight and has renamed it ""Hildy""."
5,I GET GIRLS,"I'M ABOUT MEETIN GIRLS, I'M ABOUT MEETIN GUYS.I'M SCORES MAN DAMN IT.I GET GIRLS WITH MAMBO. FROM STRIPPERS TO REGULAR CHICKS.T-O-P-L-E-S-S"
3,"To the back of the room with you, Mund.","Mambo has helped me meet girls & guys, it's helped me have FUN, but it kept me from sitting in the nice chairsat Gary's during the Superbowl. Yes, I had to sit on a stool in the back with faa faa. But, it was a comfortable stool. Or was, until Rchard woke me up with those damn cymbals. T-O-P-L-E-S-S. You got a problem with that?"
2,It is okay cologne.,I bought this cologne and i feel just water in it with little smell. I might got a fake one. I just felt bad cause i had that cologne before and it was great.
3,nothing comes to mind,The cd play well untill around trax 15 and it begin to skip so unable to listen to traxs thru the end. I bought it for one song only Mom's apple pie I could not enjoy it. I return it hopefully I will get anew cd that work all the way through.
1,not received,recently purchased but have not received it yet and its going on 1 month so right now it's not a good experience..........
5,Only Oracle book that delivers and does not waste trees,"Very well done, the examples are sophisticated and lead to instant use, books by oracle press are fyi and may be good for bed time reading, but if you are programmer with a job you need to all the available help from good books like these to jumpstart ADT, PL/SQL tables. What most programmers need is a template/prototype code and that is what most of the books lack, which where the Doc succeeds. So if one is serious about Oracle this is a must have although it is intended for intermediate to advanced audience. For the newbies, once you get some traction in Oracle buy this book as it will take you to the next level"
4,Does the job,"I bought this for my son, who is in college. He says it works well and is just what he and his roommates needed to keep the carpet clean and ensure that they get their deposit back when the time comes."
4,Good source of information,"A good book with a lot of useful information. I wanted it for use in tying classical strings and minor repairs. If your relatively new to this type of stuff, you will find this a valuable reference."
5,Very Moving,"Attending a german school in 8th grade ('95), I first read this book (in it's original german) for a book rewiew and thoroughly enjoyed it. The story about a girl named Alice describes what it was like for Jews and others to travel to the concetration camps on cattle cars with the unending thirst, heat/cold, death, excrement and fear. It has a double importance for me because Mrs. Pausewang came to our area library and gave a speech on her writing. She is actually a surviving victim of the holocaust herself so she wrote this with experience. The end of the book is a really touching one as is the rest of the story. This story was one of my first favorite books. In fact, I liked it so much, I had my dad pick up a copy of it on a return trip to Germany so I would have it. Now, while doing research for my college Holocaust class I found out that it is translated into English so more people are able to read this wonderful story. Now I can finally recommend it to everyone."
3,Munchkin Teether,"Ordered this for my new Nephew. He's only 3 months old so I can't really say anything good or bad about the product as he's not used it yet. It does look like it will be a good gum soother when chilled. I hope so. I don't think it would be a waste of money, either way, as little ones put everything in their mouths and at least this is to big to choke on. I would purchase again for that reason."
1,Not as described!,This seller shipped only one teether and describes purchasing four teethers for about $5.00. I can get just one of my choice for a dollar! Not happy with the seller but amazon is requesting a refund for me and I am returning this single green foot.
3,COLD,My baby has been teething for what seems like forever! I bought this with the hopes that it would help. Most teethers are not to be frozen so I thought this would be perfect. It seems too cold for him. He cannot hold onto it too long or is hands freeze and he doesnt seems to like to chew on it. Very good quality though - my baby just didnt seem to like it.
1,No choice in the style,"You get no choice in the style and we got stuck with the foot. It is much too big and bulky for my 4 month old to use. And it would cost more to send it back, so I will probably just keep it or try to give it away. I would not purchase this item again, and I would advise you to be sure you are okay with getting the FOOT one (the least desirable design) before buying. It is very heavy."
1,Munckin Fun Ice Chewy Teether,I really thought that I was going to receive the four Munchkin Fun Ice Chewy. But get what? I was wrong I just received one and it wasn't the color that I want. I ended up paying a lot for something that I did not like it.
4,great teether - stays cold,"I purchased the ""hand"" teether and my 6 month old really enjoys it because it is cold and STAYS cold. I like it because it can be frozen (other teethers can only be refrigerated), so it is more soothing on his sore teeth/gums.I also like the hand shape as the fingers sticking out make it an interesting shape for my baby."
