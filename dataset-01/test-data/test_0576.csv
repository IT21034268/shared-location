3,Second in series of Women's Murder Club,"Still getting to know the series characters, still liking Lindsey and the whole woman in leadership thing. The setting in San Francisco is good as I know the city well."
2,This was my first audio book,"Though I enjoyed not having to turn pages and being able to just sit back and close my eyes, I did not like the voices of the narrators at all. Especially the woman. Patterson uses some coarse language which is necessary in the context of certain chapters and she sounded silly reading it. She read as if she were reading to children."
4,Great cd,"This is a great cd, for learning French by singing it. Only bad thing is the missing lyrics. Lyrics were not included, which are included in most cd's today. Other than that cd itself was fantastic!"
3,beware,"I have learned the HARD way that amazon auto parts search is dismally inacurate. I bought these struts for a 06 hyundai accent that parts search found compatible, but was not. Save yourself the grief and buy from a local autoparts store!"
3,good item wrong description though,Before you buy this cable make sure it is the one you need. I bought this for my kenwood ddx 418 and the cable didnt have the right connector for the video. On the reciever I have its a rca connector and on the cable it is a 3.5 mm connector
3,Mislead on shipping,"Am very disappointed in the shipping of this item. I ordered this item on the 22nd believing it would ship in 3-5 days , as stated.Today is the 30th and it has yet to ship. My sons 18 birthday will not be what I had hoped for ."
4,What I was looking for.,"Have used this lotion for years and it's now been discontinued by the manufactures. So, I found it on Amazon and ordered all the bottles I could get. This particular formula is great and my hands are soft and supple with it. Good buy if you can find it."
4,Dogfight,"My son-in-law enjoyed the movie. He had seen it before I bought it, so I decided to get him a copy of the movie as a gift."
1,I never got what I odrered,"I really wanted to own this movie, but the company I bought it from never sent it to me. All I saw was an email that I was getting my money refunded to me, other than that there was no explanition."
4,"A typical Greeley story, but nonetheless, a good read","""Patience of a Saint"" is a typical Greeley story. It contains some excellent images and metaphors of the Catholic Church, some good mystery, some sex, and some violence. It fits Greeley's perfect equation of what to include in a sell-able story. But even with all the expected story parts, it remains one of his better stories, delving into a person's growth as an adult. It is reminiscent of the Biblical story of Saint Paul's conversion, set in modern-day Chicago, with some contemporary images thrown together to show us what Paul may have gone through if he had lived in our time. An interesting idea, a good read, and if you take the time, a thought-provoking way to approach the Bible story as well as middle age."
4,"Good for choosing a career, but not a job","This book is a great place to look if you don't know what to do in real estate. However, to actually find a job that fits your career choice requires other things like the information I was able to find at Vaultreports.com"
3,"Interesting premise, but doesn't really hold together","An interesting premise, but ultimately, although the technology is very cool and reasonably accurate, it doesn't hold very well together from a character development PO"
5,Great Video,"This DVD on the Blue Train was really great. The narration was great, it gave a feeling of what it is like to travel on the train, and it also showed some behind the scenes footage of the Blue Train being cleaned and prepared for its next journey. The video also included some footage of some beautiful South African towns and Cities including Pretoria and Cape Town."
2,"Of dubious quality, with faulty sectors","It's always hard to judge product quality from anecdotal evidence, but I purchased one of these in mid 2006. On using it, my camera crashed pretty often, eventually being unable to finish booting at all with the card installed -- a problem it had never exhibited with other CF cards. Eventually I fed it to a PC and ran a badblocks scan on the thing, which turned up several dozen bad blocks, some of them in the regions generally used for metadata on the FAT filesystem most cameras use.That's potentially a serious issue, because while all modern filesystems can be given lists of bad blocks to avoid, rendering partially faulty media usable, digital cameras and other embedded devices often use partial implementations of filesystem standards and may not honor bad block lists."
2,Nad's sangria punch warm gel,"It got here just in time! But the package seemed to be as if this itemhad been sitting on a shelf for years. I Bought 2, and both were the same. It even had sugar crystals from the honey in contains. But after all that I was able to somehow manage to use it and it worked perfectly fine!! Oh btw this says warm, meening that u place it in your microwave to use it :0/"
4,"interesting read, not a bad price","The trilogy isn't bad, it built up well in the first two books, but in the third book it slowly went down. The last book ending is a bit surprising, but doesn't end well. Other than that, the first two books are awesome. 12 dollars for these books is worth it, even though the third book isn't as great."
2,Guess I'm back to Cherry Chapstick,"If I was Miley Cyrus or even Hannah Montana for that matter, this would be my lip gloss. It's too teenybopish/ out in the clubs color and shine that you need sunglasses to look in the mirror. As a mature woman who is an RN this is not the look I'm trying to achieve. The Bare E. lip products I have been repeatedly disappointed with as the regular BD lipsticks had tons of staying power, but are far too drying. This said, I'm a cheerleader for the rest of their makeup line. Guess I will return to my Cherry Chapstick for now. Sigh..."
4,love it!!,"this color is beautiful..it's shimmery without it looking like it should only be worn ""after-hours""...i would have preferred a thistle brush applicator because it would be easier to apply..the formula seems a little thick and i thought it would leave my lips sticky, but instead the shimmer and color stayed on very well throughout the day...does it result in bigger lips? well, it certainly feels like it is hydrating your lips throughout the day. Even though i did not see an obvious difference in my lips' size, i love it and will be buying more of it!!"
1,Bad Work At It's Best,"Can Greenfield ever get his ""scholarship"" right? When will he stop simply adding worthless footnotes and trivial minutia to the occult research pool and get down to some serious work? If you can find a free copy on-line, down-load and skip this piece of garbage-- nothing new here."
2,Would not purchase again,"As soon as I received this item, I tested it. To test probiotics, you break open a few capsules and add them to about 1/2 cup of milk. Left on the counter for a few hours, if the cultures are live it will thicken and begin to look more like yogurt. This did not. It is not refrigerated by Vitacost, I later learned, and so i returned it, a process which took more then 2 weeks (the delivery service they sent to pick up the box did not come until I had called 3 times). I have since purchased a similar product from a local health food store, where it was kept in a chilled case. This alternate product was alive, and turned my milk into a yogurt-like consistency within 1 hour. I can't say that the product is faulty, only that I would not recommend ordering from Amazon or Vitacost, since no care is taken to ensure the life of the product."
5,Has helped my Chrohn's disease symptoms,I have been taking these 6 weeks now and I no longer have gas or diahreah.That tells me its really working. I have had Chrohn's for 10 years now.
4,just what I needed,"I ordered this book for my graduate Environmental Law and Policy class. I didn't know what text I needed until the first day of class and was worried I would get behind but my book arrived within two days of ordering. It was listed as 'like new' and with the exception of some light highlighting in the first couple of chapters, that was correct. I would recommend ordering this vendor, they're honest and prompt."
4,Creative guitar playing,"I was introduced to Nels Cline by his playing on Mike Watt's ""Contemplating the Engine Room"". I picked ""Giant Pin"" up unheard, and was immediately pleased, though not getting it in places. I've gotten some of the more spacey/ambient songs since then. Since that's still not my cup of brew, the album loses a star from me.Otherwise, the rest is excellent. The opener is a classic jazz-guitar piece, and that's it for classic jazz guitar. Some of the songs are rock-oriented, some are free-jazz-oriented, and then there's the spacey songs.If you're interested in good, off-the-wall guitar (the bass & drums which round out the trio are very good too), this is a good one to pick up."
2,Works -- but,Purchased this item 10 months ago. Has nice packaging. All the rest is mediocre at best. Sound output level is unstable and generally low. A lot of distortion. Wireless signal is weak. And after 8 months in service the unit stopped functioning.
4,BLAZE OF GLORY,"I knew laura before she was killed. she was indeed fueled by an inner fire that she cleverly reveals in her journal. she liked croquet. laura wondered aloud how she met these people. she was drawn to uncertainty and gamble. laura had no anchor. her parents were so wrapped up in their own gig, they had precious little time for laura. she went from softball to hardball and back faster then most people can change their clothes. I pray for whats left of her soul every night."
1,"well, now, here's another","one of those books that, if you need it, you need a lot more than this book; and if you don't, why bother? I purchased the book in expectation of enlightenment about the ins and outs of professional play, preparation, perhaps an itinerary: I received well, too well, traveled pathways and worn information. I sent the book back. You will probably send the book back, too, if you have any of a half dozen titles on your shelves. I give it 1 star because the other reviewers (perhaps the author in disguise? or his family?) gave it 5. Had they been more honest, I may have given it 2. I would not have given it 2 after sitting down to evaluate it, but in retrospect that may have been emotional reaction.Thumbs down. Look elsewhere."
2,Difficult reading. Proceed with caution.,"A must read for the serious Kerouac fan, Pomes is a ""Why bother?"" for everyone else. Ann Charters wrote ""The quality most pure in Kerouac was his grasp that life is really a dream."" Nowhere is this more evident than in the random jottings that has been published as Pomes All Sizes. There are some gems among his silly little haikus, and I truly enjoyed the first sequence of ""Poems of the Buddhas of Old."" Most of the collection left me scratching my head. Was Jack just having a bit of fun with us, or was he so advanced that I still can not grasp the meaning? ""Life is like a dream. / You only believe it's real / Cause you're born a sucker / For that kind of deal;"" In Pomes All Sizes the roses are beautiful, but the path to them is unpassable to all but the most devout."
2,myths,"I really found this book kind of boring. I just don't understand how anybody could believe in such fairly tales that are obviously untrue and non-existent. I does however, show how some ancient cultures may have believed in such myths but anybody who believes in this stuff now is in serious deception. These myths are truly of the devil himself."
3,Troy -Bilt Customer Service VERY NEGATIVE,"When I received the Troy-Bilt Mulchinator, the first thing I noted was the box had been opened and not even re-taped shut. After removing all items, I noticed the mulching bag was not the same bag advertised and pictured. After over one hour on the phone with Troy-Bilt Customer Service, and three transfers, of which the first two individuals I spoke with were VERY NEGATIVE, rude, with poor attitudes, I finally spoke with an individual who, although still somewhat abrupt, at least spoke intelligently, and advised me the bag pictured is no longer manufactured for this unit and the much smaller bag that I received is reportedly now the correct bag. An additional bag is supposedly being shipped so I can change out the bags considering they are much smaller than the one pictured. Still disappointed as I did not receive what was advertised or pictured."
1,"If I could give it no stars, I would.","I just used this blower for the first (and last) time. After 20 minutes, the motor burst into flames.One of the features I look for in outdoor equipment is not-bursting-into-flames. So it'd be fair to say that I'm a little disappointed."
1,OK for blowing but vacuum bag is junk,"Good at blowing leaves but don't try to vacuum. The bag is cheap and flimsy. It's hard to remove and ripped the first year. I was able to hold it together with tape, but the entire thing disintegrated the next year. Don't waste your money on this brand."
1,I love Amazon - but this product should not be bought,"I bought two of these from Amazon. Thank god for AMZN, their service is beyond comparison. If you want a unit that shoots out flames and noxious smoke from the unit - this one is for you. Good luck."
2,not well made,The pieces broke off in less than 24 hours!!! Nice appearance but too flimsy!!! Frustrating!!!
2,Great Concepts But Not Durable,"We brought this set from the zoo and had a great expectation since it teaches different kind of animals from all over the world. My daughter loves it very much. However, we are very disappointed because the parts start falling off as soon as we open the box."
3,This brand was not for me.,"This was a good, solid product, and I can understand why people rely on it. However, it seems a matter of personal choice. I found it to be a bit too grainy, it didn't dissolve fully no matter what I did (though it mixed better in milk), and the flavor was a bit too sweet and slightly gamey, with or without milk. I infinitely prefer EAS."
3,The Brainchildren of Michael Bivins,"It would be easy to dismiss ABC as a novelty act, but they actually had some pretty tight production and some decent lyrics (courtesy of their mentors Dallas Austin and Michael Bivins). Not to mention the fact that the boys could sing! The kids shine on new jack swing/bubblegum pop cuts, like ""Iesha"" and ""Playground"", but fail to convince when they attempt to sound ""tough"" on some of their other songs like ""Little Soldiers"". If you take it for what it is (an album for kids and by kids) and don't hold it up against adult new jack swing acts from the same era, it's actually a fairly solid album."
4,Bunny LOVED it... at first.,"My rabbit went NUTS for this at first and would play with it whenever it was put near him. (I also loved watching him play with it!) Mostly he was just eating the hay and waving it around in the air, but he seemed to be getting a huge kick out of it. Lately he's not quite so into it, but if I rough it up and get some of the hay to stick out he'll mess with it a bit, just not as much as when he first got it. He is terribly spoiled, though, and with so many toys it's a bit difficult to keep his attention. :)"
4,Bunnies really seemed to like it,"They enjoyed tossing and playing with it, 4 stars because they seemed to get a little bored with it after a few days."
3,Bunny ignores it,"Considering all the other great reviews, I was really surprised when our bunny showed zero interest in this ball! He loves to chew up cardboard and paper, and loves to ""mate"" with anything that has a remotely rounded shape, so I figured he'd be into this toy. It's been months, but he consistently ignores it, whether it's in his cage or placed outside when he emerges for playtime."
3,Hollow Ball,"I have purchased this same ball before and was pleased. However, this time the ball is basically hollow in the center. It is also smaller in size than others I have purchased from the same manufacturer."
1,Not a great workout,"I bought the Gazelle a little over a year ago as a space-saving and cheaper alternative to an elliptical machine. I'm 30 years old, not always the best about working out but also not horribly out of shape, and I thought this would be an easy way to get a quick workout at home. Unfortunately, I find it really hard to work up on a sweat on this machine or get my heart rate up, and the harder I try, the more the Gazelle starts moving across my living room with me on it. It also doesn't fold up small enough to fit under my couch or bed, which is a disappointment. I wish I had just waited and saved up for a real exercise machine. In the meantime, I'm sticking to my aerobics DVDs for my home workouts and using this as a clothes drying rack. I think this would be a better purchase for someone who really doesn't exercise much and has bad knees."
1,Skip this,"I so wanted this to work. I was looking forward to a low impact full body work out. What I got was a large machine that after no more than a week was so noisy I had to turn the tv up incredably loudly. All in all, this was loud, not very stable, and didn't do anything that walking can't do."
2,Not worth any amount of money or space,"I was lucky enough to use this over a period of a few weeks while at my mother's house. It does not provide an aerobic workout compared to a treadmill or an elliptical. There is very little resistance. It is squeeky. The movements are jerky compared to an elliptical. It take sup a lot of space. I found no value to it since it didn't get my heart rate up, it wasn't working any muscles, and it didn't provide a core work out. Not sure what the purpose would be. I am not a very aerobically fit person and can easily work up a sweat on other equipment within a few minutes so not getting an aerobic workout here really says a lot. So, I don't even think that this is a good machine for beginners.On the positive side, all of the grandchildren love to swing on it and play on it. (that probably isn't a positive for my mother though). The kids think it is fun."
3,gazelle freestyle,"About 8 years ago I bought a Tony Little Gazelle Freestyle after seeing an infomercial. I figured I would use it for one month for $14.95 and then return it for my money. Well, it weighed about 75 pounds and would have cost a fortune to return it. But, as it turned out, I loved it. It was effortless and the inches and pounds came off in a hurry. When one of the cables broke recently, I decided to buy a new one, so I ordered this Gazelle Freestyle off the internet. It is not a Tony Little, as I thought. It is smaller and less sturdy. One of the plastic pedals broke while I was putting the thing together. It still works, but the quality is not as good. Unfortunately it is still to heavy to mail back for a refund. I doubt it will last as long as the original Tony Little Gazelle did."
4,great gazelle!,"I just got my gazelle set up and used it for the first time. Set up was a little iffy...definitely read all through the instructions before you begin. Use is very simple! Mine came with the DVD, and since I don't have a player, am not able to use that. However, the instructions in the owner's manual for the different moves are easy to understand. I inherited 'faulty knees', so was anxious to see how ""low-impact"" this would really be. It's great!"
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"Dr. Dodman's book, ""The Cat Who Cried for Help"" is incrediably insightful and informative in an easy to read format. It is apparant that he has an exceptional understanding of feline behaviour and that he truly cares for the well being of cat and owner. His explaination of prescriptions used in behavior modification gave me the confidence to move forward this with method of treatment. When you have a problem with a cat you love and when parting with that cat is absolutely not an option, Dr. Dodman comes in with welcome, practical and sound advice. Anyone who loves cats will appreciate and benefit by reading this book."
4,Oh so cute!,"I bought a new car, and ran across these decals in my search for tribal accents for it. I bought 2 and put them in angular positions on my bumper and they are so cute!! They are a durable quality, but you must be careful pulling off paper backing. They were die cut almost all the way around the butterfly. but where they weren't they needed to be trimmed. All and all, good buy!"
5,Historical Fiction that entertains while educating,I read this book while on vacation. It is a wonderful book on the role of the Georgia colony in the colonization competition between Spain and England. I loved it because it gave an insight into the man of James Oglethorpe.
4,The Electric Vehicle...Is It Here To Stay?,"Although this movie is hardly the entire story of the electric vehicle, it is the story of the return of the electric vehicle and some of the challenges that have been uncovered in the making of an electric vehicle that is both economical and appealing to consumers.The movie covers the story of Tesla and the problems they encountered, as well as the work done by GM to bring an electric back and finally, the work by Nissan to unveil a vehicle that was affordable to the masses. All of the companies had problems, which were highlighted, but they all also had their successes.An interesting and worthwhile movie."
3,"Great sound, poor material","Although these headphones do not provide any noise cancelling, they still provide great sound with its over the ear design. They are extremely light and made a good pair of travelling headphones. A pair KOSS high end headphones may provide a comparable quality but surpasses anything on the basic rack. Unfortunately I fell victim to its weak headband after 3 months and it seems like a number of others folks have had the same problem. The joint above the ear cup folded out as I was taking them off. No violent actions, just removed them like I always did. I was using them more than an average person (+9hrs a day) since I was deployed and my job allowed music. I listened to a variety of music and not once did the sound quality fade. I did have to constantly shift or remove them throughout the day which may have created a large amount of stress. Even though I was using them a lot I still do not feel that a 100+ dollar pair of earphones should have that flaw."
3,Mostly OK,"I have always felt that Bose products are over rated in general. These headphones fit that description perfectly. They sound ok, but there are better products in the same price range. The cord is also pretty weak and I expect it to brake any day now. That results in me using them less than I would prefer. I reach for my Sony MDR V-700's most of the time. The Bose are WAY more comfortable though. In fact, that is their best quality. Overall they are ok, but definitely check out the competition frist. Sony, Sennhieser and the like have Bose beat!"
1,Great sound but terrible construction quality,I've had a couple of these over the years since I like the sound quality. Both have fallen apart after a year of regular but careful usage. The tiny wires fatigue and break and the foam disintegrates.I'll never buy Bose again.
1,Flimsy despite the high price tag.,"These are expensive, and while the sound is good, they only last a few months of normal wear before the frame begins to break and the plastic on the headphones begins to wear off of them. At one time Bose was very good with a 'no questions asked return policy'. Like so many successful businesses, they have begun to move away from the kind of customer service that would justify their high prices. These just aren't worth the price with other lower cost options available. Bose, treat us like royalty when we pay a 'King's Ransom' for your products. Bose seems unwilling to upgrade their product design or to back up the quality of their products. My review is on of many that explains this same issue. Pay Attention Bose and go back to true 'customer service'!"
3,You can get better for same price,"I got this headphones about six months ago and thought they were amazing. However they are somewhat fragile and portability became a problem. They don't fold up. I first went with headphones for greater bass response and comfortability. ( These are REALLY comfortable.) So to get better portability, I had to go with earphones. I did some research and found the Monster Turbines for $150. I thought I would get these to travel with but not to totally replace buy Bose. However the Turbines are much much better in sound quality and sound isolation. Bass is nice and all pitches are heard with clarity and nothing is overpowering. In comparison, these Bose have no bass. The Turbines isolate you very well. Beyond what I could imagine. I'm not convincing you to buy the Turbines (although they are awsome) but to look around because you can get much better headphones for around the same price."
4,4 years,"I have had these headphones for 4 years. I have loved them since the moment I opened the package.Pros:Good all-around soundComfortable on the earsStill in good condition after all these yearsCons:Does not block outside noises as well as I would likeFraying on the wires (but the headphones still work, I just taped the fraying parts)Hard to carry around easily (I'm always worried I'll crush them)These are good headphones to buy for a good long-term investment. I would definitely recommend these to a anyone. I still love these headphones, and I know you will too."
4,One of the most underrated bands of the decade.,"I had a few ""Dukes of Windsor"" songs on my ipod and couldn't figure out where they came from. I almost took them off, but decided to give the band a chance- boy am I glad I did!Dukes of Windsor has fresh, original, hypnotic music that demands your attention, collects you off your feet, and brings you to their world. Singer Jack Weaving has a haunting and beautiful voice that rises and falls with mood of the music. Oscar Dawson (guitar) and Joseph Franklin (base) set a pitch-perfect pace, and Scott Targett on keyboard divdes the band from the normal. This band is ready to come into the spotlight."
1,"This is a terrible, extremely low budget show","I watched the first episode of this show on Nick this weekend, and it was a flat-out embarrassment. The show looks like a homemade web cartoon...and honestly, that's an insult to some homemade web cartoons. The fact that a major Hollywood summer blockbuster is backed by an animated series that is this poor is just a shame.I find it hard to believe that anyone could give this series a 5 star review. I'm sure there are some others who will enjoy it more than I did, but 5 stars is just out of the question with something this poorly done."
3,Engaging but not too useful,"although this book is quite entertaining, and she quite accurately describes pilers like myself, her approach is too 'dumbed-down'. She kept me laughing as she described situations which could have easily happened in my own home, but gave little actual information I felt I could use."
3,not very strong,"I bought cheap and got cheap.Found a few nails, one penny, and a pipe in the ground.If I dont get a flat, will save me half the cost of the item."
2,Beeped randomly. Fun for about 2 minutes.,Not worth the money. Didn't seem to know the difference between plastic and metal.
3,Lost interest in metal detector,"I bought this metal detector for my son. We tested it on coins indoors & it worked great. We brought it outside & my son got disappointed quite quickly when he couldn't find anything. He used it a couple of times with friends, but found nothing. He hasn't used it in a year."
1,this is only a toy,"I foolishly bought this detector. It would not detect a penny on top of carpet. It beeps if you sweep it side to side. It was missing an ajdustment nut on the foot. cheaply made and don't work. shipped it back, and still waiting on my money to be reimbursed. the only reason I gave it one star is because you must give at least one to post."
1,Too Sensitive,Not impressive aqnd my daughter who is 9yrs old waiting for months to get a metal detector and used it 3 times and never again much too sensitive and a big upset.
1,Wasted money,Nice gift if you want your kid to pretend to use a metal detector. This thing doesn't work at all.
3,Microsoft Works 8,"I like MS software but a couple of things about this one annoyed me. Inside the case are the instructions ""To install Works, close all programs and place the disc in your CD drive. You have two installation options."" The first sentence is correct but the second is totally false. There are no installation options, no license agreement, and no product key as is usually found on MS software. And nowhere in the instructions does it say this. This is nice software for a home office but very vague instructions."
1,Purchase of MSWORKS 8.5,I installed the Microsoft works 8.5 in my computer and it does not operate.I cannot start up the program!I would like to return the disk and receive a refund because it does not run on my computer.
2,microsoft works.....NOT,"I was disappointed when I tried to use microsoft works to create an invitation to a special dinner, I believe the inflexibility of the software was to blame. Chalk it up to experience!!Microsoft WORKS 8.0 WIN32 ENGLISH 3PK ( 070-02557 )"
3,Spring mechanism needs work,"I ordered this feeder for 2 reasons. One was to keep squirrels out of my very expensive sunflower seed, the other to keep the large flock of blackbirds from taking over the feeders & keeping the smaller, less aggressive birds away. It works well for the squirrels. I haven't had any luck adjusting it for use by smaller birds. If a squirrel or large bird lands on it, the lid will close, but the spring doesn't work well enough to open up again. I think it would work better if it had a spring on both sides instead of just one. Other than that, it is well made, nice heavy metal & has a large hopper to hold lots of food."
2,feeder is great but company had some hiccups in shipping,"The feeder is well made and does seem to put off the squirrels. The deer will still get your seed so don't buy this if you want to stop deer. The only problem was that the company sending the product shipped it without any hardware. It took 2 emails and then a phone call to resolve the issue. When I finally got a live person at the ""manufacturer HOMESTEAD"" who I was asked to contact to get the hardware, it was another store and not the manufacturer. So after another email and call to ACE, the kind rep stated we could send the entire feeder back and then they would send a replacement. Instead, they offered a second option: they would refund the shipping of $6.98 and we would go to a hardware store ourselves to buy the stuff to hang it up. It wasn't easy but resolution was made. It was the best deal on the internet financially."
5,works well,really needed this test jar. We were using a pitcher to test our sg but this test jar makes it easier.
5,a great book for both the beginner and the professional,this is a really great book with many ideas about the ways to treat discus fish and their diseases it is useful n case of any other soft water fish a famous japanese koi hatchery uses it for reference too. it saved many of my fish and saved me alot of money too.A MUST HAVE book it is now out of stock but i got a promise from the publisher to have it republished soon.
2,Huge Disappointment from First Aid Step 1!,"I agree with the other reviewers. Does not hold a candle to the Step 1 book. Even though this is Step 2, I would advise using some of the new Step 3 review books. In particular you might wish to check out a new review book that was recently written for the Step 3: Strong Med Step 3."
4,I liked it,"Despite hearing a lot of people's disappointment with this after using First Aid for Step 1, I was wondering what I should use. I decided to use this book anyway, and I'm glad I did. I felt it covered most areas well and used it in conjunction with Boards and Wards, which I had used during clerkships and made notes in. Board and Wards filled in the gaps and vice versa. These along with doing tons of questions (USMLEWORLD rocked!!- I bought Kaplan Q bank too, but that was a waste). I was able to increase my Step 2 by 40 points from my step 1!"
3,Decent book but not at all what I was looking for,I needed a book on New York that would identify good restaruants to take kids before the theatre and so forth. This book gives chain restaurants (think Chilis) as suggestions to take kids.....New York City and I am going to a chain? I think not!! We didn't utilize this book.
2,Too old,I was annoyed with myself when I received this book - it was published in 1998! We haven't gone to New York yet but I suspect there is a lot more to do these days. Silly me.
1,Powerful but Falling Apart,"This drill replaced a 3/8"" Skil corded drill due to the varible control was not as sensitive as I needed.The Hitachi D10VH had a fantastic and sensitive varible speed control but soon the drill began to fall apart.First it was the varible speed control wheel that would not stay in the setting. The detent wheel broke. Sent it back under warranty and it took almost three months to get it back.Then the three chuck fingers began to not keep the bits centered. It became not worth using it. I certainly did not want to wait another three months turn around so I bought a new Skil corded 6.5 amp drill as I have had very good service out of them. (Should have done that first but wanted to try the cheapy Hitachi)"
4,Very helpful,"After suffering with the pain of planter faciitis for many months, I purchased these along with the Futuro Night Splint. These do help ease the pain in the heel. I think the night splint helps more signifigantly, however. I purchased these approx. 7 weeks ago. I'm still using the night splint, but quit using these after about 3 weeks. But I found they do help somewhat. My pain has abated a good amount from using the splint, so that is why I quit using these. But if your pain is still acute, these do help."
4,Cheaper than some...,"Definitely a pricey product, but it seems to be comparable or cheaper than the usual ""designer"" sink. The depth and size are much more functional than two basins that are of similar size. It has nice sound insulation and is a thicker gauge than the cheapy 100-200 dollar sinks."
1,NOT the NT65MA2 as Shown / described!,"WHAT I ORDERED: Hitachi *****MA2 15G FINISH NAILGUNI specifically ordered the product from the retailer ""Damlow Prices"" because they advertized the older model NT65MA2 Hitachi nail gun. I specifically wanted the older version, as it appeared to get better reviews online from contractors and users than the NT65MA4 that replaced it. The older version is no longer in production and it appeared this site was selling new old stock (at a premium price of $281 shipped for the consideration of getting one of the better, now obsolete, models).WHAT I GOT: Hitachi *****MA4 15G FINISH NAILGUNI got exactly the gun I didnt want and was trying to avoid to get the older version. And for that, I paid an extra $145.THIS SELLER DOES NOT! SHIP YOU THE MA2 GUN.Please be aware of this so you don't make the same expensive mistake I did. It appears you can get the MA4 gun on Amazon prime right now for about $136 - so dont pay 2 times that price like (stupid) me.Now, the returning...."
5,Photoshop CS3,This was exactly what i wanted. It says its an upgrade but its a full extended version + it came with a tutorial dvd. Seller shipped it in a very timely fashion. I would order again.
3,Another huge and pretty cast,"Okay, so I'm usually a fan of these movies with the huge famous cast with interlocking stories, and this one came from the book of the same same. Most of the characters are shallow or completely annoying or both. The one couple that remains genuine is Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck. They are broken up for the majority of the film, and no one, including the actors played by Aniston and Affleck, are quite sure why. As is usually the case in these movies, the plots are predictable. All of the endings are not happy, but I will say they are at least satisfying. Worth a look if you're a fan of romantic comedy."
2,NOT a Romantic Comedy!,"Okay, I'm a girl. I like chick flicks. This is NOT a chick flick because you are frustrated, annoyed, & generally pissed off at how stupid, whiny, clingy, delusional, neurotic, etc all the female leads are (except Jennifer Aniston's character, which was thankfully wonderful). Are there women out there that DO these things?! If you are a man, you might have no problem with this movie because Hey, it portrays women pretty accurately, right? If you are a woman (okay, a strong, intelligent, liberated woman) you will NOT like this movie overall. Yes, there are cute performances but the script made for some serious ""what the f***"" moments. Just be forewarned...this is not a romantic comedy so do not expect one."
3,The title says it all. Good acting and predictable story. Mildly amusing.,"This silly chick flick was on my cable TV channel and there was nothing else to watch. Simply put, the title, which is the name of a self-help book, says it all. This is a pleasant film that is not supposed to be great. It's just a simple story with a star studded cast and a plot that includes several romances. Acting is good, the story moves fast and it's a pleasure to see such stars as Jennifer Anniston, Ben Affleck, Scarlet Johanson, Jennifer Connoly and Ginnifer Goodwin (of ""Big Love"") going through the ups and downs of trying to find love.There is nothing special about this film. It is as predictable as I expected it to be. But sometimes it's not a bad thing to just relax and let myself be amused, especially if its on TV and it didn't cost me anything. I therefore give it a very lukewarm recommendation."
2,Just not that funny,"First, this movie does a great job of displaying the hard truth about how desperate women are, and that sometimes a guy just isn't interested. That might be hard for some to swallow, but some people need to learn that. The movie has an all-star cast, but only a few deliver. I thought that Jennifer Aniston and the guy from the Mac commercials did a good job. However, this movie was just not funny at all. And they could really make a funny movie out of this topic. It was a big missed oppourtunity. I did not smile, laugh or chuckle at all during the entire movie. Also, it was WAY too long. It felt very dragged out and I had to force myself to watch the whole thing. I can't see how this a romantic comedy. It was more of a drama. Overall this movie was boring and wasn't funny at all. I was dissapointed and would not reccomend it. It displays women horribly. And did I mention it was boring?"
2,Cool title - boring movie,Don't get fooled by this movie's cool title. It is truly incredibly boring. Go talk to your neighbor instead.
3,He's Just Not That Into You,"I viewed the movie and was disturbed by how dumb the women were portrayed. I am hoping that the majority of women do not act and react as the women in the movie. However, I know there are some immature women. I just don't want to believe that most of them are. I am not an objective viewer of this movie because I don't enjoy anything that make women look less than intelligent."
3,He's Just Not That Into... Extras?,"I would have loved if this DVD came in some kind of spectacular limited edition cover or with an extra disc perhaps. But no, all you'll get here is the movie itself (both widescreen and box sizes available, which is good) and a couple extras like deleted scenes.The movie itself is impressive, funny, entertaining, true-to-life and touching so that's a plus and is a good enough reason to buy this DVD! I was just a little let down with the lack of extras.1/10 for Extras.9/10 for the movie itself."
4,"a better romantic comedy, that's hardly romantic, but is a lot more hopeful than the book its based on","I saw the movie after watching the Sex and the City episode of the same title 9for the 21546th time), from where the idea for the book came from and later the idea for the movie.""He Is Just Not That Into You"" is a more realistic romantic comedy - not every character gets a happy Hollywood ending, but they all grow in the span of their relationships. The movie is a lot more hopeful than the book it was loosely adapted from.The cast is superb, particularly Ginnifer Goodwin as a girl who just can't seem to find love, but is desperately looking for it with every guy she meets.The opening sequence of the movie is worth the price of the film alone - it speaks to the core of what causes the misunderstandings and misgivings that girls have about relationships."
5,Fantastic Movie!!,I loved this movie the cast was amazing it was funny and all around a great time!!
2,Not my cup of tea,"Sorry Folks, this was not my thing. The characters were just too quirky for me. Perhaps there are situations like these, however, I could not connect."
2,Stupid Movie,That's two hours I'll never get back. Guess I'm just to old to understand the hype. It was shipped quickly and packed well. :)
1,A sad empty movie about sad empty people,"I was persuaded to watch this movie by someone who claimed it would help me to understand contemporary American culture. I fervently hope this is not the case. I couldn't find a single point of interest - the dialog/script is flat, the characters can't even aspire to being two-dimensional, and the intellectual content is preceded by a minus sign. It's just boring, dull, unimportant and a waste of whatever it cost to make and market. Worth making a detour to avoid."
3,Looking for Sean Bean......Keep looking,"First of all, it's really hard to get past Steve Guttenberg being a ""tough"" guy. He does a good job trying. I guess I just kept expecting him to put on his big smile and crack a joke. As for Sean Bean, the reason why I bought the DVD, he pops in occassionally to shoot at whomever. Not nearly enough of him for me. There is a little twist, if you can't guess it by 1/3 of the way through. I guess overall, it's an okay movie. But, if it's Sean Bean that you're looking for, keep looking."
2,Led astray by Sean Bean,"I really hated this film. I really should known have better. When I ordered it, I thought it will probably be bad. So it was my fault. I would have rented but it is so bad it doesn't seem to be available for rental in Minneapolis. The only reason I wanted to see it is that I am a devoted fan of Sean Bean. There is entirely too little of him in the film. The screenplay seems not so much to have been written as to have happened. Steve Guttenberg's performance is so strange that either he had indigestion through the entire time the film was shot or the director is out to get him. I suspect the later. Steve Guttenberg is a pretty good actor usually, but he is woefully miscast is this truly poor film. It wasn't even funny as some really bad films are."
1,I wish I could rate this lower than 1 star...,"I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least LIKE this movie. Also, I'm Canadian and this is a mostly-Canadian movie so I was prepared to cut it some serious slack. Nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is ""Airborne"". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The acting throughout the movie was so bad I am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. I now have only two wishes in my life.1. I hope that you never have to sit through this movie.2. I wish I could get those 6 hours back. Oh wait, the movie's under 2 hours - it only seemed like 6 hours...Don't watch this."
1,Even if the Demo Works on your system the program may not,Ignore the stated requirements. Ignore the fact that the demo runs fine on your computer. The program will not run if you have and intel chipset on the VC or MB. That's the story from Enlight tech support. So save your money and buy Virtual Sailor on line.
3,Could be better...,"Me and my 2 year old daughter fell in love with this bed when we first seen it! It is very attractive and looks great. However, the three wood planks that are used to support the mattress is not even reliable. at any given moment they will give out and have to constantly be put back in place! Not to mention while assembling it, the left side upper screw had to literally be FORCED into its hole... This bed is not worth $300. It is more for show and appealing to children. I think that it should have come with better support..."
5,great bed.,this bed is really great. The only problem I have had is that the screws won't go in. Little Tikes and I have been going at it for over a month now. My 2 yearold loves this bed. You have to put pillows in the sides to account for the 6 inch gap between the bed and the car.
2,Extremely Frustrating Assembly,"For the price, I was quite disappointed with the bed we received. The hardware did not properly attach the bed sides to the ends, beasue the bolt holes had been installed incorrectly. The decorative wheels are flimsy, and with a good pull will come off and are not reattachable. The photo gave me the impression that the car would be made from smooth material and resemble a ""real"" car, but instead it is constructed of the ""pebbled"" plastic common to most Little Tikes outdoor toys. But my son has seen it, and I am not willing to send it back - I've had enough aggravation for one day! But you, dear reader -- If you are shopping for a bed for your little boy, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Great Product!,"My son is 15 months old and I bought this for our elevated terrace. The railing is very old as our home was built in the 20s and the spaces in between the bars are far apart (not to code). This product was very easy to install and didn't obstruct our gorgeous panoramic views. Now my son can enjoy hanging out on the terrace with us. One thing to note is that the edges can be a bit shape when cut for sizing. Also, not sure how long it will hold up, but I am happy with my purchase for now."
2,Deck Guard for Cat,I ordered this to keep my cat safe. It did keep her safe and was easy to install. But it was quite an eyesore. Even though it is clear it is noticeable. Ended up using dark chicken wire which matches the railing and is only 2 ft high. Better on the eyes.
1,Broken Batman,"This scooter was delivered to us in a neat and tidy Amazon box, but the interior box was bent and dog- eared. The toy was missing some parts necessary for assembly. I have written to Amazon about this and they have ignored by inquiry. The toy looks like it would be a lot of fun, but it needs to be in fully assembled order before it can be enjoyed."
2,Stadium Seat,"Product not as substantial as hoped. After one use one of the supports tore a hole in the nylon. Almost more comfortable to use as a double seat cushion as to open it up, especially if you like to jump up and cheer. The back always falls down. Would spend more to get one that is sturdier."
2,Out of date,"John is a great writer. I have a number of his books in my library.Unfortunately, he's not keeping up with the product. The primary changes in Excel 2003 (xml, SharePoint integration, InfoPath, etc) are essentially missing from his Book. No where does he explain how Excel's object model has been extended to support these important new features.Its like he took the Excel 2000 version of this book and pretty much just changed the date on the cover.I returned my copy."
4,Great book!,It is a great book if you would like to learn VBA in Excel. It desribes the steps or procedures clearly.
1,don't buy it,horrible book-the title is totally misleading and the author isn't qualified at all to write on the subject. It's basically his own musings from changing his diet around-no real knowledge or expertise. Wished i could return it within minutes of receiving it.
5,Citranox Cleaner,I originally purchased the product to clean rifle brass in an ultrasonic cleaner. The household applications are great for cleaning and disinfecting. I have a bathroom sink drain that did not smell so good and used 2 liters @ 20ml per liter of citranox with very hot water and after the initial flush with citranox followed by 4 liters of hot water problem solved. The sink drain is also flowing like new so it probably also cleaned a partially clogged drain. Awesome product and I will buy it again.
1,Commercial,This DVD is a very long commercial for the train service. It has very little scenery. It has very long discussions about how great the Orient Express train company is. Some detail about how they went about purchasing old cars and refurbishing them.
3,"nice product, but not sure about one thing","My trailer bike came nicely packed and I had no problems assemblying it. However, when turning, my bike's seat post also turned no matter how hard I tightened it. I did loosen up one bolt on the trailer so that the trailer could pivot left and right. However, I'm not sure if this was right. It seems like the bolt was overtorqued at the factory.So, is the trailer supposed to follow in a straight line, or is it supposed to pivot left and right like most trailers? The manaul did not address this issue.Thanks!"
1,Poor design,"Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole. Not recommended!"
1,Lots of static!,There is something seriously wrong with this recording. I downloaded one song and it has a lot of interference or static -- as if the instruments were too close to the microphone -- or something even more drastic. You can hear how bad the clip is on The Rose (& probably other cuts -- I was too pained to listen longer).
3,Good DVD but dated,The DVD was a good production but its was created when Franchione was the head football coach. Wait for a rental
2,"""toes the company's line"" and is very out of date","Unfortunately, just like most books of its kind (histories of specific firms written with full cooperation from the firm involved), ""The Perfect Store"" is way too obsequious to eBay's official ""party line"", and doesn't engage in real, hard-hitting, investigative journalism. Moreover, the book is severely out of date -- it tells you nothing about the last several years of eBay, and in a sector that changes as fast as internet commerce, this is a serious problem. The book is well-written and competently organized, but that doesn't make up for the substantial problems with the quality and timeliness of its conents."
2,Nothing new here,"If you've read news stories about ebay, you know what is in this book. It mentions key members of ebay's corporate world, but really gives no insight into the heart and soul of the company. Yes, it will be a fast read if you skip all the boring stuff."
2,Simply a corporate history,"I expected an interesting insight into ebay from this book, and got dry history. I would have enjoyed more positive discussion of the site and the community. I'm glad I bought a used copy and didn't pay full retail."
3,2GB Limit,"Not sure why so many of these cards refuse to list their limit on supported cards. This card only supports up to 2GB of SD ram. Anything more and you'll get copy errors. Please be aware of this when buying. Works great but I'm disapointed this information was not clearly posted, especially when there are so many sizes avail."
1,better editions of this wonderful tale are available,Get the ZITTAW press edition instead! It's filled with great information. This current is terrible and expensive. The ZITTAW press edition is excellent!
4,Quality Ambient,"Yes, its true, the music on this record is probably not for people who feel the need to wallow in self pity and cry into their Guinness while listening to various renditions of The Piano Man. However, minus the first half of Klangfilm which contains uninspired klanging this entire album is solid listenable ambient. I first heard Nuvisitor and BoxCutter on Pandora and immediately wanted to seek out the full recording. With the help of Audacity (on the first half of Klangfilm) I was not disappointed at all. Our Lady of the Skies creates some intelligent ambient spaces with a somewhat movie score pastiche, worth the $ if you like Hotogisu or Yellow Swans. But beware there is no terminally sad Irish weeping on this one."
5,A Good Alarm Clock,"I like this alarm clock and would buy one again. It is easy to take apart. The two yellow alarm wires are easy to find. It is easy to wire in a reed relay and capacitor to turn on a 120vac fire bell, which is what I did. It will be easy to put a switch in for either alarm, which I hope to do later. There is enough spare room inside the clock to put the components. The clock alarm isn't really that lowd, but I want the friend I'm building it for to be able to use it if he likes instead of the fire bell. The red LED display matches the red fire bell."
4,Simple yet enlightening,"This book takes what our current understanding of physics is, breaks it down, and explains in simple terms to the layperson how the universe, galaxies, our solar system and more came into existence and where it all is headed into the distant future.Absolutely enlightening and I loved every page!!"
5,Awesome,I like others baught this for r/c and i love it & will be getting others. I have jumped my bike from this ramp & I'm a full grown man. My kids even jump off this.It shipped crazy fast and it was even a saturday delivery.
1,not so good,"to simple..... rhythmic are not so nice... I expected much better, like solo parts, etc..... there is a dvd.... bye"
1,Great for 20 minutes,"This product worked wonderfully for the 20 minutes that it worked. I bought several different troy-bilt attachments for my string trimmer, and all of them except the string trimmer itself have failed. This product, like all of the troy-bilt attachments, seems to have a collar swaged onto the drive shaft that is probably intended to prevent damage to the motor head if you hit a rock. The problem is that instead of giving way only under imminent damage, vibration allows it to move and causes the drive shaft to lose contact with the motor head. Permanently. (Or at least until you repair it.) Also, you can't go back and reattach it because it will just move again in a few minutes."
4,Glad I found it.,"If you enjoyed Hanna and Her Sisters, you probably loved much of the musical soundtrack from the film. Many of my favorite songs from the film are included on this disc, as well as many others from other films of Woody's. Really enjoyable if this is your type music. I only wish it included a few more songs from the film I was hoping for."
1,Not a genuine Niles product,"AV-Express listed this as a Niles audio product. Not true. It is a Chinese knock-off, and it sells for much less on AV-Express' site. I sent Niles photos of the product, and they replied: From the photograph it does not appear to be our product; the packaging is different from ours, the part number WPM1K-2.0 and UPC code are not ones we use. Niles further replied: They are not an Authorized Dealer and we have never used those numbers. We have since contacted Amazon to have it looked into. If you want a knock-off, the product doesn't look bad, but it is falsely marketed as a Niles audio product. I contacted AV-Express through Amazon several times but received no reply. Thanks to Amazon's A-Z guarantee, I was able to get a refund, but the product is still listed on Amazon and advertised as a Niles product (this time by a vendor with a different name). I recommend following Niles' advice and purchasing the product from an authorized dealer listed on their website."
5,"Great product, easy to install.","Given all the different bike frame sizes out there, I was anticipating that the installation would not be pain-free. But less than 5 minutes after I opened the box, the rack was installed securely to my Trek mountain bike. The only tools needed were a screwdriver and and a wrench or two. The rack is very sturdy and has no problem supporting my fully loaded Topeak DXP bag on my daily commute. The bag slides on and off very easily. I think the rack will last a long time given its sturdy construction.Topeak QR Beam Rack EX Bicycle Rack"
1,busted after 23 months,"This rack seemed OK for awhile. It slipped a bit on the seat post until I added a cardboard sleeve. Today, it fractured near the weld near the post clamp. I'm not a gonzo rider but it does get a bit of shaking during my twice weekly rides. I'd say I ride on rough pavement about 70% of the time and on dirt/sand the rest. I've never overloaded it but I would expect a little greater lifetime."
2,"Rack itself is solid, plastic and rubber parts are poor quality.","I purchased a Topeak MTX BeamRack EX about 6 months ago. Within that time, the rubber bungee cord that is used to strap items to the rack has dry-rotted, cracked and ultimately snapped. Additionally, the plastic on the rack itself has become noticeably discolored and faded. I have never even used the bungee to strap anything to the rack, which is why I am both surprised and disappointed in the product so far. I would not have been so surprised had I kept this rack near sunlight, but it has been sitting on a shelf in my garage, far away from any direct sunlight.I paid approximately $40 for this product and I fully expect a product costing this amount to hold up longer than 6 months. I was planning to purchase a compatible RX trunk bag, however I am skeptical due to the poor quality of the product so far."
5,love the clay!,This is a fabulous product. I've been using it for a couple of years and can't say enough about it. It doesn't dry out my skin at all and seems to clean it well and control oily areas. It was introduced to me by my esthetician doing my facial and I've loved it ever since.
3,Mixed Reviews,"I bought this on Amazon and I have been using it for a week now.I must stay it is an effective cleanser for oily acne prone skin (which is what I have).However, it is costly and sometimes I feel like I have to cleanse my face twice, especially when I wear sun screen so I am using it a lot more then other cleansers I had and leaves my skin dry. I wouldn't recommend it to dry or normal skin.That being said, however, the skin feels really clean, squeaky clean.Also, the skin feels refreshed but when it goes near your eye (not even in the eye, but NEAR), it really stings.Would I buy it again? maybe. I can use this 2-3 times a week but not as a regular cleaner. Also, given the price point, I can find better products that will last longer."
2,Records over previous message,It should have a way to add more items to a shopping list. Next time you press record it overwrites what's on there you have to repeat everything which gets old when the list is longer.
3,Elliott Bakes a Cake,"Elliott the Moose leads his stuffed animal buddies in an adventure to make a birthday cake for Lionel Lion. They've got lots of problems in the kitchen, the least of which is how to open the full-sized oven! Separating eggs proves to cause great problems as do other directions in the recipe. The stuffed animals are cute. The fabrics the illustrated has used to create them have wonderful texture and colors. The cake recipe is at the end of the book. Good book to share with young ones who are learning to cook."
3,"Meh, it's pretty good.","I've been using this phone for ~ 1 year now. My music still plays through the speakers, but all skype sounds play through the phone (like it's supposed to). The problem is that sometimes the driver craps out. In this case, skype still works and you can still speak through the phone, but you just can't control skype with the buttons on the phone. Hope that made sense... I'm half asleep atm.Windows XP pro with most recent Skype version, btw.FYI, this phone (ear piece and microphone) works well with other voice messengers, except the buttons and functions are for skype only."
1,disappointed,"I have the Bad Cats book and love it, that is why I bought the calendar. I did not realize the pics were in black and white. If I had known that, I would not have bought it. Like another reviewer stated, they should have put that in the description. I would not recommend this calendar. Hopefully next year they will make the pics color or they wont sell many."
1,Terrible! Don't buy it!,"The box looks like the calender is in color , but it is black and white. The jokes are not funny and the pictures are poor quality. Not only that , the cats aren't doing anything bad like the calender suggests. They are just regular house cat pictures doing practically nothing but sitting around with stupid captions below. This calender I would not recommend. I got it as a gift and was so disappointed I had to write a review right away to say Don't Buy It! This sucks"
1,useless,"The first step for removing dried latex caulk with this product is to remove as much of the old caulk as possible - manually! Then, apply this stuff with a spout that is much too short, making it necessary to continually push the gel off the tub edge up onto the old caulk - this is for a horizontal application. Just start scraping with a utility knife, plaster knife, or single-edge razor blade. If you have to remove the old caulk manually, of what use is this?"
5,sweet story,"this is a really sweet story, showing how different all mommies are, but how they all try to help their kids in their own ways. It is a very cute book."
3,very basic information only,"If you are an O'Rourke addict,this will disappoint - less than the info on many dust jackets etc. Also the list of his publications is not complete. 3 stars on the basis that anything is better than nothing and technically it downloads, prints out and reads fine."
4,"Inspired by ""World Without Cancer"" DVD","Great book for many. Personally (I guess because I'm a manrather than a woman) I didn't find much that I thought I would like(too much pasta, and similar). Also a lot of mention of eggsthat I didn't understand what was meant."
1,"Diastolic okay, systolic not consisten","This is a convenient monitor, and seems to track well with a professional reading on the diastolic (lower) number, but is wildly inconsistent on the systolic (higher) reading.This is probably a limitation of using a wrist monitor, but with a 30 mm/Hg difference between what the monitor shows and what my doctor gets, it's pretty much useless for regular monitoring.Consider the Omron HEM-711 (upper-arm cuff, brachial sensor) or similar alternatives."
1,Not worth the bother.,"These gauze squares were pathetic. They were so thin, that one had to use 3 of them to one of a J & J square."
2,Flimsy.,These pads are super thin and not great. Was expecting a thicker version of gauze pads and can't imagine how anyone would use these.
2,"Probably a good product, but make sure you need it!","I purchased the XM home docking kit and tuner under the impression I could use the tuner in a portable device as well as with my home stereo system. It turns out that most, if not all, of the portable devices out there already have a built in tuner and come with a home docking station. Therefore it only makes sense to purchase the home docking kit and tuner if you don't plan on buying a portable receiver. Luckily Amazon customer service is awesome and they are taking the device back. Thanks Amazon, great as always!"
1,512 MB Sd Memory Card,"It's hard to review a product when it hasn't even shipped yet--despite the fact that the last day of the Amazon delivery estimate was today. This is the first time I am getting a part of my order from a third party (Databazaar in this case) without knowing it ahead of time, and it hasn't gone well... Obviously, the 1-star rating is not for the product, but for the shipper!"
4,High quality and versatile,"I bought this system to replace a Sanyo DVD player and self-designed audio system. I needed a system that played DVD+Rs and very few did. So, I settled on this system. I was pleasantly surprised. Sounds is crisp and clear, with good volume and depth. I do wish the sub was powered. The only other drawback for me is that it doesn't play DVD-Audio discs. It does what I need with pretty good quality."
4,Unexpectedly good,"I went into this film not expecting anything great, but was definitely pleasantly surprised. The only reason I knocked off a star is I was hoping for maybe one or two additional funny moments between Cyrus and John. The scene where John shows Cyrus that he found his sneakers and they finally call each others bluff is movie genius and completely hilarious. This is a realistic funny movie that somehow flew under the radar."
4,Excellent movie,"I watched Cyrus twice and would watch it again soon. Overall, a very funny and interesting movie that had us genuinely laughing out loud - especially in the first half hour. The acting was excellent, with some very subtle, great scenes with John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill.I could see this being a movie you'd need to be 'in the right mood' to watch, but give it a try."
4,Tasty but a bit too much honey,"This is a very good bar. There are lots of nuts and different kinds of fruit, but there is a bit too much sweetener (honey, etc). Good for breakfast, or half of one as a snack to get me through to lunch/dinner.Great price! Cheaper than Kind bars, although not as many different kinds available."
3,Olivier the great,"This is a marvelous display of Lawrence Olivier's acting. The entire story revolves around him. Unfortunately, the story is dark, bitter, and nasty, and Olivier, as the father, makes your flesh crawl. Bates is entirely miscast. A child actor played the son through 1936. And then, when the war is on, three years later or so, the son suddenly is a 40-year-old. It doesn't work at all. The entire production leaves one simply depressed...and full of wonder why media types refuse to run anything focusing upon a healthy and happy family."
1,Low Quality,Product is constructed poorly. It has been assemble a little over two weeks and yesterday when I went to life my self up from the glider I put my hand on the seat and one of the wood slates crack in half.
5,Color Temperature,"Amazon has listed the color temperature as 4500 degrees Kelvin which is totally wrong. Most profesional Studio spot lights are 3200 Kelvin, and this lamp does not outperform the professional equipment. The hotter a lamp burns, the more ""white"" the light is. (Most low color temp lamps produce a very orange color.) The Sun is 5500 Kelvin. This lamp's actual rated color temp from the Manufacturer's specs is 3025 Kelvin. Though it's not a perfect match, this lamp burns hot enough to be used in conjunction with pro equipment for extra fill lighing."
3,Not Joyce but writes like he skates,"I have heard people call Gonz a literary genius and this is pretty disturbing. This is definately not a work of literary genius. It is no ""ulysess"" or ""crime and punishment"". However, it is still a worthwhile read. Gonz writes like he skates casual, unpredictable, adaptable and creative. If you have ever felt like having a go at fronside boardsliding a handrail or writing a short story Gonz is your man for inspiration.Great stories that all skateboarders and other troubled youths can easily relate to."
4,Apple toasters,"They are good, better toasted. I bought these for my husband and he thought they were good but not great."
3,Made me want to have a drink....,"I read this book in one sitting on a Saturday night and it made me wish I had gone out and drank Manhattans instead. (This is a compliment to the author) Having spent fifteen years in the service industry both as a bartender and waitress, I found the stories in this book a bit boring. I was looking for some laugh out loud accounts and really good stories. I found the book a bit depressing, although I have to say that I have a lot of respect for the author and can fully relate to his tales. I would recommend this book to anyone who has worked in this business."
4,Good Buy,I bought this write n learn letter book for my three year old daughter and have found this to be a worthy purchase. She loves to sing along and explore new alphabets with this. I would surely recommend this product.
1,Broke the first time out!,"We bought the same Bell Triple-Back from the sports ""superstore"" at the mall. Calling it a 3 bike bike rack is a joke for starters. 3 children's bikes were a real tight fit. And one of the velcro loop straps broke off just tying the bike down to the load bar. I had to use zip ties. Then it COLLAPSED under the weight of those 3 kid's bikes on the highway. The straps holding the rack to the car were secure, but the support arm just popped its pin and fell down. It went back to the store."
2,Doesn't live up to its promises,"Royal had a good idea but it is poorly executed and doesn't live up to it adverts. It claims to transmit up to 70' and yet across an open patio, it will fail if further than about 15' from the receiver even with new batteries. Setting the alarms and C/F are illogical and counterintuitive. As someone else said, don't lose your manual or one day you will inadvertently set the max temp alarm and be cursed by the thing forever more (or 'til you find the manual). Royal posts pdf copies of a few of their product manuals on their website but not for their ""weather stations""."
3,statistics for dummies,"It was 50% helpful, 50% not helpful. There are no practice problems, which would be nice."
2,Not for beginners,"This book made my statistics class a little easier, although it still talks in a confusing mathematical language. It needed to focus on the beginner better."
3,Stat for Dummies,The book seemed to be very helpful to me and I decided to keep it in case a friend needs it
4,Fights statistics illiteracy - but doesn't teach statistics (enough),"This book amply warns against the many pitfalls of applied statistics - and does so extremely well.Unfortunately, the author does a poor job explaining the fundamentals of statistics. Although she discusses items like deviation, sample deviation and standard error, the reader is left at a loss how they all fit together. We do not get a coherent view of the basics of statistics! Her obsession to turn every chapter into an ""autonomous"" text is partly to blame, and doesn't really work because cross-references are all over the place (always a telltale sign of a badly structured text)Apparently this book is aimed at the general audience, and its main purpose seems to be teaching 'the rest of us' ""statistics literacy"". For that I give the author 4 stars.But as an introduction to statistics for the serious 'statistics student' this book fails."
2,Grill-2-Go,"This grill was great the first year I used it. It IS NOT a good grill to use if you want to take it camping. It is very heavy, hard to store, propane now leaks from the control knob, very difficult to move around and fell apart after the first year. If you want a grill to leave on your deck, then this MIGHT be ok. If you need a grill to travel with, then this is not the grill to get.I am now in the process of getting a Weber after two years use of the Grill-2 Go."
5,Grill review,I love this product. Very light weight and portable and lots of functionality. I've bought a Camp Chef grill which was very heavy and bulky and this is a nice replacement.
5,Tailgating Fun!!,"I got my Grill to Go Advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far. The makers of the Grill 2 Go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill. The open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models, it is still easy to transport, and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my Tarheels play basketball a lot of fun. I completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non-stick cooking surface for the cooking area."
5,Rooot Cellaring,"VERY informative. Lots of practical experience in this book. I bought it with the ""How to build a root cellar"" booklet, and between the two of them, I think I could do it myself (if I could dig a hole). At least now I know HOW to do it. This book has a lot of personal stories in it from the author and some of the ""old folks"" who grew up root cellaring. It covers how to preserve some vegetables that I've never even heard of, along with all the ones I already know. There are guidelines on how and when to harvest, and even sections on ingenious things folks have done when they didn't have enough space for a conventional cellar."
4,Nice book!,Interessting setups on how to get your own root cellar.Now I just need to have the cellar or space to put it into practice :-)
5,"DANG !! info out the ""waazzoo"" !!",i have been thru this book several times and will go thru again . it is quite comprehensive . what is lacking is some detail they cannot include ; local zoning laws and regulations and inso is quite complete .many type of cellars covered and fits with my departed Aunt's thoughts and experience on root cellaring . good stuph !!
1,Misleading,I was a little disappointed with this product mostly because the picture was very misleading and there was really no product description. I was expecting a single piece helmet as shown in the picture but instead I received a two piece that I have to put together. I have had a two piece in the past and paid a lot less from a previous seller. If I knew what I was getting I wouldn't have bought it.
3,"Fun, but....","This car is obviously fun for all kids. However, the assembly is a pain in the rear, especially the front roof supports. I bought it for my son's second birthday. Granted he's a bit above average and in 3Ts already, but it looks like the car is almost too small already even though it goes to 5. His feet are constantly hitting the tires as he pushes forward. Did these things shrink since we were kids?"
3,Great classic toy but stickers fall off after couple of months,"I was so excited to get this for our son. He loves riding in it to no surprise, it really is a great toy, but the quality is going down. Older models I've seen at yard sales are better quality than this new one. Door won't stay shut properly and stickers come off after a few months even if used indoors only. I should have bought a used one someplace, I totally wasted money on shipping and now I am stuck with a car with no stickers. I am very disappointed, but yes, this toy is a great fun for all kids I know."
5,Can't say enough about this toy...,My son received this as a gift for his first birthday and immediately adored this toy! It's a very sturdy toy and is easy for little legs to get in and out of. My son constantly hangs out the side and back windows and it never tips or bobbles a bit. My only wish is that the ignition key (which we think is the neatest thing) was somehow attached to the car...it's only a matter of time before my little devil loses it! Kudos to Little Tykes for continuing to manufacture an oldie but goodie!!!
2,I must have got a lemon...,"I just went through all 129 reviews for this toy, and most of them were glowing. My son received this car for his 2nd b-day and absolutely loves it. The only frustrating thing is that the steering wheel keeps coming off! Believe me, it wasn't easy to figure out how to put it on in the first place! It comes off almost every time he plays with it, and when that happens we have to wait for daddy to come home and fix it, because mommy is clueless. Just thought you potential buyers should know."
1,Ill fitting pieces make for almost impossible assembly,This sloppily made plastic toy took all the pleasure out of purchasing a special toy for our grandchild.Next time you try putting it together.Unfortunately we had just put together a Fisher Price riding toy that went together easily.So no more Little Tikes for us.
4,"A great buy, a must have",We actually purchased this along with the Roar N Rev by Little tikes. We keep the cozy coupe outside and the RNR inside. He can't get enough of either. Christmas morning he spent hours going back and forth between the two cars. My son is 20 months old and prefers the RnR but I truly believe every family should have one of these type vehicles in their home. The main reason we purchased this was because I have nieces and nephews that are 7 and still love to ride in these whenever they are at a house that has one.
4,not a good first ride on.,"My son recieved this as a Christmas gift. I really wanted to wait until his 2nd birthday, but a family member bought it without telling us. Anyways...I was looking at the Little tike race car toys for a first ride on, not this. This car was difficult to put together. The instructions were horrible (no words all pictures). After a few hours dh and I got it together. My son loves it, he jumped in turned the wheel, but the car didn't move. He plays in the car everyday, but has no clue how to get it to move. He also holds the door while getting his foot in and the car toppled over twice (on level ground). I have to walk around and push it for him. He also slid out from under the car afew times. The more he tried to get up or me help him get up, the more the car would move over him. He does push it himself, but he would rather ride in it than push it."
5,Fun outside toy,"We love this toy for our daughter. She is only 11 months old, but we have found it very handy already. It offers a great place to put her when we are trying to get things done around the yard. The cover gets her out of the sun, and she is able to look around and watch us. I am sure she will be vrooming around in no time!"
4,"Great toy, but had to make some adjustments...","We bought this toy for our 2 year old for Chrismas and were disappointed that we had such a hard time putting it together. We couldn't get the top on, as one of the front pieces wouldn't fit into the hole correctly, causing the door to fall off. Our toddler didn't know the difference, but I read all the other reviews and it seems that many parents had a similar experience. Rather than cutting the plastic (red) with a utility knife as recommended, we simply filed it down a little, put some lubricant on it and jammed it in. Now, it's perfect!"
2,"""Let's make getting the temperature as hard as possible.""","Man, I'm sure glad that these guys didn't design any aircraft I've been flying on! How can you possibly screw up getting the temperature? I agree with the other review that, without the manual, fat chance you could figure out how to switch from C to F with this thing. I've done it a half dozen times and still dont' remember how I did it each time. Setting the hi and low alarms? Who cares!I must admit, this thing is still working for us after 3 years and the display is pretty easy to read (as long as the batteries are fresh, and they won't be for long). My next digital thermometer will probably not be a Royal."
3,Too Little For The Wii,"Since the Wii came out last year, there have been many different accessories that have been made for the system. Although most of them have been very well recieved, others just don't really hit the nail on the head. This Wii game case is a compact holder that can unfortunately hold as many as 8 games for the system. That unfortunately is sad. There are other video game accessories that hold much more than this. I really suggest you get something bigger for all your Wii games. This price for the holder doesn't seem right.Price: C-Convience: COverall: C 1/2-"
2,Give us the original albums!,"Two stars is probably too low but I want to make a point:How I hate ""edited"" (=mutilated) tracks! For instance, why wasn't it possible to include the whole 18 minutes GET READY in this compilation? All we get here are a ridiculous 3 minutes of it.Similarly, KEEPING ME OUT OF THE STORM is cut off before thekiller guitar kicks in, and many other tracks are shortenedas well. Why on (rare) earth isn't it possible to release their original albums??Foremost Get ready, Rare Earth Live (one of my top 5 live albums), Midnite Lady (Wine Women and Song alone is worth your money), Back to Earth (the latteris a strange beast on vinyl; gorgeous first side, forgettable second side) are sorely missed."
3,Whispy,"Sorta insubstantial; MnM takes the quiet, laidback tendencies of Keep Moving to an extreme, with very delicate songs and arrangements. It's not bad; not bad at all. Yesterday's Men is poignant, and the title track and Coldest Day are good. Ultimately, it certainly isn't a very consequential record--it doesn't leave much of an impression--I think 1988's The Madness is ultimately a better record--but it's still worthwhile for fans, especially at the price. Finis."
2,Pain in the butt,"Im just going to be honest, These do not stick very well. Try anther brand it may work better for you."
5,Kidkusion corner guards,"I have had a set of these on a table for a year now; surprisingly durable even though made out of foam rubber. Never had one fall off, although maybe because I attached it to the top of the table corner instead of the underside, so gravity is working in my favor.I am going to buy another set for another table."
1,just awful!!!!,What a waste of my money. Of all the money I have wasted in my life this has to be the worst. It is impossible to get the backing of the tape and than it doesn't even stick. It is a horrible product.
2,"Nice cushions, but no adhesive","There's nothing wrong with the cushions themselves, but they don't come with glue, tape or sticky backing, so you'll have to buy those separately!"
1,flimsy adhesive,"the adhesive for this corner guard is awful. it's almost impossible to separate the double sided tape and once you do it is very flimsy. i dont know if other ones are better, just that this one is awful."
2,Not worth it,"We bought these because we have a black coffee table and they were the only ones we could find in black. It was a waste of money. Like everyone else said - the tape is horrible! They do not stick at all! I tried putting on some other tape and it didn't work either. My dogs knocked them off in one day and chewed them, so I can't even return them. They are actually kind of small too - if you have a larger coffee table or corners, these might not work for you."
1,waste of money,"They don't stick in furniture corners, is a total waste of money, my baby can just take them a play with them"
5,Thank You for showing me the light,"Too often, while going through this book, did I say to myself, ""I've tried that"", often recalling the mixed results I had. This book and the awesome accompanying CD has empowered me to return to those battles with a concise set of tools, to get the results I was looking for the first time. The section on resolving PDF data was immediately helpful, as were the Pivot Table sections of the book. Excel is my first choice for an analyses tool, both for my business and of my business. The techniques and tools presented in this book have quadrupled my abilities to do both. I've wasted too much time wading through reference books and help screens to achieve the results I've always felt were possible within Excel."
2,Good Book but.......,This book has alot of good information but my issue with it is that the author uses primarily R1C1 cell referencing rather than the typical A1 notation. I'm not going to get into which one is better than the other but I will say that if you're not comfortable with R1C1 then most of the examples in the book with be much harder to understand. It does however cover lots of other topics within Excel development that I did find useful & informative. Let me know when the A1 notation version of this book is released... ;)
3,Not All Its Hyped Up to Be,"This was an over hyped mini series. Though groundbreaking and even well written, it lacked all that it was cracked up to be. We find out who Wolverine is. We find out where he is from and what he does for several years. But then it stops. We don't find out how he joins the army or Weapon X, or anything. It leaves us at a literary cliffhanger. Good, definitely worth a look, but ""Half His Origin"" sounds like a more appropriate title."
2,A Disappointment,"For all the hype over this ""untold"" origin story, I found it to be a let down. This is not a Wolverine story. It is a gothic horror/romance that actually raises more questions than it answers. To me, the character in this tale seems completely disconnected from the comic character as we know him. If you're looking for insights into Wolverine, you won't find them here.Yes, the art is good, and the story does throw in a few twists, but ultimately I found it to be one big downer. In the end, nothing is really resolved, character and plot threads are left dangling, and no one ends up happy. When I finished reading, I felt depressed and unenlightened. That's why I can't really recommend it."
3,Not Bad.,"This figure from Mattel's new line of Bat-figures is actually pretty good. The color scheme works pretty well and the dark knight is actually dark as oppsed to the other figured such as the green hydro-suit batman or martial arts batman. The additions on this oufit (or armor) makes Batman look like he's from the not too distant future. Overall, it's pretty good."
5,Excellent book!,"I'm over 40, and these stories were effective enough to scare me. They remind me of the old Night Gallery series in style; they certainly would have been worthy of becomming episodes. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys scary tales. You will not be disappointed. Roberta is a remarkable writer, and she pulls you right into her stories and keeps you there until the very end. Then it's time to hide under the covers. :o)"
4,A good read,"I think this book has gotten some mixed reviews because people have a hard time understanding the subject matter.One reviewer wrote The book is depressing and the main character unbelievable .... I can see how it would be depressing, due to what the book is based on. But the main character, in my opinion, was very believable. The abuse statistics are devestating, and they'd be much higher if everyone reported what happened to them behind closed doors.While I did think Sloan focused a bit too much on Ricky & strayed away from the two main characters a bit too much, I enjoyed the book. I thought it was an honest look at what happens all too often for some families."
5,Sloan does it again,"I love all of Susan Sloan's books, and this was no exception. I was surprised at the mixed reviews, but do agree with another reviewers opinion that perhaps the subject matter made it seem depressing to some readers. Once again the characters came alive off the page and I was totally absorbed in their drama, this one keeps the reader glued to the pages so don't pick it up if you've got things that need getting done! Valerie is a character I'll think about for some time to come, and I have to say that the ending pleased me very much, bravo Susan Sloan, another great read, looking forward to the next one!"
5,Very good!,"This was my first book of Susan's that I have read. I loved it! I was not bored at all. I did not think it was over long either. It was sad because Valerie didn't (Spoiler!!)...but in life that happens.I will now read the other books written by Susan. Also, being familiar with Rutland and the Seattle area was nice. Who has ever heard of Rutland, VT? Me. Hope Susan's previous books are as good as this one."
4,Difficult subject matter,"The reviews on this book are certainly mixed so for what its worth, here's what I thought.The subject matter is somewhat difficult but at other times (further into the book) it reads like a Sidney Sheldon and the last sentence is totally surprising.But I do agree with the reviewers who had it hard understanding Valerie. I really thought she was a very stupid woman and found it hard to sympathize with her."
2,Not Very Good,I'm not sure why this was listed as romantic suspense since there's nothing at all suspenseful about it. The bad guy is about as obvious a bad guy as you'll ever come across.Julia's obsession with Brian also made no sense. Every kid has some problems at home. The way she jumped on his and seemed so determined to see abuse where there was none was just silly. Not to mention the way she kept sticking her nose into things that were none of her business.Don't waste your time...Andrea Kane's later efforts are much better.
2,major unrealistic,"The heroine of this book is a teacher who attends the little league games of one of her students and makes it clear to everyone that she ""loves"" him. If you're a parent or teacher you realize right off how unprofessional and unrealistic this is. Then we have reporters who follow a state senate candidate to his child's games to ask grilling questions. Come now, most state senate candidates have to resort to courting the press, not the other way around. The book wasn't worth finishing."
3,Hot .....but......,"The mug holds a temperature like promised. Great, bestI had so far.However it's low circumference and great hightmake the liquid swap back out of the cup, when tiltedto fast, after taking a sip."
1,Last A Month,"This Litter Maid ran fine for four ( 4 ) weeks, then it gave up the ghost. I even got an on-line manual to fix it myself. In the end it became a ( very expensive ) boat anchor."
3,Littermaid Sucesses and Problems,"I have owned my Littermaid for 3 years and overall it works well.It scoops the poop and puts it in a box. Thats to good part.Now the bad stuff.GOD help you if you have to deal with the company for warranty assistance. They are slow. Figure 3 months to get a replacement.If you live in the South like me you may have a problem finding litter that works. Every litter I have used clogs the Littermaid.In despiration, I cut 1/4 inch off every other tooth on the rake. Now it works purr-fectly.Because it now works with no assistance from me I rate it 3 stars."
3,"Nice Product , cheap construction","I like the idea of this product, and I am still using it, but the construction is mediocre. The rake keeps coming off the track and the plastic and surrounding construction feels like it is going to break in 6 months. For [this price], you think they could spend a little more on the material to make it last longer. If I had an engineering degree, I would make one out of wood or metal or hard plastic, not recycled sandwich baggies. Oh, and [they want me to pay more for a canopy.] Has anyone ever heard of a cardboard box? It worked for Eddie Murphy in Trading Places, it can damn well work for my two cats."
1,Good luck trying to get a broken unit replaced,"I have had my liter maid box less than one month. It has worked fine until this past week when some obscure plastic part broke. Now the rake has no tension and dosn't do a thing except flop around. I have spent hours calling all the numbers provided by Liter Maid to get a new unit sent, or somehow fixed. Talk about a run around. Now I am told I must return it through Target.com. Good luck trying to figure out how to do that. I have found no contact phone number or any way to return this defective product. Nothing like a $100+ waste of money. Works fine if it works, but heaven forbid it breaks and you try to replace it."
2,More work than it's worth,"I've owned one for 3 months and I have a love hate relationship with it. I like having box cleaned automatically, but it ends up being more work than it''s worth:-Litter gets everywhere because there is no cover that forms a tight seal (like other hooded boxes do). It also gets stuck in all of the cracks and grooves in the box.-Some of our cats dig holes before they go and the littermaid doesn't allow for much litter so they end up going on the plastic. When they scratch afterwards the ltter ends up sticking to the bottom of the box which the rake doesn't get. I end up having to scoop it everyday manually anyway.I'm hoping somebody else has come up with a better design, because I would be willing to pay more for a better box."
2,Expensive cat toy that doesn't cut it.,"Just 2 years and $180.00 later, I'm having to buy a new box. This jams frequently, requiring manual scrape out, and at least monthly DEEP cleaning that takes literally ALL DAY. It also doesn't keep litter in the box even as well as the old fashioned manual ones, so a tent was necessary to confine the mess. Now the motor has completely given out. Am currently looking for one I saw at PetCo that, rather than sifting clumping litter, WASHED reusable ceramic pellets with a special enzyme detergent up to 3 times daily. At only twice the price of a littermaid deluxe model, I figure it'll be a bargain in the long run if the cats will use it."
3,for 1 kitty only,"I have had my litter maid for less than a year. I really liked it because it does a great job of keeping the smell under control. However, now that have two cats in the house it doesn't have the ability to keep up. So, if I still only had one cat than it works great. Otherwise, I'm going to need to invest in the Littermaid Mega which does work really great for a multi cat family."
1,More trouble than convenience,"I didn't like the Littermaid at all. I only kept it for about 2 months. It's really, really loud, and would always wake me up at night. The receptacles would fill up just about everyday, and the hassle with removing and replacing them was more trouble than just scooping. The rake would also spill just as much litter on the floor as the cats kicked up. Also the ramp did nothing to help with the litter mess, my cats just jumped over the side to avoid the ramp (but maybe your cat will like the ramp?). I've recently switched to using scoopable wheat kitty litter (swheatscoop.com). I'm back to scooping, but it's flushable so that makes it easy for me since my litter box is in the bathroom so that way I don't have to bag it and throw it out."
1,Save your money,"I would really recommend that you save your money on this one.The major complaints I have are that:1. it is VERY noisy2. when it has too much litter in the pan, it collects at the end and the scoop can't pick it up so it repeats the process FIVE times before it shuts off. See #13. the receptacles are expensive so you're not done shelling out the money after the initial investment.4. kitty litter gets everywhere on the floor.5. very few clumping litters work, most are too heavy for the scoop after the kitty's done with it."
3,Quality is spotty..great when it works,"I bought a Mega the year they came out (99?) and had 5 cats at the time. It outlived three of the cats. It was a workhorse and I LOVED it. Unfortunately the quality seems to have gone down.I bought a regular size for my Mother this spring and it is always getting stuck and -yes we have tried every litter under the sun including Littermaid's own. It is still better than scooping multiple times a day, but it isn't the labor saver my original was.My workhorse finally died last week, so I gambled and bought a new Mega. It works but not nearly as well. The rake doesn't reach down as far as my original and it tends to leave a layer of unscooped clump on the bottom. I'm going to try the silcon spray, but think that it just isn't as well made as they used to be. I'll give it one more week and then return it and try a new one if the performance doesn't improve."
4,4 cats love littermaid,"I have 4 cats - 2 male, 2 female - First Littermaid we bought died after 1 yr. The wires that run the rake broke. Bought another one - has lasted over 5 years. With my 4 cats I also had a regular litter box in another bathroom, but bought another Littermaid for that room. Prior to getting the additional one - one of my male cats would do his business in the soaking tub in my master bath - seems this was his way of telling me the regular litter box was too 'dirty' for him. With the addition of the new Littermaid he has not left me any surprises in the tub. I have always used Fresh Step Scoopable Litter - Yes, sometimes you have to get the stuck litter off the bottom of the tray or the rake, but if you clean the tray & rake regularly it won't stick. The rest of the inside of the unit I clean with paper towel and Lysol. Last one I bought @ another retailer...For me, great investment."
1,Did not work properly,I had a littermaid and it worked for more than 5 years perfectly. It seems the new models are not made as well and they do not work as well. This model did not retract properly.
1,Embarassing Christmas Gift,"I got this product for my niece thinking it was a healthier way forward while she goes through her first pregnancy. Unfortunately, her excitement over this gift was extremely short lived. She had the unit for only a couple weeks before the rake got clogged from the clumping litter and stopped moving. I'm embarrassed by my gift and very unhappy with the product quality. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time, money and energy on this product."
1,"If you have used it, then you would rate it a -5","Don't bother with wasting the money on it. Anyone who has used it will agree with a rating of negative 5, daily cleaning, of not only the cat box it self but the area around as it throws dung all over, up to 6 feet away. I have had 4 of these, the first I had to wash off with a hose and it quit working after being in use for 6 months. That one was the best. The next one lasted 1 day before it broke. I returned it, the next two lasted about 30 days. As I write I am about to request a RMA so that I can ship this one back as the rake guides broke again. I have tried their cat litter and several of the brands that meet their recommendations but still nothing works."
1,Not Worth the Money or the Hassle,"It's time to kiss $200 (and Litter Maid) goodbye.We bought one and it seemed to do the job so after a week we bought a second one. BIG MISTAKE.One machine broke and the rake just flopped around and couldn't scoop. We were able to get a replacement - but it is still in the carton - because the other litter box is always jamming. And they sent the wrong model (a cheaper one). I can't even return that one to the store since it is reconditioned and not the correct model.One of our three cats tends to pee on one side of the box and the clump is getting stuck to the bottom of the pan. We can only imagine that the urine goes down the side of the pan, under the litter, and then clumps and sticks - constantly. We tried EVERY recommendation in reviews to try and stop the sticking.I will give the replacement box away and throw away the used one. Maybe the next owner's cat will pee right in the middle.It's back to the old-fangled poop and scoop box."
1,piece of junk,This thing is a piece of junk. I bought it because of a glowing recommendation from a friend of mine. It keeps going through it's cleaning cycle. Over and over. It even does it with no liter added. I have tried everything I can think of to make it work the way it is suppose too. The only way I can get it to stop is to turn it off - then it is just another litter box and I wasted over $100.
1,Loud Motor,I am not happy with my LitterMaid box. The motor is very loud when it cleans the box and it scares my cats. It also does not clean 10 min. after the cat has left the box. Instead it cleans at random times like 3:00 in the morning or while the cat is in the box. My poor cats are scared everytime that they use the box because they are afraid that it will attack them.
4,HP Wireless Optical Mouse Rechargeable,when battery needs recharging it gets skippy. Otherwise a great choice.
5,HP Wireless Optical Mouse Rechargeable,Save a lot of time to change batteries. I only need to put it back to its dock when not using and wonder that current market does not product some thing similar this with this reasonable price.
5,Amazing player!,"Tommy is an unbelievable guitar player. It's not usually my thing, but my husband made me watch it...glad he did because I have never seen anything like it. It's hypnotizing! Not suprising that he got nominated for a Grammy. Watch it, you will be amazed as well."
5,The Mystery,"Tommy Emmanuel is the worlds greatest guitar player, it is amazing he can write these beautiful songs too. A very enjoyable purchase !"
4,Good for pre teen siblings of AS.,I bought this book for my 7 yr old son with AS. He did read it with in minutes but he did not seem to relate to the story.I read the book first and from a outsiders point of view it makes sense it explains some of the behaviors my son has been exhibiting and why but at a childs level. I would suggest this book for a sibling more than a child with AS themselves.
5,Asperger Book,"This is a good book. Short and very discriptive. With good helpful tips. I have a 7 yr old but, I didn't have him read this yet. I don't think he would get it yet. But, later it will be good for him to read. It is a great tool to let teachers read to help them understand your child with Asperger Syndrome. We are new to this and it was helpful to me."
5,How to cope with a child that has aspergers syndrome,"My child is a second grader, I went to my first parent teacher conference and was told by the teacher how my child performed his school work. And I needed to speak to him about how to do better in school.I got a call within the month that he still was the same and maybe I should have him speak to a Physchologist, I was taken back because I did not think anything was wrong. After several weeks of testing I had the last meeting that diagnosed with aspergers syndrome. This book exactly sums it up in simple language. I have my 12 year old daughter reading it so that as a family we can understand why he is special."
4,Helpful for Us,"This book describes my 8 yr old AS boy to a ""T"". I donated several copies to our school library. His teacher says it's been helpful."
3,Assembly nightmare,"Assembling this product was a nightmare. I promised my 3 year old I would put it together after she went to sleep and she could play with it in the morning. It took over 2 hours. The directions did not match the product. There were steps in the directions the manufacturer had already completed, there weren't enough washers, screw holes were in some case too small and in one case they hadn't completed the hole at all. I was not prepared to be drilling through plastic to put together what looked like a simple plastic toy. The clip broke as I screwed it in (I was following all applicable directions). So I have no usable clip, which was the main feature I was excited for. My child has yet play with it. I am sure it will be a hit, but for the price I am frustrated."
4,Wonderful - Except.....,"I got this for my 2 year old from Santa this year. She loves it! It was super easy to put together (I did it without my husband's help in under 45 min.) I only have two very minor complaints - the white holders on each side come off pretty easily. With little to no effort my daughter pulls them off when just playing around it. Also, the chalk they include is so dusty I had to use my vaccum cleaner to suck up all the dust. So, if you buy this - which I would recommend - buy your own chalk for the chalk board side."
2,unsatisfied,I expected more of this product. Assembly to be done should have and could have already been done by manufacturer. The clip for the paper is terrible - there should be two. The paper falls to easy. The side bars are too easy for the kids to lift.
3,A good book to have,"I thought this book was well written and I enjoyed reeding it it has lots of coulourful pictures has well has some intresting information about the fish. It does review all the famous discus breeders in singapore and it tells you there methods of rasing perfect discus, it is a good book to have around."
3,Dr. Clifford Chan's Book of Singapore Discus,"I feel very disappointed when received this book. In some reason, all the pages were stuck together like kept in the high humidity place.Most of the pictures look like old picture (may cause by printing process) . There should be show the strain of Discus available more than this."
2,"Our puppy likes it, but destroys it...","I gave this to our 9 week old lab puppy, and he enjoys chewing on it. He also really likes to chase it. The product is not very durable though. Within a couple minutes, one of the knots started coming apart. After half a day of play, the bumps on the ball are coming off. We bought a squirrel squeaky mat (made by Kyjen) the same day and we gave it to him several days before the chew chain. The squirrel toy has been played with a ton more than the chew chain, and it has held up incredibly well. I wouldn't buy this product again. I am going to stick with the Kyjen toys from now on."
2,Puppy was able to chew the spikes off immediately,Our pup loved the chain but was able to very quietly eat the small spikes off the blue ball. I cannot let him have this toy anymore.
1,No-go,Sadly the DVD is for the USA - the Region code for S.Africa is Region 2 which is also the format for the PAL system - so we are unable to watch this DVD . Is there any way to ensure that this error does not occur again?
2,"See the movie ""Fireproof"" instead","More would be gained by simply going with your spouse to see the movie ""Fireroof"". The book has some helpful ideas though."
4,beautiful animals,the scenery and animals are beautiful. however this is the same as the other safari 3d. they just changed the cover so i thought it was another one. one thing i do not like is when he drinks blood of a cow. they should have left that out. there was no good reason to put that in. there is no real out of screen action but still a beautiful dvd. i
5,Excellent Book,"For those that have not served in the Marine Corps, ""Semper Fi"" is an excellent look into the leadership principles, and ideas that make the Marine Corps stand out from all other organizations. ""Semper Fi"" gives you the insight into how the Marine Corps created a legendary culture that has thrived for over 220 years."
5,Excellent Book,"As a former Marine and Boy Scout Professional, This books has given me excellent advice about dealing with people, making the goal, and doing so with efficency."
5,Great business ideas,"As a Marine veteran, this book gave alot of good ideas. The authors tell you different aspect of how the Marine Corps is ran and they explain why the Marines do this and how to implement it into the business world."
5,A lot depends on your people and your culture,Semper Fi does a good job of relating the organizational and cultural strengths of the Marine Corps to successful essentials for corporate America. The beginning of the book emphasizes the importance of recruiting and maintaining the enthusiasm and energy or new hires. The book keeps it focus on sharing the attributes of the Marine Corps' organizational attributes contributing to its success rather than organizing around what corporate America needs and how the Marine Corps has solved those problems. Strongly recommended for HR professionals and managers leading large organizations. Always a good book for former Marines although some may remember a few details of Marine life differently.
3,Strong description of USMC but weak on translating ideas.,"A great book to read if you want to learn why the USMC creates the best leaders. The authors do a good job describing why the USMC survives as a premier fighting force. However, for those who want to take that example and use it for everyday management in the corporate world the book falls short. A good attempt to show the USMC superior sense of value and leadership but short on the corporate application side. The authors don't take the transfer of Corps leadership building to corporate implementation far enough. I recommend it for those who don't understand the difference between leadership and management. It does well as a beginning for those who want to absorb proactive management from the pros. A sequel with specific actions, examples and practical methods of implementation would be great."
1,Believable?,"Mr. Zimmerman claims a PhD in PolSci on his website and here. When called to the carpet on the topic this morning in a radio interview, he admitted reluctantly that he actually forewent his PhD in order to run for Senate twice, which he claimed he WON! After which he clarified ""I came in SECOND PLACE"". Wow! With embellishments on truth and fact at the most basic level about himself, and then advertising misinformation about himself, can we really take anything he claims as expertise in the political arena seriously? I truly question any veracity of anything from this man... Proceed with caution."
5,SUPERB,"RELIGION AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. DERRIDA FALLS SHORT OF EXPLAINING THE NEED FOR RELIGION AND TRANSCENDENCE, BUT AS USUALLY HE IS FASCINATING AND DIFFICULT."
1,Too cute and too vapid,"I am a computer professional although new to Unix. Also I am a ""for Dummies"" book fan in most instances, but this one is a waste of money. Wading through all the cutsie remarks is annoying. Furthermore, cute remarks take up space that should be devoted to more comprehensive text such as explanations and examples of Unix commands and concepts. A previous reviewer suggested ""Teach Yourself Unix in 24 Hours"" and I took his suggestion, and am glad I did."
1,Zero Stars,No food critic.Just a potty mouth who finds cheap places that most folks won't like.Leone's in-your-face-proud of-my ingornance-stance may amuse some readers.
4,Great reference book,Comprehensive book and excellent reference book for any seismologists library. Up to date and includes materials on modern current practices
1,Poor description,"These erasers have a confusing size listed, the picture is deceiving and they are not good for carving stamps (as I do) due to the tiny size. These are run of the mill drafting erasers that can be found at any Office Max. The good erasers (IMO) are the same material but twice as big. The listed size did not make sense to me and the picture showed two sizes of erasers (so I thought at the very least I would be getting one big and one small).There are other ""jumbo"" vinyl erasers on Amazon if you seek to make stamps that will fill a name tag sticker.I would not recommend these erasers for carving."
1,Bad rewiew,"It breaks down every two-three months!I change it to new 2 times, after that the shop where I bought decided to give me another company product.VERY BAD!The only thing I liked in it -its design...Really small and comfortable but...DOESN'T WORK!!!"
4,odd couple,"though their lives and personalities were quite dissimilar its all too fine to illustrate comparisons.these painters were very courageous image makers for their time and its tough to get it all in, but JF does it well and makes for interesting reading."
3,Required Reading for class...,"This book was a required reading for my college minorities studies class. It wasnt very interesting... Barlow seemed to ignore how globalization impacted other races, aside from blacks, of the US. Long read, very dry."
2,Glad it was on sale...,"Bought this on clearance and it was only worth the clearance price, in my opinion. Within 2 months, I had spent more on filters than I had on the actual purifier. No, it didn't clean the air well and it was very loud. I stopped using it after 2 months because it wasn't worth all the trouble of finding and buying the filters anymore."
1,This book is dangerous!!!,"I repeat, this book is dangerous! If my clients ever understand the consequences of what this book presents, I'm in trouble! The fact that you can change the whole behaviour of a program by simply changing one line of code (policy classes) or generate complete class hierarchies generically, and numerous other things, they'll expect that I can do everything in no time at all. There go my billable hours!!! No really, I actually give this book 6 stars because it has finally shown me ways of doing things I've always wanted to do but lacked the intelligence to figure out myself (namely generic Object Factories, Functors, among other things). I'm still looking forward to Andrei's description of a generic Observer class as that has been stumping me for quite a while now. I've had to read this book a few times just to absorb what's going on. As for practical, I've applied the concepts to be able to write code in a few lines instead of thousands."
4,Power of generic programming,"This is an excellent book on the power of C++ templates. Even though I have been using templates for several years to create simple reusable code etc, this book has opened my eyes to new ideas and concepts using templates. Right from the first chapter this book takes you on a fascinating journey of learning that culminates in a library of powerful and useful templates."
1,This superman is NOT made of steel,BREAKS very easy - this is why we stopped selling these... almost everyone shipped out had a complaint about the hand falling off... Manufacturer defect on all these.. worst sup toy ever seen...very poor quality
2,Just So-So,"Maybe being forced to read this book for class has colored my thoughts some, but there's not a lot of good things to say about ""The Hacker Crackdown."" It rambles aimlessly and is overloaded with boring technology information. Only occasionaly interesting."
3,Teething stick,"Dog doesn't seem interested in it, perhaps if it were larger. Like the fact that it makes a noise doesn't seem to stay frozen long."
5,Awesome Chew Toy for Teething Puppy,"I have a 9 week old small puppy who just began teething and attempts to chew on everything. This is his preferred toy, especially after we've left it in the freezer to get it nice and cool. He literally plays with it for hours. It's durable and the the crunchy noises are great for him without being annoying to us."
2,cool teething?,"I never put this into the freezer to get cool for my puppy. Maybe that's why she doesn't have much interest in it. Without the cooling effect, this toy is definitely overlooked by both dogs. But I will try the cooling effect and re-review."
3,Good before they get their teeth,"This is great while the dog is teething...after they get their teeth...not so much. The material is thin, which helps it freeze, but that also means that it will tear easily. Additionally, all the stringy parts that stick out of this toy can be choking hazards. We cut them off before giving to our dog, but definitely consider that before purchasing.Overall, a decent toy for small puppies who don't yet have teeth."
1,tiny toy,The pictures are VERY deceiving!!! The toy arrived and it's the smallest $7 dog toy I've ever seen. You'd be better off buying something from one of the big chain pet stores
2,Not very durable,"my puppy likes this toy, due to his teething, but the problem is it fell apart within a couple weeks. I would love this if they had used more durable fabric, the kind they used is very thin and the parts that hang off also get pulled off easily."
3,Doesn't work on my Mac Pro running Leopard,"For some reason, this unit doesn't work at all on my Mac Pro running Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), but it works fine on a Mac G5 running 10.4 (Tiger) so I just use it on that computer."
2,trouble w/ high storage mem cards,"windows XP: it works fine w/ my 256MB memory card, but freezes w/ my 2.0GB memory card. Others devices (e.g. my camera) work fine with both memory cards, so I believe the cards are working properly.Linux: linux even has detected the device."
3,Book that could be great,"I have repeatedly turned to this book to help me with real estate accounting and am often frustrated that there is not sufficient detail or breadth to actually answer my questions. This book seems to have been very hastily written and in my opinion should be revised and expanded. I hope that the authors will prepare an expanded version of this book, but purchasers should realize that in its present form it is only marginally useful."
2,"Good, but not durable","The sound quality is very good, but they player itself is really cheap and isn't very durable. I only had mine two months before it broke. It's also very hard to get help or service from the BUSlink company. In my opinion I would pay an extra $10 or $20 for a quality name brand 256MB MP3 player."
1,BAD PRODUCT AND NO SUPPORT - DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM BUSLINK,"I bought a Buslink Mp3 player in a Datavision Store in NY (Datavision is a big reseller, listed in Buslink page).The unit sound volume is weak, but this is not the problem. After just 3 months of use the unit wont play mp3 anymore, the screen went crazy every time I start it, and then froze. I contacted Buslink to got a replacement but I got THE WORST SUPPORT, INDIFERENCE AND BAD ATTENTION from they, particulary from Ivan Smith, customer support. Walk away from Buslink. They cannot replace the unit without the invoice from Datavision, they do not honor your waste , confidence nor preference. Stay away from Buslink, a unit that lasted only 3 months and they wont replace. I REPEAT, THE WORST QUALITY AND SUPPORT I GOT IN TONS OF PURCHASES. DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM BUSLINK."
5,Good strut mount.,"First off, as of October 18, 2012, the picture Amazon shows is wrong. In fact the picture on the box is even wrong (it came in a retail box). Monroe shows the right picture on their webpage. All you get is the strut mount itself and two nuts, and a small piece of paper which says to consult the factory service manual for instructions on how to install it. There is no indication of country of origin anywhere on the mount, box, or piece of paper. I have only had this strut mount on long enough to test drive the car over a few speed bumps, and so far the car seems OK, and the new strut mount itself seems to be of good quality. It's replaced an original strut mount on a 1995 Ford Escort that had rusted through. It was reasonably easy to install, the only special tool that you need is a spring compressor."
4,18 True Survival Stories,"This book is full of excellent stories of survival in the vast and varied wilderness of Alaska. What I enjoyed most about these stories was the sense of ordinary people up against the extraordinary forces of nature and circumstance. There's a personal flavor to some of the chapters. Almost as if you're hearing your neighbor telling a story about his cousin up in Petersburg. Is this the best written book in the world? No, but the true stories are pretty good."
5,Love this Book!,The item was just as described in the description. It was in wonderful condition and was sent in a very timely manner. I was very pleased with this item.
5,"""Criminal class what you make me out to be...""","On the Front Line and For the Punx are by far my favorite albums by the Casualties. This particular album is, in my opinion, one of their raunchiest. I heard some of their new album, Resistence I think...CANNOT wait till that's out, unless it already is, not sure. If you're looking for music to get piss'd to or with, buy this album and finally wake yourself up to REALL and GOOD music.Buy you fools, BUY!"
5,Excellent work!,I strongly recommend this album by Lenine. It's excellent! I did not know his work until recently. I was amazed with his style and repertoire. Don't miss it!
2,Free support is non existent.,Not worth the price. The State entries depend on the Federal entries and if wrong cannot be corrected and filed electronically.
3,"Product was fine, but shipping...","The product was fine. However, when we received them, approximately 20 of them were broken. I would order the product again, but maybe a different store."
2,thank's for the speed of delivery,"Thank you for the speed of delivery. But the quality of the DVD is very inferior, it is just a bad copy vhs!!!!"
1,very dull,this item is a waste of money it is very dull and is a pain to cut with. just use any box cutter.
1,knife is sharp enough but broke right away,"I bought this knife to trim pleated vinyl shades. The packaging states not to twist knife, however, when I sliced down halfway into the shade, knife got sandwiched in the shade and the slightest movement snaps the handle right off.Might be a good idea to tear out excess shade as you are cutting so the knife won't get stuck. It's a very flimsy, extremely sharp tool; be very careful."
3,Insightful,"An interesting read about Graham's life experiences as a privileged Black man in America. I particularly liked his essays about his time at Princeton, his treatment at New York's finest restaurants, and the types of Black people in the workplace. I wonder, though, whether the author was trying to evoke sympathy from his readers with his oh, they treated me badly, I was ignored spiel or whether he genuinely expected to be treated differently because of his status and affluence. Graham's ideas regarding affirmative action and Black leadership were thought-provoking. All in all, a good read about life from the Graham perspective."
2,"Tedious with a clear tone of longing for becoming ""a member""","The author not only wrote the ""book"", he alsobelabored the uninteresting points. Who cares that country clubs arerife with racist, and elitist snobs? Who is sitting at home right now worried about the daily activities that go on in these institutions but the author? Its clear that Graham wants in but his ""negro-ness"" prevents it. What was the purpose of the whole chapter on his nose job? Was it to purge possible guilt with black folks, or was it an attempt at possibly preventing future humiliation should someone else reveal it? To the author I say, ""Who cares about this but you?"". True African-Americans don't waste the precious time given to them on such mundane (not to mention insane)issues."
5,Great U.S. geography game!,We checked this game out of the library and it has such a big hit that it's on the list for Santa. It truly makes learning fun and my daughter begged to play! Very clever way to learn geography and U.S. history.
2,good start and middle but disappointing finish,"it started out an entertaining read and had me laughing out loud at some of the cons' exploits, but the finale was deeply flawed and extremely disappointing - it was as if the author's imagination got tired and he just wrapped it up quickly without thought. And the idea that Dakota would stick around after her part had been played wasn't very bright. To top it off the fairytale nonsense at the end with the boy settles down with girl was too silly for words. I don't know if I'd bother with another book by the same author. I gave it two stars because it had promise."
1,Fell apart,"This thing kept me going for about the first 150 pages,stalled for the next 150 pages, and then completely fell apart at theend. A story like this needs a good villain to make it work. The antagonists here were cartoon characters and way overdone. I didn't believe the payoff for a minute.And don't get me started with all those Hogcreek Bates . . . ridiculous.Oh well. Better luck next time."
4,Well written dialog and plot. Well developed characters.,I enjoyed this book. It was fast paced and entertaining. Very believable characters. Cannell can write great dialog. The language was a bit harsh at some points (due to the mature theme) but not over done like Scarface. I will certainly check out his other works.
1,Disappointed,"I bought one of the shoe cubbys and liked the idea of not seeing the shoes since it is being used in a foyer area. Idea is great the way it is executed is lousy. Anyway the instructions are pretty weak, I am a woodworker so I could figure everything out but easy to assemble is a stretch with the instructions supplied, some things need to be figured out such as the rotating mechanism.Anyway all together and it opens fine without shoes, but put a single pair in it and forget it, the weight causes it to bind on the front. Load it up and it takes a screwdriver to pry it open. I did take the front piece of and re-trim it, but because it is so flimsy it still binds, and now has a bigger gap.The downside that someone else mentioned is forget boots, mid-height shoes and even some tennis shoes, since I have 11 size feet, some won't fit in the small spaces. Now I am looking for another solution, this one will end up in the trash."
4,Shoe Storage,"I bought the shoe storage cabinet to keep in my closet because I had a floor of un-organized shoes. This has worked wonders for my organization skills, and I enjoy it very much."
1,very misleading,This product was a shear disappointment. I think that says it all. The quality was awful (particle board) and it didn't work well enough to hold size 7 womens shoes.
2,My slippers don't even fit!!!,"After spending a considerable amount of time putting this unit together, I discovered that not a single shoe would fit into it!! This is a poor design for people with size 8 mens or smaller shoes only!! My size 10s would not fit."
3,Better then expected. worth watching,"It was predictible, non-original and at times corny. With all this it was better than I thought.You will be entertained as long as you watch it knowjng it isn't Oscar winning."
2,You could have at least offered me some wine with all that cheese.,"Couldn't get into this movie at all. All rules of physics and biology are completely suspended. Granted, the acting is halfway decent, but the effects are pretty pathetic considering how much CG is available these days. The plot had very little to offer and there was absolutely nothing interesting about the characters. Really not worth the time or the money. Perhaps it was originally intended to be a campy spoof, but didn't come off that way to me. I've been pretty impressed with the horror movies the Australians have offered for about the past year and half, but someone really missed the mark with this flick."
3,Worth watching once.,"I bought this movie because I am in love with Phoebe Tonkin and enjoy looking at Cariba Heine. I have watched it twice. It's an Aussie movie so that's a plus for me. However, the special effects are extremely B movie. The computer generated effects are so very obviously fake. I wish they would have had a bigger budget for this movie. The tsunami scene at the beginning is pretty good and every scene with Phoebe is absolute gold. You probably don't have the connection to this movie that I do so you may want to rent it or see if its on Netflix before you pull the trigger to buy it because you may only watch it once. Sorry Phoebs."
1,Don't take the bait!,"The shark is too fake looking. The only good things in this movie are the concept and the body parts. A. shark that look real would gave made all the difference. You'll rent it anyway, so I'll just say this now: ""I told you so."""
3,Decent signs but very lightweight,"LOOK:Signs look exactly like picture, and are bright and visible in the street, and they get the job done. People will notice them and slow down.MATERIAL:They are VERY flimsy/lightweight and will blow over if not secured down by a brick or large rock. They are made of a plastic coated cardboard-like material. There are two pieces that secure together in the middle to form a triangle, and as long as you put a brick in the middle, they wont blow away.Number of SIGNS:There are 2 separate double sided signs in the package, (not sure what happened to that other reviewer who stated that he got only one sign).VALUE:I dont feel that they were worth $27, however I wont be returning them. I could not find these anywhere near me and we need them so that the kids can ride their bikes in front of our house in the street."
2,Disappointing,Nothing new here (as per the NY Times article)...but coming from an individual who lost $7 million (probably much more)the advice rings a little hollow.We can all be Monday morning quarterbacks which is exactly what this book is.Did certainly not stand up to the billing.
2,Watch out for size differences,"The shoes appeared to be made well, but they were quite narrow and my son could not wear them. He used their chart for sizing but it did not fit like a size 10 would in the US."
1,How to love yourself and no one else,"If you're a woman who has been looking for someone to confirm that you should always do only what makes you happy, while not worrying about anyone else, and believes that all men are idiots, this is the book for you!This is the first time that the Flylady has ever steered me wrong. I ordered this book because of a positive comment from her website. I kept reading and reading thinking that it had to improve. It didn't. While there were a few good ideas in the book, I can recommend about 50 relationship books that would be more helpful for anyone.If a man had written this book for men to read, and talked about women as the author talks about men, I'm sure Ms McClary would have been protesting. I personally found it insulting myself, and I am a woman.Save your money."
1,"OK BBQ, crappy company","I've owned this product for just about 5 years now. I generally like the grill, but am disappointed that the rotisserie burner pipe has half-rusted away! I went searching for parts today and learned that Ducane was bought by Weber and they DO NOT HONOR the warranty!! What a bunch of garbage! So much for stainless lifetime warranty to original owner. I searched around for the cheapest place to buy parts and ended up buying from this place: http://www.bbqparts.com/ducane5004SHLPE.htmlTheir parts were cheaper than everyone else I could find and the shipping was reasonable. I hope they are good to deal with."
2,enough is enough!,"For many gay guys, ""The Front Runner"" was the first gay novel they read, we waited for the sequel, ""Harlan's race"", which was great, and now we get ""Billy's boy"", which doesn't stack up. Its OK as a YA novel, which might help a young gay teenager or two, but is pretty boring. No doubt that there will be a part 4, hopefully, this will be a more enjoyable read."
4,My kids love it!,Boys and girls like this game. They get to make their own characters and the characters have to get a job to earn money to buy a home and items they need for their home.For 12 and up.
4,Check your Video/Graphics Card's processor... FIRST !!!,"This is a great game, but like all 3D games, they need powerful graphics chips to run smoothly. The game states that your video processor has to be fully compatible with (DX9) DirectX 9.0, and to be so your video processor really should have been designed for DX9. If you have a Radeon 9500, or GeoForce FX 5200, your OK, but this is the bare minimum for DX9. You'd be better off with a Radeon 9600, or GeoForce FX 5600, or higher/faster. If you don't have one of these processor's be aware your going to spend $100 or more, to buy one!If you don't have the required video processor, the game will not run, and if you have the bare minimum, it will run painfully slow. This is a 5 star game, but I rated it overall 4 stars, because they should have better informed the customer, just how demanding this game really is. Many a customer was surprised to find, they needed a $150 video card, to run this $50 game."
5,Consider This,"If you look at the current price for The Sims 2, you see you have to pay an arm and a leg just to buy it. I suggest that you sell your orginal Sims games and expansion packs before it's too late. You'll get at least some cash back. If you wait untill The Sims 2 comes out, The Sims 1 and all the other expansion packs will be worthless. But if you know anybody that works at Maxis, (Sorry that I am stating the obvious!) ask them if you can play the game for a little while. That way, You can see if it is worth the money you are going to pay. In a couple of months, the price will drop. If you are willing to wait 3 more months, I'm sure you could get it for 29.99."
4,Good,"This is a good game. It took a bit to get use to, being that it's 3-D and stuff. Definitely a big change from the first Sims. You have to learn new cheats. Overall it is fun."
1,What a Lame waste of time,Sims 2 was fun and addicting but is the biggest waist of time on the planet. I mean come on! A game to pretend living!!!! Give me a break! Plus EA leaves out a bunch of cool stuff so that you have to buy the expansion packs. They end up making like 6 to 8 packs to buy. What a rip off!
1,review the game and not the shipping!!!,i was excited to see the game was out so i came to good ol' amazon for reviews only to see 438 reviews about shipping. come on! where's the moderator? how bout a review of the game people!?! you all gave 5 stars to reviews about bad shipping. WAKE UP!
1,Disappointed,We have not gotten a chance to play the game because our computer does not have the adequate software to be able to install the game. Nowhere on the box does it indicate this or in the description before purchasing it. I will never buy another product from this software manufacturer again.
3,"Cool and temtpting, but not ""all that""","The sims 2 is awsome for the first few times u play it. After a while the will get boring. I don't have the expansion packs yet so i don't know what it is like without them. I am totally bored with it now and i feel bad that my mom had 2 pay 50 bucks on the game. Sometimes i will start to play it again, but for now i'm takin' a break. Don't get me wrong i still love the game, but somtimes yall' might want 2 take a break from it."
1,Mac users will have to wait... again.,"I am ready to order The Sims 2, however it is not available for the Macintosh platform at this time. :( Anxiously waiting."
1,ripe off,i was so excited to play the game all week. it was suppose to be my birthday present and the memory reqirments were good for my computer and i get home to play it and it takes up more memory then my computer has period. so i hope target takes it back&gt;
2,Hate is a strong word and...,"Hate is a strong word and I am willing to use it.This game ran SO SO SLOW ITS NOT A BIT FUNNY.I wold not get this game for what i bot it for,that was $53.00."
4,great but one condition...,"Im 10 and LOVE this game but it crashes once in a while. If you buy this (which I recommend you do) and it happens to you every time something important happens like your sim(s) get(s) engaged, married, pegnant, gives birth, etc.( The most amount of babies my sim had was twins), you should save it. Also when something bad happens like your sim gets left at the alter, gets a visit from the grim reaper, etc. all you have to do is go back to the neighborhood WITHOUT saving. Than when you go back into the lot you left off the last time you saved. BUY but beware."
1,Why is this so Great,I got this game wanting the best Sims game ever. What a disappointment. Playing the game makes me feel like this is the first ever Sims game. I think this game sucks. Not waste your money on this game buy the first sims and all the packs that go with that one.The only thing I thought was good on the Sims 2 was creating what your people look like. But other that than the game is not worth it.
3,TOOOOOOOOOOOOo slow,THe other Sims completley bogged down my piece of junk computer but now that the new sims is coming out i get to start all over on my new computer
3,:c(,"I have a brand new computer, and meet all system requirements, but it's just so slow! Slow to load. Slow to animate! The more things going on the slower it gets! I'm so sad! Love sims, but this is way too frustrating and disappointing!"
2,Not bad if you can get it to work!,"My daughter got this for Christmas and we spent hours downloading it at home and we could never get it to start up and play, after doing much troubleshooting with it we found out from their website that we weren't the only ones. Apparently, you have to have a relativily new computer to get it to work, so we had it open and couldn't return it anywhere, we took it to Grandma's house who has a better computer and downloaded it and it will at least turn on there (sometimes). Most of the time, we have to save it every 5 minutes because we don't know at what point it will lock up and have to start over. It takes forever to make a person. But if it worked right (in a perfect world) it would be a great game. It costs alot to take a chance on IF it will work."
5,Still One of the Best,Still one of the best games out there for both teen and adults. However before you buy you should make sure you have better than minimum requirements on your computer. It is a CPU and memory hog and will lag if your system isn't up to snuff.
5,Best thing I bought for 10 bucks!,"Great Game but was expecting an oringal case with the manul but maybe I should have read the description. It dosnt matter though because it plays fine, disk are in perfect condition, and it got here fast. Even though one day shipping is pricey if you really want it fast I sujust 1 or 2 day shipping. 2 day shipping is alot cheaper but I got one day but back to the game. It came in a jewel case and you did ger the 4 disks and the registration key."
2,So much potential . .,"I normally don't write reviews, but this time I felt it was important. The Sims 2 is a GREAT concept, I really enjoy playing the game, but the minimum system requirements listed on the box are completely made up. If you want to be able to enjoy this game, you need at least 512MB of RAM and a GeForce 3 or better or Radeon 7200 or better video card with at least 128MB of RAM. You should also have a fast CPU. 800mhz might work for you, if you don't mind choppy game play and you add in some extra RAM and/or a better video card. Trust me. This game cost me $200 after I did all the necessary hardware upgrades to play it, and my system met their minimum specs before I started."
1,Sims2 PC game,"I'm sure it's a wonderful game over age 13, but it was not compatible on my Windows2000 PC. I could not get the help from my manufacturer to get this game to work. (...). I originally bought it for my 18 year old daughter who is a big fan of the Sims game."
5,counting the days,"I'm jumping ahead and giving this out-of-this-world game 5 stars. I fell in love with the first series, I don't have any doubt the second will be just as successful, if not better. I have been awaiting for this phenomenon of-a-game to arrive, for what seems tooooooooooo long. I'm hoping the producers of maxis doesn't delay the game any further than they have. Cross your fingers everybody that the future release date ends with Aug. 31st. Hopefully, no more delays!!!"
1,This game sucks!,This game is completely stupid it makes no sense at all! If I was you I would not but this game. And for the parents it's also a very inapporitate game. So don't buy this game!
1,When Cheese Turns Into Celery,This game is ruling the world in Australia. It makes me go HURFURRRABOO everyday. U can buy rasbarries and cheese to make buter yay. so as soon as i got this game i was plesently plumper dumperly doo. so yay dont buy this game.
5,"Dude, I'm gonna love it!!!!!!!","Dude, this game is gonna be awesome! I started a money plan so I could buy it with my own money (my mom likes the Sims too, but she just payed 600 bucks for my flute so she won't buy it) I'm saving as if it were 60 bucks. I noticed she raised my allowance, since I started making a plan! The pictures look totally awesome! I have every Sim game so far, and I love 'em all! (I don't really like Bustin' Out) My first experience with it was when I rented it for Gamecube. I loved it. The thing I hated was, I made my family, and my parents died of a fire. *shivers* It was really freaky. Anywho, I can't wait for it to come out!!!! (Graphics look awesome by the way)"
2,Where is the game?,I recently read that the Maxis Development Team was moved from their current location to their new headquarters in ?Redmond?. They were having trouble getting back on the March 2004 Release Schedule due to the move and it appears that this is in fact true if now its been pushed back to June. I've been looking forward to this game since it was first announced. It's sad that it is postponed but I'd rather they release a full working project than to issue a buggy one then a ton of updates and fixes.
5,Perfect Sequel...,"If you liked the original, you WILL like this game. Being a sequel, you should expect it to be very similar with just a few additional features and that is what you get. The new 3D engine takes some CPU power. To run the game ""comfortably"" you need a nice graphics card, something more than 2.0 GHz CPU and at least a half GB of RAM."
2,"Good game,, Good BUGS","Game is great if you can get past the bugs.. I worked 4-5 hours on one house/family, just to find that the dartboard i installed can not be deleted because it is flagged in use when its not... Also many MANY reports of MANY other bugs.. go check out the support forums,, it's a disaster."
4,Sims 2 Is OK but not the best,This Game Is Fun but not the best it has great graphits and great chothes
2,Am I missing something...?,"I had not played the original Sims, but really liked the Sim City franchise and the original Sims was so popular I picked up this latest version. Boy am I dissapointed! This game takes all of the most boring parts of daily life and simulates them in a game. It is unbelievebly boring to manage your Sim while he/she eats, goes to the bathroom, sleeps and bathes which seems like what you spend the majority of the game doing. With some Sims just doing the menial tasks listed above can take most of the Sim day. I dont consider my real life that exciting, but it's much more interesting actually living my daily life than playing this simulated one.I realize that the most of the reviews on here are very positive, but there are so many other games out there that have simulation and strategy themes that are much more interesting."
2,Yet another Bug filled game,I have had this lovely game for a day And it has crashed 10 times so far. My computer Met requirment and exceeds in most areas. Just a bit of caution to all that hasn't recieved theres yet
2,BIG LET DOWN!!!,"I am so shocked that I would actually end up here writing a review to let everyone know that SIMS 2 is no where near the amazing game it was pumped up to be. The only plus is the ability to make characters so very detailed. I am suprised that the view angles weren't as great as they could have been. I found the game to be no more impressive than the original. I was really disappointed by the game overall. I found it harder to work with than the original. This is definately a game I would not suggest to buy. Maybe when the price drops to $19 will it be worth attention. For now, the $50 price tag is way over the value of the game."
5,Sims 2...a must.,"This is a great game...no doubt.Also, I have no clue why people are freaking out because of the fact that your sims can ""woohoo"". You can do this in the earlier versions.So, if it's so gross don't do it. Parents, don't freak out if you don't want your kids to do it just tell them. Don't prevent your kids from this game. People are stupid. It's no big deal. This is a great game and those people are SQUARES.sry lol.Hope this helps"
5,"the sims 2, a great new game!",i think that the sims 2 will be great! Judging by the other 8 sims it will be one of the top games that I or you have played.
5,Its going to be a great game!,"I think this is going to be a great game! It will have lots more animation and options. The sims will be able to do tons more. For example they will be able to have realistic relationships, go to the store to buy food and clothing, die of old age (or get struck by lightning!), go through many stages of life; such as baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and senior. They will also have more of a detailed career; you will have time off (when you have kids or its an important weekend.), unlock a career object, and progress through many more different tracks. The sims will be able to understand what is theirs and what not to touch. you can create very odd people using the Create-A-Sim program (included) The parent sims pass traits and looks down to their young. Nightmares, mean childhood, choices and lots more can shape their life and show who they will become. Over all I think Maxis is doing a wonderful job and I can't wait till its in stores!! :D"
3,Oh........man.........so mature,"I'm 10. I got banned 2 TIMES.1. Weight is not realistic. I mean, can't sims be more fat or buff or bony?2. Styling options are limited.3. Body shop is hard 2 use without GIMP.4. WOOHOOs spoil tween's fun, espiecially with protective parents.So, if you are 9-11 years old, do not buy until 12 and up.By the way, if anyone's a Pokemon game geek, What game should I buy? I have Gameboy. Please reply in Pokemon Sapphire, my place I will bottom-dwell. Thanks! Dear people, don't deny Snape because he fell in love with a foreign exchanged student, who stayed for 1 year. He only has one other one to love, his daughter Massacre, who loves his worst student, Neville Longbottom. Soree, that was random. :-)"
1,the best game eva,sims 2 is the best game eva i luv it so muchyou get to start as a kid and work your wayup. you get mo chices definitley! i lait yo!
3,no problems,i have had no problems with this i just hate that with the prices the way they are now i would have bought a nicer one
5,"Great Price, Great MP3 Player","I bought this player for my husband who wanted a small model (easy to take to work) and had the FM radio. This fit the bill perfectly! Good quality, easy to download songs (no pesky plugs to lose), lightweight. Holds enough songs for his needs and the FM radio has great reception too. He loves it... Now I need to get myself one!"
4,Good value.,"This player is not as intuitive as my Rio but once you get used to it it works well. What I don't like is having to use the included software to load it. It doesn't work with the third party software I use with the RIO. Not sure if that's Creative or the software vendor. My only complaint with the player is that it doesn't come with an armband and instead includes a necklace from which it hangs. That's ok if you're hanging out, but if you are working out or playing sports it bounces off your chest."
1,Errors/Failures After 5x Use,"Sorry that I can't agree with the good reviews posted. I bought this item in late June, and 6 weeks later it showed a fatal error. I had to send it back to Creative at my cost (insured & tracking upon their demand) and received a different replacement model a while later.So far, at least the replacement works ;-)"
1,Worthless unless you are 5,"These are tiny partially filled sacks. Worthless for juggling. To put them under the title of ""worlds best juggling balls"" is a travesty of the English language"
1,No driver for windows vista,"I could not install this camera. I have windows vista in my computer and this camera will not function with it, Went to HP website , installed the driver update they suggested and still it did not work.Any ideas out there"
4,gives peace of mind,"the ladder is long enough for 3 stories and seems to be easy to use. i purchased as a gift for family. hopefully they'll never need it. i esp. like it because it seems more stable and stands well away from the building. think it might have been a little hard to repack after they checked it out though, hence 4 stars."
5,Great product,Price was cheap. I store it in the box in the closet. I reviewed the family on how it fits in the window. It's a one time use item. It seems very sturdy and easy to use.
2,Can't practice with this ladder,"I purchased this ladder after moving into a 3 story townhouse. I had planned on having the family practice using the ladder and then I noticed the ""small print"" conveniently left out of the item description. THIS IS A ONE-USE LADDER!! What a waste of money. I would rather spend a little more and get a ladder which I can practice with in a non-fire situation."
1,Better than the E-Xit Ladder,while this is better than the e-xit ladder it still is junk. web ladders are not as safe as chain ladders
4,quality,"It seems great, except it is a ""one time use only"" so we can't test it out, because it says it may break or hurt someone after the first use. But I feel better knowing we have an alternative if there were a fire. That's what is important."
2,Kidde Three Story Fire Escape Ladder,"All potential consumers need to know this product is a ""one time use only"" ladder. No practice runs allowed. I did not know this when I purchased it and returned it due to that fact. I wanted a ladder we could practice on and have on hand in an emergency."
4,katey1,"Fast efficient service as promised, I cannot rate the product as I hope I will never have to use it but the quality of the products appears first class."
1,TurboTax Installation Problem,"Be advised that if you do not have a designated ""C"" drive or partition on your hard drive, TurboTax 2003 will not install on your computer. The pop-up TurboTax Deluxe setup box appears near the end of installation and states ""Error creating necessary version files."" Then setup suspends. When TurboTax support was queried via their chat facility, they confirmed the problem and had no solution at this time. Subsequent searches in their FAQ area also stated that TurboTax will not install for the same reason as above and instructs the viewer to return Turbo Tax to Intuit for a refund. Nothing like driving your customers to the competition! This also makes Intuit's tag-on programs ""Its Deductible"" and ""Quicken"" useless but there's no mention of what to do with these although, the way they handled this problem, it's pretty obvious what their reply would be.You might want to check this out further if you have a high capacity storage drives that do not contain a ""C"" partition."
1,Unauthorized Debit of Estimated '04 Taxes!,"After filing on the 15th, I waited until today to check my bank account, and I find TWO debits to the IRS! It seems this stupid program decided to authorize an estimated tax payment for '04 without my approval. I spent a few hours today with Intuit, my bank's customer service, the IRS and my local bank branch to try and correct the error. I now have to wait several weeks to get back my money, and will need to withdraw funds from my savings account to avoid being overdrawn. According to the Intuit rep, the problem is apparently not isolated. They even have a web page specifically addressing this glitch (Document #0050002608), although they of course blame the user. This is ripe for a class-action lawsuit!"
3,"Great product, poor rebate process for 2003","Have used for many years -- found solid, reliable and easy to use -- can use the interview process, enter on forms directly or jump between (which I do). They are doing good work on integration with various providers to minimize data entry (e.g., payroll providers, mutual funds, etc.).Would be nice if they allowed you to restep through interview process in a ""read-only"" mode where you look at your entries and wouldn't have to worry that you may impact your tax return.** I would normally give 4 stars or more, but this year they are preventing you from sending rebate submissions via certified mail (probably a cost savings measure) -- what a way to irritate clients -- just imagine trying to explain to them one of your rebate submissions were lost in the mail in the middle of tax season. **"
1,Proved inadequate 2 tax years ago,"The last version of TurboTax I actually owned and used was either 1999 or 2000. When I tried to install the year that followed, the installation failed because my home PC software was too old. TaxCut, on the other hand, didn't care, so I've been using TaxCut on my Windows 95 - Internet Explorer 4.0 system ever since. If your system is more current than mine, TurboTax may suit you perfectly."
4,TurboTax seems good to me,"I only used Turbo Tax Premier Web version and that seems very good to me. The only issue here is that it allows only one state while I need to file 2 states. Since there Web version is so good I can't believe that desktop version is not good as I heard that it is similar interface there. I think one need not worry about rebates etc in Web Version. If one have to file just Federal + 1 state, I highly recommend this product."
1,Bad Marketing Policies,"I have been using TurboTax and TurboTax Deluxe for 7 years very happily until today. I just installed TurboTax Deluxe for 2003 and aside from the plethora of advertisements I discovered that it does not walk me through Schedule D for capital gains anymore. In order to have that feature, I should have bought TurboTax Premiere at a higher price. Their products for the most part are very good, once the bugs are worked out of them. BUT, their marketing policies are very bad. First the rebate stuff, which I detest, and now having to upgrade to a more expensive version for features which were always included. No more Intuit products for me, sadly. I am now forced into using other vendors' products. This product would be fine for users who don't have entries on Schedule D."
1,Turbotax 2003 - good riddance,"Both Turbotax and Quicken get worse every year. Then last year they piled the DRM C-Dilla Spyware on us, and I fortunately moved to Taxcut. Now, Taxcut has a number of quirks, and Turbotax has an edge on a few things, like calculating employee stock purchase plan sales, etc. If you sold ESPP shares in 03, Turbotax is probably better for you...For almost anything else, Taxcut can handle it quite as well, although they could take a bit better guidance of the user, TT is still ahead of these. But, TT is working more on DRM and service tie-ins than quality of actual product, and their customer service, so Taxcut is a promising alternative..."
2,My confidence in TurboTax has been shattered,"I just happened to look at the computation that TurboTax Deluxe 2003 did for a stock contribution and discovered that they are using the wrong value for the contributed stock (the basis price rather than the FMV on date of transfer). This could cost me about $1000. Worse yet, it DID cost me about that much last year. (Guess I'll have to file an amended return.)Up to this point I had assumed that the computations that TurboTax did were reliable, but now I guess I'll have to check everything, greatly reducing the value of the product.It's still a worthwhile product, but I'm no longer a ""guaranteed"" customer for next year."
1,Don't buy it!!,"I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years. After unsuccessfully trying to use it this year, I will never buy it again. The updates aren't availabe for downloading, to print your forms, you have to download the fonts, to talk to customer service/technical help they put you on hold for over a hour and not helpful at all. Turbo Tax uses Outsourcing as everyone I did manage to talk to are in India. The whole program is useless. They have lost another customer."
2,Much too Verbose,"I think I'm getting sick of reading books from Humanities folks, they are also far too verbose. This book is not an exception. This book could have been much shorter if the author stopped repeating himself and wrote in a less verbose style.There are a few interesting tidbits of information in the book, but overall its not worth reading."
4,"Great for 3 yr. olds, not 2yr. olds",I read the reviews of this product and purchased the Alphabet Apple for my toddler based on these. Although I think it is a great educational toy and virtually indistructable it definitely isn't terribly useful or helpful for a 2 year old as you claimed. The correct manufacturer age is for 3 yrs. old and up not 2 yrs. as you stated. If the info you provided was correct I probably would have waited a year to get this toy. I think others would too. Otherwise it is a great learning tool.
5,Surf music from Texas !!!!,"Mike Vernon is pretty unique. His sound and compositions are very creative. It's surf music like no other surf music. Between Ry Cooder, Dick Dale and Ennio Morricone ... Check it out !"
1,Received the older version with the red light,"I saw that the same thing happened to at least one other person before I ordered, but I figured Amazon would have gotten this sorted out by now. Apparently not. I was sent one of the older versions that has a useless red light, instead of one with the brighter white light."
3,Numerous errors in the book and it starts out confusing,"I got the book today and found it uses some weird syntax. For example the author uses echo_ instead of echo, etc. This happens numerous times in the book.I also wouldn't call this book for people who have no knowledge of php. This does not introduce the basic concepts of the language well like for example the tags in php. All the author says is thats how scripts start. Other books gave me paragraphs why they have those tags. This book though is good for a beginner but has had some experience with the language."
2,PHP5 for Dummies,This book is rather outdated because it was written in 2004. There are some good parts but some of the resources mentioned in the book are no longer available. The author's website is not helpful either because scripts that she says are available on her website are not available. Overall assessment is that it is somewhat helpful but outdated.
1,never recieved it,"I never recieved this item, so I couldn't tell you of the product specifically, but the seller / shipping is not good it appears?"
1,Stand Alone Freehand Only,"WARNING: The Adobe website states that this upgrade is eligible from any version of Freehand - NOT TRUE. You can not use this with any bundled version of Freehand, stand alone ONLY! Since Freehand was frequently bundled, BUYER BEWARE!"
4,Good Basic Reference,This text is a good basic reference for the beginning nurse researcher. It has very clear explanations of the research process and applies them nicely to the clinical setting.
2,poor,Book is defunct missing - it goes from 214 to 231 through 238 then repeats 231 onward again. Also CD rom is missing. The book is essential for my learning and was costlyEmailed the dealer requesting a new book but they want me to remove poor review and send damaged book. By Faith I bought this book online and I am not receiving the same courtesyI want a new book then I will return the old
3,"A bit dated, but great soul-jazz album","The instrumentation just makes it clear it's a '90's album. But my local ""Smooth Jazz"" album plays the cover of E, W & F every so often.Great soul-jazz, light and uplifting. Thank you."
3,Not useful for non-English speakers,"I was looking for flash cards for non-English speakers. Neither this nor its sister companion are it. I need to be able to teach ""hate,"" not ""abhor."" Given the frequency of ESL words on the product page at Amazon, I ordered it. My mistake.It might be good for SAT prep, or for a teen with a three word adjective vocabulary (awesome, cool, sucks)."
4,Great for the Hard-Core Floyd fans!,"I thought the book was great for a harder based floyd fan, which I am. I can possibly see where a more casual fan would find some of the information tedious. If you are looking for a true biography you should check out ""A Saucerful of Secrets"" by Nicholas Schaffner. That was phenomenal, but if you've read that and were still compelled for more Floyd info, I highly recommend giving this one a try!"
4,"Updates a pain, but TurboTax did its job","I didn't have a problem using TurboTax last year (even with the software activation) so I used it again this year. The software with its interview format worked for me, was able to save my return as pdf and e-file without a hassle. The only real pain was getting the updates. I had to go to Intuit's website to look for info and play around with my broadband connection to get the updates to download.My return has gotten easier over the past few years but with the update annoyance, I may just buy TaxCut next year. I don't import last year's stuff so Intuit - give me a reason to get TurboTax 2004."
3,Disappointment,I simply want to download software onto my desktop and not have to remain on line for hours(costing $$'s) and this year that option isn't avialable...will look to use different software program...software that can be downloaded.....extremely disappointed have used turbo tax for many many years. I will not put my tax information on the web!!!
5,9 year old son loves it!,"My 9 year old son loves this game. Similar directions to the basic Risk game but, great for Star Wars fans. We play it as a traditional board game but, he also enjoys just playing with all the figures and setting up Star Wars battles. Shipping was great - used regular shipping and received it in 2 or 3 days."
5,"A must have for the ""well versed"" Williams fan.","Great book by John Underwood!Those familiar with many Ted Williams books and articles will recognize some of the stories in the book, but anything with Ted talking ""off the cuff"" is great. The CD recording included with the book of Ted giving his opinions, experiences and thoughts is priceless! Mr. Underwood, if you read this you should release all of your Williams recordings on CD. I guarentee they'd be very popular!!This should not be the first Ted Williams book you read. I suggest ""My Turn at Bat"" also by Underwood or ""Ted Williams: An American Hero."" by Leigh Montville as your first Williams read."
1,Too many false alarms,"I bought four for four different flows. It was ok for 3-4 years. But now, it is paste it's warranty period.Slowly each alarm eventually started giving false alarms, and chirps. In addition, it is extremely sensitive. Cannot really cook without it going off. It is not to a point that I have to replace all of them.definitely would not recommend this."
2,"Errors, errors, errors...","Disappointing Forta release. Not much different than the last versions. Save the $35 and stick with the last MX version.Rush job, indeed. Copy editor anyone??"
3,No Macintosh Support,This book is not suitable for those on a Macintosh platform. The concepts are not really the same.
3,Not what I was expecting...,"I bought this book to learn Coldfusion to maintain websites at work. I know various other dynamic web languages(php,asp,.net) but not CF. If you are a web developer/programmer already, this book will bore you to tears. Based on what I have seen, Coldfusion is not a great language to write in, if you know any others. And if you don't know any others programming languages... learn them instead."

2,Which fly do I use,"I found this book to be disappointing. Really nothing new, just a rehash and not specific as to what fly rig to use in specific situations . There are better choices..John A. Kinsfather"
1,worthless and downright dangerous spout,"Bottom Line Up Front, the spout is useless and EASILY breaks.The concept is nonsense, other reviewers have detailed how you have to hold this 35 pound can (when filled), balance it while refueling, and catch the lip to press down to open it.You will spill A LOT of gas, it is just unavoidable. It drains SLOWLY, and frankly I'm getting older. I was damn tired after draining one can. I was exhausted after twoThe fact that the can itself is ventless makes it worse. The spring loaded spout will also break, again unavoidable. You will replace the spout and you will probably need a funnel and an extra pair of hands if you don't.I miss Blitz cans, they were the best. The idiots who wrongly sued Blitz out of existance should be suing the moron that came up with this CARB compliant design.Dangerous and frustrating to use. Where do I sign up for the inevitable class action law suits."
1,One star is giving it too much credit!,"The worst design EVER. Literally do not buy if you want to save yourself a lot of actual headaches.I bought 2 after Sandy and hate them. The spout is super complicated to use and seal. The instructions on the container are not clear and are written in tiny script. (If you need instructions on spouts, it's too complicated!) I had to go online to their website to fully understand how to keep it sealed because the containers kept leaking.Even after reading and sealing it according to their instructions, I routinely found spontaneous leaks and the gas smells permeated my entire house and gave me constant headaches. I have had to put the containers outside and opened all my doors/windows. I am going to get rid of these containers because they are not worth the actual headaches I've been getting.I would have given it a zero if possible!"
1,Less than one star.,"If I could give this product a negative rating I would. It's awkward to use, leaks terribly, splashes gas all over, has no vent hole, and is shaped so that it's difficult to drain. Even getting the safety catch to depress and stay open is difficult. It leaks all over my hands and whatever I'm filling it with. DO NOT BUY THIS GAS CAN!!!"
5,educational and fascinating!,"This Uncle Milton Giant Ant farm is the prfect size...big enough to really see the ants at work . Ordered the ants online and came exactly one week... inserting the sand and ants was easy but sand is messy..do it in the garage and make sure to place the ants in the frig for about 15 mins to decrease their activity. 20% of ants arrived dead but the rest are alive, active and large . Its been almost two weeks and my 2 kids, age 5 and 7 and husband have been enjoying seeing how the ants work together and all the diferent kinds of tunneling and food gathering they are doing in the farm house. Very fascinating and would recommend Uncle Miltons Giant ant farm to anyone. No regrets!"
2,It was ok,It was ok. The sand didn't do what it was supposed to. I think I should have gotten gel. My son quickly lost interest.
2,Uncl Milton ant farm,I was disappointed that we had to wait almost two weeks for the ants. and when we got them only two out of 30 were alive.
2,Doesn't seem very safe,"This highchair is very easy to put togather and looks great online but I was disapointed after I put it all togather. First of all the fabric cover just basically sit on the chair. The only thing holding it in place are the buckles going through it and a lip of fabric on the top that goes over the back of the chair a few inches. So food and what not could very easily fall between. Also the tray was not as sturdy as I would have liked, even pushed all the way to the chest it still wobbled. I think the thing that made me really uneasy about the chair was the plastic peice that goes between the legs, it very easily popped out of its place. It's not as if my child could have slipped out of the chair because of it but she could VERY easily get her leg pinched by it. When I first was looking for baby things I was mostly going by what things looked like, but after this experience I have re-evaluated my baby equipment. Quality is DEFENETLY more important."
5,Old School Goodness,This is really an excellent figure for the money. It is well sculpted and all the pieces fit very well together. You definitely can't go wrong adding this figure to yoour Batman collection.
3,Great Help with Sun's Free Compiler,"I have a working knowledge of both C and C++ programming languages through my studies of engineering. Wanting to learn JAVA as it seems to be the up and coming language desired by potential employers, I have tried may other books. Though these books seemed better than this book for first time users, they didn't give much help in using the free JAVA compiler JDK1.2 offered by Sun Microsystems. This including manuals published by Sun itself. I stumbled upon this book costing 1/3 to 1/4 the cost of the other manuals and was impressed at the help it gives in using JDK1.2. I would recomend this book to thoughs for if nothing else but to get JDK1.2 to run correctly. If your just beginning programming though, it may be to fast and brief."
1,Waste of Money,"I thought I had finally found the perfect toy for my year old very heavy chewing 65 lbs. boxer/pit. It looked heavy duty, fun, and entertaining. And he absolultely LOVED it! He loved to chase it wherever it bouced and throw it into the air (careful though, it is heavy and could hurt) He'd bat it around like a kitten and pounce on it when we rolled it. It took him only a few days to destroy one of the parts though. And now it is up with all the other toys he has destroyed. We will be trying a Kong next and see how that goes. If you have a heavy chewer, this is not the toy for your dog but if not, would be a great toy."
1,not for power chewers!!!!!!!!!!,"Bought this in a pet store for my 40lb pit mix.....ten minutes into play as we were working around the house he had a leg and a half of this toy ripped off with lots of tears on the rest of the toy. Dont waste the money or risk your dogs health with this toy, because we all know you cant always suppervise there play."
2,Not that great,"We ordered this online through Target. Not only did Target charge my credit card twice, but the product came defective.The speakers were blown out and the pixals were not that great.I am giving a two star rating based on the pixals. Sometimes there were 2 inch chuncks of defective pixals on the screen. They would come and go but it was very annoying. I am returning this TV for an Emerson from Walmart."
1,Malfunctioning after three years,"My 537H television worked fine for about three years and then started to malfunction. It turns itself off two or three times a day, and it won't turn back on unless it is unplugged and then plugged in again. My reading on the internet has revealed that Olevia TVs have power-supply problems, and that's what this would seem to be. Some Olevia TVs turn themselves off and then won't come back on again."
2,Do not buy this tv,"Don't buy a Syntax Olevia! I bought one and it died almost a week befoire the warranty expired i had to pay $90.00 for shipping , they sent me another unit , so i decided to buy 3 year warranty. the tv broke down one more year later called, they will fix but i have to pay another $100.00 to ship back to the company and wait about a month to get unit back. even i paid for extended warranty on this unit and it should be repaired in my house FYI the warranty was sold to me from oleiva it self."
3,Decent TV for the price,"We've had this TV for just over 4 years, and have been quite satisfied until this week, when the close captioning quit working. Dish told us that it's a TV issue and gave us a toll free number to call. The message at that number says that support is no longer available - sorry. I guess it's good to have an excuse to upgrade your TV every few years, and except for the close captioning it still works fine. For the price, which is quite a bit lower now, it's not a bad TV, but I'm not sure I would buy it again today. In fact, I'm here on Amazon looking for another one."
5,2006 Hummer H3,"Bought my H3 used in 2011, and i'm guessing the vehicle went through significant offroading because the front 2 ignition coils were corroded beyond belief, i had trouble beliving that they were actually working properly! But the product is straightforward, OEM equipment.. Worked flawlessly, swapped my spark plugs at the same time so i did notice a performance gain.. but let me re-iterate, my old coils were corroded beyond belief. Great product."
1,Can they get any worse...,"I have read ( and still own ) every DESTROYER book back to Volume one. But these horrible things are just becoming painful to read.(I can accept some stretch of reality, but this one was just as stupid as the recent book about the weak and blind mole people who could attack, defeat and abduct healthy humans)The plot was ridiculous.... what's with the psychic Squids and the T-1000 rip-off character?.These are turning into cheesy sci-fi and not action-adventure. I have one more to read and if it doesn't show potential for improvement I may have to give up completely on the DESTROYER series.BTW. Have someone run a grammer/spell check. They're and There along with Your and You're are NOT interchangeable."
4,World music - folk rock from the middle east,"If you are looking for music similar to ""Dead can dance"" with real words this album is it, but the more traditional instrumented tracks are more moving."
3,A worthy effort,"I ordered this album mainly on the couple of tracks I heard on public radio. The rest of the album is OK, and her voice is absolutely beautiful. The recording is also superb -- this is one of the best-sounding CDs I have ever bought. However, the arrangements and melodies reminded me too much of Tori Amos or something like that, and though I respect Tori, she's not really my thing. Also, many of the tracks seemed too much like one another. Fans of Tori or people who like Celtic-type music will probably love this album.I would be willing to check out other works by Azam Ali. This one was not really what I was looking for."
5,disposal cord,"Makes hooking up and servicing the disposal a lot easier, convenient length ,about 36 inches ,that includes a romex connector ( stain relief)."
3,Not long enough,"When using this power cord and putting in a power switch, this cord simply is not long enough. I had to replace mine with a power cord I bought at Lowes"
5,Melfa Has Mastered the Fundamentals,"As with any discipline, mastery of the fundamentals yields results. Melfa has mastered the fundamentals of bodybuilding. And, more importantly, he has mastered the art of instruction. This book is not about motivation. It's about demonstration. If you want to build a strong foundation and see results fast, this is your book. From eating to exercise, Frank Melfa tells you and shows you exactly what you need to do to build muscle and feel great!"
3,"Its ok,","I bought this book thinking there would be some twin things inside the book, like sharing experiences, ect.. and there wasnt anything at all. I thought for the price, it would be better. You basicly got 2 of the same book. Would have been cheaper to buy 2 seperate book. The case it comes in is nice though."
2,not made well for the money,"I bought this set a year and a half ago when I was expecting my first child. I found it to be a unique and more sophisticated bedset compared to the more common cutesie cartoon types out there. Upon receiving the set, I was fairly impressed. It seemed to be well made, until I washed it. I am under the assumption that most parents expecting an infant like to wash everything before they use it. Well, out of the washer and dryer it came. The seems on the bumper in several places had come undone and the ribbon edge on the comforter shrunk so it looks all bunched up in the middle. Also the fitted sheet that comes with the set looks like a piece of .99 cent muslin you would by at the craft store. If those things wouldn't bother you I guess it would be okay. As for me, now that I am expecting another child, I will purchase another set."
2,Quit smoking,"If you want to quit smoking. Then buy this pipe. Hard to clean,draw on, keep lit, and be sure you have something arround that you can drain the juice on that is in the bowl. Looks nice but functions very poorly."
1,Famine Denial,"To deny that the Ukrainian Famine ever occured is the same as denying that the Jewish Holocaust ever occured. This book is only good to line the bottom of bird cages. Douglas Tottle is nothing but a racist, the same as Ernst Zudel."
3,An Introduction To Enterprise Architecture: Second Edition,Interessant book and base of the course for the certification of Enterprise Architect (Carnegie Mellon)
1,do not buy this broiler pan,"I have had two of these broiler pans withen a two year period, 1 year of this period I used a standard broiler pan that came with the oven I was using. The first of the two pans that were perchased started to lose its no stick coating after 2-3 uses. I continued to use the pan untill I could stand it no more. Not only does the non stick coating chip off but it also looses effectiveness after each use. The second pan I only used for a short period of time because, like I said before I was using a standard pan. Now I have moved into an apartment where I needed a broiler pan, I think I have used it 3 times since moving in and the same thing is hapening. I am only writing this because I came online to look for another broiler pan and I just happend to see this ad........"
2,"Not ""tuffy""nough","I'll get straight to the point. My 1 yr old Goldendoodle had the stuffing ripped out in about 2 hours. We initially had some great tug of war and fetch going on and she really loved it. She lost interest (as a puppy will) and I left the toy on the floor. I came back about a half-hour later to discover she'd chewed through the middle and had ripped out all the stuffing.People may have different experiences as she is a bit of a destroyer. She even managed to destroy one of the KONG. Dental Dog toys and one of the KONG Frisbees.If anyone else has similar destroyers I can only recommend the original KONG. 10 months of continues play, including cage time, it only shows a couple teeth mark here and there."
2,Do not waste your money!,This is a story about the band which would be fine except that about half of the facts are fiction and most of what the woman with a very heavy English accent says on this CD is speculation. I don't even think she did any research before recording this. Waste of time and money :-(
1,Disgust,"This book has to be the worst music-bio ever penned. I naively thought this would be a nice quick read to get some insight into one of the most creative and unique bands of all time. Sucker!The author's nauseating narrative smacks of an 11 year-old's first attempt at creative writing. The background research appears to have consisted of a brief internet search combined with copius plagiarism. Worst of all, the author seems to have great (and unarticulated) disdain for his subject(s). He even results to fat jokes.For the love of all that's holy, do not buy this waste of trees."
3,too small or too large,"Look great and seem well made but 11 is too tight and 12 is very loose and both flex outward in the middle on both sides of each foot; they are made very narrow. If they fit, they seemingly would have been great."
4,"""Dame Shirley"" as a Gold Rush Source","Jim Rawls's book is a wonderful resource for children to study the reality of the typical mining town from heyday to ghost town. It includes a general description of the hardships endured by the miners as well as several examples of the effects of prejudice (and too much whiskey!) on the many ""foreign"" miners. I would have liked to see a few more direct quotes from the Dame Shirley letters, but the information is given using age-appropriate language and length. Definitely worth the time to read."
3,Good start but only a third done,"The book was a good start on phrases and meanings, but it was only a third as long as it should have been. The material was fine, but just too short. Had the book been regular sized, it probably would have been about 4 pages."
5,Super,This book was a tremendous help in identifying plants for my Botany class. The pictures are clear and accurate. I would recommend buying for any plant course!
5,Great,I bought this book to compliment my lab manual from a different publisher. I liked this one much better than the manual that we were required to have as the pictures were much easier to study and the ease at which I could look up different phyla of plants made this book a five star in my mind.
4,nice,"this is a great book. It has a variety of pictures and valuable information you wouldn't get almost anywhere else. If you have trouble finding information about the gupta empire, u need this book."
3,"A useful resource, but why buy the book?","This book is the best (and, admittedly, the only) guide to electronic music I have ever seen in book form. However, all the information in this book is also available for free at allmusic.com. Since the website is updated and hypertextually cross-referenced, the book is actually a somewhat less useful format, albeit more convenient in some ways. Of course, buying it does give money to the people who thought to create such an exceptionally useful resource."
1,Good and bad news,"I got the same model but different color and they are great. But when ordered the black ones, BAD news! The size doesn't match. I got the 10.5 just like the Olive ones that I got and surprise!! They didn't fit me. Does the black dye make shoes shrink? hmmmmmm, just dissapointed"
4,Better than expected,"I'd been having lots of radio static after getting a new glass mount antenna, however, after installing the XTERMINATOR, I was pleased to find that most of the static was eliminated. It didn't completely solve my problem, but my radio has gone from unbearable to listenable, so no complaints there.It's easy to install, doesn't require a power source, only took a couple days to arrive, and pretty cheap. So overall, I'm very happy with this product, and it has performed much better than anticipated."
2,Terrible,"I have had this for less than one month and already there have been two leaks, one very obvious leak on the top pattern that caved in, and one I have yet to find. I end up on the floor after a mere 30 minutes of sleeping on it. Definitely not worth the price and not worth the frustration!"
3,It's cobalt,I needed a Cobalt blue butter dish. This is kind of Old World. Klunky looking but it will do fine.
1,Corrosion = Fail,"I bought 5 different sets of license plate fasteners due to mixed reviews and didn't want to go through the hassle of changing out the plate later.1) The product received was as described (packaging had the Cruiser Accessories 80230 Fasteners, Domestic-Steel labeling on it)2) These are steel, as stated in the descriptionI did a rudimentary corrosion test by half-submerging them in salt/water for 24 hrs then rinsing them off and letting them sit for another 24 hrsOf the 5 packs, this is the only one that started to corrode.Each of the others were similarly shaped and priced"
5,In constant use,"I sort of followed the instructions for seasoning, I think the most important step in early use is to oil and heat the wok after washing to get off all the water and to help build up the patina. After two months of almost constant use it's developed a black shiny nonstick surface that can be wiped clean with a paper towel or if anything sticks simply putting some water in it and lightly swirling a sponge around will get it clean.This is the perfect pan for cooking over high heat.UPDATE Feb 2009: This is still the pan I use the most, along with my 100-year-old cast iron skillet. You really want a good large source of heat to use this thing (I have a Bluestar rangetop) because it transfers the heat directly and doesn't spread it around. But if you have that, then this is great. Mine doesn't have the hammer marks like in the photo."
2,As sparse as the desert landscape...,"I am about to make a move to Arizona, and I thought this book might help ease the transition. I was disappointed to find that the book covers a lot - but nothing in enough detail to be helpful. The information on weather, employment, and useful phone numbers, etc. can be found on the Arizona state website for free. I suppose if you have no other resources available, this book might be useful, but I was disappointed."
4,"This is a mat, not an airbed","I think too many people are expecting a 6"" air bed with the built in pump. This is a mat used for backpacking/light camping. It is mainly used to provide some insulation between your sleeping bag and the ground, not to be as comfortable as your bed at home.Mine worked fine, and inflated to the expected 3/4""- 1"" thickness."
2,works if you inflate it,bought this and i am taking it back. It did not inflate but if you your self blow into it and inflate it it is great but other wise it does not inflate at all. Don't buy spend the extra money and get something good.
1,falsely claims to be self-inflating,"The packaging claimed that this was self-inflating, but it was NOT. You'll get light-headed inflating it.It was too narrow for me. I got it so I could crash on the floor when I'm not at home, but it too narrow to be useful. It was also uncomfortable.Get something else.The only-thing self-inflating about this mat was the bogus advertizing on the outside of the box."
4,Works as described but needs a strong light source behind it to view at night,"The backlit clock on my Hondas dashboard went out, so I purchased this Type S clock so I could know the time at night. It works OK for this application, but there needs to be some backlight coming through the clear face in order to see the LCD display at night. I first had it mounted high on my windsheild (near the rear view mirror), but there wasn't enough light there to see the time. Now it's located low on the windsheild (just above the wiper blades), and when the headlights are on, enough light comes through for visibilty. Works OK, but it's still a bit hard to see. Works fine in daylight."
2,great if you a running a day care center,"unless you are working with a lot of children, I don't see any other need for 100 cookie cutters. Just more junk in the kitchen. Look exciting for children to cut cookies for a day care party."
5,"Excellent CD, needs more recognition","Bob Hillman's debut is an eclectic mix of folk and indie music. He's got a wonderful voice, brilliant lyrics, and wonderful musical talent. And, look at the guy. Way better looking than any member of a boy band."
2,"Elegant Baby Colorful Enamel Animal Photo Album Holds 4"" X 6"" Photos","The item is not what I expected in terms of quality. The front part of the album is nice and sturdy, but the spine and back cover are really cheap cardboard.I would recommend not buying this."
5,Could not put it down,"Got the book at 2:00PM and finished at bedtime.Could not put this smartly written page turner down.Fools Rush In, reminds us of the dynamic culture in which we live and the trade offs some people in business,professions,the arts,clergy,and lay make with their principles, time and ,in fact,their very lives.I worked for TIME INC. many years ago before the mergers and recall those good old days with great affection. Let us hope for the sake of the stockholders,employees,and all others associated with this stalwart American Corp. that the good new days are right around the corner.Onward!"
4,Great stuff,"This is a great reference book for any racing enthusiast. It is not really the type of book that you can sit down and read cover to cover, but rather allows the reader to consult a number of topics in the order that they choose. It is an excellent source for the fundamentals of advanced racing (if that makes any sense). Reads very easily, but there is a lot of stuff in here to absorb. I highly recommend this, it should be in every racer's home library."
4,not too bad,I found this cd-rom to very informative of the architectural world. Morposis is a very intersting firm with very intriguing designs and projects. I look forward to seeing more of Morphosis's work.
4,Funny and illuminating travelogue,"I have to admit that I have a soft spot for the author due to some shared experiences (mixed Irish-English family in Warrington). Altough this isn't as funny and consistent as McCarthy's Bar it's still a great read- each time I sit down with it I chuckle out loud a few times (which gets me some strange looks on public transport). At the same time he has done his homework on the places he goes and their history, so not only does the reader end up amused but also a little bit more educated. Strongly recommended with a (not-super-chilled) pint of Guinness or a neat Jamesons."
2,Did not support my lower back,"I found this band a bit cumbersome to put on and adjust working with the 2 velcro straps. Once on and adjusted to a snug fit, I felt no support or relief in my lower back. I did purchase according to my waist size so I am not sure if it is just poor product design or something I did wrong. I have had good luck with other Futuro products for the knees and wrist but unfortuntately, this product did not work for me and I returned it."
4,This ain't too shabby.,"This won't make a Johnny Smith, or Django Reinhardt of you but it sure should make you better. Unless you are a total loss it should make you think and expand your improvisation. Set up the CD in a repeat mode and go for it. You really don't want to play the same tired lick 35 times in a row do you? I think these are well worth the cost. (NOTHING gets 5 stars from me but my wife!)"
1,Boring...,"I kept reading this little book hoping upon hope that it would get better - it never did. It's written for children, I do believe, certainly not for adults."
5,The most important book on Christianity in the past 20 years,"Jacob Needleman has had the courage to re-examine the most basic assumptions about what Jesus intended to communicate, and he does so by sharing the most deeply held thoughts of several extraordinary Christian thinkers today. ""All real religion produces results,"" Needleman writes, and the inability of many of the modern organized Christian churches to do that -- to transform the thought and lives of believers as radically as primitive Christianity did -- reflects the spiritual atrophy that only a rigorous re-thinking of the original Christian ideas can correct. This book can spark your own part in that re-thinking..."
1,"Nutrition For Dummies, Pocket Edition",I was dissapointed that more than 50% of the original book was left out. I purchased it as a referance. There was no indication that this was a reduced version when I ordered it.
3,Good book on Nutrition,"Did the author really needed a whole chapter on alchohol? I thought some of the infomation in this book was talked about a little too much like about how our food is digested or what to do when eating out at a resturant or at a fast food joint. What I liked about the book was it was very laid out and easy to read. Some of the infomation the book mentions are the basics of nutrition, how much nutrition you need, what types of vitamins and minerals are there."
2,not what i wanted,"I was hoping for a book that would help me put together menus with the best nutrition information. this one just didn't do that for me. instead it had the same old tired and conflicting information as the other books or magazines. plus, this one spent way too much time on the digestive process. most of us already know that or just don't care."
4,Great for Camping,"This bed would be great for camping. I have a rechargable Aero when they first came out and did not let the battery fully drain before recharging. The result is the charger did not keep a charge for long. When I called Customer service,they said, they were sorry, but the instructions state you have to make sure the battery is drained before recharging or else you will diminish the life of the charge. This battery option seems to be logical, except D batteries can be kind of expensive if you use it for sleepovers over friends homes all summer. I share this story because I did not appreciate the way Aerobed Customer Service handled my problem, which is a reflection on the company and the products they sell."
1,Leaks!,"This bed is confortable when it works. Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long.After about a week, the power supply used to charge the inflator died. That was replaced with a power supply from Radio Shack.By the two month mark, it was obvious that the bed was losing air. First slowly and, within a week or so, it could only hold air for an about an hour.Looking over other Aero bed reviews, it is obvious that the valves have major design problems. I wish I had read those reviews before making this purchase.The solution seems simple: stick with a traditional bed. These air mattresses are just expensive toys."
4,Great for the price...,"Even though this product seems a little outdated in its appearance, I have been pleased with it. It was good for the price. I use it in the vehice and when I am in my apartment. It frees up my hands to drive and also to multi-task at home. Some of the reviews complain of not hearing on it very well. That was a concern of mine when I bought it, but I haven't had much trouble with the hearing it at all. There have been only a few times. Other than that, it fits on the ear pretty well (although this is my first bluetooth product). Overall, I have been pleased."
2,Just an ok headset,"I bought this headset about a month ago. After I used it for couple times, I find it lacks lots of good features. 1) It doesn't have automatically re-connect feature after the BT connection is lost with the phone. You have to go through the hassel to reestablish the link. 2) no mute function which is a must feature for business. 3) If you put in the pocket, you could easily hit the re-dial button.Instead of this, I would highly recommend the scala-500 which is the best BT headset I have used. Purchase from CompUSA for $10. Much better model."
3,Don't use this for recording,"My first Motorola HS815 was great. I used it to record my weekly podcasts by phone. Then, my editor started noticing static and said I soundly like I was in a barrel. I don't know what happened but I assumed it was this bluetooth since I had also started experiencing static when chatting on non-recorded calls. I bought a new one of this same model. It is no better than the first one. It could be my phone, but the phone works fine (no static) when I'm not using the HS815. Just thought I would mention it in case you are planning to use this device for recorded phone calls."
3,Battery life is too short,I am on my second sensor. The first one only lasted 10 months. Nike will charge $20.00 for a replacement and $10.00 to ship it to you. Thats the same price a complete new unit. Too bad for us music lovers.
4,Great Partner,"Excellent way to keep yourself motivated. It is so easy to update your runs to the nike.com website and see how you have progressed. As far as accuracy is concerned, it is fine. It may be a little off, but then again, it isn't a GPS device. If it was it would cost more than the $30 or whatever you paid for it. I don't wear Nike shoes and I suggest the Mareware Sportsuit.Apple 2 GB iPod Nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (2nd Generation)MARWARE Nano (1G/2G) Wrist/Armband Protective Sportsuit Relay Sensor+ pouch for Nike + iPod Sport Kit"
2,Long term reliability issues.,"I like most of these reviewers thought this device was the best thing ever, I could live with the slight error in distance calculations, but the reason I only give this device 2 stars and I send this word of warning to all is after about 6 months these devices start having problems (check the Nike+ Q & A section as I am not alone)You will be out for a run or walk and the device will end your workout without your input. I have changed sensors, receivers and even the Nano I use it on and still the problem continues, I am unsure of the reason, but am disappointed with all the complaints that Nike is receiving something is not being done. Good luck and run long."
4,Ipod sport kit for Ipod nano,"I'm a semi-avid runner, and was curious about this item, as I always run with music from my nano attached to my waist band. I've found this item to work great, right out of the box. With one exception! If you are an avid treadmill runner, you'll find that the mileage and calories burned calculated by the treadmill doesn't jive with the mileage and distance run according to the Ipod+Nike sport kit. You will however find yourself motivated to run further, and get yourself synced up with Nike's website. Set goals, se how you run, challenge yourself. I personally think the Ipod sensor is more accurate than the treadmill (but don't tell my wife that). I would recommend this kit."
4,Excellent Read,"An Excellent Account of the herioic actions of The Houston either largely unknown or forgotten being overshadowed by the Events at Pearl Harbor. I had no Idea about the story and fate of the Houston (nor did anyone else other than the survivors until the end of the War) a book of two parts, the second larger portion being devoted to the stories of the survivors and the horrific ordeals suffered at the hands of their captors on the Burma Railroad"". So many Poignant Stories, I recommed this Book to get behind the Glory and understand the Horrors and hardship of war."
3,Wrong Title,"""Ship of Ghosts"" should have been titled ""Building the Burma Railroad"" because that is what it is mostly about. The first 100 pages are about the ship and its crew and its sinking. I did learn a lot about the Dutch and their participation in the war. The last half of the book is about prisoners of war being taken and given the task of building the Burma railroad. It was a revisit to the '57 movie ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". Now, I liked the fictional movie but the real story was much different. I think the author set the record straight but he jumped around to different prisoners so much that it made the story at times hard to follow. The book was good but nothing like ""Unbreakable"". The book is a good WWII history book but not a book I would recommend to those not interested in the war."
3,Grossly overpriced,"Of the many books I've read on precious opal, all of which command comparatively high prices because of the limited market, this book is by far the most disappointing. True, the author has visited many of the opal sites world-wide, but so have I. While the anecdotal values are good, and there is a comprehensive explanation of opal formation theory, these are the same theories and stories found in many other similar books. I kept waiting for something new that never came. Then I was at the end of the book feeling cheated. This is a better than average book, and should be priced around $40."
4,Good for Requirements Gathering; read 2 times to understand.,"I'm a project manager and have given less than 5 stars because the book seems to have been written in a hurry. There are points which perhaps should be highlighted more, eg what steps should be included in Use Cases, or are we concerned only with messages passing between actors or is there more to it? I had to refer back to previous sections a number of times to fully appreciate the real message of Use Cases.This is a good book, also suitable for beginners. Personally I'd like to see more examples (summary level) for web projects, e-commerce and anything new.This book has made me understand Use Cases and their purpose, it has a number of useful suggestions on their application and implementation problems/politics. There should be more on how to use/link Use Cases with the 'complete' systems/business requirements documents.I will use this book as my reference when judging other people's understanding of Use Case concepts.ArdeMS, PhDUK"
2,If you only buy one book on pool...,"this shouldn't be it. Steve Mizerak is a great player, and watching him play is always a pleasure. Unfortunately, his grace at the table barely makes it into this book.I bought this book several years ago when I first started playing seriously, and it did little to improve my game. Once I started playing in the company of a few good players, I had no use for Mizerak's book. If you want that ""if you could only have one book on pool"" title, I highly recommend Robert Byrne's New Standard Book of Pool and Billiards."
2,Bad move.....,"Having been a fan of Westlife and their wonderful harmonies for a few years now, I was anxious to order this new cd. I was hesitant for two reasons, however. One, Brian McFadden (a strong member of the original group) has gone solo and two, they were attempting bratpack songs! The result is pleasant to the hear but void of any feeling or soul.....enough said......go back to the pop sound!"
1,Are you kidding me with this?,"This is karaoke at it's worst. One other reviewer said in here:""Mostly the credit must go to the enormously swinging back-up orchestra."" That's because it is note for note, instrument for instrument exactly the same back as the original. Listen to Westlife's ""Ain't that a kick in the head"", then go listen to Dean Martin's original. There's no difference! I would not be surprised at all if they sang to the same records, just with Dino, Sammy or Frank's voice edited out. These guys are horrible and should stick to screwing over the pop scene and leave the standards alone.Think I'm being mean? Check this review from the Stylus website:""Opener ""Ain't That A Kick In The Head"" is the most destructive thing to have happened to Dean Martin since emphysema.""I really can't improve on that.Folks, if you like this music, listen to the masters. Not the wannabees."
5,Gorgeous Wok!,"After researching different types of woks I opted to purchase this 16 inch hand hammered Carbon Steel Pow Wok. This wok has been created for The Wok Shop by artisans in China. I wanted to order from The Wok Shop since I had read from other reviewers that they have exceptional customer service. I found this to be a high quality wok, beautifully detailed and relatively inexpensive given the quality. This is one very heavy and large wok. I bought this as a Christmas present for my 20 something nephew and he seemed to be very pleased with it. I'm kinda jealous and may end up buying one for myself! I can't comment on the usability of this wok since I haven't spoken to my nephew, but once I do - I'll probably amend this review."
2,Not as advertised,I bought this thinking it was going to fit on the car antenna but it definetly isn't made for that. The wings are like paper/plastic...already ripped. Didn't even bother with returning this item!! I would avoid it if you were looking for something to put on your car antenna!
4,Harry Potter Party,"My grand daughter went to a Harry Potter party for children 9 to 12 years of age. We purchased the Gryffindor Costume (robe), broom and golden snitch for her outfit. The broom was a great accessory for her. It must have been a great hit, because it didn't make it home with her robe and broom."
1,piece of junk,"This product is an absolute piece of junk! My sister and I saved up our allowance for two weeks, and checked the mail every day, and when it finally arrived, the wing fell off as soon as we took it out of the package. Not to mention that when we dropped it when pretending we were Harry Potter on broomsticks, it cracked like an egg. We are sorry we ever paid the money to buy this product, and advise all other customers to not make the same mistake."
5,VERY COOL SNITCH!!,"I find the Snitch a very cool item and it is VERY sturdy so I don't understand why people have had a bad experience with it. I have the ""new"" type of antenna on my Toyota RAV4 and I had to cut off 2 of the ""flaps"" so that it would fit my antenna. It took quite some time to do this carefully and a VERY sharp razor as the plastic flaps are very thick, as is the construction of the ball. I hope it lasts forever and it is REALLY CUTE on my car :-)I now have bought 4 so that I have some in reserve, just in case I drive super fast on the freeway and the wings take flight!!!"
2,Good performance but poor recording,"Yes, I agree with other reviewers here - this is a well performed selection of music. If only I could say the same about the recording quality, which sounds more like two channel mono than full dimensional stereo. There is practically no central information in the stereo soundstage and the general quality is quite thin with a sound which favours the upper frequencies.Anyone who is used to listening to decent quality classical recordings or who has a halfway decent hi - fi system, is going to be rather disappointed. Why can't anyone produce decent big band recordings without resorting to a totally artificial sound balance?"
4,I love the sound !,"I must confess i don't reckon much to the 30s/40s casa loma sound.Or most 30/40s jazz for that matter.I'm curious as to who the 'hired guns' were to form this superior sounding band - sounds alot like billy may's boys (but who cares!)The Casa Loma is a castle in Toronto where they played alot at originally back in the 30s. One of the first white jazz bands.Glen Gray ""Spike"" Knoblauch was his actual nameSpike Knoblauch sounds pretty catchy actually !"
3,Heartfelt,This production makes you think of the many struggles associated with recovery and the role of religion in African American community.
4,stang,This. Is not the 96 but close the detail of body is great paint is not bad some diecast have poor paint on them but this is a good buy. I wish I could have it in white to replic of mine oh yea the motor is a poor .well I mean nothing facet
4,Very funny but too short,I'm a fan of David Sedaris and always enjoy his stories. This performance has a good mix of funny stories and had me laughing. Some of the material was duplicated from other CDs I had but was still funny. The CD is fairly short at less than 45 mins.
2,Funny for the amount you get,Wish Sedaris has made this 2 hours of material. Funny guy and wish I got more material than an hour for what I paid.
2,This tent is a wet lemon!,I used this tent once on a sunny trip and all was good. I recently used this tent for the second time and it rained. I was extremely disappointed at the amount of rain that leaked into the tent from almost every seam. Living in Washington we don't usually let the rain get us down but waking up soaked has a way of ruining a good weekend. If there is ANY chance of rain in your camping forecast I highly recommend NOT BUYING this tent. I wish it rained on my first trip so I knew what I was getting and returned it then. If you do get this tent keep the receipt as long as the product has a warranty because after 90 days Target will not stand by their product and return no matter how badly the product performs.
4,the best way to try alone,"the exam samples offered by the book are the best way to try yourself before going to the testing room. The book proved my ability to deal with all sections of the test and this improved my confidence in myself to crack stress beforehand. The book is the most powerful tool you can have beforehand, it's wonderful!"
5,"Have really enjoyed this tent, great investment!","My husband and I have recently purchased this tent and I have to say for the price and the quality, this has been a great buy!It is very easy to put together and is very roomy inside. It has been through a storm and it didn't leak one bit. We haven't had any problems with any of the zippers on the tent. The mesh skylight on the top of the tent is really nice when sleeping at night!Overall, we are VERY Happy with this tent and would recommend this to anyone!"
1,Weak Tent,"I have used this tent 5 or 6 times. Zippers always get stuck and the fly construction is terrible. If you plan to camp only durning spring or summer in perfect conditions, then for the price it is just okay. Shop around!"
2,Poor zipper design,"I really liked this tent, but when it came to actually using it, I grew to dislike it. It has the worst zipper design I have ever encountered. I have owned several tents and have never had this problem with another brand. This tent has large cloth over-hangs to cover the zipper and these are contstantly being caught in the zipper. Also the zippers do not meet perfectly when the tent is completely zipped, so there is always a small opening. I like the style of the tent, but not enough to continue using it, after only a year of use I am going to buy a different brand."
5,Incredible Read,"This is a wonderful, easy-to-read, easy-to-understand book. It is a self-help book and a motivational tool as well inspirational and thought-provoking. It the kind of book you would read more than once."
5,I did not want the book to be over!,I absolutely love this book. I could not put it down. When it was over I did not want it to be over. I wanted to keep reading! It inspired me immensely and his advice works. I have been telling everyone I know to buy this book. It will change your life. This book is a gem and this would be a perfect book for those who want help in creating positive intentions in their life and using the law of attraction. This book gives you the advice that is not in the Secret. Buy this book! You will love it!
4,Attracted to the Factor,"Though marketing written literature can be resourceful throughout this whole novel, you can still find key elements to compare and then benefit for the best of your own life. Some quotes I read in the novel went straight to tweets so i can remember them for further use. Great exercises along the way as well!!!!"
1,Spiritual Marketing with advertisements,"Disappointing. It seemed to me that this was a book that needed to quickly capitalize on the popularity of ""The Secret"" and Joe Vitale was caught unprepared. This book is nothing more than a newer version (not better) of his GREAT book, ""Spiritual Marketing,"" which came out way before ""The Secret.""The problem with ""The Attraction Factor"" is that it is NOT a better version of ""Spiritual Marketing."" On the contrary. This book has the same basic attraction concepts plus a whole bunch of filler stories and advertisements for other people's websites.I'm usually a fan of Joe Vitale's work, but I say you pass on this one and stick to the original, ""Spiritual Marketing,"" unless you really like advertisements. I gave this book a low rating because of its unoriginality."
3,A little New Agey but ...a Success Recipe,"Joe Vitale offers his tips and his own life story as affirmation of ways to fine tune your thinking. By so doing, he is convinced that this habit will draw you toward your goals and toward the things you want to attract to your life. Your mileage may vary."
5,Simplicity - The Perfect Tool for Your Daily Use,"I loved this book for its simplicity. I collect inspirational books and had purchased Joe's book last year when he launched it. My purchase is probably one of the thousands that helped him reach the top spot on the popularity charts. I finally read it a month ago and I like it because it clearly defines very simple steps that one can take to get ""clear"" on what is desired, then move forward to a successful result. Without clarity, one can't focus. I assist people to change their financial situations. Joe's book is a great tool for making a change in one's life. Once mastered, these steps are easily remembered and as I read in another post, can be used daily to create success as often as you want. Practice makes perfect. Uh rah!! Let's have more successful people talking about their successes. The more the merrier."
3,"attracting, say what?","There are a many great statements in the book ""The Attractor Factor"" - however - it lacks the promise of fullfillment."
1,I felt like i paid for an advertisement,"The sum of this book can be summed up in a short article but even that simple message gets bogged down by the author's constant plugging for his websites and other projects.It got so pervasive, especially in the second half of the book that any message the author was trying to convey was lost. Even the material he does focus on has been explained better by other writers.i would also like to note that my original review and another two by other readers that gave it two stars, were deleted. I have read the book -purchased on amazon -and the review focused on the book, as this one does as another reviewer wrote:This is the second review I wrote for this book. The last one mysteriously disappeared shortly after I posted it. There was nothing inappropriate in it--no foul language, no references to other reviews--but I did take strong umbrage at the author's persistent and transparent marketing of his cronies' goods and services."
2,"Basic Fundamentals, but not sufficient exam prep","The questions in the theoretical exams do not reflect what you will find on the actual test. If you use this book alone to prepare, there is a good chance you will fail the exam. In general, the questions will help you to grasp some fundamentals, but you will need to go over some more realistic test questions to prepare."
2,Couldn't cut the ham,"I purchased these knives right before Easter because they were attractive, but I was disappinted when they arrived. They are serrated only at the tip of the blade, and I had a hard time cutting through the Easter Ham with them. They have a nice weight, but as a steak knife are only slightly more effective than my butter knives. Purchase something else with real teeth if you're planning to need a steak utensil."
2,Small number of pieces allows for easy memorization....,My daughter (3 at the time) received this as a Christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game. The game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs (24 total pieces). I would avoid this game entirely.
4,Thanks from a beginner,"I bought a couple of books about Dreamweaver and I want to thank you for creating one that even a beginner could follow. The other books I bought were way over my head and I found myself lost before I even got started. I guess if I get more advanced I may appreciate some of the other books, but as someone who is new to Web design, I want to thank you for helping me get started. I couldn't have done it without you."
2,Very damaged book,"I realize that I ordered a used book, but this should not have been classified and ""used acceptable"" because the book looked like it had been run over by a truck. The pages were folded over, the spine completely falling apart, and I had to tape the spine and front and back covers on because they were hanging on by a thread. I have ordered many used books and they've always been in satisfactory condition. This one was really really used. For the price it's not that big a deal but there should maybe be more categories for used books."
2,Auto Ventshade 20554,I was excited to receive the carflector but after i installed the item wasnt what i expected the item doesnt cover the hole hood only 3/4 of the hood in other words the picture they show at the site is not what you get.
2,Mostly disappointing,"I'm familiar with at least half the artists and the albums and the stories this book tells about. Not much is accurate. The writer gives too many personal opinions on the music, many discographies lack important information, the selected sample lists are unnecessary (and take up LOTS of space in the book), and the reviews are uninsightful. Lots of research must've been done in order to get this much ""fact"" into these many pages, but obviously not enough. Not recommended."

1,lasts 30 minutes,"We got an almost identical Orka chew toy, for ""power chewers"". Our dog liked it, but in a few minutes it was in several pieces."
5,45 Year Anniversary,"First heard Gary Cardile (then backed by The Original Breed) in 1967. The Hulabaloo was the place to be on Friday night and it was always packed when Gary sang. Although he never made it big in the business, he never lost the soul. Put thisBetter Late Than Neveron your drivetime playlist."
1,Poor Quality,"This stove is a major disappointment in quality. This is only my 2nd coleman stove in 20 years. My first stove lasted that long, but coleman quality has not. I was worried about the stove's quality when I took the stove out of the box the first time and saw that even the stove's label was put on crooked.You cannot turn the burners down to simmer. High heat is constant and burned our bacon black and other foods unless watched every minute - flare ups from the burner to the bacon grease on the griddle I was using is a fire hazard. The high heat also scorched my new coleman griddle. If you just want to boil water fast - this stove is for you.The side wind blocker hinge broke on the second day of using the stove.I've already ordered a new stove from a different company and hope the burner controls work way better then the coleman."
2,Cruddy construction outweighs its functionality,"I've been a fan of Coleman stoves up until this one. As a previous reviewer posted, the shoddy construction and ultra-low quality sheet metal combine to create a product that I'm ready to get rid of. The edges are sharp, the top doesn't latch, and due to some engineering/manufacturing issue, the bottom green metal piece does not fit properly into the silver metal lip. I'm currently looking for a replacement stove because of how horribly this one is made.All that said, it does cook stuff pretty well without issue, but if it gets crushed on the car ride to the camp site, what's the point?"
5,It's a Coleman Propane Stove,"This stove is lightweight compared to the rest of the line, easy to clean, gets the job done and it's dependable. It's only problem is that the diameter of the burners is too small, you can't use 12"" pots, and it doesn't have enough BTU's to boil water fast. Listen, if space is not an issue, get the Coleman 2 Burner Powerpack Stove. It's a couple of dollars more than this stove. It's quite a bit larger than this stove, and it's as nice as cooking on a gas stovetop at home. You can boil tons of water quick, saute calamari or scallops while you're camping if you're so inclined, or make pancakes for a mob of people on your Lodge Reversable Grill/Griddle. There's some trips I use a single burner backpack stove, and then the rest of the time I'm eatin' homefries and cheese omelette's. You could cook chicken marsala with portobello mushrooms and sage on the Powerpack stove. The stove I'm reviewing is a great stove, just not for a family."
1,coleman stove,"I have owned three of these stoves over the years. i gave the first two to my kids and ordered this model. The windscreens are cheaply, made, fall off the stove which then doesnt support the rear screen. Once closed it required a hunting knife to open because the inner deck stuck to the lid. The right burner worked fine but the left burner flamed inefficiently.I feel this stove is a piece of junk and Coleman ought to feel ashamed of the sheet metal worksmanship on it."
5,"Look no more, you NEED this stove","The absolute perfect camping stove. You cannot go wrong with this one folks! Easy to use, clean, etc. Love, love, love it!"
3,"Good, but poor heat control","I bought this stove because it came highly recommended. When the stove arrived, I tested it out prior to going camping. It is very easy to set up. Good quality material. The biggest disappointment was the valve that controls the heat. It functions more like an On/Off switch. I exchanged the original one thinking I received a defect. The second one acted the same way. At that point, I didn't have time to get a new stove for my camping trip. I used the stove to cook just about every meal while camping. The problem with this stove is that the heat is always on high. When cooking I had to constantly stir the food to keep it from burning.Overall, I think the stove is very easy to assemble and made of high quality material. It feels very solid. But the heat adjustment control is very disappointing."
4,Spidey Fights Green Goblin Again,"But this is a bigger fight than in first issue. Nick Fury and Shield shows up to help Spidey. I really have a problem with Green Goblin being like the Hulk? Every villain is basically bulked up except for Spider-Man. There is a scene on the bridge with Goblin and Mary Jane and Spider-Man which looks eeringly similar to the death of Gwen, well somewhat similar. Another scene where Goblin battles Spidey at Osborne mansion looks like a scene from the movie but not entirely."
3,"Helpful, but woefully imcomplete","Though there were helpful parts, like the choices of readings and music, no where mentioned in the book are unity candles, for example or the ever-growing in popularity, wedding coordinator. The book was overly cute and wasted a lot of reader's time trying to be funny, which was entertaining, but not all that appreciated in a wedding guide. Potential problems that one could face in planning a Catholic wedding were skimmmed over too-lightly."
1,Old news,This is an attempt to make basic the from of worship in a tightly scripted method of worship ... far from the origianl concept that the early christians had.
1,Haha,One should never assume too much when referring to another ones expertise. Metal and slasher flicks have always been joined at the hip. But don't confuse your freddy kreugers with your lestats. Underworld is closer to gothic horror/fantasy then any of those gratitious slasher flicks that are void of everything including aesthetic.Of course the typical metal fan won't pick up on that due to the fact they're usually quite slow :D
4,GOOD SOLID SET-UP,This is an incredible album which sets the tone for other movies in the same genre.The only album I can think of that really sparkedmy interest in soundtracks is THE CROW soundtrack which was a CLASSIC.This album resembles a nice complexity of sounds it was well produced and mixed.Ths standouts are>AIDAN-The Last Sunrise and PUCIFER which are both well done songs.The whole album is good from start to finish although the last song shoulve been avoided you can enjoy this album knowing the dark eerie melodic tones are well worth the buy.Great album if you into the production and mixing.
3,@ Shawn,"The track which was used in the romantik scenes, like the sexscene, is ""Eternity And A Day"" by Paul Haslinger."
1,A Sad Waste of Talent,"I have every one of Linda Eder's albums and have seen her perform live (an experience I recommend highly). She is one of the best American singers ever. Her voice is, pardon the expression, ""gold."" But this album again exposes her biggest weakness, which if not corrected will do her in: SHE MUST STOP BEING EXPLOITED BY HER HUSBAND. Wildhorn is a mediocre composer with occasional moments excellence. And Eder is an excellent singer doing mundane, lowbrow material (mostly Wildhorn's) that wastes her talent. She must, like truly superstar singers (Streisand, for example) diversy her material and do only those songs that merit her brilliance."
2,Linda's Gold Doesn't Shine,"I am probably one of the biggest Eder fans out there and it pains me to say that Gold is not one of her best.The album does not do her justice. Linda does best with big orchestrations to match her larger than life vocal talents. On this record, the music pulls back and so does Linda. She seems confined by her songs rather than liberated."
5,"Pure ""Gold"" Indeed","When I hear the voice of Linda Eder I immediately recognize the unmatched talent of this very special lady. This CD for me is a perfect mixed of old and new. If you are a person who listens to the lyric of a song for the message it sends and its sensitivity, you've found a work with a very profound and strong selection of music. Those fans dedicated to Linda's show side might not appreciate the combination of songs in this work. If you however listen to each slection individually I think you'll agree this is a truly talented and versatile performer. Again, I haven't been this impressed by an artist in a very long time. ""Gold"" is indeed ""Pure Gold""."
3,I love Linda but . . . .,"this album was very disappointing for me. I adore her last two cd's ""It's Time"" and ""It's No Secret Anymore"" but this cd is NOTHING like those two. I knew that this album was being marketed as a ""pop"" album but never did I imagine the country sound that it would have. I'm not bashing country music (I actually own several country artist cd's) but Lindas voice is not suited to that kind of music. On her ""It's No Secret Anymore"" cd, she sings ""This Time Around"" and she is magic! When she does the big band/broadway belters/ballads, she is in control and noone can compare. On her newest cd, ""Gold"", the only songs that she ""sells"" are ""If I Lose My Way"", ""Gold"" and ""If I Had My Way"". There are a few others that I like and will listen to but in some of them, the key is so low that at times you can't even hear her. I am highly disappointed in this album and I hope that in the future she continues to do the music that shows her off."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"I have to agree with what many others have written; this album was a bit of a disappointment. While not BAD by any stretch, it's a tad bit more vanilla than I was hoping for. I'm all for Linda stretching her wings a bit and riding the Pop Music riff. I guess I just wished that she would strike more of a balance here. There's nothing on this album that SOARS, like her previous recordings. Nothing that makes you want to break out into song. Even GOLD, the title track that everyone is raving about, strikes me as less than impressive. This is definitely one album that I'll only listen to a few times before hopping back on the waiting train for the next one."
3,"Linda goes ""POP""","Linda Eder fans be warned. There are only 3 tracks on GOLD thatare ""Broadway"" Linda Eder. The remaining 11 tracks are strictlycontemporary sounding. The voice continues to shimmer and shine, but most of the material is beneath Linda's talent. I realize she's trying to extend her audience, but a few more show tunes would have been a better mix.With such a wealth of Broadway music available, why does Linda continue to record so many of her husband's mediocre melodies?????????????"
4,Three worlds in one person,"Tom Wright starts by pointing out that Paul lived in 3 cultures, Jewish, Greek and Roman. By putting him so firmly in his background, Wright opens up new levels of understanding of Paul. This book is not an ""easy"" read but it is worth reading and re-reading. The reader begins to glimpse the glasses of the modern world through which we have looked at Paul and superimposed alien thinking on him. As always Tom Wright's book brings together many threads and leaves one with a lot to think about."
5,Excellent read,"NT Wright continues to be a shining light in New Testament scholarship. This treatment of the theology of the apostle Paul is academically sound while retaining Wright's refreshing apprehension towards the modern hermeneutic of paranoia that has pervaded scholarship for the last two centuries. Wright's attentiveness to the deep Jewishness of Paul and his writings opens the door for more interesting discussions about the meaning of the Christian faith and life for believers today. A must read for the serious...and one can only hope that the serious includes ""mainstream"" scholars as well."
2,A New Introspective,"I fear that N. T. Wright in his attempt to produce a novelty has been caught disregarding much of the evidence in the NT supporting the ""old"" teaching of justification by faith. He dislikes the doctrine of transferring the righteousness of Christ to believers by divine fiat. Justification to Mr. Wright is merely God's untimely decision to include Gentiles in His saving of mankind. It's as if God had a change of heart and regretted His former bias in favor of Jews. The imputation (a word Wright despises) of righteousness to the believer is explicitly stated in Rom 4:11, 22; 5:17, 18 and Phil 3:9."
2,Disappointment,I hated this book. I usually love books and finish every one in less than 3 day but this book was just horrible. It took me over 2 months to read it. I kept hoping it would get better but it didnt. Nothing ever happens. In the whole book people have pointless conversations and thoughts. The ending was stupid... very horrible and not realistic at all. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone. Save your money for something better.
3,saturday night live the best of eddie murphy(bonus edition),only like the james brown part and the steve wonder.i think the rest was not funny at all.
3,Falls Short!,"This DVD fell short of the quality of the original VHS version. There were so many great clips left out. I can sum it up in one sentence: More Eddie, less Buckwheat."
5,Great classic SNL,"First of all I am a die hard fan of SNL and Master Murphy. (Eddie Murphy) This DVD is filled with all his hilarious skits and a couple from when he hosted in 1984. My favorite was Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood. ""Well, we're all alone again today. Know why? My wife walked on me. I'm so glad the bitch is gone!"" LOL!!! The Buckwheat skits are also die laughing funny, and so is Gumby! ""I'm Gumby, dammit!"" LOLOLOLOL!!! Eddie Murphy is hilarious, SNL is hilarious, and this DVD is hilarious! I also recommend--The Best of Will FerrellThe Best of Gilda RadnerThe Best of Adam SandlerThe Best of Phil Hartman andThe Best of Tom Hanks (He hosts alot)"
2,It is not worth the price or the discomfort,"My dog is an escape artist so I had been using a choker chain. Of course I wanted something better, so I purchased the ""gentle"" leader from the vet and had it fitted there. It does what it says it will in that the dog will not pull, but now my dog HATES his walks. He starts out and then just wants to go home. It is not comfortable for the dog. The neck strap that goes high on the head just under his ears has to be so tight that only one finger can fit underneath. Of course it isn't comfortable with a strap that tight anywhere. It just isn't worth it. I have since learned about the prong collar and will try that one. At least if you by it on Amazon you won't have to pay what the vet charged me for it!"
2,Disappointed!,I have read every single one of Ms. Howard's books. This one was not up to speed. By the middle of the book I didn't care what happened to either of the characters.
3,Kind of wierd!,"Okay first of all, I couldn't get into Karen Whitlaw's character. She really bored me silly. I thought Marc was super sexy and really liked him. There was one exception about him though. The whole ""I am already wearing a condom because I just 'know' we'll fall into bed soon."" that was really kind of gross and I would have had a big problem with that.Other than the romance part of this story, the other plotline was too insane for me."
1,Confuses Sex with Love; Shallow Main Male Character,"I like how Howard writes, but I really didn't like how Marc seemed really shallow and like he was just trying to ""get some"" and take advantage of Karen. The suspense was interesting, but the romance disappointing.Mr. PerfectandOpen Seasonwere better; they didn't hop into bed so quickly in those, and the characters were more developed and likeable."
4,great investment for my camera,"The wide-angle covers about the same area as the camera lens by itself and I probably won't use it much, but the telephoto is totally worth it!"
5,A must for every therapeutic eye care practice.,"Organized, thorough and useful. Includes refractive surgery management"
5,A book to have,"I ordered this book online after recommendations from some of my professional colleagues. First, i was amazed by the caliber of its contributors-all consultants (MDs). Its a very rich ophthalmologic book, with numerous clinical ocular conditions and treatments well presented. Its a real EYE MANUAL if you ask me. At the moment, i think, it should be a mini bible for every eyecare professional- Optometrists/Ophthalmologists). The book is a must-have. I recommend it."
3,Over-rated,"A book of considerable potential, which it fails to achieve. Worth investigating, but check it out from the library and read it before you buy it.His basic thesis is that all employees in commercial organizations need to be led from above, but that power corrupts so we should all be skeptical of being led from above. He does have some interesting and useful observations on managment/organizational behavior experts through the nation's (U.S.) history. Unfortunately his personal opinion as opposed to a critical evaluation of their merit keeps getting in the way. Pity, because a well considered opinion of the ideas, impacts and evolution over the years would have been an interesting read."
5,A Wonderfully Cheesy Way to Learn About Growing Up,We had to watch this great film at school in fifth grade and it has greatly influenced my life. It is very annoying adn cheesy but I truly believe that it was a good an fulfilling experience to watch it.
5,Great Book!,"A really interesting read for me considering I am a competitive shooter, could tie into other sports also but seems to be mainly focused for the rifle shooter,Great idea's, highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to improve their mental game."
5,LiftTrix - wonderful product - please bring it back.,"I have loved this product for such a long time - but it's been discontinued. Please, please bring it back. When you use LiftTrix your hair does NOT feel dirty or heavy. It is shiny & works so well w/my hair. Please bring it back. Amazon was good to work with as well."
1,"Flimsy, worthless",Returned to Amazon immediately.Inferior product provides no support whatsoever.Flimsy material and mesh cannot withstand any weight.
1,overpriced,"The product itself was ok. The elastic stretched out quickly but overall the product was good.The down side is I found the same product at the dollar store after purchasing two for $15.00 each and add shipping,well you do the math."
3,comfortable but it slips,"This lumbar support is comfortable, if a little soft (my physical therapist recommended a much firmer pillow-- this is a bit softer than an aeron chair). However, the elastic strap to affix it to the chair is really stretchy and is not adjustable, so it keeps creeping lower and lower into the chair's space between the back & the seat. This reduces the effectiveness dramatically and i'm always having to slide it back up the back of the chair. Annoying!"
5,Love it.,"Bought one of those new fancy chairs you see on every tv program out there. Looks cool but awful back support. My back was aching so I looked for some back support and found this little gem. It's very like weight and great design. Great price too. Although my chair is not as cool with this on it, this extra back support has been a life saver. It has me arching my back and added support while I work on my computer for long periods of time."
3,Good if I add a pillow...,My main problem is neck pain. I work at least 6 hrs per day 5 days per week sitting at the computer desk doing data entry. It does help support my lower back...but i really need something for my upper back and neck. I have to add a pillow towards the upper part of my back in order to get the support that i need. You get what you pay for I guess...
4,"Comfortable and lightweight, moderate amount of lumbar support","I'm very happy with this product that I purchased for my desk chair. Although it's lightweight, the frame makes it a little large for portable/travel use. I find it very comfortable, but the flexible mesh may not give as much support as other lumbar support cushions, so if you need more firm support you may wish to consider other products. I'm planning to get one for the office too."
3,Broke with in a week,"I bought this item as I have awful lower back issues. I am in law enforcement and I am in a cruiser for 8 hours a day, wearing a waste full of gear. The support felt amazing but the elastic that held it on the seat broke with in the first week of being around the seat of my crown victoria. not happy..."
5,Happy Customer,This product is great for back or any lumbar problems. We drive alot and it helps relieve tireness and stiffness. I would recommend it.
1,Invest your Money on a Better Product,"True, you can buy this product at the dollar tree. That is the quality you will get. The support is minimal. I nor other employees at the office did not feel the expected relief or any relief for tha matter. More than 3 of us tried it. I purchased another similar product but on the $25 to $35 range and is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. Save up and buy a better product."
3,"""lumbar"" suppot","I was surprised how stiff this support is... usually they're a little more flexible. Also, it has a hard time staying up on the top of the chair. Maybe the elastic is weak. But once we safety-pinned it into place is does give pretty good support."
1,SAVE YOU MONEY,This lumbar support gives very little support and does not stay in place. Granted this item doesn't cost much but you should save your money anyways.
3,Not for all chairs,"I suppose this was not relevant to my case as my chair is WAY different than the one that is pictured on the image, having said that, I even had tried it on other chair which looked more or less like the one pictured, but still did not help much, I had to return it."
3,This is an okay product overall (driving and at the office),"My experience with this product is that it is good for long driving trips. You do not feel backpain.But, at the office I have not noticed any difference in my back pain after using this product.So, it is an okay product (overall)."
1,Does nothing!,"I bought this item because of the great reviews. However, when it arrived I was very disappointed. It is very flimsy and doesn't add extra support at all. I was hoping it would make the chair in my office more comfortable for my long work days. I guess you get what you pay for! If you are looking for back support, go with a different product."
3,Not enough by itself,This product is not strong enough to hold its shape when I lean back against it. I have had to add a pillow to fix this problem. Also it tends to slip down so that I am constantly adjusting it. I would suggest exploring other options before buying this product.
1,Doesn't fit all office chairs...,"I have a standard office chair at work, similar to the one in the picture. However, this lumbar support doesn't stay up like in the picture, it falls to the seat part of the chair. It's not adjustable and moves around so it pretty much doesn't work."
2,PosturePro,"The product has great support. However, product cannot be secured to the chair. It continually slips down. In my case there is a space between the chair seat and the back rest. Because I cannot secure it in place it will slip through this space and provide no support at all."
4,Excellent product at a great price,"Recieved a month ago. Found it very comfortable and unobtrusive. Since I received it very recently, I can not comment about its durability."
2,Actual Product Changes Daily!!! =(,"The bad thing about this item (as well as other competing ones on Amazon) is that the actual product represented seems to change almost daily. I first ordered this item and received a very high-quality product with wonderful stiffness and support. I ordered the same item a few days later and received a completely different product with very flimsy support. Now I'm looking at it a third time, and seeing that it ships from yet another retailer. I've had this happen for all the lumbar supports I've ordered on Amazon (i.e. Angel Sales PosturePro Lumbar Support, Travelon Cool Mesh Back Support System, Kiss My Back). There's just no continuity -- you just have to cross your fingers and see what you get."
4,Lumbar Support,This product is great for your back. I have this in my truck and have noticed a huge increase in comfort of driving without a sore back afterword. I would recommend this product if you feel like you are slouching and tend to have a sore back after driving.
5,Very good product for ppl with lower back pain,"I read good reviews abt this and ordered 2 of them(didnt hurt for $10 each). When i opened the package, it looked kinda flimsy, made of mesh like material. I put one in the car seat and immediately i cud tell the difference, it gave v good support to lower back. No more back pain after long drives. I put one in the office chair and have lesser lower back pain these days.I wud recommend this product."
3,Not as supportive as I had hoped.,I bought this hoping for super lumbar support for my office chair. It has too much give in the mesh material and constantly slips down the back of my chair. Some fault can be placed on my chair; the seat is much to long and I find that I typically only sit on the front half of the chair with no back support. The PosturePro did not bring the back of the chair any closer to my back and I still have the same issues as before.
3,works ok,"These worked fine, but over time the straps tended to stretch out. Had to cut them and then tie them together."
2,Very disappointed in this one,"I'm only 5'2"" and found that my back hurt worse when I used it. I had to throw it away. Maybe it would work better for someone who is much taller than I am."
5,Just Great !!!!!,"It's top 3 on my list of CDs. You won't belive how good it is !!!You can buy it with your eyes closed, up side down, and I can say, honestly, you won't regret."
5,Nice photos,"The photography in this book is beautiful, and the text is well written. Rather than buing this before your next trip to Barbados, I'd recommend a simple travel guide instead. You may want to buy this book later for your coffee table for when you are feeling nostalgic for the warm air and white beaches."
1,worthless,"produce isn't used in the us any longer,would not pickup on any of my systems,wireless systems with enough strength to operate"
4,A head chopping good time,"We've played this game a few times and really have enjoyed it. It seems to work best with groups of four or five, but no bigger (as the box recommends). It's not that tough to explain the rules and a fast game playing time. Great game!"
4,"Fun, easy to learn",I was a little nervous when the box said for ages 12 and up but this game proved easy enough for my 7 and 10 year old to catch on. (Some of the subject matter is a little gory) but my kids were up for it. It is a fairly quick game and we snuck in a little history as well!
4,Review of Guillotine at Stuffed Ashes,"Guillotine is a 2-5 player card game designed by Paul Peterson and published by numerous gaming companies, including Hasbro. For those of you who do not know, a guillotine was a device used to execute people by decapitation.At first I looked at this game and was shocked that it's premise is about chopping off various noble's heads for points. Gory, right? And how about inappropriate? Maybe a little. But it was already purchased and brought home, so I gave it a chance as I do with all games. The game's premise is comedic, and not actually meant to offend anyone. It is for ages 12 and up due to its theme, although I think a mature enough 9-year old could play...For the rest of this review, please visit Stuffed Ashes"
3,Functional but not the best quality,"These will do the job but the feel isn't right. They are to light and not balanced the best. Also, they don't hold an edge well so you have to resharpen more often than with better quality products."
2,This is probably not what you expect,"I thought Sabatier was a French Company with excellent product. However, this set is made in China for Excel and not the quality that I expected. In this case, you get what you pay for"
1,No Warranty,"Ride Rite by Firestone will not warranty these airbags! Mine corroded and failed after three years yet they refused to warranty them because i bought them on-line even though i paid full retail through an authorized retailer. Recommend the ""Air Lift"" brand over Ride Rite by Firestone; same design with a company that stands behind warranty. Purchase here: http://www.amazon.com/57215-LoadLifter-Series-Air-Spring/dp/B00017YYIG"
3,I found a better (rubber) cap for lessss....,"While these caps serve their purpose to protect USB ""A"" ports, I am not happy with the hard plastic material and overall design. I find these not easily removed because the shape is beveled and slippery even though ribbed...really just too small to grip. Also, the cost is okay but, with shipping, it's outrageous. I found a nice rubber-made cap made by Digi-key...about half the cost and half the shipping charge."
4,Good quality,"I bought this product for school. I liked this product, it was shipped quickly and was exactly how it was described in the description."
5,The 4-inch paring knife is my favorite!,"I never thought that the extra inch on anything like a paring knife would make a difference to me -- that is until I got this baby.I love this little knife! Who knows, maybe I find the very short length of most paring knives to be frustrating for many small paring-knife type tasks. I'd say I consistently. reach for the 4-inch paring knife first, and use my shorter ones when it's dirty (or already in someone else's hands!)A word about the Provence handles -- they are gorgeous, and the way they're manufactured -- infused with resin, you get all the benefits of a plastic handle with the rosy beauty of the wood. Unlike plain wooden handled knives, these babies won't get gross looking or ever make you wonder if something's growing in there. Love love love this lovely little knife!"
4,SOFTNESS,"I love everything from Eckard, but his voice is extremely soft and sometimes almost not understandable. Probably the recording wasn't done correctly, but I still like it a lot."
3,Frustrating reading. Not recommeded for Kindle readers.,I am in the middle of reading this book. Although I find myself intregued by the story I have to say that this book is not at all Kindle friendly. I find it impossible to navigate the foot notes. Very frustrating.
5,Excellent Read,"This book is an excellent read for anyone who interested in this mocern-day Salem witch trial. Leveritt truly captures the unreal atrocities of the crime, the reprehensible behavior of West Memphis officials, and the lesser-known innocents in this case: the convicted. As someone who lives within 75 miles, I was familiar with the case and its results and will be the first to tell you that this case still sparks a fire in many. A definite must-read for anyone who wishes to hear true story of the case, the misrepresentation and abuse by community officials desperate to tag anyone with a conviction, and/or the deeply-held religious fear and fanaticism so prominent in the area at the time. Truly disturbing."
4,Excellent legal journalism - should spur readers into action,"I an attorney and if anything have a ""pro-prosecution"" bias, but this well-written, hard hitting book won me over to the defense.This conviction is ridiculous - it is simply not possible for these kids to have done this, to have committed the acts of surgical / sexual mutalation that were committed on the Byers boy with such precision - at night, in the dark, in 15 minutes, and in the water. Even without considering the ""Salem Witch Trial"" / persecution aspects, a review of the physical evidence and an application of common sense demands that these people need to be released.I don't know that Byers' Sr committed the crime, but he was a jewler, had access to the tools and the dexterity to do it. And, as sick as it is, most murders are committed by family members - Byers was a victim's stepfather."
2,This man should not write on the topic of music,"Sean Gibbon knows very little about Phish. What he does know is mostly myth. This should be all you need to know about this book: At one point, he eats a brownie laced with either LCD or marijuana and goes to the hospital. He acts as if he were going to die at any moment. Does not capture the joy of phish phans or Phish's music."
1,In agreement with AdamCook's review,"There is not much to add after reading the above review by Adam Cook,it throughly explains exactly how disgraceful this book is.This was the documentary of a rich boy's parentally funded Phish Tour.The perspective from which it was written is poor, and the book itself was full of unjust generalizations.The only thing that drove me to finish it was that it was so angering."
3,Not for the diehard Phish phan,"Through my perspective, someone who listens to Phish on occasion, I found the book to be informative in many ways. However, I have many friends that do the whole touring thing who would probably laugh at the book. I feel it's hard to understand someone elses perspective when you're so certain that your mode of thinking is right. My Phish friends sometimes only see it their way and are unable to understand that some people don't like Phish. I do think Gibbon complained some, however it does help paint the picture of what was going on.;"
2,Be warned. Gay Dracula is edited,I have purchased the VHS and DVD version of SNL Halloween. Both have the funniest part edited out of Travolta's Dracula skit. I have not been able to find an unedited version on the internet either.
4,Some of the selections are not quite bright,"I think I could do without ""The Spartans"" and the ""Adam Sandler Costume Ideas"" sketches. They're just annoying. But the Gay Dracula, Matt Foley and the Vampire Dating sketches make the DVD worth buying"
3,"Really, really basic","I did learn some useful technique tidbits from this book, and it has some amusing anecdotes, but this book is really for someone who is a true beginner. So I can only really recommend for those who have NO idea what is in a typical gym weightroom."
3,Geared toward women. Men look elsewhere.,"The book was fairly decent, but it is primiraly geared toward women. If you are a man looking for a weight training primer, look elsewhere."
5,Excellent!,"This is one of the better weight training books on the market. It cuts through the multitude of muscle building ""garbage"" and gives the real scoop. The section on supplements is excellent since most of them are a waste of money anyway. A healthy well balanced diet combined with adequate rest and the exercise routines in this book will give great results. Books like this bring some sanity to the weight lifting world."
5,"Excellent, excellent book","This is a great book to get started weight training. It has lots of excercises, and tips on how to do them. It leads you through desiging a workout routine. My favorite part is a section at the end with suggested workouts for people who are really into different sports: in-line skating, etc."
1,Horrrible Book,"If you're a dummy, you might like this book. If you are interested in weighttraining, buy another one. The conservative approach to supplements is the stupidest part of this book. Thumbs down!"
4,Great for beginners,"Very good introduction to weight training. If you already work out with weights regularly, the amount of new information in it might not justify the price. Of particular help is the section on putting together excercise routines, showing several ays of designing a total body workout using different excercises for the same muscle groups."
5,A well rounded weight training book.,"I have alot of home gym equipment and really don't care about joining a gym. This book was exactly what I needed to get a weight lifting routine for my personal needs, plus it's alot of fun to read."
4,Cute little fellas,"These are adorable. It's fun to see them sitting around, even without anything in them. They can be jazzed up with cupcake/muffin tops or filled with candy or whatever you can think of. I was only disappointed with the packaging - thus the minus-one star, because if I'd been giving this as a gift or if it had been breakable/crushable (thankfully silicone is not) it would have been unusable. The packaging was completely smashed when I got it."
4,valeu apena,very talentent musictians playing some great hip hop/ reaggea with samba and manny good rhythoms
1,Not suitable for in-line: only use for submersible,"I rate this pump zero stars for in-line use. It leaks like a sieve. I bought it to use for a fountain that has the plumbing outside of the fountain, and I could not add enough teflon tape and hose washers to keep it from constantly leaking from multiple spots. I couldn't tighten the parts enough to stop it. Do not consider this pump for out of water usage. It seems like it might work fine for underwater usage - a little leaking would not hurt. Also, there are a lot of adapters handy, but they do not allow you to connect to PVC. It is definitely built for hoses. Be careful - this says in-line but it better be installed underwater or it will make its own pond. I bought it to replace a Danner Pondmaster that had developed a leak. That was no improvement. I am going back to the Danner, and taking my chances that it will last leak-free for a while."
1,Why upgrade if you're a BillPay user?,"Money 2004 Premium came with TWO (2) free years of BillPay. From the reviews I have read, Money 2005 Premium only comes with three months of free BillPay and then I have to pay for the service. Why would BillPay users upgrade?"
1,Very Disappointing,"Stick with Money 2004 if you have it or go to Quicken. This product does not work with Citibank, requires you to put all your info on MSN server, and has a poor interface and really bad help. Save your money and use something else."
3,"Pretty thorough, lacking examples","I have to say that this book is very thorough and that I have learned a lot from it. Still, I found the book a little boring and cryptic because of its lack of examples and stories.There are so many ideas which are thoroughly explained conceptually, but are hard to visualize - although, in fairness, there are a ton of good stories and case-in-points. [See, for example, how your local paper would explain why Pepsi decided to close a bottling plant, or how Microsoft went about improving Windows 7 - now that's something you can relate to.]Maybe, just maybe, this book is a good refresher for people who did go to business school. I, a high school graduate and avid reader, failed to digest about 35% of the material."
3,Not bad,"This book was not bad, but it needs more sample plans. If you are writing a Business Plan, this book will get you started, but it will not get you finished."
4,Great rain protection,"We have had a lot of tents and taken many tents back to the stores because they were a) to hard to put together and/or b) they had awful rain protection (ie: leaking mainly).This tent was not hard to put together. It has its own bags with closures, easy instructions and it DOESN'T LEAK!! The flaps are positioned so that the rain doesn't come through the zippers or at the bottom of the doors. The more expensive tents leaked bigtime."
1,Do you like to read your art?,I had heard such positive reviews about this book only to be greatly disappointed. More than half the time you are unsure if you are reading in the present time or the past which is confusing at best. Sometimes you think you know only to find out you were wrong so you would need to go back to re-read the section. This was distracting to the overall feel of the book. No plot to speak of -- just depressing drivel. The section of the book about the art show near the end of the novel I believe sums this book up when they play the film. Not good.
2,Sketchy (2.5*s),"The book is described by some as noir, enigmatic, and zigzagged, and not inaccurately. It essentially follows a career thief Mark Chamberlain as he plies his craft. Lurking in the background is the disappearance of a high school girl Caroline May some twenty years prior. Mark and Caroline were developing a relationship just before she disappeared and she still seems to be constantly on his mind, filtering his worldly actions and interactions.There is not much of plot. The characters are minimally drawn and the dialog is very cryptic, especially Mark's. The shifting of time frames adds confusion more than anything. Some of the writing is edgy and sharp. The question is whether a series of vignettes, some of which are insightful, constitute a novel. In the end, the book seems too sketchy - lacking in clarity and completeness."
5,Another Solid Release,"I don't understand why people are not enjoying this album as much as I am. This is a good move for the band as they side step metalcore and stick to a more in-your-face hardcore sound. Sure the clean vocals are more dominant as opposed to their past releases, but it actually adds another dimension to each song. While this is nothing new to the genre, the melodic vocals are catchy and never grate the listeners ears or go on for too long. The keyboards are used to help layer their sound and make each track even more memorable. To sum it up, the band still retain the heaviness of their previous efforts while also adding more melody to the mix. This is a solid release that is worth picking up, because the more you listen to it the more you love it. If you enjoy this band definately check out Still Remains, Evergreen Terrace, Odd Project, Across Five Aprils, On Broken Wings, August Burns Red, and many many more...."
2,Their truth is lost on me!,"Bleeding Through have upped the keyboards and the clean vox, to produce a lesser album than all their previous efforts. At times its reminiscent of Finntroll's ""Nattfold"" but neither makes me wan t to dance or kick ass, instead I am left feeling a sense of emptiness and plain boredom"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"Bleeding through just straight up sucks, they sound like every other metalcore bands that swears they sound different, thesinger is horrible. i mean all he does is complain and whin through out the whole cd. just suck it up. doesnt he have enough balls to come up with something better and quit bytching? anywayz i dont recommend this so called ""metal"" cd, more like emo. but i do recommend some children of bodom, trivium, or kreator. now thats talent."
3,creative,its a very creative two sided blade.i have never seen nothing like it before.i would advise not to over use it though.
3,"Good info about safe sunbathing and its benefits, but a dry read","I bought this because I wanted to learn how to derive benefit from sunbathing. ""How to"" information comprises maybe 1/5 of the book. Another component is a laundry list review of major diseases and how sunlight can prevent them, and the rest is a history of use of sunlight in medicine and architecture dating back to the Egyptians, Greeks , and Romans. I'm glad I read the book, but it is a very dry read."
4,Marmalade Disaster,"Since Kei came along he's been nothing but trouble! He's got Miki all sad because he won't give back the bracelet. That jerk! I think I'f he really loved her than he would let her be happy with Yuu. As for Suzu, she needs to get a life and mind her own business. Don't get me wrong, I love Marmalade Boy. (It sounds like I hate it!) I think there could have been more supense and humor, but we'll see next volume!"
5,Great bridal shower gift,"The aprons are great quality, thick enough to feel durable but not overly stiff to be uncomfortable. I purchased this as part of a bridal shower gift for a bride (and groom) that love to cook, and it was a hit!"
5,Can't wait...,Can't wait to give these to the engaged couple. The fabric is really nice and the ability to adjust for size is great. I know they'll love them. Received them within a few days. Love Amazon.
4,Good ending for a good series,"This is the last book of Colleen McCullough's Rome series and in it she recaptures some of the zest and eyes open worldliness that made the first two books so wonderful. Cato is rehabilitated a bit in this book, as is Brutus. Caesar loses some of his lustre. The bits with Octavian were especially good, showing him to be very cool and calculating even as a young man."
5,Great Fountain But Not At This Price!,"We have owned this fountain for over 8 years. It was a great purchase at $150 less then the current price. It is sturdy and durable (it's been through Hurricanes Charlie, Jean, Wilma, and the May Floods of 2008) and still works great. You can find this fountain and save yourself a great deal of money by shopping your local home improvement stores. You should clean the pump monthly. To prevent mosquitoes, monthly use an algae solution which your home improvement stores sell for about $10. Our bottle has lasted through an entire year. The sound of the water falling is so relaxing after a long day at work. It is just outside our patio, and I enjoy listening to it as I read. Excellent purchase but you can find better deals elsewhere."
2,Nothing New here,This is a reference book with no original ideas.You can easily tell that she must have read a bunch of NDE (Near Death Experience) books and just re-worded everything she read.No incite and based on general and Common seance ideas.If you have read any NDE books you don't need to look here because there is nothing new to be found.Unless you have no common seance of what is morally or ethically correct save your money!!!
5,Great toothbrush....though it pays to shop around!,"This is the best Sonicare yet... and this is a really nice package. It DOES pay to shop around .... a certain warehouse club whose name starts with a ""C"" and ends with an ""O"" is selling this for significantly less. I hope Amazon matches their price.Again, a great toothbrush, I wouldn't want to be without it."
2,its good but not worth $20 that i paid for,"my newphew loved the school bus its extremely good if you dont have much room space. it fits under the sofa or you can fold it even smaller to about the size of pr. of jeans when folded.the only problem i had with is that i bought it two months and already the seams are torn. my newphew play a bit rough, such as pulling, and kicking the bus like 2 yrs would."
4,Get on the bus!,I bought this toy for my nephew (5yr) a couple of years ago and he loved it!! He plays with it in so many different ways that it amazes us. He is sometimes the driver and his other cousins are school kids on the bus and other times this is just a crawl through house...He has pretended to change tires on this and since it is so easy to pack and take along he has even carried it to the beach..I think he loves it and that make sme happy!
4,school bus as a gift,Bought for 2 year old twins... it held up with about 5 kids in it and even an adult at the birthday party. The only thing that doesn't appear to be the greatest is the detachable steering wheel because with my kids it would end up missing in no time. Definitely a great gift.
5,Fun for everyone,This is one of the best inventions ever. A HUGE toy that my son loves and when he's done with it will EASILY fold up to fit under his bed. The whole family can get into it together - and we do. It has an inflatable steering wheel that clips onto the tent and sunroof windows where you can stick your head out. What more do you want for this price?
2,They Break Super Easy,"They appear nice but, looks can be deceiving!They are crap. They break most often after 1-2 drives.Don't waste your money!"
4,Golf Tees/Stocking Stuffer,Gave these as a stocking stuffer for a new golfer in the family. He was very happy to receive them.
2,Not enough information,"You would be better off buying a book about a specific Macromedia application rather than trying to save money with this ""all-in-one"". There is simply not enough information in order to explain the concepts well enough. This book explains something once and then goes on to the next topic. I would compare it more to the Help section than a tutorial.Instead, I would recommend the SAMS Teach yourself Flash in 24 hours - it is more comprehensive and easier to follow. If you think you are getting a steal with all 7 books for the price of one, don't buy this book."
4,Nice work,"well, the actual song ""shine on "" as well as black pawn and Friendly Fire are very good songs, nice club beat to the cd, however the remixes are a bit slow and kinda drag this single down.shine on- 4/5 a good rock sound plus the combined efforts of apop to have a ebm sound. very good work.black pawn- 5/5 very good song. the lyrics bring you back to the older days of apop, where emotion is the true nature.friendly fire- 5/5 good song.You Keep Me From Breaking Apart -...according to phillip remix- 2/5 - kinda slow and brings down the regular song, plus, i never really liked remixesTuning In To The Frequency Of Your Soul - drugwar remix-2/5same as above, brings the origenal down.18/25"
1,Junk. Painful to use. No hard wire option,"If you mistype the code you have to wait 30 seconds before you can type it again! REALLY! So if your guest misses a button or the keypad doesn't register the press (as both ours often do) they are left confused as to why the gate code doesn't work.This is a junk product. Not work the money. I threw both ours in the trash and installed a garage door opener board and used garage door keypads instead.You will have nothing but trouble with the this remote. It will frustrate guests and family alike. Avoid at all costs,Mighty Mule no longer provided terminals inside the keypad to run power from the control panel, you can ONLY use batteries. Sure most people will use batteries for convenience, but a good portion have already run wire out to where the keypad will go to ensure the keypad will still work when the battery fails. We all use remotes here, so the keypad gets very little use. Invariably the one time it is needed the battery will be flat."
2,Compatability Problems,"This EXTRA key pad may work with Gate Openers, but it is not compatable with the Pedestrian Gate Lock. After contacting technical support three time the first was to check with compatability. The FM137 does not have a relay built in. The kwey pad that will work with the pedestrian gate lock is Model F310. This model has a relay built in. This model is not sold on amazon."
5,Entryway keypad,"Love it, works great. Now my gate is secure. I would recommend this keypad to anyone needing to add security to their entryway gates."
3,good but not good enough,"This is a great kit if you already like origami because it comes with lots of different sized papers. It gives no information about kirigami except for scissors. We are using it for replacement papers, as it turns out. This makes it very expensive because paper is about .... Not a good value."
3,For carnivores,"Not a bad value. An inordinate amount of meat seems to cling to them even after a good rinse. They come out of the dishwasher clean, but I don't like picking at the meat when dessert is on the way. I would buy them again, tho."
2,Starter book on performance reviews.,"This book would not be terribly helpful to someone who's had some experience in writing performance reviews. It's very basic, but may be a good starting point for a new manager or supervisor."
3,Good overall book on performance reviews.,"In addition to short phrases that can be used on performance reviews the book has general overviews of how to structure and present performance reviews, along with common mistakes made by managers and employees."
3,#98T80,I bought this watch for my wife for our anniversary. It's a beautiful watch but we had to return it because it was too big for her wrist and there was no adjustment for the bracelet. We even took it to our jeweler but to no avail.
3,returned item,Nice watch but Mother of Pearl face lacked luster (appeared white) so I decided to return it. The seller was pretty good about accepting the return though.
5,Delivered as Promised,"The Bulova watch was delivered earlier than promised, well-packaged and protected. I could not have asked for more. I would purchaser again from this vendor with confidence."
5,Really Really - This is a GREAT album!,"Alex Lloyd's first 2 albums were good - if a little synthetic in places. This latest effort is exceptional. The songs are so well written they make you want to weep, the choruses soar at all the right times and there really isn't a weak song on here.The drum machine has been disposed off and it gives Alex Lloyd a rockier slightly grittier edge which really carries his exceptional song writing talent well.If you like Powderfinger, Pete Murray, Motor Ace etc (and you should!) then you will love Distant Light. Absolutely brilliant."
2,Are Klingons just plain boring?,"Is it the Klingons themselves who are boring? Or just novels about them? Though I enjoyed watching Hertzler's interpretation of Martok in the TV series DS9, I found his book tedious and never continued into the second book.Let's face it, although TV and novel scripters try to make Worf and Martok a bit different, Klingons are flat, comic-book Hulks who, in real life, probably would have killed each other off in the Stone Age and certainly wouldn't have achieved interstellar space flight (Romulans or no). Tales of Klingons involve one battle after another, each one as utterly boring as the battle at the end of STAR WARS 1977 that put me to sleep. Their social manners should be kept cooped up inside an insane asylum.They're not quite so boring as the faceless Borg or Jem'Hadar, but pretty close. Give me a complex Trill, Bajoran, or even a post-1991 Ferengi any day!"
1,where is my order,This was supposed to be available for immediate shipment. Why is it taking so long to get there.Is there a telephone number or email to contact Customer Service.
2,letters come off magnets,"The quantity is not great of most letters. We can't even spell my son's whole name at once, there aren't enough R's or even E's. Also, I have had to glue every single one because the back magnets that don't fall off, he pulls off. Bottom line, I'm getting a different set."
2,Cute design but poorly made,"These letters look nice and have that old-school wooden block design, but the magnetic backing is held on to the wood with essentially double-sided tape. As soon as I removed the plastic packaging, several of the letters lost their magnets. Over the course of the week, we've had to repair every single letter by sanding down the back and crazy-gluing the magnet back on. Just the weight of the wood block slides the magnetic backing off when it's on the wall. Also, the paint on the surface chips easily. If your child still sticks things in their mouth, this is not a safe toy."
4,An inexpensive way to keep your rings organized,The box came in what I expected. I received the case pretty soon after I made the purchase. Good seller.
2,disappointed,"I ordered two, but I got two same ones! I am disappointed. and it is not fine enough I think."
5,Began a journey,"I bought this CD as I had enjoyed another album by the Emerson String Quartet ""Bach The Art of the Fugue."" Although I am no musician I find their playing very clean and fresh -- lively. This CD played again with the same wonderful qualities. But in addition it introduced me to Edgar Meyer and Ned Rorem as composers. I love the Appalachian flavour in this music. I then discovered Edgar Myer team with the always expanding Yo-Yo Ma and now seek out Edgar Meyer more and more. I had owned this CD for about a year now and listen to it quiet often. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have. dsb"
2,Didn't eliminate all my static,"In the past I've used standard wired wrist straps, but dislike how they hampered my movement and how the alligator clip can disconnect easily. When I saw that a wireless version existed, I decided to give it a shot.While using it, I definitely discharged static electricity a few times. However, the discharge felt less than what I usually get when working without a wrist strap.While I love the idea, it seems it's not entirely effective. I would not recommend it for use with sensitive equipment."
2,NOT HAPPY with 2005,I've been using Money since 1998 with great success. I upgraded to 2005 for 2 reasons: the Tax cut offer and I could finally use online banking at my bank with the upgrade.Ummmmm....where is the bill reminder? Where is the cash flow forecaster? Where is the debt planner? These are all features I have used for the last 6 years with Money Standard.The only reason I can think of for Microsoft not making these features available in the 2005 Standard edition is because it forces users to pay the higher price for the Deluxe edition instead of getting the Standard edition for 'free' with the TaxCut offer.
4,"Works much better than other ""bargain"" drop clutches",The Gibraltar drop clutch works very well. I also have a Cannon brand clutch and the mechanism on the Gibrlatar brand grips the hi hat clutch with a much tighter tolerance (less slop when engaged) than the Cannon brand. The lever on this unit is also more ergonomically suited to my playing style compared to the other brand as well. I find it much easier to activate.
2,"Love Mushrooms and Spicy Foods, However...","I had great expectations when I purchased this product, however, I would not buy them again. I thought that the taste was too vinegary which neutralized the taste of the mushrooms."
4,I could relate to this story.,"This book is hilarious in some ways as I saw much of my own family in this authors depiction of a Mexican family... though we are not Mexican-American but Puerto Rican. Though, I appreciated the passion in which this author writes, the sex scenes were a little intense for me. There are a few dark parts of the book dealing with issues such as drugs, abuse, rape, and child abuse that were described so well that I was cringing. I was pleased overall with the general story. It was exciting, romantic, heart breaking, and funny. What I like most about this book is that it depicts a Latin American woman not as a sexy hot tempered ""fire cracker"" but as a real person with real problems and vulnerabilities. I hope to see more from this writer."
3,"Good movie, not as dramatic or long as Gone With The Wind.","This movie starts out similar to Gone With The Wind, but quickly moves in it's own direction. Bette Davis does a marvelous job without going for the Scarlet O'Hara angle. Henry Fonda's character is a nice mix between Rhett and Ashley. This is a good movie with a fast pace and a strong ending. Good for when your in the mood for a Civil War drama, but don't have the time or patience to sit through Gone With The Wind."
3,It is Written,"When I ordered this dvd, I was under the impression that this moviewas a ""colorized version"" and not black and white. (There is a colourized version of it). However, I was mistaken, when the merchant said that it was ""restored and remastered.""Next time, I wish that the seller would be more specific as to whether or not this product was colorized; then I wouldn't have gone thru the trouble of ordering it and returning it for a refund.Other than that, the merchant did refund my money upon receipt of the returned dvd."
3,Good movie,"Came fast, needed it for a paper at school, enjoyed watching it and made an A on the paper! Happy"
4,"a great precursor to ""Gone With the Wind""","""Jezebel"" is a marvelous vehicle for Bette Davis, and won her an Academy Award, although it may have prevented her from starring as Scarlett O'Hara in Selznick's ""Gone With the Wind."" Although it features a rather a pot-boiler of a plot, set in New Orleans against the gathering stormclouds of Civil War America, Davis's Miss Julie shines as a headstrong, passionate girl, determined to flout convention to have her way.Yellow fever, endemic to the New Orleans environment with its undrained swamps and bad sewers, strikes at the heart of Miss Julie's world, and she grows as a character and wins redemption in the way she meets a crisis.Davis is simply superb and makes the whole production come alive in this well-deserved Oscar winning role. Highly recommended."
3,dry rice and 110V only,"I had the same rice cooker until my nanny tried to cook it and put it over my induction cooktop.So I bought the same of the same brand but in Japan, here in the States. Unfortunately, this one works only in 110V and not both 110 or 220V. And enven if we tried to put more water than recommended, rice is always dry. I must also say that I can feel a strange taste that may come from the bowl.So I'm a little bit deceived."
4,The coating is not as sturdy as expected.,"It's a good cooker. However, the non-stick coating can be scratched easily. I think I'm a careful user. But the second day, I scratched the bottom a little bit when I was cleaning it."
1,Not Very Good!,"Just got this book and am disappointed with it. The book is ok if you don't want to read the SDK docs. You would be better off with the book by Crooks which includes some samples, etc."
1,Good Programming Books Are Hard To Find,"Sadly, this isn't one of them :/The author must have read the SDK doc's, re-worded it a little, then wrote a book out of it. Its worthless as a cookbook as there is no code examples and its worthless for learning as it doesn't explain ""Why"".I learned a lot more by looking at the SDK doc's then I did with this book. In fact I haven't learned nothing at all from it."
5,The Best Book for a Beginner!,"This book is easy to follow with step by step instructions & illustrations on all the basics. It takes you thru each step with extreme detail and helpful hints. I bought several books to help me learn to crochet, but this was the only one I used!I would highly recommend it for any beginner! I will also keep it as a ""how to"" reference."
3,worth watching: once,"As implied, this is # 4 in a series. I am not deep into these types of programs but I have seen all four.This is the weakest link, probably to keep the series going and make more $$$. The program is not worth buyingbut was worth the 1.99 rental. There are some interesting things going on out there, but I remain a skeptic tosome degree while accepting there are things we need to be aware of that have a basis in reality. This particular video was somewhat less professional than I would have liked, both in content and presentation. If there is to be a fifth, I hope it will be more specific in both the material presented and the editing. If you have the option, rent, but don't buy."
3,Tie it together,good info but not tied together as other watchers. new viewers would not get itPeople need to know how and where this applies
1,Not near as comprehensive as the title leads one to believe,This book focuses almost exclusively on a basic introduction to the ABAP query. Not more than a half page is devoted to Report Painter/Writer and nothing is mentioned about the Logistics Information System.
2,le creuset zen tea kettle is mediocre,"the pretty colors available for this pot are the only highlights. It doesn't have a lever attached to the spout cover, so you have to pull out the little round piece to uncover spout which is a little warm because the steam comes out a little. Also, the boiled water doesn't stay hot or even warm for very long."
1,Do Not Recommend,I would not recommend this product. I bought this when it was a gold box deal at a good price. But I typically drink tea throughout the day and with this pot you can't leave water in it or leave it on the burner too long after the water has boiled. Also I have to completely clean it out after each use because otherwise the water has a horrible taste.
5,Life-Like Figures from head to toe,"I have been studying the book and find that this is without a doubt the most comprehesive book on polymer clay sculpting that I have yet read. Her illustrations are almost self explanatory and what I found most helpful of all is the instructions on how to make the tools to carry out the projects in the book. Full marks Katherine Dewey, I await your book on Life-like animals with baited breath. Joyce Dunsire Jones."
3,a little over my head,this is a little advanced for me and not all that informative on different types of figurines. Need something alittle more.
2,A tad dull,"This 1975 production features interviews with many of those who knew James Dean best, such as Bill Bixby, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dennis Hopper. He'd only been dead 20 years when this was made, but he'd been a cult figure for years before. You get the sense that Dean was far more interesting in person than he comes across in the three movies he made or the very lame TV roles he did. This early documentary is interspersed with several jarring contemporary rock songs by the likes of Elton John. There's a lot of footage from his movies, which seem very dated today. Dozens, if not hundreds, of films have been made about James Dean who only has three film roles to his name: ""East of Eden,"" ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and ""Giant."" He always seemed to look much older than the ""teenager"" he played. Still, the various still photos of Dean are what made him the cult figure he is today, not his acting, in my opinion. This dated film is probably not among the best if you are curious about James Dean."
5,Still working hard...,"This pump has been working for a year now in my 2500 gallon fish pond and it is still working very well even with all of the battles I am having with string algea. I have to take the pump out of the pond every 2-3 weeks, take it apart and get all the string algea out of it that is caught everywhere inside. Even with all of this stuff clogging up the pump every so often, it forces water through without problems. I am really hoping this pump lasts for at least 5-10 years before needing to be replaced. I really like it."
2,328 pages for this!?,"Michael Gurian has certainly adhered to the rules for writing pop-psych tomes:1) Select a common-sense thesis, and tell everyone how terribly revolutionary it is by comparing it to dopey academic theories that have little place outside the educational/psychological marketplace.2) Take 328 pages to say 328 words (magazine article) worth of material.3) Mention ""the Gurion Institute"" ad nauseum.4) Throw in a teen co-ed slumber party as part of providing ""a home that is a place of family fun, healthy peer interaction, and attachment"".Save your money, folks. Better to buy some of Gurion's good reference material (this is where he earned those two stars) before he predigests it for you."
4,See girls for the unique and special individuals they are,A father of two daughters recomended this book to me. I really like its take on gender and raising my own daughter in this day and age. The Gurian book about boys was really great for insight into my son and men in general. I like Christianne Northrop's Mother-Daughter Wisdom for the mother/daughter relationship.
4,Easy to read and follow,"As always, dummies series of book is well designed for its simplicity, easy to follow and yet packed with neccessary information.Not for advanced search like boolean, - sign technic or multiple keywords search wth """" mark.Enough to get u started for sure.But that is a new type of search tool that can be used together with Google, try at http://www.i1254.comVery useful search tool indeed. May be next version the book will include a guide on how to use this search tool in conjunction with Google?Anyway, the book has no detail chapter on how Google name origin from, i1254 anonymous to i want to find for ???"
2,One of the few books out there about wood molding,"This book isn't very good. It has some basic drawings and tips on how to install some simple molding in your house for a beautiful look. The instructions aren't very complete and don't match up to many of the photos or drawings. If you're looking for a do-it-yourself book about molding or wood paneling, keep on looking."
2,Not a Very Good Book.,"I have relied on Cisco Press books to obtain my CCNP and CCDP. In general, I have found them to be well thought out, solid texts. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the CID. The course material and test are not on par with the rest of the Cisco certification courses. Comparing the table of contents with the requirements listed for the test on Cisco's web page reveals that entire sections such as security and VPN that are required for the test have been omitted from the text. I used this book and the CID by Sybex to pass the test. Between the two of them they cover enough material to give one a reasonable shot at the test. The passing score is now 75 out of 100 questions, and the questions on the test are probably the most vague of all tests - including the CCIE written exam. Let's go Cisco - get with the program!"
5,The Top 12 Resources Youth Workers Want,I really enjoyed the practical ideas when working with youth. You can tell this guy knows what he is talking about. Great book for any youth leader.
5,Mannix Season 1 - Brilliant,"It has been many, many years since I watched this on telly (black and white) and my fear was that the memory would not live up to the reality; I could not have been more wrong. This was a brilliant programme from my youth (I was allowed to stay up late to watch it) and it is even better with repeat viewings. I hope this flies off the shelves so that the studio releases the remaining seasons in quick succession."
2,"TV to make little ones to read, laugh when adults","When I was a kid, my mom watched any show with PIs. Taught me early to stay in my room and read.Some years back, she was visiting/torturing my family at some holiday and we treated her to a Mannix marathon on TV Land. It was eye opening how much better the production values are on TV today. Just on production values, mind you, Law & Order looks like Cleopatra or Lord of the Rings next to this.Walls always shook when doors were slammed which was one of the major action tropes the show offered. Also, for action-packed fun: Mannix running up stairs, Mannix running up stairs with his gun drawn, Mannix getting winged with a bullet.I gave it the second star for the years of laughs it's given my wife and I at thinking of my mother's goggle-eyed joy and adoration in this barely moving and hardly acted series. (I'd buy the old harridan the DVD, but she doesn't get how the player works after I told her that would happen.)"
5,Love it,I love this flag! It's a really big size (bigger than I expected in person) but it's really great. It's hanging on the wall of my room right now.
5,Just Classy !!!!,"I got this watch as a Christmas present for my wife and she cannot stop wearing it. She told me if I have to get watches for her it has to be BULOVA, they are the best !!!! I am a happy man !!!"
1,Highly toxic smell,"I bought two of these for my terriers. They actually have a nice design, but the smell was so toxic I had to dispose of them. Before doing that, I tried letting them off-gas in the garage for a couple of months, then washing them, and they STILL smelled highly toxic. That combined with being made in China convinced me to pitch them--the result being a waste of money and now guilt about sending them to the landfill."
5,Man in the moon stand,I just love this. It is amazing some of my friends see Santa Claus others a Nome and others see the man in the moon.It is so detailed. My best friend liked it so much I ordered one for her birthday. She was delighted. Thanks again Amazon.
5,I love the blinkers!,"I love the pet blinkers, especially for my black lab. I feel so much better about taking her for walks around dusk. This is a must-have for anyone who takes their dog out and about with them in the evening! The lights are pretty and bright, and they are very easy to use. The small/medium lobster claw clips don't fit very well around large collar tag rings. I'd recommend the larger ones for dogs wearing medium to large collars."
1,Poor quality,I bought two blinkers for my two dogs and neither one of them worked completely. They both seem to have a sort of short. I tried to check whether it was the battery but batteries are running fine. One of them is completly broken and the other one turns off after some minutes of use.
1,WORTHLESS!!!,"This is really a worthless item in my opinion. I took my headlight flashlight and put it around my dogs neck instead. The headlight cost maybe $15 in Target and I use it all the time myself, so a much better, safer option!"
4,it does indeed allow me to keep track of the dogs on night hikes...,"the clip-on feature is really convenient, but frankly the strobe-effect is rather annoying. (& yet I can't look away either, which compounds the annoyance.) I'd prefer the light just stay 'on'. I don't know if the dogs don't find it so obtrusive, but they haven't mentioned it."
3,"Better than most perhaps, but only adequate","Not the bowling ball sucking monster that some make it out to be.... it's still just a battery operator handheld. I should have known that the same inherent limitations existed in this model as well.Still, it's not a bad unit by any means. It works, it works well even. Just don't get your hopes up too high."
4,Great on hard surfaces,"This product is very good on hard surfaces. It doesn't perform as well on carpet. The charge seems ok, but we only used it for short periods of time, and always keep it charged in-between. Overall we'd recommend this product."
4,Good buy,"I've had this dustbuster for 2 years and it's still going strong. I keep it on the charger attached to the wall whenever I'm not using it. The sucking power was decreasing a bit and I just replaced the filter with the Black & Decker VF100H Hepa Replacement Filter (on Amazon at [...]) and power is back to normal. I do find that when using it, after a couple of minutes the power does seem to go down slightly, but the battery has never died on me. I've always had enough charge and power to clean what I need to in my house."
4,A better Dustbuster...Finally!,"Seems like they got it right this time with a more powerful version of the traditional ""Dustbuster"". I was pleased with the suction and power on this new model it's just great for those small cleanup jobs. Overall performance is much better than any previous model you may have tried before. As a handy rechargeable, this item is great for occasional use and works well on the car floor mats, small dry spills, other quick cleanup jobs you might have around the house."
3,good enough,Still don't find the cordless great. Much better than 10 years ago though. OK for the price.
1,2 UNITS BOTH DEFECTIVE,"After receiving the first unit I charged it as indicated in the user manual. when i switched it on it started making strange noises and smoking, it smelled like it had some electrical problem. I returned the item. After receiving the replacement, I opened the box and put the unit to charge it didnt seem to be charging. I called customer service at Black & Decker and they said it was defective. I suspect that they have some issues with quality assurance."
4,Great For Following Young-Uns :),"Since buying this dustbuster, much of my day consists of following my 3 and 6 year olds around and cleaning up after them :)Actually- I mainly use it in our kitchen and eating area to clean up our beautiful wood floor after them. Especially my very messy 3 year old.... he always seems to miss his mouth when eating. At any rate, this is quick, powerful, and affordable.My only complaint (minor) is that, on the charing base, the red light does not always come on when it is charging (even during times I KNOW it needed a charge). My understanding is that this red light is lit as long as the dustbuster is charging and then turns off automatically when done. Well, my worked in the beginning, but no longer does (and, yes, I checked to make sure it was seated right in the charger).All in all a great product!"
4,What to expect,"Can't beat the price on this unit. And it does work as advertised - good suction, nice design (don't touch dirt on clean out). I get a kick watching our 4 and 6 year olds clean up up their own under-table mess becasue of the novelty of this gizmo. Some here have said bad battery life. My plan is to replace it every two years for $35 if that's the case. More than enough charge per use for our kitchen needs.It is a loud little sucker. Be forewarned. And I find the wall mount a little difficult to use - maybe because I have it hanging back above washer/dryer - but doesn't latch naturally to me. Just a nit.I think you'll enjoy it. Would recommend it to family/friends."
5,Fantastic Product,"We bought this to replace an ancient dustbuster -- what a difference!The suction is fantastic, and the filter is effective and easy to clean.We particularly enjoy this for its bug catching abilities -- we have attacked moth and ant problems with great success using this monster. The bugs go in, but they don't go out. Highly recommended."
4,Charge,"In response to the criticism that the vac only runs for 15 minutes max...remember these are designed for quick spills and pick ups, not as a substitute for a full size vacuum. If you're using a hand held longer than 10 min., you should probably haul out the real deal."
4,power plus,"I like the power in this model. Has suction enough to gobble up anything I put it to. If you don't mind the noise (I don't), this is wonderful. Also, I was amazed it arrived so quickly. B&D 9.6V DUST BUSTER REPLACES V7210"
5,It lasts and lasts and lasts...,"My husband has a little portable vacuum and whenever I borrowed it I would have to vacuum very fast because it died so quickly and would have to be recharged every single day. So I bought my own vacuum, the Black & Decker CHV1400 14.4 Cyclonic Dustbuster. Now I can vacuum slower and carefully, and I'm happy to say that the charge lasts a long, long time. So I use it for a few days until the charge finally goes down, but when I recharge it, it's ready for use very quicky. I love my Dustbuster and highly recommend it. Great product!Shonsaya OwenPlano, Texas"
4,"Great product, great features","I bought mine in October after downloading the instruction manual. I was looking for something for time shift recording that was as easy to use as a VCR, had a tuner so that I could record something while watching something else, and would record on RAM discs. This met all my requirements and I have been really pleased with it. I have read that a lot of people have had problems with theirs, but so far I have had none. Recordings made in the proper format and finalized have played on 4 other DVD players with no problems. I liked it so much I just bought another one to replace the VCR in my home office."
4,"Lid leaks... buy the cone, ditch the mug","My husband purchased the Melitta for me after reading the reviews about the quality of the coffee and the problems with the lid. I experienced both issues.First, this makes a consistently great cup of coffee exactly the way Alton Brown explains it (see the Good Eats episode ""True Brew""). I love the flavor the cone produces, and it is easy to clean - drop the paper filter in the trash and rinse the cone.Second, after about 2 weeks of use, the top started to drip. My husband warned me that this might happen, and it did. So, I now either leave the lid off or use the coffee mug from QuikTrip when I want it on the go.Do you mind paying $9 for a coffee cone that produces a great cup of coffee and a throw-away mug? If so, the Melitta is for you. If not, try another alternative. Hope this was helpful."
3,Do not fall for promotions on Sabatier products.,"I purchased a set of Sabatier knives as a Christmas present for a family member. At this time Amazon were promoting the knife set by giving a free 7"" extra knife with purchase of the set.I have never received the promo knife. They informed me that the it would be shipped out on in late Jan., 04. In late January they said it would be late February for shipping. In late February they said my order was cancelled as they had not heard from me, even though I had replied stating it was O.K. for Feb. delivery.They cancelled my order, are showing no record of it so it cannot be traced. They say I am not out any money, as invoicing is only done when items are shipped. In this case, as it is a promotional item, I guess I am just out of luck. By the way, the source of the emails notifying me of the delivery problems is non returnable.Marti Massey"
4,works fine so far,kids very happy with it. it works fine. will be able to give a more definitive review once i've seen it continue working for a few months
1,do not buy this dvd player it is garbage,"i rarely used it. purchased it i march 2007. sony is making inferior products. player stops during playback, audio is horrible and the battery does not last as long as specified. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING MONEY AWAY!"
2,IF VIEWING JPEG IS IMPORTANT TO YOU...,I selected this model (after months of agonizing) because it was supposed to display photos in JPEG. Now I have the player and I read the fine print in the owners manual and find that it will NOT play Kodak JPEG's which is what most of mine are.Now I have to decide whether to return it and select a different model or give up on seeing my pictures on a portable player!
4,Great DVD player for the price.,I ordered this DVD player and when it came to recharging the battery it wouldn't recharge. I phoned SONYs customer service which seemed good. The woman had me reset the player and the battery was still not able to recharge itself. SONY customer service said they have been getting calls about the same problem with their battery rechargers. They told me to fax them my receipt with the event number which they gave me and they will send me a new charger. Its been over a month and still no charger. I contacted Amazon about the problem. Amazons' customer service is very good. They told me they would send me a new DVD player and pay for my shipping back to them. I received my new DVD player in a matter of weeks. This new players battery charger works. Thanks....AMAZON!!!!
1,This one's a Lemon,"I bought this cute little dvd player to watch movies for one. The styling is much chicer than the other ones on the market. The machine has two little speakers and a really cool remote control. Unfortunately, the sound is very tinny. For the best experience you should plug in some extra speakers or a headset. One other feature that they touted was a switch to use this dvd player for output to a tv, turns out this feature never worked. Also, after six months of use the motor is pausing seven or more times during a movie (always at the most dramatic turn of the plot it seems). I was so careful and gentle with this machine and it makes me so mad! Remember it's not 1986 anymore and Sony is no longer the hallmark of a quality machine. So, think of this as a cheap disposable trinket and you won't be disappointed."
2,Problems,"I really like this player when it works. The problem is the connection to the display. It went out when I first got it. Sent it in for repair, had to pay about $20. I believe it was just over 90 days. It's gone out again, blank screen but playes DVDs. Very disappointing. I've looked on the web and there are other cases with this and other models. I'm not sure about the design of the swivel screen."
2,Disappointing,I wouldn't recommend this product. I have had it for four months and already it freezes up and won't read discs. I was very disappointed in its performance.
3,Sony & Bose need to get together....,"Picture quality is so/so, need to look at the screen almost at a slight angle to see it better. From certain angles, the picture is not viewable at all. The sound quality out of the speakers is NOT great - using headphones however is a different story- better quality there.Wouldn't it be great if Sony & Bose got together to create a portable DVD player? Sony makes a good picture product, and Bose makes great speakers (as well as radios & CD players). Doesn't that make sense? HELLO? It's like Chocolate & Peanut Butter! Nobody's going to know how good it will be unless ya' try it!"
4,reincarnational,"Long, long before the druids formed, there was (is) a race of blue people who came to earth from a distant star. They came as teachers and friends and helped those who dwelled in what is now England, to understand the Nature of Reality. Stonehenge was built as a landing platform for their ship. Stone was the only reliable, nonmagnetic material available. Decadence set in and they came no more. Thanks for your fascinating books. jamie"
2,For neither the scientist or the layman,"As a scientist familiar with quantum theory, but not a physicist, this book was very frustrating to read. I felt satisfied neither as a layman or a physical chemist. The book quoted several key concepts of superstring theory but did not really explain them in a way that I felt gave me more than a very superficial overview of the field. The digression into twistors was made at a point where more space could have fruitfully been spent adding flesh to the concepts presented early in the book."
5,Tantrum Queen wears his Tiara,"Though not an Elton John fanatic, I was enthralled by this ""fly on the wall"" movie. Excellent concert footage mixed with behind the scenes documentary which leaves nothing to the viewers imagination. Bad language abounds, but it all adds to the magic of this no holds barred insight into one of Rock's most successful solo artists. Elton's tantrums are abundant but his performances on this documentry keep his tiara brightly sparkling. Excellent viewing, very highly recommended!"
5,Write options in a small package,"This is the perfect little pocket knife. Look at the options and I think you'll agree. It has the size of the classic knife, but you add a phillips head and a bottle opener."
5,Best pocket knife,"The problem with most pocket knives is that they really aren't that pocket friendly. Even when I have all sorts of pocket competition, ipod, cell phone, car keys with fob, LED flashlight and maybe a bluetooth headset too, I still have room for the Rambler. It is is just like a Classic except it opens beer bottles and has a Phillips screwdriver. Really it is the perfect pocketknife. I have many knives from Leatherman micras to huge multi-tools to Spyderco liner-locks but I keep coming back to the Rambler as the most practical daily carry knife around."
5,swiss army rambler,"This is the 2nd Rambler my husband has had. He thinks he can't live without it. He carries it at all times and uses it constantly. This is his ""McGiver"" tool!"
1,The Worst Movie,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The violence is terrible, the acting is terrible, everything is terrible. While watching this movie, I wondered why any respectable actor or actress would choose to act in this thing. There is virtually no plot, no substance, no good dialogue, no redeeming qualities. Basically, this is a movie that contains women being horribly beaten up while they continue to stare lovingly at their attacker. Do not waste your time."
2,Patently absurd...,"...is what the ending of this film is. A DA, two police officers and a surviving victim walk into the perpetrator's house, which is saturated in gasoline and alcohol, and not one of them smells anything funny? And, do you really let a sociopathic killer enjoy one last (fatal) embrace with the woman he literally beat to a pulp? This story is a ""noir classic""? Ridiculous."
2,Jessica Alba comes off well but Casey Affleck is all a mumble.,"Mumble, mumble, deadly Texas surface gallantry. Mumble. I ended up fast forwarding this film because of the mumble. I would have stuck with it because it really is a cold efficient character piece about a killer blending in with the civilians - has the same tone as Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer but prettier looking. Some people are just totally malevolent. It's really the mumbling that effectively walled me off from enjoying this movie. The old studio heads would have gotten him a speech trainer if they meant to keep him working."
1,Sick & graphically brutal,"This movie is truly sick, demented, and graphically brutal. I do not normally comment on movies , but after watching this one I feel ripped off at spending money to compensate people for making such violent trash!The Killer Inside MeThe Killer Inside Me [Blu-ray]"
1,A Complete Failure of Adaptation,"It is amazing to see all those rave reviews of this hollow and pretentious filmadaptation of Jim Thompson's book which I haven't read.That being said, it is obvious that Michael Winterbottom was unable totranslate the book into a compelling and coherent noir film like L.A. Confidentialor No Country for Old Men.It was brutality with no motives, causes or rationale.Casey Affleck failed to project this character either as a monster or a victim andunable to exercise his special quality as an actor.Jessican Alba was nowhere looked like a whore and not looking a bit like a bimbo fromthe 50's.Kat Hudson had nothing to do, likewise Simon Baker or Nat Beatty.Without subtitles, it was almost impossible to hear the dialogue.The final scene was totally ridiculous- stabbing a miraculously survived Alba while no singlelawman noticed the gasoline-soaked house?They deserved to be blown to kingdom come.What a bummer movie for a Sunday evening!"
3,THE KILLER INSIDE ME,"This movie was better than I expected. Jessica Alba revamped her sexiness, and did a good job. The movie's plot doesn't seem like the movie can be interesting but it is. All the actors did a good job, and the movie keeps you hooked and into it. I gave it three stars because it's worth a watch."
3,Confronting,I didnt mind the story but the violence was very confronting. The plot was interesting but just didnt quite deliver the ending that makes you want to watch it again.
1,The Killer Inside Me,I really disliked this movie a lot because of how horrible the women get treated and how they could try to protect someone as awful as him. I really wish I hadn't bought it.
1,REV drive not compatible with Vista Disaster Recovery,"I attempted to store a backup from Vista Complete PC Backup & Restore on the REV drive and received the error message ""Media is not UDF"". Storing a Disaster Recovery Image is the reason I purchased the drive. The drive is excellent for straight copying of files, but is not good for use with third party software. I talked to a Tech. support Rep., and he gave me the usual run around, saying if files can be copied to it, the drive is fine. They said I should call Microsoft."
4,wonderful upgrade,"Another wonderful product upgrade from Adobe. CS3 integrates more aspects from Photoshop, such as a full menu of ""effects"" previously available only in Photoshop. I am a professional graphic designer and use InDesign professionally every day and love it.One downside - when printing drop shadows to pdf and some printers, the horrible faint row or missing pixels around the drop-shadowed element is back. I'm hoping that upgrades will take care of this annoyance."
1,good for under 3,my daughter is four and loves my little pony but as cute as i thought this was it gets less interest from her than the regular my little ponys that do not talk/move! this is not worth it for older kids. younger girls might be more interested in the movements and pay attention but it still is just another toy that sings and does a little movement. dissapointed
1,Broke after a week!,After purchasing the Sing & Dance Pinkie Pie pony for my daughter it stopped working after a week. I contacted Hasbro and they sent me a replacement for free. I was very impressed with their costumer service and promptness. Unfortunately the new pony they sent out also stopped working within a week. We kept this one and my daughter likes to brush her hair and dress her up.When the pony was working my daughter loved it. She sang along with the pony and would answer the questions that Pinkie Pie would ask. The quality just wasn't there.
4,Definately a favorite (for a little while),"My 3 yr old played with this every day for about the 1st month she had it, now we're lucky if she plays with it once a week for a couple of minutes (and it sits in the living room in plain view). It is very sturdy (however somewhat annoying at times), but it was a definate 'gotta have' when she is sooooo into the little ponys."
5,Great for all kids 1 to 3!,"My son received this car for his 1st birthday and loves it!! He likes the music, likes to pull it around, and loves to put the circle in the circle shaped window - some day he will figure the others out! It is a toy that he keeps going back to and never seems to be bored with (he's now 16 months). The other really nice thing is his sister is 3 and she enjoys it too, she knows her shapes and colors plus just loves to play with it! It is a great toy that they continue to learn and play with!!"
2,v-tech choking hazzard,"Bought this toy for my sons first birthday. I love V-tech and have never had a problem. However, the sorter shapes that come with this toy are small enough to fit in a childs mouth. My son almost choked on the circle. Even though v-tech has such wonderful toys, I would not recommend this one. Sorry. I thought it was important for parents to know this since you can't see the size of the shapes in person. I wrote a review like this before, but Amazon did not publish it. I sure hope this review makes it onto the web so that parents can look at the toy first in person and then make an intelligent decision. Thank you."
3,Imaginative and Informative,The book introduces surprising characters with equally surprising dynamics between characters. The book was entertaining as well as insightful.The look at people in a country taking the first steps after colonization has ended seems accurate. Left on their own those newly independent peoples are like kids left without the babysitter who used to impose order. New freedoms allow for clashes between old customs and the old order that had been imposed by the colonists. The power vacuum leads to violence.The book also reveals the effect of the newly won independence on the characters who come to help and people that were born to the colonizers but are not among the original population of the new nation.
5,Best translation for all who study Spinoza,"This book is the best translation for the research of Spinoza. It provides nearly all what you want. The translation is faithfully based on the Latin version and the terms are delt with very carfully. But the pity is that I have expected the volume II from 1985, but it had not publish untill now. I hope Curley works on his translation, and see the volume II as soon as possible"
4,Fine & Dandy by Vicki Ohl,"I'm just beginning to read Fine & Dandy. I purchased it when I saw the author's name... a friend from my past. The book is well-written and most enjoyable to read... especially since I, too, am a musician and am particularly interested in the music composed during the era of Gerswhin et al. Obviously, Vicki has done extensive research and I have no doubt all the information within the book is quite authentic. I recommend it to others who have interest in these wonderful pop standards of this time period."
2,Who would publish this?,"This book was so... idiotic. Who would honestly not know they're pregnant for 4 months? Val is a girl that gets pregnant at 15 and thinks ""Oh yea, I'm getting married."" When her boyfriend's parents ""force him"" to go to a boarding school she's all crushed and says that they'll still get married. WHAT A JOKE! This book had to be one of the worst I've ever read, I mean what kind of teenage who's having unprotected sex think they won't get pregnant? My sister read this and hated it because it's poorly written! Who would publish this book? If you want a book to make fun of, pick up this book."
3,DALLAS 11TH SEASON,THE PRODUCT WAS ADVERTISED AS NEW BUT I BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN OPENED AND REPACKAGED. COMPARING TO NEW PRODUCT IN THE STORE IT DOES NOT LOOK PACKAGED FROM THE FACTORY. I JUST HOPE PRODUCT IS GOOD.
2,""" Wil not harm koi or goldfish""....????","This is an extreemly powerful chemical....unfortunately it killed all 6 of my small koi in a 20 gallon aquarium.I probably used too much....be careful to use EXACTLY as directed if you have fish.The quote "" Will not harm aquatic pond plants, koi or goldfish"" is on the front of the label.This is a dangerous statement."
1,Pheromone Failure,"A pleasant smell for one of the less expensive Pheromone products on the market, but alas it does the same thing as the others... Nothing at all. I bought this one a few years ago from another retailer and still have some. Once again money poorly spent. Wishful thinking and a couple of Andrew Jacksons will get you only disappointment if you make this purchase."
1,So Disappointed,"I purchased this fountain and waited with much excitment. I was so disappointed. It makes so much noise -- not the water -- but the banging of the bamboo as it releases the water it catches in the moveable spout. I had to tape it down so it wouldn't make the noise. I felt it defeats the purpose. So I am in the process of searching for another fountain to replace it and put this one in a yard sale. Foolishly I threw the packaging and documentaiton away so I am unable to return it. I'm bummed. If you don't mind noise it may be for you. But since I was looking for a calming effect, this didn't work for me. I must say, though, it is pretty to look at."
1,Stains,The book had what appeared to be blood stains soaking several pages and was a health hazard..It was immediately disposed of.
1,Save up and get the real thing.,"The reason I got this, was that I was in Provence, France 2 years ago and saw these knives. They were gorgeous, these have the name, but that is it. There are a cheap production model of the real thing. I was very disappointed. The blade is reminicent of the ginsu TV add product. The handle, a work of art on the original, look like the handles on the cutlery in a cheap picnic basket kit. I originally got these for my husband who is both French and a chef. I'm going to give it to my son (11), who likes steaks instead. He hasn't seen the ""real"" Laguiole, hopefully by the time he is old enough to know the difference these will have been lost down the disposal or some other fate.Like they say: ""If it's too good to be true, it probally is!"""
5,Terrific book.,I have read very few books which is technical though so interesting. It's bang on target and provides intersting tips to remember key concepts. It is very comprehensive as well. Probably only thing you need to pass SCWCD!!
2,read this if your only goal is to pass the test,"This book was largely a waste of my time. It's almost entirely focused on coaching you on how to pass the jsp exam. It starts out ok but then quickly devolves into cramming you full of what you'll need for the exam. If you want to really learn jsp, find a better book.Also, I'm not a big fan of the Head First style which is a lot like a comic book, with clip art pictures and dopey dialog. They're physically big books but that's because they have so many pictures of these people ""talking"" to you and faux hand-written notes. It's cute at first but wears thin and not productive."
2,Disappointing Effort,"I was truly disappointed with this book. Kathy Siera is a very prominent figure in the Java world, but the style that she uses in her Head First Series is just not efficient enough. In other words, for some working professionals like me, getting to the point as fast as possible is a must, and these head first books are not doing that for me. You have to work your way through, ahem junk, to get to the useful stuff, and you waste time doing that. If you are like me, you would prefer a book that hits all the spots in the shortest way possible. I mean it is not really possible to read 500 something pages of junk in two weeks and get ready for your SCWCD exam. I know I 'll probably catch hell for this, but I do not recommend Head First series to serious developers. Instead, I recommend the Manning Publishing book ""SCWCD Exam Study Kit,"" which also comes with JWEBPlus, which is a very cool test engine. Save yourself some time and stay away from this book."
5,Best book for SCWCD,"This book is just too good. I had thought of writing this review as soon I had cleared my exam this July with 92%. My apologies for this delay.If you would like to brush up your servlet/jsp/ tag libraries and appear for the SCWCD exam, then look no further. This is the book.With Head First's unique style of presentation, I just loved reading this book.I would say the book can improve more on examples and exercises. But whatever it has it really drives it in and makes your fundamentals solid.The exams after each chapter are solid with good answers and very less errors or typos as found in other books of the same genre.However the final exam in the book is much much tougher than the real one.Enjoy-Arijit"
3,A little schizo,"Mind you, this book has a lot of good info, and I don't regret buying it. However, this book doesn't seem to know its own purpose. From the writing style, you can really tell it was written by different people. At times, it's a tutorial. The first several chapters walk you through an example beer selection app, but then you don't really do hands-on coding ever again, and the app isn't referenced again until the very end. In the middle, the material seems geared towards passing the exam, but there is a lot of information, some well organized and some poorly. The later chapters are verbose and not as helpfully repetitive as the former chapters. It's a good supplemental book, but shouldn't be your main JSP book."
2,review,I think you should state the weight of the paddle in your advertisements. The paddle is much heavier than those of the more experienced players I am meeting. Their paddles appear to be a better weigh for me.Connie
4,American Gangster - The first & second Season,"Both DVD's deal with black gangsters and their survival in the drug world. These documentaries uniquely include the gangsters telling their life's experiences concommitently with law enforcement personel who worked their cases. Listening to these gangsters gives one insite into the criminal mind. Excellent DVD's for college courses in sociology, psychology, and criminal behavior, law enforsement, and criminal profiling."
3,American Gangster - The Complete Second Season,"The DC sniper is not Gangster in any way shape or form. If there is a season three which I am hoping and waiting for, I would like to see REAL GANGSTERS like the real 50 Cent and others."
3,It's good when you can get it to work...,This steamer works great IF you can get the cap off. It is so annoying to get it out to clean and then the cap sticks and won't BUDGE. I hate it because I can't use it when I need it.
5,Timeless Joropo by The Master,"Juan Vicente Torrealba is a timeless icon in the world of Venezuelan-Columbian/South American folk music in the true ""joropo"" style. This digital version of the original famous vinyl record album, Sol Llanero, brings true delight to those who love this wonderful music."
5,"Grab these knives now, before they are gone!","I have owned German, Japanese, U.S., Chinese and Brazilian knives. I have also used various Sabatier knives for over 10 years. They are sharp, well-balanced, beautiful and easily maintained. You can spend more money, but you cannot find better knives than these. At under $60 for 3 of the most useful and popular Sabatier Provence knives, I can't believe it's true. I have to look twice, no three times, before I immediately place my order. Buy these today, now!, before Amazon comes to their senses and either take these off the market or double their prices (which still will be a bargain). Just remember, while washing them, use non-abrasive sponges to prevent scratching and to maintain their beauty (as with all high carbon stainless steel knives or cookware). You will thank me and enjoy these wonderful knives for many, many years as I have."
5,kurt and christel...the best,we have first hand knowledge of kurt and christel...my wife and I have taken mucho classes w/kurt some w/christel) and their DVD is as good as their classes. they are great teachers and provide much fun at the same time. we highly recommend them (in the classroom and on their DVD.)rit g.
1,Breaks VERY easily,"Having used long tees for well over 10 years I can confidently say that these tees break faster than any other I've used. Also, they are quite thick."
2,cheap tees,"There are 100 tees in the pack. The bag is cheap, once you open it you can't reseal it. the tees are also very cheap, they break much much easier than other types of tees. do not buy for the price, there are better tees on amazon for 40 cents more."
3,"The book's OK but where""s the CD?","The book is fine for our 4th year Metallurgy students but neither the first copy or the replacement copy sent by Amazon had the CD-ROM with the MODSIM simulator relevant to the text. Apparently none of this particular text has the CD, and one of our students managed to source the book and CD from an Indian online book supplier."
1,NOT SHARP!,"I cook a lot and I just got these knives. Unfortunately, they were dull out of the box!!... I mean no edge whatsoever!!... They were not sharpened at the factory. The block is cheap as well."
2,somewhat works...,"This tool is hard to justify purchasing, while it can pick up a few things, it cant seem to form a proper seal around electronic chip packages, the primary reason why I purchased this tool. I haven't tried picking up much else with it, but it certainly hasn't proved useful to me."
2,Poor,"This cd is a very slow,boring recording from a very good singer songwriter. Jimmy Rankin is a great talent but he has seemed to lose his way on this recording.There are a couple of good songs Handmade,Sweet Wheels and Morning Bound Train are good but not what we expect from Jimmy. Stay the second song on the cd is mournful and just a terrible song. All in all if you want to hear great Jimmy Rankin pick up Song Dog his first solo cd. It is a much more solid effort and really shows off his songwriting ability.Hopefully Jimmy will get back on track with cd number 3."
2,Not for curly hair,"My hair has been limp and thin due to stress and lack of sleep. I read about this spray that's supposed to enhance and create waves in your hair in a magazine so I decided to try it. I have naturally curly/wavy hair so I figured it would make it more wavy, but instead it looks stringy and lifeless! I don't recommend this product if you have naturally wavy/curly hair."
3,Time warp back to the Seventies,"The horror flicks of the 70's are finally showing up on dvd. Like Gargoyles, Omega Man, The Devil's Rain and other genre flix from this period your memories will be fonder than the actual product. This is a good movie, and it makes me wonder what happened to Christina Raines. The movie benefits from a strong supporting cast, especially Burgess Meredith. I wonder if Beverly D'Angelo lists this on her resume? My only gripe with the product is the lack of extras. (All you get is the trailer.) I recommend this film."
4,Scary as hell!,"This is one of my favorite horror flicks. First off, any flick about the gate to hell being in Brooklyn can't be that far off the mark. Second, this film has more up and coming stars than most. How many stars can you name? Third and last, it has some really scary moments. It's a great date movie."
4,Another 70's good one.,"Quite an interesting story, but would not classify it as horror. It's a really good thriller, I think quite different from others and I would place it in my ""watch again"" stack."
2,Eh...,"I think I had real high hopes for this film after reading the reviews on here. But, I have to say I was disappointed. The acting was horrible, something like a bad school play. The characters were forgettable and the storyline wasn't smooth. It seemed real choppy to me. I guess I was expecting a real good horror flick, but it just didn't measure up. This movie just didn't flow the way a movie should. Sorry guys, this one just didn't cut it for me."
2,Look good but it is a poor made product,The bed look great. However it is a pain try to put together. The unit I got have no hole pre-drilled. We ended up drilling a few hole to get the screw in. Some part don't fit right and you need to drill a few more hole to make it fit. Overall it is not that good.
4,HOW CUUUTE!!!!!!,"WELL I NEEDED A BED FOR MY ONE YEAR OLD SON.IT WAS SO HARD FOR ME TO PICK THE PERFECT BED FOR MY SON.AT FIRST I WAS GOING TO BUY HIM A TWIN SIZE BED.EVERYONE WOULD TELL ME HOW IF I BUY HIM A TODDLER BED HE'D GROW OUT OF IT SO QUICK, THEN I REMEMBERED MY LITTLE BROTHER HAD THE EXACT SAME BED WHEN HE WAS SMALL AND IT LASTED HIM FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS.WHY SHOULD I NOT GET MY SON A COOL BED FOR HIM RIGHT NOW AND LATER ON BUY HIM A NICE TWIN SIZE BED THAT WILL SUIT HIS AGE GROUP?FINALLY I STOPPED LISTENING TO EVERYONE AND DECIDED TO BUY IT. IT'S GREAT.HE LOOKS SO CUTE IN IT.HE LOVES TO CLIMB UP ON IT, HUG HIS BLANKY, AND GO TO SLEEP.WE THEN GOT A BUNKIE BOARD FOR THE SUPPORT(THAT WAS OUR ONLY DOWNSIDE).OTHER THAN THAT IT IS A GREAT BED TO PURCHASE YOUR LITTLE ANGEL."
5,good deal,"the bottles arrived wrapped up indvidualy, but kind of tight in the box. none broken arrived fast and in good condition. thanks a lot"
3,GOOD PRODUCT - INACCURATE AMAZON DESCRIPTION,"If the description was accurate, this compressor would get 5 stars. Unfortunately, the description is definitely incorrect. Please refer to Porter Cable's website for accurate specifications.It only has a 0.8 horsepower motor. (NOT 1.5HP)Also, it is 3.5 SCFM @ 40psi.It is only 2.6 SCFM @ 90psi.Source:[...]"
1,Regulator Failed,"I initially was pleased with the compressor. Easy to transport and worked well for inflating tires (my main use for the compressor).After using the compressor for a very small number of times, the regulator on the compressor tank failed. The cause of failure was a plastic disk inside the regulator broke. An internet research indicated this was a very common failure, indicating a design flaw in the regulator, for the Porter Cable compressors using this style regulator. A replacement regulator from Porter Cable costs approximately $40 dollars and is not currently available.Until the regulator failure issue is resolved I would not reccomend anyone purchase any of the Porter Cable air compressors."
3,mixed value,This compressor is okay for painting a fence or pumping up the tires in your car or pressure washing but just do not try to paint a fender or car with it. It seems to have excess moisture and doesnt generate pressure consistently enough for quality painting of my mustang.
3,Pressure Switch went out,Worked great for a few years but then the pressure switch went out and would pump up and then let it out and then pump it back up continuously. If you are looking for a casual use air compressor that is reliable for a few years then it will work great. It worked flawlessly until this happened.
5,"Light, easy to carry, most popular borrowed tool in my family","This compressor weighs 34 lbs. Thats about 50 pounds less than the competition. You can use it to frame if you are sensible with your speed and pressure, it handles pretty much every thing else with gusto. Doesn't draw huge amperage so it doesn't pop breakers. Did I mention it weighs only 34 pounds. That means when your relatives borrow it they won't be sweating so hard as they lug it down the driveway. Reliable, very cool that they added the easy care handle and the extra fitting, still this unit is usually sub $180."
2,Not a long term rig,"Had mine for maybe two years, it had occasional use, nothing real heavy. The regulator quit, if you look around other sites and reviews you'll see it's a common thing. It worked ok for awhile, but it's not Porter Cable quality."
4,Porter-Cable C2002 review,"The compressor it's self is great. The hose that comes with it just plain ""sucks"". It is made from a stiff plastic and it has a mind of it's own. It will not lay flat on the floor and becomes a trip point. You fight it all of the time you are using it. They need to supply a rubber hose. I am using the old rubber hose that came with my old compressor."
3,dependable but LOUD! WHAT? I SAID IT'S VERY LOUD!!!,"Haven't had it long enough to rate its long term reliability, but for now it seems solid and leak-proof. Also pretty light and easy to carry, and has two hose connections. But it is VERY loud and vibrates a lot. I had it on an unfinished hardwood floor and it left feet marks on the wood, fortunately not a big deal since floor will be sanded anyway."
4,Porter-Cable C2002 Air Compressor,Never owned an air compressor before. This small unit is perfect for my small garage workshop. The accessories are NOT of a high quality; I would have preferred a few more higher quality and more useful accessories. But I'd purchased this unit again. The price and performance produced a valued tool for my woodworking area.
1,Never even got to turn it on,After reading all of the rave reviews of this air compressor I decided to purchase it at a local store. I took it out of the box and attempted to open the drain plug for the break-in routine. The plug was frozen and I had to get a pair of pliers. It still would not budge and the plug just broke off from the tank.This convinced me to get the Stanley Bostitch 1.2 Gallon air compressor.
5,Small but powerful compressor,"This air compressor can really pump air at really fast and powerful manners. This is really a great unit. I am very impressed, will be using it a lot in the future"
5,Perfect,"Worked exactly as advertised. A bit noisy, but I was expecting that. I've used it quite a bit already to air up bike tires, car tires, and clean up saw dust from work pieces."
1,Stopped working after a year,"After only 1 year, the vacuum sealer heat strip stopped working. I used the product to seal only dry good, so no liquids shorted the heating element. This is just a crummy product that breaks after about 50 uses."
5,A gem,"This is the most engrossing nonfiction I've read in years....Schwalbe writes elegantly, subtly, incisively and heartbreakingly. You won't forget his account of the final years of two old black men...The only thing this book lacks is somebody famous ""discovering"" it.....Whatever happened to Oprah?"
4,Yee Haw - perfect riding cowboy for my grandson!,"This Papo cowboy has great detail, especially his coil of rope and lasso. My grandson loves cowboys and this one fits onto many of his horses, making it fun to play with. Good for imaginative play and has held up very well for nearly a year. Pricey for one action figure but worth the cost."
5,Seller cares about customers!,"The mattress pad is fine and what I expected.There was a shipping problem that was traced to FedEx.Seller went more than the ""extra mile"" to address the matter.Would definitely do business with them again."
1,"One Star, Don't Waste Your Money.","Very much NOT in the same class as Clancy, Ludlum or Cussler. Couldn't wait to put it down. Whenever I read a book that resorts to made up weapons e.g. XE47 and ""AAyees"", it winds up being a disaster. The author needs to check up on his technical information. Nothing worse than an techno thriller that is full of technical errors. Parker is no Dirk Pitt or John Clark. Don't waste your money, if you want Clancy, Ludlum or Cussler, buy the real deal."
1,long read,This book has a good plot that is streched to the breaking point with long drawn out wording. Seems like the author just wanted to fill pages.
4,Dulcimer Holiday,"While this is an older CD, the artful light-hearted renditions of tradional holiday music are delightful...especially jingle bells! Surprising for all ages."
4,Great for Beginners!!!,"This video is great for beginners. I began using the tape over a year ago and still enjoy it. The video is broken done so even the most uncoordinated can do the steps. This becomes boring after doing the video for an extended period of time, but once you know the routine you can just keep doing it to keep your heart rate up! It's a great workout, and I still continue to do it twice a week. I have recently intergrated the TaeBoe workouts and also Denise Austin's Sizzler workouts into my routine. I believe Kathy's video has given me a great foundation to use these other more difficult videos. I am a mother of 3 children, so it's difficult to keep in shape. I think, the Sizzler workout is going to be the icing on the cake so I can obtain my goal in fitness and weight!"
4,Great for beginners and ones who need to lose quite a bit,It is great for beginners and those who need to lose quite a bit of weight. It is low impact and the directions and choreography are easy to follow. A great start to get the weight rolling off.
4,great dock great price,"This is a great dock, especially compared to the one made by Apple. Here with $36 you can charge your ipod and also play your music through speakers and also have a remote control. The Apple's dock costs $30 and it doesn't come with any cable. You have to use your ipod's cable to charge it thorough your computer. Of course you can buy a charger from Apple, but It's going to cost you another $30!! Altogether this dock is a very good value, it looks great and does the job.However, as mentioned in other reviews, the remote control doesn't work very well. You really have to point it exactly toward the dock to make it work! The volume level that some people were mentioning isn't really a problem. You just have to increase the volume with the remote control and it sounds great through the speakers."
2,"Nice design, well below average sound","Pros-High quality build on the dockCharges iPod nicelyRemote works very wellCons-Line out from dock is a joke; must crank up home stereo volume for respectable sound. I'm now using headphone jack until I find a better solution.Bottom line- I'm no expert but I don't think this is the way to go if you want high quality sound from your iPod through your stereo system. I cringe to think of the consequences if I leave my stereo volume up high for the iPod, then switch to another audio source...."
2,Fine at first,I purchased this dock about two years ago. It worked great and was very happy with it. So I purchased a second one for another room. Two years later the docks work fine but neither remote works any longer. Without the remote you cannot control the volume on the ipod and basically makes it useless.
2,"Wait... maybe this IS a great product, but...","I'm editing this review the day after I posted it... The problem that I was having inexplicably went away the today. Another reviewer had posted the exact same problem. Tech support said to live with it for a few days, and if the problem returns, let them know and they'd send a replacement. Incidentally, I bought the iPod (30 gig)to replace a 200 disk cd changer that died. WOW this is better! Also, I'd change my rating to 4 stars, but it's not letting me. Here's what I wrote yesterday: The dock works great, except I have to turn the iPod volume all the way up, and then crank my stereo volume up as well. I'll be sending this back. The first time I switch to FM while listening to the iPod, my speakers and ears are going to fry!"
4,Dogs big and small love this toy,"This is my rottweiler's favorite new toy. I gave the 4 star rating because the tennis ball was popped in one afternoon. That is more my dogs' faults, than the toy's(2 of my dogs are ""power chewers""). This is a nice alternative to the knotted toys made of string type materials. The rest of the toy is holding up well."
2,BIG mastering flaw...listen up!,BEWARE...Listen closely Gilder fans...What would be considered 'side 2' from the original vinyl:-FRUSTRATION-HERE COMES THE NIGHT-21st CENTURY-FLY HIGH-ROCKAWAY... on this import CD re-issue these 5 songs are all in a key one step 'down' from the original release.EXAMPLE- 'Here Comes the Night' is in the key of G on vinyl but is in the key of F# on this disc!Can someone explain why? My guess is the problem was in the mastering process??Tracks 1 thru 5 are in the correct keys..the EMI 'CITYNIGHTS/FREQUENCY' 2 FOR 1 is spot-on..and a bit more affordable! :)hope this helps...
4,Easy to follow & an execllent asset to Front Page 98,This book is a great beginner to intermediate aid to Front Page 98. This was my second choice after I had alreaded purchased another Front Page self teaching book. This book included some of the procedures my first book omitted. When this book arrived I was able to finish and publish my web site. I have not found any grey areas or errors in this book.
4,Easy for Self-Teaching,"I read this book with the hopes of teaching myself FrontPage without too much outside help. The book explains everything for the beginning learner and is also a good reference for those that need to look a few things up. Also, Mr. Karlins is wonderful about personally answering your e-mail with any additional questions you may have. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a FrontPage guide."
3,Easy to follow but leaves you hanging over alot of subjects.,"Content is good, it's just tells you a little about each subject doesn't go into enough detail on the more technical aspects like frames, java, using the database, ect... I only learnt about 7 things I did not know, everything else is all bluff."
4,An essential read for those trying to grasp the New Sciences,"Got this book on a whim. Turned out to be an outstanding book that for those steeped in the sciences, will find it nice to read from cover to cover. For others, it is an invaluable refernce guide.The authors have done a great job of writing the introductory pieces that fit beautifully. Initially, I put the book down after these essays, content in understanding thier thoughts on various aspects of the sciences. Later, I delved into the various terms that they have elaborated upon and found them immensely useful.Coming from the biomedical side, I'd have preferred a bit more information on biotechnology and medicine than what it covers, (hence the 4 stars).I highly recommend it to anyone with more than a mild curiosity in what is going on in the current sciences."
2,Misleading,"I do not often read very popular books but came accross that one. It succeeds in explaining many things easily, however it is very inaccurate and unreliable, there is an average of one fatal, major mistake per page, both concerning the interpretation, or the history of the experimental sciences, etc. The book has also very strong New Age bias in its use of modern physics, etc. It may be recommandable for New Agers, but for other readers I would rather recommend searching another book, I assume there are some reliable introductory books on the market.If on one hand as I was saddened by all the mistakes in the book, on the other hand I found some funny (e. g. that the medieval scientists believed that the planets and stars were alive or inhabited by gods, etc.)"
1,Terrible purchase,"I ordered the product 3rd. party. I called to track the package and Adorama said ""Oh that product has been backordered"". Well that was news to me. NO ONE let me know of that fact. I needed the background in the next couple of days for a BIG shoot. It is a good thing I checked it out. Terrible, Terrible!!!!! I ended up ordering it from Calumet and everything was fine! Terrible customer service from Adorama and AMAZON ESPECIALLY!!!!!"
2,I knew what I getting into but........,"as a sequel to the The Alien Factor this film just doesn't cut it. One would think that years later even if the ""aliens"" weren't going to be better executed, then they would at least be as varied and quaintly charming as I found the first attempts at FX in the first film. If Don Dohler couldn't convince his original partners in crime to participate in this film it shouldn't have been marketed as a sequel."
2,EXPECTED MORE!,"I originally read Beeperless Remote because I thought the story would be funny. I was only impressed with ""two"" jokes in that book. With the lastest book by Van W., I only purchased the book because it was picked up by a major publisher and thought it must be better than the first. While it was slightly better, I simply thought the whole issue dealing with the weight problems could be offensive to a sensitively overweight person. While I have never battled with a weight problem, I just found the book somewhat offensive and could not recommend it to my book club due to the sensitive subject. I did however, find some meat to the novel towards the end when you really began to see the relationship develop with the two main characters. Other than the ending, it was not at all a great book. The only thing I found funny was the bird!"
1,Zero Stars - if that were a choice!,"This is the only book I've ever begun and decided after one chapter that it wasn't worth the time to finish it. It's filled with wooden descriptions that would be an embarassment to a small town paper's social page. Why would we want to read an entire page (page 7 to be exact) that does nothing but list a bunch of names of black performers? Should we be impressed that he implies he knows these people? Van should definitely keep his day job until he learns to put his heart and soul into a piece of work,or don't write it at all. In a 7th grade english class this piece would be graded an 'F'. Random House should be ashamed of themselves for wasting the paper to print this when there are so many good writers out there struggling to get a break."
2,Time wasted is never picked up again . . .,"I don't live with many regrets but, my God in heaven, I regret reading this novel. The writing was borderline immature, and characters were too, by the way. Mr. Whitfield's skills are way too underdeveloped. The author obviously has no perception of what it is to be different. I sincerely hope that none of the readers of this book took any of that mess to heart. I don't think any person who is overweight constantly thinks of food. That's ridiculous. That's an addiction. That's a sickness. And none of the people I know live like the main characters in SWWYS lived. First off, what human being with decency would eat enough helpings for three people in one sitting? That shows some problem right there and was it me or was Mr. Whitfield 'pressed' about every other thing?Bad effort to 'really see' into the hearts and souls of overweight America, Mr. Whitfield. I'm truly dissapointed."
1,Get real,This book was about a man who was obsessed with food. I could not get into the plot because there was so much food being thrown around. Don't waste your time
5,One of the Best,"Jumpman is a brilliant book, you can't get much better. Can't wait 'till Jumpman Rule #2 Don't even think about it comes out. It's really worth reading. Buy now, come on just get it!"
2,no padding,Sound quality is good. Don't buy these unless you have no hair. There is no padding and the plastic grabs your hair and over time the lack of padding hurts your skull.
4,NE Patriots Kozys,They came in looking as they did on the website. I was pleased with the purchase as was the recipient of the kozys.
3,"Good General Info, but Lacking Info on New GRE Essay Section","This is probably the best general GRE prep book out there - definitely better than the Princeton or Arco books. The CD-ROM could (and should) have been a lot better.While I feel more prepared for the exam as a whole after reading the book, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of practical, useful information about the new Analytical Writing (essay) portion of the test. I found this information to be weak (or missing) in all of the GRE preparation books I have read.For a good overview of what to expect from the GRE, I would recommend this book above the others that I have read, but I didn't feel that gave me everything I needed.BTW - I FINALLY found useful GRE essay help at GREadvantage.net - an excellent compliment to any preparation material you've read. It's worth a look."
5,SAME LOOK - DIFFERENT BOOKS,"BEWARE! There are two different versions of this book. Although both versions APPEAR to be exactly the same book -- they have the same jacket, same publish date (July 2002), even the same ISBN (0743230299) -- they're not the same book. One has the changes ETS made in October; the other version does not. Chapter Four has been completely rewritten. Practically everything after page 125 is new. The newer version does not contains Chapter Eight, but has an additional appendix listing the most popular GRE words with their definitions and how to use the words in context.The only way you can tell the difference between the books is to open them and look inside. (Bummer!) The last page in the older version is 366 and has a CD with ID 136201-05. The newer version has the last page number 350 and the CD ID is 136201-06."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this hand vac based on the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, the reviews were all based on the corded model, and what I received (3 times) was the *cordless* model. The corded model may be great, but the cordless model is awful. Poor suction and cereal fell back out as soon as I turned it off. Purchase with caution."
3,Bag Too Small,This item is great but the vacumn bag is too small. Not big enough to use on the seats in a car (if it's clean).
1,"Wrong color, scratches easily","I was supposed to get forest green, but it came as black. This was a replacement for an old one, and after only a week in my pocket this one looks far more scratched up than my old one did after nearly a decade."
2,Simplistic and gets dull,"No instructions come with the game so it takes awhile to figure out what you're supposed to do. Once you do figure it out, it gets dull quickly -- lots of the same kinds of thing over and over just getting faster each time.The true test: My 10 year old said it was fun the first time she played it, but she has never voluntarily sat down to play it since that first time.I'd recommend something more entertaining, like Fizzball."
2,Not Blue,"The shirt came right away, was the right size and I had no problem with the seller just that the picture shows it is blue and it is in fact purple. Others have also complained so no it is not my monitor unless it is everyone's monitors. I have also seen this shirt on other sites and it shows a blue shirt. I probably will not buy any more of the shirts but only because I am not sure what the real color is. Otherwise I had good service overall."
5,Great Set!!!,"I beg to differ from the previous review. I just purchased the set and it's great. The handles have been enhanced with color coordinated silicone so they don't get hot. I even purchased the 12-inch skillet and the covered sauted pot because it's a wonderful set for the price. Regardless if you are just starting out or adding to your collection, this set is great."
5,Green Carnations next great conquest.,"Green Carnation return with an all new effort. This is an acoustic journey through the night. Acoustic guitars, strings, and strong vocals lead this album straight to a must buy. It is by these Norwegian fellows but it is not a folk album such as Empyrium, Nest, Tenhi, Ulver ect. This is acoustic rock much more akin to acoustic Alice in Chains or Days of the New but very distinct in its own style. This album should appeal to anyone into intelligent and well composed and performed music and not just the bands previous fans in the metal genre. Suggested listening includes Sweet Leaf, Alone, The Burden is Mine... Alone"
3,Half-cashed concepts,"More melancholic metal serenely strummed, with a share of hit and missed opportunities, but a majority of inoffensive competency."
5,"A turn from their previous work, but still great.","The Acoustic Verses is the only album driven completely by acoustic guitar I've ever heard that I like. The music, vocals, and lyrics are perfect and original. Also, every song sounds different from the others; it is not too consistent. Anyone who is interested in hearing rock music with acoustic guitar should definitely buy the album."
5,Touches Your Heart,"Turn to any page and you will be inspired and touched by a wonderful story. This book makes you want to just go out and embrace all of humanity. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will definitely feel the need to appreciate and respect all people for simply who they are. This is one of those ""Feel Good"" books that you will want to read over and over again."
2,you can do better,Minus:These were some of the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever worn.There is a hum/buzz sound when noise canceling is turned on.One of the hinges broke about a year after purchased them.Plus:The folded up very nicely when I tossed them in the waste bucket.
3,swap low frequencies for high,"all good 'cept for the noise cancelling which does remove low frequencies, but impinges on the sound a bit and ads white noise at a higher pitch."
3,ofgrace.org: Judeo-Christian Book Reviews,"I think LaHaye and Jenkins had some good doctrinal points, especially about the historical background of how apostasy crept into the Christian church. I disagree that apostasy is dying out [page 78]. You have to keep in mind that Are We Living in The End Times? was written in 1999. If anything, apostasy in the Christian church is spreading like wildfire. I think its rapid growth ""is"" a sign of the end times. Regarding Saddam Hussein [page 139], it is obvious that he was not ""the"" Anti-Christ. However, I have no doubt that the man was demonically-possessed by Satan himself.I believe in the pre-tribulation rapture. It is interesting to compare the different opinions in the area of eschatology. Overall, Are We Living in The End Times? by Lahaye and Jenkins was worth the read."
3,Its Okay,This is just one of those crazy movies that if you like horror movies then you will like this one
2,Big Disapointment,"I was so hoping for this book to be good, cool or something, but I was immediately let down. I have been using photoshop since version 5.5 and am now using CS3 Extended. I agree with the other reviews about the ""Trickery"" being very basic, unless going through blending modes is a trick. My biggest issue with this book is when they show an example of a step as an image then the next step is an image that says now do some more stuff and you get this. What the heck did they do between the two steps to get the effect. The $399.00 plugin is a bit shaddy as well, The book is essentially saying that you can do some of the cool stuff in this book as long as you don't mind the word ""demo"" all over your art work or are willing to spend hundreds of dollars more and have a PC. If you are looking for a book that teaches you things about photoshop that are cool and unusual try ""Adobe Photoshop CS Image Effects""."
5,AMAZING,"This was honestly one of the most fascinating books I have ever read - Ms. Worral's journal is an amazing account of what she went through, as well as what it was like to live an upper class woman's life during that time. And Princess Caraboo is possibly one of the most fascinating characters from history."
2,Motor Dies Quickly,"I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the weak motor. We owned the Dirt Devil for about two years. We used it sparingly and cleaned it after every use. While it was convenient and did a good job on the carpets, the motor burned out after two years. Given that this was reported by another user, it can't be an isolated incident. So beware when purchasing. You may want to consider a maintenance agreement."
3,Gerson # 1501 Dusk Mask,"This product is equal to what you might find in your local dollar store. The price when averaged is also about the same. I would have ordered the 3M bulk mask(s) but was wanting to save a few bucks (and I mean a few bucks). Not a bad deal for the price. If HIGH quality is not needed and a general use mask is what your looking for, the is a GREAT general purpose mask."
1,Disappointing,This felt like a compilation of stolen material and minimal effort. I felt cheated...Not worth your time.
2,"Almost So Bad its Good, Nah its just bad.","This book is terrible, This book makes no sense. The mistake comes on the very cover of the book. ""How god speaks to you through the Power of Coincidence."" Coincidence means ""the occurrence of events that happen at the same time by accident but seem to have some connection."" If god was acting upon your life, IT WOULDN'T BE A COINCIDENCE! The book offers a multitude of corny and dull stories. I recommended you not buy, read, look at, or be in the same room as this book."
4,God Goes Wink if we listen,This is a great book to start out reading about coincidence as it is easy to read. Rushnell talks from things that have happens to himself in his life and those he has heard of or from in his work. It is a very upbeat book and one where I felt I now understood some things I did not before and got me into reading more on the subject. It is light hearted and easy to read.
5,Highly recommended reading!,My Aunt guided me to this after the death of my beloved mother and the coinicidences in my life and why they occur. This book will make you aware of what is happening around and in your life!
5,Very inspiring little book!,Reading this little book always reminds me that God is watching after me and wants what's best for me. It's a comforting feeling - like knowing you can never lose you're parents' love.
4,Excellent pratical examples.,"This is the best Embedded Linux book I have read so far. The Author has an excellent approach on the subject. He takes a real life application and proposes real solutions. Another strong point about this book is that the Author use of 4 different uP platforms as example (i.e. PowerPC, StrongARM, x86, COTS x86). This provides the reader with a wide view of the extraordinary possibilities of embedded Linux. The Chapter on setting-up a reference development platform is very useful. This is maybe obvious for many engineer out there but unfortunately I have seen to many time that is not a universal approach. Maybe some of the scripts listing should have been left to an include floppy disk."
2,"Disappointed: Pretty, but tiny and poorly made","I've had so-so luck with buying jewelery over the Internet. One thing's for sure--the pieces are always smaller than I think they'll be. This piece is a little, itty-bitty star, around the size of a nickel. It is pretty, though: the colors are a nice combination. What upset me most was the construction. I assume the star-in-a-star should be one piece, but the diamond star in mine was loose from the sapphire outer star. I showed it to my wife, and she didn't think it was a big deal. She just sets one inside the other and sits it on her chest. Any moving around, however, dislodges the inner star, and it can become twisted. Jewelery on-line, other than from high-end stores with excellent reputations (Tiffany's, Cartier, etc.), is hit-or-miss, in my opinion."
3,"Good for beginners, but intermediate to advanced...","The book begins by explaining how to set up IIS and NT. That's nice, but, if I wanted to know that I would have bought IIS Unleashed and NT Server Unleashed.This book also contains JScript (not JavaScript) and HTML references, in addition to its VBScript references. This is good if you're just getting into web authoring. But, for those of us who are already familiar with these and are looking for a definitive language, DOM, and ASP Component reference, this is not the book.It gives some pretty good examples of some intermediate ASP techniques. However, this book's focus is NOT on ASP, but general page setup and development using ASP to spice it up a bit. This is an excellent book for beginners, just delving into ASP."
3,VBScript ONLY!?,"It does cover a lot of information but it could have been better if the information was essential and at least for the intermediate and not a complete novice!And besides JavaScript is mentioned on the back but instead JScript is covered in the book, but quite good. But the EXAMPLES... they are only in vbscript, by microsoft which are supported for viewing only by IE.above all this is a good book for the newbies + some good and advanced information on ASP (20pp)"
3,Victory At Sea....A Short Review,"I love actual, historical footage from almost any area of history, especially war. I have always questioned man's inhumanity to man and have sought to understand it by studying the context in which it so often happens. This was my main reason for the purchase.The narrator, Leonard Graves, does get just a little eloquent and poetical, even melodramatic in his presentation, but that is just the style of that day similar to Edward R. Murrow.The rolling sea is most facinating to me as the episodes begin."
1,Not so good review,There is no phonetic spelling in the booklet and this is is a big problem. I bought the Japanese version of this same product and it was very good and did have phonetic spellings.
3,Rip off,They charged me triple the cost of the tee's for shipping which I thought was crazy. I tried to cancel and they kept saying it is already out.
1,WTF?,"Wow, this was soooo boring. Very misleading how the DVD case said ""SUSPENSFUL!!"" Where? I saw NO suspense! Again the acting? Why was the acting praised, anyone can walk around with the same blank look throughout a movie. I watched this movie waiting and waiting for something good to happen...then the credits rolled. WTF? I was hoping that this movie was like ""Dancer in the Dark"", the shaky camera angles and the laboriously boring dialogue I hoped would then tranform into something even mildy entertaining. As was ""Dancer in the Dark"". No such thing happen with this garbage. I recommend this to noone."
5,The Son,"This stark, unnerving drama by the esteemed Dardenne brothers skirts the themes of reckoning and vengeance without committing fully to either one, yet it packs a mighty emotional punch. In a brilliant, haunting performance, Gourmet plays an ordinary tradesman whose motivations, like his emotions, are completely unfathomable: Is he planning to reform Francis, or kill him? With the Dardennes' tight, handheld camerawork, we are immersed in the claustrophobic, indecipherable world of Olivier's body language, and the effect is chilling. Once ""The Son"" gets you in its vice grip, it doesn't let go."
2,Waste of money!,"The backround of Cheshire Cat that is suppose to light up quit working after one and a half years. The watch still keeps time, but for $110.00 I expect the rest of it to work also!"
1,Really Bad Book,I wanted to learn about this subject and took the class from the author of the book at UVa. He's a pretty good professor but a terrible author of books. there are many usuage/grammatical mistakes in the book and its extremely hard to read. Doesnt make much sense and is highly not recommended.
5,Enjoyable Read,"I recently discovered Harlequin Presents books, and I have to say they're pretty good - short, juicy stories with a foreign flair. Lucy Monroe's books are no exception. In ""The Greek's Innocent Virgin,"" we have the story of Sebastian Kouros and Rachel Long aka Rachel Newman. Rachel is a sweet young woman who has had a longtime crush on Sebastian. Their relationship, however, seems doomed from the start. Sebastian can't seem to separate Rachel from her catty and promiscuous mother. As such, Sebastian is conflicted toward Rachel. A part of him knows that Rachel is nothing like her mother, but her mother has done so much damage to the Kourus family that he can't help but believe the worst of Rachel. Of course, like in all romances, the star-crossed lovers end up together, and all is well. ""The Greek's Innocent Virgin,"" is an enjoyable read that I devoured in just a few hours."
3,Unemployment Sure Doesn't Feel Nourishing,"As a graduate student in communications, I've been doing research for a paper on unemployment. As a result, I've purchased and read a number of different books on the subject including ""The Unemployment Survival Guide"" and ""Unemployment Boot Camp:Tactics for Surviving and Thriving in the 21st Century."" While both books offer some very practical insights into maintaining a positive outlook during difficult times, I found ""Unemployment Boot Camp"" by R.A. Long to be the more realistic and practical of the two. The ""nourishing meal"" concept left me hungry for something with more teeth whereas the boot camp theme in ""Unemployment Boot Camp"" is a great device to incorporate into a handbook on unemployment. And with it's chapters aptly and cleverly referred to as ""Missions"" and other military references throughout, ""Unemployment Boot Camp is a little dynamo of a book."
2,Check your order carefully,"When we received this order, we were surprised that we got two left beaters instead of the left/right. So make sure you check them in your machine as soon as you receive them. We are returning these and will comment if/when we receive the correct ones."
4,Great beaters for the price,Purchased these for my mother who was desperate for new mixer beaters and none were available in her area. She called for help and we found these beaters. They aren't an exact match for the damaged ones she was replacing but they work great. Thanks for offering them and sending them out so promptly.
2,This book is not worth your time,"This book was pretty lame, but then agin so is the band. I only read it because my friend is in love with them and I wanted to know what thier all about. I guess it had a lot of good info, but that's only if you like hanson. I'm not trying to give them a bad name and you should read this book if you like Hanson, because while it did put me to slepp my friend Alyssa said it was the best Hanson book out there and she learned stuff she didn't know { which was a surprize to me, I thought she knew everything about Hanson }"
4,Good.,It was good. Its worth a look. The art is decent and it adds more deph to the story of Resident Evil.
4,hard to put down such compelling and entertaining stories,"any failings in literary grace are more than compensated with simmon's ability to ferret out tale after fascinating tale. a great book for vacation reading, to redefine the meaning of a bad day, to put the mind in some unusual places. absolutely gauranteed to liven up the dinner conversation, this one goes straight to my 'favorite-book shelf for guests'in the dacha. if you like it, also take a look at Lansing's 'Endurance.'"
3,A Time of Tension,"A political intriguing story that makes the reader ask ""Could it be?"" The secrets of Washington during a time of tremendous national tension in the United States fueled by the Viet Nam war and the assignation of President Kennedy are the basics fir the adventures of a CIA operative in this thriller.Besides the food for thought there is plenty of action that keeps us turning the pages. Written like a true journalist with just the right amount of sarcastic flavor."
5,The Tears of Autumn,"As a baby boomer nothing stands out for me more than the JFK assisination and the Viet Nam war. This book is about both of those events, and gives an anternative view from any I have heard. I loved the book, and have passed it on to friends to enjoy."
2,Not the one,"I was looking for a CD of the soundtrack from a Sesame Street Special from about 15-20 years ago. That special was entitled A Sesame Street Christmas as was the tape I own with the soundtrack on it. The tape is fragile and I wanted a CD to replace it. Although this CD has the same title and the exact same artwork as the tape I own it is not the soundtrack I was looking for. It contains 2-3 of the songs from the special, but the rest is from something else very different. I am very disappointed and will keep looking for the original one."
1,Not a good charger...,After a month of having this charger it stopped working. I had bought it for my Fusic LG phone and even though it was a good price it just stopped working after a month. Sad....
4,Works,I got this for a original VX9800 I have that I lost the power cord for. I got it in the mail and plugged it right in and started charging right away with no problems. The only downside I could see is it feels a little flimsy but they get the job done and as long as I don't go throwing it around or treating it like garbage they will last a while.
3,Texas Hold'EM,"The Winner's Guide to Texas Hold'Em Poker was a good book for people to read on all Poker level's. You do find Warren Repeating himself here and there, I think thats just because warren is trying to get his points across, also I thought it was good that warren also showed that a hand could end up in a couple diffrent ways. Over all I think this book is good for some one thats just starting out or thats been playing for years, The points Warren get out is really a great reminder for players on all levels of play."
2,Good ideas but poorly written,"This book is (in theory) an excellent primer for the beginner, filled with good ideas and simple concepts. That said, I don't recommend it because it is poorly written. Much of the trouble lies in the use of ambiguous pronouns and demonstratives (e.g., ""that"" and ""which"") that have no clear referrent. I.e., you can never tell to whose hand the author is referring. Be prepared to read many passages two or three times. Cardoza publishing aspires to produce a readable book that uses layman's terms. A good editor would have really helped them achieve that goal."
1,THEY CHANGED IT & DID NOT THINK WE'D NOTICE!,"I USE MY MOMS (2 MOTOR)) PF ON THE STAIRS AND COUCH (I HAVE 2 CATS)AND IT IS WONDERFUL. I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TIME TO BUY ONE B/C IT DOES SUCH A NICE JOB. I ORDERED ONE FROM AMAZON. THEN READ THE REVIEWS AND BECAME CONCERNED THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE 2 MOTORS ANYMORE. I CALLED DIRT DEVIL AND WAS ASSURED THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN CHANGED IN THIS MODEL (AND IF ANYTHING IS EVER CHANGED THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THE MODEL #) THIS IS NOT AS POWERFUL. IT DOESNT HAVE A TWO MOTOR SYSTEM ANYMORE AS ADVERTISED ON DIRT DEVILS WEB INFO. AS A PREVIOUS REVIEWER DID -I WENT AND PURCHASED THE OLDER 2 MOTOR ONE(BLUE/SILVER BOX MODEL #M08240 NO CUTOUT IN BOX VS. THE NEW ONE RED/WHITE BOX MODEL #08240 CUTOUT/WINDOW BOX). THE OWNER'S MANUAL IS DIFFERENT, THE VAC LOOKS THE SAME BUT DOES NOT HAVE THE MOTORIZED BRUSH ANYMORE. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE AMOUNT OF SUCTION/POWER LIKE THE 2 MOTOR ONE DOES AND IT IS LOUDER. PRODUCT LOOKS THE SAME, BUT IT IS NOT."
2,"THIS HAND VAC HAS NO ""GUTS""","THIS HAND VAC HAS GOOD SUCTION, IT COMES APART EASILY AND EFFORTLESSLY TO PERFORM IT'S DUTIES WITH THE SHORT HOSE. HOWEVER, ITS ABILITY TO PERFORM IT'S DUTIES SATISFACTORALLY IS MARKEDLY HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT THE BRUSHES SIMPLY SLOW DOWN OR STOP WHEN THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH A SOFT SURFACE SUCH AS UPHOLSTERY, BEDDING, ECT.SINCE I USE IT PRIMARILY FOR CLEANING FABRIC, FURNITURE, BEDDING, ETC., THIS HAND VAC IS ESSENTIALLY WORTHLESS. IT REALLY ""SUCKS"""
3,Worked great until the nozzle stopped rotating,"It worked great - picked up all kinds of dog hair. Then the ""power"" nozzle stopped rotating. I thought it was all the dog hair. I took the nozzle apart (quite a job). The problem is that the small plastic gear on the end of the armiture that turns the belt is deformed. this should not have happened - I hardly used it. Now the question is whether it is worth taking it in for repair only to have this happen again."
3,great product poor glue,this is a great product the flexability you can achieve with it is great as well as the ability to tighten everything down and make it rock solid. the fault it has is that the glue will fail in less than a week so rough it up with sime sand paper and acetone and use some gorilla glue.
1,Retired,"This book, as compared to others on the same subject, is lacking content and substance. I would not recommend it to anyone if they are really interested in learning from the material.Don in CO"
5,A Great Deck,"This is a great deck, I have used it for the last six months and was delighted to find it so easy to use. The images on the cards are positive and I love the stories associated with the cards. I never realised that Celtic Mythology was so fascinating and could be used along side the Tarot is such a constructive way. A Great Buy!!"
5,Loved it!,"Until recently, I resisted comic strips because I felt that I was past the appropiate age to read them. A friend of mine, who is a fan of Housebroken, suggested that I give this book a try. You know what? I really enjoyed it. After reading the book, I make an effort to read this comic strip daily. I would like to thank the author for getting me back into comic strips."
2,Stabila Levels,I am a Trim Carpenter with over forty years in the trade. I have had several Stabila levels. Although Stabila will repair or replace a bad level you have to pay the shipping. I've had three Stabila levels go bad. When I buy a quality tool and pay a high price. I execpt the tool to preform as advertised. With Stabila I never knew how long the level would be good. They are prone to warping. On a job site a tool has to take it's bumps and preform as it should. Stabila doesn't.
4,"First one lasted 12 years with no problems, hoping for good luck with #2","In March 1999 we bought a Frigidaire Gallery stackable washer & dryer. The washer just recently conked out on us - the bearings or struts or something like that broke off and the drum no longer rotates correctly. I'm a little disappointed because I think 12 years isn't a very good lifespan for an appliance, but after doing some internet research, it appears 10 years is the average for a washer, so I guess I should appreciate that we apparently got 2 extra years out of it. Our model number for the now defunct 12-year old washer is Frigidaire 417.39012890, but it looks the same as this Frigidiare FTF530FS model (minus the blue highlights around the knobs). Since we were happy with what we had, we're going the same route again and getting this FTF530FS from our local appliance dealer, even though it appears that most of the people posting reviews here haven't had good experiences with this model."
2,Book of Opinions not a book of Science,"The only strebgth of this text is its extensive coverage of the subject, but that is where the kudos end.As a Paleontologist and Paleoantropologist I find that this is more about citing exampleas and then giving personal opinion, than the facts. I must say I agree with the review of ""justice209"" (Fargo, ND USA), that ""I felt more and more like I was in church and not reading a college textbook."" Many Intro courses in Anthropology use this text, probably more for the inclusive CD-ROM and InfoTrac than the text. This text should be supplemental reading for an Intro course, not required reading. I don't know if I would go so far as stating that W.A. Haviland is putting forth a political agenda, but I find this text lacking on scientific, with to many opinions put forth lacking any supportive fact."
5,This game makes you pay attention,"Our entire family has fun with this game. It really makes you pay attention and rely on your memory, or lack there of. It would be nice if there were cartridges that could be changed out after you've mastered or grew tried of the first set of phrases to unscramble.Apparently you need to be more gentle when rearranging the order of the balls because we often get the message ""you're missing a ball"" when they are all actually in their place.Overall this is a fun game."
4,"Great toy, but I have a suggestion...!!","This is a very well made and unique toy! The multilevels and multi player options are great! The multi-versions (time based, number of attempts based, etc) means that my 9 year old, my 11 year old, and my wife and I can all enjoy different challenges! The game is a combination of ""Simon"" (okay I am 42 years old - that was the first memorize the lights-and-beeps genre toy back in the '70s) and a crossword puzzle, with Trivial Pursuit thrown in! It is funny to purposefully mix up some of the phrases, too! My ONE suggestion that would give 5 stars from me, is if additional ""puzzles"" could be uploaded into the game console! It would seem possible technically. The company could even sell them, we'd buy! (P.S. if that capability exists and I just missed it, please let me know!)"
5,Just an awesome game!,"I got this game for my 14 year old daughter. This can be a hard age to buy for but if the child watches tv (what 14 year old doesn't) then they can play this game. The whole concept of the game is to take out of order phrases and put them in order and you only get a short amount of time or number of turns to do it in. These are very common phrases made popular by tv shows, movies, advertises and music lyrics. In addition to my 14 year old, her 10 year old sister also plays it and a 'smart as a whip' 5 year old friend of the family didn't do too bad either (not recommended for quite that young though).This game can be played alone or with others (up to 5 players) so it's a great game for those boring times or with friends."
5,Exciting,"This game was purchased for a 7 years old -- it's a little over her head. However, my brother (38) and I (42)have a blast with it. God for training memory and speed!!!!! My 7 years old does give it a try and has managed to throw a few phrases together in the begiinning 30 second rounds, but some of the phrases go back a few years and she doesn't know them.Overall, GREAT game and worth the money! GO FOR IT!"
2,a little disappointed,"I bought this game for my 10 yr old daughter but I played with it a few times after she said ""it stunk"". I thought is was a little hard with very few trys allowed."
1,Not worth the money,The tail tore off the sponge fish during the first use. The paints aren't dark enough to see when smeared on the shower wall.
1,Stains grout! And very underwhelming on tile.,"The perfect recipe for a lousy tub toy: the paints stain grout in the tub and barely show up on the tile, frustrating my toddler. We tossed these in the trash after one use."
2,Not so good....,"It smells really good, but as with the other reviews, the paint does not show up on the walls. My daughter still likes to smear it on herself, but the colors still don't show up very well. We bought colored shaving cream and she has a lot more fun with that! Also, if you buy the Crayola washable crayons, they write on skin really well if they are wet and wash right off! She has a lot more fun with those! I haven't tried them on the walls yet, it will be interesting to see how washable they are there."
2,Bathtub Finger Painting Kit,"While the packaging is adorable, the paint does not color on the tub. You can go thru a whole box trying to get a hue on the tile/tub. Waste of money"
2,Finger Paint Failure,"My son got this for his 3rd birthday and I was really disappointed with the finger paint soap. My son tried and tried to paint on the walls and the soap/paint wouldn't write well on the walls, although the box to the kit shows how ""excellent"" the paint shows up. I was very disappointed with this product."
5,Planning First - Learning Always,"If you have ever been involved in a strategic planning effort that fell short of expectations then this book is for you. In plain language the authors lay out a planning framework with supporting involvement practices to gain organizational buy-in. They provide explanations and case study examples to show the connections between ""what needs to be done and how to do it."" A chapter titled ""The Toolbox"" covers the rational and procedures for involvement mechanisms that include ""Nominal Group Process to generate ideas, Affinity Diagrams & Mindmaping to organize complex issues and Collapsing Consensus & Las Vegas Voting to help in problem solving & decision-making."" There are valuable discussions on organizing the planning effort and post-planning followup / accountability. This volume supports any organizational effort to set goals, improve quality or enhance effectiveness in resource management through collaborative processes."
5,Great resource for planning in a school district.,"We have used these activities in a highly inclusive strategic planning process in our school district. We wanted to involve many different stakeholder groups (parents, teachers, students and community members) in our district-wide planning effort. Participants enjoyed these activities. Our district now has a vision of the future that people are proud of and an implementation plan to make it work."
4,I saw one of the authors at a planning meeting and......,"I was motivated to get this book. The ideas are MAGIC!! I saw how to make planning fun , interesting and practical. Now I can do the same. One of the best books I have seen on the subject."
1,Show me the filters,"What good is a bagless/dustless vacuum when replacement filters are nowhere to be found? I've searched the Net far and wide and have turned up empty-handed. You would think that ... would at least stock them as a service to its customers. Also, the design is flawed. The handle to the dirt compartment is positioned right above the handle for carrying the vacuum. Imagine the mess you'll have on your hands when you accidentally unhinge the dirt compartment thinking you're reaching for the carrying handle. Alas, you get what you pay for. Please-- do yourself a favor and pass on this one!"
1,I want to give more,"I'd love to give this a higher rating but the way the author used the Jewish character totally turned me off. Jews are common characters in works of scientific fiction. They are heavily represented in the sciences, are the root religion of Christianity and Islam and are the originators of Kabbalah. Science, religion and mysticism, what could be better in a character. Problem is, authors are bound by untrue steriotypes when it comes to Jewish family life and it comes out in their works. I've known many types of Jews in my life from anti-religious to named Hasidish Rabbis. I've never seen a family where the husband denigrates and controls his wife as put forth in this (and other) books. Purpetuating this steriotype is one I can't hold by which is why I rate this book so low.If not for this, my rating would be higher."
1,One for the bin,"I have read lots of SF books during the last 25 years - from big antologies to 50c-books - sometimes I have been thrilled, sometimes disappointed, very very rarely I got rid of the book after reading --- but Dante's Equation is ready for the bin.The reasons are (as Andrew Ross mentioned in his review):Flat and stereotypical characters, weak and ridiculous (b/c not believable) concept - if you want to write Hard SF you should try much harder."
1,Quack Science At Its Worst,"This book is an unfortunate combination of quack science, astrology, reckless speculation, and subjective religious visions. Some parts of the book are totally bizarre such as the story of the author's trip to Hong Kong. After the first few chapters, traditional rules of English spelling and grammar are forgotten and occasionally the author slips off into total incoherence.The author understands ""The Way of Melchizedek"" to be the conclusion that all churches are apostate, and that each Christian should have a private walk with God. But the Old and New Testament passages about Melchizedek--Genesis chapter 14, Psalm 110, and Hebrews chapter 7--make exactly the opposite point. In the normal course of business, salvation comes through membership in God's Church.Amazon has a great many books available which are well worth buying. Unfortunately this book is not on that list."
4,Cow Christmas - Holiday Silliness,"Cow Christmas is a delightful collection of silliness. The Twelve Days of Christmas is the funniest song and we quote it often: ""I HATE poodles!"""
5,"Attractive, well made, functional",We bought this to grind our own meat. The theory being ground turkey is $5 a lb and whole chicken breast is $1.50.The machine is attractive and the components are well made. It feels like this is something that can be passed down to our kids in 20 years. A rarity today with hundreds of cheap and gimmicky kitchen gadgets flooding the market.
5,Finally Satisfied,"I had ordered this same product from another company through Amazon marketplace and after a month never received it nor did I get a tracking number. Amazon refunded my money back to me and I ordered another mixer through Amazon themselves and had it within a couple of days.I LOVE MY NEW MIXER!!! It works great, especially mixing oatmeal cookies!!T.Hester"
5,Everything I always dreamed of....,"I have been wanting a KA for a long time. I have always just thought it'd be one of those things I'd wait to get married and then get. The sale was so good last week I could not pass this up. So far I have made the best meringue cookies I have ever had and there is a meatloaf cooking right now. It arrived quick, is flawless and absolutely amazing. The clean up is a snap."
1,"Gets hot, mixing bowl does not anchor properly","Bought this mixer 6 months ago. Have used it only a few times for easy (i.e.soft) baked goodies. Simply creaming sugar and butter leaves the mixer scary hot and smelling like it's starting to burn. It seemed loud and it rumbled and bounced a lot while mixing.Tonight I tried making a wet dough (imagine thick pancake batter). Needed to mix 12 minutes on medium - longest I've ever mixed something. It was banging and rocking and thumping all over the counter. We found it was because the bowl would not twist into it's dock. If you forced it in, there was NO WAY you'd ever get it off again. I was afraid of warping the bowl, seizing the motor, or knocking the paint off the paddle with my attempts at mixing...so why use it at all???!Oh, and med and high mixing speeds don't seem to be any different.I wrote to Kitchenaid and am awaiting a response. Right now, it feels like a very expensive, giant paperweight."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I have always heard great things about KitchenAid, and started wanting one as I became more of an active baker. I was thrilled to see Amazon have this on their GoldBox deal one day, and quickly purchased it.I am sorry to say that my experience with this KitchenAid model has been terrible. It sounds awful when mixing, and eventually starts bouncing across the counter. I called customer service...they ARE very helpful and polite, and will ship you a replacement within a week. The trouble is that I am currently on MY FOURTH APPLIANCE. I am stubborn and hope that I have just had bad luck--so I keep calling them--but judging from the other reviews, it is just a crappy product. Each time I have mixed nothing thicker than icing, and within 4-5 sessions of use it starts this bouncing act.I will give them one more chance, but plan to ask Amazon for a return/refund if the next one stinks as well."
5,Great Mixer,"I finally gave in and bought the Kitchenaid Artisan mixer after using a hand mixer for years. This mixer is awesome. Works great and saved my tired arm from another workout. Blended the batter throughly without my stopping it. Wished I could have gotten the cinnamon color but saved a lot of money getting the white. Only negative is it's weight (husband has to take it out of the cabinet for me), but I guess that's part of what makes it so substantial.Treat yourself it is well worth the money. Also I could not find it cheaper then on Amazon."
5,Kitchen Aid Mixer,I really love this mixer its just what I wanted. As advertised and what I like most is the color and price. I would recommend this for anyone who is in the market for a heavy duty mixer it has style and performance.
5,"Finally,I'm mixing in style.......","I tried and tried to sabotage my old beat-up Hamilton Beach mixer but the thing kept on going! However,when I saw the unbelievable low price on the Artisan in Empire Red no less,well I fell in love. I anxiously awaited its arrival like a first date and,as I hoped,I'm still in love after using my beautiful Kitchenaid Artisan for many previously difficult tasks. I'm confident that my ""affair"" will continue and grow for many years especially since this gorgeous appliance is built like a fine car. Oh,by the way,I maintain my relationship with my old mixer and occasionally use it for those quick and easy jobs for old times sake!"
5,great mixer,"This stand mixer is built like a tank,I ordered it Dec.26 and Amazon had it delivered to me on Dec.28. with free shipping. Really liked the special price on the white colored mixer."
4,More of a customer service review,"Unfortunately for me, the first unit I had was defective due to a loose arm so it constantly rattled during mixing. I wasted half a hour talking to the Kitchenaid customer rep who was nice, but clearly did not want to make a warranty issue out of it. She spent over 5 minutes asking me what kind of recipe I was using (i told her my recipe called for 11 ounces of flour, and she asked me how many cups that was?!). After making me tighten all the screws that were in the machine, she still evaded me when I asked for a simple replacement and basically told me to call them back after I try some more (like I didn't try hard enough while on the phone for 30 minutes)Thankfully Amazon came through- called their customer service number and got an exchange that was shipped next day air. While many people here had good experiences with KA customer service, mine was quite neutral.The new machine works great of course. Buy your Kitchenaid from Amazon :)"
1,Artisan look but does not work,"The appliance is only good as a decoration in your kitchen, or perhaps if you use it once a month. After two years of use (about twice a week) in making bread a small plastic white gear in the box wore out and the machine stopped."
5,I love my KitchenAid,"I rec'd one for Christmas from my hubby and I make something new almost everyday. I love it, I love it, I love it! everything I've made so far has turned out awsome. Breads/cookies/cinnamon rolls/etc... It's easy to clean and easy to use."
3,Mixer gets better with time!!!!,"After years of hearing how necessary a stand mixer is we took the plunge. Our hand mixer of many years was defeated by some thick cookie dough.The 5 quart bowl seems a bit small ( we have double convection ovens so double cookie batches are the norm) and, with cookie and cake dough, there seems to be a dry residue at the bottom of the bowl. It is inconvenient to stop and scrape over and over.Yesterday we used it to start pizza dough....that was terrific.This mixer is a good bread dough device but a good hand mixer is still preferred for many batters.Of course, everyone we know raves about the mixer....maybe we are missing something....or maybe they haven't used a hand mixer!Update time. As time has passed we have come to love the mixer for everything. If you like to bake...you need this mixer!"
1,part is missing,"I am not satisfied with this purchase. Unfortunately, one part was missing which makes me think that I got a refurbished unit. The attachment hub cover which has the “KitchenAid” logo on it was not in the box. Because this was a gift I don’t want to send it back for replacement but the ugly opening on the front has to be covered. Please have this part sent to me as soon as possible. Thank you."
2,Kitchen Aid doesn't Mix Well,"After years of wanting the convenience of a stand mixer, I got a KitchenAid Artesian 5 qt. It doesn't mix the product at the bottom or sides of the bowl. You have to turn the mixer off, lift the beater, remove the bowl, then mix by hand to ensure proper mixing. I also have the pouring attachment; I'd advise not wasting your $$ on this one. There's not enough room to add ingredients without making a mess, and the plastic pieces come apart too easily. If it wouldn't make my husband unhappy that he'd purchased such an expensive pink elephant, I'd return it."
4,Kitchenaid Artisan Stand Mixer,"I absolutely love the mixer. I have been putting off buying it because of the price, but am glad I finally did, especially just before baking holiday cookies and breads. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the first one came with 3 scuff marks. Amazon was great about exchanging it and I got the replacement in about a week, but the replacement also has a scuff mark on it. I really wanted it to bake cookies and after two tries, I just gave up, but wish it was in perfect condition. I bought the platinum chrome finish and like the way it looks in my kitchen with my stainless appliances. I normally don't leave my small appliances out, but because I've been using it often and it is so heavy, I will probably leave it on my counter. The food I've made in it has been great - and it is very easy to clean!"
4,"Very good, but not perfect","I love my mixer, but there's 2 drawbacks. One, when it's kneading dough for a period of time, you have to watch to make sure the little round metal bar that functions as the hinge between the top and the bottom of the mixer doesn't vibrate loose. It would be better if that was more permanently attached. I have to sometimes physically keep a finger on it so that it doesn't vibrate loose.Two, when mixing, the beater attachment doesn't quite get to the very bottom of the bowl. When I make cookies, I have to stop the machine at least once to use a spatula to stir up the bottom to make sure it gets mixed in properly.On the positive side, it's of course a very solid machine and still runs as good today as when I bought it 3 years ago."
5,Awesomeness,This mixer is a monster. I absolutely love it. I know it will be around for my kids and probably their kids too. Extremely durable and powerful. You can just tell it is well made. LOVE it. This item was on my list of wants for a long time. One of the best purchases I ever made. It is everything I expected and more!
5,Everyone needs one!,"I love my new KitchenAid mixer!! After many long hours of reviews & suggestions from friends, this is the mixer I chose and I am so glad that I did. It is well worth the money, I kept watching for a good sale and I got it at Amazon!!"
5,Couldn't be happier,This mixer works great. I have no complaints other than it is a little louder than I expected.
4,Love it!,"I really love my new Kitchenaid. I have wanted it for a very long time but they usually cost so much. However, I kept checking on Amazon and saw the price go lower and lower and jumped on it. I have no regrets and my husband who thought it would be another appliance that just sits there has had to eat his words."
4,kitchen aid mixer,this item was purchased for a gift which has not been given yet. Item was received very promptly and I am very pleased with the great service.
1,Disappointment,"My mother had a KitchenAid Accolade that I absolutely loved. Unfortunately the Accolade was discontinued in 2006. I purchased the Artisan because I wanted a tilt head stand mixer and it seem like the best alternative to the Accolade. I am extremely disappointed in this mixer it can barely handle one batch on cookies. Whenever I make cookies the mixer is very loud, it skips and jumps about a 1/4 inch off the counter. I wish I could give this mixer a higher review but I feel like it is not stable and may break soon."
5,An excellent choice,"With its added power and additional bowl size, I can easily double the recipes with no problem"
5,love it !,"I had always wanted one of these mixers , but I was not sure if I would use it enough & I do really love it !"
5,Should of bought this ages ago!,"I love everything about this mixer. The quality, the heft, the ease of use, the color....It's so pretty that I leave it out on the counter. It's so easy to use that just looking at it inspires me to cook. I haven't bought any of the special attachments yet, but I'm compiling a list. After reading other reviews, I expected to run across a few minor ""issues"", but, I just haven't! This is a well built, easy to use, pretty mixer that does everything you'd expect a mixer to do. From cakes, bread, pizza dough, whipped cream to simple mashed potatoes. It does the job with little fuss."
4,So far so good....,"I bought the Kitchen-Aid mixer for my girlfriend for her birthday. The box was beat to ""heck"" and the mixer was shipped directly in the kicthen-aid's box without any additional protection from the shipping process. I was a bit surpirsed to see the box so completely beat up and even torn, but fortunately the mixer appeared fine, and so far it seems to operate normally.Anyway, she loves it and has been putting it to good use mixing and baking loads of goodies...I can hardly even get into the kitchen these days. ;-)I would certainly recommend a kitchen-aid mixer to anyone on the fence of purchasing one. Yes, kitchen-aid is expensive, but it's quality, and should last for years to come, given it survives the shipping process...."
5,kitchenaid artisan stand mixer,"I HAD BEEN WANTING THIS MIXER FOR AWHILE, BUT HAD TO WAIT TILL I FOUND A FANTASTIC BUY ON IT LIKE THE ONE AMAZON SENT ME IN AN E-MAIL. I COULDN'T WAIT ANY LONGER!!! THIS MIXER IS EVERYTHING I KNEW IT WOULD BE AND MORE. I LOVE THE WEIGHTINESS FOR GREAT STABILITY, NO MATTER WHAT I AM USING IT FOR. I GOT THE CINNAMON GLOSS COLOR, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!! IT IS AN ABSOLUTE DREAM TO OPERATE."
5,Great mixer at a great price,"Since my old mixer of over 25 years was tired, I purchased the KitchenAid at the terrific price of $249.00, which was $30 below any other price I researched at the time. This holiday has been busy with baking many tasty cookies, breads and cakes using the KitchenAid and I am most satisfied with the results. It is a much heavier mixer than my old one but the weight is a plus when you are mixing a heavy batter at high speeds. I gave this product a 5 star revue as it met my needs and my pocketbook."
2,Do you want a KitchenAid or a KitchenAid?,"The KitchenAid brand was created by Hobart who manufactured the equipment for years until selling out to Whirlpool in 1986. Like many of you, you are probably here because your folks had a KA mixer that lasted for 25 years and now its your turn. If you want the mixer your parents had, check out the Hobart N50 ... still made in Ohio I believe. Its expensive .. $1600 ..... but then so is replacing your KitchenAid every three years, if it lasts that long. Half the problem is that the manufacturing is not what it once was for KA, the other half is people not reading the manual properly ... either way a mixer in this day and age should be able to cope with heavy dough for more than four minutes on low speeds ....."
2,"Nice looking product, not very reliable","I am reviewing this product after two years of use. The product itself has been reviewed in detail here, and does not need to be repeated. It is a beautiful, heavy product. We used it perhaps 30 times for very light duty use when making cakes or muffins, and a few weeks ago started making a horrendous noise. After a few minutes of this noise, sparks literally flew out the back of the unit and it ceased working. I have tried to get it repaired, but was quoted almost a much as it originally cost me here on Amazon. At this point, I am not sure whether to get a new one, and use the first for spares, or cut my losses, and try to find something that will be more solidly designed. I believe that the components used to make this mixer are not of the same quality as those that have been made for years. For this reason, I cannot recommend the product. Too bad, as it is quite nice."
5,Everything I wanted,I have been wanting one of these mixers for years but my husband never got the hint. It is everything I wanted in a mixer and more. It easily handles the thick dough for bread or cookies. It is easy to switch beaters and the bowl is large enough to handle all my cooking needs.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"When using the mixer it is not possible to scrape the sides of the bowl while it is mixing so you have to stop it every so often to clean the sides. If you don't have the protector on the top and even sometimes when you do, it throws flour, etc., all over the place. It is too heavy.I prefer the old two beater type which the bowl rotates while mixing. I am disappointed in this product."
3,"Great mixer, until it leaks oil!","I got my mixer for a Christmas gift in 2007. It's a wonderful mixer, but since I don't use it often, I was shocked to find it leaked a large quantity of oil into the bowl while sitting there unused. There seems to be a lot of people complaining about this, if you go to KitchenAid's website. Oh, and now it won't turn on, either. Probably because the motor has no more oil in it. I guess I'll be using my handheld mixer from now on."
5,Love my new KitchenAid mixer!,"My husband purchased the KitchenAid KSM150 mixer for my Christmas present. He did a lot of research, and found this one to be rated very high. I love it! The first thing I made was German stollen, using the wire whip and the bread hook. It worked like a charm, saving me at least a half hour of kneading time. It's heavy, very powerful, and has all the features I need. Plus, it has the option of lots of attachments. (I'm thinking of getting the juicer.) The bowl is very deep (keeps splattering to minimum) and it locks into place. The whole thing fits neatly under the cabinet in the corner of my kitchen counter. After using a hand mixer for so many years, this is a real luxury!"
3,Mixer review,"This mixer is only okay. It has a VERY limited range of function. It's quite perfect if you're cooking for 12 and making 6 pounds of something. If you have a family of 3 or 4 and are making the typical dinner where you are whipping up something small, this thing is way beyond overkill. The bowl is too deep and the beaters don't reach the bottom, hence my statement that you need to make 6 pounds of something. I'm greatly unimpressed, this thing ought to be advertised as a restaurant tool where it belongs."
5,KitchenAid Mixer,"Best addition to my kitchen! I love this mixer so much, I use it for everything- dough, batter, meatballs, dips, etc. I love the color too!! Great product,"
3,Non-functional from time of purchase,"I recently purchased this model of mixer (in red) and was disappointed to find that the product was broken right out of the box. Specifically, the mixer makes a high-pitched squeal when in operation, even if none of the attachments are in place. Of course I cannot be sure whether the shipping process or the manufacturing is to blame, but if you are considering ordering a KitchenAid online for the discount, keep in mind the possibility that you will pay it back in wasted time and shipping fees."
5,"Great Mixer, well worth the money","I bought this thing awhile back, and use it more than I thought I would. Sometimes things get purchased, and after the newness wears off they become dust collectors. This isn't one of those things! The only thing I have had an issue with is the hinge pin that the head pivots on. The pin has shifted a bit a couple of times, and looked like it may pop out. It has never fallen out, but it's something I watch when it's being used. It hasn't become looser with use, and it's never shifted enough to effect function, so I'm still willing to give the mixer a 5 star rating. I can't imagine not having it in the kitchen."
3,Average,"I have always wanted one. They are such a beautiful piece of equipment. I decided upon the imperial gray, it is a great color that doesn't show fingerprints or smears because of the non-shiny finish. Amazon's service was great and very fast, as always. But my complaint is that my mixer was not mixing all the way on the sides and bottom so we adjusted the screw like recommended and it took care of the mixing on the bottom but it still doesn't mix the sides very well. I do not like that you cannot reach inside the bowl to scrape unless you lift the top and then you still have to reach around the beater. I preferred the Oster stand mixer that I had for years because it had a large, wide bowl that spun. You could scrape as it mixed. I wish I had gotten the Sunbeam Heritage instead which has the shallow, wide bowls, comes with 2 different sizes. I could have saved money too."
1,Attachment mechanism died within two years,"The attachment mechanism no longer runs, and there's no valid warranty. I bought the item thinking that they ""last for life."" They don't. The can opener never worked right."
5,Just What I Always Wanted!,"KitchenAid KSM150PSWH Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, WhiteI have wanted a KitchenAid mixer for over 45 years. I have used it twice since I received it and I'm amazed at how wonderful it is. I could have purchased it years earlier if I hadn't kept buying the less expensive hand mixers. Well worth the expense and I got it at an Amazon special sale that made the deal even better. I'm still smiling!"
2,NEW isn't necesarily better!,"Very disappointing Kitchen Aid. My old one (30+ yrs.) is still in excellent working order. But, someone talked me into buying this new one. The motor is noisy; there is no Speed 1....the mixer starts on Speed 2, which is annoying when you need a low/slow speed to incorporate ingredients. The instructions explain to not operate at higher speeds, so why are higher speeds supposedly available on the mixer? I noticed that when I tried to make bread, this mixer could not adjust to heavier dough. Instead, it grinds slower & slower. I did keep my 30 yr. old KitchenAid - ""Old Thunder"" which has worked beautifully. So, when this new 'throw away' finally dies, I'll still have my trusty old KitchenAid to use for breads, grinding, shredding & to 'let 'er rip at high speeds'!"
4,price rose while I was getting ready to order,Amazon raised the price $30 while I was picking the color - that stopped me cold - will not order now - merry xmas from amazon.
3,"OK mixer, but not great","I'll keep it short and sweet. The mixer looks good, and it works. It is very noisy and heavy. It can't beat egg yolks as well as my hand held mixer, so the eggnog was a bit thin this year. The beater just doesn't move fast enough and doesn't scrape the sides of the bowl at all. Also, I'm worried about the plastic/nylon/whatever gears. My old mixer worked until the brushes wore out, but it has a solid metal gearbox. Only time will tell about this one. I wish I had bought the Pro model (which has steel gears), but I was ignorant (ignorance is NOT bliss). Actually, I wish I had bought a mixer that used two standard type beaters and had metal gears."
2,Be ware - selling defected items!!!,"I jsut purchased this NEW kitchenAid, empire red, from amazon. It got in defected - with a 1.5cm scratch on the top of it. I asked for replacement, but the 2nd one arrived with a three times bigger crack around the same spot!Could it really be that Amazon sells defected kitchenAids? I hope not! I therefor give it another chance with an additional replacement and we'll see.KitchenAid KV25GOXER Professional 5 Plus 5-Quart Stand Mixer, Empire Red"
4,Love love it!,"I am so happy with my mixer. Having a great time whipping up treats. Item was well packaged and in excellent condition when received. The price was awesome!Only issue I had was with the rebate offer. I purchased the food grinder and completed the rebate form accurately, or so I thought. To my surprise I was shipped a second grinder. What on earth am I supposed to do with 2 grinders? Really?I contacted the Kitchen Aid rebate center and was told that I selected the grinder on the rebate form and there is nothing they could do. Pardon me, but my understanding of a rebate is I buy the item, send you my proof of purchase and you send me a check for what I paid. So it is my mistake to have purchased the grinder in the first place. I am happy to exchange the item for another attachment and pay the difference, but that doesn't seem to be an option. Buyer beware of how you complete rebate forms. I wish I had kept a copy."
4,Great Replica,"Great replica with great workmanship, and really good packaging. Very lightweight model. The model is a little smaller than I expected but it looks very nice. I think it is carved out of a light weight wood then painted."
3,Not bad at all for the price,"Knock on wood, it's been 5 months and this vacuum is still working. Unlike the last vacuum (a hoover windtunnel) that I paid $350 for, that only last a year until it blew out and would cost $250 to replace. Anyway, this vacuum is very light and sucks up very well in my opinion. We have a LOT of cat hair and it works great. This machine is a bit loud, but what vacuum isnt'? I had a kirby that was pretty loud and weighed about 10 times more than this one. This vacuum is well worth the money."
1,Too many mistakes!,"I had originally purchased this book to assist me with my new hobby of collecting Tolkien books. It seemed to me that the book was hastily researched and quickly assembled to capitalize on the momentum that the movie trilogy had provided. There seemed to be too little detail for the various books out there and way too many errors in their description. It is now in the possession of my 9-yr old son who enjoys thumbing through the pages and looking at the pictures (probably the best part of this book). If you want a book that will truly help you with collecting Tolkien books, I would suggest Wayne Hammond's ""JRR Tolkien, A Descriptive Bibliography"" published by Oak Knoll Press, 1993."
3,Very informative and eye-opening,I used this book as a research tool for a report on Prop.209 and compare it to Washington states's Initiative 200. It had everything I was looking for. A great book.
5,A beautiful escape!,"I heard this CD last weekend while lodging at a wildlife refuge here in Texas. It was some of the most beautiful music I've heard. I asked for its title and artist, and have since ordered a copy myself from Amazon.com. Let the music begin!"
4,overall pleased,"Overall I'm pleased with the tees but one of the main reasons I picked the multi-colored pack was for the lime green tees. However they were dark green, they'll work they're just not as fun a color."
1,Teenage fantasy,"When I read all the praise in the other rewievs on this page, I thought 'this must be a great book' and bought it, but it really disappointed me. This is a nice little fairytale and it could be good as a teenage or children's fantasy-book (after some editing in the romance parts), but the plot is too obvious, the characters are like two-dimensional beings, lacking any depth and I doubt the author really thought about how to fit her story into the historical background. None of her ""historical"" characters ever thought to consult the church in all their dealings with a condemned witch, what would have been unthinkable in those times. So the setting is just some kind of fantasy country, not medieval scotland - but of course, Scottish or Viking chiefs make the best of macho heroes in this kind of book..."
2,some swivel glide,"it doesn't even swivel well. you do have to adjust the setting for it to pick anything up, and even that is subject to change. sometimes it wouldn't clean up anything unless on bare floor, other times it had to be the highest pile. who knows. and let me tell you how hard to find the replacement hepa filter??!! i have yet to find them (there are two pieces). you can't even buy it from the manufacturer it seems, they direct you to the store, and not one of them has had this in stock. so, buy a different one, a newer model maybe and they will have replacement features. the only good thing about this is the incredibly long hose (it extends) though the ""lock"" feature is [bad], it unlocks constantly, it does reach 2 thirds of the way up my stairwell (though i wish i had just bought one of those stair hugger ones).i agree, don't get it."
3,mystery toy,It worked the first time and second time. But by the third time the water did not come out. I took it to the warranty service guy and it just needed a new washer where the water came ; this was an imposition on my time . Later I tried to use the upholstery hose and I could not tell if the water was coming out. Since there was no water in the recovery tank this indicated that the water was not coming out. It is difficult to know if the soap is coming out and how much is coming out. The carpets that were cleaned were actually well cleaned. This machine has used up alot of my time trying to figure out if it is working or not. I bought this machine for the purpose it was created- to clean the carpet and upholstery but it behaved like a mystery toy with all manner of tics and maladaptive behaviors.
5,Well worth the investment,"This carpet scrubber is worth alot more cash than what I have invested in it. I have used the $300.00 Hoovers, they cannot compare to the value and the job that the Dirt Devil does. Very happy so far."
1,Dirt Devil is not responsive to customer complaints.,"I bought the CE7900 two years ago. After using it just 4 times it refused to work and leaked out the solution and water. Since I am handy, I determined that the water supply port was broken. The web site did not show a part number so I called Dirt Devil's customer service and was told that they could not send me the part, I had to go to an authorized dealer. I went to the dealer they told me was the nearest to me and gave them a copy of my receipt and they promised to order the part. I never heard from them again.I will never buy a Dirt Devil again. It's performance was okay but it was difficult to clean. I know that parts were covered under a two year warranty but I was willing to even purchase it if they had it listed on the web site or by phone. The web site only allows you to purchase standard items like filters and customer service would not sell me the part."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I was really looking forward to getting this machine after reading all of the reviews! It was easy to put together,but it is so heavy you basically have to be a body builder to use it. It does a good job cleaning,but after a few days my carpets looked really matted up. I would recommend it,but only to someone who has the muscles to use it! My mom has a hoover steamvac and I could clean my whole house with ease using it! It took me about 3 hours to clean to rooms with this one! I think next time I'll go with a hoover!"
2,Hard Push,The carpet extractor is hard to push on thick carpet and the cleaning has become a drudge. the design lacks imagination; The machine should have a self propel lever to engage the rear wheels for easy operation similar to a self propel lawn mower.
3,Lacks data,"The book is organized nicely. The formatting and color in the reloading tables is pleasant to look at and use. The technical content is a bit thin at the beginning of the book. The lack of pressure data for each load is a big deficiency, as a result the data has much less value for me. I'm not sure I will actually use any load data from this book."
4,Reloading for beginners and pros.....,"I haven't finished reading the entire book, however, the portions I have read have been very informative, easy to understand and fit for the beginner as well as the pro. I bought this with no experience in reloading to help determine if it is something I want to do. Although I am still on the fence about delving into the world of reloading, I'm sure this book is going to help me make up my mind."
1,Dreaming of a better Police State,"Unfortunately, the force that moves the critical race theory is a yearning for protection from freedom. Protection from words, thoughts, looks, attitudes. It's not a struggle to change those attitudes, but to suppress them. Ultimately, it's a dream of a noble police state. The very thought is abhorrent and the authors should be ashamed."
5,Mother was happy!,"I ordered this for my mother and she was happy with it and enjoyed the poetry. If she is happy, I am happy."
2,Byron Light,"For a film dealing with a reputedly scandalous life, the BBC telepic about Lord Byron is curiously dull. Jonny Lee Miller in the title role provides no depth at all to the character. Whether this is a consequence of a poorly written script of the actor's limitations is hard to say - probably a combination of the two. The film provides no insight into Byron's inspiration. For example, the film opens with a short prologue in Greece, where he has spent the two years. He returns to England and voila - we have Childe Harold's Pilgrimmage. His liaisons with a number of women are mostly shown as individual disconnected scenes that don't fit particularly well together within the overall narrative (the exception being the portrayal of his affair with his half-sister). In short, the series fails to illuminate Byron as either poet or womanizer. So all that is left is the usual sumptuously shot (although often too dark), decorated, and costumed BBC period piece without any substance."
2,Eh...,"I was disappointed with this. I love Jonny Lee Miller and I LOOOOVVEE Byron but the wholes left in this portrayal were too hard to ignore. I would have liked to see more about his writing process. And, of course, his relationship with Shelley. Not terrible though, I thought the casting of Miller was perfect."
4,Ceramic Chicken Cooker,Great concept. Cooked a great chicken. This cooker allows you to get creative with the liquids you choose for the marinade.
2,Great chicken but the ceramic breaks,"I got one of these but it was cracked. They sent me another one. I liked it. Great chicken. Easy clean up. After using it several times I accidentally put it down on a wet counter and it cracked. So I gave up. But I missed it, so awhile later I ordered one. I used it twice, and was very careful not to shock it. It cracked anyway."
5,The BEST childrens music I have come across!,"This is an incredible CD of enthusiastic, fun, energetic childrens music that even the Mom's & Dad's find themselves singing to! We have thoroughly worn out our tape version over the last 4 years and have now purchased the CD to fit our new vehicles stereo system. I told the kids today we were getting DOLF again and they said ,"" Do you have it NOW!?"" I highly recommend this CD for families who like to sing together and have fun together. Thanks Dolf!"
5,Best since Dead Stars,"Love this single and the remixes. It is NOT as good as Dead Stars, but it is the first thing I have liked by Covenant since then.Not much of a tune, but the drums (patterns) are really cool. The single mix is good, but the album mix is even better. And ""Mix #5"" takes it in a new direction while still being good, always tricky with dance records that rely on a drum pattern for their hook. The song still holds up with a new pattern.Not a huge fan o fthe ""b sides"" but I guess that's why they are on the B side :-)Fans and dance fans who like their music to bit a little edgey need to pick this up now!"
3,Gift,"Was gift to my grandchild....didn't look like this picture. Round, colorful with Marbles, I think. Didn't hear any complaints, and they used it."
2,Smaller than expected,"My fault, but I thought the game would be much bigger. More like a standard chess board size. It's is about 2/3rds of that and the marbles and very cheap and plastic which makes them hard to play with especially on such a small board."
2,Topeak or not Topeak,I was surprised when I got this basket that the quick-release must be mounted on a Topeak brand rack. This certainly wasn't clear when I placed my order.I bought a budget rack and ended up attaching this basket with bungie cords. Not quite what I expected.
4,HOW CAN YOU LOSE,"I just purchased my second Dirt Devil Bagless in 2 years. I did review every single vacuum cleaner and still came back to this one. It is light weight, easy to use, easy to clean, and does a good job on my house full of hard wood floors. The price is right -- I got tired of buying expensive vacs for the last 45 years to have them die in 5 years. I have a 4 year old expensive Meile in my closet that I can't get fixed. For the price this is a winner. It also has no problem picking up the hair of one cat. In these economic times we all want to get our money's worth and I feel that this was one of the best household purchases I have made."
5,vaccuum,I generally make final decisions regarding a purchase of this type by reading reviews. They were accurate. Great little vaccuum for the money.
4,Very Satisfied,I have an old hardwood floor that has some large cracks where the boards no longer fit tightly together. I was looking for a cleaner with enough suction to clean these gaps. After doing some research on line this Dirt Devil sounded like what I was looking for. I have been very pleased with it. It has excellent suction and does a great job for what I bought it for. I don't use it on any areas except the hardwood floors so I can't really say how it performs on other surfaces. I just know that it works fine for me.
3,Needs improvement,"This product could use two improvements: the bayonet clips used to attach the carrying strap to the main body needs to be made out of metal. The current plastic clips will break as evidenced by mine. Second, an auto-cord rewinder would be nice."
2,Not worth it if you have pets or carpet,We were hoping to find something that could handle the hair from our two large dogs. Though it did well with our hardwood and tile as far as picking up dirt I constantly had to stop and pull the hair off the end of the nozzle. This vacuum was useless on the throw rug in our living room as well. The hose is a cheap plastic and the heads are not very sturdy. We read hundreds of reviews and was hoping that this vacuum would take care of things but we are very disappointed. We are returning.
4,good vacuum,only have used a couple of times so far but am very pleased with the performance of the the vacuum . The weight is great for my back and so easy to use on hard wood as well as carpet. Great value for the price!
2,"just ""OK"" not great","Purchased because I wanted a bagless vacuum and something fairly light to carry around a small house and get under furniture. My very good old bagless Sanyo I got for $5 at a yard sale bit the dust when the kitties crashed a piece of furniture onto it (my fault, of course, really). This is pretty good at cleaning but the floor attachment's brush strip grabs the cat hair bunnies and clogs the head rather than sucking it up like the Sanyo did. I may remove the brush strip. Rug attachment likes to keep the cat hair even more, rather than sending it on its way. The most annoying thing is how extremely high-pitched and noisy the motor is. Bottom line is it does the job, with a little nozzle cleaning now and then, so I suppose I will live with it."
2,Dirt Devil,"The Dirt Devil is a small and light vacuum, but the suction power that was promised is not what I'd expected. The floor tools are not nice to work with, they are hard plastic and don't seem to work properly. All in all a bit of a disappointment. I guess I had to go for a more expensive one."
4,Nice little vacuum for the money,"The low price and good reviews are what lead me to buy this vacuum. It is lightweight, does a good job on hard floors. The suction for carpets doesn't seem that great - it does not pick up any lint on my area rugs. If you have mostly hard flooring, then this is a good pick. Would not recommend for carpets though."
4,Wierdest of the Wierd,"Hilarious, and true. I wish this would happen today, so I could see it up close. Some of the film quality was grainy, but it was also of film clips that are 60 years old. Funny comic book style."
3,where are the names of the songs,"I had this lp vinyl early in my days plus many others earlier recordings by jimi hendrix. I had one album that no one seems to have had though. it contained the hit by the animals called the house of the rising sun, only jimi did it. it is sad that amazon.com does not have this one album w/this track jimi composed. what an excellent remake he didon the house of the rising sun. if you can find this album (or maybe in cd format), please e-mail me. sincerely and thankyou."
2,save yourself some money,"I don't want to mislead anyone I love ""the camera"" but save yourself a lot of money and but just the camera. the name ""starter kit"" is very misleading! there is no film, no batteries but it comes with a very useless poster. again just buy the Lomographic Holga camera, go to YouTube type in Holga camera and have fun. JUST DON'T BUY THE STARTER KIT."
3,Misleading,"This package is actually quite nice. There is one thing that I must disagree with however. It DOES NOT include film or batteries, as the pictures and description suggest."
2,happy yet disappointed,"The Lomographic Starter Kit was mailed to me on time, but I did not receive batteries, the canister of film, or the box that says Holga by Lomography. I was happy when my package arrived, but now I'm disappointed. If you have the other items, I would appreciate them being sent to me. Thank you."
2,Where's everything pictured??!,"I love the camera but it DOES NOT COME WITH FILM OR BATTERIES!!! So, I was headed out a trip and couldn't use the camera. Super disappointed with that. I didn't need to pay [$..] bucks for the camera and some books. :(Just buy the camera and film separately..."
3,Holga Camera Review,Since we are still trying to figure out just how to use the camera it is hard to give it an accurate rating. So far my son is enjoying it but the first bunch of pictures he took didn't come out that well. He needs to read a bit more on the details. He is enjoying the camera and I think it was worth the money.
2,No film or batteries included,"I was excited to bring this camera on vacation and paid extra for 2-day shipping. To my dismay, film and batteries were NOT in the box. This film is hard to find in my area so I won't be able to use my camera on vacation. The description and picture are deceptive. I am frustrated with this purchase."
3,Excited but also a little disappointed,"For a few years I have wanted one of these camera's and in May I decided that I was going to get one. After doing some research I decided that I will pay a little more and get the starter kit. At least it will come with film that I can test run the camera.Well, I was excited and surprised to receive my package today after only ordering a few days ago.When I opened it I noticed that it did not come with the promised film and batteried and that disappointed me since I wanted to start using it right away. Now I wish I would have just gotten the camera.Anyway, that is not going to stop me from enjoying my new toy and I look forward to using it."
1,"I hate to give this box set 1 star, BUT...","I waited ten years to get this box set. Prices range from $50.00 to $200.00! So when a new set was available for $45.00 I grabbed it. When I watched the first disc I was greatly disappointed. A & E usually puts out quaility material, but this set is horrible. It appears that 16mm Low fade prints from the 1980's were used, and the contrast is grainy at best. some titles are missing the opening title, and have scratches and splices abound. I know that 35mm elements are available, so why use 16mm prints that have had television service? I do not beleive that a restored set is in the works, unless Shout Factory has plans to release it. I was disappointed, but I still love the series."
3,Tanto del cheapo,"I keep looking for reasons to give this cheap knife two stars, because it's below average. But it works. It's not very sharp, and it's manufactured to poor tolerances, so that there's a tiny bit of play in the blade when it's locked open, and it's not much to look at. Seems like it'd be hard to sharpen, and the thumb stud is right-hand only. On the other hand, it'll cut up boxes just about as good as a $50 Spyderco, and you won't cry when you drop it down a storm drain. As a last-ditch weapon, it'll work-- just try it out on a raw pork shoulder if you don't believe me-- and you won't mind leaving it in the body and walking away. Just kidding. I hope.This is the kind of knife I like to keep around to give to people who don't have knives, or to throw in a drawer or toolbox. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could-- a passing grade, worth the money (since it's practically free), but below average."
4,What we needed!,"We recently moved to San Diego and it has been HOT this summer! With no A/C, we have tried everything from multiple fans to s dehumidifier to try and stay cool enough to sleep at night. This fan finally did the trick! It keeps the miserable hot upstairs down to a tolerable warm during the day and at night when it's cool outside it works wonders so that you can sleep. I recommend measuring your window first, we had to rig it to fit in ours. This is not meant to cool an entire house, but it will make a noticable difference in the room that it is in. Shipped super fast as well."
1,Poor construction,I ordered this product because it would fit in my basement window. Both fan blades rattled against the grills as soon as it was turned on. I returned the fan to Amazon for an exchange. The second fan arrived and its fan blades also rattled against the grill. I'm returning the second one for a refund and would not buy from this manufacturer again.
1,not what I expected,"did not pull much air out of a hot computer room, 12 x 10 foot room. I guess it worked ok."
5,Great Pictures!,"If you are a fan of Chinese history or art, this is the book for you. I enjoyed this book because of the magnificent pictures, and ancient Chinese paintings depicted in it. Not only are the pictures interesting, but so is the text. It tells of......I guess you'll have to see for yourself! Great buy, all though I was afraid at first that I payed too much, after I recieved it those fears were put to rest."
3,Good Movie for Kidz,"well since i stared in this movie (10 years ago) i can't really say that it's bad, but it's also not fenomenal, it's just an average movie suitable for kidz aged bet. 7-12 yr old. there were more scenes in this movie that for some reason haven't been included in this final version, and i really don't know why...since it took us whole days to shoot, but oh well.....bottom line is for its price the movie is better than most, even better than some highly publicized hollywood movies."
3,Lines,"I ordered this tie because it looked to have a stylish, plain pattern. However, upon receipt I found striped ticking in the fabric that, at lease in my opinion, detracts from the appearance of the tie. This ticking is not apparent at all in the view of the tie in its picture."
1,No tab... so if you don't read music on guitar don't buy it...,I was very dissapointed to see it's only staff music... although I read music I don't read it and play it on guitar....so if you don't read you wont get much out of it...Should say that on the cover if you ask me....
3,Disa[ppointing,"Nurturing Traditions is so well researched, brilliant and well done, that I looked forward to the same quality of work here. I'm just not getting this. But perhaps I have not had the same type of introduction as I had to the cookbook."
2,Not easy to read,I was not as pleased with this book. I was hoping it would be more organized. The reading became very dull after chapter 2.
5,The Fourfold Path to Healing,"This book is highly recommended by Sally Fallon of the Weston Price Foundation. It is excellent for Nutrition and natural ways of healing, etc. This along with Tropical Traditions by Sally Fallon are the basics of sound, good nutrition."
5,I don't know why i waited so long...,This is the best on the go potty i have tried. I have had it for about a week. The first time i used it with my daughter (22 months) we went to a outdoor festival. When we got back to the van i pulled it out. She sat right on it and went potty! It was so easy and those liners are amazing. They are really absorbent! I would recommend this product to anyone! My parents couldn't believe how great it worked. They said our generation has it easy raising kids! They didn't have things like that when they were raising us... =-)
4,"If you need it once, it pays for itself!","Went to a lecture on potty training, & the instructor said she would never be without this. I ordered 3-for me & each of my daughter-in-laws. Our 3 1/2 yr. old grandson ""tried it out"" to see how it worked. It certainly serves the purpose. It's portable. Just keep a travel size ""Lysol"" spray in the bag with it, to sanitize it after each use, between thorough cleanings. We are keeping ours in our van for emergencies. Instructor said the inserts are expensive, so use any plastic bags that will fit and can put papertowel in the bottom of the plastic bag for absorption....more economical. I would buy it again!"
4,small but great!,"The potty does have a pretty small seat, but it's big enough for my daughter to sit on and is very sturdy when the legs are clicked in properly. The small size makes it great for carrying around with you. It does sit a little low to the ground, so I usually sit it up on something so it feels more like a real potty (and as always, I supervise her while she's on it). We used it on a camping trip and have had to use it on a car trip as well. She used it with no problems."
4,Great to have on hand,We bought this for a trip to the beach and it was a lifesaver. Our daughter has only been using the potty for about three weeks and she had no problems using this potty. We used plastic grocery bags with an absorbant liner rather than replacement liners and they really worked much better (hence the four stars rather than five).
5,Strawberry DVD,"I loved Strawberry growing up and my daughters love her now. This movie is exactly as expected and true to Strawberry form: no violence, no conflict and no worries. My kids watch it over and over and over ..."
1,Buy only if you can't wait for an official release,"I was appalled that these 1960's TV cuts were released to DVD. When I bought this set, I was hoping for the original Columbia releases but no such luck. I suppose these are better than nothing, but barely. When (or if) Columbia puts out an offical release of these great films, I will promptly throw this set in the garbage where it belongs. Why these films were butchered in the first place remains a 40 year old mystery to me. And that opening theme song they came up with is like listening to fingernails on a blackboard! Very disapointing!"
1,teambuilding - not,I am not the least satisfied with this book. I think the exercises in it are lame. I was hoping for several ideas to perform in the office over the next 12-18 months but honestly I cannot find ONE worthy of trying! I'm sorry to say that this book is a complete waste of money and time.
2,Bleak scenario??,"Consider the following quote from a note (page 878) to the parable of the rich man and Lazarus:""Jesus gave us a rare glimpse of life in hell in this parable...if you have ever been badly burned, then you have an idea of the torment that awaits those who will spend eternity in hell. Add to that darkness and isolation, and you have an incredibly bleak scenario."" The guidance notes, far from being scholarly illuminations of various opinions, are completely weighed down by Greg Laurie's revival tent theology, and should by no means be taken as THE universal interpretation. Not so bad as a lot of stuff in this vein, but be sure to compare and contrast a few more scholarly study bibles, such as the Harper_Collins, before buying it hook line and sinker."
5,Explains How We Get To Be Men And Women,"In this book, Moore clarifies how we make the transition from child to adult, helping you see how this doesn't happen as efficiently in our society as it did when this transition was a ""life or death"" matter for the community. However, the lesson here is (more broadly) about personal transformational change. If you want to really change your life - making your actions in the world more aligned to your values - this describes the process, and the challenges therein.Moore's prior works (read ""King Warrior Magician Lover"") explains the basics of the human personality. To better understand how you got there (growing out of childhood), read this. His ""Facing The Dragon"" talks about how the unpleasant side of the human personality, and the often-untapped power inside each of us.Highly recommended!"
4,In Recycling,"Well this is a must have , book by all the liberies , becausethe usefulnes of its contents, I've read older editions andfound them very interesting for the development of communities"
4,Hawaii Five-O - The Fourth Season - Great Shows!,Anyone who is a Hawaii Five-0 fan will love this fourth season collection. Restoration has resulted in excellent picture quality throughout! The more I watch the more I realize this series was outstanding due to excellent story lines and the fact that all shows were filmed entirely on location in Hawaii. Everytime I see each episode I see new things in the background that are familiar from my visits to Oahu. Keep them coming Paramount!! Tom R
5,Hawaii Five-O,"So, who would not enjoy the fun of Steve McGarret catching the bad guys, and the Hawaiian Islands? Campy? Yah... But I love it just the same! I was a fan then, and I am a fan now! :-)."
5,Japonaiserie,"Strange, haunting and memorable. A work of the imagination that you will never forget. Based on tales by Lafcadio Hearne,the separate stories are visually compelling and dramatically striking.People who enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will find some of the same magic here."
4,Nightmares Will Come,"KWAIDAN is in some ways reminscent of the Twilight Zone movie made back in the 1980s. Like that film, it is comprised of four supernatural set pieces, and also like the Zone, the first of the pieces is the weakest.KWAIDAN's quiet stories all take place in medieval Japan, and they can give you the ""willies."" Viewers willing to watch the last three tales will not be disappointed; each story has gorgeous sets and surreal imagery. Some of the scenes will bounce around in your dreams for nights to come.I had just about forgotten the spooky Japanese girl of RINGU and then I had to watch the Snow Goddess of Kwaidan's second story give the protagonist her intense ""you're gonna die"" look, and now my sleep is troubled again."
4,Visually Stunning Ghost Stories,"Fans of the supernatural, ghost stories and students of the intricacies of Japanese culture will find much to savor in these richly spooky tales. Romance, revenge and even tattoos all play roles in shocking fables which you won't soon forget.Unlike most Criterion DVDs, there are no extras to speak of, save a thin booklet, but as usual the print quality is excellent and sound more than serviceable. The production values and complex sets must be seen to be believed and at times one feels as if they've entered into a large theatre where a stage show is being played out. However, don't think for a minute that this stage feel is ever confining. The compelling stories and complex execution allows the viewer to soar freely into chilling lands of wonderment and horror.Expect the unexpected and treat yourself to one of the most original and memorable film thrillers ever created.Criterion, please re-release this with worthy extras!"
4,"Handy to have, but over-priced","Great little key, easy to carry, made of material like what you'd see in a dog'd nsme tag. It seems sturdy enough, but is so small and lightweight that it only cost 45 cents for a First Class postage on a standard envelope - so why are the shipping costs so high? Especially disappointing was that there was no discount on shipping for buying more keys in the same order."
5,An Angel For May,"My wife and I are a couple of ""big kids"" and we loved it. Being British we love films of that era whether they be childrens films or otherwise. It brings back memories. Thank you.Simon Wainwright"
5,Very excited,"To recap the other review, I also had this ballet tote 23 years ago and I absolutely loved it and that was one of my fondest memories of being a dancer. I am completely overwhelmed that I have found this. I have been searching for these bags for years, thank you so much AMAZON.COM."
5,I can't believe this is still being made!!!,"I am about to turn 40, and I had this ""ballet box"" at around age 7. I remember I wanted it so badly & was sooooo excited when I got it! I can't wait to give it to my 7-year-old stepdaughter who really wants to learn how to dance, and will also be getting tap & ballet shoes, and a leotard and skirt to dance in!!!!"
5,Exceptionally superb!,"As I have stated elsewhere, I was weaned on fantasy fiction. So it comes as no surprise that I can say I was thoroughly impressed by this outing.hen it comes to fantasy fiction, I feel that it is the hardest genre to write because in trying to capture the ""fantasy"", you must keep to a strict collusion of what you consider 'facts"". Tyrone has done this in a superb way that challenges the masters of this genre, and shows that he is here to stay!"
5,A Terrific Story,"""Ledgend's Prophecy"" is a terrific story, filled with alot of action, suspense, and adventure. Author Tyrone Godfrey has captured the essence of ""real fantasy,"" with his array of wizards and magic. I recommend this truly wonderful book."
5,Simply Great!,"I've writen a review on this book on another web site, and I have to tell you, this book is ""Simply Great!"" I enjoyed it so much, that i'm wondering and waiting for the Author to release another. I highly recommend this title."
4,Balanced View of Episcopal Social Activism,"Rev. Lewis provides a balanced and provocative look at the history of social activism by the Anglican and Espicopal Church, starting with the Biblical foundations, rolling through the Reformation, and discussing slavery, economic activism, race relations, liberation theology, the role of women and the current controversies revolving around sexual orientation in the Church. His candid call for activism in the Christian tradition as well as the balance of calling out failures of the Episcopal Church in the past to deal with the social controversies of the past provides for a compelling read and a soul search as to what role we have to play as a Christian in light of tradition, scripture and reason."
2,could be great,"It's the right idea, but does not always work (sometimes I have to remove the cover and only then it starts working). It also doesn't come with a power supply (which is needed with some computers)."
5,"Great Book, The Alien by Victor Besaw!","Victor Besaw DID NOT write ""Alien""! He wrote an excellent story of a youth--""Godranac"" growing up as a slave, trying to find out who he is, and where he belongs. Very good reading!"
4,Great but had to modify slightly,"This item works well in my Toyota Tundra with my XM MyFi. However, I did have to file down the little piece that slides into the MyFi mounting bracket. Now it fits perfectly. The suction cup has held for more than 2 months, even in the hot Arizona sun."
4,GPS/other windshield pedestal,"I was having some trouble with vent mount holders for my gps setup using my cell phone as the gps. The plastic part on the holder that slides onto the pda mount that holds the phone had sheered off twice, so I was looking for another way. This long pedestal seems to work for me because this can use the dashboard for support so it is not just hanging in space and putting stress on the plastic part from bumps and the normal movements of the car. The pedestal is long enough that you can mount it down low to use the dash for support even on cars with very deep dashboards."
5,Good intro to Dreamweaver,"An excellent introduction to Dreamweaver, especially good as a quick review for web designer/developers moving into the world of CSS positioning. The PeachPit Visual Quickstart Guide format is excellent for learning quick bites of info (1-3 pages per concept), clearly illustrated. This format also allows the reader to return to source material quickly for review."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this keyboard after killing my Apple Keyboard by spilling coffee in it. I needed a keyboard desperately and pulled into a CompUSA going out of business. The keyboard appealed to me with the wireless capability and the Mac compatible design. I'm experiencing batteries that die quickly, a hub that doesn't light up to indicate low battery warning, missed keystrokes, keystroke lag, keys that are starting to fade after only 2 months, an eject key that opens and closes the CD carriage simultaneously, no support response from Kensington after two emails, and compared to Apple's designs--a rather gaudy design when you really look at it. It looks more like a white Windows XP design by it's standards (very subjective comment there). I don't use the mouse as I already have a Logitec MX Laser. I should have given it a 1 star rating but I am still using it until I buy a new Apple keyboard, and it is functional. Avoid this keyboard!"
2,Dropping keystrokes,"I bought this in the hope of getting all the multimedia and browser buttons of a Microsoft keyboard but the correct key labels and layout for my Mac. Having switched from a MS keyboard, however, I'm now regretting it. The Kensington pilot board seems to have significant difficulties transmitting wirelessly, as it regularly drops keystrokes and often shows a perceptible lag between key hit and computer response (compared to a wired keyboard). I'm returning mine."
3,"Good keyboard, bad mouse...","We are using this product with a new iMac G5. The keyboard works well and has nice functionality in the form of all the custom buttons. Keep in mind the board along with the hand-rest take quite a significant chunk of space on the desktop - significantly more than the minimal Apple keyboard. The mouse looks and feels great and is designed very ergonomically. It's one major fault is that its wireless trait make the cursor (little arrow) very jittery and I couldn't quite find a good compromise. It is adjustable and there are different settings, but compared with a standard wired-mouse, it is very difficult to get the cursor point exactly where you want it, particularly in slow speeds. This one thing damages the whole experience with the product and should be considered when purchasing it.Also, after about 3 weeks (of rather minimal use), the batteries of the keyboard already need to be replaced!"
1,This disk contains Sony's rootkit,Don't buy this disk if you plan on playing it on your computer. It contains Sony's spyware-enabling rootkit which can kill your computer.Amazon should note these disks prominently so that people don't unknowingly fall prey to such scummy tactics.I am returning this disk to Amazon.
1,Your first clue....,"....to how bad this book is is the fact the author had to pay someone to publish it. Obviously undeterred by what must have been the countless rejection letters she received from actual publishers (you know, the kind that pay authors for rights to readable material), she forged ahead with her 414 page magnum opus and readers everywhere are now the unfortunate victims of her unmitigated hubris. Some self-published tomes actually turn out to be worthwhile niche books--the proper niche for this one is the ""round file."""
