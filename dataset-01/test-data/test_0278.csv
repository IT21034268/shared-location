4,Rising storm,"It was good I mean great but that cliffhanger in the end,I literally said""what""! ""Tigerclaw was the new leader of thunderstorm""! I mean I have to wait till morning(I read at night) to get the next book!"
2,Not same as pictured,What is pictured is not the same as the item. Pictured urinal is similar to others I've used and they are more sturdier. The ones they sent are a bit flimsy. The current price is showing $8.99. Do not buy it at that price. I got them for a bucks a piece so... Get what you pay for.
4,"Fine line between so,so and so good","On first hearing I was very disapointed, I expected something monumental from Sir Paul, however after hearing the song for 2wks its grown on me. I do like it and it sticks out like a sore thumb in today's highly overated clone induced, sample bled, un-original tunes that are over produced today. Even though it does'nt fit into today's market, Ex Beatle Paul(in his 60s) is having a blast maybe thats a good thing or maybe thats bad..Its a Fine Line! I'm certain it will make the top 20 in the UK. In the US it might do better. At least McCartney is doing his thing trying to create new material without losing his identity as an artist, he remains a bonofide original! I recommend all music lovers to purchase this and the album."
5,A song worthy of Pauls beatle songs!!!,"Congrats Sir Paul! Fine Line is a beautiful song. Great and Fantastic. My kids and i play it over and over and over again. In the car going to school, to the mall and before they sleep! You know if Paul composed and sang this song in his Beatle years, im 100% sure it will hit #1 in the billboard charts. If he wrote it in the 70s it will be another #1 single for Wings. Even though it didnt hit the charts in 2005, to us fans with taste and intelligence, Fine Line is #1 !!!"
2,Best song from a weak lot,"Chaos and Creation ranks at the bottom of the albums released from McCartney. ""Fine Line"" ends up being the best song from a woeful bunch of tunes cobbled together for McCartney's Chaos CD. But is it a good song? Lets put it his way; it's a nice song. So nice that it's part of a car commercial these days. On any other McCartney album it would have been a filler track. It would be nice if Paul could re-acclimate himself to the electric guitar and do a little rock 'n' roll again."
1,Too simple,"Very bad book, everything it says is intuitive. I dont recomend it if you have just a little experience interviewing people."
5,Excellent general reference,"Lake and Pond Management by Steve McComas is an excellent reference for cooperative extension advisors, soil and water conservation district staff, lake association representatives, and other watershed managers. Licensed commercial pesticide applicators who are considering broadening their credentials to the aquatic pest control category would also find this Guidebook a valuable addition to their reference libraries. As a retired university farm advisor and riverfront landowner, I found this book highly educational - and well worth the price.Steve SutterPresque Isle, Maine"
1,Inadequate info,"I was looking for software that I could install to 'read' scanned documents... something like OCR software. This one came up in my search, but didn't say in the information that it was ONLY if you had the DigiMemo hardware, so I purchased it. I had to open the packaging to get to the instructions, so now I spent money that was a waste because I can't send it back since it won't do what I expected."
5,Superb,"Big Mon is an excellent collection of Bill Monroe covers. Personally, my favorites are Cry, Cry Darlin' by Dolly Parton and Walk Softly by the Dixie Chicks. Dolly Parton and Natalie Maines have the perfect voices for Monroe's music and it is a beautiful fit."
4,Exiles = Excellent!,"Melanie Rawn has never failed to awe me! This book was a bit confusing, with geneology and everything, but in all, it took me to a world that I could hold onto in my mind and picture everything as it happened. I cried, laughed, raged and embraced."
5,I would give it 10 stars if I could!,"This book was absolutely incredible. I was completely wrapped up in it halfway through the first paragraph! Although this book was quite long I read it in four days... I couldn't put it down! I would also like to point out to whoever wrote the Kirkus Review that they should watch their spelling: Liwellan and Feiran are the correct spellings. I couldn't believe how harshly ""Exiles"" was reviewed by Kirkus; the book was a fantastic read and I have re-read it at least fifteen times. I recommend it to anyone!"
4,"Starts out really slow, but the effort is worh it.","When I first starting reading this book, after the Dragon Prince novels, I was extreemley disapointed.The book would spend as many as 100 pages on one character, and then suddenly jump to another. This is especially difficult when your reading a section on a boring character, and all you want to do is get it over with and see whats happening with your favorite character.However, after about mid-way through it slips into the Dragon Prince method where you'd constantly jump between characters, and never spending too much time on a single group.All in all, it is a very good book, and fans of the Dragon Prince series or of Melanie Rawn shouldn't hesistate to check it out."
4,Good,Good Show. The picture itself is low grade but it is a good show over all. Very Good show overall.
4,Prince Charming Ain't Coming to the Rescue,"This book combines thoughtful insight into the emotional, behavorial and psychological reasons many women get into deep debt and fail to plan financially for retirement. There is no doubt that both men and women get into deep debt. Dowling suggests that women are more prone to lose control of their financial well-being because of gender scripting we get from a very early age. The challenge of the book is to see through this gender scripting, decide how it may be affecting your financial decisions and then take charge of your financial life. I loved it!"
3,Comedy from poverty row,"This is a Monogram Studio film from 1942, a strictly second feature lasting 62 minutes. It's mildly amusing; on the level of a Bowery Boys film from the same studio. Zasu Pitts, all of 44 years old, is the ""old lady,"" Aunt Emma, and she plays the part well. This is a 2 1/2 on a scale of one to four: competent and watchable, but wholly forgettable. Douglas Fowley is in the film, one of his hundreds of ""B"" level movies."
5,Lost Episodes?,"Where Maggie thinks the dog is her dead boyfriend, it's called Animals R Us (3.4). Check this out for all the episodes: http://home.comcast.net/~mcnotes/34.html"
5,Best book ever,This book blew me away! It could not stop reading it! Great book! Read it you will not regret it!
2,Broken but good,"Recieved package on time. Not packed well, one broken. Call and recieved another order but same thing broken jar because of bad packing. If you don't mind picking through the glass, the cashews are good."
3,Good for the price you pay,I have only used this trailer a few days and so far it is working great. I think that this is a good trailer for those who are not hardcore cyclists. I am mostly using it around the neighborhood and only as a bike trailer (I don't plan to use it as a stroller) and it is running smoothly and it isn't heavy to pull.
3,A Delightful Recording,"Since buying this a week or so ago, it has rarely left my CD player, and is equally pleasurable at the start or end of the day. The performances are energetic and moving, and make me long for my former days with a cathedral choir, when #16 was one of our favorites. With each hearing, I find more to delight me. (While I agree that the diction is good enough that lyrics on the liner notes aren't strictly necessary, they would have been a nice addition.)"
3,Absurd and funny but lacking focus,"It's easy to imagine Homer Simpson cast as Schwartzwelder's bumbling hero Frank Burly. But what the author is trying to accomplish here is more than just a novel-length Simpsons episode. The result is often funny but lacking a solid focus. Burly changes his mind and purpose whenever it suits the joke, and he's an impossibly bad detective. ""Sometimes my clients have to explain their problems to me more than once. I don't charge them for that. It's part of the service, I figure. If the case is really complicated, I might ask a smarter detective, or the guy who runs the elevator, to sit in and simplify the whole thing for me.""The story does have a point, however, and somewhere along the way you'll recognize loose ends being tied up, but it's all so silly and absurd that it seems to be trying too hard."
5,Once and Again,Watched most of the episodes when they first aired. Very much enjoyed watching them the second time around.
5,Outstanding Series about Relationships,"This is an outstanding story about the real issues of life. You will enjoy this production if you enjoy thinking about the strange and powerful paths of our different relationships throughout one's lifetime. The performances of ALL of the actors are excellent. The script is thoughtful, intelligent, powerful and mesmerizing. The topic is relevant. What else can one ask for? I cannot wait for the second season to be released! It is a shame that ABC does not have the sense to address reality in their current productions (I know it is called 'reality' television but it is all escapism). 'Once and Again' makes one ponder the small things that really counts."
4,should be required reading,"this book is good common sense, and should be one of the first things anyone new to wicca reads."
4,Real glam rock,"The first thing that attracted me to this album was the song ""funtime"". Already being a Bowie and Iggy pop fan, I popped in the disk was overpowered by how intense and in your face the cd is. This is Boy George at his most honest and his best. It never got the attention that it deserved and should be re released to those who have not had the opportunity to listen to this. Trust me, you'll forget that CC ever existed!!"
5,Baraby Skye Series,This is an exciting book about the early West. I could hardly put it down. I plan to order other books in the series.
5,Hoover windtunnel,"its run hard and worked well for a VERY long time. I bought it about 5 years ago based on the current consumer reports score being the 3rd highest. it may not be a kirby or a rainbow, but it WORKS, and thats what matters to me. it works best if you empty the canister regularly and blow out the air filter with a shop vac, that really cleans things up and suction is strongest. but it works fine even if you don't blow out the air filter."
4,Great for small personal office,"A very good printer that takes little space. At $49 I thought it was good way to get started in color printing, since I'd been using a B&W lasterjet for so many years. My husband is so impressed that he told me I could upgrade to another printer and he's take the HP 3745 for his own office. I was able to buy the USB cable at the store I bought the printer."
1,COMPLETE JUNK!!!!! DO NOT BUY !!!!!!,"This seemed like a reasonable buy for simple printing projects.The first problem was that my HP computer had trouble recognizing the software. Once I sorted through that problem, when it came time to print the test page, the paper jammed. After 10 attempts and 10 paper jams, I returned, exchanged, thinking I received a defective one, and the next printer did the same thing. I recommend NOT wasting your time and money on this low quality, cheaply made piece of junk."
4,Smitten,"This was a quirky romance story and a fast read. The story involves a single mother of two becoming a construction worker, she falls in love with her boss, a crazy aunt, a dog who eats everything (I have one of those), and throw in a neighborhood flasher. If you are looking for a funny fast read, then this is one for you."
3,"Potato chips -- suddenly the bag is empty, but you don't feel any fuller","Barely plotted and the characters barely written, this story is just as light as air and harmless and pleasant to read. It is fun to preview all of the Plum elements, especially Aunt Elsie (early Grandma Mazur) and the inevitable Cadillac. Of course the characters sleep together, but, interestingly, pretend to be married to avoid a neighborhood scandal. Wow -- did people really used to expect people to be MARRIED to have sex? Surely not! That's practically intolerant!Don't seek this book out, but it's not annoying, and will let you follow through with your committment to lights out at 10:30.I rate books as follows:***** Fun and meaningful book, or changed/challenged me in a positive way.****Really fun or meaningful; well worth the time.***Pleasantly skimmed the surface; not memorable.**Plodded through.*Abandoned; very flawed."
5,Predictible but Enjoyable,"I read this book in one sitting. It was just what I was looking for, laying poolside, for a quick and entertaining read. Even though this book was soooo predictible, I mean, you know how the book is going to end by the end of the first chapter...but did it matter? Nope, I still enjoyed this light-hearted read. I laughed out loud and even got teary-eyed a bit. I would even read it again sometime."
4,Another relationship book,Fun read as most of her books are. She describes people well. The women seem real. Enough said enough said
3,Fun read,Satisfying ending with pleasant characters. Good with tea and cookies after dealing with the real world of frustrating people and not so perfect events all day!
3,"Three Brides, NO Groom","Not up to Debbie Macomber's style. Found it drawn out and very tedious. I've loved her style of writing for years but, am sorry this one just didn't do it for me."
3,One of the 2 MacOmber books I didn't like....,".... and I've read over forty. She's usually lovely but this was well... incomplete feeling. I never felt sweetly enveloped in any of the stories, which is something D Macomber usually does very well."
4,Joyous read,"I enjoyed this bood very much. The collection of bad/good girls and bad/good boys made for a delightful read.The book illustrated that noone has an easy time, but for once, in this book, all the good kids won.It was especially meaningful to me because I just passed a huge graduation milestone and reconnected with many friends, and we had all taken different paths than I expected."
1,I WANT A SAMPLE OF OXFORD TOWN!!!,"I'm not into david bowie, but one of the reviews from the starship trooper page said that the song from the graduation is called ""I have not been to oxford town"" by dave bowie. Why didnt they release that song? Ditto with the songs from replacement killers!!!"
3,Why did he left out the extra song?,"I bought this CD when it first came out. Not this enhanced version. Loved 80% of it. Would love 100% like I do for all his music. But 2 songs seem to be just fillers: ""I Am With Name"" and ""Wishful Beginnings"". It would have been more likelable if he took those out and kept ""Get Real"" Not sure if I would buy the CD again just for one more song?"
5,A Masterpiece,"Outside is one of Bowie's most engaging and satisfying works. The sound is impenetrably dense. The best way to describe it is jazz meets industrial.The ""storyline"" is ambiguous, which allows (or demands) for each listener to superimpose their own meanings onto the proceedings. The experience becomes interactive, unlike listening to writers that like to tell you exactly how they're feeling and what their songs are about.Ultimately, I don't think the ""storyline"" is the point of this album. I think it's about situations, textures, atmospheres, moments."
1,The worst Anime ever!!!!!!!!,"I think this movie was simply terrible. It had pretty bad animation, retarded voice acting, and the downright worst storyline in the world. I made the huge mistake of buying this movie before I rented it. You should honestly be feeling sorry for me. But hey you can't blame me, it looks cool on the box(sniffle). The altime worst moment in anime history is right here in this movie. But I won't spoil it for you. But it will make you laugh(because it's so stupid), and cry(because you have to watch it) at the same time."
1,Possibly the worst anime I've ever seen,"When I ordered Berserk, which is a spectacular anime, volumes five and six I recieved a demo disc along with them. On the disc were single episodes from five different animes. One of them was Genma Wars. This is quite possibly the worst anime I have ever seen. I'll admit that I've only seen one episode of the series and in most cases it's hard to make an accurate judgement based on that, but Genma Wars is in a completely awful class of it's own. The animation is terrible, the plot is so convoluted you'd think a three year old wrote it and the acting (dub, the only option available on the demo)was probably done by junior high students. With all that said, I did enjoy watching it in a Mystery Science Theatre kind of way with a friend of mine, so if you're looking for something so awful it's funny, rent Genma Wars. Otherwise spend your money elsewhere."
4,Must read for PL/SQL,"There are managers that think that ""everything"" can be done using PL/SQL. Well it can do lots of things, but as a programmer you will quickly find it's short comings. This book is a cvery handy tool when you are trying to do things you have never tried before."
2,Not one of his best!,"To be honest, this album was not enjoyed at all. My favourite type of music is raw, driving funk. I know Issac isn't known for funk but he has had an influence on it and vice versa. I thought the songs on this album were weak. It made me realize just how much of a role his voice plays in his music. The song The Birth of Shaft had high expectations due to the name but ended up being a rock influenced song with a repeated annoying riff. None of these songs pulled the album up after that and the synth use caused some of the songs to border on cheese. I have since returned the CD and am no longer a blind lover of Hayes."
1,Very poorly done,"This is a sad example of a movie. It had no rhythm, pace, storytelling or engaging acting/characters. None of the required elements to make a good movie even came close to sneaking into this one. The movie drags and drags through alternate haunted infirmary then police interview, back and forth incessantly. It flips back and forth so often that the entire story flow is destroyed. Further, there's no horror. Its at least 40 minutes into the movie before anything even remotely interesting happens, far too long. The acting is terrible. The interrogating cop, for example, should never set foot on a film set again. Avoid at all costs."
4,"Scrumptious, but...","Here's another one of Near East's delicious products, to provide a new kind of starch to your daily meals. These 5.6 boxes of couscous with pine nuts cook more quickly than rice --- in just five minutes. Here's a way for on-the-go families to quickly cook up a side dish to go with fish, chicken or red meat --- yet avoid rice and potatoes.Unfortunately, in this case, it's another item that we have foregone lately. Near East makes delicious food. However, it gets quite expensive to eat on a daily basis, and we have opted for mixed rice and couscous varieties from other sources, for lots less. Especially when one is on an increasingly tight budget, every little bit adds up."
3,A Day in the Life of a Stalinist Slave Camp,"Having read ""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"", I was intrigued when I found a copy of this play. As with many plays it may be easier to see this work performed than to read it. While it possesses many of the same qualities as ""One Day ..."", it has many more flaws.The main plot shows Rodion Nemov, a new prisoner losing his idealism to Lyuba Nyegnevitskaya. As they fall for each other, the unanswered question is whether Nemov is willing to keep their happiness secret as Lyuba gains luxuries while living with a doctor. Even if this is the main story, it seems to occupy little actual text. The story is flooded with so many characters, it is often difficult to track who is doing what. Certainly, this sacrifices some of the nuances that Solzhenitsyn was trying to portray.I really like the concept behind this ""indecent proposal"" storyline in a Stalinist labor camp. Unfortunately, it might be hard to tell the story in more widely scattered wreckage."
3,Yet to be convinced,"Documentation (in many languages) was not very helpful. There should be a simplified ""5 easy steps"" or something. Not sure if I can do what I want to do with this unit. I thought I would be able to play my guitar into the interface, and hear the sound through the computer speakers, but it appears I can only hear the sound through the earphones connected to the interface. There does not seem to be any way to select the computer speakers as the output. However, I will persevere............ Happy with Amazon service."
1,rip-off,"Said that it works with vista, and yet it doesn't. It actually somehow managed to disable my soundcard after attempting to install their driver. Nothing a reboot wouldn't fix but come on, that's ridiculous. Someday when my labtop gets back from being repaired I'll try it on windows xp, but how hard is it to make a product that works? This company Behringer is pretty shady too. It says it includes a bunch of guitar software (which to be honest I didn't even care about) but after looking at it, three of them are 30 day trials! Oh alright they give you a cupon to unlock one of them after the 30 days are up, psssh."
2,"Works ok, for a while","I was very excited to get the Guitar/USB interface. I used it to connect with GarageBand on a MacBook Pro and with my guitars(Peavey JF-2 and LTD MH250NT). It performed well and for just about a year, it worked. I did have to increase the gain in GarageBand and had a few issues with it creating feedback. This causes GarageBand to adjust internally and produces a dialog box with some options.The good:No set up required on the Mac. It was instantly recognized and provides a solid signal to the software. The modeling amp software included was interesting and if you were to pipe your gig through a computer, it would perform well with not crashes under Mac OS X 10.5.The badAs soon as the warranty expired, it fried out on me. I am not sure if I want to buy another one to replace it. I wish someone would build a bluetooth or wi-fi adapter for computer input."
1,Dont buy it until they repair their software issues,"Recently bought so I could play my guitar on the computer. Turns out that the Native Instruments software comes with a Trojan called huerengine.zerodaythreat. and McAfee DOES NOT protect you from it. It is apparently engineered around McAfee and Norton. Figured I would throw that out there. the Trojan was actually hidden in the ""Twang Combo.lnk"" file. This file opens the door and allows other trojans in including a key logger. Keep in mind that I wouldn't write this kind of review without cause. This was my experience and I wish to prevent others from having the same experience."
1,worst mistake,"Like many before me, I figured this seemed like a great one stop shop for recording my bass while making covers and demos, but since i managed to set it up, its been a massive disappointment. Setting it up was nowhere near as simple as advertised; I had to go through several forums before I even came close to a viable solution. Additionally, sound quality through the headphones output is terrible and quality of the recording too is not anything great....Definitely not worth getting"
2,espesa y nada entretenida,"Apesar de algunas laudatorias opiniones que he podido leer aqu?, el libro me ha parecido un co?azo de aqu? te espero. Algunas cositas est?n bien, propias de todos los libros de Reverte, pero en general es reiterativo y ""se le va la olla"" con sus disertaciones sobre la geometr?a del Caos y la t?cnicas pict?ricas. Probablemente, y despu?s del encargo de Cabo Trafalgar, haya sido sido si obra m?s personal y aut?ntica, pero a algunos nos ha descompuesto como una de esas v?ctimas suyas de la guerra. Resumiendo, el libro es poco comercial, lo cual seg?n se mire puede ser bueno o malo, pero desde luego nada entretenido. Al escritor le pesan demasiado sus m?s de 20 a?os de corresponsal de guerra y en ocasiones acaba por desgranar unas novelas de los m?s paranoicas y entreveradas."
2,pretty worthless for design,"I bought this book 7 years ago when I was trying to get into the industry. I'm a game designer now with six years of experience and I can tell you, this book really had very little to offer. Only part of the book covers actual game design and it doesn't go into much depth; I don't remember reading anything I didn't already know. Game design is a combination of creativity, user psychology and fundamental mechanics but this book seems to treat it almost as if it were a branch of programming that an engineer could pick up with a little extra study. If you want to understand games, study them -dissect what makes some fun and others not. If you want a book that gives an interesting perspective into game design, get Rules of Play."
2,"Great Stories, But Hard To Read","The stories in this book are wonderful. Hilarious accounts of cowboy life in the Wild West cattle camp of Wolfville, Arizona in the late 1800s.The typesetting in this book is unspeakably bad, however. It is apparent that proofreading and typesetting were omitted to cut costs. Frequent typos, clumsy punctuation and bizarre linebreaks make this book a chore to read."
2,It could be perfect but...,"If it only had headphones, volume control and read the story along with the child and had the princesses sing songs. It is an adorable little player and the book is great too. BUT....My 3.5 year old daughter wanted to hear singing princesses or the story read to her. She was disapointed.I wanted a headphone option and volume control. We are taking ours back tomorrow."
1,repetitive,"I really liked Mika's first album, True, and most of the songs on it were great, whether upbeat pop or soulful ballad. This album however, seems to be a complete mirror image of the first but all pale in comparison. In the end, her voice and songs all just seem to sound the same and the magic is gone."
5,My Fave Anime Ever,"This was the one anime that made me want to cry laugh and beg for more. When I got the first DVD I was hooked. Wonderful series that it was, the ending sucked. If you excuse my language of course. I did not expect it and it was odd not knowing the end of the story, though that enabled me to imagine a suitable ending. It really is a great DVD and I recomend it to anybody. The only thing kids should really worry about is the language."
5,Amazon's Title doesn't say it all,"The full title is ""...Folk & POP"". This CD is all Cambodian Rock/Pop music, from the 60's &70's plus some more recent pop which thankfully retains the spirit and flavor of the older stuff. If you like vintage Bollywood, or the 70's Ethiopiques releases you needn't hesitate. This CD is another find for hunters of exotic or quirky fun music. The whole Sublime Frequencies series is excellent, with only a couple of discs that are merely 4 Star, this is one of thier best. The CD is also beautifully illustrated with artwork from the original cassettes. In addition to this disc, there is a seeminly out of print CD titled ""Cambodian Rocks"" which is even wilder than this one."
4,Black Cat Raiders,"The book is very readable; however, the seller's report of ""good"" condition did not mention that there is extensive underlining throughout the book. Amazon could be more definitive in defining condition categories."
1,PATHETIC MOVIE!,WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HORROR? EVEN THE 80'S DIDNT RELEASE TRASH LIKE THIS.CAN THESE FILM MAKERS NOT SEE HOW BAD THEY ARE? THESE MOVIES ARE SHOT LIKE CHEAP PORN NO STORY JUST BAD VERY BAD ACTING. THE EDITING HAS TOO BE A HOME MADE JOB. I WISH AMAZON WOULD SHOW PREVIEWS OF THIS WASTE OF MONEY TRASH SO WE CAN HAVE AN IDEA BEFORE WE BUY IT. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH ON THIS AND DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS. I WAS SUCKED IN BY THE COVER. IT SEEMS THE STUDIO KNOWS HOW TO DO A GOOD COVER BUT THAT IS ALL. I LIKE HORROR MOVIES BUT THIS IS AN INSULT ON THE HORROR GENRE. STAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS ONE!
2,hmmmm nothin special,first of all this ain't a movie and it's nothin special its ok.the fights are quite good but it does not compare to dragonball z
1,Broken right out of the box,Bought from another online retailer. Entire VCR side not working from right out of the box. Vendor tested and confirms entirely defective. Don't waste your money.
5,Great bluesy songs that tells the story of this great artist,"Angry Southern Gentlemen is one of the best and well put together albums I have heard in a long time. I first became introduced to the music of Terrell in 1996 when his song ""Hopeful Sinner"" was reviewed in the New Music Review. After hearing that song, I was completley blown away by him, so I bought Angry Southern Gentlemen.Each song on this album is a story that is unfolding.... my personal favorites are the title track ""Angry Southern Gentlemen"" with it's sorrowful tale of a southern boy who decides to leave his home and never return, ""The Toy Store"" about a poets dream about meeting everyone from Galelio to Bob Dylan in their next incarnation at where else? A Toy Store! And my final picks is ""Red Neck Gigalo""This is a great album! Buy it! Try it out!"
5,Kidsongs: I Can Dance!,"This episode is awfully talented! Each Kidsongs VHS tells a story. This one is about, you guessed it! Dances! The Kidsongs Kids teach Ruby and Billy how to dance. All of the songs in this VHS are cool. The songs that are included in this adventure are:""I Can Dace!""""Dancing In The Street""""Chaleston""""Don't You Just Love To Waltz?""""Twist And Shout""""Mexican Hat Dance""""The Yellow Rose Of Texas""""Come On And Conga""""Barefootin'""Mashed Potato Time""""At The Hop""""I Can Dance""My 3 years old baby-sitting charge Garfield can't get enough of that VHS. He and I just love to watch it! If you are a Kid-At-Heart you will love it too. I am 17 years old. ""Kidsongs"" was and still is my fave TV-Show.Lots Of Love,Fulliem Q. XOXOXOXOXOXOXO"
3,Easily the most disturbing film on the planet,"Other than Crumb, this is the only move that I can recall having to turn off because I was too distressed. This movie gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach that remained with me for a long time afterwards. It's too creepy to really even do jusice to trying to describe so sufficeth to say that if you want a mind-blowing, bone-chilling experience then watch this film. You may wish you hadn't afterwards, but then again isn't that part of the fun?"
3,imitation and imolation,"Easily the saddest attempt at mimicking the ideas and theories of Antonin Artaud, Unica Zurn and Austin Osman Spare. At least it was an attempt though obviously so. There is certainly nothing new to be found here. I found it inspiring nonetheless, for its child-like understanding and reaching towards archetypal imagery, its infantile struggle to play the Rorschach.Luckily, Merhige has tried his hand at standard film making and found his calling there. I would say buy this film only, if you strive to shock or stimulate the easily shocked and stimulated or you are easily drawn to empty cups holding only the illusion of meaning and depth."
3,what the...?,"well, this is movie IS what people say it is. its bizarre, strange, weird, blurry, stupid, etc...all in one. for those people that like action, fast-paced and easy to grasp movies, this aint for you. and for those who are artistic, analytical, and interested in the grotesque...youve found the right movie. this movie explains the birth and death and birth of life itself. in this movie, every scene (or whatever you want to call what you see) has a meaning. nothing in this movie is meaningless. even the sounds give meaning to the movie. watch it. itll leave you thinking."
4,Rorschach on film,"The ""Begotten"" (1991) is directed by E.Elias Merhige (Shadow of the Vampire). It is something that I imagine Rorschach would have made if he had directed movies. This film is image after image of high contrast depictions that read like solarized images, negative images, that seem to flip back and forth, becoming almost like an ink blot where the imagination begins to take over. Influenced by early black and white films like ""Nosferatu"" it refers to the dark side of imagination. What is begot is the birth of imagination in this primordial land of primitive fears.This film comes as close to a visually abstract film as I have ever seen."
1,Terrible-worse than dog biscuits!,"Terrible item. Has the consistency of a dog biscuit, slightly moister, but doesn't taste as good! I chewed and chewed and couldn't swallow. Threw one at my dog an he chewed it and let it fall out of his mouth. Icky. There are much better sugar free items out there."
4,A Good Start for a great series,"I highly enjoyed this book and its setup. It was very creative and surprising, and not predictable. Each of the characters help the reader almost relate to the particular character. Vanessa is very popular and smart and has to cope with everyday problems as well as her powers. This is a great series and I was quickly hooked by this book."
4,Pretty good....,"this book is about a girl named Catty that can make herself invisible, but she doesn't know how or why. her best friend also has the power to travel back in time, but she thinks it's cool. they try to find out who is following Catty at night and why. they both find out that they are goddesses, daughters of the moon. this is an ok book, and i am looking forward to the reading the next one."
4,GREAT! But not thrilling!,"I loved this book, it hooked me to the series. But I just wish Vanessa wasn't such a wuss. She kinda grinds your nerves the way she lets people use her as a doormat. I do recommend you this book, but be aware the others to follow are much better."
5,Great Version of Mother Goose,This is from an early 20th century version of Mother Goose. It has some interesting rare poems and riddles WITH ANSWERS that are often quoted without them in other works.
2,Not the Values You Want to Teach Today,"I thoroughly agree with the person who said that this was not for today's child. With all that is going on in today's society, with increasing violence among our children, this version of Mother Goose does little to teach children tolerance. When I bought this book, I was expecting cute and innocent children's rhymes. I do not remember reading as a child Mother Goose rhymes that were so gory. Now, in all fairness, not all the rhymes are like that, however, you have to flip through the pages to read those that are more tame. I think many of these rhymes and stories had it's place in centuries past, but not in the 21st century.I am surprised that non of the other reviewers felt this way, too."
4,SUPER HIGH QUALITY POWER POP,"This new Rosenbergs disc is a worthy follow-up to their last disc. Catchy songs, memorable melodies (even if a little weak in the lyric dept.), great playing, super-fine 5-part glorious harmonies in the choruses and bridges of the guitar-backed songs...you gotta love that! For the record, standout tracks (for me) are ""Holding Pattern,"" ""Blue Skies,"" ""Gold Coast,"" and ""Pushing Up Daisies."" I would give it the fifth star, but lyrically it just isn't perfect for me."
1,More of the same,Grunge rock/alt. rock sucks and is the backbone for the trash on the radio we have today because it all sounds the same as any grunge band. Chris got good vox but that's it.
4,very good record.,"Soundgarden has always been a band that morphed from record to record,not because they were adrift but because of ""this is interesting"".They are grand experimentors in rock from the very beginning and this album is along the lines of Down On The Up Side."
5,Highlight for many occasions,"This film is a blend of raw humanity and brutal honesty. It was so refreshing to see the issues delt with done with so much style and not the usual sentimental [stuff]. As a huge Dolly fan and a director of performance myself, I have only this to say: Yes, Dolly is not a Liz Taylor, but few performers has ever reached her level of honesty in character and emotion when it comes to playing any character. Instead of boring crocedile tears, Dolly shows us inner pain - as does this whole film. This is a movie for people that understand what it means to hide your pain so that the show can go on. Deeply moving and profoundly liberating if you are able to leave soap operas behind you for a minute or two."
2,not what it seems,"This is actually not a movie. It is a concert strung together with glimpses of a tyranical father and scenes with a controlling boyfriend. After 30 minutes of having these scenes repeated, we have got the idea. There is an urge to say, ""Okay, okay, now move on to something else!"" But no. It's another 55 minutes of the same scenes and glimpses telling us the same things. There is one event only, after 85 minutes of film, in which she finally sees what the audience has seen ages ago: that her boyfriend is like her father. She sings for a record company and then--bang--another concert as a star.As a movie, this has to rate two stars.For Dolly fans and for people who like rockabilly, this will be worth the price.So, know what you're getting and be sure what you want. For Dolly AND a movie, I recommend ""Unlikely Angel"" or ""Straight Talk"" or even ""Rhinestone""."
2,Specs are not Detailed Enough,"I am not an expert in heating and ventilation and sure enough don't know much about bathroom fans. Never got around to testing the unit simply because it didn't fit our vent pipe in the bathroom. The shape of the pipe wasn't mentioned in the item description. This particular fan has round pipe and the one I have in my bath is square, of course. Doesn't take genius to realize that round and square don't go together for a proper fit..."
2,A Very Disappointing Dilemma.,"As you have probably read in other reviews, this Dvd has its glitches. The animation and sound are perfect, but the Japanese subtitles for episode 44, Yusuke's Final Test, are replaced with the Japanese subtitles for episode 45, Hiei Battles On. I would wait to purchase this Dvd until Funimation has fixed the problem."
3,Several good tracks,"A number of good tracks, especially IWIWAL which is hilarious, and Father/Daughter Dialogue.Several not-so-good songs as well, though - That Hospital is rather dreary, for example.Fairly average Loudo, not his best but not the worst either."
4,Good book based on evidence,"I received this book a couple of days ago and I have almost finished it. I like the fact that most of the information provided is based on scientific research and evidence. Some of the reviewers are correct when they explain that the book is brutal in terms of understanding some of the biology involved. However, it doesn't expect you to understand that we breath oxygen to gather electrons exiting the electron transport chain through oxidative phosphorylation. If you don't quite understand something, google it! What's wrong with enhancing your brain while enhancing your body? Spend a little extra time on adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The only gripe I really have is about Amazon. When I removed the book from the dry packaging I noticed that the first one-hundred pages were wet. Obviously, someone shipped it to me in that condition. No biggie though, I put my wife's blow dryer to it and other than a little waviness to the pages, it still reads just fine."
1,worse one yet,"the disco sweat was the worst one, i tried from richard simmons. he did not explain the dance moes, or go to a slow pace to start out with. I did not put up a sweat at all ! it was like just flopping your arms and hands mostly.the best one is swatn to the oldies two. he great. I give that a ten. he explains and does more differnt things than dance with all your body movements. he uses differnt things to help you get into shape at the right pace. my doctor says that is the best one , because it does cool downs, streching, and helps your body totaly. for get the disco sweat"
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this video because of the music, which was good. However, the actual workout was not. Richard does his own thing without cueing anyone else. He would go from grapevine to kneelifts to whatever without any warning, making it very hard to keep up. Also, when he did cue, he used unfamiliar terminology for standard aerobics moves. I've taken aerobics for 20 years and had never heard of some of his terms."
1,Richard Simmons - Disco Sweat,Can't review it because I had to send it back. I needed a VHS for the tape player in the tv located in the room I am working out in.
3,Good But Not Great,"It was typical wonderful Richard who we all know and love. A lot of the moves are done to the count of 4 instead of 8 which can be a bit hard to keep up with. Just when I get the hang of it, they switch up to the next move. I find I spend a lot of time trying to catch up. Granted, I am sweatin' but it would be a more productive sweat if it was doing the moves instead of trying to keep up with the change to the next move. I think they may have wanted to try to keep it interesting by changing the moves frequently but it was just a bit too much. The music is still great and Richard keeps us motivated as always. I'm still a fan of the original Sweatin' to the Oldies :)"
1,worst video i ordered,"I'm amazed at the 4-1/2 stars for this video, as it was the worst of all I have bought. Simmons doesn't tell what moves he's going to make, and only repeats them 2-3 times, so I was always playing catchup. Meanwhile, he sings over the background music, ruining the one redeeming value! The bizarre cinematography is often focused on one person's face, or knee, etc., so that the exercise isn't visible at all. I much preferred the ""Crunch"" series, especially Cardio Salsa, which I purchased at K-Mart. They explain the exercises, warn you when a change is coming, and I actually could follow along the first time."
4,Ok workout,Not as much fun as Super Sweatin'. I use it for variety. I love working out with Richard Simmons and this one did not keep up the fun as much but still a good workout.
5,get up and dance,have one month without cigarettes after smoking 41 years and 3 weeks of doing disco sweat...needless to say i couldnt exercise when i smoked.this is the best of the several simmons tapes ive gotten.the moves are simple to follow and the camera pans on the entire body instead of closeup of faces(which do not help in seeing what steps he's doing) you do sweat and it feels great..have done these exercises every day for last month.i especially like richards tapes because he has real looking people there. wish there was older people in this video(like me)but hey richard and i are of an age.good workout...BUY THIS VIDEO
5,Lift Your Spirits,"If you are familiar with Richard's other dance videos, you will surely enjoy this DVD of disco dances. The moves are easy to catch onto, if you have been following the other videos...they are similar as far as using the grapevine move, lunges, reaches, foward and backward, etc. The music is catchy and Richard is at his best. I highly recommend this to persons who love encouragement and fun during exercise, for Richard praises and adds humor throughout the workout. Five stars!"
3,Great Music and Motivation but not Enough Intensity,"The music is great, makes you want to keep dancing. Richard Simmons is also excellent when it comes to motivating his audience. However, I found myself wishing there were more high-intensity sections (there were some, but not enough to suit my tastes and preferences). But that was the only problem I found with this tape--had there been a few more high intensity sections included, I would be giving this a full five stars."
5,J MASCIS,"This is a really great album, down to the last track. Dinosaur Jr, Pavement, Archers Of Loaf, Sonic Youth, Texas Is The Reason one thing all those artists have in common is that you can't tell a good song from the first 5 seconds of it cause all these artists are great at pinning a precise mood over a precise segment of the song, you have to listen to the whole thing and it'll take you damn near any where. J Mascis i think is the god father of that unexplainable phenemanen (or how ever you spell it) of a technique"
5,Stunning,"When i first heard this, it instantly became one of my favorite albums of the genre. Truly stunning and magical."
1,Ear-splitting tripe,"Husker-Du may be a great band. This album does not show that. It is tuneless, artless and worthless. Bob Mould should be embarassed it is still for sale."
4,????,"This is a good anime. I fell in love with it, but the appeal is somewhat limited. It's about a girl named Miku who wants to become a great Neo Pro wrestling star and joins three others and a drunk for a coach. This one is actually very good, as Miku has to look hard within herself to find out how to beat Sapphire, with two secrets being revealed!"
3,Eh - it's not so bad.,"I have to admit that I thought this DVD would be alot more interesting than it was. It's kind of sad that it was so tame compared to the movie. Maybe, just maybe, if I had never seen the movie, the animated series would have seemed hilarious to me. It's still an interesting watch, even if it doesn't make me blow soda out of my nose. My 5 yr old likes it. :P"
5,Pure Animation !!!,I loved this dvd and the it is worth the money i think the animation is brilliant and the characters rock the great quotes from Jay make it that much better there is alot of humour and mad storyline's to each episode and it has a great sequence from Jay and Silent Bob before each cartoon comes on and they are classic.The special features rock aswell with the cration of how they made the characters and what earlier sketches looked like and the informative commentry by Kevin Smith himself and the rest of the Clerk's clan makes this an ultimate dvd for Kevin Smith movie fans and anyone intersted in great Animation.
3,Eh,"I've come to the conclusion that the reason CLERKS was yanked off the air is because it wasn't really that good. Of course, it didn't help that it received zero advertising and a horrible time slot, but those factors don't change the fact that the series is just...okay. Achingly okay.Truthfully, the lack of cursing and sex-talk wasn't the problem. The show simply had brilliant moments of comedy (""Who is driving? Oh my God, bear is driving."") stuck in amongst overly long setups (the origin of Leonardo Leonardo) and stuff I've seen too often to consider funny (the ""Duck Amock"" parody).Still, what makes the DVD great is the commentary and behind-the-scenes stuff narrated by Kevin Smith and the gang. Quite frankly, even bleeping out the curses, it was much funnier than the actual series. I recommend buying it just to keep your Kevin Smith collection complete. But don't hesitate to buy it used if you can (I got mine from Columbia House for a buck).SEAN"
1,Money wasted,"Things just seemd to get better for Kevin Smith, each movie seemed to take on more and take it on successfully. This cartoon series apparantly bombed on the networks and its easy to see why. Poor production masked by weak jokes about Korean animators, and plots that feel like they were lifted from the Simpson's and then dumbed down. Wish I had not ordered this."
5,if you have not watched clerks and clerks 2 then you are missing a lot,"Kevin Smith is very creative with his movies, i always like his humor and own all of his movies. a must have."
3,Rainmaker gets rained on,Think I liked it more than my kids. Not as realistic as some of the other rainmakers I have seen and used.
3,"Strange little skin, both pros and cons","While the skin made my Axim easy to hold, and the flip-up screen protector was easy to use, it was also a challenging skin to use.In order to place the unit into the charging cradle - or to swap out the battery with a fully charged one - you have to take the skin off, and that's not just a matter of slipping the unit out. There's considerable friction involved, so it's a bit of a pain.The way the screen shield attaches is also a little inconvenient; the shield often touches the Axim's screen when you try to flip it closed, which of course isn't ideal when you're at a potentially interactive screen.The edges of the skin also overlap the sides of the screen just a bit, so reading can be a bit of a challenge, as you get the first and last characters on a line cut off unexpectedly.It's a great (non water-resistant) protective measure, though."
2,Way over-priced --,"And who is the old woman? Edna -- ""Vincent"" -- or her sister?All in all, not much to it, especially as concerns enlightening the viewer about Edna St. Vincent Millay."
3,Hack? Check. Slash? Check. Excellent Game? Check.,Dungeon Siege is a fine game even six years after release.Dungeon Siege uses the standard hack n' slash formula:- Bare bones story- Bare bone character devolpement- Unquenchable thirst to find better equipement- Unquenchable thirst to play for only ten more minutes before you realize it is two AM and you've been playing ALL day.A pleasant surprise for me was the amazing soundtrack of Dungeon Siege. An unpleasant surprise for me was the lack of skill tree for the characters.If you are a hack n' slash gaming fan you must play this game.
4,For Ultima 5,"I only got this to play Ultima 5: Lazarus (uses this game's engine). That game is alright, but I do like the feel of it."
2,Esperaba Más / I Expected More,"No me malinterpreten: Ivy Queen es, en efecto, la reina del reggaetón. Precisamente por eso esperaba más contenido. Los videos no vienen completos, son unicamente estractos. El documental es mediocre, no le hace justicia a la diva. Sin embargo, vale la pena verlo una vez. Solo una vez..."
4,Read this if you're feeling trapped,"I read this book after a few months on my new job, working for a guy who was obviously promoted a few levels too hign. The best thing I came away with after reading this book was a sense of the bigger picture -- you are not this job, you have (or you should have) a life outside. They buy your time but not your being. There are a lot of tips on playing better office politics, which might come across as smarmy. But that's the game that's played by the people who will make your work life miserable, so you might as well learn the rules and a few tactics. I still work for the knucklehead, and he hasn't gotten any smarter, but until (and unless) a better opportunity comes my way, I have to deal with it. This book helps with that."
4,UUB gives it a shot,"Baby has been rampaging and is all but victorious. UUB has shown up to fight for the fallen heroes. Meanwhile, Goku is off training and is on the verge of reaching a level above Super Saiyan 3."
2,no battery life,"I love archos, and I love my Gmini 20 GB player, but the battery life is awful!If you have a long commute or you are out and about alot, this player will let you down. I turned the backlighting OFF, and the thing is still constantly running out of juice. I have a short commute, so Ill live, but BEWARE!Also, the seek is slow if you have long sets, and you cannot queue up your next track without stopping the current one.Plusses are it is a no driver needed (XP) filesystem view, which is nice for transferring work files, and it is tiny, sexy cool. I fear for the device when the lithium ion battery performance starts to degrade - I just got it and it sputters after a few hours use!!!"
5,Are you a Sci-fi fan?,"This has become my favorite series and I couldn't wait for it to come out on VHS. The show is the perfect combination of just about everything, it has a little comedy, a little drama, some serious moments, and science fiction that you want to believe in. You will find yourself rooting for these unlikely heroes and you wont be able to wait until the next episode. The story lines are unpredictable and only get better as the show goes on. The series is now going to go into it's third season and I can't wait. This set of tapes is the series premiere(and the 5 episodes that follow) and should not be missed."
5,A must for anybody even remotely interested in sf,"If, for some strange reason, you haven't seen Farscape yet then this is your ticket to a few hours of GREAT entertainment.In a nutshell, Farscape has believable characters, amazing plot twists, a lot of humour (but not the cheap LEXX style), brilliant sfx and a great cast (gotta love Claudia Black).Believe me, I'm trying hard to find something to criticise in this series but the best I can come up with is that the basic premise isn't all that original. Other than that, Farscape takes the best of Star Trek and Babylon 5, adds a few nice twists and voilà, you have the sf show of the decade."
2,Whatever happened to Hannibal??!!,"What the hell happened to the Hannibal Blu-Ray, Manhunter looks pretty decent and so does SOTL.Hannibal on the other hand, the movie where imagequality actually matters the most is completely useless. I was alredy diappointed by the german version which actually looks very good but had the wrong aspect ratio and some of the image cropped. So I thought MGM would do a better job ... mistake. Now i have two versions that suck ... but hell, at least in a different way. Now I'll get the british version and hope for the best, but it will probably just get even more disappointing... If you hate Hannibal, get it for the other two movies which look good. Now this is after Gladiator the second failure in image quality for a ridley scott movie ... waiting for a rerelease..."
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting a different storyline, not just a different version of the same. It was an ok version with different actors, but not great, and not what I was hoping for based on the description of the product."
5,"Classic, fantastic horror set","I recently bought Hannibal Rising, and was very impressed. It reminded me of the horrific energy I remembered from the earlier Hannibal Lecter movies.It's been years since I've seen the earlier movies, so I bought this set from Amazon. I also ordered Red Dragon, individually. It has not yet arrived.All of these movies are excellent. They're some of the best horror movies I'd seen in decades. I love this boxed set."
4,The Hannibal Lecter Collection,"I love Thomas Harris, but also love Anthony Hopkins and wish he was in all 3 movies. Also, I prefer the other actor who plays Graham in Red Dragon to the one in Manhunter. I have seen these movies enough that it doesn't seem right to see different stars in it, especially Graham."
5,Always Great!!!,"These are ALWAYS great !!! I would recommend them to any child of any age. My grandkids LOVE them, I have bought them a lot of them and they never tire of them.It is so refreshing to have kiddos to listen to something that is based on morality and integrity."
5,Wilderness Medicine Beyond First Aid,I found everything I was looking for.The book was very informative and I feel it would be a great help if needed.I think with the coming events it would be a good idea to have this and or other books of this type on hand.
5,Best movie of all time,About a good man doing the right thing. More people should live a live like this man and woman did.
5,Hide a rock or hide a key,My daughter was recently locked out of her house and was only able to gain entrance by driving 20 miles to get my copy of her house key. She won't have to do that now
2,Very simplified reconstructions,"The Achaean warriors reconstrutions are very generic and simplified. The books laks in several important findigs and art representations (pottery, fresco, sculpture) of armour/corselets elements, weapons, shields, helmets etc... coming from the Late Helladic time.No accurate and detailed research has been made for this book."
5,could not stop laughing,"Tyler Perry is the best! Another great play, wish they would put more stuff like this in theatre's and on tv."
4,Tight,"I ordered this CD & it came pretty soon unbroken, unbattered. The CD is good if you like hardcore, dancehall reggae. There are a few things that will surprise you, but they only give you a look into the everyday world of Jamaica's hoods (similar to the ones in the US). If you like to listen or dance, you'll like this one."
3,Substandard Packaging,"I already had Seasons 1 through 3 and the packaging for Season 4 is of a lower-quality than the previous three ... at least the version Amazon is selling ... it's no longer the book-style package. The picture on the back of the degraded packaging displays the older and superior style which leads me to believe both are available. I'll check the local brick-and-mortar stores to determine if the previous packaging is available for Season 4. If yes, I'll return this and gladly pay more for packaging consistency. If no, then I'll just complain about this latest example of getting shortchanged."
3,hit and miss,"the jokes are good half the time only. the show hasnt aged well. still if you grew up watching it like i did, its worth it if your a fan of any of the castmembers."
2,Choose a different episode,"I purchased three episodes of the old SNL with an Amazon coupon I received for ""unbox."" My husband and I tend to fondly remember the ""old"" SNL, putting it up on a pedestal and dissing the new SNL. Watching this episode, we decided that nothing has changed in the past 35 years of SNL. The show has moments of brilliance and moments of mind-numbing dullness. This episode falls into the latter category. The sketches were unfunny or dated or both. Some of it we were unable to ""get,"" possibly because we were too young when the show came out. Choose a different hosting night to purchase and you'll be fine. For me, the only funny segment was ""Quien es mas macho"" with Bill Murray doing a pretty good job of hosting a game show 100% in Spanish. Of course, then even that skit degrades and goes from funny to offensive."
4,Rockin 70's unknowns,"This is a fairly unknown 70's hard rock band. Their biggest ablum was nature of the beast, but in my opinion this is a better album. It is faster and more upbeat where NOTB was heavier and darker.Their best work was ""Live at the El Macombo"" where they opened up for the stones, sadly that album seems to be unavailable.If you like this genre and are looking for more off the wall bands in the same vein try Fastway as well.Fastway"
5,Great example of pre-hair band rocking,"Late 70's early 80's was a great time in rock music. Punk had come along with bands like the Ramones and the Clash, Metal had taken hold with bands like Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Judas Priest. This was the first I had heard of April Wine, and I think I bought it for the cover, as the car looks like the 75 Dodge Duster I used to drive. I was very pleasantly surprised when I put this on the turntable and it rocked!! I Like To Rock, Tonight, 21st Century Schizoid Man, all made this a great album that we played over and over during the summer of 1980. I recently thought about this band again after seeing Frank Marino play in October of 2005, (he is still rocking out like nobody's business), and picked up this CD. It sounded as great as the first time I remember hearing it at age 17, fresh, slightly raw, great guitar work, catchy hooks. Album is somewhat short, as was common at the time, a little over 30 minutes, but not a dull one."
5,into the cold fire,"I LOVED THIS BOOK!! Each books lets you get to know these gifted 15 year olds. My favorite right now is Vaness, but Sernea, Catty, and Jimena are cool. THis book taught me a lot about friendship and ways to deal with situations, though I don't think I can turn invisible. I read Goddess of the Night, book one, and I loved it also. I read both in two days. I can't wail for Night Shade (book three) wiht Jimena as the narrator."
3,way too predictable,"Serena Killingsworth is a daughter of the Moon. She and her goddess friends Catty, Vanessa and Jimena are protecters of the planet Earth. They battle the Atrox (the oldest force of evil) in every book. This book is the easiest to pick up who the Followers are... Suddenly Jimena is having premonitions that Serena will become a follower and then (of course part of the recurring plot) a boy shows up. Serena falls madly in love with him and the best part for her is she can't read his mind because all of his thoughts are in a different language. Jimena's premonitions start happening. wanna know what happens?? Read the book, just don't think too hard."
4,"the good, the bad, and the ugly","Well, I have to admit that even I couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting. It was certainly too short, rather low in reading level, and awfully predictable. However, I (like many others) was drawn in by the moon goddess stuff. The plots are compelling, and I never tire of the good-versus-evil theme. The modern setting was a great twist that added a lot to the books. Come on, the minions of evil hanging out at clubs? Sounds good to me. Another very, very catchy bit was the way both sides (Atrox and goddesses) go completely glam whenever they have it out. Oh-so-chic. The gory detail of the relationships between Michael and Vanessa and Serena and Stanton is a little much. Yes, they like each other, that's nice, but Ewing has gone overboard. I suppose it has a low-brow appeal, but it seems out of place in such a snazzy (sorry, that was the best word) book. All in all, a fun (though not particularly enlightening) read."
4,You get your money's worth.,"I think this is a fairly low price for the number of videos you get. My feelings about the selection of videos are mixed. There are plenty of songs/videos I like here; there are also plenty that have the power to make me change the station when they come on. The really nice surprise, though, was the Jungle Brothers video. My husband, my brother and I weren't familiar with the song, but we loved the video--it was vastly entertaining.I think most people can find things they like about this collection and things they don't like; I also think we can all agree that getting four decent DVDs for approximately the price of one or two is a pretty good deal."
1,A neat idea gone very wrong.,"Remarkably, less than 80 minutes of material on each disk. Beyond that, the video choices are highly debatable, which could be fun but winds up being frustrating since MTV's choices are so questionable so often. (The Pop DVD is especially awful - ""Tubthumping""????; the Rock DVD is closest to worthwhile.)Save your ... and videotape the ""Buggles to Bizkit"" special - a much better retrospective that MTV is likely to eventually repackage and sell anyway."
5,What a group!,"What a wonderful folk group! They are my favorites after ""The Weavers"" and ""The Limeliters"". If you like folk music, buy this cd right now!"
2,Deviates greatly from the novel,"Although Marc Warren gives a respectable performance as the Count, this BBC/Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel is a far cry from the source material. Several characters and events are omitted in favor of a wildly out-of-place subplot involving a syphilis-infected Arthur Holmwood and his dealings with a Dracula blood cult. With its rushed pace and brief 90-minute running length, it appears to have been a hurried production and heavily edited for its U.S. airing. One would expect a more faithful version of a literary classic from the BBC and Masterpiece Theatre."
1,What were they thinking?,"This was just plain awful! Mina is a very strong female character in the novel, not the wimp portrayed in this production. There is a perfectly good plot in Bram Stoker's book. No need to rewrite the story, especially in such a bad way. Shame on you, Masterpiece Theatre! I was already mad at you for the fiasco which was the latest production of Jane Eyre."
1,Difficult circumstances,"The transmission of this video was so poor, probably due to buffering problems, that viewing was near impossible. Hence, the connection was severed and you gave an uncharacteristic refund. I am not sure that access to items from your site will be attempted again. Suggestions?"
4,Cute book but 3 year old is scared of it,"This is a cute book with a good message about listening to directions. However, my 3 year old is scared of the scruffy varmint who scares Buddy, the little rabbit, into listening. Cute pictures too though."
3,Some unnecessary annoyances...,"Forced ads are just plain evil. I always watch trailers (once) anyway, so why make me sit through 2 minutes of ads for other shows every time I put the first disc in? Whoever thought that was acceptable should be ashamed of themselves. In protest I'm crossing Mr. Monk off my shopping list...The discs are also double-sided, which is made even more of a pain because they're incorrectly labelled (the labels should be on the opposite side to the data, but here they aren't). Worse there's no inlay or episode list, so you have to be very careful you watch them in the right order.I hope they drop the (admittedly cute) ""Parka"" and put more effort in other areas of the presentation next season."
1,"Poor Quality DVD, Great Show","I'm glad I didn't purchase this! I checked it out from the library, instead.The poor rating is for the DVD, not the show. The show is very good.The DVD is poor quality. The sound quality is terrible and the volume is erratic. It seems that very little effort was put into converting these shows to DVD. Fans would have better quality copies if they taped reruns."
5,Northern Exposure Rocks!,"If you are a Northern Exposure fan, this is a must! The cool orange parker that covers the DVD case is a nifty treat too. My wife & I love this show. What is interesting is that we never saw the pilot or episode 1. It really helped as it helped establish Joel's hatred of his position in Cicily.As for the person who was complaining about the lack of show in the ""Complete First Season"" set, I would have to ask how would you add more shows to the first season?Now we can't wait for Seasons 2, 3... Mike in the geodesic dome. . .Enjoy!"
4,Where's the pilot episode?,It's on side 2 of the first disk that's where. The boneheads mislabeled the disks. I feel cheated - I watched it out of order.
1,Not the Series - The DVD sets.....,"IF you did not have the opportunity to see the TV series ""Northern Exposure"", then you may enjoy these DVDs. However, what you will miss is the actual TV series. What did he say? The DVD sets offered here are NOT the TV series as televised. As one reviewer bravely noted, and most others simply passed on by, is the creative genius of the TV series as televised. That includes the original music delightfully inserted with an artist's touch. Whoever made the decision to remove the original musical excerpts defaced a work of art imo. In short, if you've got money to burn and just want to see a few favorites episodes, go for it. Better yet, watch the re-runs. IF you are really a fan, find somebody, anybody, who taped each episode. I wish I had. It's a crime to mess with an artist's Art."
4,Just Glad It's Finally Here!,"Okay...would I have been happier if this set had included more than eight episodes? Definitely! Would I have preferred a better price? Absolutely! But finally seeing these early episodes again with digital quality was certainly worth all of the aggravation. Besides, having a Costco membership helped the bitter pill go down a little easier ($34.95 Wink, wink).Would have liked to see a little more in the way of special features beyond the typical deleted scenes and outtakes, as well."
5,My baby loves it,My baby loves it. Just seeing him focused on the TV with his big blue eyes is a beautiful sight. The Dvd works like a babysitter when we need 30 minutes alone and get stuff done around the house. Every parent knows how important that 30 minute break is and this Dvd definitely gives us that.
3,Ahead of Their Time,"Canadian hard rockers April Wine were just a tad ahead of their time with their best studio album ""The Nature of the Beast"" and their biggest hit ""Just Between You and Me."" Had they waited a few more years when the power ballad had become THE hot phenomenon of (far less talented) hair bands, they might have become superstars. As it was, the song got somewhat lost amid the Duran Durans and Culture Clubs that dominated the airwaves in the early 1980s. The album starts out strongly with the tartly rocking ""All Over Town,"" and ""Telling Me Lies."" Unfortunately, by the second half it runs out of steam, as the band itself did not too many years after its release.Overall, an interesting period piece that in at least one important way was a harbinger of things to come."
2,Teenage Mutant Ninja Carter?,"I grew up with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, And I will always, ALWAYS love them but this season. I'm sorry, but this just is not the Turtles we all grew up with and loved. It focuses more on this new guy, Carter, and that mutation they take on is just hideous looking. I miss the days of Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady. Now that was TMNT. April is barely even in these, and as annoying as most think she is, she was my favorite character for the humans. This season is just one big disappointment and it pains me to even say such a thing!"
2,Surprisingly amateurish,"As another reviewer mentioned, I purchased this book on the strength of it being mentioned numerous times as ""another great time travel book."" It was appallingly badly written. The concept was very good; it's a shame Thompson didn't have the services of a good editor for simple things like repetitive use of adjectives. This sort of thing can be simply remedied and make the author eminently more readable. The dialog was laughable (not humorous, but really strained, unrealistic). The descriptions stretched credibility, e.g., hard for women to run in tight skirts and high heels, etc. I pushed on through the book. The resolution was amusing. But, overall, a huge disappointment."
5,Good enough for me,"Being a mother who is very concerned about what I buy for my child, I tend to be very critical of products on the market. I was always a little skeptical about educational videos for toddlers but when I got the Forest Ranger Dvd as a gift I was very pleased with my baby's reaction to it. He was very focused and interested in what was on the screen. I give the video a high rating because if my child agrees then it must be something good."
4,"Morris S. Zedeck, Ph.D.","Dr. Pappas, with many years of experience in the biotechnology industry and as a biotechnology consultant, has compiled a unique glossary aimed at the biotechnology entrepreneur. It is unique in that it bridges the fields of science, business, law and marketing- all essential for the operation of a successful biotechnology business. The eight appendices that include acronyms, biotech recruiters and venture capitalists interested in biotechnology provide much useful information that is not readily available elsewhere. Dr. Pappas did all the legwork to provide a single reference source with a wealth of information. I am sure the biotechnology entrepreneur will find it useful and refer to it often."
5,A MASTERPIECE,THIS IS A MASTERPIECE PROBABLY TOO ARTISTC FOR THE MASSES TO COMPREHEND. THIS BAND OR AT LEAST THIS ALBUM RANGES IN SEVERAL MUSICAL STYLES AND IS NO LESS THEN A WORK OF SHEER BRILLIANCE AND GENIUS I CAN TRULEY APPRECIATE. I FIND IT MUCH BETTER THAN THEIR LATER WORKS.
5,Great cd,I love this cd it's so great!! And the music is just wonderful. So if you like music that relaxes you get it.
2,It stick at times,"You would need to reattach it at times for the air to start flowing and the needle in the chuck sticks in the open position, so when you remove it from your tyre, air keeps flowing out of the chuck instead of sealing itself off.."
1,more,This movie has no business being placed in a list of erotic movie there is nothing erotic about rape.
2,Does not deliver,"I saw this on the big screen and I was very disappointed. The producers were going for a film which would leave it's audience questioning their own views on sex and love, but it did not. Throughout the movie the cast remarked about life, love and sex trying to sound profound but succeeding in sounding fickle. The most interesting part, and the reason I gave it 2 stars, was the way the cast protrayed the recollection of the same event by two different people of the opposite sex. The film should have focussed on that plot and developed it further. The rest of the movie was actually a waste of time."
2,NOT QUITE,"I have the movie Body Shots it started out just about them having sex. About the middle of the movie the plot just changed It suddenly became about a mystery and trying to solve it. Great acting (Tara Reid, Amanda Peet) TERRIBLE ENDING does not even have an ending you expect the movie to start after the credits. I liked what they were doing with the movie at the beggining but then it got jumbled and confusing. If you like rape sex movies with bad plots then this movie is for you if not dont waste your time."
1,Worst Movie Ever,I saw this movie in the movie theatre and was disgusted by it. I think it is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Don't waste your money or your time watching this.
1,Body Shots,Foul language was use for its shock value rather than supporting the film. The plot was very jerkey and did not flow very well. It was so boreing that I could not finish watching it. It fails as a comedy and as a porn flick. Not sure what it was trying to accomplish. Truly a waste of money.
1,50% of what you asked for,"The clock worked fine but the outside remote temperature was a bust and never really properly worked, even with the remote sending unit less than 10 feet from the clock. I got the temperature to show twice but it kept losing signal and I would have to open the back of the sending unit and press the transmit button again. We had a clock with the same features and it worked properly for a number of years until its remote temp sending unit quit. I am not sure if I just received a defective unit and all the rest work fine but I returned this one and was refunded the purchase price as advertised in all Amazon purchases. Thank you Amazon for standing behind what you sell!"
2,Take with a BIG grain of salt!,"Initially, I was bowled over by this book. After a year spent teaching English in China, fellow foreign teachers (many of whom had studied China and Chinese for years) and I realized how self-serving the book is. Salzman frequently compliments himself in terms of his fluency in Chinese--of course, there is no way for the reader to get any sense whether his perception is correct! Most foreigners find fluency extremely difficult to obtain. Furthermore, Salzman indicates that many Chinese found him to be quite special--never mind that he wrote in an era when any American (let alone one studying martial arts) in China would be considered very ""exotic."" Once I realized these central problems in the book, they undermined my trust in his perceptions. (For example, does anyone else think his description of biking with the young Chinese woman is a bit creepy?)"
3,Just buy the b-side,"Flower was the first single release from Soundgarden'sUltramega OKalbum. Like most CD singles, the real value is in the b-side. Both Flower and Head Injury can be found on Ultramega OK, but Toy Box is exclusive to this single. It's a really great song, slow, plodding and doomy in a Black Sabbath kind of way. It's well beyond b-side quality, but I can see how it wouldn't have fit with Ultramega OK's overall sound.Flower is really only for die-hard Soundgarden fans who really want to have all of the band's recordings, and considering the fact that you can buy a download of Toy Box here for less than a buck, it's hard to recommend buying this expensive CD single."
5,A great typical Descendents cd,"Well, this is probabbly one of the less great Descendents album, but it is awesome with great flatulence sounds!"
1,Don't let the picture fool you,"I was wondering why I could not find this hard case anywhere that the Tungsten was sold, and I had to order it online.Upon receipt of the case I figured out why: on the internet you can fool people by showing them a picture of an ""aluminum"" case and it looks aluminum. You can't fool people when the item is right in front of their eyes.Do not be fooled: this case is made of ... plastic. The hinge is also made of plastic, and every time I open the case it feels like it is about to crack in half.If you are left-handed, this case will not feel ergonomic in your hand, as the person from Ireland pointed out below.When the item this case is supposed to protect is more rugged than the case itself, you know you have a problem.It is a shame that such a well-made, classy item like the Tungsten does not have a decent case to hold it."
1,Not much of a recipe book.,"If you are looking for a juicing book with numerous recipes, color pictures, etc. this is not the book for you. This book tries to connect certain recipes to specific conditions such as acne, age spots, aging, allergies, and so on down the alphabet. Many of the recipes are repeated throughout the book because they supposedly work for multiple conditions. This book is printed on low grade, almost newspaper print paper with no illustrations. The only color in this book is on the cover. The two pages that you can preview illustrate how the whole book is written, all 350 pages."
3,Good but not great,"These are ok, but the Annie's elbows & 4 cheese is much better. In my opinion shells are not as good for macaroni and cheese. Elbows have a better texture and they trap cheese inside the elbow tubes. These shells are also too small, and the cheese in the pouch is not as tasty as Annie's 4 cheese sauce. Get the Deluxe 4 cheese instead, it's much better."
2,Arguably the Mup's most dull offering.,"Maybe I'm in the minority here, but this record just sounds dull and uninspired. The sound here is based around cheesy outdated 80's metal for the most part. Just awful production with no real push to it... I just seriously dislike this record. The lyrics sound boring and forced, which just doesn't feel like Curt Kirkwood's style to me. I'm all about growing as an artist, but this record should have been out of print long ago.There are a few somewhat redeeming monets, though. ""Light"" is a pleasant enough song, and ""Touchdown King"" is a fine example of their mid-period sound at it's best. ""Party Till The World Obeys"" is *almost* a really good song... but the lackluster production turns it into a boring thud. The best bet on this record is the acoustic ""Like Being Alive""... even though that would have been the weak link on any previous album.Some swear by this record... I just swear *at* it for being such a wasted oppurtunity."
2,Almost Unlistenable,"If you're not already a fan, don't count on liking this. The track that's getting all the airplay - The Dark Is Rising - is quite beautiful and got me to buy the record (along with the glowing reviews.) But the rest of the album doesn't live up to the promise of that song at all. Do yourself a favor and buy every Flaming Lips or Sparklehorse record before you buy this one."
3,"Good videos, horrible DVD","The videos are good and it's interesting to see the differences between the US versions and the Canadian versions. But there's nothing there besides the videos and the navigation between the songs is horrible. If you want to see how a musician should do a DVD, check out the Indigo Girls: Watershed. Superior navigation, explanations and interviews."
5,I love Sarah!,"Sarah McLaughlin's music is wonderous and enchanting. If you like Sarah, then this DVD is for you! It's sound and picture are wonderful and you get to see Sarah at different parts of her career. A definite must have for any die hard Sarah fan!"
3,Very overrated,"Not a bad film, with the closing fight being very good. But this is NOT the greatest kung fu film of all time, not by a mile."
1,(...) i was so dissapointed,(...) The very reason i had purchased this movie was because many people gave it good reviews i thought this was a Gordon Liu movie it wasnt but he was in it. Big deal! that didnt help because this movie was weak no matter what.Im thinking this movie would be more serious but there were a lot of goofy characters and they kept talking about pugilism whatever that is i dont know if its magic or what.Because this movie is dubbed that makes it seem to have nothing to do with what it is about.And what it is about (...) I do not know cause it is silly and makes no sense to me. (...)
4,Matches my Kitchen,"It's pretty much just as I expected and I like it overall. The only problem is that is Utensil Crock is pretty big, you need a lot of stuff to fill it or the utensils ""slouch"" inside."
4,pretty and sturdy,"I have lots of utensils and like to have them within easy reach while I am cooking. This crock works perfectly for that. I like the heaviness and the capacity, and love the vibrant red color. The only drawback is that the base is too wide to sit conveniently on my stovetop."
2,Robert Downey Jr movie,Movie was boring and predictable. Robert Downey played a good part but e movie spends a lot of time in his childhood. It's ok but I found myself fast forwarding through it to find out how it ends.
2,Great PDA if the backlight doesn't burn out,I've had my PDA for about a year and never had a major problem however one month after the extended warantee expired my backlight burned out. The color screen is useless without it. This is a chronic problem with the sony Clie's. They offer very little support for this problem if your expensive pda burns out. A know design flaw that cost as much as the pda to fix. Don't buy a sony Clie if you can't afford to replace the unit after a year.
3,not for me,"Often a good director can add some amusing or clever touches that actually make the opera more fun to watch. Such additions usually require a light touch and when done well are enjoyable. The modern dress and other anachronisms such as cigarette lighters and lighting up before an aria, a bullhorn, pepper spray, etc. were not amusing or clever. The pepper spray was particularly annoying, I thought. On the other hand, I'm probably just an old fuddy-duddy, and perhaps you will like this production. I didn't."
3,Horror of Hammer: Cool Trailers,"TO: Hammer Film FansThe Good:This is an incredible collection! It has 53 trailers. Buy It! It even has bonus feartures! There is an alternate Dracula AD 1972 trailer, and an alternate Countess Dracula trailer. It has every hammer film imaginable on it, except Prehistoric Woman/Slave Girls. Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires & Satanic Rites Of Dracula are under more obscore alternate titles to hide them. They both stink, and there trailers damage the collection. I just wish I culd get a hammer collection free of them I really do.FROM: The Hammer Film Reveiwer (Reveiwer of all that is hammer!)"
5,SO I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE LIFE HAPPENS TO,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL, EASY, LIGHT HEARTED, AND GUILTFREE BOOK. EVERY MOM REALLY NEED TO TAKE THE TIME TO GET THIS ONE....IT IS PERFECT, VERY SHORT STORIES! THANK YOU MRS CRAKER FOR YOUR HONESTY IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE!"
5,Piece of Quiet,"Lorilee Craker has got to be the funniest writer I have read on motherhood. This book is set up for short reads. I read a little two or three page blurb before bed and it has validated me as a momma and remind me that ""I am not the only one"". Craker has a definite gift at conveying her humor, I can't wait to read another book by her!"
5,Good product!,Attaches easily to my Jet ski. Stays secure when moving and well made. No noted problems.
2,not impressed,I have a '11 yamaha fx sho. I wanted this to work to protect the sides of my ski. I just doesn't work very well. There is no good way to keep the hugger where it is supposed to stay. I would not buy this. I would buy one that comes with clips to attached to the gunnel. That would make the product worth the money.
2,Disapointed,Purchase the CD thinking it was a concert in Jamaica. The content is mostly talking and then they have the taping of the talking. Very little music.....
4,Great music and great insight into Ryan Adams,As a fan of Ryan Adams most people are also fans of raw acoustic and stripped down music. This DVD provides an insight into both. As he travels he plays great tunes that he is able to adapt to the musical style of each location and the people he meets. The music is great and the sound quality is even better. It is also a nice look at the more relaxed and creative side of Ryan Adams. I recommend it to any fan.
5,Huge fans!,"I bought an Uncle Johns reader years ago at a remaindered book store. A few years later my Father sent me another for a gift and to our surprise our 10 year old couldn't put them down. My wife bought him Kidtopia from a local store and with his birthday coming up I went online and found there were quite a few geared towards kids. He just opened this one today and has only just started but I can tell he loves it as he continually stops reading to ask us, ""Did you know?"""
5,Great story,Great story. The end was very tragic. It was a very good book. I liked it allot it was very good
5,tigerstar,"this is the best warriors book.shadowclan has a new evil leader and a pack of dogs has entered the forest.an apprentice dies [but i am not going to say who it is.]bluestar thinks starclan is trying to destroy thunderclan,and fireheart wonders if she is right."
4,Wow great book,I only give it a four because the clan was at war with star clan and blue star dies also I was wondering were did tigerstar get the dogs
4,"Harmonious, a little edge, a little folk, a lot of talent","I caught these fine-sounding ladies at a recent Tractor Tavern show--went in expecting only Jess to perform--and got more than my money's worth when Erin, Beth, and Rose, along with Jess, opened up the night with a smooth and beautiful quartet round-robin number, and the performance just got better with every song. They each have a unique style and when blended together it makes for a captivating, goosebump-generating sound. Erin was the hit, for sure; she belts out the tunes (and plays her guitars) with humor, talent, and a little 1940's blues/jazz thrown into the mix--if you can catch this group live, do so."
4,NEVER SAY GOODBY,"For those WWII fans, this is a very good book. I found it a little draggy in the middle, but was still worth the read. I enjoy all of HILARY GREEN'S books. Keep them coming."
5,Owned since August 2004,I used this espresso maker daily for a bit over a year and then intermittently since. I use the frother almost every time and the entire unit still works perfectly. If you keep it clean and follow the instructions for maintenence you shouldn't have any problems. I love it. It makes great espresso and it saves money on my trips to coffee shops.
1,Crash and Burn,After 6 months of decent joe the steam pump failed. I now own a Gaggia and have no more watered down milk. Krups produces a 'wet steam.' The Gaggia unit is much better product.
4,Palm Sleeve Case works well,"I like most of the features of the Palm Tungsten T Sleeve Case. It is certainly much better than the plastic plate that comes with the Tungsten. The case has a sturdy feel and protects the PDA very well. As advertised it is slim and fits easily in my pocket. I like the catch that holds the Case closed. It is very convenient to open but never pops open unexpectedly. It is a little clumsy to slide the Tungsten PDA open. I also wish that I did not have to remove the PDA prior to synchronization, although it is not hard to take it in and out. All in all it is a good product."
1,Classy looking watch - poorly made,"Purchased for Valentines day - my g/f got a similar red heart watch from this company. This watched lasted 7 months. Main problem was that is stopped every night - very annoying having to reset this watch each day. The winding mechanism fell out as well, with the result that the entire portion of the watch started to move. By this time I was quite fed up and just threw it out. Probably a reason why this is heavily discounted...."
1,Worked great for a little while...,"I owned this watch for about six months before it stopped working properly. I received many compliments on the watch, and really enjoyed it while it lasted... I will NOT make the mistake of buying another product from Stuhrling, and I think that their warranty terms are ridiculous. So now I have to send $20 with my poorly made watch and hope that the company can fix it or send me another one that will work for six months (hopefully). It's too bad that a watch was meant to do more than look at, otherwise this would be five stars."
4,memory lane,"This is a lovely book. Having worked and lived in DC during the mid 1950s, I particularly liked the sections about Washington. It was fun revisiting old familiar places."
1,Boaring,"This is the first Janet Oke book I've tried and I have to say she's not the writter for me. This was the most boaring book I've ever read. The story is cute but nothing to keep me comeing back, I kept saying ""it will become more exciting soon"" but it never did so half way in I had to stop due to falling asleep. Not for me...."
3,Obnoxious characters ruin book,"I did not care for this book. The lead character is so obnoxious and stuck on himself that he becomes unbearable. And does the author have to tell us how beautiful he is on every page? Maybe it was meant to be satiric, but I just did'nt get it."
3,so-so,"While I know that satires are supposed to use exaggeration as a means of exposing and ridiculing certain ideas and behaviors, this book goes over the top. The multiple points of view don't help, either, as they only succeed in providing a very shallow treatment of the characters. The ending seems rushed, which is a shame, considering it could have served well as a good contrast to the shallow bitchiness of L.A. culture. There are some good moments, yes, but really not enough to override the flaws of what could have been a great book."
3,Sufficiently trashy,"This book is a great summer read. Grab a chair by the pool, lather on the sunblock, take your brain out, and crack the book open. It's totally mindless entertainment and quite a quick read. I thought the climax of the book, the argument between Kevin and Brad, was pretty weakly written, and a few things were left unanswered (Shane's steroid abuse, for example), but all in all it was enjoyable. Quite the satirical look at life in SoCal."
2,"A shallow bit of fluff, but a fun trashy read.","Guinan's first novel is the literary equivalent of limp celery--not much crunch and very little beneficial effect. The characters are terribly predicitble two-dimensional stereotypes, but they are appropriate for the novel's setting. The ending is a blatant attempt to add some gravitas to the work, but has no subtlety and little believibilty. However, it is an easy, fun read that will not require too much effort. The cover, an obvious ploy to attract the novel's target market, will insure that it sells well and will probably cause some anxiety on the beach."
5,I loved this book,"Each page had a laugh and yet I was really drawn into thier lives. The characters are shallow and misguided but to me they also seemed to be a whole lot of fun. I did not want the book to end. In fact, the book made me want to move to LA."
5,A vivid and hilarious depiction of life in post O.J. L.A,"What an exciting, yet curiously moving book. At first you think this venal bunch of characters populating the fringes of glamour Los Angeles are awful but soon they grow on you. A real page turner with gritty detail and insight into the human heart. Overall, a lot of fun."
2,this is a horribly disappointing novel,"I was really looking forward to this novel after having read ""Sex Toys of the Gods"", ""Glamourpuss"", ""Blind Items"" and several other more involving novels in the gay fiction category. The characters in ""California Screaming"" however are obnoxious from the first page. They are extremely shallow and superficial. I could barely get through this novel because I didn't care what happened to them. Not only is every other paragraph about going to the gym but even the characters own thoughts are repetitive. Kevin's continuous reflections on how good he looks were enough to make me nauseated. His character is lazy, unmotivated and has not a single interesting thought. The characters learn nothing in the end and the novel is a complete drag!! There is MUCH BETTER stuff out there!"
3,works great for an fit all,"solid part works good ,like the overall fit ,thing most of the dash mounts that i have bought normal is to have had some mounting bolts or other ,but finish fit is good"
2,Good quality but hard to work with,"I probably would not get this again for a 1994 dodge neon. I had to do extensive cutting to the kit and also to the dash to get it to work. I am not a big fan of cutting off parts of the dash but I was able to make it look good once I was finished. On another note however the actual product I would say was very quality, good solid build. The tray though was utterly useless."
4,It's not here but . . .,it can be had if you surf the internet to the Greg Lake website. That's where I was able to snag this hard to find CD (not tape).It's a pretty good CD and if you're a Greg Lake fan you should be fairly pleased with his solo effort.Not great but pretty good.
4,A Gem for your Bookcase,"The Heart Sutra gets to the heart of human relationships. These stories are about our small 'triumphs and disasters', they are vivid, memorable and honest. The writing is graceful. Well worth a read."
5,Yes you may have a cookie!,"I love level 1 reading books. They are perfect for my 1st grader. There are a few words that are a little challenging, but he's now got the confidence to read on his own!"
1,Leaks Gas Everywhere,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTI unfortunately bought the 1, 2.5 and 5 (three 5 gallon cans) gallon versions of this gas can. If I could rate negative stars, I would. The nozzles are the same for all versions and they ALL LEAK at varying levels, some at a fast drip, some at a steady stream. They seem to leak more gas than fill through the nozzle, for they fill extremely slowly (and of course leak). Stay away from these gas cans. I promise that you'll be disappointed."
1,Piece of plastic garbage,Do NOT buy this gas can. Couldn't get any gas to come out. Spout is unmanageable. A waste of money!!!
5,They work,"These are staple items for emergency kits. These particular light sticks do work. Like another reviewer, mine came without the wrapper, but they did come with some great rubberized ""string"" that is exactly what you need to tie them up and really get good use out of them.I put two in each car's glove compartment, plus four in our emergency bag, and each hiking backpack has one.They arrived quickly, and having the extra string included was much appreciated."
4,"Perfect rice, every time!","I love this rice cooker. I have not used it for the slow-cooker function, but I get perfect rice every time with this baby. The only thing I would change is the ""dew catcher."" It is a very small container with a narrow opening leaving no way to clean it inside. But, it's a minor gripe for such a great machine."
2,Defective Product,"This rice cooker doesnt have any special features or perform better than any rice cookers out there in the market. I brought it just because it looks stainless steel. The product is defective and doesn't sit evenly around. I returned it to Amazon, but be charged on a prepaid shipping label. I would buy from local stores next time. At least I don't have to be charged for all these non-sense charges if I don't like it."
3,good and bad,"For what this does, it's excellent. I mean, two products in one! I love that part of it. However, the lid isn't the best. I had to learn to shut it a certain way, or it didn't 'click' right and it would stop cooking after a few minutes. That can be a bad thing if you've put food in it for slow cooking. Plus, the cup it came with and the spoon were broken and when I contacted the company for a replacement, they said they didn't have anymore. It was basically, OH WELL, sucks for you."
3,"Convenient, but expected more for the price","I really wanted automatic thing like this for rice and other grains. Well, let me first say that it cooks 2 cups of rice for about 20 minutes, then sometimes it does make the rice brown at the bottom and I started just checking rice in 20 min. That's why I don't use the presetting time feature. Other than that, it cleans good and doesn't leave mess anywhere. You just close it tight and turn it off after rice is done.I haven't used the slow cooking feature or steamer either, b/c the purpose of purchase was only to wake up and have the rice ready.So the bottom line is that it's convenient and cooks pretty good rice if you watch it. But for this price it's probably not enough.Also, it's a lot bigger than you can imagine looking at the picture."
4,whew!,"I didn't realize this was so-o-o big! Still figuring out how to get non-sticky rice, but then I was trying to do that via the stove also! I think it will eventually be very useful. Just have to get used to it."
5,Great product,"We got this rice cooker as a gift and didn't really want it at the time...until we tried it. It makes the best rice and steams veggies at the same time, we use it almost daily. We liked it so much that I bought the same one as a wedding gift."
1,Big Disappointment,"We have owned a few quality rice cookers and figured that a rice cooker from Krups would be of good due to their reputation. While most quality rice cookers will keep the rice warm and evenly cooked for a couple of days, this item does not cook the rice evenly as some rice will be burnt and some mushy. The two times we did have evenly cooked rice, the quality had slipped within 10 hours."
3,Not my best choice,"Okay I am not all that into kitchen gadgets that do more than one thing, however, being Krups I thought it would be great, NOT burned the rice ( do know what I am doing) was an awful Slow Cooker. Simply put I gave it to the thrift store after several attempts of trying various things with it."
3,Great play,Great for a college level play. Good story line in order to put on a good show. Pretty easy set.
5,Excellent book that captures the strength of the human spirit!,A must read!Excellent book that captures the strength of the human spirit! Highly recommended as a gift or for yourself!
4,the ED album from firehose,"This is minutemen minus singer/guitar D Boon, who died in a car accident c1985. They got this 'Ed Fromohio' who had no musical background.I interviewed mike watt the next year when flyin the flannel came out. He described this as Ed's album (their neophyte guitarist/singer), while flannel was his/Watt's album.This music makes sense though. Minutemen were fans of CCR and BOC and other unapologetic pop rock from the 70s, and that is what this sounds like. Simple acoustic tinged rock music. This album is not that consistent, but when it hits, it is as good as it gets for minutemen or firehose."
3,Don't *EVER* drop it!,"Frankly, I love this keyboard, and enjoy using it.I think the complaints about the 4-row limitationsare of no real importance in general use(accountants and programmers may disagree!)and find it generally to be a sweet little contraption.My only complaint / concern is its fragility.I'm generally extremely careful about such things,but it slipped from my hand (folded and latched)and fell to the carpeted floor once; it has beenreluctant to close ever since.It still works just fine - it just no longer wants to close,and every time I do so, I wonder if *this* is going to bethe time I break it.I find that very annoying, and my joy in it is dimmed:tools one must fuss over are counter-productive.It's a rough-&-tumble world, and products must berugged enough to survive actual use in the real world;this accident was as mild and moderate as they come,& a productivity tool aimed at busy people on the moveshould provide greater dependability than this."
1,Would be nice if it worked,"What for many people has been an excellent product, for another set, including myself, this keyboard is a disaster. For no apparent reason, this keyboard does not interface properly with a variety of handhelds with the Palm Universal Connector.Affected handhelds include the m515, m505, m500, and m130. The difficulty lies in that it is not possible (or at least it is not generally known) how to tell when it will work or not. When connected, typing produces random characters. Updated drivers, including unreleased internal drivers have not solved the problem. Even a hard reset with the driver as the only installed program has not helped.While this keyboard is certainly more attractive and smaller than its predecessor, the previous version now offers much better compatibility for a lower price."
1,Horrible Keyboard,Here they go trying to jazz up things to the point where they are useless. The KB is unsupported at the ends and thus it annoyingly rocks side to side when typing. The old foldable KB is much better.
5,Must See Film...,"... if you are interested in the history of American Indians, or simply in the story of a people with ancestral traditions struggling to survive the harshness of Nature. This film involves actual Indian actors who were then still living a traditional lifestyle. The introduction by the Indian chief at the beginning is powerful, as he thanks the magic of the camera for preserving forever the story the viewers are about to see, the story of a world that is about to disappear, as he says. I never purchased the DVD because I expected it to have a decent packaging and extras, and maybe a remastering, and I already have The Silent Enemy on Laserdisc. But if you have never seen it, you should purchase the DVD. I will be waiting for a new edition myself. I give it 5 stars, though, because this film cannot be done in the same conditions ever again. It is too late..."
2,overpriced,"The seller must have got a card with some white dust. $799.00 for a dvd is so far out in left field it,s bordering on ridiculous."
2,Well researched but trivial,"I admit that I approached this book hoping for more info about his architecture and scientific thinking. And also admittedly, the author straight off the bat says that if you are looking for pure architecture on Wren look at another book, or pure scientific theories of Wren also look at another book. However, I was hoping for a middle ground. The book delves more into the turbulence of the times and how that affected young Wren's monetary standing. Lots of info about minor characters. Lots of overly long and redundant quotes from archaicly written (obviously) source materials that the author has to paraphrase almost word for word after the quote. But very little info about the science or the architecture."
5,Kristeen where did you go?,This is the only CD I have ever seen by Miss Young although I have heard there are others. I want them if they are out there because this one totally took me by surprise and I have yet to hear anyone else like her. I've heard the words Goth and Industrial associated with her (Goth I can kind of see) but the bottom line is that she writes really good songs and presents them with an intensity that grabs you immediately. I check out Amazon every once in a while to see if any of her other CDs (if they are in fact out there) have become available. In an age of musical fluff and flash Miss Young was true to her muse and created something truly original.
5,Great Charm!,"I bought this link to add to my bracelet. Its detail and clarity on such a small ""canvas"" was awesome. It came in a nice little package that I can use to hold the charms when I switch them out. I love my charm and I have been thoroughly pleased with all of my Pugster Italian charm purchases."
1,A total waste of time.,This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen...Everything is just bad... terrible... pathetic movie
5,ADD A TRAY,THESE WERE JUST THE SAME AS THE ONES I ALREADY HAD FOR MY AMERICAN HARVEST DEHYDRATOR. I BENT ONE IN THE DISHWASHER CAUSE I HAD IT TOO CLOSE TO THE HEATER.
3,Warped& bent,Poor quality found warped & bent not the same materialI baked and re shaped the trays to make them work as I did not have enough time to wait to get them replaced.
1,1 of the sets was warped badly,I ordered 3 sets of these and 1 of the sets was warped badly. Nesco said to send them back to Amazon for a refund. Packing and shipping is more than the $12 I paid for them. At least the other 2 sets were good. Great quality control and attitude Nesco!
5,thanks,was just what we needed.. gave it to my bf as a christmas gift he was soo happy he used it the same day
5,dehydrator,We purchased this unit because of reviews posted. The dehydrator has worked wonderfully. We are sending it to Ghana. If you are looking for a dehydrator this unit is very good. It's features make it a better machine than the others.
2,"Quite, ummm, odd","Whacky but kinda fun movies, although hard to recommend. However, in the extras, there is a kind of travelogue/documentary about the Laplanders and their caribou. The method used by the Lapp women to castrate the caribou is rather, shall we say, tasteless? This four seconds alone is worth the price of the DVD. Watch it with many friends and listen to the howls and groans!"
2,Left me cold,"In the whole corpus of Scandinavian monster movies, these don't rank very high. Obviously, you don't buy these movies unless you love bad cinema. Admittedly I fell asleep so many times during both that I can't write a very detailed review other than to say I've seen many, many better bad movies. (All the skiing and skating made me sleepy I think.) On the plus side, I loved the monster when he finally appeared. And at least they were both pretty short."
3,A Healthier Gumbo,"I absolutely love a nice, hot steaming bowl of soup once in awhile. Fortunately, Healthy Choice makes a nice arrangement of taste and quality with their soups. Their Zesty Gumbo soup however, isn't one of their best flavors. While the soup does blend in a unique blend of chicken, rice celery and flavor, there unfortunately lacks a bit of spice in the flavor by not adding enough garlic or zest from onions or cheese to the taste of the tongue. On top of that, it also lacks by not adding enough sausage in the gumbo, unlike Cambell's Chunky or Progresso's Chicken & Sausage Gumbo. It isn't a bad soup for the price if you're health-smart, but at least it is better than Cambell's putting sea salt in their lower sodium soups. I just hope that there is an improved formula in this gumbo.Price: B-Taste: C+Overall: C+"
3,"yes, no, I don't know","This CD is problematic for me. I don't think it's bad...it has some exciting, professional, arena-ready songs on it...it has the unique Edge guitar...but it doesn't light my fire and compel me to keep playing it the way U2's past albums have, or even the way Kid A does. It seems their head is where Springsteen's was during the Human Touch album...able to write songs in the old style, a few really good songs, but mostly the feeling that there's something missing and it's hard to say quite what - some uninspired lyrics from Mr. Bono maybe? The mental comparisons with masterpieces like The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby? Me being 10 years older and wearier than back then? This seems like a holding pattern while waiting for something new...but anything from U2 is always welcome to me. This may be the type of album that grows on you, so perhaps I'll rate it higher in 6 months."
3,...HAS BONO LOST HIS FAITH...?,"I have been a U2 fan for quite a long time now; but this album just does not inspire me as their previous albums did. They have always been so uplifting, inspirational, encouraging and spiritual...but this album is absolutely one of the most mellow and the least inspiring of any of their previous albums. It is almost depressing in a way, and it really has no ""soul"". Not to be pessimistic, but...Has Bono lost his faith...?"
1,The Forgettable Embers,"well, die hard fans must be pretty hard up. calling this the best album since Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby is absurd. at best, it sounds like U2 put a compilation of ""B"" sides for release. oh, but they did that 2 years ago and it was more satisfying! What happened to the songs that left to wanting more like ""With or Without You"" & ""Where the Streets Have No Name"". What happened to the wail Bono's voice as in ""One"", ""Pride"" or ""ULTRA Violet"". What was always great about U2 was it's ability to be innovators and at the leading edge of progressive music. Even POP was a better album, if only because of it's inventive & exploratory nature.i would imagine Daniel Lanois is wishing he would have better spent his time producing ""Red Dirt Girl"" with Emmy Lou Harris.i feel badly about this harsh review, but i was so let down! i'm a big fan of U2's music, but i was more satisfied with ""Million Dollar Hotel"" than this."
2,Some Stuff U2 Left Behind,"Ahem... I know I other reviewers will give me heck for this review but I have been a fan for a very long time and this is just not all that everyone is cracking it up to be. ""The third masterpiece,"" as Rollingstone magazine claimed it, is way unfounded. True, 'Beautiful Day', 'Grace' and 'When I Look at the World' are good songs and worthy of being on a U2 release. But what the heck has happened to Bono's lyrics? The bubblegum that fills up 'Elevation' and 'Wild Honey' makes me want to stuff my ears. I laugh at myself for saying this but there is just too much Bono on this record.I know it's unfair to say ""I liked them better when they were _______."" but their latest release, depsite its pleasant re-direction in sound, is nothing more than tidy little song structure with little heart and a catchy hook here and there. Heck, Edge encourages us to go download the whole thing. I encourage it too."
1,Cult to mainstream,"U2 enter the 2000, rocking and a rolling but with Bono's stupid long hair. Bono roars vocally through the opening song but the musical backing is unimaginative, to say the least. A power rock reasonably faced paced ballad, if that makes sense. But, without a single inventive guitar line, with absolutely nothing new and also without much of a pop edge, either. Beautiful day is reasonably catchy, but Bono sounds raw.ATYCLB it's just so - commercial. So ordinary in it's commercial intent. They play it safe, everywhere. That's about it. This is a fairly unremarkable album, all told. It lacks direction, generally, there seems to be a general laziness surrounding the album. The lyrics are nothing at all, just mere words that mean nothing - just listen to Elevation - there aren't enough ideas in any of these 11 commercials.I say that. U2 can now be classified as a 'veteran' group"
3,Disappointed,"I'm a huge U2 fan, and own all of their CD's, but I'd held out on purchasing this one. Finally, after hearing how critics loved it, U2 won several Grammy's, and a friend recommended it, I bought the CD. However, I'd have to say except for ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Elevation"", I'm not particularly fond of this album. It's kind of boring and really doesn't take any chances. Perhaps this is what the fans really want, but I'm not one of those fans."
1,Sob! Choke! Sniffle!,"What happened? I've read quite a few reviews that read that U2 has finally plunged into the pop genre. I didn't know too many pop lovers that would say U2 is a good band, that is, until now. All of a sudden...U2 is playing on pop radio stations...and hardly at all on rock or classic rock stations (except for their old tunes of course). For me, I really tried. I REALLY did. It didn't work. I don't even think I can listen to the entire CD all the way through. It's boring, ""popish"", and the lyrics are down right awful. I was surprised with the turnout of this CD, I had been waiting it's arrival intensly. Maybe i expected too much?"
3,"U2... They may be changing, but...","I am a huge an of U2. Acthung Baby is one of the greatest albums ever composed. It is definitely in the top ten of my CD collection. While Zooropa and POP are good albums. I think that ""All that you Can't leave Behind"" isn't their best or their worst. I was a little disappointed, but you can still hear U2's customary sound.I am glad that they didn't lose it! BUt still if you are reading these reviews to decide between this CD and another one, please buy the other CD, unless it is Acthung Baby."
3,pretty good but not the old u2,"i have followed u2 for many years.Bono alone is an adventure.always trying something different.but this album is alright but not very challenging.i really dug beautiful day that was the livest track that they have put out in years.but after that it's business as usual.""New York"" is a tight song as well.but the overall feel of the album doesn't match those songs.it's cool that they have toned down some of there over the top productions.but i miss the old U2 feel."
5,i feel like 18 again,this is one of u2s gratist cds . buy it at all cost if u are u2 fan. if not it will stii turn your craik
1,"No, don't call it a comeback","If you like the latter day U2, then OK, go out, get this CD, and sit with the rest of them and rave about how this is a return to their old glory days. But my favorite U2 album was ""War"", ""The Unforgettable Fire"" was Ok, and from there they completely lost their edge, pun intended. To me, U2 was at their best when they played as angry as anyone in Punk, but were [a lot] more talented. They softened as they got rich, and that will never come back. This is not a return to ""War"". Maybe ""The Joshua Tree"", which although it is regarded as the ""peak"" of U2's musicmanship, I thought it [was bad]."
3,This boy is sad,"I've been a fan of U2 since the early days, but I totally loved the 90's albums, too. I think ""Pop"", despite the negative reviews, was a very powerful album. So, to hear U2 take a step back in creativity and quirkiness is a great disappointment to me. I never dreamed U2 would release such a dull album. I am forcing myself to listen to this release over and over in the hope that I will like more than just half this album. I WANT to like this album. I'm TRYING to like this album. But I don't think it's gonna happen. I have this horrible vision of U2 turning into the Rolling Stones and it saddens me greatly. I mean, if you just looked at the packaging and the credits it would truly be something you'd want to listen to. Eno and Lanois. Man, what happened?"
3,Lots of highs and lows.,"Although there are a handful of catchy U2 classics, the last 4 tracks are quite weak. Recommended: Beautiful Day, Stuck in a Moment, Walk On, Wild Honey. Overall a solid album."
2,the beginning of the end???,"Has ok singles but the rest is sadly poor, and now with their new release being even more bad, I wonder if they'll ever be great again???"
1,All That You Can't Leave Behind,"This album proved to be a true dissapointment. I've been a U2 fan for years and find myself in the minority when I say I've enjoyed their earliest work (Boy, War...) and their latest (from Achtung Baby on) the most. The two albums I never liked (and never bought) were the Unforgetable Fire and Jushua Tree and low and behold they've resurected that preachy, pretentious style. Yeuch! I appreciate Bono's politics but you have to give the listener some good tunes with which to wash it down. What made the later albums so great was their willingness to experiment. Now that's gone and I lament it so."
5,Outstanding!,"WOW! They continue to surprise and generate excellent music at the same time. Having listened to them since the ""October"" days, they just keep getting better. ""Wild Honey"" sounds like an undiscovered Beatles track, and ""New York"" seems to come straight off of Boy or October...am I the only one who hears ""Rejoice"" when Bono sings ""New York""???I woke up this morning and heard ""Elevation"" in my head; this after only hearing the song 1 time.Thanks for the music, U2! I hope you keep make music forever!"
2,You can leave this one behind,"I've been a big fan of U2 since around the time Achtung Baby came out, and this is such a huge step backwards in terms of creativity that it's sad. I loved the more experimental songs on both Zooropa and Pop. Each of those albums had more energy and excitement than this slow and dull ""return to their roots."" How is this a return to their roots? It's so bland that even very early U2 is more enjoyable. It starts out strong with Beautiful Day, but then it loses steam and sputters out after a few songs. Where's the power of Mofo and Please? Where's the soulful singing from songs like Lemon and So Cruel? This album is lacking almost everything that made U2 great. In trying to scale back they cut too much and turned out what is arguably the worst U2 album to date (although none of these songs induces quite the agony that Party Girl does, they are still very poor). Do yourself a favor and pick up any of U2s older albums. This one isn't worth it."
3,why do i keep listening to rolling stone,"This album, though ""well-produced"" and ""solidly written"" is in no way a masterpiece. U2 has not been a ground breaking band since Achtung Baby. One nice thing about this album is that they have backed off of being ""experimental"" (and I use that term loosely) and have decided to focus on anthemic songwriting, their forte. A major problem with this change, however, is that Bono seems to have lost much of his voice. There are a couple of real cringe-inducing moments when he strains for the high notes. While the rest of the album is pleasant enough, don't buy it expecting more than inoffensive radio music. I find it funny that the last three albums have received almost the exact same ratings from most of the major music reviewers. It's almost as if U2 is incapable of releasing anything but 4 star, 85/100 albums. Listen to the new Radiohead album, and then this one, and tell me that they are even in the same league with each other (with a straight face)."
3,Just blah,"Sounds just ok to me on a first listen. Insipid lyrics, Wallflower-esque sounds ('Stuck in a Moment'). Disappointed so far, but I'll give it a couple more chances before I shelve it."
1,One Courtesy Star For the Memories...,"I'll keep this short and simple. I'm a big U2 fan and this c.d. was absolutely terrible! It represented a recurring theme in a music - one which few bands pull off well: the attempt to mix a cocktail of trendy, tried and true. The songs are poppy and senseless and are lukewarm at best when compared to such genius as ""War"" and ""The Joshua Tree.""""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" is a heartless heap of commercialism and a failed attempt to pander to the next generation of consumers. ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" should have been left behind...along with Madonna's ""Music"" and whatever nonsense former greats will undoubtedly ruin themselves with. It's a sad day when U2 sells their soul - but alas, this day has come."
2,Only good thing about the record is Peter Gabriel's chorus!,"As a long timer fan of U2, I feel deceptionated about this record as well as the previous two ones. Bono's voice is weak, Edge shows none of his magical cords in the record resulting in just another music experiment. If you're trying to progress into music I recommend picking new alternative groups rather than hear U2 doing it.I think that for big stars it's hard to call it quits on the top, and for U2 well, Joshua Tree was it."
2,Confused In Chicago,"This is my second review because I'm not sure that I understand all the hoopla and 5 star ratings. I find it hard to believe that the people giving it 5 stars will be listening to this a few months from now. The beautiful thing about Joshua Tree, Unforgettable Fire, and to some degree Achtung Baby, is that they still provide listening enjoyment to this day. I've really tried to give this album a chance but I find that the lack of rhythm and tempo changes has me consistently daydreaming instead of listening. Spend your money more wisely."
5,U2 keeps me gueesing,"Well, they have done it again. Maybe you didn't fall in love with Zooropa (I did), Pop (I did) - but this one you gotta love if you have any bit of soul... The second time I heard the cd I was laughing on how different and unbelievable every track was.. Kinda like how all their cd's are much different... U2 is like someone your attracted to but can never figure out what they are all about... Keep me gueesing cause this one will go down in History."
1,Terrible- - what happened U2?,I really enjoyed the first two tracks off this CD until it went on and it went downhill for me from there... I'm sorry-but this music is less than mediocre. Great for the masses and the New Yorkians who buy this cra*. I'm really dissapointed in these guys. They used to put out quality music and this is definitely nothing new to the world of music. He could have done a much better job singing too.. but even the quality of the recording is terrible. His voice sounds scratchy and believe me that is not from his off key style. It comes from not caring about the music--period. Give it 5 stars-- it's exactly what MTV would love to rave about. I sold this one right away- I would give it away if I had to.
2,Leave it behind!,"Boring, insipid, banal, uninteresting, lifeless, dull, flat, fatuous, tedious, trite, trivial, hackneyed, ordinary, unremarkable, bald, inane, jejune, vapid, commonplace, empty, vain, unavailing, useless, ostentatious, superficial, obvious, predictable, futile, weak, fake, unoriginal, tired, passionless, monotonous, worthless, tasteless, apathetic, sluggish, indifferent, awkward, wretched, untalented, primitive, pointless, u2less... worst U2 album ever."
3,Yawn,"Not bad, but dull. Musically, it reminds me of a more modern version of John Lennon's late works--dreamy and soft--but without the interesting lyrics. Except that John Lennon did it 25 years earlier."
1,Not the U2 I came to enjoy,"Only one word can describe this album after a listen: vapid. It's lifeless. Nothing draws me in, and with maybe one or two exceptions, nothing makes my feet tap. It simply doesn't move me -- and yes, i really like U2."
2,Too old to rock n roll,"These guys too old to make a differance now. Pass this one by and dig the new breed: Grandaddy, Flaming Lips, Coldplay, Badly Drawn Boy and RADIOHEAD. U2 are just trend hopers who've had their time in the sun. Anyone hoping for U2 to be the saviours of rock is dreaming - U2 have now entered Rolling Stones teritory. Retire now and save some of your dignity - not that Bono has ever had any of that."
1,I used to like U2,"I'm giving this 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' cd one star because I don't like how the lead singer of U2 wears sunglasses all the time, even when he's inside. I think that's silly. He's very fashionable, I guess, but being fashionable is silly. And the other guy in the band, I believe he's the guitar player, I don't like either, because he's always wearing the same hat on his head, even when it's not cold out -- again, just to be fashionable.I do like their music though. The cd's pretty good. it's just hard to enjoy the music when you think the band's a joke.If I was just rating this cd's music and not the silly appearance of the band, I'd probably give it 3 stars."
2,i left it behind,"so i bought this album after hearing all this pre-grammy hype. i brought it over to my friends apartment, listened to it once and that was it. when i packed my stuff to go, this album was ironically the only thing i left behind in his apartment."
2,Gooey Pap,"This is not the U2 that I know - I'm a fan from way back but this is way too mellow and similar to make any new inroads. If some unknown band had released this it would have tanked at the gate. Yes, I've listened many times but it puts me to sleep. Songs one and three rock a bit, but be sure to get your ""jammies"" on before listening 'cause it's sleepy time! I should have listened to this before I bought it, but it was used and I made a quick decision. By the way, the ""bonus"" disc track is nothing special and should have been put on the full-length version."
3,Really all that you CAN leave behind,"Please don't be fooled by the tons of Grammys this album has received. The album is overhyped and overrated. The reason why it's so heralded by music critics is because it returns Bono and his mates to their stripped-down former rock roots. After venturing into the slightly alternative and truly acclaimed Zooropa and Pop where U2 saw sales suffer, they decided to return to their original sound, the sound that won millions over. Honetsly to me, there sounded musch better during the 1st three albums of the 90's.While not terribly a bad LP, it certainly does not break any new grounds, but rather pays lotsa homeage to their good old 80's sound when Joshua Tree sold bucketloads. Bono sounds the same. The whole sound is the same. And thanks to that blind obsession over the LP, many worthy artists such as India.Arie has been sadly and ruthlessly overlooked.If there's any album you can leave behind, this is one."
2,what happened to this band?,"This album is really bad. I think u2 needs to hang it up before they sink deeper in pop quick sand. The joshua tree was great compeling album. The songs had drive, heart and were emotional. They demanded your attention from start to finish. U2's latest album is nothing more then the same old bland pop music. Why? U2 was a band that I looked up to and found as role modles. They had an album called POP of heavens sake!!! I sorry but if you've been a U2 fan and remember the old days you should understand were I'm coming from. U2 is nothing more then a well oiled gear in the MTV robot. Get War or joshua tree for real U2. Look away and keep walking on this one. You'll be happy that you did"
4,Thank God for this album,"I've fallen in and out of love with U2 quite a bit over the past 10+ years. After a few horrific albums I have to thank God for this work. Definitely returning to a sound that seems to be very comfortable for both the Edge and Bono, I can't say that I remember a venture from them in recent years that matches this quality. I would recommend this with Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree any day."
2,"This one should have been called ""POP""","I guess U2 can get away with throwing together and sewing up songs like ""Walk On."" But to me U2 always meant energy, not song after song of boring pop. Their last CD had a few problems, but also real guts in places. In the last part of POP, the creativity and energy died, and it carries to this CD (though Beautiful Day is nice enough). At least try to listen through the CD before buying."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OUT THERE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST CONCERT DVDS EVER,"The set list is well chosen, the musicians play very well, it feels and sound like all is REALLY live and the video definition is clear, top notch.They took a big risk with the gothic look of the concert (could have made all the show look grainy, pixelated and unwatchable), but the masterful use of lights prevent chaos from happening, and provides us fans of Evergrey with one good looking concert DVD.The extras are HUGE and welcomed, but how many drunk antics could you endure from behind the scenes? Sometimes i feel the band crossed the line between showing that they are down to earth kind of guys to make themselves seem just moronic, idiotic people.But if that is the only negative thing, you know that this package is masterful anyways.Highly Recommended."
5,AWESOME!!,"I gave the missile system as a gift for a 6 year old, and I couldn't believe how much fun it was for kids and adults! It is not waterproof, and the missiles can shoot so high that you need to watch out for rooftops. It is an awesome toy and tons of safe fun!"
4,Good!,"Well it is a nice concert, it is not the level of Sir Bob but I liked it, especially Duppy Conqueror and Fussin' and Fightin'."
1,1 star due to 'regulations',"I can't watch video on demand because I'm not located 'in the US' I'm on a US base, but can't watch VOD - I""M NOT HAPPY !!"
3,Fun but not like the original,I wanted to like this show because I really liked the original show. Unfortunately the new show is nothing like the original. The names are the same but that is all. The show does some really silly things that completely destroy any hope for credibility. Like having KITT transform from a car to a truck. Really?
4,cool high tech show for the time,Knight Rider was cool back in the day. a talking car&it was very state of the art for it's time period. one of those ries you wanted to have&you always enjoyed each early episode. the show though stayed solid for a few years before the novelty wore off but during it's early run it was a cool show.
5,"The Lone Ranger of the 80's, reborn.","In the 80's, it was a cutting edge series I never missed. Too bad it's didn't make the cut for rebirth. However, The new K.I.T.T. was not a disappointment. Val Kilmer as K.I.T.T. was a great addition. The special effects were great, and the new Michael Knight...Justin Bruening is Michael Knight...I think the failure was in the script plots needed to be edgier. Don't eliminate movies in the future..."
5,Big Bang for your money,"I never watched the show during its original run. My wife watched it and turned me on to it. We purchased the second season first (good) and I decided to start off at the beginning. This particular collection is good, as it sets the stage, explaining who Michael Knight is, what the ""Foundation"" is, where that ominous voice comes from during the opening credits, etc. As an extra bonus, this collection includes the entire ""Knight Rider 2000: The Movie Sequel."" While I enjoyed it, nothing beats the original t-top. A must purchase for fans of the show."
5,One of the best d20 titles just got better,"The original Experts, released several years ago, was one of the most useful d20 supplements ever produced. It was a powerful DM tool for populating his world with vibrant, three-dimensional NPCs who truly had an impact in their culture. Many players began adopting Expert characters for the games as a result of the new details within the book and the unique challenge of playing an Expert PC amidst an adventuring party. I just recieved my copy of Experts 3.5 last week, hot off the press. The material has been updated to version 3.5 and about 60 pages of new material has been added. The book is a delight and it is probably the best looking d20 supplement I've seen in awhile with great cover and interior artwork. This book is a must for all d20 players and owners the first edition of Experts will love the expanded and updated material. Top notch work from Skirmisher!"
4,"classic, still fun","I know that this game is old, outdated, and graphically lacking, but this doesnt take away from how fun this game is. With a customizable character, and the abiltiy to kill about anyone you want makes this game a winner despite its age. Its easy to see how it won game of the year."
3,Does a decent job under the right conditions.,"I live in Texas and we have brutally HOT summers here. The first attempt with the tool was at 95+ degrees and it wasn't very effective, the glue just would not hold.So I tried again some weeks later, after it cooled off a little, approx 85-90 degrees and it did much better! It really only pulls about 80% of the dent out, but it makes it much less noticeable. You can try on the same dent multiple times and sometimes you get a better result each time, sometimes not. It really depends on the angle and the metal.I did find that the small puller really didn't work well at all because the glue doesn't have enough surface area to work with on the puller. The larger puller does work and turned my baseball-sized dents (those Texas storms) to dime-sized. Only on a few dents did it actually pull to the surface.My biggest complaint is that the kit only comes with 2 puller sizes and there should be a greater variety.Overall, it does a decent job for the price."
4,Worth the price!,"This tool won't restore your car body to perfection, but it goes 95% of the way. I used it to pull three quite visible dents ranging in diameter from quarter- to silver dollar-sized. After the repair, all that remained were small dimples that you would not notice unless you looked right at them. I'm quite pleased. This tool saved me a lot of money!"
2,Jennings was a lousy soldier!,"While the book is relatively well written, it is obvious to anyone who has ever served in ANY modern military organization that Christian Jennings would have failed (and did) in any military endeavor made. He failed in the Brit Paras (no surprise) and failed in the Legion (even less surprise). Having served two years in the USMC and another 23 years in the US Army, I can honestly say that Jennings behavior would have gotten him thrown out of the USMC and the US Army. This admitted deserter deserves little credence, his opinions colored by his own failures."
3,A Fun Read. Not More,"Zelazny has written an intriguing Sci-Fi/detective story.But dont expect too much. It will not blow your mind off.The characters are flat and quite indistinguishable.The plot itself is thin.The ""In medias res"" technique is annoying after a few chapters.The bottom line - Read it and forget it."
5,Excellent quality appliance ... My new love!,I have had mine now for a couple of months and it has gotten a great deal of use. I find that it cooks evenly every time (if I could only master getting the exact right amount of batter in it that would be a coup!) and it heats up by the time I have my batter made. It is a nice heavy stainless steel construction and very well made.The plates came off easily for cleaning (love that feature!) and were easy to clean. I also appreciate that the tray on the bottom is easily removed for cleaning. I think it was ingenious to not have it connected to the unit. It has slots which allow it to sit well and stay put on the base until you want to slide it out for cleaning.I chose this particular unit not only for its great reviews but because I like the rectangular waffle shape more than the round shape of other units. All in all I absolutely could not be more pleased with this Krups Waffle Maker!
1,Disappointing waffles,"After seeing all the good reviews, I ordered this waffle iron. My old Vitantonio waffle iron finally broke after 10+ years. With the Krups, the waffles came out uneven. One half was perfectly crispy and golden brown, the other half was pale. Maybe this machine is defective? Also, my old waffles were soft on the inside and crisy on the outside. With this one, the side that was crispy, was dry on the inside. Disapointing."
5,5 star waffle iron,This is the best waffle iron someone can own. I spray with pam after the iron is hot then add the batter and 4 minutes later they are ready. There isn't a beep to let you know they are ready but a timer works fine. I love being able to take out the plates to clean them. Every time I serve waffles to people they are really impressed. I love adding chopped pecans to the batter. Also I use the heart healthy bisquick mix and they are light and fluffy inside and crisp outside. A definite 5 star item indeed!!!
5,Love this cable,I bought this cable to use with my small tube amp and my ES-135. It is extremely well built and sounds fantastic. I have since built a pedalboard and the right angle works perfectly for the last output to my amp. I definitely noticed a bit of a boost in sound.Absolutely recommended
1,No music just interviews,"I bought this to hear Chet Akins, who recently passed away, play some of his great guitar music. As interview after interview went on I kept thinking that at any moment they would show him at a concert or at a studio playing his guitar. Well whenever he did start to play they overlayed more interviews about how great Chet was. Well he was great I just wanted to hear him prove it once again. A real disappointment."
2,Not much pickin',"This is NOT a music DVD. I guess the package doesn't actually SAY that ""Chet"" is playing with all the prople listed, but I guess I assumed as much. This is a documentary. It shows Mr. Atkins as a strong influence over the music industry and many individuals. I found it informative, however now that I have purchased this disk, I don't know what to do with it. It is not something I feel I will want to see again in the next twenty years or so. There is only so many times I can hear about how ""Chet"" made Elvis what he was. Most of my music disks I can watch over and over, just like regular audio disks. Not this one. Hey, anybody want to buy a good DVD?"
3,Thought it was celtic rock.,"Just a very loud and hard rock, no jamming fiddle solo's and such. If you want celtic rock don't buy this, if you want loud hard rock which is indistinguishable from anything you could hear on todays junky radio stations this is it."
3,Good but flawed,"This is an interesting book. The essential info about each edition of the world cup is there and is aptly summarised by the author. My main criticism is about the overall tone of the book. Mr. Glanville writes in a judgemental, self-righteous manner that becomes irritating after a couple of chapters. He's quick to judge and criticize, to the point when I kept wondering why he bothered to write the book in the first place. If you can get pass this major flaw, it's worth your time and money. I would have preferred, though, if Mr. Glanville had refrained from inflicting his very moralistic opinions on the reader."
4,My Opnion,"The weight, balance and quality of this set is outstanding and what one would expect from wallace silversmith. If I were looking for a flaw it would be that the dinner fork and soup spoon are oversized."
3,Not happy with quality,"I ordered these to supplement a set I had bought years ago. These looked as though they were exactly the same but actually are inferior. Though each implement is slightly larger than my originals, the newer pieces actually weighed less and also felt lighter. What was a nicely raised area down the middle of the handles before is now flat. The beads are very small now, not as well defined and not continued on the undersides of the pieces as previously.They *are* shiny but other than that look cheap to me. Disappointed."
3,"Cute, Trite, quick read","The best part of the book was that it was a fast read. Overall the main character was likeable, and that is the only character that you get to know to any depth. The story is coming from a chubby girl who is sister to a ""real warlock"" (as the book puts it) who was adopted. The chubby little girl gets introduced to a witch with her mom and becomes skinny and beautiful and is able to do magick because this witch gives her power. Then she saves the day and falls in love and then the witch takes her power away but she still has her man and her beauty.This is just a romance, if you like to lose yourself without having to worry about reality... take the plunge in this young adult book. If you want something that will actually have some depth and magick and romance then I would suggest many other books... for young adult I would suggest the SWEEP series, or the Circle of Three series."
4,The best book,You'll never want to put this book down. You will jump out of your seat with exitment. When you finish it you will be crying that you finished the book because you will not want to leave the characters.
3,Froggy Chocolate,"Chocolate Frogs taste just like CRUNCH's chocolate only slightly lighter. I was suprised that they id include a wizard's card like regular chocolate frogs in the wizarding world. But mine I would say where a little high priced for something so small. So if you're someone rich try a chocolate frog, they have variety."
3,SWEAR THAT YOU WILL CHANGE THAT HAIR!,"Sheena Easton was never a concept album girl!, she was more a singles artist!, ""but"", if there was a highlight album in her career, ""Private Heaven"" was it!, this has to be Sheena's funky-pop album that could stood in the test of time. Was the only one to include two top 10 hits, ""Sugar Walls"" so sugestive, ""Strut"" so funky and pop!, sadly the anoying funky gem ""Swear"" broke the hit stride, this remastered version features remixes of the hits, what better to encourage people to rebuy this stuff. Sheena's funny faces in her ""Sugar Walls"" videos were outstanding you didn't know if you were sensually insinuated or wanted to laugh really hard!, her yellow earings, who hoo! well it was the 80's, in a conclution beside the awful cover photo of the album, this has to be the most succesful album of Miss Easton, and if someones tries to tell me that her debut was way better, I believe that her debut was crowed by of key fillers."
4,Tom Sawyer graphic novel,"This edition is a graphic novelization of the Mark Twain classic ""Tom Sawyer"". From the series of ""Now Age"" books, it incorporates drawings to illustrate the text to make the book more accessible for some readers.The text is abridged to make it a more manageable length for illustration. Where possible I believe readers should be encouraged to go for the original, unedited version."
1,Don't Bother!,"I bought this book for my grandson's graduation and was disappointed. This is not a proper guide for the graduate. Instead it rambles on with cliches in lieu of any practical advice. This book is not researched. Rather, it is one person's very skewed experiences after college."
1,Piece of junk!,"Wow I've never been so disappointed in a Motorola product. I had an HS820 that was hard ot hear from but otherwise great. I broke that, got this, and the quality is garbage! The earpiece is stiff, the sound is 'staticy', and it's 3g heavier. Looks great - performs awful!Buyer beware!"
2,ok but flawed,"I agree with some of the comments about the unit switching itself on when the case is closed. This is simply ridiculous. If the case is in a bag and something presses on it, the date book or address book button will switch the palm on and there goes your battery without you noticing it. It's happened twice in the last month and it happens even if you don't have anything in the credit card sleeves on the left hand side cover. I used to have a case for my 500 that closed all the way with a zipper (better protection) and never ran into that problem. Otherwise this case is ok."
5,Tarot,"After purchasing several Tarot Decks, I have found the Robin Wood deck the best, The images on the cards are easy to understand as well as the symbols. This Book is a must it really helps to understand the symbols."
5,Book is a deck must have!,"If you own the Robin Wood Tarot Deck, you MUST HAVE this book! It is beautifully written! I had picked her tarot deck as my ""choice deck,"" because the artwork is so appealing. However, I did not fully understand why it appealed to me until I got the book. Ms. Wood's explanations of why she drew the cards the way she did, touched me deeply, especially her description of the Heirophant."
3,"Sensual, Erotic Fun","A name comes to mind when I read into this book. Marquis de Sade. But Robert Rootes isn't as outright as the Marquis. Robert is more refined, less vulgar. Still I think there is the touch of sexuality within the twisting romances. I wasn't sure if he was writing a romance or an erotic vampire horror novel. There is a lot of stuff like Laurell K. Hamilton in it, but there are a lot of things that are original too. I love the way these beings take the soul and not blood. But the vampires are there too. It's an interesting mix and makes it a great read. So why three stars? I think the type setting is a little off. But that's not his fault. If you can overlook that and get into the story I think you will love it. Give it a look."
5,Suspenseful!,"In this thriller from master story-teller Lois Duncan, Kitpasses a test, enabling her to enter a boarding school calledBlackwood. However, why are there only 4 other girls at Blackwood? Kit soon finds out the truth about what the girls have in common, and why they're really at Blackwood...Unique and chilling, this page-turner will have you begging for more!"
1,Lois !!! What Happened !!!????,"I don't understand how someone can go from writing such a good book like 'Stranger With My Face' to this..... I couldn't even get to the middle of the book !! I tried really hard. It was painful, and so I had to let it go, and any glimmer of hope I had for a decent book based on customer reviews. Skip it !!!"
5,Its simply stunning!,This game is visually explosive. It has all the makings of one of the best games for PSX2. The vehicles are just awesome. This is a most have game.
1,Boring Boring Racing,It was a bore back then and is still a bore now. Almost any other racing game will entertain more than this.
1,Tokyo Streets,"I thought this was going to be a documentary about Tokyo Streets, however it just short 3 to 5 minute clips of various parts of Tokyo and street performers. There is no narration, just footage."
1,DO NOT BUY,The software is outdated and they wouldnt even work on my computer that has windows xp. DO NOT BUY
3,Jury is still out,"Bought this so I could see my great nephew grow up in Ontario,I am in Vermont.It is fun, fairly easy to use.Not the quality I expected but then I have never owned anything like it. There is laso an annoying feedback type sound that willnot go away when conncected for a video conversation. Sounds like birds. My parakeets love it and go nuts. I could do without it. It does however keep me in touch with my sister, her daughter and son as well as my most adorable great nephew.For $60 it is fine."
4,buddycam review,"I was very happy with this product. I use it with msn messenger and it works very well. I talk to my friend across the country almost everyday. The picture is clear and we can talk to teach other as if we were on the phone, just make sure you have your settings right. I recommend this product."
2,Meh...,"Sub standard video, even worse audio. Not a good webcam at all. I got these for my parents to use and even when I went to their house and set it up manually for them they worked intermittently. Many better webcams out there. Keep looking and skip over these.Thanks for reading my review."
4,Must Read Book For Anyone Interested in Gould's Philosophies,"I think the best way to look at this book is as a book by Gould filtered through the mind of a professional philosopher. Read Friedrich's book for an example of the influence that Gould had on how this book was written. Although this might detract from this book as an objective analysis of Gould's thought (I got the same sense reading the book that I do when listening to or reading a transcript of one of Gould's famous scripted ""off-the-cuff"" interviews), it is still very important as a compendium of his ideas, articulated in a coherent framework. Especially interesting is Gould's denunciation of much of the Romantic piano literature, and his admission (gasp) that he would occasionally play Chopin for himself at home. (and,yes, I am aware of the recording of the B minor sonata.) If you are interested in Gould or modern thought on music and the relationship of media to music, buy this book."
1,BORINGGGGGGG,"What a waste of a nice evening! This movie was beyond horrible and if I could have given this movie -stars I would have. The plot was borning, nothing made me think in this movie because quite frankly there was nothing to think about. I read some reviews on here before I even rented it and I have to agree with the people that say its dull, boring and most of all a waste of time. Nothing about this movie was scary, if you want to see something better, watch ""The Ring"". Please do yourself a favor and when you see this movie in the movie rental stores, do not even give it the pleasure of your glance."
1,Let's not see another Last House on the Left and see another,"THEY! This is probably the worst horror movie ever. Not scary, not funny, not entertaining, there is just nothing to like here, so don't waste your time seeing it."
2,"'They' had me at hello, but lost me well before the goodbye.","""They"" starts out with a brilliant scene introducing the 'night terrors' that disturb a little boy. The scene was creepy and very well done. Soon after, though, it all went downhill. Don't be fooled by the ""Wes Craven presents.."", he had nothing to do with the direction of this film. And it shows. The plotline and premise quickly fall apart and the ending leaves you wondering why you wasted your time. This movie is one of those that was totally butchered. If you're a die hard horror fan, like myself, rent it just to see it. But don't expect anything too spectacular."
1,The worst horror movie since Wishmaster,"This movie is summed up by the old saying ""Much ado about nothing"". You can tell they had a great special effects team but it is always so dark that you never get to see anything. The monster never comes into the light. It appears for about 1 1/2 seconds each time it springs out and never delivers even to the very end. The only thing good about THEY is the alternate ending but by then you're so bored it doesn't even save it. Remember movies like: THE THING, ALIEN, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET? Those were good scary movies. Don't waste your time or your money on this one. I've seen scarier episodes of Sponge Bob Square Pants!"
3,"""They"" come for you in the dark.....","I didn't really like watching this one. It seemed that the casting was way off(I would've used the main character from ""May"")and the script is filled with useless dialogue. A lot of the lines do nothing to further the story or define the characters. The overall feel of the movie was dull and un-interesting. It was a pretty big let-down. For movies of the same genre, see ""Boogeyman"", or ""Alone in the Dark""(both of which have the same premise, but both are more fun to watch).If you enjoy Wes Craven's work, watch this and form your own opinion, but you might want to pass this up."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,This movie has 0 scary scenes and is incredibly boring. I can't believe Wes Craven would lend his name to this tripe!
3,They...your typical horror film.,"Wes Craven's ""They"" is your typical horror film, focusing on the night-terrors that haunt the main character. Julia, is a psychology student, who witnesses her good friend go crazy from his nightmares. He eventually kills himself to avoid his nightmares, but this brings back all of her fears. She and couple of friends, all share nightmares and night terrors and are haunted by their fears. It is never made clear exactly what they are fearing or what is after them.The movie is your typical stock horror film with so-so acting, mediocre plot and a bad ending. The good thing about the DVD is that it features an alternate ending (though just as bad). ""They"" is good for horror fans but there is nothing surprising in its story."
1,Big mistake,"This watch is much better at the picture then the reality, and I recommend you don't swim with it.I bought this watch thinking that I was making a great purchase.One day, when I was at Rio de Janeiro beach, I decided to swim a little. Later, I realized that some water get inside the watch. Some weeks later, the watch was totally rusty and stop working."
5,An Effort to Differentiate Aspects of Reviews,"This series/DVD got two and a half stars. This was based on only the two reviews there were. One review, pretty much reviewed the series, and gave it four stars out of five. The other review gave only one star -- but it was all based on complaints with Amazon's description vs. what they seem to have received in the mail: ""The item shipped was not as shown. The description stated 14 1/2 hours on three DVDs. I was sent 2 DVDs with 172 minutes.""I think -- perhaps -- just something to think about -- there should be ways to separate comments. For instance, the actual film/TV series/whathaveyou; the production of it onto the DVD or whathaveyou; Amazon's description matching the received product; et al..."
5,Wonderful!,"I first saw this when I was in England many years ago. It was funny, and in many episodes, the truth hit home. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the whole series. Until now. Thank you!!"
2,I really tried to like this CD,"I'm sorry, I really tried to like this album but it comes up short on all counts. The lyrics are bland, and the music doesn't even sound like contemporary country (it's pure pop, and even a little rap). Leann has an awesome voice, but I think she tried to stretch her talents too far with this effort. The only positive part of this CD is the song ""Life Goes On."""
4,a pleasant surprise,"more ""pop like"" than I would have imagined, but very good. The first 4-5 songs are the best. Worth the [money]."
1,dissapointing,"I was very dissapointed with this album.LeAnn is a very talented young woman with great potential ,and a beautiful voice,but this album doesn't cut it.I expected some originality,and artistic growth,but instead LeAnn is just following trends.She has some wannabe r n'b songs(tic toc,trouble with goodbye),lots of catchy radio aimed material.Bland ballads,and a lot of wannabe whitney vocals here and there,and everywhere.I'm sorry,but none of these songs suit her voice,and there isn't much emotional involvement between her vocals and the song.If LeAnn keeps subjecting herself to trends,then,sadly,her career will not last long.She needs to find her own ground,vocally,and musically.I found everything to be overproduced as well.The only good songs were ""Love is An Army"",and ""Damn"", which wasexactly what I was thinking when I had finished listening to this record."
4,Apocalypse NOW!,"As definitive a single song as ""Stairway to Heaven"" was for Led Zeppelin, ""Eight Miles High"" flies so close to the sun, Bob Mould can't even make his mouth properly form the words at the halcyonic climax. ""Love Is All Around"" (aka the Mary Tyler Moore song) is equally definitive as the Minneapolis National Anthem (amazing the Replacements didn't think of covering it first, although Joan Jett had no qualms about borrowing the idea a few years later). Pity they didn't include their NME flexi-disk live version of ""Ticket To Ride,"" as the Beatles were the Huskers' true precedent, Grant Hart playing soppy McCartney to Mould's malevolent Lennon, rounded out by Greg Norton's happy-to-be-here Ringo stardom, but I suppose they're saving that for the waaaay overdue 2-CD retrospective (cross your fingers for a supporting tour)."
4,"essential, but....","This is essential to any Husker Du collection. ""Eight Miles High"" should have been included with their immortal ""Zen Arcade"" album - it paints clearly how Hart & Mould drew upon old-school psychedlia to create new sounds.However, if you can, find the vinyl 45. The CD was abysmally mastered (which is why I dock it a star), and sounds as if it were recorded at the bottom of a fish bowl. The 45 (which has ""Eight Miles High"" b/w ""Masochism World"" captures the real sonic intensity of the recordings. The CD is readily available, but an aural dissapointment."
3,Two great covers at one abysmal price!,"Pop Kulcher Review: ""Eight Miles High"" and ""Love is All Around"" (aka the theme from the Mary Tyler Moore Show) are two of the most wonderful, joyous covers ever recorded. Sad, then, that SST is out to rook the public by putting 'em on an overpriced cd-single (""Makes No Sense at All"" is already available on the Flip Your Wig cd, which most Husker Du fans presumably already own). Would it have been so terrible to tack these songs onto the end of New Day Rising or Flip Your Wig?"
4,Walking around with your head in the clouds.,"This CD features the a-sides and b-sides of two Hüsker Dü singles. ""Eight Miles High"" is a good cover version of the classic Byrds song. ""Masochism World"" is a poorly recorded live version of a song from Hüsker Dü'sthird album. ""Make No Sense at All"" is a great original song by the group. ""Love is All Around"" is a good version ofThe Mary Tyler Moore Showtheme song, which could have been great if the group had learned the second verse, instead of just repeating the first verse."
4,Another solid Blu ray,Great Picture and Excellent if you like the band you will enjoy this if your a new comer buy for the quality of this disc you will not be disappointed
1,This is one messed up HD-DVD,I could not get this disc to work right on either of my HD-DVD players. It won't allow access to menues and it is extremely slow to respond. I have a lot of HD-DVDs and this is the only one I regret buying.
4,Worth it for Stannard,"This is a fine collection taken as a whole, but the standout essay is certainly David Stannard's ""Uniqueness as Denial."" Indeed, it is one of the finest and bravest essays I have ever read, although absolutely merciless in its polemic against ""uniqueness"" theories."
5,Wow!,"What an album! I've seen Salonen conduct a few times, but this is the first time I've heard one of his own compositions. Amazingly different, combining modernism, minimalism, and melody all at the same time. He's also wonderful at using unique sounds. During LA Variations, there were a few times where I wasn't sure what instrument was playing. And during the Sappho piece, Salonen feels free to use drums that sound almost like bongos. I just can't wait for his next composition..."
5,Esa-Pekka Salonen: a great conductor...and a great composer,"Wait a minute...isn't he just a conductor? No, this Finnish-born conductor is also a composer. This CD is his first release and it contains 5 world premiere recordings. Salonen has always been a promoter of new music and now he shows us what he can do. The three orchestral works are diverse and show off the ability of the ensemble he conducts full time. Dawn Upshaw, soprano, and Anssi Karttunen, cello, grace this CD as featured soloists on two of the pieces. Dawn Upshaw sings beautifully on Salonen's ""Five Images After Sappho."" The Ojai Festival and the London Sinfonietta commissioned this work. Anssi Karttunen, for whom this work was composed, performs ""Mania"" for violoncello solo and ensemble.This CD is a great companion to the (also) Finnish-born composer Kaija Saariaho's recording of Graal Theatre, Chateau De L'ame, and Amers."
2,Missing the book jacket,"The book is in good shape. It arrived promptly. However, I expected from the photo that it would have the book jacket. It does not. I am disappointed because it is a gift. The photo should have shown the actual brown hardcover. Or clearly stated that it was missing the picture/jacket."
1,Not what I expected....,"I decided to get this book because I like Collies, I have a Collie, and I like reading stories about Collies (e.g., Albert Payson Terhune's books about Lad, Bruce, etc.). There is no synopsis of the story listed under the product information of the edition that I purchased. I saw just now, in searching other editions for this review, that there IS a synopsis -- which would have precluded my further interest in getting this book. AMAZON, you do your potential buyers a disservice in not letting us know about the content of EACH edition. Unfortunately for me, this book has a Christian preaching bent to it, ""saving Gordon (the boy),"" with the dog, Twig, as an incidental. Granted, I've only read the first few chapters, but as I have no interest in Christianity or being preached to (been there, done that, found something much, much better), I will immediately consign this book to my ""giveaway"" pile. So, buyer beware...."
2,This film had nothing to lose!!,"Black and white Alpha video. Hester Engle (Evelyn Brent) is accused of murder and is being framed. Ex-policeman/detective Duke Martindale (Neil Hamilton) and his sleuth wife Phyllis (June Storey), whom just happened to be attorney, believe that someone in the police force is doing the framing. Meanwhile his nemesis in the force, Police Sergeant Brent (Douglas Fowley) thinks that duke is responsible for a murderer and covering up for Hester.Unfortunately, this movie is mediocre in many ways.See June Storey again, in ""The Lone Wolf Takes a Chance"" (1941) which is part of the Lone Wolf series of movies."
5,GREAT,"THANK YOU FOR PROMPT DELIVERY OF A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. PRICE, PACKAGING AND ITEM VERY EXCEPTABLE."
5,Literate lyrics and great music,"I bought this CD last night after seeing McMurtry do an instore performance in Houston - he was great live. McMurtry has been making well-written rocking music for a long time. Like other good singer-songwriters who may not sell a ton of stuff, but have a fiercely loyal following, McMurtry always articulates what a lot of us are feeling. Highlights are ""Restless,"" ""Charlemagne's Home Town,"" and ""We Can't Make it Here."" It's all good though. Buy it!"
4,Can't Make It Here,"James McMurtry comes out flying in this almost cynical collection that includes ""Childish Things"" and ""We Can't Make It Here"". After being a virtually undiscovered treasure of the Austin music scene for many, many years McMurtry's phrasings and thoughts are among the best lyrics this year.Although they are very different, I see parallels with Emmylou Harris ""Red Dirt Girl"" and ""Bang the Drum Slowly"" as mature, adult songs that respond and comment on what it is to be a middle-aged adult in America.Hopefully this is the beginning of James McMurtry reaching a broader audience for his unique brand of contemporary Texas music."
4,I'M BEGINNING TO SEE THE LIGHT....,"We were first attracted to this lamp becuase we have a favorite painting hanging near a rather dark corner of the living room. We thought this lamp would provide the lighting the painting needed, and it did.The style of the lamp is classic so that it fits well with most decors. We also liked the heavy base so that while it looks as if it doesn't weigh very much it will not topple. Also, the dimmer switch allows us to adjust lighting for parties.Let there be light!"
2,not top priority,this game would be so rad if they had a different main character for ps2. i have to give props to the game though awesome fighting game with the rpg style of showing you the number of hp points have been taken from damage. I would give five for the xbox and gamecube i mean they got spawn and link and we got some ... from tekken 4 which sucked. to make this game rad the ps2 people should have made the kingdom hearts version of cloud (from final fantasy 7 for the playstation) as their main character mascot.
2,soul calibur sucks!!,"Let me start by saying that I am not a kid I am 14. First of all this is just like Mortal Cimbat but with swords and it some manages to cheat more. For exmple, in Weapons Master you will fight the same person expert they have a huge advantages like they come in groups of three or sometimes five. Cheating! Now in my strong opion you should be able to set the difficulty of Weapons Mode because eventaully your oppent beomes to sissy by blocking a WHOLE lot. And then there buying stuff. the weapons you get 90% of the are useless no wait lower than that. And the cost for a new outfit is insane. The cost for that is at least the of 4 weapons. You think a new outfit makes your character stronger but it doesn't. So unless you are on crack get this game."

1,Bad sound quility or no sound,"1.When used with the land line I get a lot of hissing and the voice on the other end is very choppy.2.When used with skype the voice on the other end is very quite and cackly and they can't hear me at all.I'm very disappointed because I though this would be a good solution for me, especially after reading the review this phone received from PC magazines and editors choice aware.I will be returning this phone. I would like to find something that works well with a land line and skype."
1,"Thank you, thank you","I was all ready to by this GE Skype phone. Thank you so much to all who took the time to write a review. This product is obviously a piece of junk and you have saved me untold agrivation, heart burn, and the heartbreak of psoriasis."
3,A Taste of Things to Come,"If you enjoy their 'Feeler' cd, you will likely enjoy these songs and their re-mixes very much. It is not like their previous release very much. One thing for certain: there is alot of music to listen to here....well over 55 minutes at an ep price. Some of the songs clock in at over 10 minutes and get a little worn, but it is ok since it is a song and remix collection. Well worth the money........check it out."
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE... WELL YOU KNOW THE REST!""","Though Hooker is a legend, someone with a little more time, could have certainly put together, something better than this. If I was John Lee, I certainly would have wanted something a lot stronger, and wilder, to be my swan song. One song in particular makes me want to use some magical power to get it off the CD, and that's ""Tupelo"". Being forced to listen to that, is like listening to your 6th grade teacher sloooowwwllly scratch her nails on a blackboard. If your image of Hooker, is him, playing a song, in the original ""Blues Brother's"" movie, stomping his feet in the street, shaking up, the entire city of Chicago, then don't get this CD, because it will ruin your memories of him!"
2,A Waste of Money,"I bought this game thinking it was a capital ship type combat game. Instead it is a shuttle combat game. The missions are extremely tedious and HARD even on easy. I got really frustrated with the difficulty of the game and the repetion. The only decent feature is the graphics, which is why it gets two stars overall. I do not recommend buying this game, even if you are a Star Trek Fan."
3,trick,I thought trick was very real to how gay dating can be. If your not a golden adonis you get look over alot. I was surprised by Tori Spelling's performance it was real and very emotional. Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc were very believeable as two gay men searcing for companionship. This movie for me was not about sex but about finding the one true love that makes you forget we live in a world of hatred and discrimination.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I, like so many others, rented this movie because it was a ""gay"" movie, not to mention the leads are absolutly stunning. But, I must admit that it surprised me in many ways. Mainly, because I'd never heard of it, I was expecting one of those cheesy, ""gay boy"" movies with a bad script and even worse acting. I was pleasantly surprised to find a rather intelligent and thought provoking, romantic comedy. I've seen it twice already and plan to purchase it ASAP. Sometimes you've just got to ""grab life by the balls!"""
4,FUN FUN FUN,"It is nearly impossible not to fall for this sunshiny movie, with its adorable leads and delightfully romantic and sexy premise: where and when can we finally DO IT? I found myself laughing out loud at the antics of Tori Spelling, who, with surprising comedic skills, nearly steals the movie away from its mostly male cast. This breezy and somehow old-fashioned gay romance is hard to resist."
1,an average pretend movie,"my God... i switched channels by mistake and i ended up watching the last 20-25 minutes of this movie -thankfully. this is The worst movie i have ever seen. a very bad pretend copy of ""beautiful thing"". there you got the sweet-looking guy, the streetwise guy, and the rest. believe me, i could've written a 10 times better plot for this movie. the dialogues are so so so not the lines you would've liked on a movie. okay, i do understand this is an ""alternative genre"" movie but that doesn't mean it has to be dumb. obviously, they wanted to make BT's american version with a weird twist, clearly, they screwed up baddddd. no two rocks hit the same spot (unless you're really good at it) so please, stop making copies out of somebody else's artwork."
5,"Charming, funny and warm","This is a true gay romantic comedy. The characters are well thought out and wonderfully acted. It is romantic and humorous in all the right places. Campbell and Pitoc are great in the lead roles. Tori Spelling follows up her hillarious turn in The House of Yes as the bitter, neurotic, straight girl/best friend. Yes, there are some stereotypes, but none is depicted in a mean or lampoonish way. It starts about sex, but it's all about romance. Very refreshing in that respect."
4,Funny party movie,"First I have to say this: if you happen to be watching Trick with someone you really like or someone you might be dating, chances are by the end you won't even be watching the movie but each other! I won't go further than that but I think you know what mean! Basically its about two good looking guys that meet on a subway. Gabriel is the struggling writer (of musicals no less!) and Mark is the go-go boy. Both characters truly have more to them than they let on in the beginning and its a treat to watch as they both discover that about each other. Tori Spelling ads color and humor as Gabriels best friend. Its a funny and enjoyable movie that should be watched with LOTS of people; less you be alone, oh boy!On a different note you might come to odds with the fact of how two people could fall in love in one night, or get so into the drama of feelings after knowing each for a short time, but overall its okay."
5,Fun!,"It's funny. Often. Also interesting. It's a kind of ""day in the life of movie"".. It takes you through very diverse scenes and predicaments. It keeps moving along at a nice and unpredictable pace. It's not a kids movie for sure but it leaves you with a good feeling. It's fun, It definately deserves 5 stars."
3,Trick is Tricky,"Christian Campbell can't act, lets face it. He got the kiddy cute face and very sexy eyes.Watch this movie if you want to see lots of bare-bodied male flesh and a full frontal woman nudity. Other than that, there is no plot. If not for the good looking actors, this movie should be given a pass but hey sometimes you just got to watch movie because of the ensemble of pretty casts.Other than Christian Campbell's really cute face, this movie is a boo-hoo. You decide whats best for you."
2,Great Panini Maker But,great panini maker but it was back order for weeks so I had to cancel the order
3,The problem with really great satire,"... is that the most satirical stuff often isn't funny.This book is a rather lame western setting for a biting satire of fame, government, media and history. It has some very funny one liners and plenty of zany moments, but overall the scope of the satire is so broad and the narration so basic that the book reads fairly clunky. Compared to The Time Machine Did It -- a book I read in one sitting, then re-read that night, and subsequently loaned to everybody I could find until it was eventually stolen and I ordered another copy -- this book took me a month, as each chapter piqued my interest but never held it.This book operates on more levels than you can believe for a work of 140-some-odd pages. It just doesn't WORK on all those levels. There's a Simpsons allegory, and honestly that's the best part."
5,"Fantastic, hear it to believe it and you will","I heard Michael last night at the Fitton Art Center in Hamilton Ohio. This kid is FANTASTIC, but you need to hear him. He is a first class entertainer and will wow everyone in the crowd regardless of age.I could write for pages on Mikes music, or write a thesis on what it is like to hear ""Yankee Doodle"", hearing is believing. Check this kid out."
5,A must for any Titanic Collector,I am so glad I spotted Rose! I just had to get it. I also have another version of this doll but I think this one is so much better. She looks more real to Rose. I give this as many stars as I can
2,Follies Lite - too heavily edited,"As many others have said, this is a ""Best Of"" sampler, not a recording of the full concert. There's just enough there on the DVD to let you know that the performance must have been an incredible experience for those lucky enough to be in the audience, but so little there that you don't get any sense of Follies as show - no sense of what connects the songs, and no sense of who the characters are. Also, the video and audio quality are not good."
2,"Kinda' OK, but not really.","If it was backlit, if it wasn't so difficult to ""center"" the needle, it would be a pretty good little tuner for the price. But it isn't backlit, and it is difficult to center. Impossible to use on stage, but if you're on stage you already own a better tuner. Find someone who has one and try it. Then you decide."
5,Very happy with this,"Never in all my decades have I ever used a tuner. Always did it by ear. Got a new bass guitar, and thought that I would grab one of these since the cost was so low, and to see how well it worked. And I was very impressed.Very easy to use, clear display, with green and red lights showing you how close to the proper key you are, red for being flat, green for being sharp.And it was very accurate. Quick and easy, and got a couple of my strings truer than I had, and I thought they had sounded spot on when I tuned by ear.And for this price, a steal."
3,KORG 40 Tuner,"I ordered this tuner thinking it might help as far as tuning a guitar. I found it kind of hard to use. For years I tuned by ear, so using this is new to me. It does help to get the first string in the right range, but afteward, if I went by the meter, it sounded terrible, so I just reverted back to tuning by ear. If you are a beginner it may be the perfect item for you especially if you have an instructor who can tutor you with it's use. Overall I wasn't too impressed with it, but it could be because I've never used one."
1,Not a Good Tuner for Bass Guitars,"Well, bought the ""Korg"" brand for tuning both 5 & 6 string bass guitars. First of all, not back-lit. If you're backstage, you better have a light source or you're out of luck. Secondly, I had to kick in the active electronics for it to even register a signal on B,E strings. The tracking was very neurotic and non-committal. This wouldn't have been an issue if I didn't lend out my trusty Sabine ZIP-700 (..and it was dropped for the last time).Conclusion, if you're tuning up in the dark backstage with no light source on your Sadowsky 5 string, forget it. I'd suggest you move up to a better tuner. On Korgs defense, I really love the DTR-2000 but highly disappointed in this particular product."
1,Suspicious Reviews!,"Click all of the reviewers for this film, and you will notice a suspicious pattern. Most of them only have one review (for this film). Several have two reviews -- for this film and one by the same production company. Hmmmmm."
2,Keeper of the night,"I wasn't a huge fan of this one, but I enjoyed the fact that the story took place on Guam. I rarely come across book that involve Guam. The story was slow and I had a hard time staying invested. In fact, I didn't feel like there was much story at all. In short, Isabel's mother commits suicide, and slowly the reader begins to understand why along with the characters. This book did make me want to learn more about Guam though."
2,A little less than OK.....,"i personally didn't really like this book. i was even willing to put up with the fact that the longest chapter was all of THREE whole pages. what really made me dislike it is that there is no actuall plot to it. each chapter tells it's own story, yet you can't do it properly in half a page. when i finished this book, i didn't feel like i knew the charecter like i usually do. over all, very disapointing."
5,A hidden gem of a book,"I encountered the Creation Memo as a child, after my mother and sister had severely embarressed themselves by reading the book on the tram and laughing so hard that they were worried that the authorities would arrive to take them away.When I first read it, being a kid, I looked at the endless, ridiculous lists of items that God, local subagent of Amalgamated Worlds Creation Pty Ltd, required to create this shoddy, substandard, much-delayed world. Rediscovering it as an adult was pure joy, laughing frequently and from the belly about dodgy construction agents, corporate tax dodges, bribery allegations, strikes, and for some reason frequent injury and illness.I thoroughly recommend this to any fan of British humour, biblical satire or buidling projects. Brilliant work."
1,"Book has been reprinted under other titles, watchout","You really need to look at the text of Karcher's shorter books, as the same book keeps getting reprinted. It's thouroughly annoying to order it used and find out you already own it!"
5,Priceless,"A magnificent documentary that originally aired in AMC in 1998, that acomplishes being an interesting and complete retrospective on the whole ""Planet of the Apes"" phenomenon. An excellent opportunity to update your ""ape-knowledge"" just prior to the upcoming Tim Burton ""re-visit"" (not re-make as he has often underlined) to the Pierre Boulle world. This film is hosted by late Roddy McDowall and includes very interesting and exciting behind the scenes material, such as a first ""ape make-up"" test."
5,I'm Goin' Ape With This DVD!,"About six months ago, I bought the ""Planet Of The Apes"" box-set with the herald ""sixth"" disc, ""Behind The Planet Of The Apes"". So why did I also buy the new 2 Disc ""Behind"" version recently? Because it doesn't monkey around like the original ""Behind"" did! This version has the two-hour retrospective like the original, but so much more too! ""Apes"" N.A.T.O. presentation, more behind the scenes footage, extensive photo galleries, three totally different 1960's featurettes, the full complete E.G.Robinson screen test, and last but not least, an intimate rough-cut interview by Roddy McDowell himself, and it's over AN HOUR AND A HALF LONG! Along with brand new menus, totally different from the original disc, this is a must have for any Apes fan! I'm just goin' Ape with this!"
2,Bad phone,"I ordered this phone hoping it would surpass the 7 year old Panasonic phone i have, however, I was very disappointed! The LCD is sooo bright that you cannot even see the CID name! The speaker phone is terrible! You have to hold the phone to your ear just so the person on the other line can hear you... There is also no battery indicator on the headset. I am notorious for forgetting to hang the phone up to charge and it is helpful when their is an indication as to when the battery is going to die. The one great thing about the phone are the various ring tones that you can choose. However, I could not figure out how to select the ""VIP"" ring tones for specific people. Over all, I would suggest spending a little more money on something else."
1,Poor audio quality,"Returned first unit same day purchased, second unit better than first, however audio is 'scratchy'. GE non-responsive, replaced second unit with purchase from other manufacturer."
5,"""Love These Little Wipes""","I recently retired from a power plant where I used these Allegro Safety Glasses Lens Cleaning Wipes every day. I loved how they cleaned my glasses in a dirty, dusty environment. I knew I had to have these same cleaning wipes at home that I had used at work. I was very happy to find them on Amazon."
5,French Movie Collection,"I recently purchased Contes Pour Tous - Coffret Collection 1. I am really impressed, as the discs all look brand new. There is not a single scratch on them. I felt the price I paid was well worth it."
3,"""DIASPORIC PEDANTICISM""","While the topic of the book is certainly of personal interest, the author reminds me of that type of writer who exercises his 'craft' with thesaurus in hand. While a simple sentence would more than suffice the reader is forced to sit through major 'malapropisms'. Fuggedaboutit.Dan H"
5,One Of The Best Fighting Games Ever,"If you have ever played a weapons fighting game, you will know that they are usually bad. I usually get bored of them quickly, and will never play them again. But, alas, this didn't happen to me with Soul Calibur 2! I am still playing it after beating weapons master mode (you can unlock over 200 weapons here), and arcade with every character (even the 3 special ones). Now, there are really no flaws, other then the fact that the levels are just to small to have weapons on. You can easily throw somebody off the ledge, and win that quickly. If you want a great fighting game that you can play for hours, with no major flaws, this is the one to get."
5,This... is... GREAT!,"This is a very great Arcade Fighting game! This has role play action (weapon master), your good old Arcade mode, and some other great features. The graphics are a good way to buy this game. And last but not least, the characters. They are what you want! Anything from demonds, warriors, and others!"
4,Great game,"Graphics are awesome, different game modes are fun, but if you are not really into fighting games then it will get boring pretty quick. I thought I would give this game a chance and didnt let me down. Overall good game."
2,Disappointed after 1-1/2 years,"I bought this phone for $67 through Amazon.com from a company named Thomson. I was very happy with it, especially the larger handset display for caller ID. However, after just 1-1/2 years, the handset display has become illegible. I contacted Thomson, and they gave me a ""reset"" procedure to unplug the phone jack, base power cord, and remove the battery. That did not help. Thomson says they cannot help any further, can't even give me any service center info for my area, as they no longer make phones! Now I see through the Amazon site that this phone is discontinued, and others have had problems even finding new batteries. Very disappointing after such a short time period, I feel I was sold this item only to become disposable."
2,GE--Big Button Cordless Phone,The phone arrived in a timely fashion. We had a problem with the ringer and receiving calls for a couple days which we fixed by running the wiring through our caller id receiver. I think that the wires we received were faulty. Other than that the phone works fine.
3,ANKO TAPE ADAPTER,"The cable lasted longer than most tape adapters I've had, but its ribbon thin. The sound quality isn't as good as others either. Lasted me about 6 to 8 months of constant use. Wasn't too happy with it."
1,Dead on Arrival,"I unpacked the adapter and put it in the cassette player in my car. It churned for several seconds, then the player spit it out and showed the message ERROR 1. I tried several more times, same result. The player in my car successfully plays music cassettes and works fine with another adapter similar to this one (which unfortunately broke, therefore requiring a replacement). I do not recommend purchase of this item."
1,Purchase Mistake,This adapter didn't work for my car. I drive a 2001 Ford Taurus. The cassette adapter made an awful noise and would eject after a few seconds. I'm going to try the Sony adapter. It specifically indicates it designed for more most car cassette players where the tape insertion is on the side.
5,Great for those long drives to Vegas...,"This adapter works really well in my car. I use it for those long drives when you can just start your playlist and listen for hours (since you don't want to be picking songs on your iPod/iPhone while you're driving). You pop it into the cassette player, attach the cord to your iPod, and start your playlist. Don't blast the volume on your iPod, though, or you'll get a lot of distortion. Keep it about 2/3 high then use the car stereo's volume control. The sound quality is pretty good -- as good as your cassette would normally give with a tape. Great for the price. The only negative is the cord is kind of short.."
3,Excellent & Poor Quality,"The first one I received from Amazon was defective. The clock would not increment, thus I could not set the timer to record programs. After returning the first one and receiving a replacement, it works flawlessly. The DVD picture quality is great and the quality of VCR recordings in EP mode is fine. Only annoying part about the VCR playback is that the first 5-10 seconds are always a bit fuzzy along the bottom of the screen. The auto-tracking feature has always cleared it up though."
2,hard to focus,"we sent it back 12/1/09 it is now 29th of Dec and still not credit back to my credit card. I don""t want to pay for the item and then have a credit. I only use this card for here"
4,Hallmarks of the Southwest,"Well-organized reference with many different artists & a must for SW jewelry collectors. I would have liked to see photographs of each mark as well has the drawn examples. Believe it or not, this can be critical when identifying faint, double-stamped or partial marks."
2,OK book,"I've been able to find some of the marks in the book but so many times the marks I'm looking for are not listed. I was also surprised that some names, such as Harry Morgan, were not in the book."
3,Hallmarks of the Southwest,"Gathering a comprehensive list of SW silverworkers to include their hallmarks is a daunting task, given that the work of these artists covers many decades. Further, the artists are from a huge geographical area where modern communications are limited or lacking, such that, to get accurate information and confirmation would require a tremendous amount of travel, time, and expense. The book is a remarkable attempt in that regard. However, it is also strewn with errors, omissions, and misidentifications. There is scant information on many of the artists, and in some instances 2 different artists are confused as being the same. There are other similar works that are more comprehensive, useful and credible than this particular piece."
5,The Drive,"The first book I have purchased since deciding to become a game writer. The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Design is definitely one of the best books I have ever read, and gains the reader such an insight into the game industry. They take you into a different perspective of writing even if you have been doing it for years. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to go into game writing."
5,The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Design,"The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Design balances the artistic and the technical sides of writing smoothly. The incorporation of writing exercises throughout coupled with examples in the back allows the fledgling writer to evaluate their own writing compared to the author's. The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Design starts with basics for an beginning writer, continues with the nitty gritty of game specific writing, and finishes with a valuable look into the business aspects of writing for video games. Over all The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Design is a comprehensive, easy-to-use tool for the first time writer and a great resource for the veteran as well."
4,Lots of information,"This is a good book for entry level open water swimmers. The specific information on swimming in the open water is very good and useful. However, as a professional swim coach, I noticed a large part of the advice on how to swim the freestyle (front crawl) stroke is simply outdated. If you disregard the parts on how to swim freestyle (and instead find a coach to work with you), this book is very, very informative."
4,Great basic coffeemaker.,"I have had lousy luck with coffeemakers over the years, so when my free Gevalia unit gave out I found myself in the market again. Saw very positive reviews on the DCM2500B and got one.Love the very large filling area under the one-piece swing up cover. Controls are straightforward and easy to set. The unit actually keeps the coffee HOT for the two-hour warming cycle. The only flaw in the whole unit is that condensation runs down the outside back of the machine when you take out the filter basket to clean it.For the price, the DCM2500B is unbeatable."
2,Black & Decker SmartBrew coffeemakerDCM2500B,"I like the carafe very much with the plastic edged trim. The coffee is easy to pour and doesn't spill. I wish the coffee could be kept hotter so I don't have to use the microwave before drinking a cup.The heating element needs improving. The coffee is luke warm, at best, even if I let it sit in the pot it never gets hot."
2,Leaking Carafe,This thing is driving me crazy. No matter how careful I am with the pouring ether water or coffee I manage to have a spill down the side of the carafe onto the table. Happens with lid up or down
1,Broken,"We bought this coffee maker because it is one of the few products that does not beep at the end of the brew cycle. The product arrived defective. When I filled it with water to run the first cleaning brew, it leaked all the water out from every seam. I would not give the product any stars, because it never worked, but Amazon forces you to give at least 1 star. The other impressive thing is that the Amazon partner company electronicsexpo.com refunded the money for the coffee maker, but not shipping either way. The return policy states that because we decided to return, not exchange the product we must pay shipping. So basically, I paid about $20 to transport a broken piece of junk to and from my house. I wouldn't buy from them again, nor would I recommend them to anyone else."
1,Such a disappointment,"I got this coffee maker and about 3 months later it stopped working. The heating mechanism was defective or something, but it stopped brewing. So I sent it in and got a replacement...the replacement had a broken hinge. So whenever I open the top, it falls all over the place. But it's still connected to the water head so I can't just take it off and put it back on when it's time to make coffee. This coffee maker has been such an annoying experience. But it is just coffee and it wasn't that expensive. BEFORE it broke, the coffee pot worked just fine, and I really liked it. But end of story...I will not be buying Black and Decker ever again."
4,Nice for the price.,"Works well and the carafe is one of the best pouring I have ever used, it may not be totally drip proof but it is as close as any I have ever used.Makes good coffee and is relatively quick doing it. For the price you cannot beat it."
3,Good but not hot,"This product is just the right size for my space, especially since its capacity is on the larger side. It looks fine except the small digital clock on the base. I wish the numbers weren't red. It gives it a dated look, but I am sure I will get over that. The main problem that I have with the machine is that immediately after brewing, the coffee is not hot enough. I have to leave the coffee sitting in the pot so that the base can warm it or pour and put it in the microwave for a few seconds. If you like a real hot cup of coffee you might want to make the judgement call about whether you can wait a little while or put extra effort into making it happen before purchasing this product."
1,worked for 17 days,"I purchased this 17 days ago. It worked fine the first 4 times, then the basket began to have a lot of water left in the grounds, then it started making loud wierd noises, then it just didn't do anything. I had bought it because I bought the same thing about 3 years ago, and it had worked great until one day I turned it on and nothing happened, just like this one did in 17 days.Also, the old one I could clearly see how much water was in it by looking in the side 'window'. Not so with this one, the glass is too dark.I'd suggest looking elsewhere for a coffee maker."
3,Tepid coffee,"The clock and auto brew was easy to set, BUT since we add cream to our coffee it simply was not hot enough. We gave up on this coffee maker after two weeks and went back to our percolator."
3,Nice coffemaker with problems,"Bought the Black and Decker DCM2500B based upon price and recommendation. It is a much better designed coffeemaker than the Krups I replaced. However, it is easy to program, had a terrific carafe, pours beautifully, and easy to clean. The downside is that after less than a week, the on - off switch broke and I had to call customer service. Customer service is very hard to get through to, is not listed as 'Black and Decker, their website is practically useless. I got lucky the second day and got through. After that things went smoothly- I cut off the cord, mailed it in with the receipt and $7.50 for return postage. I didn't like the policy of having to pay to return the merchandise and also to pay shipping on the replacement for a week old, defective unit. Not a good way to run an e-commerce business. My best advice buy it- but buy it in a store where you can bring it back! By the way the online price has been dropping faster than the Dow Jones!"
3,Good enough--when it works,I have bought two of these coffee makers within the past 2 years. The first one stopped working after about 1.5 years. The heating element stops working. The second one was a replacement for the first and after only 4 months the heating element stopped working. I think there is a serious design flaw with this coffee maker and you can't open it up to repair it. Since shipping to a factory repair is almost what the thing is worth I'll get a different brand for the third one.
4,Great Coffee Maker for the PX.,"It's simple to set up and easy to use. It makes a good pot of coffee, and looks nice on the counter. Its a good machine for the PX.."
2,Lasted One Year,"I chose this model because it was Consumer Reports most highly rated drip coffeemaker. Immediately the hinge on the lid broke, so you have to hold it with your thumb whenever you pour coffee. Hard water has caused a problem with our coffeemachines in the past, so I have been scrupulous about giving it a vinegar rinse every 6 weeks and using filtered water... to no avail. The machine just stopped percolating today, One year and 2 months after purchase. I called B&D as there were no ""troubleshooting tips"" in the accompanying pamphlet, but they just said, ""Hmmm, don't know. Guess you'll just have to buy another."" Not another Black & Decker thank you very much."
2,Great For The 6 Months It Worked,"This is a great coffee maker for the 6 months it actually worked. I will not purchase this model or any Black & Decker model since this guy had such a short life.One down side is that is turns off after being on for 2 hours. I thought this was a great feature when I ordered it...so I never have to worry about leaving it on by accident and leaving the house. However, there are many mornings that I make coffee very early and by the time my husband is ready for a cup, the machine has turned off. Coffee snobs would say you should make a fresh pot if it has been sitting out that long...but we aren't that fussy and wish this feature could be switched on or off to suit our needs."
2,Takes forever to brew,"This is an okay coffee maker. The only problem I have with it, is that it takes 25 minutes to make 10 cups of coffee !! I've had this coffee maker for about 2 weeks, and the whole family has decided that we should return it because it takes so long to brew coffee."
1,4 months and heater busted,"Careful seems a bit fragile the heater no longer works after being four months old. Expensive device for only four months of usage. Further the clock light is a very, very bright red. Just something to keep in mind."
4,Uncomplicated and Dependable,"This is our second SmartBrew Coffeemaker. Our first one is 2 years old; it still works but the heat plate is rusting and programing feature no longer works. We bought our first because Consumer Reports gave it a good rating. It's a straight-forward coffeemaker. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles and doesn't look as nifty either. But, it does the job for us. I can program it if I need that feature; if not, it brews a pot in about 10 minutes. It makes very good coffee and we do grind the beans before we brew each pot. We're very satisfied."
1,Didn't work. :^(,"Followed the directions to the T. Will try again and report if I have better luck.Not a single single seed sprout. I will flush the spots again, double. I have an irrigation system so the spots were regularly watered down before, and I had been hand flushing before I followed the directions.Oh well.Will try again. Maybe I did something wrong? Areas are in a mix of full sun, sun/shade.She is a small 13 pound dog."
2,"Didn't really work, but we have harsh conditions","We have a shaded patch of lawn that the dogs (three giant breed dogs) use for their business. We have tried everything to grow grass here and it usually starts going brown and then dies. We recently had it re-sod. Patches returned immediately. So we bought K9-turf. We were thrilled when a few little blades of grass started showing up. But that was it. No more. Two stars might be a bit harsh, but it didn't work for us so I couldn't justify rating it any higher.Update: We tried it a second time a couple months later with about the same result. In this trial we tried to keep the dogs off it. In fact, the first week, the dogs were boarded. But again, a few little blades of grass showed up and then everything died. To be fair, we have a small shaded patch of lawn that three giant breed dogs are using."
5,Best Product So Far....,"I used a number of the high $ products from my local ""big-box"" home improvement store. This is the only product I have had success with. I simply put the product down, (on bare ground) and watered it once. I did this in August when it was hot, humid, and we had little rain; yet, the product still grew grass. Extremely Satisfied."
3,"Works at front yard, didn't work much at backyard","I bought this last year and applied on both front and back yard. The color doesn't match our existing lawn. but that's fine. The grass at frontyard grew faster than I thought. However, at the backyard where there isn't much sunshine, the bare spots are still bare. I removed dead patches and plowed then spread grass seed, but only tiny grew out.I saw my questions is replied that I don't have to remove the dead patches. Maybe I'll try one more time with the yellow patches I have now at front yard after I used maybe too much fertilizer.Not sure if I'll buy this small bag or try Truevalue big bags.I bought a one pound Truevalue small sunny and shade grass seed bag and it is $5 (expensive too). I do think this bag is a little pricy compared to other brands. I really regret not having bought a bigger bag."
4,Fast growing seeds!,This stuff really does work. You will notice growth in 2-3 wks. Wish I could buy a larger bag of this at a Home Depot or Lowes.
4,"Raw, Old School PUNK!","When I first bought this album my expectations wern't very high. I bought this along with an old Vandals album. I must say being a greatest hits album it wasn't so great.First I'd like to point out that if this is a greatest hits album then how can you have an 11 second song on here and claim it one of your greatest hits. It seems theres a lot of songs on half a minute that made it onto this album, that's just kind of weird not exactly bad.I bought this for fourteen dollars which is a good deal for 28 songs. There really are some awesome songs on this album like ""Myage"", ""Van"", ""Suburban Home"", and ""Theme"" are the best ones. There arn't that many bad songs but it does get sort of repetitive. There is a bit of humor in this album so it does keep things interesting.If you like punk music that is being made today and is on MTV you will most likely hate this. If you like 80's and early 90's punk then you will love this! This is raw and at the same time sort of catchy"
5,greatest hits from a great band,"A fun and spirited compilation -- a great listen from start to finish!Check out ""Hallraker"" to get a taste of their live prowess."
2,Borrrrrinnnnng!,"Blood Suckers aka Freedom Seeker is not a vampire movie but some unidentifiable genre pic utilizing vampiric themes as well as some James Bond thrown in for good measure. This movie is kinda unwatchable, but one is pulled in by how strange and ridiculous it all is. Blood Thirst is a little better with a sexy fifties lead dude, acting all Mickey Spillane meets Frank Sinatra, is the best way to describe him. This flick was shot in the philliphines I think. This is my least favorite Something Wierd pairing, and least favorite Something Wierd DVD. I have at least half their DVD catalog."
2,Gravy trainin' off the Man in Black,"The instrumentation is actually very good, warranting the 2 stars. However, the singing is awful -- sounds like a bad Elvis impersonator on a Tuesday night in Vegas. I'll bet they got signed based on their band name alone. Not much else to recommend here, other than that."
2,not the best reference material,"If you have to get the book for a class..do, but the book itself has many errors even when it's already in a later edition. the answers in the back is not always correct and there are typos in formulas. There are good textbook in which you would want to keep for reference, but this one is not one of them."
4,Covers Dinosaur Style,"This CD rocks. In typical Dinosaur fashion, guitars sound like jackhammers and vocals require lozenges. Fortunately, this makes for a charming combination and redresses old greats like Peter Frampton's ""Show Me the Way"" and The Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"" in very sexy clothing. In the case of the latter song, the Dinosaur version might even be better."
5,Extension Cable,I recently rewired my boat trailer and found out I was a bit short when connecting to my pickup truck. The extra length was just right to connect to my truck.
1,Don't waste your time,I'm a huge fan of Peter Cushing and the genre...but this was a horrible movie. I have no idea what the people who gave this movie a good reveiw were smoking.
1,Pop gone bad,"Okay I'll admit, J-Me has a wonderful and very powerful voice for her age, but this album did not percieve her potential to a great artist. Her remakes were horrible, though I loved the beats to less than half of the songs the lyrics meant nothing to me. I listened to this album all the way through and was a bit uneased by her production assitant to this album. The only song which I love would be ""Love Is"", which I can listen to every now and then. To me that song is the only one that shows her voice and her potential to become something big. I suggest you not waste your money on this, unless you love the bubblegum pop, dance, trance thing. By the way, I recieved this in the mail, for free. So I didn't waste my money on it. Hopefully her next album will be much better and more appealing to me than this one."
3,good but help not what I thought,I was looking for a Mantis movie about a guy who worked for monks and invented Mantis style kung Fu this is not it and I haven't been able to find it if any one knows what this is please let me know.this movie is ok the story could use more but martial arts are good I likeit ok but I wouldn'd pay more than 3.00 dollars for it
2,Not a complete loss,"There are some very strange interpretations of the origional songs, with the first few tracks being the hardest to tolerate. It gets better, eventually. I agree with another reviewer that the Johnny Cash doing ""I'm on Fire"" is the highlight of the disc."
3,"Pretty good, but could have been better.","I do not own any of Bruce's cds. I would like to hear the original after listening to this. I love a few of the covers. Hynde, Dar, Ani, Harper, Mann/Penn, Cash, and Raul Malo do a great job. I can't help but think that a few of these tracks would have been better if different artists were selected. I am just glad that they didn't ask Melissa Etheridge to do a song."
5,My Break-It-Down Review,"Simple and plain: This movie is what quality Kung-Fu movies are all about. Well done action, well done choreography, wicked fights and awesome weaponry. Gordon-Liu was one of the best, and this is him in his prime. The Shaw Brothers by far were the best Kung-Fu movie production team. (Just ask Quentin Tarantino! He based the Kill Bill series on Shaw Brothers movies.)If you like kung-fu movies and quality ninja-action (where ninja are more than just face-less fighter drones)...GET THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!"
3,Shaolin Challenges Ninja,"This is a fairly decent video with most of the action towards the end. The story was somewhat predictable and could have been developed more. It's definately not in the class of ""Legend of the Drunken Master"", ""Five Deadly Venoms"", ""Kid with The Golden Arm"" or ""Fist of Legend"". However, the action towards the end is worth watching."
1,Useless,"These are just regular scissors. They look different, but they can't do any of the precision cutting that my old pair of operating scissors could. The tips and blades are too blunt. The blades are also fixed so tightly together. I couldn't even cut my nails smoothly with these things."
4,Great,"This is a great book but if you know nothing about the glass, how do you look up the items you have."
5,The Man From Snowy River,My VCR tape was wearing out so we decieded to get a DVD My son is 7years old and watches it all the time .
5,Great Movie,"Good, clean, family movie. A great addition to the family collection of DVD's. A great sequel to the first movie."
2,Where's the anamorphic widescreen?,"Good God! One of the great ones, an honest to goodness five star movie, full of sweep, adventure, a stirring soundtrack and the gorgeous outdoors, and what does Disney do? They put it out only in 4:3 pan and scan. A widescreen version would better respect the source material and upgrade this review to five stars."
1,Showed Up Not Working and Not Working Well If It Had Worked Anyways,"In addition to arriving broken at my home, the product page should be amended to note that the Soleus only claims to chill bottles to a maximum 20 degrees below the current temperature. Which is to say, on a 90 degree day that bottle of white isn't leaving the mid seventies at best.Also 4-bottle should be amended to 4 very standard bottles. When it comes to champagnes and any kind of long-necked bottles it will hardly hold one, much less four.I suppose giving it one star is a mite unfair considering I've never really gotten to see the thing in action, but had I known of this unit's limited capabilities and space I would have never purchased it in the first place."
5,"Love, love, love it!!!!!","Couldn't stop watching it. I just loved this film!!!!! It was funny yet heartwarming. I absolutley fell in love with the male lead...can someone say HOT!!!!!! I watched the extra features and I wonder why it took Korean audiences 15 years to realize what an amazing talent he is. Adorable!The female lead was awesome as well. I really liked how she would be vulnerable and silly yet warm, loving, sweet and smart. The chemistry between the main characters really made this film one of my favorites. I enjoyed all the supporting roles too. The story line is great and just when you think you have it figured out, they throw something new at you...very entertaining.The love story is wonderful and I would definately recommend to any Kdrama lovers!!!!!"
1,"Great film, horrid DVD.","If you're looking for bootleg DVDs with bootleg ""quality,"" here you go. Red Sun or whatever their name is, is a bootleg company that steals the image quality from Hong Kong DVDs and sells it as their own. They then put out crappy bootlegs like this here and have their stooges post how great they are so you buy their releases. The dvds are poor, have audio and image issues, and fall apart in a year or so. If that sounds ""Great,"" ""superior,"" etc. please feel free to buy this release. If not, get the actual releases from Hong Kong for cheaper prices and see something great."
4,Shaw Classic!,The very first Shaw Brothers movie I ever saw. Didn't know anything about them before seeing this. I was completly mind blown when I first saw this film. Great story and action. Although I think this movie is a bit overrated it's still a true classic!Every collector should have this
4,good old school Shaw kung-fu,"This is an good old-school kung-fu flick from the Shaws. It stars two famous fighters - Lo Lieh and Liu Chia-hui, so the fighting is quite intense. An appearance by Wang Lung-wei is also welcome, but brief.The DVD is quite good, semi-widescreen (1.85:1) instead of the normal 2.35:1 and you can tell there's picture cut-off. But the picture quality is great as is the sound.A very enjoyable (but predictable) film, the fights between Lo Lieh and Liu Chia-hui are excellent."
3,Americanhistorybuff,"Well written story of a little known episode on American history - war crimes committed by the Japanese on prisoners or war. Author Marc Landas' research is well documented and the story easily read. The book reveals the unbelievable atrocities against our soldiers as well as what many would consider a ""pass"" to some of those who were responsible. The desire by the Allies to build a friendship with Japan led to some cover-ups and early clemency for some of the perpetrators."
3,fair price,for the price of this box it is what it iscat boxes with full covers are more effective with smell and mess but for the price this works fine
2,NOT SO,This item was defective and has been replaced with no questions asked.I am very pleased with Amazon's handling of the problem with DRUEKE MAGNETIC CHESS.>
3,"Nice, but very small","Overall a nice set, but very small, not something that someone with large hands could use. The magnets are applied to the bottom of the pieces, so they are a bit topsy, but its okay, for the money"
2,not that great,I also heard this was a great set but...1)There is not enough room for the pieces to the side as they come off the board.2)I prefer a green/white color combination3)the bishops and pawns look too much alikeI would find something else.
4,drueke chess set review,"it's a nice set. i love that you can save your game, unlike the other boards that fold in half. the magnets are fairly strong. it's somewhat hard to tell the pawns from the bishops. a tiny dab of white paint would fix that.the lid doesn't really lock onto the base when you close it. so far this hasn't been a problem, but i feel that it should 'lock' on there somehow.it's the best travel chess set i've had."
2,"Nice for travel, but you won't use it for anything else","Bought this for my kid for Christmas based on all the good reviews. Got to wonder if they got a different version of the game than we did.Its nice you can close the lid and later resume your game.What isn't nice is that the paint sticks to the magnets better than to the board surface. The Bishops and pawns are almost identical, and the pieces are ultra cheap (the top edges of the rook break way too easily)Saw a different set at SupernationalsIV for last week for $3 that has all the features of this set, and NONE of the drawbacks. The $3 set was smaller, fits in a shirt pocket, could be closed and game resumed later etc....Also, it doesn't label the ranks and files, so recording your game is more difficult.Not worth the price."
2,Paint pulls off chessboard,"As another reviewer wrote, the paint will pull off when you leave the pieces on the board when you store it. It is made so you can leave the pieces on the board when you close the cover so you think they would have accounted for this and make a better board. I am surprised with all the good reviews. I will be looking for a new set to replace this one."
5,Great Album!,"This is a great album, very dark, very progressive, excelent production. I love it! Great Song too!! The only bad thing is the photos, Queensryche looked so GLAM in this photos, but that's okay, it was the 80's and they were in their middle 20's. Buy IT!"
3,Oni is a decent game,"I absolutely love Oni in the respect that it is a great action game and that it is in 3d with an great storyline. The downsides are very important such as the fact that you cannot save the game!! It has an auto save, but when your close to beating the level you dont want to start way back and do the whole thing over again!! The last and least thing is the fact that you cannot configure your buttons. The game puts all the buttons within your reach but some people like using the up, down, right ,left arrows instead of wasd."
3,"Curiously addictive, but deeply flawed","I have many gripes with this game: the poor save-game system, the bland level design, the constant switch hunting, etc. I have found that it is, however, and in all fairness, a very addictive game. Much of the addictiveness comes from the crisp and innovative fighting system. Some of it comes from the intruiging cut scenes, a few of the games surprise plot points, and an overall ease of play.Clearly the designers of Oni had some very good ideas. It's strange to see a game that got so much right and, yet, got so very much wrong. There are certainly elements of this title that I would like to see implemented in future games, and I would definitely keep an open mind if I heard that Oni 2 were in development.As it stands, however, its a game that balances on the thin edge of innovation and frustration. As it stands, I can't recommend the game at full price, but I have no doubt that it will be the jewel of the remainder bin."
3,A real Macomber.,"I loved Navy Husband. Actually I felt like I'd read it before but enjoyed it still. Classic happy ending, which I love.Keep them coming."
3,The quality is always there even if the subject matter doesn't always intrigue,"William Kennedy's career as a journalist serves as the basis for this collection of his non-fiction. Broken into sections that discuss writing, writers, book reviews and a variety of character studies, RIDING THE YELLOW TROLLEY has a sense of organization often missing from this type of collection. There are a number of fascinating pieces here, from the dynamic interview with Gabriel Garcia Marquez (which provides the title for this collection) to wonderful sketches about Sinatra and Louis Armstrong. But the problem is there are just as many book reviews and profiles of writers where the subject matter just didn't hold my interest. Kennedy is a writer of talent and his career in journalism gives a solid foundation for this type of collection; I just found his insights that centered on personalities more intriguing than those where writing was the focus."
3,You'll only like this if you're really into instrumental,"The only way you'll really get into this collection of ""underground"" music is if you've got a lot of time to listen to it. If you don't, then I suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Masterpiece from days of past,"One of the earliest pieces I hav found that throroughly examines the correlations between astrology and tarot. But this book does so much more than that. His book details in depth interpretations by each sign and planet within each house and gets beyond the basic rhetoric one finds in many modern books. I constantly find that I am drawn to this book (published 1901) and many other ""old"" books regarding astrology and tarot, as they aren't simplified or dummied down for anyone. The words may be antiquated, but the education offered is indepth and priceless."
3,Good price for the features,"I bought this product just before a trip to Alaska - price was right, light weight and has good magnification. During use I noticed the Eye placement is not very comfortable, most of the time you will have to hold it slightly away from your eye - I wish it had soft receptacles like the other larger binocular that I have. Resting it over the eye would have provided a better support.This would be a good buy if it is meant for light occasional use - standing on firm ground. Even at lowest maginification (because it is already 10x) there is a mild shake perhaps due to wind and unsteady hands.If I had known how often I will be using the binoculars in a moving platform such as cruises, train and bus rides, I would have gone for one with optical image stabiliser."
5,Usborne First 1000 Words in Spanish,"As a second grade teacher who teaches Spanish to his students, this book was a big help as well as an excellent resource for the kids. It was an often used resource and invaluable when it came to helping the kids who were having a more difficult time learning the vocabulary and the simple conversation pieces."
3,Good and bad,"I loved There's No Time For Love, Charlie Brown but hated Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown. I don't know what they were thinking on that one.Final Grade There's No Time For Love, Charlie Brown A+++ Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown D-."
5,AMAZING! You'll never stop listening to this album..,"I originally saw The Lewd in a small bar in Concord, California. They were so good, that I wanted to find more about them and order as many cds as I could. Most of their albums are out of print since they're so old, but thank god they decided to make this cd. Every single good song The Lewd made, is on this album. This is a must buy for any punker! It's a shame they don't still make new material."
5,Led Zeppelin green t-shirt,"this was a gift for my daughter after christmas, i didn't know amazon had these type of things...arrived in very good condition,fit as said, color and printing she said was very nice,Great seller will do business again."
2,not for BIG Big blue Filters,I guess I didn't read the description well enough because I thought these were for the 4 ft Big Blue Filters by Pentek - but they are not - they are tiny....
3,basic Calculator,"work well, touch good, large displaybut no root (sqrt) and no power function.dose not remember last function(ex: normally when 2X2 and prest ""="" it shows 4and then press ""="" again it shows 8 and ""="" again 16............but this calculator dose not. it shows 4 only. nothing change evenyou hit ""="" countinously."
5,Used everyday on our trip,"I purchased the calculator mainly for its currency exchange function. During our last trip to Central America, I noticed that I would either pay too much for items or take too much time converting prices in my head. So, on to Peru with this product and it was one of the most useful things I brought along. I used it for everything from meals to gifts, etc. Shopping and bargaining was so much easier when I can relate the prices to U.S. prices. After saving the currency exchange rate, it would take 2 button presses to convert your value from dollars to ___ or from ___ to dollars."
3,Creeps back beneath the saddle. The ties are ineffective,The size and thickness of this pad is nice and it is of good construction but it slides back beneath the saddle despite the leather ties. It badly needs some nylon straps - one at the pommel and one or two more to go under the saddle flaps to keep it in place and from sliding back. Would be a good pad otherwise. I plan to purchase the nylon strapping and have sewn on myself which is an aggravation.
2,not too bad for the money,the mic sound is very good but i have trouble with one mic the power keeps going out so iam not to happy with that.
2,False advertising,The photo you see in the description is an old version of this model. There is a newer re-vamped version that only has a single XLR connection. Yet the manual diagram still shows TWO XLR connections! I can only speculate what is going on with the Pyle company. But they obviously forgot the send out the memo on the change. Every website on the internet is showing a false description.
3,A minor hit at home,"Not as good as some of the Eric Carle classics; I can't see it being read as much as ""The Hungry Caterpillar"" in our house but it's still a good bedtime story standby."
2,The story behind the story is more interesting,"This book is simply not that great. The rubber ducky sound at the end is cute but nothing to applaud. The art is borderline awful and, while the story behind the story is cute, it just did not come out great as a children's book. I must confess, I am not an Eric Carle fan though, with the exception of The Very Busy Spider, which I enjoyed. To put it simply, don't bother. The two redeeming qualities of this book are 1) it teaches counting well (the first rubber duck, the second rubber duck) and it exposes the kids to animals you do not see every day (octupus, flamingo, pelican)."
1,"International Human Rights in Context: Law, Politics, Morals",This text is hidous. It reads like it was written--or edited-- by a group of adult ADD patients. It doesn't explain its numerous abbreviations. It doesn't contain a credible index and it has no glossary. I would not recommend it for any thing use other than good use in an outhouse--far better than old Sears catalogs.
1,New Faces VHS,This is the very first item purchased from an Amazon supplier (and I have purchased many) which I would classify as a disappointment.I expected a new DVD of this 1954 film in a letterbox format and what arrived was a battered full-screen VHS which had seen long and hard service as a rental tape in some video store.This is not serious enough to warrant litigation -- this grumble will cover the matter -- but it teaches me to read product descriptions much more carefully in the future.
5,Superb selection of stories,"Rating a collection of tales by various authors is somewhat complicated. Here, what is offered to the reader is a wonderful selection of stories from various centuries that were written in the Gothic tradition. Anyone who is interested in studying intertextuality or motifs in various pieces will cherish this volume, as well as people who simply appreciate this genre of literature."
3,Attractive but small and poorly suctions,Purchased this item. It came from Touch of Europe. It was packaged nicely and is very attractive but was smaller than expected. The problem is that it does not suction well at all. It would not suction well even when the suction cup was wet to the high chair tray or to the wooden dinner table. It suctioned just fine to the kitchen counter - but that's not where the kids eat. :-)We ended up returning the item at our expense (understandable) and the vendor indicated initially a 20% restocking fee and was actually pretty snotty about it all.The item is attractive but you mayfind it does not suction well which was the entire point. But it could have just been us. But we did order three different bowls each with a different design (we have triplets) and all performed the same - so I suspect it is the nature of the product.
4,Evie,"Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors of classic literature. This book remains true to his style. Wonderful chronology of life in a woodland village in the 19th century. I wasn't wild about the ending, but his novels rarely end the way I expect or want them to."
4,Junie B. Jones And Something Smells Fishy,Would you ever want to have a dead fish for a pet? If you would then Jonie B. Jones And Something Smells Fishy is the book for you. This book is so good because the pictures are great and the story is so well thought out. It all starts out when the teacher claps her hands and tells the class that there is going to be a pet day.
2,What's with this scarf?,"Love EL's books but this tried my patience. Donovan series was better. I think she threw the Donovans in to keep us going. Knew who the 'bad guy' was from the very beginning. No surprises there. All the characters seemed a bit shallow. The final, final chapter about her own life was more interesting than the book. The scarf bit was eerie but then she made sense of it finally. If you are a fan, it's worth a night's time to read this."
3,a good read but no connection,"i have read all of ms.lowell's books and have enjoyed every one. the untamed, forbidden, and enchanted trilogy are three of my favorite rereads. although i enjoyed this story, i found that it didn't do the wonderful character of erik justice. serena was a hint in the book enchanted, a suggestion that they would have a story, but this book isn't it. i kept looking for sven, a secretive character throughout the trilogy, as well as others to have been reincarnated and wonder if he could be niall. the mystery/thriller aspect of the book was very good. however, she failed too give enough depth to the supporting characters that could have made it a tighter read. i suggest that she go back to the past and rewrite the serena and erik tale as well as give the mysterious sven his due."
1,Not Again!,"This novel from Ms. Lowell is once again disapointing. I was especially looking forward to seeing Eric find love after so many years. Ms. Lowell's most recent attempts at writing are more reminiscent of her writing as Anne Maxwell than the Elizabeth Lowell we have come to know and love while she wrote for Avon Publishing. In fact, I am glad I borrowed this from the library before I invested my hard earned money. See her earlier works from Avon for true enjoyment."
3,Disappointed,I was really looking forward to reading this new series especially after reading the Donovan series. This is the first Elizabeth Lowell book that I have read that I was disappointed in. The romance in this book was not up to her usual standard. This book is definitely more of a mystery than a romance. I hope the other books in this series are an improvement.
1,Actually awful,"I haven't read much of Ms Lowells later works. When I read the early reviews of this book, I thought it would be a great merge of old and new. Don't be fooled, it is a droning story of two modern people that keep hinting about the past. I'm almost finished listening to this tape, and it's taken me more than a month. There is just no reason to keep listening."
2,Slow and a big disappointment,"I have not read any of her previous books so I wasn't sure what to expect. I found that I was interested in Selena and Erik's story and Erik the Learned but she didn't often focus on these characters. I found the story to be slow and I made myself, barely, limp through the book. I usually will finish a book I start but I almost gave up. Maybe if I had read her previous books this one would have made more sense."
5,beautiful book,"I recommend this book! Pages are a nice weight, pictures are great, and I like the text. This is a good series."
5,Moving Reading,"As aunt to an adopted niece and grandmother to an adopted grandson, I read these essays with keen interest. The range of issues is fascinating, the breadth of family constellations is impressive and the individual stories are alternately moving, thought-provoking and humorous. I was also impressed by how beautifully each writer told his or her story. I'd recommend this book to any person--adoptive parent, adoptive relative, friend of adoptive family--whose life has been touched by adoption (which I guess these days is pretty much everyone!)."
4,Wonderful,Indigo is a wonderful film for our day in these troubled times. I do believe we have special children coming to the earth to help us in these last days.
2,"Fun for a while, then frustrating.","This is a cool looking game, with fun graphics and sound effects, and an amusing take on the whole RTS thing, but it gets frustrating pretty fast.The problem is that the control scheme makes it difficult for you to do what you want, and the game rapidly makes harsh demands on you, so you find yourself quickly floundering. After you've struggled past the first few levels, the demands become more of a chore than a pleasure.Unfortunate. This game could've been great for kids, but it requires an adult's manual dexterity to make it work."
1,Works good but expect it to break after a while,"I've got this unit on wal-mart.It worked well for 6 months and suddenly stopped functioning.Called Haier customer department for service. They direct you to the website for dealer locator, but hey! There is no locator for service in the website.Called again and the attendant told me she can only search by ONE zip code... and guess? no service in my area.To sum up, I paid for an expensive piece that quit working and no service available...Please do yourself a favor: read the reviews here and on Google checkout so you stop using this brand."
2,It works well till it dies,"I bought this item a couple of years ago. It worked well but had many quirks. Loud fan, Bucket level switch a pain, occasionally blows a rare fuse on one of the circuit boards and since the fan runs continuously the bushings on the fan will wear out before the compressor does."
1,2nd one that's broken,"Absolutely DO NOT buy a Haier!!! We had one that stopped collecting water within 4 months, Haier sent us a new one and now that one shut off and will not turn on. No power, zip, zilch. Of course Haier won't replace it again. BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND!!!!!!!! And let me know what kind will last longer than a year."
1,P.O.S.,"I am a service member, stationed in Japan. If any of you have ever been over here, you'd know that it is REALLY humid. I needed a decent dehumidifier to keep my guitars safe and (unfortunately) bought this product. It worked fine for about 13 hours, after that it stopped collecting water. Don't get me wrong I really tried to give this thing a chance, I even took it apart and checked the fuse and wiring. This was the last dehumidifier the exchange had in stock, otherwise I would have bought another brand (whirlpool, zojirushi, etc.). Normally I would never buy a product from a company that is wholly owned by the PRC government, I guess I've learned my lesson..."
1,A Vampirologist sceptic....are you serious?,"This man attempted to make a career out of ""debunking"" the Amityville story.Was he there? No.Did he try to get involved, but was rejected for his less than believable credentials? Yes.Did he try to make money off the case? Well, this book should answer that question.Was he a skeptical ""vampirologist"".....really? I'm always stunned when the ""skeptical"" answer is less believable than the supernatural answer. In any case, as the Lutzes and people that were actually involved in the case attested, the book and movie were both exaggerated by the creative people. Seems pretty honest to me. Still, the Lutzes seemed honestly sincere and believable in every interview I saw. This loser who was in no way involved, has no business telling the people actually involved what they say. He doesn't know. He wasn't there. And neither was his wife. Loser."
1,Why?,What i don't understand about this book is how this guy can prove its a hoax when he was only in the house 1 time and then could never explain what equipment he used when he was there?
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"This book was not helpful. It read like a public relations promo for the Berman and Co., with a the makes of Viagra also getting a nod. I didn't find the writing helpful, well-written, or in the least bit interesting. A waste of my money."
2,Very Disappointing,"I am a HUGE fan of Third Day. I was really anticipating this album, after ""Offerings"". They and Caedmon's Call are my favorite bands. This album was such a disappointment. Most of the album has verrrrry sloooooooowwww songs. This is the LEAST Christ-centered, worship focused album they've had. Half the songs I can't tell are ""christian"". I reccommend Caedmon's Call ""A Call To Worship""---it is awesome."
5,The Best CD ever....,"I first heard this cd in my friends car, I was crying and he played ""When the Rain Comes."" It was raining and we were driving home from a dance a day befor i was leaving for a new home in 800 miles away, it was one of the hardest moments of my life. That night I cried listening to the cd he let me barrow. The whole cd was all amazing, when I got here I bought it for myself and listening to it brings me back home. This is without a doubt the best cd ever. Every track on there is amazingly well written and beautifully played. My fav will always be ""When the Rain Comes"""
1,third day is the most overrated christian band,"Come on guys. Step out of your artificial christian comfort zones, turn on the radio and listen to what real music sounds like. Southern country hick-rock died just after hootie's first album, but apparently Mac Powell didn't take notice.Only in CCM can bands like Third Day put out such crap and still be able to make thousands of dollars. What a joke of a music industry. We need to stop encouraging people from putting out music that belongs in a trailer park.Third Day's first album was okay because trailer trash rock was in back then. It ain't anymore, but they keep on insisting on making people listen to it through albums like Come Together. This album is horrible. I could not think of a worse way to spend $15."
2,Basilica,I am disappointed in this book. The author's scattershot presentation of a subject that should be fascinating leaves this reader longing for either a scholarly approach or a personal one. This book tries to mix the two.
1,Truth About this Movie is that......... it Sucks,"Where do I begin? Well for starters the poor dialog, the complete lack of any plausible plot line, and the absence of acting talent. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It was a complete waste of time if I were able to give it demerits I would have DO NOT RENT, DO NOT PURCHASE, DO NOT EVEN BORROW IT FROM A FRIEND."
3,Actors Play it Over The Top,"I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice. Because of the over-the-top campy acting I can see where many people wouldn't enjoy it. The acting isn't bad ... it's just campy. Tim Robbins is an excellent actor and I really enjoyed Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton (their acting is very different in this movie). Much better than watching car chase after car chase in all those nonsensical movies made today not to mention the bawdy comedy that is so bad that I cannot understand why anyone would watch it.Loved the music, the camera movement and just everything in general. My husband wouldn't enjoy this movie at all but that's what makes the world go 'round!"
1,WHY DID THEY BOTHER,"Sometimes when a director wins an Oscar, as Jonathan Demme deservedly did for SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, it seems that they decide to indulge their own fantasies. Is that the case with TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE? I don't know, but the end result is a real mess. Inspired by the Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn CHARADE, CHARLIE never really kicks into gear and the performances are all pretty mundane and uninspired. Thandie Newton rolls her eyes and smirks a lot; Mark Wahlberg seems completely out of place and disinterested; and Tim Robbins might as well wear a flag saying DON'T TRUST ME. Add the cameos by Charles Aznavour which come out of the blue completely, a dizzying music video direction style by Demme and a slow, tedious plot and you end up with CHARLIE. Truly a misfire for all involved. Stick with CHARADE and Henry Mancini's timeless score."
1,The worst movie I've seen in years (maybe decades),"The only reason this film deserves one star is because the DVD includes ""Charade"". Do yourself a favor and watch ""Charade"" and skip ""The Truth About Charlie."" This is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is laughable, the directing is a mess, the cinematography is terrible, the editing is inconsistent, and even the soundtrack is lacking. The only decent thing is the plot, but all the other elements of the movie are so distracting that the impact of the plot is completely lost. Which is why you should just watch ""Charade"" and scratch the heck out of the other side of the DVD with your car key in case you're ever tempted to watch it."
1,You know what's wrong with this film?EVERYTHING!,"You can tell the Hollywood is clearly losing ideas on what movies to make next.After the ... awful remakes of both Psycho and The Time Machine,they decided ""Hey,howabout we remake another classic film.""This time the remake is the old 1963 classic ""Charade"" staring Cary Grant and Aurdrey Hepburn,the remake is called The Truth About Charlie,staring Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton and the truth is this movie is one big mess from the start ... and the only thing good about this DVD is that you get Charade on the second side.Take my advice and watch the original instead."
5,Great movie,This has a very entertaining and spritually powerful story. This isn't a movie you will be ashamed of watching afterword.
4,not bad!,"Was so looking forward to this movie! got here soon, and when i popped it in there was a skip in a part of the video so I ended up having to fast forward through a part of it. but otherwise, the rest of the movie was clear!"
2,I'm confused,"I rented this movie via AMAZON VOD after reading all the great reviews. I couldn't get past the first 20 min. I'm a Christian, so that wasn't it. It was just bad acting for me. I found it somewhat painful to watch and found myself nearly wincing a time or two. Maybe it got better as it went along, but like I said, I couldn't watch more than 20 min. Very disappointing."
1,Cruciflicks' Review,"""...as for ""The Grace Card,"" I honestly don't know of anyone outside of the Christian faith who might be able to relate to it. Now, that's not to say that nobody could; this just seems like one that's unintentionally made to preach straight to the choir."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder""I know Memphis Calvary Church put their heart and soul into making ""The Grace Card."" I know most of them are not professionals and shouldn't be held to as high a standard. And I really do admire them for the hard work they did, and for putting themselves out there."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films, check out cruciflicks.net where ""We don't judge people, just the movies they make."""
5,Loved It,This was some the fastes and greatest service. The movie was in great shape and quality. We had no problems with the movie or service at all and would highly recommend these guys to everyone. Thanks
4,Good film,Enjoyed film. Predictable. Hard to find film that is decent for teenage and adult to watch and both enjoy.My teenage son did like it very much and I appreciate being able to watch films that teach good and God and have some action for his interest and for me interesting and yet adult level.
5,Excellent movie,A powerful Christian movie teaching on the power and essence of love and forgiveness between 2 partners who didn't like each other very much.
5,Danger in Quicksand Swamp,"Ben and Jake found a boat with a map inside. It leads to a buried treasure in the middle of Quicksand Swamp. But when they reach the island and start digging, someone ties their boat to the other bank that's surrounded by alligators. So they half-way bury themselves at the edge of the quicksand, wait until the mystery man comes, then push him into the quicksand. I agree with the author. I like the way he setups the story. The way its based actually. Its just like the way J.K. Rowling does with Harry Potter 1, 2, 3, 4. I would recommened this book, Danger in Quicksand Swamp, to anyone. Especially people who like adventure and mystery stories."
5,Heart String Is The Cornerstone Of Earl Klugh's Work,"All of the elements of perfection come together on this recording. The listener is unable to do anything but listen while Earl with his melodic strumming draws your attention away from your conscience state to a near mesmerizing level. Heart String is such a masterpiece that Klugh (perhaps with the exception of Crazy For You)to date, has not compiled an album where the listener wants to hear the album in its entireity, leaving no song out. If you own Heart String, you have the ""best of Earl Klugh."""
1,Boring!,"Don't waste your time or your money, this movie is not funny or scary or whatever. However, The cast and crew they are good, they should've worked in a different set and movie."
2,Boring,"Long and drawn out. Good dark sets, and good acting, but that doesn't make up for the boredom."
1,Shadow of the Sleep!,"Viewed: 12/12Rate: 112/12: Hello, hello...calling for Guiness Book of World Records. Have I got one for you: the longest, most boring opening credits for a film. It ran for six minutes and set the tone for the rest of the film. Hence, Shadow of the Sleep. I've seen Nosferatu several times before, and I tell you: it's nothing special. So, why bother making a movie about how it was made? In fact, nothing in Shadow of the Sleep is true. Hey, remember the wife of Bram Stoker sued the makers of Nosferatu for copyright infringement and won the case which caused the company to go bankrupt? Now, the makers of Ed Wood can do the same too for Shadow of the Sleep. I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe, but this is okay. But John Malkovich? Yech! All in all, please fix the misleading adulation to ""One Of The 10 Worst Films Of The Year!"" for Shadow of the Sleep."
4,More than meets the eye,"Beyond being a film about vampires, and even a historiographic movie about Murnau, ""Shadow of the Vampire"" is a film about the film medium itself as a canvas for recording human memory as well as transfiguring human identity. And it is interesting that Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" was acclaimed as an influential piece that has left its mark in the work of filmmakers as recent as Tim Burton (""Nightmare Before Christmas""), when a simulationist film applying the filming process of ""Nosferatu"" looks BACK on what film is really all about. There have been many films that can mess with your mind, but this one comes in near tops for me, simply because it is hauntingly beautiful."
4,More profound than just a vampire movie,"Like most of John Malkovich movies, there are always more layers than the titles. This movie really isn't about vampires. To me, it was about sacrifice, dedication, and the human cruelty is at the same level as the immortals. To everyone else, you might find something different out of this movie. But if you were looking for something scary and spooky, you would not like this one. This is a movie that make you think.John Malkovich is a great actor as Murnau. If you like him, you would really enjoy his originality, acting and humor. The special makeup for Willem Dafoe is fantastic.This movie is definitely worth seeing. After all, when was the last time you really thought about the idea, ""the vampire and a movie director are no different""?"
2,"great acting,.. excellent cinematography,.. poor story line","I gave one star to the excellent performances by Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich, and Catherine McCormack, and another to great film making. The cast was fantastic; they were able to hold together what little story there actually was. Slow at times, the photography, depicting the early days of black and white German silent films was very good. The character make-up and dress was very good, too. The real shocker was the end: so lame and predictable that I couldn't believe they had actually done it. They must have bored themselves silly trying to think of a finale. It took the life right out of it."
2,Incredibly boring...,"I rate the DVD media and image/sound quality with four stars. The movie itself???? ..... incredibly boring. The only DVD that I have given away because I KNOW I will never watch it again....this coming from someone who keeps an extensive library of DVDs. I can see that this movie was artistically well done and the performance by Willem Dafoe was great....however, the film just did not hold my interest and I am getting a bit burned out with Malkavich's type casting as a deranged lunatic."
3,"Interesting and entertaining, but a bit far-fetched.","I would note that the book has three authors, not just one, and all are accomplished women, so Amazon should list all three.I was continuously curious about the book, and but it took be a while to buy it. I was attracted to the premise -- the loves lives of professional black woman are complex. But the dialogue was almost trite at some points, when it really deserved to be more serious. We don't all cuss at our girlfriends and say things like, ""I know that's right!"" in response to every affirmation. I thought that was silly. But as the plot developed, I couldn't put the book down, and I appreciated the fact that the plot was not predictable. It seemed far-fetched sometimes, but I enjoyed the ride. I agree with another reviewer that the ending could have been smoother.I hope this gets made into a movie -- I think it would make a great black movie."
1,disappointed,"I was not impressed with this book. I read only a little and found it has too much sex.I was under the impression it was more of a love story book, I'm giving it away to the library.I feel I wasted my eight dollars."
1,"breaks easily, can't be repaired cheaply","I purchased an HP IPAQ 4155 several months ago and was initially impressed with its functionality and power. However, the touch-screen fractured shortly thereafter, rendering it useless. I don't recall placing any stress on the screen or striking it, but it fractured while sitting in my pocket in its 'protective' case. Very fragile. The replacement touch screen cost $85 (I was just replacing the touch screen, not the LCD itself)! My trouble was only beginning. I am a trained computer technician, but I could not even OPEN up the damn unit to replace the touch screen without the case breaking into pieces. What a rip-off. They purposefully designed the unit so that you have to buy a new one if anything breaks, or send it in to HP so they can charge you an arm and a leg. I will not buy another HP product."
5,can't live with out my IPAQ,"I am formerly a Palm user, and can't get enough of the IPAQ. I use this multiple times a day (every day) and have never been disapointed."
1,"The problem isn't the PDA, it's Hewlett-Packard warranty!","I bought a pocket pc ipaq and it was very nice, but just for one year...two months after the warranty ended, the product failed to never work again. I sent it to the service, but after one month! they gave it back to me and told me that it is not possible to repair it, or the cost will be more expensive than buying a new one. So I spoke with Hewlett-Packard, and they assigned my case to a ""customer advocate"", but that person is a real HP advocate who told me ""HP products doesn't fail..""??So I have a nice US$700 pocket pc that doesn't work. Next time I will find a minimum 3-years warranty."
1,Screen cracked twice for no reason,"I found it cracked one day. No drops, no nothing. Like a fool I got it repaired only to see it crack again in a different location a few months later.The first time it was the outer glass layer craking from the upper corner. Second time it was a horizontal crack in the LCD layer. Now it's trash.They made it small, but not sturdy enough. It flexes in your pocket even in a case. Stay totally away from this and live happier for it."
4,Good for the right situation,"Although I sympathize with the previous reviewer's problems, I think this product is certainly worth more than one star. I have found it easier to work with and quieter in operation than its Bachmann counterpart. It's true that this is really not a toy train product, but is more for model enthusiasts who want to create a layout which will be at least semi-permanent. I have mine set up on a flat, solid surface and I have run my trains on it for many hours at a time without any problems. I didn't find it hard to assemble (although like any similar model it is rather a painstaking process to make sure it is all properly joined together, not recommended for young children) and I've had no difficulties with breaking or twisted pieces.All-in-all, not a bad product if it is used in the right situation."
5,Excellent resource,I am pretty efficient and fluent in Actionscript. This book highlighted some new utilities (mainly those in Flash MX 2004) for data use which are very pertinent. It also is an excellent resource for Flash Comm beginners. The 2 chapters on Flash Comm will provide excellent insight into the structure of an app as well as non-development tips and tricks.It's a must-buy if you are looking for an excellent resource covering new Flash MX 2004 goodies.
5,Thin chain but it looks lovely.,"I purchased the 24"" chain, which came with its own little draw string bag. Despite being so thin this looks very durable. I would buy more from this vendor."
1,WRONG ADDRESS,"This was shipped to an old address. We've had successful deliveries at our new address, why was it shipped wrong.Our CURRENT address:15619 N.E. Caples Rd. #66,Brush Prairie, WA,98606I don't understand why the wrong address, we've done the address change, and it was scheduled for our new address. Very disappointed customer..."
1,Broke the first time she wore it with her angel pendent,"Brought for a four year old as her first piece of jewelry. She jerked it off with one pull and it was a box chain. I am very disappointed, but won't ask for a refund because she jerked it off!"
3,Pretty entertaining but not terribly informative,"This book isn't a page turner, and it's not a text book either. When you finish it--if you manage to--you're not left feeling much better off. The author tries to be entertaining too hard, at the expense of the content. Still, if you're interested in only getting the barest of outlines concerning various attitudes toward death, burial customs, mythology, etc., then this is a decent read. There's a lot in here, but the author doesn't go into depth about anything, which might be good if you're a layman on the subject and just want a glimpse. If you've just got a passing curiosity on the subject and don't want to go into the nitty-gritty, this might be the book for you. It does have some interesting mythology, and some of the author's personal anecdotes are worth reading, although his opinionated writing style crowds the book. Still, not a bad book at all, and fine for someone looking for just a dab of foreign tradition regarding death."
3,"Decent, but limitted playability","As Tycoon games go, this one is probably a bit above the average of late. Most seem to be junk re-hashes of the same game with different graphics. This one is pretty decent (not to the level of a SimCity or RailRoad Tycoon), but much better than things like Underwater Tycoon, that appear targetted at rather young <13 players.There is a progression that you go up in getting bigger casino's to develop and goals set for you. But I think there were only about 6-7 casino's total and once you did them all, it wasn't really any fun to go back and play the old ones.Bottom line: Looking to kill some time? This will keep you occupied for an afternoon if you like the ""Casino"" theme. If you are looking for something to keep you going for days or is complex, keep looking."
4,Interesting Read,"In this book you will learn that the Gucci Family is disfunctional and a mess. Written with by someone who clearly understands business and corporate law, so be prepared for a lot of technical and legal terms. It is a good read if you are interested in fashion."
3,Intense reading.,"This is a very interesting book about the Gucci family, but it at times delved too much into all the business and acquisitions. It got at times really complexed. Having said that, it was a really good and interesting book. It was almost as if the author didn't want the story to end. I am glad I read it."
2,Dull,"This book was very dull. Although interesting history involving family tensions helped create some entertainment, a lot of the book was repetitive.Very informative, but very dull."
4,"Looks Great, But Had to Modify","This knob looks absolutely fantastic against white doors and the mirror-like chrome finish is great!However, when looking at the photos on Amazon, the knob appears to be a perfectly round ball. When I opened the box, there's a slight indentation front and center. I spoke with a representative from Shlage and the indention IS supposed to be there. I was slightly disappointed but my husband was able to round it out from the inside and it looks perfect now. Can't wait to finish off the rest of my house with chrome knobs! <3"
4,groove to the tunes,"pierdate en el sonido de este cd--te hara mover el cuerpo sin querer. aunque quiza no es tan profundo como otros cds en su discografia, es eminentemente bailable (free-style, of course). anyway, its a fun reminder of an epoca anterior en la history of roc en espanol. --una gringa fanatica, signing off."
1,How could they change a formula with so many loyal fans?,"I concur with all the disappointed long-time, loyal fans. The new formulation is simply awful. I've given it several tries, and end up scrubbing it off each time, so bad is it. I loved the classic. It was an amazing product - fresh, uplifting, with a truly urbane, sophisticated lemony note that belied its affordable cost. I knew I could always go into a drug store, and find this wonderful staple. I've had many compliments wearing this. I would always get an appreciative reaction from my husband on smelling it on my hair. I'm so disappointed in the new 'Original' formulation. It's actually kind of nauseating - a sort of cinnamon note mixed in with the lemon verbena. How in the world did Revlon come up with something so bad? 'Banal' would have been a better formula option than this."
2,Fitting tribute is fittingly cracked,"2 1/2A general sense of detachment echoes through Barrett's solo work, and you could say the songs that ended up working best exploited that very undermining. At best, some decent acoustic songs evoke a tragic beauty but more often at worst this plays as a pity disc a few band-mates threw for a lost brother. Edit-free recording reveals some warmth and humor but ends up sounding sad."
5,No Good Trying - remake,"Classic album!Artist Dimthingshineon recently did a cover of Syd Barrett songs: ""No Good Trying"" and ""Baby Lemonade"" on his latest 4 CD project called ""Nostalgia"" released in 2009. [...]"
5,Deaf Like Me Book,"The book was in great condition, didn't have to pay too much for it. And it is a great book to read!"
3,Not sharpened,"It's a good small hatchet/axe, but I was disappointed it didn't come sharpened and it wasn't denoted in the product description. Now I need to buy equipment and learn to sharpen it so I can actually use it."
3,Where's another CD on the book???,"Today I received the book and I thought that was inclued two CD. But, on the book there was just one!!! I'm unhappy about this!"
4,Excellent Upgrade to HP TC1100 pen,My writing appears finer (better resolution on the tablet pc) when using this pen possibly because the tip is smaller than the one supplied with the HP TC1100. The main reason I bought this is because it has an eraser which is definitely better than clicking the pen and eraser tabs in a program. The button on the shaft is slightly recessed and I have never accidently pressed. The only reason that I gave this pen a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the diameter. I am more comfortable writing with narrower pens but if you have no problem using pens the size of Pilot's Dr. Grip line then this pen is a perfect fit.
4,Solid pen,Provides good support in the hand and feels much like an actual pen. The tip does not give... but other that... all is good.
4,Fun and informative,"This colorful, quick read offers up answers to the question, ""Why does my cat do that?""It's an easy-to-read guide that would be a perfect introduction for kids and new owners welcoming a new cat or kitten into their household. Included is a color photo to illustrate each and every behavior. (How on earth did they get all that on film?)This book is lots of fun for the cat enthusiast, and after a lifetime of sharing my life with cats, even I learned some new things. Now I know why my cat needs to check out her basement several times a day, and why cats love to bother those people who hate them. There are lots of fun facts stuffed into this concise but comprehensive little book. Don't assume all your cat's behaviors are obvious. This book sets the record straight as to why cats do what they do. Any cat lover will enjoy these insights into our feline friends' behavior."
4,Somewhat informative.,This book uses some pictures to show cat thoughts. I guess my cat uses some unusual ones because some of the wierd things he does are not in the book. I especially liked the pages the show cats scent marking their person. The section on body language is good too. Not a bad little book.
4,Excellent introduction to cat behaviour,"Even if you have had cats for years, this book is revealing. And the pictures are great."
4,Interesting and useful information,"I've had cats for a good deal of my adult life. I have four right now. I still learned a several things from this book--perhaps not so much about ""which"" behaviors will occur but the ""why"" behind them. The information seems to be more about outdoor cats; however, I can still relate to much of it even though mine have always been indoor. I feel the book has a good deal to offer and would recommend it. And as many have said, the pictures are terrific."
4,Decent,"What I liked about this book is that Koontz developed his characters very well. He usually doesn't focus on them as much as he does the plot. I liked Dusty Rhodes. Dusty changed his name fully knowing that he didn't want to be taken seriously. His mother gave him a pompous, yuppy name that just wasn't him. Dusty has a heart of gold and he adores his wife and brother, making him very likeable. I would have liked to see the book show more details in the element of brainwashing. I would have liked to have seen the process of the brainwashes. All in all though, this was an interesting book."
3,"Two Different Books; One Good, One Awful","It took me two weeks to read the first half of this book and one day to read the last half. After one suffers through Martie's initial 100 page long ""panic attack"" the book is suddenly transformed from a dull, overworded ordeal into an entertaining thriller that is typical of most Koontz novels. After Ahriman is identified as the villian the book delves into the topic of brainwashing and it's uphill from there. I thought Koontz did a thorough job of researching and describing all aspects of brainwashing and the dire consequenses it can produce. As usual, Koontz used an ""ultra-secrect, quasi-government, think tank"" to make the reader paranoid enough to think that any day now, good looking young men in suits are going to show up to torture and kill average members of society (ie... Dark Rivers of the Heart, Watchers, and Strangers; just to name a few.) The ending was slightly disappointing but also surprising. All in all it was a worthwhile read."
3,"So-so, at times not believable","I had trouble getting through this book for a couple of reasons. 1) the hero is named Dustin (Dusty) Rhodes. This is explained at the very end, but just too corny. 2) the hero's name is rivalled in corniness by his half-brother, Holden Caulfield, but who goes by Skeet. 3) the prose is so thickly self-indulgent. Koontz tries to wax eloquent about the surf, the night sky, etc., but it's just not working. He should stick to fantasy/horror plotting and stop trying to paint us a Renoir with a Wagner power-sprayer. 4) there are too many things unexplained, or not explained sufficiently to be plausible.Read ""Hideaway"" instead. Koontz actually got that one right."
1,False Memory,"Tried really hard to enjoy this book, did not enjoy what I had read,so will not finish it. This is one of my favourite authors, and I am now a bit leery to purchase another of his publications. I was disappointed in this piblication, but I have enjoyed many other if his books."
3,Learn to love yourself (you have to read the book to get it),"this wasn't one of his best, but it was interesting enough to keep the pages turning.... until the end. the way it all ties up(motive for killing, etc) is very, very weak and disappointing."
3,False Memory is True to Form,"With an interesting juxtaposition of the ""good v. evil"" characters, our twenty-something protagonists go through the formulaic Koontz drill. Never any doubt that this ""thriller"" was simply a story, a stretch of the author's imagination, a soapbox to issue social commentary. The clever pet doesn't quite save the day, but does deposit a special bit of humanity. Dialogue is fraught with cliches, repartee is just a bit too cute. Missing the magic (and cold chills) of Intensity. An okay read. Mamalinda would love to see Koontz' characters grow up just a little."
3,Very Bizarre,"This was a very twisted story. I thought Koontz did a good job on the characters, especially Dusty and Marty, and let's don't forget Skeet. The doctor's character was a bit too much for my taste. I agree with the other reviewer's regarding some chapters were just too long. Koontz detailed everything, in some parts of the book this was ok, in other parts, I lost interest. I think the doctor is one of the most evil and wicked characters I have read in a thriller. In my opinion, this was a turn off. Don't get me wrong, a thriller needs to be juiced up, however, this doctor was just pure sick. I think Koontz went a little overboard on describing the doctors games in the past and future, it was to grocely detailed. Overall, I would recommend reading it only if you like groce and evil villians, Koontz does a good job on this guy."
4,"False Memory, Dean Koontz review","As always I enjoyed Dean Koontz's writing but I found this book a bit long. I felt he could have edited a bit more, but he is still my favourite author."
2,"What happened to ""less is more?""","Boy this book was so long winded. It took forever to get into it. And Kootz's writing style ... way, way too much description and detail on everyday things that were boring and redundant. I did, however, enjoy it once I got into it (more than half way through it). Even then, I had to skip the descriptions and details. This book is nothing like ""The Door To December"" (which was excellent!). I don't know if I will be reading anymore of Kootz's books."
5,Marvelously Evil,"I was hesitant to pick it up because I am very particular in the types of books I read and I had never before read a Dean Koontz novel. However, soon into the book I realized how amazing this thriller is....the book is absolutely evil and I was on the edge of my seat reading it. The charactors are well developed and the his descriptions of people are almost poetic. I highly recommend this book--it's amazing!"
2,FOR ONCE I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED ABRIDGED!,I wish I hadn't invested in the unabridged audio of False Memory. WAY too repetitive. Felt sorry for Stephen Lang (the reader) having to essentially say the same thing for minutes on end. Koontz need an editor with a BIG RED PEN!
2,Not up to the usual standards,Not as good as his other books. You'd be better off to skip this one - or get it at the used paperback store later.
2,Short Memory,"Don't get me wrong...Koontz is one of my favorite authors and I immediately pre-order his books before they're released. This one left me cold. It was just unpleasant. Yes, I know this is a horror writer, but usually his books have some clever supernatural twist to them that keeps me intrigued. This one bored me to tears. I finally gave up after 200 dreadful pages. Dean, go back to great themes like you used in Watchers, my favorite."
1,False Memory,"This book is pretty awful and am very disappointed. He usually writes good books, this one is not. The first 250 pages are repetitive and sooooo boring. I have not been able to finish the book because it puts me to sleep. Dont waster your money or time. I would have rated it with no stars if that was an option."
2,Not one of his better ones,I've read 4 or 5 of his books and this one is for sure the worst out of them. I got hooked with Koontz books after reading Door to December and was extreemly hooked with Watchers. Since reading those two first I've been somewhat disapointed with the other three. This one was very disapointing and not worth the time it took me to read 750 pages. I especially didn't like the fact that he had the first few chapters of his next book at the end of this one. That's just not right
1,Silly,"Sorry but the book is silly. Characters act as if they have a script in front of them and mouth what's written there...not natural...of course we have a wonderful couple here whose lives smash into pieces...except that any logical person would overcome those problems the villain allegely lashes on within a week. No fun factor (one of the most boring dialogue writer I have seen around this Koontz man), no intelligent side stories, no underboiling story line, a silly, imitative, boring book...Makes someone wonder how on good Lord's earth these books pass past the editors and publishing houses. To cash in on author's name? May appear better to the lowest common denominator."
2,Koontz has been better,"Am I the only one who thinks that if Koontz did not write with so many metaphors etc. this book could have been 300 pages instead of 600. Ever since STRANGERS and THE WATCHERS I have yet to enjoy any of his books. SOLE SURVIVOR wasn't bad. I feel Koontz's writing is too embellished and monotonous. I was falling asleep trying to keep up with all his wordy paragraphs. After trudging through 300 pages I finally put the book away because I found it too disgusting. I know this may be a turn on to some but it just went too far for me. I got to a point where I really didn't even care about anyone anymore. However I personally felt if Koontz could have cut out half of the boring narrative, maybe I would've finished the book - actually I would have since I read 300 pages and that is about how thick the story should have been!"
5,Are memories real and can they be created?,"I just finished this book and must say that it was hard to put it down until I did! Every time I would try to do something else, my mind would go back to the novel. It's definitely a recommended read if you like thrillers, specifically relating to the notions of mind-control.False Memory basically tells the story of a southern california couple whose lives get changed by the actions of a psychiatrist. This man has the power to hypnotize, and like the movie ""the Curse of the Jade Scorpion"", any time his victims hear the activating name along with a haiku, they become hypnotized and unquestioningly do what the doctor wishes. The psychiatrist is calculating and cold-blooded and uses the people as toys in a game he is constructing. It is up to the couple to stop this man before he gets to them as well..."
4,disturbing but great,"I enjoyed this book from the first page. This was the first Dean Koontz book i've read and i am now a fan. The book really makes you think and open up parts of your brain that has never been opened before. At some parts i was completely terrified, but not in the same way as you would be from watching a gory horror movie. This was a different, realistic type of terror that makes you have strange dreams. It didnt scar me for like or anything, just really made me think. The reason this is a 4 and not a 5 was i really didnt enjoy the ending too much. It was somewhat unrealistic and vague."
2,MAD doc.,"The first half of the book is very slow, so you just keep on waiting for some action.The story sound some how familiar GREEDY DOC WHO WANTS MAKE MORE MONEY BY MAKING PEOPLE SICK AND THEN CURE THEM BY FAT FEE.( SOUND LIKE MANY DOC WE HAVE TODAY )."
1,Read it. Didn't like it.,"I have read several of Dean Koontz books in the past and have enjoyed them. So I was looking forward to diving into this one. Although I enjoy a thriller I found this book disgusting. The graphic descriptions of many sick scenes were totally unnessesary to the story. The basic idea was a good one and at times very interesting, but the needless gore ruined what I was hoping would be a good read. It will be the last Koontz book I pick up."
3,Heavy handed and overwrought but a page turner.,"I had to write a review about this! I'm not sure how to begin.The story is a page turner-no doubt about it. There are parts that are anxiety provoking for sure. My heart was pounding during some it and I actually paged ahead just for a quick glimpse of what was coming! I rarely do that.He's a gifted writer for sure.However............you have to suspend any realistic thinking here. There were times when I found myself rolling my eyes and wondering if I was supposed to take this seriously.I would say the book is a bit heavy handed and overwrought. It could be been leaner and meaner.And of course, it has a warm and fuzzy ending with everyone happy and of course monetarily richer. What else?Not bad at all. I don't want to be negative but really, a bit overdone."
4,Poetic Justice,I loved the way the doctors game fell apart. He did not count on a lot of things happening and underestimated to intelligence of his toys. It goes to show you that arrogance will get you no where.
2,Very disapointed,"I LOVE Koontz, but this was the first book I read by him that I was really disapointed with. It took me a little over a month to get through this. Usually with a Koontz book I am done in about a week.The beginning started out good. I had my hopes up. But it just went downhill from there. I hate to start a book and not finish it, so I was more or less forcing myself pick it up and get through it.Hopefully his next book will be better?"
5,Captivating though Mind Bogling,"Dean Koontz writes an extremly well story, of phobias and hipnosys. The book captivates and yearns for you to read on. Even though it is one of the better suspense/horror/thriller book, in some spots it getts a little mind bogling, and you start to wonder where you are but over all it all ties into what it is about and where its leading too. I say you should give the book a try, its not like any of Steph Kings Novels or Christopher Pike, it is a more indepth and makes you think that maybe just maybe this could really happen in real life. Enjoy the book, I know I did. :)"
1,Overrated,"I was disappointed in this book. It's over-written and unrewarding, not suspenseful in the least. I also tried another of his books, Odd Thomas, and while it was better than False Memory, I won't be reading any more of Koontz' books. Stick with Stephen King -- at least he's not pretentious."
1,Tedious and not worth the time.,"I have tried 3 times to get through this book and now I'm chunking it in the trash can. Other reviewers have commented on the excessive LENGTH of this book. The detail and repetitiveness make this book a huge waste of time. I made it a third of the way through and, after reading the other reviews, I realize it's just a big waste of time and energy plowing through this tome. I've always enjoyed Koontz, but this thing is stupid."
2,Couldn't finish it...,"I've read lots of books with lots of words in them. False Memory was only the second book that I couldn't read in recent days. The other was She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb. I don't read horror, but I liked the concept. When last I left the story, Skeet was in rehab again. Marti's best friend was still afraid to leave the house. Marti was struggling with her own reality. The dog was the only one that knew what was going on in the story. Dusty missed obvious clues that his wife was going bonkers -- guess he was, too. I'm glad other people liked it. I admire Dean Koontz, but it was taking too long for Dusty and Marti to find one another after the craziness happened."
4,A Real Thriller,"The only flaw the book has: it is a little bit too long. The time it takes before the plot gets under way may be the time when some impatient people stop reading and turn to another book. But from then on, let us say from page 150 , this novel is excellent. The characters are very well developed, the plot foreseeable as the author works with dramatic irony from the start, but the suspense does not feed on the question: What will happen? but on: How will the characters get out of this mess? or: Will this villain be punished after all? And Koontz manages to give the plot some nice unexpected twists that keeps your interest alive.What is always enjoyable in Koontz' books is his expertise in dogs, especially in golden retrievers. I have never had dogs, but in some of his novels I really got to like them. His dog characters are a treat in itself."
5,First Koontz Read and a Success!,"I picked up this book with no expectations and not having heard of Koontz previously. I was instantly engrossed in the story and loved the use of phobias (an interest of mine for some time). Since my first reading of it I have read several other Koontz books and this one has remained a favorite. The characters are likable in that way most of his main characters are. They want to live the normal life they had been leading up until the start of the novel, but are thrust into unfortunate circumstances. That is my one complaint really. His protagonists are always satisfied with their life at the start of the novel and they usually end up the same way. The pattern is predictable, but excusable."
2,book,I was forced to read this book as an assignment. From what I remember I didn't like it much. Or maybe I didn't like my teacher for forcing me to read it.
4,Terrific Novel,"Killing Mr. Griffin by Lois Duncan was a great book! When Jeff suggests that they kill their english teacher as a joke, it is taken seriously and the idea to kill Mr. Griffin is discovered. The book goes on to tell the story of how they kidnap Mr. Griffin, take him up to a waterfall, and leave him there for seven hours later. When they return, he is found dead, and the medicine he needed to take in case of a common angina attack was laying several feet away. It continues until the end when the story all unravels and everybody is told what happens. A great book!"
4,Anna's review,"I liked this book, it had strong details. And it showed all of the characters' personalities well. The characters were well developed, and you knew what was going on though out the whole story. It is a great book to read when you are tired of the same old thing!Dave, Mark, Jeff, and Betsy hated their teacher, Mr. Griffin. Mark decided to take Mr. Griffin to the mountains to try and scare him, and make him beg to be able to go back down the mountain. But he didn't beg, Mark decided to leave him there for awhile, to shake him up, but when they went back that night, they never expected, what they saw! Then things just started getting worse and worse!I think anybody who is 12 and older will like this book; it was a little bit harder to read and understand than Lois Duncan's other books."
3,Real Teens,"I thought this novel had a great plot construction. You'd think most of the tension would be leading up to the teacher's death, but there is a good deal more after the teacher's death.Also, I thought the kids in the story seemed real. Their reactions were just like the ones my friends would have"
4,Killing Mr.Griffin,"The novel Killing Mr.Griffin was a good mystery book. In the novel there was a character named Susan McConnell, Susan was a student which was chosen by some of her classmates to scare Mr.Griffin(her english teacher). The purpose of their plan was because Mr.Griffin was strict with all his students. The mastermind behind the plot was a kid who faild before by Mr.Griffin and was seeking revenge, his name was Mark.The students wanted to see Mr.Griffin crall and ask for an apology, Susan on the other hand, was feeling uncomfortable with what the students were doing with Mr.Griffin. The students had no idea that Mr.Griffin had a medical condition, not knowing they left him to his death.They buried him ,but they left the pill case which held Mr.Griffins medication. The pill case was discoverd and reported to the police. This event lead them to a slow breakdown.Carlos"
4,Barbara's Review,"The book was ok. It wasn't like I thought it would be though.Susan McConnell isn't what you would call pretty and popular. She was a teachers pet and a straight A student. The preps Mark David, Jeff, and Betsy knew this. That made her what they wanted to help kidnap Mr. Griffin. She agrees but wasn't quite sure she liked the idea. Everything happens as planned except Mr. Griffen dies. How does he die? Will they get caught and sent to jail?The type of person who would like this book is someone who likes murrder mysteries."
4,WITTY!!,"Let me start off by saying that I am NOT a fan of Gabrielle Union's. In every movie I have seen her in, she's played the role of 'witch.' This movie is beyond the rest. However, LLCOOLJ was in it! So, I decided to give it a chance, and I am very pleased with my decision. This movie was fun, witty, and sexy. A MUST SEE movie. Believe me. I'm a ""hata"" of gabrielle's but this role was MADE for her!! GO BUY THIS MOVIE!"
3,Okay,Not a Great movie but not terrible either.the Characters werent fleshed out enough for me..Seemed very one dimensional..And the script was very far fetched.On the other hand it was cool to see some talented beautiful black actors on screen for a change.
5,Deliver ...,Love it!! I've watched it a dozen times already.Love it!! I've watched it a dozen times already.I have no more to say!
3,I Finished This Game The SAME Day I bought it!!!,"This is way to easy. It took me many months of periodic play to finish Wave Race 64 on N64, but this I beat in one afternoon. That's right, one afternoon! Granted I only spent $*.** for it new, but still I expected more than that. The graphics are pretty and bright but the sound of the jet skis is very annoying and the water is barely affected by your presence. Tracks aren't very challenging and you NEVER fall from your jet ski no matter what you hit. There are barely any control options just throttle and steering. It was pretty fun while it lasted, but with no difficulty setting to up the challenge I recommend that seasoned racers rent this one, or buy it real cheap and trade it in once you're finished (the next day!)."
5,The Human Condition,"This film has brought new definition to our mundane everyday image of our civilization. Allowing us to see humanity from a frightening and alien perspective. This film focuses on the destructive nature of our industries, and the hive like nature of the ideal metropolis.The title of the film, taken from an 11th century Hopi Native prophesy, is the essence of this film itself. A prophetic portrayal of modern man, taken from that very altruistic people that stood victim like no other to manifest destiny and all its destructive nature.This film will frighten you, engage you, and change your world forever."
2,Music video or feature film?,"Having read some other reviews here, I have to agree with their basic criticism. Then again, perhaps this film should not so much be critisised as a feature film, but as a music video, or in fact a video installation that took the wrong door. Watching this as a feature film is unbearable for anyone with a sense of plot. Also, it has so many flashy effects that there should be a seizure warning on the package. But the film certainly goes well as a background for Phil Glass' very enjoyable music, or for running it in the background during a weird, geeky party you are having in an abandoned Detroit warehouse..."
1,"Fantasia was prettier, Beatles cartoon funnier","This is 90 minutes of slooow computer graphics, mingled pretentiously with montages of wax-museum faces, bits of advertising of all eras, still photos of abandoned buildings and of course The Mushroom Cloud! ""Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" I have liked much of the music from Phillip Glass's operas; that's why I bought this disk. I have to say, the visuals here succeed in making Glass's score sound melodramatic, trite, and vapid."
5,Glen campbell at his best,"This album is really a good album to buy , if you are a Glen Campbell fan. He has Alzheimers disease, and this album will always keep Glen alive in our hearts. A nice tribute to Glen and his family, buy it for the memories!!!"
5,glen cambell at his best,"I was living in Ft. Lauderdale when these songs came out. I can't forget the quality of his tone and range,plus he was new to me and he picked-up a new fan and that spilled over to my wife and three daughters. wonderfull voice and good selection of songs,glenn at his best."
4,Great Bible Study Aid,"Lucado is one of my favorite writers as he gives you something to think about and presents the gospel in a manner that makes it seem fresh and new. A story you've heard thousands of times, yet Lucado's storytelling just seems to make the text come alive. Autobiographical? Not really. No Wonder They Call Him the Savior tells the story of Jesus in 33 chapters and a little over 200 pages and full of activities to enhance your biblical studies.The Reader's Guide which follows the last chapter of the book is a perfect study companion. Each exercise included in the Reader's Guide offers practical application, thoughts for conversation and reflection of the chapters.Overall, this is a wonderful read that can be read to enjoy or as a Bible Study aid."
5,Fantastic Book Especially for Lenten Studies,I enjoyed it and wrote a study guide for it. We are using it as our Lenten Bible Study. It's an easy read and a very well written book.
2,Uninspirational,"This book is nothing more than a gratuitous appeal to the emotions, which will not work should you have read and engaged the Gospels on your own terms. Save your money, read your Bible and respond to it as you will. Don't let Lucado tell you how to feel about it or what to think. If you must, allow him to make suggestions, but I sincerely recommend finding something else to spend your money on."
3,DTS Big Band,"Surprisingly good sounding, the arrangements are generally pleasing - more like 3.5 stars. I did notice some noise (like tape noise) during the absence of music but didn't interfere with the music. Something to consider for those that like big band and most definitely Les Brown fans. FWIW."
3,The follow up to Endless Summer,"The Endless Summer double LP greatest hits compellation was such a success that the record company tried this one. However, this one does not hold a candle to the classic Endless Summer. Recommended only to true fans."
3,"Not bad, not great",I am a Christian so I was super excited to do a workout that combined health and faith. Some of this dvd reminds me of P90x in that you have exercises where you log how many reps you did that day and attempt to do more in the following days. It is different from P90x in that you do the same exercises every day for 33 days-which I find a little too boring. I like the guy but he sometimes loses track of time (especially in the abs and stretching section) by talking too much. I am going to give it a full 30 days and see what shape my body is in.
5,"great way to start a fitness goal, simple moves, encouraging words","Needed a fresh perspective. Jimmy is easy to follow and encouraging, too. I like the way he connects the physical and the spiritual"
1,Disappointing,"I'm a Cowboy Junkies fan of long standing but was disappointed with One Soul Now. It is intentionally 'stripped down ' and inward looking' . For that I read a quickie less than full product with even more mellow and depressive lyrics than is there norm. A low wattage effort without an independent production team to edit or spur on or just tell the Junkie Pretty weak- please try harder.. If you are your own editor or producer you are hardly a fair, independent second thought. It shows. Their weakest effort to date.Hope they can rebound with critical producer."
2,why is the logo different? fake or expired product?,"I just bought this shampoo on amazon, because I heard it works well. The logo on the shampoo in the product picture in this link below is suppose to be the official logo. which the two Xs on the shampoo I received is different.http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-VitaTress-Biotin-Shampoo-32/dp/B000N2MZMQ/ref=pd_sim_hpc_9can anyone tell me why the logo ""NEXXUS"" is different than what Nexxus says their official ""Nexxus"" should look like. The product I get does not have 1 ""solid letter X"" on top and ""hollow X"" at bottom. The Nexxus logo on the product I received is just Two X. one on top and one on the bottom.The logo in this link below is different...is the one I got...why is it different?http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-VitaTress-Biotin-Shampoo-Liter/dp/B003C5URYY/ref=pd_sim_hpc_4anyway I can tell how old is the product?Shouldn't logo for a product look the same?DId I get fake Nexxus shampoo ?"
4,good shampoo,"cleans hair great and doesn't require me to have to use a conditioner, my hair is soft, shiny and easy to comb through."
1,Gimme a break!,Gimme a break if you wanna read a good wrestling book read Mankind Have a nice day dont waste your money on this book! She does not tell whole story in her book thinks wrestling revolved around her! What about Mildred Burke and June Byers or Penny Banner!
2,Boxes kinda confuse you,Make sure to type in the number 4 after Uristix if not you'll end up getting the gluco and prot only...
2,"Not very detailed, has some errors, 2007 edition","First, I recieved a newer edition of this atlas (2007). That was good.But after looking through it I found several errors in street names (Duhram instead Dame Rd in Newmarket, Ascension instead Abbey Sawyer Memorial Dr in Dover). And street names are written without St, Dr, Ln or Ave part.Then at Dover Point page it's impossible locate Dover DMV because there is no Boston Harbor Rd in the atlas. Instead of it is shown the route 4.Another error which I noticed is misplacing York's Wild Kingdom to beginning of Animal road instead putting it in the end of it.All town's maps even the smallest ones are divided in 2 to 6 pages which I found not very convenient.So, I'll try to find others more precise atlases or maps of this region."
5,Good cable for the money,I have no complaints about this cable. It works as advertised and at a great price.
3,Unsure,"I only rate this as a 3, so as to stay in the middle. I'm not sure if the cord itself wasn't functioning or if the phones just wouldn't charge, but seeing as I had two of the same exact phones, neither of which would charge with this cord, I'm assuming mine was just a faulty one."
4,Using with a u-420,"This product does not work on its own with my phone. Once I bought this, I had to download bitpim (http://www.bitpim.org) and follow instructions from http://wiki.howardforums.com/index.php/Samsung_SCH-U420 on using it.This cable fits many phones, but for the U420 it only allows serial port connections. If you are not willing to work at it, then don't waste your time.I bought it mainly to add my own ringtones to my phone. Once I uploaded the ringtones and disconnected the phone, I had trouble getting the phone to see my ringtone inside it. I turned the phone off and on and it was there. It has worked fine since that time.I gave it a 4 for the following reasons. Some people may have a hard time with this. It can be complicated, but it worked for me."
1,No Good,"I bought this for my sch-u740, and the plug in does not even fit in to the charger socket! Look at the picture of the plug and compare it to your charger..they aren't the same. Don't buy this if you are looking for a data cable for the sch-u740 model, however there are other ones specifically for that model, just search for them in the search bar."
2,Not well designed,"I am not impressed by this item. It did not fit together well, and does not seem sturdy at all. Its also rather unattractive. I would look elsewhere for a good audio rack."
1,Don't waste your time or your money,"This book simply doesn't live up to all the perfect reviews it received. It certainly will make money for someone, but it probably won't be for you, the reader. It is tiring to see Amazon filled will fake reviews written by public relations firms, agents, friends, and even the authors themselves. Check this book out before you decide to buy it."
1,Stay away from this one,"The guy spent 20 years in Brazil hating it. Why? Because he hated everything about Kansas and had a bitter relationship with his parents, so he might as well have been exiled.One reader said here that he wondered how this got published. Well, Vantage Press is one of those houses that will put out anything as long as the author will pay for it. And there is a disclaimer that takes all responsibility from them. Good.And oh, Ernesto Twegen does not exist. The guy didn't have enough guts to use his real name. Shame. If it weren't for ethics, I would reveal his name. Stay away from the book."
5,Very underated band,Very underated band. Good musician's and good writers. The lead singer was fun to watch and listen to. I especially like the guitar player and drummer.
3,Nice Collection of Songs,"Missing Persons released some pretty good music and this hits album is not a disappointment. Best songs are ""Windows,"" and ""Destination Unknown."" It would be nice if they would re-release the '86 album ""Color In Your Life."" That's got some great tunes on it, and having it on CD would be nice. That aside, this is a good hits collection."
4,Great low-carber snack,"These pop up nicely in the bag, but follow the directions- it's not like popcorn. Be sure to shake the bag before you cook it and try to get all of the ""rinds"" laying flat in the bag before you put it in the microwave. Tastes just like stuff already cooked and in the bag, but kinda nice because it is still warm and crackling. The only down side is that they do not have a low-salt version. This snack is PERFECT for people trying to watch carbs and still get protein."
5,Doublethink,"This interesting snapshot of pre-bellum Southern evangelicalism struck me as less controversial than advertised and, in any case, a telling portrait of the 'actuals' of religion in American history. The parallel appearance of abolitionism and pro-slavery evangelical apologia is a difficult dialectic to reconcile, and the historical image refresh rate is essential for an archaeologist of ideology. One need not undergo a paradigm shift to find this a useful angle on a multidimensional subject, and a shadowy one at that."
4,Trouble with Mary,"If you are a big fan of the Mary Tyler Moore show, these DVD's will give you lots of pleasure and a lot of trouble along the way. I have never had so much trouble with DVDs as I've had with these. I have purchased 6 Seasons of this show and half of them have had defective DVDs inside. In most of them it was Disc #2 which is defective and will not play at all. At other times, a disc will take a long time to load and play. On another disc, half of the disc will play fine and then just stop. This is the only television show that I have had trouble with and I've purchased many TV Shows on DVD so I just want to warn you before you make this purchase."
5,Mary Tyler Moore 1st Season,"Outstanding! After seeing the first season on DVD, you will never want to watch it on Nick At Night again. The DVD has restored the series beautifully and the film has been slowed back down to it's original pace. Episodes are 25 minutes long, without commercials! Many of the punchlines which have been edited out for the sake of a 30 minute time frame on tv have been added back in. I look forward to season two and hope that the rest of the series makes it's way to DVD as well. Great documentary on the making of season 1 on disc 4 and the CBS promo clips are cool to see 30 years later.Thanks!Steve McKinney,Seattle, WA"
5,Looking Back With A Smile On My Face....,"I Enjoyed Revisiting This WONDERFUL Show!!! Terrific Cast And Guest Stars, Great Script And A Great Picture & Sound!!! I Can't Wait For Season Two, Three, Four & So On!!!!!!"
2,"Needed help to put it on, then it fit poorly.","Weird hook--not standard for front-hook bras. Couldn't get it hooked--needed help. Then, it didn't fit--cut the breasts."
2,Unimpressed,I'm not really sure where all positive reviews come from but this bra did not seem worth the $44 price tag. Like the previous reviewer I also thought this bra was lightly padded. The cup fabric is very sheer and stretchy and the bra is not at all supportive. Sending it back.
3,Spencer Davis Group deserves better,"Great group, great tunes, bad production quality on this particular cd. ""Gimme Some Lovin'"" is one of the all-time great tunes to get people partying, but I'd suggest looking for it on another cd, or play this only on a boombox on a crowded beach, where sound quality isn't so important (the sample you hear on amazon is of better quality)."
2,Nice looking but very uncomfotable shoes.,I love kenneth cole brand and my previous shoes were exactly the same but without cords. I spent many months trying to find them until I saw them here and I didn't hesitate to buy them. Now that I have them I barely use them because they are very hard and uncomfortable.
1,Too bad you can't give negatives--I was FORCED to give it 1,"This book is nothing more than a platform for yet one more religious fanatic to cram their philosophies down everyone else's throat. The author pretends she has a topic and a subject but her REAL adgenda is to foist her religious opinions off as fact. Oh yes, everything in your life will be just rosy if pray enough. And if someone in your life is screwed up and treats you like crap, it's YOUR fault because YOU didn't PRAY hard enough. Save your money. This book isn't worth it even if they gave it away. I wouldn't have given it any stars at all, but Amazon.com's script doesn't allow for that much honesty."
2,Not worth it,I have 4 cats but and thought my cats would like it. Only one ate a little. Won't bother getting it again.
3,Disappointed,"It grew easily and even better than the picture.However, my cat never smelle, tasted, or touched it.Threw it out."
2,I'm feeling cheated!! Me siento estafada!,"The appereance is not what you see in the pictures, the quality of the material is not good enough, actually my bag is disjointed!!! I can't change it because i live in Dominican Republic so it's more expensive to send this bag back, but i'm feeling really cheated and dissapointed!!And wath about the contents? The cleaning set is quite small, it doesn't have the quality you can see in the picture, they send you a cheaper cleaning set in a ugly box!!! And the LCD protector?? Just 6!! 6, you know? The only thing thet is actually wath i think is the little and strong table tripod.Veintitres dolares que me dolio pagar. Me parece un producto feo, me siento estafada. La calidad general deja mucho que desear, en especial la tela del bulto. No, no, no!!!"
2,Not convenient design,"I got this bag hoping it would hold my Nikon D50 digital SLR along with my zoom lense and extras, like batteries, cables, and memory cards. I'm a beginning amateur, so I don't have a significant amount of gear, and wanted this bag just for times when I wanted to take everything with me, and for keeping it stored at home. While the size might have been okay, it's still probably a tight squeeze for even my small amount of gear. The problem with this bag though, is there is a lip of fabric that covers the zipper. It is very snug, so to zip and unzip the case you have to fold the fabric up all the way around. No one else mentioned this in the reviews I read, so maybe this doesn't bother other people, but I can't see how it wouldn't. I'm returning this bag and going to look for something less tedious to open and maybe a big larger."
4,Sturdy but small,"Nice strap, sturdy construction. The flap around the zipper can be tedious, but feel like its more of a safety thing, so not complaining about it.Overall I'm pleased with the bag for the equipment I have. However, if I add one more thing any bigger than a lens cap, I'm screwed. I have a Canon XSi w/ kit lens (attached) and a 70-300mm lens; both *just* fit in the main compartment. I also carry my battery charger and extra lens cap, plus my tripod attachment and cleaning rag. It's a tight fit, so if you have more than that, go bigger!Oh yah, the table top tripod is a joke. My camera is way too heavy for it; there's no way I'd sit my camera on that thing! The cleaning kit is nice, especially the LCD protector and rag."
3,FYI - it's a different version,"The main reason I wanted the Fun Pack was for Backgammon. Unfortunately the Fun Pack I received, while having the same name, contains 11 completely different games than the 6 that are listed here. They are: Reptoids, Checkers, Tyranny, Tank!, Salvo, Go Moku, 3D Tic-Tac-Toe, 9 Pegs, X Bomb, Overload and Bio Chart. Tyranny alone makes up for the lack of Backgammon. Tank! can be addictive once you figure out how to play, but Reptoids quickly gets boring."
3,Loved them at first,I've had these gloves for about a year now and I use them for everything. I have two sets of Mechanix gloves and they both suffer from the same problem after continuous use. Basically I the stitching on the fingers falls apart and my index fingers end up being exposed. Maybe I'll try something different this time around.
2,Impact 2 Review,"The fit was perfect, they felt great right off. but after Using the gloves for 20 minutes throwing bricks and rubble around three of the ten finger tip seam's broke apart and I can no longer use them because if I try my fingers will just get cut up...not why I bought these gloves."
5,A Great New Group,"The best music is derivative as well as synthetic...as this is. Easy to listen to, but with layers of complexity. A terrific first album."
3,"Hey! It's Science ""Fiction"". It's supposed to be farfetched","I loved it. O.K it's a little gung ho and Patriotic but that's the point, kind of,. The plot is very cool, the science is good, so to is the premise around which thing is set. The characters are a little Hollywood but then, again it's supposed to be slightly bigger than life.I only gave three stars because i'm not a big ""series"" fan, but having said that i am looking forward to the next chapter!(Now for the sad part... I finished the last half of this book in one spell in the bath during my honeymoon! Now thats gotta tell you something about the book!)Oh. and as for the ""European"" remarks in other reviews, I'm from the U.K. and I liked it.Only ten years ago Britain and America were happily giving arms to most of the middle east countries they now seem to have a problem with. so political alliances can, and will change."
5,Sugarbush Spring,My family has made maple syrup for years. Reading this book I felt like I was back in the woods gathering sap and could almost smell the syrup as it boiled in the pan and taste its sweetness. The pictures are beautiful and the information right on the mark. As syrup making is a family event I will have to buy copies for all of my family.
3,Nice Introduction to Crucial Era,"The cover of this book says it is about ""Jefferson, Adams and the Revolutionary Election of 1800,"" but it is really about the period from 1787 to 1800. Only 50 pages are directly about the election; the other 260 pages are mostly about the period leading up to the election. Still, Weisberger gives a good overview of the crucial period in our country's history from when the national government was created by the constitution until the election of 1800 threatened to undo the Republic. Given the broad scope of the book, Weisberger can't give us a lot of detail in the room allotted. But I would recommend the book as a first step before delving into the details. To those who like hardbacks, the binding is fair and mine has come unglued."
5,GRUB review,"fast service,wonderful book, great memories of "" Food for a Small Planet""Its about time someone thought the way I do !Like new. Would purchase again and again from this seller."
4,Decent Strings,"I am not a guitar player but my teenage son is currently taking guitar lessons using an acoustic/electric and he does occasionally need to restring the instrument. These strings work well for his purposes and have a nice sound to them.Putting these strings on is a no-nonsense affair and was not really any different than using any other strings in the same gauge. There's no real difference here to set them apart.Once strung, these strings produce a nice, crisp and clean sound when played, with just a hint more ""warmth"" than we noticed with other strings. This difference is subtle, but it's there.These are nice strings that produce good sound and are easy to work with."
4,A Feel Good Album,I enjoyed Lennon's homage to early rock and roll gems and this still remains one of my favorite feel good albums. I nearly wore out my vinyl copy of it because I discovered it also made a terrific aerobics/workout collection of music.
3,Could Have Been A Fantastic Album,"The idea of John Lennon singing rock and roll songs from the early days was a natural. When he sang songs such as Dizzy Miss Lizzy, Money, and Twist & Shout when he was with the Fabs, it was always a showstopper. However, with this release, he misses the mark too often. I realize that this was part of a lawsuit settlement and that the behavior of Phil Spector was eccentric at this time. However, the album as a whole sounds buried in sound and reverberation. Also, John does not seem to be putting too much effort into the music. I bought this when it first came out in the 70s and was bitterly disappointed."
2,Christian Propaganda =(,The beginning of the book is fantastic. However be warned that seventy percent into reading everything becomes unrealistic.ALL the characters end up being like the princess: absorbed in God's grace to the point of blindness. This transformation is told unrealistically. Three people in the book give up addictive opiates with no difficulty??? Jesus saves all who call except the bad guys. A godly message is fine all and good but the author should have warned her readers that this book is Christian propaganda with a good beginning and pitiful ending. I was disappointed.
3,Too much Christian preaching for me,"I should have read more of the reviews. I'm not familiar with the author. I didn't realize that this was as religious (Christian) as it is. I never finished it. I loved the first half, but got rather tired of the preaching. Probably read 2/3 of the book and quit. Thank goodness it was a free book."
2,Not what I was expecting,I got this book expecting a medieval historical fiction sort of novel but instead it was a Christian story. I wish the book summary was more clear on the Christian aspect so I knew before that it wasn't my type of novel. The further into the story I read the more the characters mainly talk about God which made for slow plot development. I also felt like the story ended halfway through the novel and the author just didn't know when to stop writing.
2,Strong start; abrupt fizzle,"What starts out as a potentially worthwhile historical fiction tome takes an abrupt detour into a weakly written, boring and relentlessly proselytizing Christian dialogue. The author knows how to grab and pull the reader in. Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to maintain that hold."
1,Hell disguised as a novel.,"This ""novel"" is largely a waste of time. Characters are poorly developed, almost cartoon-like, melodramatic stereotypes. Consider the image of the good guy getting shot in the heart, and then taking 14 minutes (or 22 pages) to die, all the while orating about the grief of living, the ultimate success of ""the good"", the Grace of the Lord, and the price of chopped liver. Tahn suffers to a degree that becomes farcical, all the while denying and seeking God, while the ""Lady"" twit who inspires him comes across as a religious bozo. The plot is a crude morality play, fit for 6th graders, maybe, if one wishes to damage their psyches. Serious Christian questions are answered only on the elementary school level, yet manage to resolve the deepest mysteries and unbelievable suffering of the characters. Pure melodrama, but not particularly interesting. I propose that the greatest suffering about Tahn will be on the part of the reader.Caveat emptor."
2,Misleading...,"I obtained this title as a free Kindle version, the the description sounded quite entertaining; a medieval adventure, of sorts. The story line started out fine, and the characters seemed fitting and likeable enough. THEN, about a third of the way into the story, the author begins to insert Christian inuendo and dogma in an effort to ""convert"" the main character. As the story progressed the religious tone and assertations became quite overwhelming, and totally overshadowed the storyline, itself. While having respect for others' religious beliefs, I cannot stomach having it shoved down my literary throat. All in all, the story was entertaining, but, I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this."
3,started interesting...,"tahn started interesting but about 40% of the way through it had turned into, as another reviewer said, romantic balderdash. It goes from the ordinary medeval girl praying occasionaly to at least three other characters having religious revelations. They all realize they can trust in God and no matter what happens, at least now they can go to Heaven eventually. I don't think I can bear another sentence of this book. I will leave it unfinished."
4,Love it...,"I was given this for my birthday mostly because I'm just curious about everything, it's fantastically easy to use. Although I have noticed that there is at least one plant in my area that is mildly toxic that can easily be mistaken for one of the edibles listed in this. I think if they added notes on edibles that have close similarities to poisonous plants, it would improve the usability vastly."
2,check your copy carefully,"My copy has several blank pages - missing photos, mostly. The content of the book is as advertized, and it will certainly help you to find edible plants - but if you order it, be sure to check for missing pages and plates when you receive it (before the return window expires.)"
2,Good for small batches of fresh pasta,This is a very small tool to use if making large amounts of fresh pasta. Using a large dowel between two chairs or other homemade device would save money.
5,Good read,If you need a good book for learning to live off the land. This a great read. i WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE
3,It's just okay...,"This book is informative which is a plus. But there is not enough colored pictures of most of the plants mentioned which is disappointing. Black and white pictures will not help me out in nature. I am a bit disappointed with this book, since it did have good ratings...I just can't give it more than 3 stars."
2,Slight Disappointment,"I love my Peterson Field guides, but this one just doesn't quite measure up. The layout is kind of confusing and honestly I have a good understanding of some plants being that I am studying to be a Biologist ,but it is very difficult to use if you aren't familiar with plant families."
3,They Missed A Couple!,"Sure the Clash were an excellent band, but this so-called ""essential"" compilation leaves a couple great songs out. Where's ""The Call Up?"" Where's ""City of the Dead?"" Where's ""The Prisoner?"" Where's ""Washington Bullets?"" Where's ""Armagideon Time?"" The point is, either buy their albums, or get ""Clash on Broadway"" which I'm pretty sure has all or most of the above-mentioned songs."
5,The Rug Hooker's Bible,"This is a great, step by step, instructional manual. The directions are easy to understand and the many pictures really show what's supposed to happen. This book has helped me more than the rug hooking classes I've taken."
4,dvd goosebumps,Goosebumps: A Night in Terror TowerThe Goosebumps series have been enjoyed by children/and adults for years.Started buying these for my son and now for his [my grandsons].They enjoy them very much and so do i.A must buy for anyone.
2,"Too Many Tangents, Inconsistent, Ultimately a Let-Down","After much critical acclaim, I could not wait to immerse myself in a book that touted ""great story-telling"". The introduction held much promise, but, produced a book that was impossible to finish. Multiculturalism, is a much touted phrase these days and I feel that Zadie Smith bit off more than she could chew with ""White Teeth"" and took advantage of a trend. Bored to tears, confused and could not wait to unload this novel on a unsuspecting reader."
4,White Teeth and unnerving confidence for no name brit chick,"Stunnin debut, darlin. Unnerving confidence for a Brit chick who`d be a no name at a rock show. Just stay off the yachts away and away from fat men with fatwas and, in principle, Elton John."
1,What a waste,"I bought this book because of positive reviews I had read about it and was utterly disappointed. I stopped reading a little more than halfway though because I did not care what happened to any of the characters. It is impressive for such a young author to have a book published, but unfortunate that the book falls far short of impressing."
3,ho hum,"She writes so beautifully, but I found this book boring enough to just quit, which is unusual for me. She has great, graet potential & I sincerely hope that she will come up with a true masterpiece soon."
3,Boring...,"But it didn't start out that way. A little less than a third of the book is what I was easily able to get through. The writing was very good, it flowed, it was very witty and enjoyable. But once the plot went into one large flashback of the lives of two of the main characters' time in the war I just lost interest. It became pretty boring, almost like someone else had taken over the story and was writing it. I really didn't care about those two characters anymore, I think that flashback really bogged down the story, though it might have been essential to the later plotline, I really don't know now :) But I was bored with it and stopped forcing myself to read. Not my thing I guess."
1,TOOTHLESS,"I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GAVE THIS BOOK SUCH A GOOD REVIEW! OUT OF 12 PEOPLE IN OUR BOOK CLUB, ONLY 1 READ THE ENTIRE BOOK, AND SHE FORCED HERSELF TO DO SO. THIS PERSON TEACHES A BOOK CLASS FOR SENIOR CIIIZENS. WE ARE A VERY DIVERS GROUP WITH PROFESSIONALS VERYING IN AGE FROM 85 TO 24. THERE ARE AT LEAST 50% OF OUR GROUP THAT WOULD READ AN ENTIRE BOOK EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT THIS BOOK WAS NOT WORTH THE TIME OR THE MONEY."
2,Loser Gets Second Chance,"I'm not a fan of books where losers get second chances at life. Had her protagonist succeeded, we all would have had better things to do with our time.Smith can write, but her subject leaves me cold. Would she had left him colder."
3,Not as good as people say,"""White Teeth"" by Zadie Smith is about history, multicultural northern London, gender and the difficulties for people to understand eachother. This could have been an interesting novel but I wasn't too impressed. As there are too many characters figuring in the story I don't feel like I get to know anyone of them properly. They almost turn into stereotypes, unfortunatly. But I think Smith's talent is in her narration, the language is witty and expressive like a painting made by sparkling colors. So I would not be surprised to find better novels by her in the future."
5,Fun to Read!,"The unlikely friendship of Archie and Samad, beginning in the cramped quarters of a WWII tank, makes for a fun and fascinating story. Smith's writing is ironic without being heavy-handed, and is full of observations about the small stuff that makes up our lives. The characters are ones you would invite in for a cup of tea, just to see how things are getting on.Take White Teeth on vacation, and bask in a great read."
3,That's entertainment....,"This is an interesting little book. The end is a bit of a let-down: you get the feeling the author could have gone on and on with these characters' lives, and so at some point she just had to say ""stop"" and her ending was simply the best way she could come up with to stop the action, dead in its tracks.It is a page-turner. And frankly its entertainment value should not be minimized. But even though it has the opportunity to tackle some hugely explosive issues (inter-racial marriage, minority oppression, religious fundamentalism, racism, etc), these things are really glossed over. The characters remain amazingly flat.This is light reading. Good. But very light."
5,Rewarding and compassionate,"I really looked forward to diving into ""White Teeth"" each day on the subway going to and from work. The first two chapters are sensational, and though it's not consistently great, there are many places where it soars. Smith has tremendous compassion for her flawed characters. Just when she seems to be running out of steam in places, she introduces new characters like the incredible Chalfen family, or brings back old ones like Magid, the twin exiled to Bangladesh, whose dialogue with a cockney/Asian bar owner is priceless."
4,Entertaining and Enlightening,"I enjoyed this book, but I will be the first the admit that it is not for the ""light reader."" Being an American, it took me a minute to get used to the English writer's style and use of language. Once I got into her flow, it was smooth sailing. This book is appropriately funny and poignant while remaining totally human. I found myself laughing out loud at times. Each character is developed beautifully and is deliciously flawed. I cared about what happened to each of them in spite of themselves. I love the way the author allowed them to evolve, progress, regress, or just simply be- according to their current circumstance. The main thing I gleaned from this book is that the basic elements of the human condition are the same across cultures, races and classes."
3,Amusing insight into a troubling time,"After the bombings in London were revealed to have allegedly been committed by suburban youth, I felt that I understood the situation better and in more depth because I had read Ms. Smith's tour de force of a debut novel. Witty and entertaining, albeit a little loose and perhaps in need of one more edit, WHITE TEETH reminded me of a Victorian novel with a touch of Tom Robbins thrown in: myriad, seemingly disparate threads come together all tied up in a nice, neat bow at the end. Clever language and interesting characters are icing on the cake."
1,Boooooring,"Did you enjoy ""Satanic Verses""? Well, neither did I. Salman Rushdie gives ""White Teeth"" high marks, so if you thought Satanic Verses was a hoot, I guess you'll like this. Trying to read this was a snore. I skimmed, hoping in vain it would get better. It never did."
1,Boring.,"I always complete a book, ALWAYS. Not this one it's still on my table beside the sofa collecting dust. I tried to get to know the characters, I tried to get into the story...that's just it, I had to try very hard to like this book. One day I just put it down and never went back."
3,"A difficult read, but at times engaging","I almost dropped this book half way through, but forced myself to go on and found that the second half was much better. It is at times engaging and witty, but at other times difficult to follow and even depressing in the description of some of the shabby lives of these people. I did not like the ending. So I enjoyed bits and pieces of it and suffered though the rest. Overall an OK book."
4,"Creative, rollicking, and vast in scope","Zadie Smith's remarkable debut novel shows depth, wit, and most of all, a genuine talent for storytelling. She tackles an important but somewhat timeworn theme--the immigrant experience and all the culture clashes it produces--and turns it into something original and memorable. Smith's ability to weave her characters' personal histories back and forth in time with such ease and aplomb proves that she is clearly a young writer to watch. Archie and Samaad, the two anti-heroes of the story, are flawed and at times, foolish men, but Smith portrays these characters with so much affection and gentle mockery that one cannot help but love them. This book crosses oceans, continents, and several generations, yet it never feels overblown or remote. Smith has an uncanny writer's gift of inviting the reader into the narrative with such intimacy that the obscure becomes the familiar. White Teeth has verve, wit, and panache. Smith's talent is formidable."
2,Un-engaging,I do not find this story or its characters engaging in any way. I cannot identify any unique voice or personality from the author within these pages -- very uncaptivating. I am about half-way through and do not think I will finish. Why is this book so highly regarded?
1,Basic Cop Film... With Porno.,"The lethal weapon films are better cop movies, and the matrix reloaded as a much better car chase(even though this one inspired it alittle, like to going the opposite way on the freeway). Its basically your typical cop movie, this one has pretty lame action, bad acting, no special plot, and no comedy or drama, another flaw is it is borderline porno, there is alot of sex and nudity, totally uneccesary, i hope the french connection proves better when i see it. Since it has nothing special to offer i give it a 2 out of a 10 since it inspired the matrix reloaded's car chase(which is the best one ever) and the ending was an unexpected shock but still pretty lamorama because it was totally underplayed."
3,"Pretty good, not great","This movie is pretty good, but definitely not the 4.5 stars given by other reviewers. William Dafoe is great as usual. The rest of the actors are pretty average. The story is good enough to keep you interested, although the script is pretty trite at times. It's worth watching."
4,Great Movie,"This movie needs no special effects to be great. It has the best car chase ever put on film (apologies to Steve Mcqueen fans). If you loved/liked ""Bad Liutenant"" with Harvey Keitel then you'll love this, and vice versa."
3,so so,"Willem Defoe is always interesting in his roles and the same goesfor this movie. But other actors and actresses seem like B list andthe story line is sort of predictable.I mistakenly thought this movie was another movie I had seen Defoein years back, but the other movie (name I cannot recall) was a much betterflick. Oh well."
3,left and right handles are slightly different,"This may seem picky, but I can't think of a single reason why the mounting screws for left vs right handles are different. Most of your guests won't even notice, but you will... on the left handle the screws are at the surface of the mounting flange, but on the right handle they are inset so that a dark ring shows around them. I wrote the seller about this before ordering, because the pictures ARE different, but got no reply. Sorry if I sound like a perfectionist."
3,"Eh, not what I expected.","It was not horrible, but this movie was really cheesy and had no substantial plot. I was rather disappointed. It was worth seeing but only if you get it for a very low price or catch it on t.v."
3,"Missing something, bu not star power!","This movie was editted, but I got the jest of the director's point of view. The movie centers around Adrien Body's character who has just been dumped. He is a beginning screenplay writer who works at a restaurant to pay the bills until he is successful. All the character's work at the restaurant. They vary in races and the premise is how they get along with each other.They movie is okay. I love Adrien Brody, so it was no big deal to watch him. He is a great actor and this role fit him. Elise Neal did a great job as a aspiring singer and his love interest. They movie was good, but not great. It lacked something, that I can' quite put my finger on. It had enough stars with Simon Baker, Lauryn Hill, Brody, and Neal, but something was missing. It is a movie I will watch again."
5,This book has been my fertility bible - GREAT!,"I have a one year old daughter who took awhile to conceive. My doctor had told me that I could have a difficult time conceiving. The book made it so much easier and less frustrating, as soon as I got it. I read the book cover to cover, then continued each day to reference issues that I had. The book made me so aware of my body and how I can really make it work for me - or at least understand it. Now, I am trying to conceive my second child. The book is again,at my bedside. I flip through the pages daily with any questions I have. It is a great resource!"
5,"This is ""the"" book to read if you are trying to get pregnant","This book is the best book to read if you are trying to get pregnant, or if you are not trying to get pregnant. It contains information in it that you will not hear from your doctor, information that you don't even know about. After reading this book, it all made so much sense to me, and I felt like I understood so much more about pinpointing ovulation. I have recommended this book to so many friends and family and would recommend it to women who have given up all hope, even the women who have been to fertility doctors for years. Don't give up until you read this book. It was the answer to my prayers."
3,Good basic information,"Good basic and detailed information for those not familiar with the workings of their monthly cycle. Some parts I disagreed with, like when Ms. Weschler complained that one of her clients had to endure a ""traumatic, humiliating and painful"" colonoscopy because of the ""ignorance of her medical practicioner"". The woman had mistakenly confused her vaginal fluid with a possible problem with her intestinal tract. Since physicans can only give a diagnosis as good as the information we provide them, I think we all have a responsibility to know how our bodies function. If you don't, this book will help you."
5,The BEST book ever!,"I highly recommend this book for every woman! I bought this book because a friend of mine told me about. She told me that every woman should own it and I have to agree with her! The information in this book is so helpful in understanding exactly what your body is going through every month. It completley explains your cycle and the FAM method. Everyone that I know that has used this method to aquire pregnancy has succeeded! Again, I must say that this book is a MUST HAVE!"
5,It Works!,"This book was a great help. We were able to conceive the first month I used these methods. Unfortunately, I did miscarry at 5 weeks, but will be using the FAM method as before, as soon as we are able to try again."
5,Taking charge of your fertility,"I wrote in a few months ago. My husband and I had just starting charting after seven months of trying. We got pregnant the second month of charting, nine months after we started trying. I give most the credit to this book, I also tried the Robitusin that Toni suggested, I guess it worked! We are expecting in August 2000."
3,"OK, but not for women struggling with infertility",This book is extremely informative IF you function like most women. The problem was I bought it to help with infertility and it is written more for those who seem to be super fertile.
5,Highly recommend this book - it worked!,"I must admit, I hadn't really read the book thoroughly. I was skimming through certain parts and read the section on changes in cervical fluid and body temperature. I half heartedly told my husband that according to the book and if it's right, I'm ovulating and we tried to conceive during those few days. To my surprise and shock, we were successful in the first month of trying! As I write this review, I'm 8 months pregnant with my first baby and I'm 39 years old. So obviously, I'm not as fertile as a younger woman would be. My menstrual cycle is not your typical 28 day so don't believe anyone who tells you to try on the 13th, 14th, 15th day after your first day of menstruation. Everyone's cycle is different and this book will help you understand your cycle and what your ovulation period is for the particular month you're trying to conceive."
5,This book was a God-send,I bought this book after it being recommended by my dear friends at Pregnancy Today Online. I have been trying to get pregnant for the past 8 months. This book told me many things I didn't know including how to better time things for the best chance of getting pregnant. I recommend this book to anyone trying to get pregnant. Toni writes this book in a way that anyone can understand. TCOYF is the bible for anyone trying to get pregnant.
4,Informative and Easy to Follow,"""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" is informative and easy to follow. While reading I wondered why this information had never been discussed with me. Through discussing the variations in each woman's cycle it answered most of my questions that had been previously brushed off with ""oh, that's normal, nothing to worry about."" A must have for everyone woman as soon as possible."
5,I'm Pregnant,"Without the knowledge that this book gave me on how to read and understand my cycle, it may have taken my dear husband and I longer than one month to get pregnant. We knew exactly when to baby dance because of my charting....it worked!"
1,Not the best design,"I tried these on two different cars and several tires leaked down over a couple of weeks. My first suspicion was these valve caps which turned out to be correct after I sprayed a mixture of soap and water on the caps. There was a very slow leak around the cap seals.Sorry, but this product is a terrible idea because it permanently opens your valves. That's just asking for a leak to occur due to leaking seals, sun-cracked valve housing, etc.The in-tire pressure system may be expensive but at least it doesn't cause a leak in your tires."
1,Tire pressure valve cap review,"Well, I had high hopes for this product, but they have failed miserably. I read the other reviews and figured I would still take chance on them. I was wrong. I have had them installed for 2 months or so. All this time, they have shown full green. They are the 32 psi models and I run my tires at 34 psi. I decided over the weekend to remove them and check my pressure to see if they were actually working. The first tire I checked with my digital gauge had a pressure of 22.5 psi. And the green was showing full before I removed the valve cap. I took them all off and tossed them in the trash. I will stick to the old fashioned way from now on."
4,No CGI but good writing,"First, many years ago I rented Pontypoon and on one hand was frustrated that it seemed like a play that was made into a movie, and that was the case.Second, there arent many special effects like one would see in Independence Day.Third, I feel the writing was great because it didnt leave any holes and tied the mystery of where these people disappeared to through clues throughout the movie.There are many low budget movies that have excellent writing that are being made. I rented another one recently (I forgot the name), which didnt have alot of special effects, but it was great drama.I would put this under excellent written horror drama, without the special effects. It doesnt have a big budget. So if there are any people proclaiming no one told them, then they didnt read this review."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This is one of those awesome movies where they build up a feeling of dread of what is about to happen then you find out that what happened is you just wasted over an hour of your life. As you follow the characters along, you know that something big is about to be revealed only it really never is. A monster you never really see, a story that's never really explained and the spots in between filled with girl drama. When you watch this movie and you are half way through and you can't figure out how some people temporarily escape from the monster we never get to see, don't worry it won't be explained later on in the film."
2,Problems in Kindle version,"I have read many of the Nina Reilly books in paperback and hardcover and enjoyed them. Reading the Kindle version of Move to Strike has been rather jarring, as the spaces that are used in the print version between episodes in a chapter involving changes in location and/or characters are not included (not a single one!). Considering that the Kindle edition is not cheap, I feel this needs to be addressed. If you are thinking of buying the Kindle version, be warned!"
3,samurai lizard,the authors' elliptical style and imprecise descriptive flourishes detract from an interesting double murder plot. a romantic element derails the pacing and a sugary ending completes the trivialization.
2,not satisfied,"It was missing worksheets and the CD that are used in my class. I would not recommend buying it from Amazon, it would have been better to spend the extra money and buy it from the college."
3,great,i got my iterm the way i wanted it even though it was misssing the other part of it am still ok with that.
3,King Kong with Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange,"I was a little disappointed when I saw the disc. It had a two or three light scratches and was worried it wouldn't play well.It did play without a glitch so in the long run considering it is a used DVD I am satisfied with the delivery time, price and service."
4,a movie David Lynch might have made...,"this Norwegian movie keeps the viewer guessing, ""is this real or immagined?"" as the plot takes on twists and turns as a simple elevator ride becomes a seductive invitition for John. With chilling eroticism and suspense, this creepy thriller unravels John's untapped desire."
2,Didn't like it,First of all I don't like reading. I can read just fine and maybe I'm lazy but I don't like having to have my eyes fixed on the screen reading sub-tiles. If I turn my head I might miss what is going on. Give me dubbed me any day. At least that way I can hear what is going on. Second to prove I don't read much this is NOT a horror film. That is why I bought it. I should have read reviews. (I'm bad) Third I'm not into weird twisted plots with sex themes. It's not my thing. So it any of what I didn't like about it IS your thing thing then a person might like it. Like I said not my thing.
5,Zeke rules!,"Zeke rules and everything they do is great. I don't care if the sound quality on this album ain't perfect, I crank it loud! Zeke can do no wrong in my book and if you're a hardcore fan then you have to get it! ZEKE WILL ALWAYS RULE!"
1,Total Disgust,I found the quality of the product to be far below average. I have been completely unable to play the puzzles because when it opens I was unable to activate the puzzles. The sound track repeated the thumps over and over and my cursor was frozen. I went through the entire Troubleshooting process to no avail. I feel I wasted my money. I have found to be unsatisfactory.
1,CAN YOU SAY PREDICTABLE?!!!!!,"Ok, for all you kids who have not read the Goosebump Series (A small minority!) DON'T!! The first book sets the patteren for all the other 50 to come. Normal kid(s), something strange happens, crazy ending, etc, etc, etc. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!!! Like every kid who moves into a new house moves into a huge old mansion in a old town that's haunted by freaks! And why do they have to kill the family dog? Because animals always know the truth? If you ask me, the family is pretty clueless about the haunting. There is no plot!! Sure, this series get kids who have never read a book for pleasure in their lives to read, but they're like a Kinder Suprise. At first, the chocolate tastes good, but when you get to the center of this hollow toy (and book) you find nothing more than a cheap piece of junk in substitute for a toy. All of the books in this series are hollow, with no moral value. DON'T READ THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! END"
3,Eighth book in the series,"After reading 8 books in this series, I am becoming a bit weary. Some of the characters seem one-dimensional and the predictable crises somewhat formulaic. However, something keeps me buying the next book just to find out whether the characters change and develop some and I love reading about Arizona place names, restaurants, mountains, and events."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"This book is absolutely beautiful. Just like new -- filled with nice ""crisp"" pages and beautiful pictures. It is a treasured part of my book collection."
5,Sagan is the messiah of marketing astronomy,"After having just watched the movie, ""Mission to Mars"" it is obvious the Sagan's impact on scientific popular culture is growing exponentially. Movies such as Contact, Armageddon, Deep Impact, and even (regrettably) Rocketman, have been shaping public perception of our species future in space. I believe Sagan has been responsible for this recent explosion in the interest of space. Of course I realize the findings of the ""supposed"" fossilized Mars life has played a huge part in this as well. Sagan is magnificent in his ability to pull the reader in and open his/her mind to the truly important things in life - truth, discovery, and skepticism. This book is a truly a steeping stone in our pursuit towards the ultimate question - where are we going? Space the final frontier."
3,Missing one important tool,"This kit has everything you need to rekey a home lock EXCEPT for the cylinder cap removal tool. This tool is not needed for the knobs but is needed for the deadbolts. Since nearly all homes have deadbolts on the outside doors, you will want this extra tool.As another reviewer commented, you can make do with just pliers and a bit of patience, but the tool does make things easier. Since the tool by itself usually sells for $25-$30 it might make more sense to go for the larger Schlage 40-132 keying kit which includes this cylinder cap removal tool.Otherwise, these keying kits are a no-brainer and a must-have. The last time we asked a locksmith to match our locks, he rekeyed just two and charged us $150. This kit paid for itself halfway through the very first rekeying that we did!"
5,Twins,"I recently purchased 2 of these beds for our twin boys, it was very easy to assemble, just be sure that you assemble the item in the room it will be placed in....It's very large once assembled....lol, we had to take it apart to get it in the bedroom, we called ourselves trying to asseble it as a surprise to the children while they were sleep, instead my wife and I were in for a surprise, lol.....very sturdy material though"
5,bedtime with Thomas,"I got this bed for my child because ALL my children LOVE Thomas the Train! I have seen this bed on many different websites, but of course Amazon was the cheapest. Well I got the boxes in the mail, and they were VERY badly damaged, so I opened them up to see if all the parts were still in the box. Thankfully they were, I assembled this bed in my garage since it was a Birthday present for my child and me and my husband wanted a BIG REVEAL.....This bed has worked PERFECT.......the only downside is that it NEEDS a sheet of plywood.....that SHOULD come with the bed, or the bed should be made differently, however.....my child is in LOVE with this bed and i am so delighted that it was simple to put together, it is DURABLE and LOTS of fun!!"
4,My son loves his Thomas bed!,"My 2 year old son adores Thomas and friends! We recently bought him this bed and he loves it! My son thinks he is a big boy because he has a ""choo choo"" bed."
2,poor sound attenuation,"These headphones do have satisfactory sound quality and are pretty comfortable. However in terms of sound attenuation they are very inadequate for my application, which is operating a tractor and bushhog on my farm. Previously I had used a headset radio with good sound attenuation, and if I wanted to listen to music I would use earbuds under the headset and my Ipod. I hoped to replace this system as the earbuds are a bit annoying. Unfortunately the Sennheiser headphones are so poor at sound attenuation all I can hear is the racket I'm creating with the machinery, and so have returned to the previous system for this application. If I were attempting to screen out lower level noise they might be alright, but for my purposes were not the right choice."
4,Pleased for first pair,"Great buy, especially for first time purchasing. A coworker has the much nicer model, approximately $225 in price. These sound just as good, but they do make your ears sweat somewhat. The [much] more expensive model will not do that."
3,Sennheiser HD-280,"Sounds quality is great and the headphones are comfortable to wear. However, the adjustable headband slips when the phones are taken off, so I'm constantly having to readjust the fit."
5,Great sound and hardware for $100,"I highly enjoy these headphones. The sound quality is very good, very clear with solid bass. Not a HUGE bass pair of headphones, which is usually what drives the cost up, but who needs that? For $100 you have a great pair of headphones that are also durable. Recommended to me by a DJ friend, and I would recommend them to anyone."
2,Almost made it!,"They may not have the warm, rich sound quality of the HD-555's, but they are much clearer & more detailed. The problem is with the fit. I understand these are DJ headphones, but these are much tighter (& heavier) than you'd expect. Even at low volumes, using these for as little as 20-30 minutes is enough to give someone a headache. Good sound at a good price; if you have a head the size of a softball, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these."
4,Nice product,I am not a pro on evaluation this kind of devices. I wanted something that wouldn't be cheap but at the same time didn't want to go all the way up where good quality stuff takes you. For the price it is a very decent set. I am satisfied with the purchase.
2,Disappointed,"Even at the Amazon discount price, this product has proven to be a disappointment. The sound quality is mediocre. The headphones cannot duplicate the deep basses of even a moderately priced speaker system. The sound is comparable to AM radio.Also, I agree with the comments that this product is uncomfortable to wear.I personally recommend to buyers to keep shopping. I believe there is a reason why this product is deeply discounted."
2,"Big, heavy & uncomfortable","I bought these headphones and they are huge. They feel like your wearing a brick. They sound decent but should sound much better for the price they are sold at. I think that these headphones were not made to the greatest standards by a company who normally makes high quality headphones. They do have an upside, they are durable and can withstand a beating aka traveling. They play audio at at good intrevals from high, medium and low without being scratchy or too heavy on the bass. For these to sound good, you do need a high quality audio source, mp3 players might not cut it, and computers may sound amplified through these headsets. The ear cups are full cups and quiet but due to air and sound mixes they give ear fatigue fast. So if you have time pick what you want, but not these. Others sound better."
1,JUNK!,"I'M IN THE PROCESS OF SENDING THIS BACK.THE BASS IS TREBLY-IT SKIPS.THE BASS IS EXTREMELTY BAD.WITHOUT THE BASS-IT SOUNDS TINNY,LIKE A BUNCH OF AIR IS INSIDE THE HEADPHONES.PLUS IT HAS A CHIRPING SOUND AND A CRACKLING SOUND."
2,very disappointing,"After reading the reviews here, I bought these headphones, because they seemed like a good value. I would say that the clarity is rather good, and for high-end and midrange sounds, they sound pretty good.On the downside, they were initially so tight that they made my head hurt from wearing them. Luckily, they have loosened up over time, but my biggest beef is that they have basically nonexistant low-end. Some of the music I listen to is bass-heavy, and I simply can't hear tones below a certain point that are clearly audible in other headphones and speakers.I replaced a much cheaper pair of headphones that I bought almost 8 years ago, whose plastic frame just broke on me (they still worked fine), and those sounded better than these.I consider these a waste of money, because 75% of my music sounds great, but the other 25% is basically unlistenable."
2,Grado 60 is much better than this headphones,"My Grado 60 is more than 17 years old. The Grado 60 has clearer high, more natural mid, deeper low and richer sound stage than this new Sennheisher 280 Pro I received today. The 280 does have better isolation due to enclosed design. That isolation also comes with a price, it get hot very fast while I can listen to the Grado 60 for over an hour without notice any heat or fatigue on my ears. I had my wife and son listen to both on various songs, with the volume lower on the Grado since that headphone is more sensitive than the 280, we have no doubt the Grado 60 is much better sounding than the 280 after 3 minutes.The Grado 60 cost me 69.00 years ago and it is still selling at that price, cheaper than the 280 on special sale. If you want to buy this unit, you owe yourself a listen to the Grado 60 first."
2,"good sound, not durable",I have no complaints about the sound quality of these headphones. It is a pity though that they were not made to last - after only about 3 years of light office use the plastic shielding on the cable shows signs of cracking and the leatherette cushion on the headband has fallen off. The headphones still sound good though.
2,The paint flakes off and they crush your head,"If you've a slightly large skull, you'll find that these crush your cranium. I've also had a pair for about five or six years and the paint is starting to disintegrate and flake off the cushions. No big deal, right? Well, the black paint then coats your hair, your ears, and your cheeks. And then the foam cushions start to wear down.After about a year of using these all the time, the head-crushing sensation went away, but the flaky paint remains.However, the audio is great. Not quite as deep and full as I'd like, but excellent enough on low volumes such that I don't hear my officemate enter the room. Or my boss. Always awkward. If you can manage to receive these as a gift or on sale, great! Don't pay full price for them; they don't last."
2,"Good sound, but very tight on head","I bought these to use when studying. While the sound quality is excellent, if I wear them for a long time, the area around my ears begins to hurt and I get a slight headache. I am actually looking to replace these for the hours I have them on.If anyone has a recommendation for a reasonably priced set with good sound quality and a very comfortable fit, please send me a message. thanks!"
3,Ok for the money,"I bought these headphones to be able to hear individual parts of songs to perform in church. As a band director, the good news is I enjoy great sound. The bad news is not being able to afford the sound quality I want. The sound is pretty balanced across the pitch ranges, I feel the sound is compressed with regards to ranges causing a lack of providing detail and presence. They are probably some of the best in the price range, but .... Build seems pretty substantial for the money, comfort is a plus. I think they are a good buy, worth the amount paid. I would hope that someday I will upgrade, I will definitely check out Sennheiser."
4,Very Good Headphones,"Seinnheiser HD-280 headphones are very good, I've only used them for 5-hours so far before my son borrowed them indefinitely to use with his keyboard. The sound is very good for the music I enjoy (latin mostly), like the over-ear design. Quality and comfort are okay, after an hour or so began feeling uncomfortable, but I think it's because they still need to be broken in. It's a tight fit, and many reviewers expressed concerns with crack forming on plastic support, hope that does not become an issue for me."
4,Very nice sound but...,"These are ideal headphones for someone whos looking for great quality sound. These even cancel noise better than the Bose Quiet Comforts 2. My only concern for them was the weight. After a while of wearing these headphones I noticed my neck was getting very tired. Plus the wire is very long and curly which can become annoying at times, but overall I recomend these headphones."
5,Excellent noise isolation and sound quality,"This is an excellent headphone for studio monitoring and also for traveling. The sound is very clear and balanced. I think the sound quality is slightly better than my Sony MDR-V6. It closes around the ears to provide good noise isolation that I found was much better than the active noise-cancellation units, e.g. from Bose. The only drawback is that it fit rather tight for my head and becomes uncomfortable after a few hours."
1,"not comfortable, average sound quality","The headphone is not very comfortable to wear, at least for me. Maybe this is just personal preference, but before buying it online, you'd better try it somewhere in a real store. The sound quality is just so so."
1,Right headphone stopped working almost immediately,"I bought these for my daughter, who loved them for a couple of weeks and then didn't love them after the right side of the headset stopped generating any noise whatsoever. This happened outside the 30-day return window, so I'm going in digital circles trying to figure out how to get a repair or replacement. Wish me luck."
4,Solid,"I wanted sound quality and noise insulation for listening to music on the subway or maybe even at the office.The sound is great, the noise insulation is solid, but the design could have been more size concious.The size profile of the head band seems as it if were designed to go over a football helmet as need be so it takes up significantly more room than necesary even on my large noggin.Happy with my purchase. If I were the engineer, I would have done a few small things differently."
4,Good not Great!,"I bought these headphones as a result of reading many positive reviews. I had it delivered as described and as soon as I put it on i realized it was a bit bulky and makes the user look a bit funny when worn cos it was real wide. I guess it's natural for a closed earphones. It tends to slip off your head when you lean back cause of the smooth top padding. This top padding also gets quite a bit annoying during a long use cause it puts pressure on the head. But enough about the physical aspect. The sound on these are great, the bass is wonderful and full (not too much and not too little - just the right amount). Treble is good but the mid range could be better. I've had to take off the headphones and look around several times cause I thought I heard sounds around me when they were actually coming from the headphones. Overall the headphones are great but I just wish they were as comfortable to wear as a Bose headphone."
3,"great sound, but poor comfort","First off, the sounds is great. After listening to this, I realize how poor by other headphones are.However, be prepare to live with the following:- While wearing these headphones, you might not notice any otherside sounds. If you're wearing them at work, like I do, be prepared to get ""spook"" by visitors behind you.- The headband is *very* tight. I guess it's ok if you have a small head. But for me, the plastic pieces on the headband already starts to break after 6months or so... I guess my head is just too big for it.Overall, the cans sounds great, just wish it was more comfortable like the HD570"
4,Great headphones for an even greater price.,"Not much to say other than they fit and sound awesome. My only complaint is that the earcups aren't made out of the best material out there. After taking them off after a few hours they feel sweaty. To make up for this they made the earcups removable to put your own on, preferably mesh cushions instead. Amazingly priced. Awesome deal. If you're on a budget buy these!"
2,Terrible product,"Sennheiser makes good things, but not this one. Sound is okay, but they are stiff and TOO TIGHT. Oh, my Gosh, my hat size is only 7-1/8.I returned it."
4,Wonderful Sound,"I bought these cans all the way back in January, but thought I'd make a review now since I've nothing better to do.The sound from these headphones is great. I use them to listen to primarily Rock, Classical and some Metal. I don't know much about headphone lingo, but I know they sound crystal clear with anything I throw at them.The only complaint I have is the headband build quality. Over the past 10 months, the band has cracked a considerable amount. It's no big deal though, since Sennheiser offers a great 2 year warranty that I plan to take advantage of soon.."
5,Senheiser HD-280 pro headphones,"These headphones do not disappoint. I pulled them out of the package and was glad to see how sturdily built they are. They sound great, with good, crisp highs and lows. A good burn in will improve the bass alot. The noise cancelation with these is great and they dont leak much at all unless you crank them up insanley high. You might find them to be a bit tight, just break them in. These are great quality headphones for the price!!"
2,"mediocre sound, poorly constructed, very uncomfortable","When new, these headphones crush your head to such an extent that wearing them for more than a half hour is a real test of will. After a few months the cheap, flimsy plastic headband will splinter apart with spider-webbed cracks and this will make them more comfortable until the headband completely disintegrates. Also these are overpowered with bass -- much more so than my old sony v600 (which I could wear for 4+ hours in perfect comfort, and which I believe had significantly more accurate sound reproduction, despite what the anal-retentive ""audiophiles"" claim). At half the price these would be a ripoff. You don't realize how important comfort is until you don't have it."
3,not sure...,"I ordered these and a pair of the Sony MDR-XB500 40mm XB Diaphragm Driver Extra Bass Headphones. I sent these back because compared to the Sonys, they sounded tinny. But I am not an experienced headphone listener - and I know these levels even out with use. In any case, the Sonys were also more comfortable and half the price ($41 vs. $80)."
5,Best bang for your buck,"The headphones are ridiculous.. I bought some about a year ago and I listen to them EVERYDAY! I've put these things through hell and they sound just as good today as they did when I bought them (refurbished) a year ago. I've also got the HD202's, but these are 10x as comfortable and worth every penny extra you pay. When it comes to good headphones I would strongly recommend saving up your money and getting these things.Oh, and don't think the extra $100 for Bose headphones means they are better. The sound quality of these headphones, in my opinion, are MUCH better. So there is my 2 cents, do with it what you will..When it's all said and done, you will realize why I made a special effort to come back to this website just to tell the world how awesome these headphones are!"
2,Compare them to other quality headphones first,"These headphones are incredible for some details in certain types of music (and great for sound isolation), but I had to rate them a 2 because they simply don't hold up overall when compared to other quality headphones. For me, they sound small and deeply recessed, especially in the mid highs and mid bass ranges.You can get used to them and enjoy them by themselves, but as soon as you hear another pair of closed phones right before or after, you realize how small and tinny the sound quality is. Go to an audio store; many will have this pair along with a few others that are also closed; try them all and you'll hear what I mean. I ended up replacing these with a pair of Audio Technica es7's."
5,"Finally, headphones made well.","After blowing a lot of money on Bose headphones, these really are well designed, well made and perform better.Bose appear to be designed to last about a month or two."
3,"Excellent Sound and Value, but Uncomfortable","These headphones perform wonderfully, especially considering their low price. I have listened to rock, pop, country, and classical music, and these phones have sounded great in all genres. However, after extended wear, they began to cause me outer ear pain where my ear touched the interior part of the headphone. I have since switched my primary headphones to the Sennheiser PX100."
4,Great Value,"I've read reviews saying these headphones are uncomfortable, but i disagree. In my opinion theres excellent sound quality and little to no sound pouring out whilst wearing them."
1,Didn't get my money's worth,"Considering the fact that I've purchased headphones from Sennheiser before, I had no qualms about buying a new pair from them this time. However, not even a month after buying these headphones, the cord leading to the right earcup went dead.So I got maybe a month of use from them and had to trash them; It was money wasted. Will I ever buy from them again? Maybe, but next time I'll make sure that the cords are replaceable.Sennheiser HD 202 Dynamic Headphones"
1,Sennheiser HD 202,Broke in less than one year of occational use. The sound was ok when it worked. I have expected much more from a brand like Sennheiser.
5,Love these headphones,"I owned a previous version of these Sennheiser headphones, which have served me for about 5 years now before one side burned out. These new ones actually sound better in my opinion, particularly in the bass response.Fantastic sound, and for the price they blow away Sonys and others that cost more away performance wise. For what I use them for (iPod, Pandora, etc) they work perfectly!"
4,"Great Value, Small Drawbacks","Great sound for the price. Headphones fit well around the head and the sound is immaculate with outstanding bass.Only 2 drawbacks. First, and more significantly, the phones are a bit too warm on my ears - not to the point of serious discomfort, but just below. Occasionally feel like I'm about to break out in a sweat while wearing the headphones. Second, the long cord, while good for flexibility, is inconvenient to deal with when you just want to walk around with your player in your pocket - too much cord to simply stick in your pocket comfortably and the belt clip storage wrap is a non starter with me - too plastic and pocket protector reminiscent.Overall, though, outstanding value for a serious audio product."
4,"Great quality, GREAT price","This has been my first pair of Sennheissers, therefore my first pair of serious headphones, I have to say the quality comparison with other headphones I've had (Philips, Jwin, Coby) is extreme, these are miles ahead from any of those, and the good thing is that they cost almost the same!It has a good bass, and a volume I didn't expect without losing much quality, they fit comfortably, but get a little uncomfortable after an hour or so.Bottomline, this is a great entry level headphone for anyone wanting Sennheiser quality without going to the more expensive models, you get what you pay for and more. Believe me once you test these you will never buy another brand, I know I won't, i'm sure my next buy (when these are gone) will be an upgrade to one of the more professional models."
2,Two Stars for the Two Years They Lasted Before Dying,"These are really great sound-quality headphones! Only problem is...they died after two years of light use. So, I'm giving them 2 stars for reliability. I sure wish reviewers would update their reviews periodically so we can learn more about an item's reliability and endurance over time."
2,Average product,"Sound is strictly ok. Cannot wear phone for long time, as it is uncomfortable to the ear."
1,Painful fit,"Sound is pretty good and if you have a small head you can ignore the cheap plastic construction. If you are an adult with a normal head size, forget it."
1,9 months,"As another reviewer stated, one of the wires came out of the earcup and no longer functions.This was after 9 months of nominal intermittent usage -- 2 year warranty, who sends a $28 set of headphones out for repair? I'm going to avoid the brand just for this reason; I'm sure higher end stuff is fine, but I had a set of sony earbuds that I beat on for years before this happened . . .Not sure where to next."
2,Good Headphones... for 13 weeks.,"Price is right, number of stars for how many reviews is impressive, the sound quality just using them on a Motorola Droidis exemplary... One major problem: 13 weeks into their usage, the right channel stopped working. Tested the set on multiplejacks, narrowed it down to the headphones and not the devices I was testing them on (had a second pair of HP's just to double check). 13 weeks of use for approximately $35? No thanks. I like more value for my money."
1,WILL BREAK IN RIGHT EAR after ~6 months!,"Both my brother and I had a pair of these, and both our headphones stopped working in one ear after about six months. If you don't mind being part of Sennheiser's planned obsolescence scheme, however, these are a great buy."
2,Average sound and horribly uncomfortable - returned immediately.,"I made a huge mistake by ignoring some of the reviewers complaining about comfort, just because many others didn't. But these are extremely tight. Now I would have been prepared to bear this pain, if the sound was great. But sadly, the sound quality is average. I have a pair of Takstar TS-411 headphones that I got for free with my guitar amp. They cost around $6-7 and so, seeing as these were $[...], I hoped for a big improvement in sound. But no matter how much I wanted to, I couldn't tell any difference. I had to return them and suffer a $[...] shipping cost. I say don't buy these."
5,Biggest bang for the buck,"I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate a good sound quality. I bought these headphones for cubicle use in the office, and I mainly listen to pandora or napster. My music genre ranges form jazz, alternative to hiphop, and they all sound great on these. Wow these headphones are great as compared to other headphones i got from 30-50 dollar range, considering I got these for less than 20. My office mate has those bose earphones, they're the same sound quality IMHO, and he said those earphones doesn't stay in your ear for a long time. Thses phones are comfortable to wear for hours. I ended up bringing em' home for listening to music and playing games on my desktop."
5,just what i wanted,These headphones sound great and fit great. I bought them to use during exercising and boy they really make a workout a lot easier. I just can't believe the clarity of these headphones.
4,Best for your money!,"This is fantastic set of head phones. I am a frequent traveler, and do not like having any thing in my ears or around. Sound quality is great. My only complaint is noise canceling is just OK, said, that they were never advertised to have noise canceling capability."
2,Terribly uncomfortable.,"I have used these headsets for about 8 months now and while they are some of the best sounding headsets I have ever owned they are by far the most uncomfortable I have ever worn. If I wear them for more than an hour or so I start to get terrible pains in my ears, totally unacceptable IMO. Other than the pains they're great. Only $20 with shipping, a long cord with a device to store the extra length, decent build quality and they have good sound for the price. However the pains are getting on my nerves so I am probably going to invest in the Motorola Bluetooth headsets I see on Amazon, only $30 and I can eliminate the cord. I will keep these headsets for back up's. So if you're going to buy them try wearing them for awhile when you get them, if they hurt you I hear Amazon has a great return policy."
4,Nice Headphones,"they are a nice pair of headphones! very comfortable, the sound quality it's very good, they have a very long cord, and also they came with an adaptor! the only thing that i didn't like is that the quality of the bass sound is not as good as I expected. but for the price... you're getting the best!"
4,I love this headphones,"I have been using this since 2008 and i just love them.. The sound quality is excellent and crisp. I love the bass on it too. Its comfortable and can stay on for hours without much of a discomfort. The long cord was a great thing as i could move freely about my room without having to take it off :) I compared this with my friend's Bose headphones and actually dint notice much of a difference!! I would recommend this to anyone for all round use like music, movies, web chat etc..."
4,Very Satisfied,"I have had these headphones for about a month and I have been very happy with them. The sound is great, long cord is very convenient, and the price was great. This is the first pair of quality headphones have purchased, and I can't believe what I was missing. I gave the comfort four stars only because they get a little irritating after I listen to them for an hour or so. This is a long time and I think most would get a little irritating after that long of use."
2,For those with large heads ...,"I suggest you do not buy these if you have a large head due to either excessive brains (according to me), or a thick skull (according to my wife). They are painfully tight and non-adjustable for width. They sound great, but I can only wear them for 10 minutes before they start to hurt."
3,I wish I could give two seperate reviews...,"The sound quality of the headphones is worth five stars(*****). The comfort of the headphones is a one star (*). I love the sound, tight & full bass & crisp highs, but the skull crushing grip mentioned by other reviewers cannot be overlooked. It can get really uncomfortable for sure."
2,Good audio & cheap but uncomfortable,"Overall, I wouldn't recommend these headphones. The sound is great and they look pretty cool, but their too uncomfortable. It's not that the headphones are tight, it's that the cups aren't deep enough so extended listening can hurt a little. I've found if you don't constantly adjust the headphones you can't notice the discomfort. I recommend bending these phones to loosen them up on your head."
4,headphone review,"The sound from this headphone is awesome. I listen at work, and the headphones drown out almost all of the nearby talking. They are a little tight on the head, especially if you wear glasses, but I would definitely buy them again."
1,Didn't last 6 months,"I purchased these headphones in Dec. 2009. I use them EXCLUSIVELY at my desk at work. Each night when I'm done, I place the headphones in my desk, cord wrapped around the headphones (like you would with any other pair). Within 4 months, I lost sound in the right ear. Now, at the end of June, I'm beginning to lose sound in the other.I understand you get what you pay for. I wasn't expecting much. Durability would have been nice, though. Because they didn't last, I classify it as a total waste of money."
4,Good headphones for the price,I have no issues with these headphones. They work and fit just fine for me. I wear them mostly at home (they look a bit goofy to wear outdoors) and they provide great sound for the money. They have an extra long cord with a pocket clip that takes up any unwanted slack (a big plus for me). If you need a nice pair of headphones under $30 bucks you won't be sorry with these.
2,not durable,This product looks nice but will die after a couple of months even if you do nothing to it. It is cheap so I guess one has to kind of expect that. I'd just save my money until I could get a decent pair of headphones. These are not worth it.
4,Good for the Price,"There are a very decent pair of cheap over-the-ear headphones. They sound pretty good with most kinds of music; I haven't found a situation where I wasn't pleased with the way they sound. The only reason I wouldn't recommend these is that they aren't the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. They exert a certain amount of pressure on the ears that can be irritating if I wear them for long periods of time, however I got used to them after a couple of weeks. If you're looking for a really comfortable pair of headphones these might not be the best choice. However, for the price it's hard to complain."
3,Hate the cord,"I didn't realize when buying these headphones why they were billed as ideal for DJ use (I'm not a DJ). The reason is that they have the world's longest cable--about 10 feet, I think. I ended up gathering up the excess cable and putting a rubber band around it--very clumsy. Also bad, the 2 cables from the headphones going down to the Y get all tangled up no matter what I do. I get so frustrated with these headphones that I deliberately treat them rough, hoping they'll break and I'll have an excuse for getting a better pair.Their performance with music is fine; no complaints."
4,Great product for a great price!,These are a really nice headphone for the price. I love the 10ft long cord; it allows me to move around my office with out having to remove them. The only thing I have a problem with is that my ears start to hurt when wearing them for an extended period. My ears are not huge either. Other than that they are awesome.
4,Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones,"Pretty good for what you pay for. Not exactly a headphones master but if you just want decent headphones for your money, these are the ones."
2,okay but they hurt the ears,"Okay, some background:circum-aural - goes totally around your eatssupra-aural - sits on top of your ear but doesn't surround itThe problem with these headphones is that they are made out of the material you would expect a circum-aural headphone to be made out of, so it is stiff (not soft), but it is supra-aural, so that stiff material sits on your ear and presses it into your skull. To see what this might feel like, take your finger and make a hook and then lay it flat against your ear and press it against your head.The headphones are unbearable for more than 40 minutes at a time so while they may be good for traveling or on the bus listening to a music player, they are not good for regular computer use. Get a circumaural headphone or a supra-aural set that isn't as stiff as a rock"
4,Great Headphones...a bit tight though!,Sennheiser lives upto its name with this product. HD 212 is a great product if you have a wide range of music taste. It reproduces Bass quite well. Doesn't crack while reproducing high tones (of course it depends on the MP3 quality as well). Only discomfort is that it is a bit tight on the ears. HD212Pro is a better buy over this if you are willing to bridge the $30 but HD212 still rocks!
4,Good headphones,"I'm not a pro on selecting head phones but so I left the sound rating at 4/5 but for my use I would give them 5/5. I got these to wear while I play my Alesis DM6 electric drums and they work great! They block out enough sound so I can't hear the stick/pad hits over some of the quieter sounds (hi-hat, etc.) and the bass is clean and crisp. They are very comfortable (I've only worn them for 45 minutes max) and they are durable. My kids can even wear them since they are very adjustable. The long cord is great to be able to put the cord behind me and out of the way for drumming."
4,"Good sound, not really comfortable","Sound quality is amazing! But not really comfortable. If you don't use more than 45 min at a time, I can say that don't even think!"
3,High expectations,"The headphones didn't live up to my expectations. I bought them instead of going with another brand thinking about the money, but lately I've been using them and I'm not completely satisfied. After a while wearing the headphones I feel a very strong tension on my ears and the side of my head. The sound quality is good, but I was going for comfort as well."
3,"Great sound, poor comfort","For less than $25 and with so many positive reviews, I decided to pick these up to use while working at home.My initial impression was that these sounded great. I was hearing parts of songs I'd never noticed before. Bass was good and every song/movie sounded fantastic.However, after about 20 minutes of use my ears started to hurt. I have a pretty averaged sized head and averaged sized ears but these headphones really made my ears sore. My girlfriend found the same to be true as well although it took her longer to feel an discomfort. So I gave these a three, what's the point of great sound if I can't stand to have these on my head. Somewhat subjective I know but just something to keep in mind."
2,Nice Price/Decent Sound. Terrible Cord Durability.,One year of light use and the cord is already starting to fray at the connection point with the right earpiece. Difficult if not impossible to repair.
1,Right side has already failed,"I haven't even used these for a combined total of two hours and the right side is already dead. I get either complete silence or pure static. I didnt lay my head down while using them or anything. Even if these HAD worked as expected, they arent very confortable to wear, they mash up against the sides of my ears instead of truly fitting over them.Only buy these if you don't mind driving down to the post office to return them, AND your significant other is attracted to cauliflower ears.UPDATE:If one of your sides have failed, try BLASTING the volume for a moment. I normally keep my TV volue at about 50, but jamming it all the way to 99 forces the bad side of these headphones to start working. After it works, then turn volume down to your normal listening level. It still goes bad from time to time, but using this method has brought it back to working condition every time so far."
1,2nd pair,"Got a second pair because my son's were so good, his sister kept borrowing them. So I got her the same pair. Best sound for the buck. However, both pairs have failed due to poor wiring. Nearly impossible to re-solder connections. They will be replaced by SONY phones."
3,Good enough,"You get what you pay for. I usually take good care of my electronic equipment,with that being said, I fear these headphones are not durable enough to withstand prolonged use. They sound nice and my IPOD powers them enough for a pleasent sound. However, they do smash your head and push on your ears. Good enough for $40.00"
3,Entry Level,"For the price, these phones are ok. But let me tell you, if you think they're gonna be accurate at reproducing sound, you'll be disappointed. They are exceptionally bass heavy, and that bass is muddy as can be. Highs are rolled off, and mids are lost in the sonic distortion caused by the overwhelming bass frequencies.I haven't tried other phones in this price range (these came with another product I bought), but I wouldn't buy them if I needed to. I'd look elsewhere."
2,"Ok, but not great","Got these over a year ago. First the cord is WAY too long, its made for people watching TV from 10 feet way. TOTAL PAIN when walking with the MP3 player. The sound is alright, but the bass is lacking. The cheap plastic connectors wear out so you speaker position won't stay in place if you use very much. They hurt after a hour of wearing. Can't hear outside noises, so thats good."
2,makes my ears sore,"Okay for the money but I have a lighter Sennheiser at work that I wear all day without problems because it has a very gentle and light ear piece that rests on only the middle of the ear. When I come home and put on this heavy, uncomfortable set, I am always disappointed. The sound is good enough to live up to Sennheiser expectations, but the ear pad sits on the soft cartilage of your ears, rather than your scull bone, so it is uncomfortable and too warm."
1,do not buy. very tight on your ears,I bought this head phones by looking at 300 plus positive reviews and ignoring negative reviews. But I am very disappointed with my decision. These are very tight on my ears. I cant wear them even for 30 minutes with out paining my ears.
3,Watch out for size of mini-jack,I bought these headphones to plug into my Toshiba Satellite laptop. I found out the laptop takes a 16 ohm mini-plug and the plug on the headphones is 32 ohm and has a smaller diameter. The headphones work on an Ipod and other computers but not on the Toshiba laptop.
1,BIG disappointment,"I bought these on the basis of the reviews, the price and the need to cut down on sound in a mildly noisy workspace. I'd say that there is about a 10 percent reduction in noise, even with music playing; much less than I expected. I don't recommend these and should have done more research. And they aren't very comfortable either."
3,little difference from regular ipod headphones,"I am no expert on sound quality, but I didn't find a great difference from my regular headphones (which came with the ipod) to these. There is a tiny improvement with the bass and the noise proof, but not enough to keep the vacuum noise and the gardening noise out. I did find them comfortable to wear for long periods and in the winter should definitely keep my ears warm. I think next time I would pay a little more, just so I can do the vacuuming without having to turn it off."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I've owned these headphones for about a year. These headphones sound good for the price. The cord is plenty long enough, almost too long even with the wind-up belt clip, and has a 3.5mm end and comes with a 1/4 inch adapter. My complaints are the headphones are a tight fit, they seem to press against the side of my head, but it has gotten better with use. Also the ear pads don't breathe well and your ears will start to sweat after long use (about 60 min in my experience), I wish the pads where made of cloth instead of the plastic foam stuff. I mostly use them for podcasts and audio books, so can't speak for the frequency response, but sound just perfect for my use."
3,Clarity is lacking but okay for the price,"I bought these thinking that they would fully cover my ears and substitute as an alternative to electronic noise-reducing headphones. Turns out they are the exact same size as my Sennheiser 497s, which I got five years ago for about 50 bucks. The soundstage on the 497s is great - real clarity and good sound separation. The 202s seem much more muddy, though they are a bit louder. But there is no soundstage or sweet spot at all. To be fair, I have not thoroughly broken them in yet. IF the sound improves after the first 100 hours of listening, I'll update this review. Both the 497s and the 202s are hard on my ears physically due to the tight fit. I do not consider my ears to be overly large nor is my head oversized, at least as far as hat sizes goes. Guess I need to find some real big cans that really go around the ear."
2,Big Heads need not apply,"Well, I was optimistic when I ordered these. They were comfortable after the simple adjustment to fit my head. They fit tight around my ears and the sound was really great. Nice bass, and the mids didn't drift to the high end like some others.However, after wearing these for a half hour, I found that the tension squeezing these on my head gave me a headache. They're too tight."
5,Great sound. Good price.,These headphones are very good. The sound is phenominal and they effectively block out most backround noise. The bass and treble are very well balanced. The chord is a bit long but that's not an issue as it can be wound up. The headphones also came with a jack which allows me to plug them into my guitar amp etc. I would highly recommend buying these headphones.
5,They're perfect,"I purchased these to use in my transcription work. They block out outside sound very well. Sound is fantastic. Cord is nice and long. The fit is snug, but does not hurt at all. Very glad I went ahead and made this purchase. Hopefully they'll last for a good long time."
3,Worth $25,These headphones should meet your expectations for sound quality from a $25 pair of headphones - I am surprised Senheiser put their name on them because they are neither remarkable or an especially great value.High and mid range seem a bit flat but the bass is solid.I returned these because they are simply too tight for my head. If your hat size is 7-1/4 or larger you may want to try something else. They were painful to wear after just 10 minutes.
3,Great Sound but 2 Problems,"The sound is great on these and they block much of the surrounding noise. Having the long cord is nice too. As others have reported, they are too tight and are slightly too small for the ears. I kind of have to tuck my ears in but are not uncomfortable. I don't think my head or ears are larger than average.What stinks for me is that I paid just under $40 in Feb 2012 and now they are less than half that! I'll be looking at the newer version to see if they have a better fit since they are currently $20."
3,Not comfortable if you have a big head,"There are numerous reviews of the sound, which is fine for phones in this price range. I wanted to comment on the comfort. I have a large head. I wear a 7 3/4 hat. These phones are not adjustable in any way -- just a single piece of plastic (although it is well padded). The problem is the pressure on the ears, and the lack of padding on the earpieces. The padding is too squishy, quite simply. Do not buy these if you are a cabbage head like me."
3,Regular,"I had higher expectations on these ones. Not very good at noise cancelling.. Does not have that intense bass i was looking for..I guess they are good for what i payed, i should have gotten the skullcandy with bass thingy..Pros:Good cable length."
3,Quality Fair. Wires Ripped Easily.,"Quality is fair for a cheaper set of headphones.But,Poor strain relief at wire connections. After less than 2 years of moderate careful use, one of the wires has already come loose from one headphone. I'm not even certain that it is repairable."
4,"Good sound, size could be better","The sound is good for the price, and the noise isolation is adequate. The one thing that prevents me from giving it a five (5) star rating is comfort. They sit on your ears (at least partially) instead of over your ears. That makes them less comfortable than ideal."
3,Don't expect much...,"For the price you pay, you get veiled highs and mids, with muddy lows. Articulation is poor, and the soundstage is narrow. Overall, I'd spend money on ear buds before these. Pass...If you want a great value, look at the JVC HA-RX900. Very nice for the money."
3,Disappointing,"Just got these, and don't really care for them. They sound OK, and I guess you get what you pay for. They sound a little boxy and heavy on the low end to me. Certainly usable though....not a bad sound."
2,Great for one year.,Like a lot of other folks the right side stopped working after a year of use. Too bad cause I really liked the product.
1,Not satisfied,"I really did not like these headphones. They made my head hurt, and especially hurt my ears. I sent them back."
4,"Too tight for me, but I would buy it for others if the price came back down.","I bought this in March 2010 for just over twenty dollars. It has a wonderful sound and is really nice quality overall, but it does not fit me. It is too tight for me and I can't wear it for longer than maybe ten minutes at a stretch before it becomes really uncomfortable. So I gave it away to a smaller-headed friend who is very happy with it. I would buy it as a gift again, but only at the lower price. If you have a small head, I recommend this product, even though it now costs about 50% more than what I paid for it less than a year ago. Good reviews seem to drive the prices up, eh? Pity."
5,Frasier Season 1,This was purchased as a gift for someone that had just seen an episode or 2 on TV.She doesn't care for the tv programs on these days and requested this dvd.She loves it! She's watched the whole season already.
1,Terrible comedy series,"This show is so bad, I don't even know why I'm taking the time to write this review, it's not worth it. Why anyone would want to watch a show about snobs is beyond me."
3,Episode cut short,"This episode is only 18 min 11 sec long. It stops after Frazier's Dad says ""Nurse Ratched."" Hopefully Amazon will correct this."
5,Broadman Commentary,I have been using the Broadman Bible Commentary since they were first published in the 1970s. It is a solid conservative commentary written by Southern Baptist Seminary professors. I actually studied under many of the men who wrote various sections of the books. I lost the fifth volume of the set in 2003 during a move. I have been searching for it since and was thrilled to find a replacement volume.I had a 5000 volume library when I retired. This set was only one of three that I kept. It doesn't get any better than Broadman Bible Commentary. I recommend it to all serious students of the the Bible.
1,Waste of time if your looking for definitive topic solutions,This book is a summation of interview questions and answers that are too general and have no topic construction. The book's chapter titles are unrelated to the content within the chapter and the same questions were asked over and over again. There are no objectives for what you are supposed to be learning from this book. And the advice given by most of the designers is pedestrian at best or let's just say extremely obvious. The book shows little organization and is written in a substandard format. If you like name dropping you'll love this book. I'm really surprised Marc Saltzman wrote this. Not worth the money.
4,Nice scissors but tiny,"I don't know why, but I thought 6"" was the blade length. These are 6"" total length from handle to blade tip. Actually, a handy size to keep in a kitchen drawer."
3,Bad belt,Bike works decently enough but the belt broke within a week. Had to wait for more than a month and call customer service several times before the new belt was delivered.
3,Good Intentions and you know the rest,"I bought this bike thinking I was going to get in shape but it turns out I like my current shape its fits really well to the couch. I did use the bike for a few month though. The bike was a pain to put together and it came in to many parts but once it is done it looks pretty good. I didn't like the back rest, it just was to hard and after about and hour your back hurts a bit. I placed a pillow and it seemed to help. The digital display is easy to use and it isn't that loud so you can still watch TV or read while you workout. The one thing I will recommend is the price for someone like me who was not really committed to working out I am glad I didn't spend a lot. Its fairly light to move around and it doesn't take up that much room."
3,Pure fantasy,"After just watching this film, I have to say I am a bit disappointed. To start with a good note, the actors were brilliant, it was well filmed for the time, and it was an enjoyable fictional film. However, my excitement at coming across this film was due to my long study of English history, the period and the monarchy. This film was a complete disappointment as a hisorically accurate piece. The facts were entirely muddled, and the relationship between Jane and Guilford was utter nonsense. There is no evidence whatsoever that he was even kind to her much less in love with her. Jane had very little happiness in her upbringing from what we can find in history, and even less in her later years. Long story short, if you want to enjoy a good drama, it's a great film. If you want to know the history of Jane, please pick up a good history book and completely disregard 75% of this film."
1,Jane must have been replaced by a clone,"One of the worst movies I've seen in my life.I researched a bit and found that the real Lady Jane was very different from this 'clone'.They made her sound like an idiot who backs up the wrong things and doesn't use her head,Also,Jane Grey was suppose to have 'sandy hair',not dark brown."
1,Sportsman's Paradise 2,"I wouldn't recommend this game. I thought it would be really fun until I bought it. The graphics are horable and you can run faster than the animals going slow. The animals are dumb looking and not real at all. I own 10 hunting games and I'd strongly recommend to buy Buckmaster Deer Hunting and Bird hunter Wild Wings Edition. They are the best games I've ever played. Lots of rifle, bows, shotguns,and muzzeloaders equipment. You can drive fourwheeleres, trucks and even boats. Great games features and graphics."
3,An alright science book,I like this book only because it had more than activities in it then expected. I did find a few activities mention in the book to not be age developmental appropriate
5,Excellent Multi-purpose headphones for the price,"First of all, these headphones are very lightweight and comfortable to wear, even for extended periods. They are also very efficient and easily used at home or with a portable, although they really sound their best when used with a headphone amplifier. The sound from these headphones is very clear with excellent bass with well balanced mids and highs. Overall I would say that for the price and portability these headphones are near-perfect. The only thing that I could really think of improving on is the split-Y cord. I personally would have preferred only having one cord, but in this respect I am just nit-picking. :)"
4,"Work pretty well, not great bass","Very clear, nice sound. Considering how much I paid, i'm satisisfied."
4,"Great, but the size too small","The headphones work very good, the only thing is the size. They are too small. Unless you are a small person with small ears, I would not buy them."
4,"Not bad, but not great","The headphones are really pretty good and the vibration feature is kinda neat too. But although I never use the microphone in any of my games, I did test it. It's a real joke. I mean, I think I'll take a set of cutters to it and just cut it off to get it out of my way. It's truly that bad."
1,Its a computer game?,"unfortunatly is it. ALL YOU DO IS STAND AND SHOOT FLYING NERDS. I thought it was good (by the cover)but It wasnt, I have just flushed 10 dollars worth of money down the drain=("
5,Readily accessible to non-specialist general readers,"Islam: A Mosaic, Not A Monolith by Vartan Gregorian (President of the Carnegie Corporation of New York), is an informed and informative survey of the Islamic faith since its inception some 1,400 years ago. Examining Islam's tenets, institutions, changes, role in history, crucial questions that have caused strife among Muslim states, and a great deal more, Islam: A Mosaic, Not A Monolith is readily accessible to non-specialist general readers, yet thoughtful enough in its study and presentation of complicated issues of faith, politics, and culture to be of considerable value for scholars and dedicated students of Islamic Studies as well. In view of contemporary American efforts to combat the threat of international terrorism arising from fundamentalist Islamic extremists, Islam: A Mosaic, Not A Monolith should be present in the collections of every school and community library system in the country."
4,great live cd,This is a cd if you want to hear him live. in the medley his voice wears out and he forces it leaving a bad performance to enjoy listening. But there are some AWESOME arrangements on some songs. the sound is clear and good. minus one star for his weared out voice on an important medley.
5,a mixture of techno with enough room for real musicians,ok if you like your techno with some real people behind it this is one to get . fronted buy greg ginn(guitar crazy man) and andy batwinas (man of many drum tones)from the screw radio projects (those sre good to)this new project is a kind of techno jam .with a back drop of sinister keyboard buy ron beck this album has just the right amount of both aspects to keep either the techno snobs or punk snobs in line for a while .also of course like most of greg ginns last couple of bands this is all instumental .i guess what i would call it because people always want a lable on music it is post/ anti /punk /techno.one of those kinds of albums that when ya put it on at a gathering the party will start to get more hopping afterwards . weird huh..
3,It's okay,My husband bought this game for himself. He was entertained.....for a day and a half! He said that parts of it were slow to load and the game ended WAY too quickly.
4,Better than reviews stated,I believe this game is good. It is a lot of fun; and has plenty of interesting characters to keep you excited. The controls are simple and the fighting is planned; but the overall experience is fun.I think they made this game for girls but I found my bf interested too.Worth trying.
5,Best of the trilogy.,"I reckon this is the best of the trilogy. Decent plot, good acting (Rosamund Kwan a very cute actress too). And you can hardly find a fighting scene as well choreographed as the one between Jet Li and Donnie Yen, both being ""real"" masters from Shaolin. When it comes to Kung-fu in the post-Bruce-Lee era, only the well-trained techniques of Li and Yen can really take your breath away (unless you prefer Jackie Chan's acrobatic moves and funny stuff, that is). Jet Li goes on scoring big with ""Kiss of the Dragon"", but I don't think he is cut out for the double role in ""The One"". So far my top five martial arts films are: ""Fist of Fury"" (Bruce Lee), ""Iron Monkey"" (Donnie Yen), ""Wing Chun"" (Michelle Yeoh), ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and ""New Legend of Shaolin"" (Jet Li)."
1,DUMB!!,"This is supposed to be a kung fu movie right? IF so, why are there only 3 fight scenes in the whole 2 hours that it runs? And the fight scenes aren't good at all. This is the dumbest Jet Li movie I have seen yet. ""Meltdown"" follows close behind. If you are a Jet Li fan like me, and you want to see him at what he does best, rent ""Fist of Legend"" (MY FAV.), ""Twin Warriors,"" and ""The Enforcer."" Leave this one on the shelves."
3,"Big on plot, little on action","Long story short: if you want to see a movie heavy on plot, (complicated as it is) OUATIC 2 is for you. However, if you want to see a movie which showcases both Jet Li and Donnie Yen's incredible martial arts skills, you'll have to look somewhere else as those skills are used very sparingly, in fact they're buried so deeply in the movie amid all the plot you almost have to ask yourself why they were included in the first place.'Fist of Legend' and 'The Tai Chi Master', among many others, are Jet Li's best which exibit his tremendous physical talents. 'Drunken Tai Chi' and 'Iron Monkey' are a must see for both fans and those who are unfamiliar with Donnie Yen, an established actor and martial artist who'll soon make his mark just like Jackie Chan and Jet Li."
5,Felicity -True to Univ. Life,"This DVD is a refreshing glimpse into the wonderful years of college. The first time I watched the show, I was hooked, and to be able to watch this DVD at my own pace is great. Lacking are extras beside 2 commentaries. It is a bit of a pain that ""chapters"" are not really inserted, if you ask it to change chapters you get the next or previous episode instead...Though that is lacking, the feel is not--the acting is superb, and thru watching this I realize that the first time it was great not only because I related, I also believed the story line."
5,Hardest Taebo Ive done...,I started Taebo way back when it first came out. Unfortunately quit working out for a few years. Started back few months ago. The moves were easy to pick back up. I have 5 other taebo dvds but this one kicked my butt. I had to stop and put on pause to catch my breath a lot. Its my go to dvd when I want that extra push and want to test myself. After a few tries it does get easier. Its a good workout. But its also a no joke workout.
2,Good video - but harder than expected,I LOVED the Taebo set of tapes that i bought in the late 90's. The are impossible to find though so i got this. Its a hour long and its hard. Its also very repetitive.whatever happened to the easy Taebo tapes? Is working out only for fit people???
1,Billy missed the point!,Taebo is hard to do if you do not have VERY STRONG ankles! Almost every move requires you to pivot with your ankles in ways most people have never dune. I almost sprained my ankle trying the most basic moves. I got this to work my gut not my ankles! Apparently Billy Blanks expects everyone that tries this to already be in good shape. That wins the award for missing the point of a home workout. In the end I had the trow this dvd away because I could not do the workouts.
5,AWESOME...favorite Billy Blanks workout,"Now I have about 8 taebo workouts that were good, but not the greatest. I bought this one in hopes that I would keep interested and start to really sweat. I did just that. I love it. It's fast paced and has awesome moves that will really give you a good work out. I've been doing it now for about 5-6 weeks and 5 days a week. I am now looking for something else to change it up a little, but I will always keep this one in my library! I've been recommending this to all my friends and family that are looking for a good workout."
5,Maybe Not What Americans Want to Hear,"As an American, I'm reluctant to accept the fact that there is more to power than the projection of military might. However, the Chinese and the Europeans are in the early stages of teaching us a hard lesson. This book addresses the myth that ""Old Europe,"" is irrelevant. The economic and social power that is emerging in the European Union will have to be dealt with by our children, who will still be paying the bill for our misguided imperialism. This book highlights the history of the unification efforts and discusses the factors that are emerging which are drawing the European people together. I found the book to be highly readable and compelling, although I didn't necessarily agree with all of the author's assertions."
4,Works very well,"Nice keyboard and mouse but it's not the best. Expect could be better. They keyboard has a lot of great functionality but not ergonomically(work better if you have gel pad), the size takes a lot of space.The mouse is ok just ok nothin really special, just like the optical mouse. Lazer sounds cool but it function the same, I like optical more because of the red glares created by the infra. The lazer has no light refelction visible at all.OVERALL, I like it but I wont give 2 thumbs. Consider the price, it's a good value"
2,Flat and lifeless,This keyboard is very flat. Even with the rear pegs out the angle is almost zero. As with most all cordless keyboards the lights that indicate such things as caps lock and numbers lock are not available on the keyboard to save battery power and so are much harder to see. I found the big volume control wheel in the middle to be very laggy. The mouse is ergonomic to hold but difficult to move compared to a stardard cordless mouse. The extra controls on the mouse are not recognized by games.
2,very short range,"Here's something to consider -- the range can be VERY short (around one foot), after that the response can get erratic. Putting the receiver in the corner of my desk will NOT work. There's another wireless keyboard+mouse setup on the desk next to me. So the interference may be causing the problem."
2,Review: Logitech Cordless Desktop MX 3000 Laser,"I bought it a few weeks ago, problems from the start I use my LCD TV as my computer screen, lag on mouse and keyboard increase greatly when I moved over 2 and a half feet (yes, I measured it) Also, the zoom key would get stuck.. brand new system, never spilled anything on it) and cause my screen to zoom in and out rapidly, only way I could stop it was to reboot and loose my work. Also, it looks GREAT, but I don't need half of the buttons. I ended up taking it back and replacing it with Microsoft (I hate Microsoft) bluetooth system which was more expensize, but with a range of up to 30 feet, response is awesome and I've all but forgotten what mouse lag was?!?!"
2,It's no Princess Bride,"After reading The Princess Bride, few books will meet its standards...So, with HUGE expectations, I read The Silent Gondoliers. It was a big dissapointment! It would be an ok childrens book...but it lacked the wit and great storyline that I've come to expect from William Goldman."
5,My old elementry school chums :),"WOWthats all I have to say. A bunch of guys growing up in the middle of nowhere (w00t for rural Ontario!)...I've seen most of the members perform all through highschool in various garage bands, as like myself. I didn't think that it could go this far.BUY THIS DISC! you won't be disappoited. The music has a groove for everyone."
3,Avanti,I'm a big fan of Jack Lemmon so when I saw this movie I thought I'd purchase it. It was a cute movie but not all that great.
4,enjoyable read,Seven Sisters is quite an enjoyable read. This book introduces some new characters to the Benni Harper series and makes for an mildly suspenseful read.
1,This product has a CA Prop 65 Warning,"I give this item zero stars. I bought a can of it for my son and a few days later he asked why I gave him food with a Prop 65 warning label on it. Who knew? Hidden, in extremely small print on the back of the can is a CA Prop 65 warning: ""This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.""It is the same warning we see now for some types of vinegars. The only difference is those labels are clearly visible in conspicuous places on the products. I don't care if this carries only the smallest trace amount of lead or whatever the offending chemical is. I won't buy this product again for my family. The fact that they didn't put the warning on the product in a clearly visible place you would see before purchasing it is disgusting. I purchased this product at a Henry's grocery.My son also said this stuff tastes terrible compared to the other whey protein isolate products I have purchased.Kathy"
1,Formula change = gross,"I agree with the previous reviewer: This powder used to taste great, but now it tastes terrible. I thought that I received a bad batch, so I went on here to get more, and now I see that there was a formula change. It has a bad taste that I can't quite describe. If they went back to the old formula, I'd definitely buy this again.But as it is, skip this."
5,Excellent CD,My first from this artist. But it has now been playing constantly in my truck wherever I go for the past 3 weeks or so. There is not a dud on this CD. I am looking forward to getting the next one.
2,Plan Colombia: Cashing in on the Drug War Failure,"It`s a partial outdated version of the reality. It tried to look real, honest and actual by having several interviews, but those interviews only shows one part of the reality. The people selected to be presented were carefully selected to show only one part of the history. They did not interviewed anyone from the government, nor people that received benefits from the program, or simply, common people in Colombia that has a better perception of the country, that feels safer because of the Plan. They are a lot more than those presented in this video. Plan Colombia has several faces, not all of them are good, but one reality is that my country is a lot better now, than it was before it. Other interested parts of Plan Colombia aren`t well explained such us where the money relly goes...."
1,No instructions!!,"I enjoy the elliptical.. i really do, especially when I first received the box. It had NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL!!! how da heck do you expect someone to put this together!!"
3,"Good, but probably could be improved","I liked the fact that they were on sale for $40, a bonus when you're not looking to spend + $100 for headphones. They have a great depth of sound, they do reproduce clear, crisp bass and high pitch notes as well.However, they are almost too light weight, as in kinda flimsy, not bad but on the verge of being afraid they'll break any time they're dropped onto firm carpet from a height of two feet. being as light as they are, you'd fgure you really wouldn't feel them on your head at all, however I was surprised to find that they actually produced a very noticeable pressure on your head when wearing. Not enough to prevent me from using them but enough to make prolonged use uncomfortable.Finally, like I had heard before I purchased: the ear pieces are small, i don't have big ears at all and the cups barely fit, this is the worst part of all.Nice to know they sell replacement cords, the cord unplugs too."
5,Great headphones for the money,"I would agree with the other comments that these headphones offer great bass. If you want to get picky, they lack a little bit of clarity on the treble side, but again for the price, I don't think you can beat them. They're also really comfortable on. I wear them plugged into my Ipod or computer at work."
5,get these,"these headphones have somepowerful bass that doesnt distort, theyre perfect for watching any kind of movie, and they're the best headphones i can find for hard hiphop beats, they really rock your dome, trust me.. i want another pair"
2,cord broke quickly,"The plug has a short in it causing only one speaker to function. They didn't last long, a year maybe with light use. I bought some earbud sennheisers about the same time and the same things happened. I can't honestly think the way I used them was abusive or otherwise my fault. I used the two headphones on separate devices exclusively. I think Sennheiser just has bad plugs."
3,Alright,"They are alright, almost the same as The HD-202's except these seem much more flat to me (i mean the EQ in the drivers could use alot of work). These arent naturally silver. its just painted plastic. the silver chipped off after about 4 months. Also the left earphone cord pulled out. Mind you, it wasnt even an accident, it just kind fell out... They are good but if you want good headphones, go for the HD-202's for a cheaper price"
4,Good portable headphones,"Good build quality and good sound quality, but heavy on the bass. Great passive noise-canceling properties, perfect for sleeping on a plane, even without playing music through them :)"
3,Good but not great,I expected much more out of these. They are still good I could hear beats & voices in songs which werent there with my old headphones. Sounds really good. The best function is the bass. It's really booming. It's a good bang for your buck.
4,"Awesome headphones, for a little while..","I bought these headphones back in the end of Jan. 2005, and they were incredible from the day I got them, except the durability. The music sounded very good, movies and games sounded exceptional. The only problem I have with these headphones is that for some reason, 2 months after I got them, the right speaker started to sound liike it was blown. I thought it was my reciever, I tried another, same problem. A month later, the left speaker started screeching, mind you both speakers have a problem at different bass tones, treble sounds fine. Ive yet to call up the maker about the warranty, im sad though cause these headphones rock, if only the durability of them was alittle better. :(5 Stars for Sound Quality.3 Stars for the Durability."
4,"Great sound, a little ugly but they do the job","I work in a fairly noisy space and listen to music for about half the day in order to concentrate. After ruining another pair of headphones by running over the cord one too many times, I polled some of my coworkers and these Sennheisers got the best endorsement. I was never really crazy about the design, but what I really liked about them is that the cord pops right out of them and can be replaced if necessary. Then I gave them a test drive and the sound was pretty incredible. A little heavy on the bass, but I don't have a problem with that. So I figured that for the price, I could live with them looking a little dorky. It's not like I have to look at them while I'm wearing them."
2,The 30-day Total Health Makeover,"Though this book has some interesting information I find it discouraging to use for several reasons. First, the author failed to include an index of the recipes to refer back to. Second, many of the ingredients are unusual for the average person. She gives no real assistance in describing what something is to help one find it -- and I'm a fairly seasoned shopper and cook! Finally,I do not think the author is truelly concerned about her average reader. She is so idealistic she forgets many (most!) of us have limited resources in time and money. She can, if reader isn't careful, make you feel like you are a lesser-able person -- when you are really trying to stick to a diet and change a lifestyle it is quite discouraging.For general information regarding her theory I'd recommend instead her other book ""Total Health Makeover"". Perhaps there are better cookbooks to use for actual meal planning -- I'm still looking!"
3,"Excellent information, advice, and daily living tips","This book is packed with good nutritional advice. It is written in an easy to understand language and tone. Some of the suggestions she makes seem a little tough for meat and dairy eaters, however, I have learned that even taking her advice in moderation has made a huge difference on the scale and in my general health and appearance."
3,Drastic change in eating habits,"Living in a small town, I found most of the food mentioned in the book impossible to find. I had to return the book. It is well written and my hat is off to anyone and Ms. Henner who can make such a drastic change and stay with it."
2,freak patrol beware !!!!!!!!!!,"this book has got to be outlawed! women are starving themselves enough already ! yes.. it is not a diet but a way of life. yeah right !! my wife no longer eats anything that we would consider normal ! it is getting scary.. rice ice cream.. rice milk...got soy""???????BY THE WAY.. WHAT IS PANKO????"
2,Not quite the book I expected...,"I've enjoyed Marilu Henner on TAXI and in here other roles, so I thought this diet would be right up my alley. But you know what. It wasn't. Dissapointed."
1,e-805 Toshiba PDA,"The toggle switch on my new e805 broke the second time I moved it from WiFi to off. I sent the unit in under warrenty. Toshiba warrenty department said the mother board must be replaced to fix the toggle switch and is not covered under warrenty. They charged $125.00 to repair unit. I've bought a lot of Toshiba products, this will be the last.Guy A. EdwardsSturgisSouth Dakota"
3,So-So Book,I've tried three (3) dishes from this book. Part of me feel it lacks a good kick (taste) to the dishes. Is the writer from North or South Vietnam? It does give you where to start in cooking vietnamese food.
1,wrong,"ordered ""Red Dragon"" DVD and received ""Bourne Identity"". Still need Red Dragon so will give it another try. I don't want a substitute!"
3,"""Wish I hadn't read the book first""","Though the book was scary, and kept me reading, the movie lacked an edge. Ralph Fiennes is a great actor, the job he does in Shindlers List is phenomenol. His role in this movie is dismal. The book portrays a large, unattractive man with a bad speech impediment, caused by a cleft palette. This downfall in the movie single-handedly ruined it for me. Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter brilliantly as usual. If you like this movie, you would probably enjoy Manhunter. This is the original version of the same story, and actually follows the same story until the finale. The villain in Manhunter is much more believable than Fiennes, in my opinion. At any rate, Red Dragon is not as good as Hannibal, and definitely not as good as the cult classic, Silence of the Lambs."
3,"Marvelllous cast, average movie...","The producers went to great efforts to make a slick porduction, with attention to the detail. I enjoyed the movie a lot, mainly due to the marvellous cast: Norton, Hopkins, Keitel, Fiennes! uau!"
2,"Same scenario than ""Silence of the lambs""","Nothing new here, this is simply a pale copy of the first movie ""The silence of the lambs"", there is absolutely nothing new here. The kind of movie we have seen over and over again. Stick with the first movie."
3,OK REMAKE WITH NOVEL'S ENDING THIS TIME,"If a sense of deja vu hangs over RED DRAGON - Director's Edition, it's because producer Dino De Laurentis already made Manhunter, a 1989 version of Thomas Harris's brilliant best seller.This time around, Brett Ratner directs, and Anthony Hopkins is back as insane Dr. Lekter (without Sir Anthony, there's no real justification for this film). Baby faced Ed Norton is disappointing as the reluctant collaborator of Lekter in tracking the somewhat sympathetic ""Tooth Fairy"" killer wonderfully underplayed by Ralph Feinnes. Ted Tally's lean screenplay includes the book's jolting finale, something the first film version strangely omitted.The loaded two disc edition has a featurette on FBI profiling and Ratner's interesting video diary (including a weird visit to the set by Michael Jackson). The unusually incisive commentary by Talley and Ratner is as interesting as the movie."
2,Unpalatable,Was this siamese-prequel even necessary? Aren't there enough out there already? If you're interested in the pre-Lecter years then see 'Manhunter' - a far superior film. 2 stars ONLY because of Hopkin's performance. Edward Norton's portrayal of agent Will Graham is so weak and girlish you wish Lecter would have succeeded in killing him at the beginning. I guess Hannibal doesn't like quiche.
1,BRETT DRAGGIN ....,"Let's not mince words about this clunker - see the original Michael Mann for real thrills - this one wastes talent, time and your {money}"
4,Good but not great,Enjoyed the movie but not as good as the earlier sequels. Seller was very good. Item shipped within 2 days of ordering and arrived days before the estimated delivery date.
2,messy,didn't smell all that great and it was really gunky in the bath after awhile. It should be sold with a net or something for holding all that stuff in. I was covered with vegetation after my bath like seaweed. Yuck!
2,Break easily,I bought this set at a major name brand store and thought it was a great deal. The glasses are nice to look at but break so easily. I am not tough on glasses and I find a new crack just about every week. Not sure if it is happening in the dishwasher or what. The cracks eventually get so bad the whole glass shatters. I now have one large tumbler left. I have 5 of the smaller glasses left. So I now have 6 out of the 16 glasses left. I have not even had them for a year and expected them to last given that they are Anchor Hocking...a reliable brand that is known for their heavy duty measuring cups. I would not purchase them again.
1,Tall ones break,"These glasses look very nice (my wife complimented me on my taste) but the tall ones break way too easily. This morning, I was washing one of them and it broke in my hand, causing a small cut on the back of my hand. We are now down to 4 taller ones along with the smaller tumblers."
4,really like the tutorial aspects!!!,"All though there are errors, check the errata www.tomontheweb3.com!! Never touched flash before, and I now have a n understanding of the basic concepts plus good example to build off. If you want to learn by doing this is the book for you, just read the errata, and work through the examples. When I couldnt get something to work, it was always MY mistake, not the books."
5,BUY IT,"Your looking at the comments to see if this is a good book.... well it's more than just a good book. You WILL be able to use lightwave after reading this book and following the tutorials. If you have even the slightest interest in Lightwave and would like to learn it but don't know where to start, this book will get you there. Not only is this book a great start, it is an invaluable reference. If you need to figure out how to do something in lightwave, whatever that may be, you can probably find it in this book. BUY IT."
1,I Wouldn't Call It Blushing Nude,"On me this lipstick was a peachy, rust brown color with a matte finish that was really unattractive.My skin is very light with a touch of pink so I thought ""Blushing"" meant a touch of pink in the colorbut that was not the outcome. Think it would probably be much better on someone with a darker, warmer skin tone.Glad it was a gift with purchase from Clinique. The lipstick goes on easily & is moisturizing so I will try the pinkerversions of this product."
3,A hefty work for those with time to explore Pragmatism and modern philosophy.,"There is no way I can do justice in reviewing such a dense volume of work, however, it would be of interest and benefit to philosophy students and those interested in modern philosophical movements in particular. Rorty focuses on American philosophy, and especially ""Pragmatism"" in light of Hegel, Kant, Heidegger, and others. It is a little disconcerting that right from the start he states that he no longer agrees with some of the material, and one wonders whether it is worth investing hours of study and effort in understanding the material. Though by going through the essays readers would be assured of having a greater understanding of at least ""Pragmatism"", modern philosophy, and some of the main arguments for and against ideas from some of the big philosophers of the past."
5,TAKES ME BACK,"I was 13 years old living in Spain when I heard this album. Later that year I moved to Baltimore. 9 years later I still remember the words. When I heard Naturaleza Muerta I cried. Cualquier album de Mecano es bueno, pero este en particular es muy especial para mi. If you too grew up with it, and have only recently found it, you'll know what I mean."
1,Product not received,"It's November and I have not receive my package ups come to my house once stating they will return the next day, I missed a whole days of work waiting for my package it never came. I want my money back."
5,Great product!,"Floravital Iron + Herbs has a great taste. Does not damage your teeth. Does not make you constipated. It is easily digested, causing no stomach problems and best of all, you see positive results quickly. It will increase hemoglobin and hemotocrit levels in a few weeks. I think this is a great product."
1,Very Disappointing!,"The question database is pathetic. Questions started to repeat after the second round! Graphics and sound are good but the lack of questions make this product completely useless. The 30 second timer also takes away from the game. I emailed Disney Interactive asking if supplemental questions could be purchased, but they did not reply. Don't waste the $20, this game becomes boring very quickly."
1,Should be shareware,"A previous reviewer stated that she was a teacher for the mentally-impaired, and was insulted by the speech context. Give me a break ! That's part of the game. I find that the game is was right on track in the beginning. However, after playing the game for about five times, it started giving repetitive questions. For the amount of questions that this program has, they should make it shareware and let you decide if you want to pay the [money] for registration. Then, you can have more questions downloaded. Otherwise this game is a great disappointment and not worth the [money]."
2,Too Many Repeat Questions,"We are very, very disappointed with all of the repeat questions! If it weren't for that it would be great!"
4,Fun but repaditive.,"All and all its a great game. It is just like the show but they need more questions. Once you have played for a few days, its real easy to become a millionaire.( I wish it was that easy)"
2,Absolutely the most pathetic software program ever written,"Holy fat mama! This game was the most hideous thing I have ever played. Not only is it easier than the TV show, its twice as dumb! The first and second questions I was asked the first time I played were the same stinkin' question. From the third game on, I never went without a repeat question. You should stay away from this. It will probably eventually drive you insane by the low-fi sound clip of Regis saying ""Final Answer?"" anyways. Try some of the not-as-pathetic games by eXpert software. Such as extreme paintball, deer hunter, and other quickly thrown together titles. It gets a second star for being functional (barely)"
2,Repetitive and not accurate,"There are two problems with this game:1) Not enough questions, and not enough repetition logic.2) The ""phone a friend"" lifeline is completely useless. If you were on the show, you would phone a real friend and you would have a good idea whether or not they *should* know the answer. On this, you're just calling Regis' friends, so it's not really useful at all. Therefore it's not an accurate representation of the real game. (yes that's bad, and no I don't have a suggestion around the problem)The game is fun for the first 5 games or so, until you start getting more questions repeated. It's not a full priced game though, so you kind of get what you paid for."
1,If only the TV show were this easy...,"My thoughts are a recurring theme of other reviews. The questions repeat too quickly and frequently. Apparently, Disney wanted to take advantage of the show's popularity and rushed to get the CD on shelves for Christmas. Oh well, caveat emptor (this is the answer to one of the repetitive questions). I will be certain to wait until I have read reviews before buying the software. Not worth the novelty of being the first in the family with the game."
1,I'm Glad it Was Only $20!,"My brother and sister were really excited when I ordered the game for a gift. After we opened it on Christmas morning, we could only stand it for about twenty minutes. The questions were ten times harder than on TV, and we could barely get the fastest finger question to work. I was reassured when I saw the game was made by the creators of ""You Don't Know Jack"", but the people at Disney must have rushed this product to market. Take your twenty dollars and put it towards another Jellyvision game like ""Jack..."" or ""Headrush"". This is the most awful computer software I've ever owned!"
1,Worst Game I have ever played,"The game has some serious installation problems. You first get an error ""App.zip"" cannot be installed. Then you get to figure out how to copy the files from the CD manually to a directory six files deep on the hard drive. Then the game failed to launch. I then disabled every program in memory and it finally launched. After playing this repetitive - terrible game for a while - we shut the computer off and then the game refused to launch again. We reinstalled the game several times and then it worked again.This game has bugs galore and was obviously rushed to market. Their Web site has very little information on resolving the problems and after six days of e-mailing them I still don't have any replies. I want my money back!"
2,Disappointed,"I, like many people, am a huge fan of the show. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this... but what I got was disappointment. Like many other people the questions started repeating quickly. Also, unlike the game, you may have to use lifelines on the first few questions: in some cases, they're more difficult than the ones later on! The lack of Regis also makes an impact, and when he does come on, he's either delivering his lengthy between question speeches, or insulting you. This game is good for a little while... but after that, it's repetitive. If you can find some way to rent it for a few days, do that. Otherwise, wait awhile longer."
2,To many repeat questions,The game was fun the first few times but as we continued to try for the million the questions were repeats. It made it very easy to win.
2,Doesn't Work,"The HP 78 Ink Cartridge doesn't work. When put in the printer, I just get the align cartridge message. Tried another cartridge and it worked OK. Reinstalled the EnviroInks Brand Cartridge I received from you. Same problem. Continues align cartridge message. But thanks to Amazon's great customer service, returning it was no problem."
2,Not what I bought.,"I purchased this at the beginning of summer, and left town before it arrived so I only got it a few days ago, stupid move on my part, because now it's too late to return it. Anyways, the picture is not what I received, I got the International version, which has food from all over the world obviously, but some of the recipes I bought the book for are not in it because it is a VERY abbreviated version of the regular american version. Other than the fact it was misrepresented, it's in alright condition and is still fairly useful."
3,John Williams is GOD,"I'm not going to talk about the music by Kaska on this disc, as I only bought it for the Williams pieces. But suffice to say, the Kaska is ok. But nothing special. JW's trumpet concerto is disappointing. Its basically the same old Williams brass stuff we've heard before. But being a huge fan of the composer, I do enjoy the piece. But its not even in the same league as his violin and cello concertos, or even his more lighthearted work ""American Journey"". ""Essay for Strings"" on the other hand, is a different kettle of fish entirely. Only 10 minutes long, but every minute is brilliant. I found it to be a profoundly moving piece, and just as amazing as his Elegy for Cello and his ""Treesong"" piece. Wonderful atmospheric music. Impossible to ignore. He again shows his unparralled talent for orchestration. This CD is worth buying just for those 10 minutes of brilliance. Williams truly is a master of music."
2,incomplete,"AFTER I PURCHASED THIS COMFORTER, I FOUND THE SAME ONE ON TARGET.COM, BUT IT WAS SOLD AS A BED-IN-BAG. THAT MEANT I GOT THE SHEETS AS WELL AS THE DUST RUFFLE AS WELL AS THE SHAM. PURCHASING THRU YOU, I HAD TO BUY SEPARATELY ALL OF THOSE THINGS. I AM VERY UNSATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE AND WISH I HAD SEEN THE TARGET OFFER FIRST AND I WOULDNT HAVE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY GATHERING THE WHOLE SET."
1,"""Soldiers' Pay"" is Nothing But Talking Heads: Read a Good Book Instead","Despite the fact that the DVD box shows imagery of soldiers in Iraq, this documentary consists almost entirely of talking heads, filmed in living rooms and on streets in the U.S. The heads are talking about the war, and they all give pretty much the same information you could hear from anyone else who reads a newspaper, or knows someone who's been over there, or who reads more than a few current-events blogs. The speakers are not particularly articulate (except for one ex-Marine officer), and -- really -- any random Joe sitting around a coffee shop could deliver a more convincing and tightly argued anti-war polemic. This DVD is all talk, talk, talk. I would suggest you read one of the many good books that have been written about the war, pro and con. I mean, if all you want is words."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film. But after viewing it, I was disappointed. It is a great story, but the dialog is weak and sometimes borders on bad banter. I noticed several changes in Harvey Keitel's German accent. The adaptation from stage to film should have been smoother, as many of the lines seem forced. I did appreciate the tone and the horrible images portrayed in the movie. The cinematography is wonderful and David Arquette is quite good. This film just didn't stand up to Schindler's List. Just my opinion!!"
3,Fair movie,"Great cast, great realism in the depiction (I have been to Auschwitz and I am a History Major) but the movie was a bit somber and bounced around but overall it was a fair movie."
2,The Holocaust was bad?,"I went into this movie expecting to see something I hadn't seen. There are alot of cool actors in here, so I was expecting some good characters too. Well, there is nothing in this movie you haven't seen before. There is absolutely NO visual style at all. There is no soundtrack. Every shot is hand held. This would make a good HBO movie, but it's pretty average. Who are we supposed to root for? I don't think we're supposed to root for the Nazis. How can we root for the Jews who are fighting against the other Jews to get ""special privileges""? There is really no character development, I never learned anyones name and it was sort of difficult to figure out what the plot was about. With only 2 powerful scenes at tops, this movie can't dig itself out of the average pit."
4,Interesting,"I found the movie interesting, although the dialogue was a bit too ""David Mamet"" for the subject matter. Someone may want to tell Sean Axmaker, the Amazon reviewer, that Auschwitz was and remains to this day in Oswiecim, Poland, rather far from Hungary."
2,Special Cables Needed,"This KVM should not be sold without cables. Special cables are needed and they are expensive if you buy them individually. Though it may be a great device, if you can't connect it, why bother. The same unit is available with cables. I had to return this unit without actually hooking it up. I may get the same unit with the cables but will first look for one that can use regular KVM cables."
3,Needs Cables!,"There are many of these IOGear KVM's on amazon, many with, and some without, cables. Be aware you need to buy the cables for this unit! so far it looks very pretty sitting on my desk. Once I get the cables for it, I may get some use out of it.* Update From April '09. Cables purchased, it's been working reliably in the server rack for a year. No glitches, happy."
4,Siempre La Trevi,"Porque solo cuatro estellas? Pues Ella siempre esta mejorando su talento y ""Me Siento Tan Sola"" y ""Mas Turbada Que Nunca"" son de cinco. Pero hay que tener este disco en su coleccion tambien. Como me gusta ""Pelo Suelto"", ""Virgin De Las Virgenes"", ""Tu Angel De La Guarda"", ""Hoy Me Ire De Casa"" y ""Agarrate"". Gozala!"
5,College campus based comic strips,"The first half of this paperback collection is made up of selected single-panel cartoons from Doug Teaster's Timothy series of the 1970s. The second half contains all Doug Teaster's Wimpel Hall comic strips published in college campus newspapers from 1985 through May of 1987. The early cartoons reflect the cartoonist's youth, but the campus strips are of a completely different genre. Though tame by today's standards, many of the Wimpel Hall strips were actually censored by the Arkansas Traveler before being offered for nationwide syndication. Any fan of the Wimpel Hall series will want this book. If you don't remember the series from college, here's a chance to complete your education."
3,"Not one of Abe's best, but worth a read","Having read Abe's ""Woman in the Dunes"" (a masterpiece) already, I was expecting a strange story filled with odd characters and challenging situations. However, I felt that the book wasn't as tightly written as I expected. He changes perspective and has some characters that meld together which are confusing. There didn't seem to be a satisfactory explanation of the character's motivation or actions. There is also a bizarre sexual element that doesn't seem to pay-off. The book is an interesting read, but I would recommend that you read ""Women in the Dunes"" as it is a far better novel."
3,"just okay, nothing spectacular","I bought this product for chocolate milk. I found it neither better, nor worse than any old store-brand chocolate syrup. It's perfectly acceptable but not worth the huge online markup. I think a lot of regional nostalgia is driving the raving 5 star reviews."
5,Fox's U-Bet is the BEST,"You can believe what everyone here is saying....for an Egg Cream, Fox's U-Bet is the BEST. I have never been to New York - but - there is a soda fountain located at the Beach Club Hotel in Disney World which I have visited ""many"" times and on their menu they have the ""Original New York Egg Cream"" and the taste cannot be duplicated with any syrup other than Fox's U-Bet. You can make a good egg cream with just about any chocolate syrup, but if you want it to taste like the ones you get at a soda fountain ""this"" is the syrup you need. And it's sooooo easy to make. I've been trying for years to make an egg cream at home that tastes like the ones I get at Disney World and I am finally able to do it. There's just something about this syrup - the taste is unique - and it can't be beat. You won't be sorry if you order it because it's good just to put on top of ice cream too!"
1,I didn't get the product!!!,"Ok so here's what happened. I ordered the ""Degrassi Junior High- The Complete Collection"" and I got the box, but there where no dvd's. Now this may have been a first for this person, but I certainly was not happy (especially after paying $50.)So my review of the product...I didn't actually receive the product, just the box."
1,This is stupid....,"Another Teens go to school series, Like we need another one. It is supposed to be drama, but the acting is so bad, it will make you go to sleep."
4,This IS the complete DJH series.,"In response to the previous review, I wanted to point out that this box set contains the entire Degrassi Junior High series. There were only 3 seasons. The next season is when the show switched over to the ""Degrassi High"" title. So the next season is techinically season 1 of Degrassi High, not season 4 of Degrassi Junior High. Anyway, this series is great and full of nostalgia for all of us 80's kids. The only reason I give the discs 4 stars is because the quality of the dvd transfers is not very good. There is a lot of digital compression/artifacting that can be seen in the image. But this is not bad enough to keep you from enjoying watching these shows again."
2,Not for daily use,"I bought a set of these glasses. I was happy with the thick bottoms and thought they would be good sturdy glasses. They did not last a year. The bottoms never broke, but they all cracked along the top. I would not recommend these if you have children or teens that aren't careful with placing the glasses in the sink or dishwasher."
2,Break easily,I had these years ago and loved them--thick bottom seemed to cause no rings on wooden table. Searched high and low to replace--and was happy to find them. BUT did they change the thickness???? Now they're thin glass and break at the drop of a hat. I'm going back to the Manchester tartan glasses--thick enough for everyday use.
4,"My first ""complete"" Messiah","This was given to me as a birthday gift on vinyl in the late 70's. I found Audio Spectrum's 1987 CD release in a Salvation Army thrift store a few years ago and snapped it up. For all the differences between the many recordings of this work (and there are SO many worth giving at least one listen), this one is my favorite. Probably for all of the same reasons already stated by other posters here. I noticed that the sound quality on the CD is markedly improved over the vinyl release. I'd love to hear from anyone who can compare Audio Spectrum's disc with this Madacy one. After having purchased a few of their video offerings, I'm a little leary."
5,Handel's Messiah,"Everyone is familiar with The Hallelujah Chorus, but how many people have listened to the entire symphony? It is exquisite!"
1,"One foot in Laos, one wild imagination elsewhere","The idea that this woman has somehow 'discovered' Laos in 1997 - some 22 years after its fall, is simply ludicrous. By the way, Laos has been open to those who care to enter it with an open heart and mind for some time.I wonder if she actually went to the places she talks about? What the US did there was horrible and some Yankees need to wake up to this. But her hatred is pervasive, you can feel it. I couldn't imagine going through life with such a cluster of inbuilt fear and loathing.Still, Laos is a great place to visit. Go the country and not the book."
1,Too much Roche - not enough Euripides,"Roche's translations of Euripides' tragedies are intrusive. He adds stage directions and characterizations that influence how the reader views the people in the plays. Readers may believe that these stage directions are from Euripides, but most of them are not. I find it irksome having to differentiate between Roche's interpretation of character and Euripides' text."
4,I love this album,What can I say? I am a sucker for sexy MTV videos. But I am glad that I bought this anyway. Some great tracks! RIP Robert P. He died before his time.
2,Hooky? Yes. Good? No.,"Palmer's schlock rock is appealing in kind of a guilty way, but he's one of the artists where you'd rather have the Weird AL parody version, his lyrics are that inane. His eighties hard pop posturing is similar in tone to J Geils or ZZ Top, although more generic than either. The big track is `Simply Irresistible' which isn't. `Change is Ways' steals it's riff from `The Lion Sleeps Tonight', but Palmer even flubs this infectious sound. If you feel the need to own some of this stuff, I'd suggest a comp, no Robert Palmer stands up to repeat listening."
1,SUCKS,"I really think this show sucks cuz it has bad character development, all the characters have no personality, and its filled with cliches that never evolve into anything new. The story lines are very repetitive and never go anywhere....I really wish this series was cancelled"
5,I love smallville,I had only seen bits and pieces of Smallville before on tv and did not know whatI was missing! After I bought the first season I couldn't believe what I hadbeen missing! What a great show!
5,A Super Show,"Not having access to a WB affiliate I have had to watch the show after its release on video. This is the best treatment of Clark Kent since Lois and Clark - even better than the comic books I loved as a kid.Clark's early years as portrayed in the Superboy comics - besides focusing on Superboy and virtually ignoring Clark - treated him as a mature man in a smaller body. The Clark of Smallville has all of the problems of a teenager: periods of doubt, times when he feels defiant toward his parents, teenaged angst, the initial euphoria when he discovers his X-Ray vision. Clark is a real teenager!The characters are three-dimensional, and the weekly format gives the writers time to let them grow and develop, and for us to have time to get to really know them.Good job, WB!"
4,Fair enough,"Now the only problem I really have with smallville is that you pretty much know where it all leads in the end. Like we all know what eventually happens between Lex and Clark which is semi annoying now seeing as how Lex is such a likeable character in smallville.The cast is great. Tom Welling makes a perfect Clark Kent. Kristen Kruek as clark's love intrest is also good although at times her acting is a bit flat. Then a few minor roles are clarks pals pete and chloe. But I think the stand out actor here is Michael Rosenbaum who plays Lex Luthor. It's just hard to beleive that he turns into clark's arch enemy in the future.As for the DVD Set it's pretty basic really. Some nice extra's but nothing that amazing other than the actual eps. Of the 13 only 1 episode stands out as being bad, the rest are all quite good."
5,Best movie of the decade.,This is the best series that I have ever seen. Clark is a sexy man and eveeybody should own this series.
5,Super Show,"I never watched it when it was out, but now that I have seen the first season I can see why it lasted 9 seasons I can't wait to watch them all.."
1,Buyer Beware,"This book is a poorly written and factually ""challenged"" libertarian diatribe, trying to pass itself off as Smart Growth. I was fooled by the misleading title and mistakenly ordered this book, which contains chapters extolling the role of the automobile in society, and containing some really intriguing ecological work describing the overpopulation of deer in suburbia as evidence of ""wildlife diversity"". This publishing company is a front supported by ""free-market"" supporting industry (read: no bothersome regulatory laws) which produce pseudo-science tracts such as this one."
3,Just sheep heart dissection,"If you are learning about the heart structure, this will be helpful. However, it hardly shows any other stuff. It begins with very brief narration about comparative anatomy (but not much in details) and moves quickly to the sheep heart. In later scenes, it shows how tissue samples are prepared for microscopy. This will be nice because many students may not have seen a microtome or related processes. If it could be borrowed form a library (as I did), it is worth watching, but not buying (especially at the price here-around 20 bucks)."
2,Mediocre anthology,"I found the concept of three separate stories by three different authors all centered around the same group of friends in the same setting to be very cool!These are typical romance mini-novels, where the protagonists stubbornly push each other away because of silly misunderstandings and annoying bickering, with conflicts that could very easily and amicably be resolved with open communication and better dialogue.I had a hard time maintaining my interest - also I kept having to remind myself that these were contemporary westerns, because they had many elements (particularly male chauvinism) usually found in historicals."
5,Keep representin' Da Fort AP,"Amanda is a Fort Wayne, Indiana artist and I wanna give my shout outs to her. Keep reppin dA fORT. aIIGHTHER CD IS TIGHT GO AND GET IT"
1,Only one good song!,"I loved the song Angel I thought she put a lot of expression in that one song. But, the rest of the songs are meaning less! Do not buy the cd, for that one song! Get that song somewhere else! Do not be disapointed!"
2,is this for real?,"horrible! dont waste your money, you will be disapointed. Amanda obviously has connections in the industry and utilized them to produce this cd its horrendous.. shes talentless her voice is average and strange! it sounds like she has a speech pathology. she hyperextends all the endings of her words and her style or (lack of) is repetative throughout the cd. some good advice Amanda; phonetics does wonders for people who have difficulty sounding out words....."
3,What!? How is this possible?,How could one put together a Maury Yeston Songbook cd without a track from Andrea Marcovicci? He wrote a song cycle for her. Granted there are some great singers here but a grave oversight to not include Ms Marcovicci.
1,"was a miniature size of what I thought I was getting, looks much bigger online - DO NOT BUY THIS COMPLETELY MISLEADING","when I saw it online I tought I was getting a normal size calculator when I got it in the mail it was a tiny size you can hardly see the numbers and its completely worthless, not worth the money I spent on it could have gotten the same thing from my local 99 cent store - DO NOT BUY THIS. very disappointed with this purchase."
2,Gets too hot,"I've had these for a year now and they consistently get too hot even when baking under 400 degrees farenheit. They don't burn your hands but it gets uncomfortably warm and you feel like you need to put the pan down very quickly to avoid burning yourself. I would NOT recommend. Otherwise, the mitts themselves held up well and still looks good."
2,"Difficult, but not impossible","I was very excited when I ordered these. My 20-year-old potholders had long since disintegrated, and I had been using two washcloths to remove hot pans from the oven. Each time, I was sure I would end up burning myself and dropping the pan. The mitts arrive, and I could hardly wait to try them on. It never occurred to me that I might not be able to use them. After all, there were no moving parts, no batteries, and they HAD to be better than using two washcloths. Could they be so bad that I would have to return them?... Impossible! Then I put them on. No... That's not quite right. I TRIED to put them on, but I couldn't get my hands into them. They were too small. I would have given them ONE star, but in all honesty, I'm sure that they would function quite well for those with hands smaller than mine. So much for oven mitts being one-size-fits-all (sigh)."
1,Dictionary of Contemporary Spain,"I was completely disappointed when I received my copy of this book. Had I read the discription a little better I might have been forewarned that it was a very small and short book. The information in the book, what there was of it, was good; probably 4 to 5 stars, but at $90 + it was a complete rip off. I was expecting a large library type reference book, this one is quite the opposite. I returned the book immediately. Well, I did puruse it a bit first. If money isn't an issue, it is a nice ""little"" book."
5,awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,got the ring in excellent condition and was shipped to me very fast!!!! awesome service!!!
5,"Looks good on my rig,",Nice looking cables to patch my Triton into my Kronos. No degradation of sound in such a short run. Angles keep guitar players from backing into cables and damaging the jacks.
3,"Stinky, but works.","Keeps water warm... HOT for a long time, but I can only give it 3 stars since it stunk like a gas station for months! Gross!"
3,district b13,Action pack incredible fight scene the acrobatic are off the hook the story could have been better its a good buy amazon has it all
3,Meh. It's ok.,"There are a number of *really* *great* fight scenes, but overall this is a pretty vapid piece of work."
2,Even worse in English,"This is a slick commercial and very mediocre french action film directed by Luc Besson. Filled with cliches from other films, and basically an excuse for some neatly choreographed fight and chase scenes. For me, what little enjoyment there was to be derived from this was ruined by the English dubbing -- a seemingly random hodgepodge of lifelyess English, American, Irish and even, in one case latino-american accents. I watched this on Amazon live video, and would have really appreciated the opportunity to view with subtitles instead."
2,CORNY,"It was ok , But a little week and corny for me. not one guy is invincable but 2 are invincable LOL"
2,"Dated, very dumb plot","We watched this with high hopes, given the buzz this film had. Aside from a few thrilling parkour scenes, the film was a boring mess. Very poor dubbing and plot holes you can drive the Titanic through. Just fast forward to the fight/chase scenes and you might be entertained."
5,"Intense, original action!","If you're a fan of kung fu action flicks, you'll love this movie. Its actually really easy to enjoy. It contains no nudity, just action, and is a great movie that conveys a positive message to the audience. The story is a little uninspiring, but all the flaws could be ignored due to the explosive action scenes which include outstanding coryography. This movie gives you a whole different perspective on the French. After watching this movie, you might respect the Franks more than you ever did before."
2,Not what I expected,"I stopped reading this book by chapter 2. There are parts that are very humorous, however, the author gives details on various things she or people she interviewed that scared the ""you know what"" out of me. Every symptom that she described, I swore I was developing. There may be some women out there who want to know all of this stuff, but not me. I have other books that aren't as graphic as this one and are making my pregnancy more enjoyable. If I could return this book for a full refune, I would."
5,Love at first bite,"Our cats love these treats. The texture seems nice, and if they were in a human flavor I would eat them myself.There are two different color tones, one a light brown and the other and more red tone.I'm not sure if they are different flavors or not. One thing I have noticed is my cats always seem to prefer the more red toned food, whether with these treats or with the red tones in normal cat food."
4,Great Story,"This book is very interesting, exciting, and romantic. The characters are well developed. The author is very descriptive, the dialog is easy to read and at time humorous. I'm trying to read the entire ""Dark Series"". Fantastic!"
3,Dark Secret,I think this book could have been better. Yes Rafael was a very very dominant male. He did not understand what it was to have a lifemate. He just knew that to keep the darkness away he had to convert colby. He and his brothers lived with their own set of laws. I think some people are judging him too harshly. I think he was closer to turning than his brother and it was very urgent that he convert her.I did not feel any love between them only the urgency for him to convert and for her the urgency to run away. He seemed not to know anything about how the conversion would affect her or what would happen. I didn't understand why the other Carpathians did not inform him.
2,"i totally agree with L. J. Russell ""fangirl"" SORRY!","I love paranormal romance. its mainly what i read. i have read all of feehans work and honestly this one got lost in translation. Lately ive been noticeing the climax in feehans stories have been short lived and leaves you with 100 more pages of muddled ""same stuff"" garbage. If you take a look at her recent carpathian novels, you notice the same wording, and plots. Honestly its dishearting because i love her books. maybe she should just stop while she is ahead?"
1,This could've been a good book...,This could have been a good book but the main characters ruined it. I like a strong heroine as much as the next gal but Colby was just annoying. I found myself rolling my eyes every time she couldn't understand or was afraid of pretty much everything. I don't think I've ever read a story with a more dense or stubborn female character. Things have to go her way or she has a b***h fit unwilling to see reason or common sense. Raphael was just very one dimensional and more of a caveman then 18th century hunter/warrior.The story dragged on forever it could easily have been half the length. The sex scenes were too long and too frequent. I liked the idea of the story but I couldn't get past my dislike for the main characters. I had never read a Feehan book before and unfortunately this one hasn't made me want to take a chance on another.
3,I have to agree with Michelle L. Phillips and L.J. Russell,"I'm also a great fan of Christine Feehan's work. I've read almost all of the Dark Series and I have to agree that the sex scenes... well... they just don't quite cut it. The plots seem to all be the same and the books have started running together for me... instead of leaving a lasting impression. I did enjoy this one because Colby was a farm girl like myself, but other then that it left me wanting more in the romance department. Maybe she needs to take a break on the Dark series for a while and try concentrating on her other series. There's 17 or 18 books in this series and no more then 5 or 6 in the Leopard, Ghostwalker, and Drake Sisters series. Maybe she's just burnt out on the Dark series for the time being?"
4,really good,Love this series! Usually they are basically the same but somehow Feehan seems to throw in a curve that I wasn't expecting.
5,Great Read,I hope that Christine Feehan will continue the Dark Series by following up on the next generations to come within this series
1,Definitely the worst ever,"I usually can't put down a Feehan, despite the overused metaphors...one more brush of butterfly wings, or molten lava reference and I'll send her a thesarus). This on I can't pick up...how much of an arrogant jerk is this guy, expecting her to giv up her home and family for his, ordering a 12 year out of bed to make vegetable soup for his unwilling lifemate.....Throw this bum to the sunlight, and let Colby live with her brother and sister."
3,Buy only if you need it for school paper.,Its a lot of information that is somewhat boring. Huge book about Abigail Adams and I'm amazed that someone found her interesting enough to write so much about her.
4,modernizing the duo,If you like the trinity series of movies this will be an enjoyable film. It brings the duo into a more modern setting.
2,!!!!!!!Better to buy an empty home & fill it yourself and possibly a bigger one!!!!!!!,"This home is great! Calico critters are precious!! However if you are focused on details for your little one it can be aggravating! This home comes with furniture BUT in order to complete rooms you will end up duplicating the items as the counterparts to the pieces included are only sold as sets with the ""free"" items in them. Christmas is too close to send this back but if I were to do this again I would find the home(empty and maybe the mansion) and buy the sets to fill it as desired!!! The structures material is like that of the playmobil homes."
5,Great show!,"Wish it didn't take so long for these to come out on video in the US! This show is really fun, even for those of us who aren't real car enthusiasts. The hosts and the segments/challenges are top notch."
2,A complete and absolute waste of money,"I bought this book expecting a good and entertaining read as I got from most of Bertrice Small's previous books (and I've read them all). I was terribly dissapointed in the characters, no depth or real personality at all. Someone else mentioned they couldn't imagine Skye prostuting herself for an English title and I couldn't agree more. I've given this book two stars and those stars go to the character of Skye, whose ghost chased the English nobility who were living in her home out. It's pretty bad when a ghost is the most interesting character in a book like this.I won't be rushing out to buy future Bertice Small books and paying $18-$20 (CDN), I'll just wait until they make it to the library where if the book was terrible, at least I got my money's worth."
1,Poor Effort,"Redundant, poorly written, boring and disappointing. I would not recommend to any serious reader of history . A more scholarly work would have been preferable."
2,dull and muddled,"I had to return this book. It was very difficult to get through. I believe I could have read the entire book, but decided against it. After reading about 100 pages, I thought that continuing to read the rest would be a big waste of my time. The book is so cluttered with random facts and famous people that everything becomes muddled. The beginning of the book has a list of random famous people that lived in New York from the 1880's-1920's. Some chapters read like a six degrees of Kevin Bacon game, except with Rothstein as the degree of separation."
1,This product does NOT work!,I bought this product thinking that it would help me with my anxiety attacks and problems so I decided to give it a try bein that I can't see a doctor about it because I don't have any insurance at this moment and I must say it just was a waste it does not work at ALL!! And I just think it made me feel worst rather than better.....
1,Junk. Don't bother.,"I only got to use this one or two times before it jammed for good. The plastic gears are a mistake -- look for one with metal gears, even if you have to pay more. Like the other reviewer, I only use an egg beater occasionally, so I didn't want to make a huge investment. The one I had before was the one my mother used for 40+ years. Alas, it finally rusted beyond repair so I had to find another. This wasn't it. I'll keep looking."
2,The humming bridge,"I know that this is a very commonly used item with most framers, but being a G/C myself, I wouldn't use these again. Although very easy to use (much easier than cutting wood blocking), it leaves an unsettling hum whenever someone jumps on the floor above. Unless you are using insulation in all your floors, I wouldn't recommend this bridging."
2,Aimed at the rental market.,"I love this series, and was looking forward to having it on DVD, but two things will keep me from buying this set: First, the price is just too high. List price is $100 for 12 hours? Consider that sets like West Wing have 22 hours at a much lower price. Second, disk 1 starts with one of those self-promoting HBO montages that CAN'T be skipped past and has to be endured each time you put disk 1 in the player.Clearly this set is being aimed at the rental market. I will wait and hope for a set that is packaged more for consumers."
2,Big Love: Season 1,"Horrible show ~ mundane and subject is boring. The sexual content is redundant and over-done. I was really disapointed because I like the actor very much, on the whole. That was why I subscribed to the video.Much to do about nothing is as good a review as I could come up with."
5,great dog food,"Our english bulldog has allergies and this dog food with limited ingredients helps keep her skin "" normal"" and she likes it."
4,Low Residue,"My dog loves this food and I like it because it's low residue and doesn't upset his tummy. Less waste when he goes makes it more comfortable for him and easier to pick up for me. The only complaint (besides the price!) would be the smell of the food if you sniff it. It doesn't make his breath smell. I may try the lamb one next time (to compare smells), but I definitely recommend this food."
1,An abomination that must be stopped,"I love Gal Costa but HATE this album. I am deeply disturbed that one of my favorite Brazilian singers could sink to such lows as employing these abysmal Holiday Inn Lounge-style cheesy synthesized keyboards. The only track even remotely listenable is #6, Bem-Bom. I'm going to make ever effort to return this CD, and if I can't get a refund, I'm going to do my civic duty of destroying it, because to allow it to circulate would be the height of cruelty."
5,Antonia Forest,I have loved the Antonia Forest books since I accidentally found them in my local library when I was a child. I totally agree with the other reviewers - the books are excellent and it is very sad that they are out of print. As a comprehensive school child with no experience at all of life in a boarding school I nevertheless was entranced by the characters and the unfolding stories. I would love my daughter to read them and so I'm trying to collect them!
4,Good book on American dolls,This is a very nice book for collectors of American composition dolls. Most books cover this area in less detail.
4,very nice,"It's very nice and it's a great price. The cheapest I saw at stores was about $35 so this is a great buy. However, it is smaller than the average, but it's nice looking."
4,Cake plate with dome is just lovely.,"The cake plate with dome was a gift to my sister. We love the look of it and the dome is very heavy. The only thing I was disappointed with is the base. The foot of the cake stand is glued to the plate. I don't like that because I had a cake stand like that before and the foot came off when I washed it in hot water. It would be better if the cake stand was all one piece. Otherwise, we were very please with it."
3,NOt what I expected,"I wanted a more engaging and elaborate book on Greek Mythology. this books seems to be a little too rushed and the stories a bit too short. however, it does do its job, so i am satisfied with the product."
5,Great blues/rock DVD,"This is one of those guys who deserved better.He is pratically unkown, but is an excelent guitarrist.What you get in this DVD is hard rocking band, very tight and playing loud, very good drummer (a young girl), very good bass player and Aynsley playing great! OK, I don't think his vocals are that great, but it's not bad at all.Though it's a small crowd, the camera work is excelent and the sound too.My favorites here are Everything I Need, Angel O'Mine and the extended version of Sometimes It Gets To Me.Unfortunately, it's from 2004, so some of his best songs are not represented here.Well, if you're interested, I recommend his CDs ""Everything I Need"" (has an excelent song named ""Without You"", among others), and his last two ""Equilibrium"" and ""Tower Sessions"".This DVD has become one of the favourites in my collection. If you like rock/blues I strongly recommend it. Shame it's out of print (if your DVD plays PAL, you can buy the european version on amazon.co.uk)."
2,Could've been better,"The game is too easy to beat. The computer throws no curves during races (No blocks, pockets, or bumps). Would have been awesome if Radish Works would have made it more like Horse Illustrated by added grooming, feeding, tacking, and stable work. And actual training work would have made it almost perfect."
4,Edges,Were are better price than local hard ware str.Fit the shelf.Holds the shelfhard to say much more
4,a fantasy comes alive,"My major is English Literature and i studied this opera intensively, it was a thrill to see it in high class movie while keeping its originality as a theatrical Opera.. I really enjoyed it."
5,I'm sticking with monster cables,"this is my second cable from monster, and I've yet to have a problem. The cables have virtually eliminated my fret buzz. The cable was shorter than I thought it would be, I misread the description. no matter, I just use it to link pedals together. I'm glad there is solid encasings at the end of the cable so that I don't have to pull it out by the cord. Highly recommended"
3,"Decent, but Greene's other books are better.","I wasn't really impressed by this book as much as I was by 48 Law of Power. The Art of Seduction was more of a history book that wasn't very well organized. Don't get me wrong, you'll probably be able to pick up a few tips and tricks from this book, but if you want more of a manual on seduction, check out some other authors (Neil Strauss, etc). Art of Seduction is decent, but I really just should have spent my time re-reading The 48 Laws of Power."
1,"Very thick, long detailed book.",Could someone please write cliff notes for this book? It could easily be two books. I suggest skipping the first half and maybe read the second... or maybe just read The System by roy valentine instead.
1,The Art of Seduction,I have tried to get an Order # for this purchase and nothing comes up. My credit card was charged but the book was never received. Can you please provide me with the sellers info.
3,Disappointed,"This cd is not what I expected from DAC. I've always liked DAC's outlaw music, but this cd doesn't do a thing for me. He talks,instead of singing his old hits such as ""You Never Even Call Me By My Name"",""Long Haired Redneck""etc. The new songs on the cd are alright, but I don't see any hits coming out of these songs. On the brighter side, the lead guitarist is impressive with his rock and country licks. ""Storms Never Last"", a tribute song to his best buddies Waylon & Jessie is passable but not impressive. There's a lot of cd's out there by DAC that are far superior than this one. Guitar Bob"
2,Makes the SDK documentation look sagely by comparison.,"One of the big reasons for reaching for a book on DirectX programming is that while the SDK documentation and examples are generally complete in content, they leave you wanting for both the 'big picture' and for a strategic feel for how to adapt DirectX for your specific needs.This book does nothing to help bridge that gap. The author makes early assumptions about the sort of program you want to write, then goes about writing wrapper classes that obscure all of the functional features of DirectX just to fit his unhelpful viewpoint. You'll spend most of your time with this book trying to track down what DirectX functions are called when, and if they're really necessary, or just the excess baggage of the author's desire to use the same code example for the entire text"
