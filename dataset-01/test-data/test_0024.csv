2,Palm M500,"the palm came in timely, the language was Japanese. It does not seem to want to charge up all the way."
1,Software?,"Looking for some 'cheap' electronic organizers, I came across this one. The floor model was on sale, so it made it a great deal. The software was not included and I wasn't told that I needed software to make it work with my computer. The sales associate made it sound as the Palm would install the needed components on my computer. No where on the box did it mention a CD-ROM to install.With this lack of software, this thing is pretty much useless."
3,PalmOne m500 Handheld,"While the palm handheld works fine, it does not seem to have good background light that my previous one had. Therefore, I only rate it at three stars."
4,"Good, basic product","I searched for a long time to find a PDA. I did not need something with all the fancy features, just something to keep my appointments and to-do list. The Palm m500 does just that. I am fortunate because I decided to buy a refurbished m500. Most I looked at were $100 minimum and I found mine for $20. It is a great product for $20, do not spend any more than that! It is not worth it! It is a basic unit that was difficult to sync to my computer. This would be equivalent to paying $100 or more for a VCR. As far as me buying a refurbished m500, I got what I expected. A few scratches on the back, the screen was fine, and one of the scroll buttons does not work. No manual came with it, but that was easily remedied by going to the Palm website and downloading one. The m500 works great, it just isn't worth paying the big bucks. For most people, their smart phone will do what they want. My preference is to have something separate."
1,Steer clear.,"Even though I took very careful care of my m500, it was completely non-functional in 2 months. It's replacement was also carefully cared for, and was dead in less than a month, as was my third Palm replacement. Through the ordeal, Palm support ranged from inept to hateful, and you can shoot me if I ever buy another Palm product. The device that is supposed to help keep me on track is way too important for this kind of shoddy quality."
3,PamOne m500 handheld,This is a replacement for the Palm Zire for me. I liked the visibility of the Zire better. This is easy to use.
2,PDA,"There is no back light. I'm not able to use several of the functions since it did not come with an owner's manual. I tried the email address for help but got no response. It will not sync with my computer, though it says that it has. All in all, not too pleased with this purchase, which is odd since most items I purchase from Amazon.com have been great."
4,Edges out Edge.,"If you're comparing this with the more attractively priced Handspring Edge, the Palm has the advantage for convenience and compactness. Not only is it a tad smaller and lighter, but once you've opened the attached cover of the Handspring, you've in effect doubled its surface area (the hinge prevents folding it all the way back). Sufficiently cumbersome and inconvenient that I'm returning the Edge. If light is right, pay the extra for the Palm m500; if value is paramount, it's hard to argue against the Handspring Deluxe."
2,Eh,"It's supposed to be for adults, but it's clearly marketed for kids with the irritating hardcover/dustjacket and the actual content. There's nothing particularly gruesome, especially in the context of even normal fairy tales, and in at least one case they seemed to have interpreted the story wrong: when Allerleirauh ran away, she was found by ANOTHER king, not her father. The story doesn't make any sense that way.Not a particularly impressive book for anyone seriously interested in fairy tales, and not quite interesting enough for someone who's just bored."
5,Not your father's fairy tales,"I like to tell bedtime stories to my granddaughters, but I'd never read one of these tales to them! This book shows quite well why the authors had the last name ""Grimm"", for most of these tales are grim indeed. There's murder, maiming, mutilation, incest, and just about every other evil device you can imagine. It's possible to recognize some of our own versions of these tales, but they are certainly changed from the originals! Reading this book is like passing a gruesome auto accident: you don't want to slow down and look, but you just can't help yourself. I recommend a very strong stomach for anyone wishing to read theis book."
5,Christopher's Opinion,"This is a CD re-issue of some historic recordings made by the great Russian pianist and composer, Sergei Rachmaninoff. A bonus inclusion is a recording of Rachmaninoff's last work, ths Symphonic Dances, Op. 45, played by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir Eugene Goossens, another great and historic recording.Although the CD cover has a disclaimer regarding the sound quality, it seems unnecessary, as the quality is excellent, even though some of the recordings were made over 70 years ago.If I remember correctly, the Symphonic Dances were also recorded about 50 years ago.The performances by these two great icons of the 20th century music world cannot be faulted and Rachmaninoff's performances of his own pieces gives pianists an invaluable insight into the correct interpretation of these works.Rated 5/5."
2,piano rolls,"These recordings are taped from piano rolls - it's a machine reproducing Rachmaninoff's performances, not the original records. But still, it was poorly done."
3,Looking for a Reference book?,"I bought this book for reference but when I wanted to look at the bones and muscles in detail, the pictures were too dark and not clear. I ended up buying ""The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing : A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition"""
4,Detailed and exhaustive infromation on anatomy,"This book is definitely a classic when it comes to anatomy books. Its very detailed, with lots and lots of information and text to read. It goes through everything including body shapes and weight, including the aging of the body. The photos are a bit dated from the 1950's, but still usable as a source of reference. If there's one drawback to this book (the reason I only gave 4 stars) is that its very boring, not really very inspiring, sometimes I find myself making an effort to get into it. Its also good for the beginner if they can get past those facts. Though for the low price its a really good value.PROS:-lots of diagrams and information-very complete anatomy manual-very detailed-can be used by beginner and advanced-really good value for the moneyCONS:-old and dated-boring and uninspiring"
1,not recommended!,The book is not readable because the notaionis very confusing and it is very easy to get lost due to this carelesnotation. The objective is not clear at most places and the book does not provideany intitution. It is not suitable for self-study.Poeople in the field of system identification should try other books.
5,pass the dutchie,"I think this cd is so not appriciated. it took me forever to find it, but sence I have, I can't stop listening to it! It's classic reggae with a youthful flavor added to make it one of the most original of it's kind. If you like old school reggae or dance hall, you'll love this cd! Have a listen...it may just bring back memories..."
3,"Looks good, quality just ok","This Brewers lamp is hard to rate. I LOVE how it LOOKS, but the quality is just ok. It's a bit smaller than I pictured it would be. The lamp shade is connected to the base VERY poorly and after a few months the lamp shade already fell off, there is not a way to fix it, I'll have to take it in some where. So, because of the shade and having to deal with finding a place to fix it, I would have to say that I wouldn't have bought it (even though I still think it's the nicest looking one out there)."
4,"Evolution, Religion...","This documentary is a testimony to manipulative behaviour of human beings in regard to religion which regardless it is the same manipulative behaviour when it comes to politics or any other issue. Science and religion, what a provocative mix when you have to find a middle ground."
1,Well...,"It's better than a 1-star, perhaps a four, but the film did make false assertions about claims which Intelligent Design makes, such as the idea that all living systems happened abruptly(that's not at any degree essential for ID); moreover, the film strayed too far from the actual court case for me to believe that it had no ulterior motives. The bias was rather blatant, but I wasn't expecting a neutral discussion of the topic from NOVA, anyway. At least there are more reliable sources of information. It was fair."
1,Tooooo expensive,In stores you can by this pack for less than five dollars. 2 dollars on sale!Compare to normal price you are paying twice more and to sale price 5 times more + shipping.Way overpriced.Do not fool your self...
2,Old Yeller: Dog of the West,"Old Yeller is a story about a boy and his dog; Yeller. It tells about all the adventures they go through together.If you read it you will laugh, cry, and truly experience the story. I think this would not be a good book for people who don't like violence in books. On the other hand, people who do like violence in books, this book could teach you the effects of violence. The power of friendship is also shown in this book. It show that your best friend doesn't have to be human to be your best friend. To me Old Yeller was an average childrens story. I think my opinion of this book, however, may or may or may not be reasonable because stories at the reading level of this book usually bore me. But this book has many lesson to learn in it."
5,sad and beautiful book,it is amazing i am advanced reader i say it is more for 7 - 15 i love it brilliant book after the book watch the movie you might catch some tears but theres always a happy ending :)
3,An American Classic,"This classic is a real tear jerker. A boy ,on his way to man hood, is helped on his way by a stray dog. At first Travis [the boy mentioned before] dislikes old yeller because, well he is a trouble maker, and a theif. Old yeller wins Travis's heart by saving his family, Arliss [ brother] and his mother, from bears, wolves,mad cows, and even saves Travis from a bunch of nasty hogs looking to tear him apart. In the end old yeller couldn't ecscape the horrible plague of hydrophobia [ rapies] and Travis must take the lives of his family in his on hands, by killing old yeller."
5,Classic to the Core,"I learned a lot from reading this book for kids, like how to raise wild pigs and how to treat a septic wound with plants. Life in Texas was hard in the 19th century, and these poor ranchers and farmers had death at their doorstep...yet a 14 year old boy runs the farm while Dad is out of town. Mom is extremely competent too, and no one flinches at the hardness of life or the ever-present rabies epidemic. Sad ending was different than in the movie version.Then I made corn bread all week because of this book."
5,OLD YELLOW YELLER,"Old Yeller is a delightful story about a boy and his dog. The ending is so gut-wrenching. The subject may be overrused, but nevertheless, this story about the adventures a boy has with his mangy mutt, is a great read for everyone."
5,A Must For Every Generation,This is a time honored classic of a boy and the incredable bond he and his dog share. This has it all for anyone who can allow themselves to be swept away into into a life so foreign to most of us today. My daughter is hooked on it as I was as a child. A classic to pass from generation to generation.
5,lover of books,old yeller is a must read for all ages. it is a sad book but it is a heartwarming story of travis who falls in love with old yeller after old yeller saves his life. can travis do the same for od yeller? travis knows old yeller will be a big help on the farm with father gone. but will old yeller last that long? this a book that i have loved and so will you!
5,A Fantastic Story!!!!!,You can`t Judge a by it`s cover. The book is SO great. My Daughter LOVES Old Yeller I got it for her 11 birthday and I HAD to read it first first. It was such a good book!!!!
4,"Old Yeller ""BEST DOGONE DOG""","My assignment was to write about my opinion of Old Yeller and reasons why. I really liked this book. So I would rate it a 4. One reason why I like Old Yeller is because of the action such as the rampaging, destructive bull fight. Another, such as the javelina stampede that would have killed Travis and Old Yeller but they both survived. One more event comes up and that is the dog and the wolf fight. Travis had to be careful not to shoot Old Yeller. I sure hope that all of these reasons helped you know why I liked this book. There was one exception: I didn't make it a 5. That is it needed a little more action."
4,Nice!,It was the perfect present for my son. But please don't ask me to leave reviews anymore I don't have time to do it.
5,Awesome,It was very awesome and sad because old teller died and it was very heart warming and boss and sad
5,Old Yeller,"Old Yeller is a beautiful story about a boy and a dog. When they first meet they do not think they will be friends. However, over time they come to genuinely care for one another. Travis is a boy who has to grow up really quickly and Old Yeller needs a home. Although Travis does not realize it on their first encounter, he needs Old Yeller as much as Old Yeller needs him. They have many adventures together that really show that dog really is man's best friend.This is a wonderful book that can be enjoyed by both male and female of all ages. It gives a great lesson about how life is not always fair, but one must live life to the fullest and not dwell in the past. This book will make you smile, laugh and cry. It is captivating and makes you not want to put it down. crm3301"
1,"I'm sorry, not worthy of being a classic","This book was awful. There was absolutely no plot. I mean, Travis gets a dog, and they go fight some hogs. I mean, what's the incentive? This book was terrible because there was no plot therefore you weren't interested in what happened to the characters. Terrible terrible book."
1,not good,"poor acting, no script righting, bad cinematography, and creatively void of any entertainment value. life is short for watch such poor film making."
4,Excellent for reading out-loud to a young audience,"At this point I have read a large number of fantasy books to my young children (ages 3-7). The Rowan series stands out as above-average for out-loud reading to that age group:- The vocabulary was well suited to my listener(s) ages (with just enough advanced words to increase their vocabulary, but not so many that they lose the ability/interest to follow the story);- There was little violence, but plenty of suspense and monsters- The repetition of plot elements between books (mentioned as a negative in previous reviews) can be used as a tool to prompt young listeners into critical thinking and analysisIf you are a parent looking to read to your children, take a look at this series."
3,A caution,"I would recommend this book with a caution for Christian parents. There is an incident where Rowan endangers his own life because of his love for an animal, a bukshah. Bronden, a negative character in the story scolds Rowan saying, ""... would you endanger our lives and our quest for the sake of a dumb beast? What value is there in a bukshah's life, compared with a human one?"" Then Jonn, one of the ""good guys"" in the story interrupts Bronden saying, ""Leave the boy be ... You have reasons for what you say, I know. But not all share your views."" It is true that not all religions share the belief that human life is sacred above all other forms of life, however, my religion does. I love our family dog, but I would never teach my children that our dog's life is equal to, or more important than a human being's life. And I wouldn't want my children to be introduced to this way of thinking without my knowledge and opportunity to discuss it with them. Hence my caution to other Christian parents."
1,Recycled Classics,"I wish i had read the back of the album closer before buying it--i thought it was a dj mix, after hearing gerald's name mentioned on a local radio station--its just recycled soul classics with one or two interesting tracks thrown in--make sure youre a true fan of the genre before buying (i wonder why Virgin megastore had it on display in the electronica section????) Oh well, time to sell...."
4,Roots of racism,This paper exposes how the American early corporate structure a.k.a. slavery could be made to be less troublesome to the slavemaster class. If someone wants to know why African-Americans are sometimes distrustful of each other Willie Lynch's letter is imperative reading.
5,A Refreshing Solution to Dry Vocabulary Instruction,"I still remember when my high school teachers would assign the dreaded weekly vocabulary homework. We would painstakingly look up each word in the dictionary, write down what was usually the shortest definition, and then take a wild stab at writing the word in a sentence. I'm not sure how many of those words I actually learned, but I do remember being bored, frustrated and confused. Dictionaries are not necessarily the only tool for deriving meaning of new words.Thankfully, this book helps educators to realize the importance of meaningful vocabulary instruction. It outlines various techniques for robust instruction in both primary and secondary grade levels. If you teach vocabulary, you should consider this book for your collection."
4,I think that Joydrop is one of the best new bands out there!,"I saw Joydrop live, about a month before the cd came out. I think that they are defenitly one of the best new bands that are coming out. The lead singer is VERY talented and the basses and the drummer are just mad cool. I saw them in Worcester Mass at a club called ""The Espresso bar."" I got a free demo tape and was instantly hooked. I would defenitly recomend them to anyone! Nuttin but love and peaCe from matthewL!"
2,yikes,"I heard the song beautiful on the radio and loved it... then I bought the cd. somehow, I dont think that their other songs live up to the reputation ""beautiful"" has gotten. I'm not saying that its all bad... but if your buying the cd just because of just the song ""beautiful"" you might want to listen to some of their other songs first..."
5,The best,"JOydrop is a great band. They have a full range of sound, from garagy (Spiders, Fizz) to very peaceful (Until, Cocoon) Tara Slone is an amazimg singer, the guitar by Thomas Payne is unbelievable, the bass (Tom McKay) is very good, and the drums (Tony Rabalao) are very good as well. This is a very good singalong CD, especially ""Beautiful"" and ""Strawberry Marigold"". My favourite song, by far, is ""Breakdown"". In the middle there is a strings arrangement, which, gives the song an entire new dimension. It's a very powerful song.The best lyrics (I think) I written my Thomas Payne.Check out their new CD, ""Viberate"".They're very unusual in a world of Britneys and Pinks, this is my favourite CD I have. They're kind of a cross between Radiohead and Sloan."
3,Great movie but some how very strange,"I've wouldn't have given this 5 stars if it wern't for those strange parts.There where 2 parts that where strange number 1, those 3 millon year old statues that creep me out,and number 2,those weird ladies that where dancing that also creep me out.Despite all that this is a really cool movie.P.S. you reviewer man who ever you are how dare you talk about Godzilla that way, with those Godzilla haters and everything you SUCK!!!"
3,Finally!,Finally a wide-screen movie release of this classic B-Horror monster movie! Nothing can beat an old classic Godzilla film!Godzilla Vs Megalon
2,Not worth it!!,"The appearance of the wig and mustache was great, I actually used this item for my son in a church skit. My son actually portrayed some else. The wig was white so I had to dye it which really wasn't a problem. The main issue I had was with the mustache it did not stick at all. This may seem minor to some but it meant a great deal to me. When I purchase a product I want the full use of it not partial."
1,Workbook for 9 year olds,"This is an elementary school workbook designed to teach 9 year olds to plot whole numbers, up to 10, on a number line. For some odd-ball reason it also includes examples showing the wee bairns how to use simple addition nomographs: 5 + 3 = 8, etc. If your 4th grader needs these skills, go nuts.If you're looking for any discussion whatsoever about how to, oh I don't know, Make Nomographs, you will be utterly disappointed."
2,Are you kidding me?!,"This is being written by one of the most hard-core devoted Limp Bizkit fans on the planet so you know it must be bad!!Anyone that's ever seen a Limp show knows the energy in the arena or event, it's hard to capture that on a DVD I guess. I can certainly understand and see past that, what I can't understand is how the audio could be SO bad? Fred will sing and you see his lips move to the words but you don't actually hear the words for a good 2-3 seconds!!! It is very annoying to the point that I couldn't finish watching it.I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the old style Limp Bizkit (without Wes, who cares) to come back and give us a new album and maybe a good concert DVD...........We are waiting FRED!!!"
4,Fun film,"I've not read the book, so I cannot compare it to the movie. That said, I enjoyed the movie, and it actually roused my interest in the book. It's weird but fun to imagine little people making a living from 'borrowing' from ordinary people, and seeing the predicaments they have to deal with. Really cool idea. Overall fun movie."
4,Not bad,"This is a good CD. Not great, but not bad. Corey has a good voice, but it is not used enough on this cd, which consists of mainly dance tracks. However some slower songs like ""Bed Of Roses"" are very good. I do not think Corey should have included the track ""Paulatics"". Not because it is bad singing, but because it brings his accusations about Paula Abdul into his music, which could be a major turn-off to some listeners. Either you love Corey or hate him, but either way this CD at least deserves a chance.I recommend it."
5,Forget the AI drama- this CD is AWESOME R & B from this era's new El Debarge!,Whatever happened between him and Paula is irrelevant- I saw the special and was amazed at how much I liked the music he was recording and I promised myself I would buy his Cd when it came out- and I did. WOW! I LOVE this CD-I would even rate it one of the best R & B CDs in years! Corey has a gorgeous voice and reminds me of EL Debarge. The song So Many Questions is my favorite but the whole cd is REALLY good! Good work Corey! I love your work!
2,Music is an expression of who you are - and Corey's scum,"If you wanna make it all about the music and ignore the person behind it, feel free. A lot of people can't do that. Corey was the one who brought up all the stuff about Paula, who put ""Paulatics"" on the album and won't freakin shut up about her. He could have tried to sell the album on talent alone, but he didn't have the guts. Instead he went around telling people he banged Paula Abdul, smearing it everywhere in graphic detail, revelling in telling every dirty little detail to anyone who'd listen. Paula wasn't ever the world's greatest singer, but she got her eight Number One singles all on her own merits. Corey will never be able to say the same. He's not an artist I could ever respect or admire. Helping him get rich by buying his album isn't something I have the slightest inclination to do."
4,Not bad at all,"To judge this cd means to judge it only based on lyrics, beat, content, and flow. I believe for his first album he has much talent. With time he will be the bomb! I will buy this at the first chance I get. I love several of the songs on the album. When you can dig more than five songs on an album these days you got a legitimate cd. Keep doing your thing man. The cd is grooving. Can't wait for the second one."
1,corey clark has no talent,corey clark cannot sing. all the cheap publicity did not help him. he just simply cannot sing. his songs are laughfable and his cd is just a big fat joke. if you seek publicity at least have something to back it up. his 15 minutes of fame has lonf been over and his cd tanked miserably. who did he paid to give him 5 stars reviews? please let be honest i would not recommed it to anybody.
3,It's OK,"All the stones are very loose. I'm certain one of these days I'm going to loose one. A little uncomfortable at first, if there was one lest stone, it wouldn't hit the fingers around it."
3,Eh.... Good Tricking though,"If you are found of tricking (extreme martial arts) then this is kind of a fun movie to watch. Got some cool moves. However; in term of a good movie, it fails horribly. Story is horrible and terribly put together, scenes and shots aren't thought out therefore the movies is choppy and hard to watch. I used to make these kind of movies with my friends in High School, and yet mine still turned out better. My recommendation, youtube the fight scenes and call it a day."
2,Acting and plot actually gets in the way of this action movie,"the cliche' acting actually gets in the way of this movie. it is so cheesy it was hard to digest. the fight scenes (which is why you are going to watch this movie) were ok, but not up to the jackie chan or tony jaa standard. the plot was so unbelievable, I caught myself wanting to clean the house or do laundry or something while this movie played. the funny scenes were not funny at all. not really worth the purchase or even rental."
2,"Living Buddha, Living Christ","I received the book as a gift. I found it thoughtfully written, well intended, and engaging. Having more than a passing acquaintance with ""indigenous Buddhism"" and having lived a few blocks from one of the largest Buddhist Temples in North America ( a Thai Temple in L.A.)the author puts a very different ""Nouveau/California/New Age face on Buddhism. His quotations from the Bible are out of context and misapplied. I commend him for his desire to get along with others peacefully but his understanding of Christ, what Christ claimed about himself and other concepts from the Bible are flawed. His version of Buddhism, with a decidedly post modern flair is a far cry from what is practiced around the world, including Tibetan Buddhism."
3,"Stupid movie, hot chics","This movie was ridiculously stupid, but the girls were hot. I didn't buy it for the acting, so you've been warned ;)"
4,fun movie,This is a fun movie about 3 jr. college cheerleaders and their adventures as they try to make money for grad school.
5,Little House on the Prairie Audio-book Delivers!!,"What a delight! Cherry Jones has the perfect voice for the Laura Ingalls Wilder books. This audio book didn't offer a sound clip & I really wanted to hear the narrator before my purchase. I was able to hear her voice on another book with her & was delighted. I purchased this particular book as a companion for my trip to the site of 'the little house on the prairie' in Independence, Kansas. I've read all of Laura's books & Cherry Jones has brought more realism to the stories. I highly recommend the audio book versions of the 'Little House' books."
4,Great,I had to have this book for my collection of Little House books. The colored illustrations are wonderful. The only fault I found was that there are a few errors with spelling and editing.
5,A wonderfully told classic!,"Charming, engaging, and wonderfully told, the story about Laura and her family's life on the frontier is a great read for preteen readers and adults alike. Very interesting, this is a great book for young readers looking for a good book, or even for adults. A great story about a family that sticks together through very tough times as well as a good look into what life a settler was really like."
1,BORING,This book was the worst book I ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had to read this book for school and it's 507 pages of dull.I highly recommend to you not to read this book!
1,zzzzzzz....,"I hated this book when I was little, and having re-read it as an adult, I hate it even more. While it is a children's book, I think that Wilder's painfully simple prose would put any fourth grader to sleep. Reading the unendingly dull chapters about Pa building the house, the door, the fireplace and the well made me want to burn the log cabin down. And I still can't believe that Ma ironed on the wagon in the middle of the prairie. (wtf?) If you want to read a true children's classic I recommend The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Winnie-the-Pooh, The Secret Garden or Charlotte's Web. I only recommend reading Wilder's books to your children when they can't fall asleep."
3,WARNING,"I LOVE the wit and humour of these Canadian copycats, and THAT'S WHY I have been offended by the boldness of the issuing record company, who somehow neglected to dust off the vinyl from which they have copied most of the tracks for this CD. Furthermore, some of their transcriptions here are grossly distorted. I have heard better sounding bootlegs, of which this may well be the one!? In comparison, my Diamonds' original Australian MERCURY singles sound like master-tapes... Try UK import instead! Sometimes it is wiser to spend a bit more than to throw your money away."
5,Ground-breaking approach to working with kids,"Windows to Our Children was written by Violet Oaklander 20 years ago and has become a classic for professionals who work with children, and for parents as well. It is filled with creative approaches to helping kids get in touch with and express their emotions. Dr. Oaklander describes many techniques using play and art therapy, including use of drawings, music, games, puppets, and many other effective avenues to assist children and adolescents in coming to terms with emotional needs, wounds, and challenges. Windows to Our Children is interesting, relevant, and easy to read. It is still used as a required text in many college courses, and should be very helpful to psychotherapists, teachers, parents, and anyone else who spends time with children. Dr. Oaklander is working on a sequel, updating her work with children over the last 20 years."
4,comprehensive but not exhaustive,Plenty of details. However somewhat cumbersome to navigate and not as exhaustive ed.as I expect.
4,Good book,My son enjoys learning about the books and pictures included in historical accounts of civilization. This is picture filled and informative to look at with him.
5,Smell the salt in the air; hear the crashing surf!,"I've been on a 50s rock & roll kick as of late and bought The Best of Santo & Johnny after remembering I loved their tune, ""Sleep Walk."" Well, I just popped it into my CD player and it's a great album! I love the slide guitar or steel guitar and the early ""surf rock"" sound. Who knew these two brothers from Brooklyn could play such mean ""surf rock""? Highly recommended!In browsing Amazon.com, I was disappointed to see that not a one of Santo & Johnny's original LPs is in print on CD! Their music deserves to be heard and I'm glad this CD is around so I can mellow out/swoon to their awesome music!Thanks Stardust records and thanks Amazon.com!"
3,Interesting but...,"I expected a lot from this one and after practicing it a bit, I didn't find it that innovative and usable...No disrespect for the author or Barry Harris, but it didn't make it for me !I think the ideas presented here are good and clever, but not the only way to understand harmony and bebop (hopefully !). You can give it a try and see for yourself."
1,Hmmm,"Pretty expansive and I'm wondering if I can find these resources somewhere else. Comes with a cd with all your needs not sure where the price hike came from. Confused. The only useful thing I been having a hard time finding that available here is a grading system to follow but then again theres no instruction, just the measurements. Hmmmm, once again. Not worth the price."
1,Mis-Leading and doesn't work,"This item is advertised as a replica of the I dream of Jeannie bottle from the series of the same name. It's an inflatible item as stated by the vendor. The problem is it's very difficult to inflate and even when you do (and it takes a long time) it is not a ""replica"" of the I dream of Jeannie Bottle. It's described in a mis-leading matter and after this I found a real replica and it's night and day. This one I deflated but that sure didn't take long.I feel it's also a high price between the tag price and shipping for what it is. It looks like something you'd float in a pool."
5,Probably the best book on the subject I've ever seen,"There are books on the phonology and such of the English language. There are books on the history of the English language. There are books on the English language today, discussing how it varies from place to place. This book has the distinction of covering all, and covering them all very well. The historical linguistics part is particularly good, whth complete and detailed chapters on the stages from Old English to the present day, but going back to Indo-European. But the first chapter of the book, on present-day English phonology, is also very good. And so is the last one, on ""English around the world.""The only point that could be criticized is the price -- extremely high. I got my copy as a used book on Amazon Marketplace. But I doubt that many would really want to pay over $100 for a book, no matter how good."
2,"A sloppy, badly edited book","I read this book to see if I might use it the next time I teach the history of the English language. There are many typos in this edition, beginning with the cover (transformtum is not a Latin word). More surprising, given the content, is how many grammatical errors it contains as well. Also, the book often uses phonetic symbols that are never explained. The chart on the inside cover, because concerned only with present-day English, omits them. I think this book would cause a lot of frustration for students, and it reaffirms my belief that Cengage is a profit-driven press that does not care much about the quality of the texts it produces."
3,Technical and trendy,"Millward has written an interesting explanation of the evolution of English, but her modern, progressive, anti-traditional, anti-prescriptive, pro-change bias often gets in the way. Her first mistake is to describe language as ""conventional"" rather than traditional, as if people create language by committee instead of inheriting it from others and passing on it others. Her second mistake is to describe language as ""arbitrary,"" a rather loose use of the word for someone with little good to say about prescriptive arbiters of language. That's her third mistake: She cannot bring herself to admit that change can be bad and that prescription often serves good purposes, like making it easier to conceive and communicate difficult thoughts, and making it possible for people to communicate with other people from different times and places."
3,good but the price is outrageous,"This is in fact a good book but it has one big problem.The price is way off.I spent 19 dollars for a book with some letters and paintings.Don't get me wrong it does have great dragon species and info and more that will delight any dragon lover but the price should be racked down to around 10 dollars.Believe me if you are a serious dragon fanatic get the dragonology books(dragonology,dragonology handbook and dragonology 2006 calendar).If you are obsessed with dragons though(like me) you might still want to get this book.But i doubt it will be one of your favorites."
2,Godzilla meets scooby doo,"This movie could have been great if it had a bigger budget. I did think Gigan was a cool newcomer to the franchise. The reason I don't like it is because of the stock footage, Japanese Scooby doo gang complete with a shaggy utilizing a corn on the cob weapon and the monsters suits, sans Gigan, being old and worn out. They used the Godzilla cookie monster suit for this one. Yes the monsters have anthropomorphic traits such as talking and teasing each other. Only get this if you want to complete a collection. Too bad because with a bigger budget this could have been a great movie."
4,great monster movie,This is a great monster movie. One of the best godzilla movies. I think king ghidorah and gigan make a great partnership when they fight godzilla anguirus.
1,The monsters talk,"The monsters talk in this movie. the title as originally Godzilla On Monster Island in Japan. The monster, Gigan is cool.He is from space. You will not like King Gidrath in this ONE. King Gidrath looks messed up. The siute does. It is a good movie for those who like to watch Godzilla and other monster movies."
1,Absolute tat,"Who chooses which Godzilla films are to be released in the UK? Pop Larkin? We're still awaiting the release of the Destroyah, Biollante, nineties Mechagodzilla and original 1950s Godzilla films over here, and yet twaddle like this waste of time is festering wherever you may go.The plot (if you feel like calling it that) involves a race of aliens who intend to take over the world with the help of a monster which appears to have been put together from kitchen utensils. So it's up to Godzilla and that rather hopeless Ankylosaurus-bloke to sort out the mess, mumbling and muttering to one another in synthesized tones as they go about it.Yawnsome, predictable, laughable trash."
5,big wrench,"I have not had any promblems with this. THIS THING IS AWESOME. Took out the most annoying bolts that i just couldnt get even with a breaker bar. As i read in the other reviews about the trigger, yes its not the greatest but man does this thing work like a charm."
4,descent tool,"descent tool, needs a little more torque and a brake to stop impact wrench from continuously spinning."
4,Best bang for your buck,"All in all I am VERY happy with my purchase. I was a stubborn Palm IIIc user until I bought this unit. I ahd the Ipaq but did not want to deal with the manufacturing issues. This unit is solid, performs aptly (I recommend GoBar to assist in memory usage), and I bought the hard lid that the 548 sports. One drawback is the lack of USB support. If you need that, you must look elsewhere. I cannot give it 5 stars because it does not have an active matrix screen and only sports 16 MB of ram, but I would recommend this to anyone who want to try the Pocket PC platform but does not want to shell out $500; or anyone who wants a good PDA while they wait for the next hottest thing to come out."
3,Not for a Pocket Gamer,"This Pocket PC is very good for the basics..reading eBooks, offline webpages, notes, e-mail, appointments. However, if you are a Pocket Gamer like I am there is nearly no good games out there. I got Doom to work, but the graphics are hideous. Anyway, if you are using this organizer as, well, an organizer, then it's a good deal for a good price. But if you want to use this pocket pc as a, hahaha, pocket PC, you should invest in 600 or 700 series HP products."
2,POOR COMMUNICATION,"I WROTE A SCATHING REVIEW BECAUSE I DID NOT RECIEVE MY PRODUCT & RECIEVED NO COMMUNICATION. THIS MORNING I RECIEVED A CALL FROM ""MICHELL"" FROM THE COMPANY THAT SELLS THE PRODUCT. SHE SAID THAT THEY HAD SENT ME 3 E-MAILS. I DID NOT RECIEVE THE E-MAILS & TRIED TO TELL HER SO, BUT SHE JUST KEPT INSISTING THAT THEY HAD E-MAILED ME. TO THE POINT THAT I FELT THAT SHE WAS CALLING ME A LIAR.SHE THEN SAID THAT IF I WOULD WRITE A MORE FAVORABLE REVIEW THEY WOULD REFUND MY MONEY. THAT SOUNDS LIKE BLACK MAIL TO ME.I WILL GIVE THEM THE BENFIT OF THE DOUBT, THAT THEY MAY HAVE INDEED ATTEMPTED TO E-MAIL ME. I DID NOT GET THEM!!!!!!!!!I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD REFUND MY MONEY WEATHER I WRITE THEM A GOOD REVIEW OR NOT."
3,40 Ways to Raise a Nonracist Child,"My comment is for the authors.I object to the cover of the book. One of the things that I find disheartening in media is the constant elimination of African-American girls. Their young counterparts are repeatedly included yet there is no one who reperesents them. This adds to the perception that other races have of them. As you present information to the public, consider what your message is to these girls. Please do not attempt to remedy this by picturing a bi-racial child. Such photos do not help.Thank You, RM (A teacher and mom)"
5,Never listen more better,"Thia album - is best? that i ever listen! All songs are beautiful !! But my favotites is ""Thalhiem"", ""Wonderlust"" and ""Midnight Sun"". My UIN 11413676 - glad to talk witn you !"
1,some might like it...,"I saw this movie in literature class a few months ago. We were reading some of Wilde's work and I guess our teacher wanted to give us some info about his life. Anyway, this is NOT the kind of film you should show 15 year old students... The acting is good but I think the movie should focus more on his work. Some people might like it but I (and the rest of my class) didn't enjoy it."
1,Excessive focus homosexuality for shock value too corny,"After reading the many glowing reviews on Amazon, I ordered this DVD immediately. Unfortunately, its excessive and gratuitous focus on Wilde's homosexuality was a profound disappointment. Nudge, nudge. Know what I mean? Nudge, nudge. This production provides little context for the scope of Wilde's life, accomplishments, and brilliant wit.Serious Wilde fans would do better to watch Peter Egan's enthralling portrayal in BBC's exceptional series ""Lillie"", about the life of Lillie Langtry. Wilde plays a prominent role throughout this production. Peter Egan portrays Wilde's flamboyant cutting wit with brilliance that will spoil you.May I also suggest Richard Ellmann's mammoth 600-page Wilde biography? When you encounter some of the book's tedious passages you can always make rude sucking noises as you read if you wish.This is my first review and was inspired by anger.www.johncregar.com"
3,subject,They should have gotten Gene Wilder to play Oscar Wilde. It would have made this movie a lot Wilder.
3,JUDE AND STEPHEN DELIVER STAR PERFORMANCES,"This is a superficial account on the life of the most famous homosexual ever, the master of poetry, Oscar Wilde.Instead of tragic intensity we are given a watered out love story which wouldn`t be so had the writer Julian Mitchell and director Brian Gilbert stressed the subject and moved 2 fast.Stephen lacks Oscar`s cynisism, but with Jude Law quite good without being brilliant..."
3,"Good info, unexpected format","Having purchased Not By Faith Alone I was expecting a detailed in-depth analysis of the sola scriptura subjuct. What you get with this book is a collection of essays and debates on the topic. While the book is an interesting read, I would have preferred a format more like the aforementioned book."
3,pretty good--most of it,"This book intrigued me and bored me.The vignettes Whiting spins were entertaining to read. He writes with an understated style thats suits each episode perfectly. In these instances, the people involved are not mere names, but people in action.In the space between these stories, Whiting lost me. He endlessly lists names, places, and events in passing, that, while it may be important to someone interested in straight facts, didn't appeal to me. I was glad to get to the end.But I have to say that after reading this book, I have a much better understanding of that side of Japanese history. Especially enlightening was the wounded nationalism displayed by the Japanese. They wanted to be the best in the world--at first militarily, then, after being defeated, the focus changed to business--to top the US (and the rest of the world) in something. All in all, a good book. Just get past the filler."
4,Progressive Rock Is Here To Stay,"I was cruisin' Amazon looking for some YES albums when I came across a recommendation for Spock's Beard. Being a baby boomer fan of YES, ASIA, King Crimson, and Genesis I lament most of the new bands out there. Green Day and Nirvana never really did it for me. The Kindness of Strangers is my first Spock's Beard CD purchase. This is a great album and very reminiscent of YES during the Bruford Period with a tinge of Genesis (before Phil Collins thought himself a crooner.) I highly recommend the following cuts ""The Good Don't Last,"" ""Strange World,"" and ""Harm's Way."" The Kindness of Strangers is a good introduction to Spock's Beard."
3,Toto looks a little strange,"I purchased this for a child as an accessory to a Wizard of Oz dress-up trunk. Although it's more a costume accessory than a toy, it's pretty sturdy. The ""basket"" is made of plastic and is a nice size for little girls (I purchased it for a four-year-old). The only problem is the weird expression on Toto's face. His mouth is wide open, revealing goofy jagged teeth (think: felt cut by pinking sheers) and a big pink tongue just stuck there in the middle. It would have been better to include a little dog with a closed mouth. This expression makes Toto look sort of demented. Even my niece asked why his mouth was open in that weird way and she didn't play with it nearly as much as she did the rest of the Oz accessories."
2,Two stars for effort.,I wasn't impressed with this album! All of my friends enjoyed it so I borrowed it form my friend and it wasn't at all what they said!I'm not the rap type anyways!
2,"Editor, Editor...!","Unfortunately while this book does try to explore a fascinating and worthwhile subject, it suffers the same predicament that most non-fiction books for the past three decades have fallen under - incompetent editing. The author repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats her ideas and observations. Perhaps she was trying to meet a minimum word limit ordained by her publisher but that consideration shouldn't elicit anyone's sympathy. The constant re-iteration of points (and the author's desert-dry ""voice"" that exacerbates the repetition with its monotonous tone) makes for such a frustrating reading experience that I could not go past the second chapter."
5,Genesis,"Kurzman has written a historical treasure filled with details and personal experiences of the first Arab/Israeli war. Anyone who has an interest in the Middle East would be well advised to read it, reread it, and reread it again."
4,Great Dance CD,"The John Skinner Band's Second Complete Ballroom Dance offers a variety of music suitable for experienced as well as new students of ballroom dance. This is their second recording of ballroom music. As with their first recording, the tempo and length of the selections are geared specifically for dancing. This is what makes it an excellent choice for finding just the right song for practice. This recording offers several swing numbers which are currently popular. The assortment provides enough variety to keep dancing without having to change cds. The two cds combined will provide an evening of music for a practice or party. If you can't have the pleasure of dancing to the Skinner Band in person, then this is the next best thing."
3,Limited Use Because It Doesn't Turn,"I know this toy has rave reviews - that's why I bought it. But, it just was not as awesome as I would have hoped. It is super cute. And, I was thrilled when she first pushed it around a little bit (this made a great and exciting video when she was about 8-9 months old). But, for any kid that is an early walker and a very coordinated walker...it is a very frustrating toy because the wheels do not turn. So, she can push it in a straight line until she hits something....and thats it....she cannot turn or maneuver it in any way. So, I feel that this wagon is pretty useless past the age that the child is walking really well - and for some kids thats pretty quick. I know she could probably put some toys in it and pull/push it around or whatever, but she would enjoy that more if the wheels turned. She has pretty much abandoned the wagon except for the random idea to try to stand in it or use it to climb up to something higher."
3,"Fun, but also frustrating","We bought this toy because of rave reviews and so I wanted to weigh in with a slight negative. It is fun for the baby but can be very frustrating, too. It's been a little bit hard for him to maneuver, especially on carpet. Most of the time he'd rather have us push him around in it than push it himself, which can be hard on mommy's lower back after a while! Because it often leads to frustration, we end up keeping it out of sight most of the time and just bringing it out once in a while. Also, if you don't have good open space (where you're not negotiating around the couch or up and down a narrow patio, for example), turning it can be a little tough. This is definitely a toy that requires hands-on help from parents at least until kids are 18 months or older."
4,Classic wagon,"Got this for my son's first birthday. He didn't care for it as much as we thought he would. He does like taking the sides out, climbing in, and riding or pushing a buddy in the wagon. We don't have a lot of space to push the thing around so it's annoying that it doesn't turn easily. It's sturdy and such a classic, thouugh, we like it overall."
5,"Excellent wagon, quality product","My friend loaned me her son's walker wagon for my son -he loved it so much I bought my little guy his own. This wagon is sturdy, well-made, and practical. My favorite feature are the clicking rubber wheels with resistance built into them. This helps my son (and his wagon) to not fall over (as he has with other wagons) and also allows the wagon to work well on both wood floors and carpeting. The wheels only go straight, which is also good for babies learning how to walk. Other nice features are the bumper on the front of the wagon (saves the furniture) and the removable wood wagon walls. I highly recommend investing in this wagon for your baby -dont waste your money on cheap plastic bright colored walkers -in my opinion, this one is the safest and most durable one out there."
5,Walking with the FLYER...,This wagon is a great find...our Granddaughter is walking behind it sooner than we expected !!! Speeds the process of walking after crawling!
5,10 month old daughter loves it,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old because she had been standing up and attempting to cruise since she was 8 months old. She was mostly interested in putting toys in to the wagon and pulling them out again until she turned 10 months. Now she loves to walk with it. She quickly figured out not to lean into it too hard so that it wouldn't go too fast. She is so proud of herself as she walks up and down the living room.I agree with other reviewers, it is hard to turn. But if it was easy to turn, it may be too much for new walkers.Over all, its great, my daughter loves it =)"
5,LOVE IT!,My Son absolutely loves his wagon.The wagon is very sturdy not to mention cute. It is perfect to help your baby learn how to walk.
3,Buyer beware of the wagon version with cheap plastic wheels,"I got this product [...] from Amazon.com[...]. One of the wood pieces was cracked which my husband called in and got a very prompt replacement from Radio Flyer. However the wheels we got are hollow, plastic and cheap. They are not the wheels in the picture. The wheels in the picture are solid, heavy and have a grippy-texture to them which is touted as one of the features of this wagon. I know this from comparing one in a store. This makes me mad to be getting an inferior product. I thought I was getting a deal but now understand why the price was so cheap. I would rather pay a couple bucks more for the quality version and am very upset that different versions exist."
2,Assembly is a Nightmare!,"This product is nice enough but it is unnecessarily complicated to assemble. It must have taken my husband an hour and when I came by to check on him he was surrounded by hundreds of parts -- bolts, screws etc. etc. Spending an hour assembling a wagon is not what a working parent wants to do at the end of the day! Otherwise wagon seems fine, although to be clear we just got it."
5,Great Walker!,Our son LOVES this walker. It is very well built and sturdy. As you push it there is a clicking sound and enough resistance so the walker doesn't go too quickly causing a fall. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
4,funny colors,"My granddaughter loves spongebob. She said some of the characters were the wrong color, such as green instead of yellow. She loves the color blast though. The markers dry up fast, so I had to order a few sets just to have enough markers."
3,Great for kids 10 and under,"This reminded me of some kind of ABC After School Special. That's all I expected, so I wasn't disappointed. It's just a good little movie about some kids racing to save the family farm and motocross track. Lorenzo Lamas is servicable, as is Grizzly Adams. The kids are cute. The monkey angle is funny and I bet your kids will laugh. The younger they are the better.This will make them want to either go outside and ride their bmx bikes or their dirt bikes or atvs. And get a pet monkey."
5,A region-by-region profile to over 280 wine companies,"Here's a region-by-region profile to over 280 wine companies accompanying in-depth profiles of 10 selected New Zealand winemakers and packed with maps and new photos. Analysis of climate, soils and wine styles accompany an illustrated history of the wine industry and a regional organization just perfect for the destination-oriented New Zealand wine fan. But you don't have to be traveling there to appreciate the extensive geography and wine grape facts packed into Michael Cooper's Wine Altas Of New Zealand: with John McDermott's color photos gracing nearly every page, armchair wine fans have a lot to enjoy, too."
4,Price raise,They were really good for the old price of $9.99. I was going to order more but with a 50% increase in price not sure they are worth it. Going to look for some alternatives.
2,Wrong product,This CD has a different track listing to the one mentioned in Amazon therefore it is not the CD requested and not the CD that really wanted.
1,PHULEESE!,"THIS ALBUM STINKS! ARE U PPL TOO OBSESSED TO REALISE THAT THE DOLLS ARE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS AND CANT SING, THEY ARENT EVEN REAL! YOU ARENT BUYING THE BRAT'Z SINGING, BUT SOME FREAK SINGING FOR PLASTIC PPL."
5,This CD Totally Rocks!,"This CD totally rocks! The songs are amazing and have a great rock beat. I was hesitant about ""Se Siente"" at first, but now I really love that song. I love the whole CD. I would totally recommend this CD to any Bratz fan or any fan of great songs with great beats to match."
4,"It's one of the best british fusionworks,close to prog music","Here is Gary Moore at his peak of career, expecially when He can perform a mini-suite like ""STAR MAIDEN/MYSTERIOSO/QUASAR"" by playing both acoustic and electric guitars, with a great skill, a certain creativity and originality as well. But also when He performs such a typical fusion, rock standard, He shows an aggressive and influential impact on the british guitarists, without forgetting the influence of the early Colosseum works, completely diverse!! A great fusion prog intro at the keyboards by Don Airey in the excellent title track, another memorable track(""Inquisition"") and other fine stuff as well!!Recommended also to the fans of fusion prog..."
2,Stiffed By Stiffs!,"Normally I love all movies with Danny Aiello in them--he's such a talented actor in comedies as well as dramas. This movie with the theme of a divorced dad, former businessman, now hearse driver seemed like it would have some potential but it was really lacking. All of the elderly Italians of this particular New Jersey neighborhood have died off and business at the funeral home is falling off. However, there is a plan that involves getting rid of some people that the partners don't really like, but who's to know? This is where the film gets confusing for me because there is a history of the gambler, addict, friend who is trying to find out about his father. Then there is Aiello's character who is trying to have a relationship with his son. It's never clear to me who all the bad guys are and how they all know each other, but there's some major offing going on and it's not a pretty sight! Too many wakes, wailing, and whacking for me!"
1,almost forgetable,"I don't remember anything about this movie except that I stayed up late one night to watch it on TV and felt absolutely cheated. I had heard that the movie was good so I thought, ""well, it's on, let's give it a try."" But I seriously can't remember anything about it except that I thought it was terrible. I almost want to watch it again just to see why it left such a bad taste in my mouth, except that, you know, I'm going to have to taste it again. Hmm, maybe. I can always turn it off when it starts to get painful."
4,Definitely a good one!,"I have pretty much all of Hugh Grant's movies, so this one is another one in my collection. It is not my absolute favorite, considering all his others and Love Actually being my all time favorite movie ever I think! But this is definitely worth watching and owning if you like Hugh Grant. It's mostly a story of a group of friends and events in their life with a subtle focus on Charles (Hugh Grant) and Carrie (Andie MacDowel), who seem to keep meeting each other at these seemingly unrelated events, but also seem to be falling for each other. But there is a little twist in there that I'm not going to give away here. You must watch it! It is definitely a charming British film!"
5,Just do(buy) it!,A video you want to watch from time to time. It can still crack you up every time you watch it. Classic British way of humor. It is certainly a must for your video collection.
4,Stuttering Luminescence,"I had teen girls in my house during the 90's and they loved this one. Hugh Grant's best role this side of an LA alley, I hate it when I'm snide like that. Anyhow, Grant fears he will never find the one, the lightning bolt one. Each wedding, his entourage of single friends, old school chums and a vagrant mop head dutifully attend, always late, always a little worse for wear. Every funny disaster at these loaded affairs are reviewed, Grant stutters through the pratfalls. He continues this technique through Notting Hill and Love Actually. The man is now very rich.Yes, Andie McDowell literally glows like a cosmetics company ad. Never met anyone quite as luminescent at any wedding except, er my lovely wife."
5,One of the best romantic comedies ever!,"A bunch of British friends, who are outwardly proud of being single, but inwardly are looking for their perfect match are attending a wedding almost every weekend - including shy Charlie who falls in love with an impossible American woman, his redheaded flat mate named Scarlett, and a mutual friend who secretly loves Charlie.The only thing wrong with this delightful DVD set is the lack of any special feature whatsoever."
5,Romantic light comedy,"The real life locations in which this film is set are outstanding from start to finish, a veritable travelogue of ""secret"" Great Britain. Many moments work well, especially when the characters begin to show their personalities. Hugh Grant is good (cast as a character that resembles himself) in this film and Andie McDowell was never lovelier. We wish she would appear in more first rate films. The supporting cast is really an ensemble cast and they all do their work very well. The cameo of Rowan Atkinson the bumbling vicar is so good. Father Son and Holy Goat indeed! Holy Spigot, too. What fun. The tender eulogy by John Hannah is one of two of the best eulogies in all of cinema history, the other being in ""Waking Ned Divine"". The scene in the rain is also lovely. This movie wears well upon re-watching."
4,The best I've found so far,"I've eaten things that taste like sawdust and sugar as well as sickenly sweet ""health food bars"" of questionable merit. This is a good product that I feel safe in using when my blood sugar is low, knowing that it really was created for diabetics who want good control. It tastes fine, even for someone who doesn't care much for candy bar type foods. To my tastes, this is far better tasting than the oatmeal raisin flavor. I like that Glucerna comes in two sizes so I eat only what I really need rather than indulge in extra calories."
2,5 stars for the movie; 2 for the vhs: Where's the DVD?,"'The Cat People' is a wonderfully creepy and atmospheric film. Fans of 'The Sixth Sense' will love this suggestive, eerie classic of horror. This film just begs for a crisp DVD image and re-release with several extras included. With a recent book on Jacques Turner on the market how come this hasn't been released on the shiny disc format?"
2,"Same old story, same old song and dance...","For an intro to Aerosmith, this is a good book, although the author tells the story with magazine interviews and redundancy. Most people probably already know this info, and he tells it with little creativity. I liked the pictures, though. If you're a hardcore fan and want to get down to the real nitty-gritty, read Walk This Way - it is AWESOME!!"
4,Zoe Rocks!,"Things really heat up this season . Jackie is pushing the limits of deceitfulness and addiction, Zoe has lost weight and is getting some attention from males other than Lenny. If nurse Jackie didn't have lots of compassion for her patients, she would be a most unlikeable character."
4,Just good,"This show used to be AMAZING. I loved it! But now it is just good. It lacks that edge that it used to have. I don't know, it was just a little boring this season."
5,very insightful and detailed.,"I am doing my thesis on DSP based control of DC-DC Buck converter and I have looked into many different kinds of books. Many power electronic books are either very general/basic theory (best of such kind of books is by Hart) or too practical for someone with academic intentions. On the other hand the book by Philip Krein in full of insights and useful details that are not talked about in any other power electronics books that I have looked into. For example, frequency domain control for DC-DC converters is very clear, percise, and full of insights, it was very useful for me."
2,Very disappointed,"I thought I had done all the research. Seemed like a fantastic product. It was - for about 2 years. Then it started making the awful growling sound like something is stuck - only there wasn't anything there, and I hadn't vacuumed anything up that I knew of. Can't find a place that repairs Dysons anywhere in the city. No longer under warranty. Beaucoup dollars down the drain. Dyson's web site is no help whatsoever. They say most problems can be fixed over the phone. Yeah, right. Didn't work."
2,Check Consumer's Report First!,"I bought the Dyson thinking and believing the other reviews, but yikes! I won't do that again! It did have fairly good suction, I have to admit. But not good enough. Also, trying to use the attachments was SO time consuming! You have to undo the whole tubing section, then turn it upside down and plug it all back in again - very inefficient! I did like that you could stretch it all the way up/down stairs, but that didn't change my overall opinion of the machine. I read Consumer's Report and bought their advised Eureka and I love it!"
1,Suggested retail is WAY off targe,"The retail on this is NOT $500.00. I found brand new ones for $359 at http://www.best-vacuum.com/dyson-DCO7steelyellow.htmlwith no sales tax!!!!! Not worth messing with a refurb. I've tried one of these at a friends, new, and after a month and it dealing with some fine dust from a little drywall sanding, you can hear a horrbile whining noise.. The hose is VERY bad design. It pulls REALLY hard and is difficult to use almost always pulling the vaccum over."
5,Help my wife won't stop vacuuming...,"My wife saw this unit and had to have it. I searched the entire internet till I found factory reconditioned units on Amazon.com. I must say we where a bit leary about purchasing a reconditioned unit at first. We decided for the price it was the best deal around so we took a chance. This unit is amazing. My wife vacuumed for 4 hours straight. It came out of the box looking brand new. All manuals included. It's quiet, and the suction is amazing from start to finish. We live in the desert and fine silica dust is an extreme hazard here. We pulled 3 full bins of dirt from our high traffic living room. We highly recommend getting this unit (factory reconditioned or not). You'll be amazed at what you are missing with your other vacuum!!!"
5,Reconditioned is a Wise Decison,"I don't think I need to brag this up anymore than everyone else. The first time you vaccumn with this sweet thing, you'll vaccumn every day for the next week. After the honeymoon, you'll settle down with it and find it is durable, superb filter cleaning, and all of its parts are assembled with the idea of them being able to be dissassembled. I like it, every time I see a vaccumn I feel the need to bring up the subject of mine, you won't regret it, it's a purchse you should be confident in making."
5,Best Vacuum I've ever seen.,"On Monday, I Steam cleaned the carpet with our hover steam cleaner. On Tuesday our reconditioned Dyson arrived in almost new condition, there are a few scuff marks on it. We vacuumed the carpet and got a full canister of dog and cat hair along with some very fine dirt.I am sold, this thing is just flat impressive. Another nice surprise was that it is not very noisy compared to some other vacuums we have had. I have called Dyson and ordered the turbo brush to go with our Yellow Dyson. I think that would be helpful on furniture. Bottom line, good price when compared to the new ones. Reconditioned one is in like new condition, and it picks up stuff you would not believe. My friend has a Bissell turbo type vac. and not only does he have to empty the dirt bin he also has to clean the filters out. This Dyson picks up dirt his machine left behind, and it was all in the bin, the filter looks new.I would not hesitate to recommend this machine to my friends!"
5,dyson referbished,"came clean, in packaging. Needed slight assembly. Worked very well. Changed the color of my carpet! Hard to clean stairs though."
1,A bootleg,Why is this album on amazon.com? It's a bootleg of Joni James recordings unauthorized by her; she owns her own masters and all this music is legitimately is available and easily obtainable.
2,Buyer Beware - not standard Digital Copy,"Very good movie, liked it in the theater. I wanted to post this right away, though. Buyer Beware, digital copy works only on PS3 to download to PSP. I'm very disappointed. This is in fine print on the back of the case. Deceptive on Sony's part. Really reduces value of Blu ray in my book."
5,Charming.,"Clever humor, insigtful social commentary, and the love story make this a movie that can be enjoyed by all. My particularly favorite part is when the coffee break is included in the end of the world preventative measures. It shows that it is important to take a break even when we are engaged in important work. I also like the scene where the girl watches a cat dancing for 3 hours. Funny. Enjoy!"
1,Boring. Actually fell asleep ....zzzzzzzzzzz,"I noticed all the bad reviews were about this being a digital problem. My complaint is content. On the outset it looked like a fun movie. A lot of animated films these days are done with parent and child in mind. It was just us adults watching and one of us fell asleep. The other one (me) stayed awake because ... well, I'm the one who bought it so I wanted it to be good. It sounded like a really fun story line but the story was all jumbled and it didn't tell the story in a way that was very interesting or funny. If I could have fallen asleep I would of but someone had to turn off the telly."
3,SAD LITTLE MOVIE,"I was looking for a feel good, funny movie. Instead, I got a sad parable - never give up your dream. While there is that lesson, I can't think what market they were aiming for. The age group that would appreciate it would be the Dora the explorer group, the little ones who love lots of fast moving colors, lots of things exploding and fast action witn no one getting hurt so they won/t be traumatized. The story is certainly geared to adults as the undertones would be lost on a child. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Excellent for kids and adults alike,This animation mixed excellent humor with a great story in order to create a dynamic movie! I was laughing out loud along with the kids. Usually children's films are cheesy and predictable with a common plot. This story takes unexpected twists and turns while providing so much humor that you'll regret having had that entire jumbo soda at the beginning of the film!
2,"Movie's great, but Sony's Digital Copy is B.S.. .","Nothing against the movie, it's great and funny. My beef is with Sony's Digital Copy. It's not mentioned anywhere (except from other review) that the digital copy requires Sony's PSP format. In fact, this is ONLY mentioned in 6 point fine print on the back of the label. So if you're like me that don't have a PSP and was expecting to watch this on iTunes (really, was expecting to transfer this to my iPad so my kids can watch it) or Window Media, forget it!"
4,Entertaining!,I didn't think I would enjoy a anime with such a odd concept. I highly doubted that it will add up to anything. But whole thing works. Characters introduced are odd. Almost all the characters are odd. The writer must have had quite a loner life when he was growing up. But all comes together. Storyline with all its oddity comes together to give you a satisfying experience. Very enjoyable movie for the whole family.
1,Deceptive packaging,Digital copy is not the digital copy we all know and love. Cannot use it if you don't have a PS3 or a or the handheld playstation. I hope Sony gets sued over this.
5,My favorite animated film,I absolutely love this movie. Glad it came with two discs. It means I could have one and give one to a friend essentially. This movie's sense of humor is sensationally modern and I absolutely adore it. So clever and well put together. I can understand a lot of parents not getting because it's sort of a newer humor (30 and under generations sort of relish it). Anyways... I watch this movie all the time and never get tired of it. You see something new you missed in the background or a reference they made each time you watch it.
2,DIGITAL COPY SUCKS!,"1. digital copy was not included, missing.2. and if it was included, the redemption code was expired. TWO YEARS AGO!3. Digital copy only works on psp."
4,Product works.,"The product worked but I would highly suggest pulling though a small amount of hair and not through every hole that has a circle around it. I should have gone with just the front and top section instead of whole head. Although the color came out great I'd leave it to a professional next time. It literally took 2 hours to get my hair through all of the tiny holes and I definitely needed help from my husband. If I had done it all on my own I would have been so dizzy trying to see in a mirror to do the back part of my head. If you're going to use this product, or any self-highlighting product, I'd suggest doing a small amount at a time to see if you like it."
3,Not their best,"Find State of the Union, if you want their best stuff. This one is not bad, but does have some filler......"
1,boring,"I didn't feel like I was playing a game. It seemed very random and very dull. I wanted to like it. I like most of the tycoon games and I love coffee. But, this game doesn't do it. I can't really even call it a game. It is boring."
1,If you want hearing loss at the gun range,Not for the gun range. I had to add standard range ear protection over these ear plugs. The only benefit to these plugs are the ease of placement and removal.
1,Product not as advertised!!,"This product is pictured with one set of ear plugs and a round plastic case. At the end of the description it says that it is a three pack. So I figure three sets of ear plugs and three cases. Nope,three sets of ear plugs with no plastic cases at all, just one cheap little cloth bag that isn't good for storing ear plugs at all. If this is what was pictured I never would have ordered these. Now to use them I need a plastic case, since a cloth bag will not keep the ear plugs clean, it is hard to clean out like a plastic container."
1,Did NOT block any sound,"I put these in my ears and adjusted them many times. I walked into the indoor gun range and it felt like I wore nothing. They did not block any sound. I jammed them in as far as possible and nothing. I had a lady friend try them and they didn't work for her. It seems like they need to be a perfect fit, like a shoe. I'm sure these work for some, but not for me. If you buy them, just make sure you know they will fit."
3,Like the Negative Heal but Very Narrow,"I added walking to my fitness regime as a break for my knees so I thought these would be perfect. I love the look and the negative heel did seem to help posture; however, I couldn't keep them on more than 10 minutes around the house because they were so tight across the ball of the foot. Too bad, but these must go back."
4,A great period piece,This album had a great influence on me as a late teenager and Zappa fan. It's funky andtight and the lyrics are political on several tracks. You can hear the Zappa influence.There's a great song about nature and about native Americans and the brash attitude of thewhite man. A great period piece and it's too bad there weren't more known releases fromthis group.
5,"Exile and creativity:Signposts ,Travelers,Outsiders,Backward Glances by Susan Suleiman",I am a Hungarian born Australian and was intrigued by this title. This edited collection by Susan - also Hungarian born touches a sensitive spot in my life . A great volume for all those researchers whose work deals with cultural issues.Well done Amazon
3,Be cautious before ordering,"This CD is largely a collection of choral and orchestral selections. There are relatively few of the famous arias from this opera. If this is what you want, the music is enjoyable and the performances are quite good for the most part. In one selection, the solo portion of a chorus is barely audible."
2,Nice story but not well done,I did not like the movie really.It is filled with many feelings and impressions and is many sided but I think it is not so close to the reality although it tried to show the truth.The movie was a bit too religious and Matthew Poncelet's part was not well presented by Sean Penn. He acted more like an actor and not like a guilty man who denies having comitted the murder.To put it in a nutshell I would say that the story and the idea is great but it is not very well done.I would recommend this movie to others because it shows the different angles and views of the people very well although I did not like the movie.--A student's opinion from Germany--
3,Opinion on Dead Man Walking,"I really enjoyed ""Dead Man Walking"" because it shows the murderers point of view as well as the victims` families` sides.It gives a good impression about the suffering of everyone who is concerned in cases of the death penalty.In the end of the film the stress is too much on the emotional base and serious arguments for or against Matt`s execution are left out.But all in all I could imagine that this film really could change people&#180;s minds about Capital Punishment."
3,Different ...,This is a book written by somebody who knows the ins and outs of performance management. It does not have a lot of fluff and management jargon but gives the reader some real-world practically applicable information
2,rubber band is a problem,"I like the reed case, but I have ruined several reeds already by trying to get the tip of the reed under the rubber band. If I am very careful I can get the reed in with no problem. I have a similar (not vito) reed case for my Bb Clarinet and the reed tip slips under a plastic 'clamp'. I have never ruined a reed with that case. I would not buy another vito reed case."
4,Forward to Freedom: From Exodus to Easter [,"This is worthwhile reading for my community's lenten reflection. There is some element of it being more individualistic than community oriented, but our study of Exodus coincided with Lent this year, so it is consistent with our study."
3,Only for the die hards,"This compilation is filled with underproduced tracks that Bruce recorded not only before he was famous, but even before he actually had released any material at all.While not necessarily awful, the quality of the recordings don't stack up to other Springsteen CDs (obviously).If you're a casual fan, and don't really know any of Bruce's history, you're better off staying away from this CD.On the other hand, if you are indeed into the Boss, you might want to check this record out. Mostly a 'scientific curiosity', but nonetheless interesting....only for the die hards..."
3,Rare early Bruce songs.Buy it before the lawyers find out!,"This is a nice collection of Springsteen songs circa 1973. Unless you're a fan of Bruce's early acoustic, lyric-heavy songs, this collection will not hold much appeal for you.This set puts the songs of a very young Springsteen out for review, and you can see that early on Bruce was different than the rest of his contemporaries.If you are interested in this title, you may want to purchase it NOW, as this is likely a grey market release, as it has no afffiliation woith CBS/Sony, which holds the copytright for Springsteen's recorded catalog."
4,Missing Five Songs!,"This anthology contains 6 of the 11 songs from the album ""Synapse Gap,"" released in 1982, and all 12 songs from the album, ""Party Weekend,"" released in 1983. Both releases were on MCA. 18 songs from these two albums is a good thing; all 23 would have been better. Well, 22 of them anyway; ""Person-Person"" is no loss. The album is indeed a anthology, but I still feel shorted by the omissions from ""Synapse Gap."""
1,A little too confusing.,"This book was okay, but a little confusing. The book caught my attention in the beginning by the author's explanation of her own relationship with her stepmother. The author used a number of stepmothers and stepdaughters for examples; however, she did not organize her story subjects as well as she could have. There were so many stories and names given, that eventually I couldn't distinguish who was who and who did what in their personal sagas. I gave the author the benefit of the doubt and finished the book, but I did not learn much from it. I would like to remind you that the author's motivation to write the book was partially based on the fact that her own stepmother is an author and encouraged her to write it. My recommendation to the author is: don't quit your day job."
5,ALWAYS A GOOD CHOICE,"have owned Seiko watches for many years, they were excellent watches, this one is the same.Very handsome with black face. Keeps excellent time.As always buying is easy at Amazon and shipping and handling is above other other web based stores."
2,"Great watch, fatal weakness","I like everything about this watch ( thin, lightweight, easy to read ) but the knob catches on many items of clothing. This often pulls the knob out, which stops the watch, unbeknownst to its wearer. The result is you can't trust it to tell the time, which is a bad thing for a wristwatch. I have had it about 6 months, probably found that it had stopped 20 times or so. A few times I was aware of it, usually not. It has always been just the knob getting pulled out, presumably by clothing ( because I've seen it happen )."
4,seiko titanium SGG711watch review,"I bought my Seiko Titanium watch 2 months ago, this is my 2nd Titanium watch since I gave my first one to my son where he wanted a watch that is not that heavy; well this one fits the bill. On the plus side, the watch is lightweight & elegance which is why I would buy it the 2nd time. On the other hand, the titanium surface probably is not as scratch resistance compared to other metal, but it was a minor minor issue though and I am happy with the watch."
1,High price for a cheap looking watch,I have ordered this watch for my friend and when he received it he was disappointed for the following reasons:1. Too small for men. Good for children only.2. The weight was very light as if it is nothing.3. Generally looks very cheep.4. The price is very high for this watch.5. The lock is also bad.The design is the only thing I liked.
4,An Amazingly Awkward Movie!!!,"I just watched this for the 1st time, and it was surprisingly good. I actually enjoyed it. I know it's supposed to be a thriller/drama, because it had some brutal scenes, but I couldn't help but laugh at a few scenes because of their accents and overuse of the line 'oh yeah' There were some pretty random scenes, but that's what makes it a good movie. I loved Frances McDormand's performance as Marge Olmstead. She was my favorite character. Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud was very creepy. Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota and hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, due to financial problems. When things go wrong, people turn up dead, and pregnant Chief Marge Olmstead is on the case. I would definitely recommend FARGO!!!"
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!,I watched it once and I will never watch it again. It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It is incredibly boring and the accents. They just drive me nuts because they do such a lousy job with the accents. Overall this movie sucks and don't waste your money on it.
4,Thanks a bunch ... but disappointing DVD,"FARGO is the best film of 1996! A tragic story set around a tiny town. Best labelled a 'dark comedy', FARGO will keep you on the edge of your seat with it's funny but sad overtones. Frances McDormad is outstanding as the town cop with the funniest accent.DVD EVALUATION: Fargo is definitely worth owning, but its release on DVD leaves much to be desired. AFter making us wait for some time for it, it comes with very little. The print is rather patchy in parts. If you can overlook these issues, then order the DVD because FARGO is very much worth owning."
4,"A masterpiece, but undeniably violent!","There is magic in this film. The music is magical. The filming is magical. The casting is magical. The actors are magical. The setting of the film is magical. The content of this film has already been well described. IMO, this film is a masterwork. But new viewers should be very clear that this is a violent film, a very violent film! And at the same time, undeniably, a masterpiece!"
5,Correction,"Quick correction- this film, is in fact based on a true story. I'm from North Dakota but was living in Minneapolis, Minesota when it happened. I remember it quite clearly because of the brutality involved.BTW, I've been to most of the places this film was filmed (including the car dealership- I passed that on the way to school)"
5,"Exactly what I ordered, and delivered very shortly after purchased","I love this movie - it's funny, sad, thought provoking and just really really entertaining!"
3,Doesn't age well,"Looking at the movie after 15 years last night, whatever novelty there was is gone. I remember Ebert raving about the unusual dialogue of the movie. There's nothing distantly remarkable about that discourse exempt for the ridiculous accents and the idea that people in Mpls actually speak that way. Sure, Macy and McDormand have quirky characters at times, but there's really little grabbing about the movie. It's notable how brief the plot is and the elements of strong violence the story hangs on. A caricature without point and a drama without heart. Suspense? not really"
1,Senseless Killing,"Good acting, but....content and violence was terrible. Had nightmares for days!I would not recommend this movie unless you love senseless killing, blood, and watching sex."
1,A Waste Of Time and Money,"One of the least interesting movies ever to win acclaim as some sort of classic. The acting is serviceable, with William H. Macy turning in especially good work. Macy is the only cast member able to transcend the snickering juvenility of the Coen Brothers' script.Boring boring boring. A film best played as a way to induce slumber."
5,Surprised that I enjoyed it,When I saw this movie my expectations were low. I heard it was dark and graphic and not a very redeeming movie. I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed the writing and the acting. The moral or the story is actually somewhat redeeming. People do stuff that it wrong and then they face the natural consequences. All the time the cool headed police eventually get their man. They mock the accents of Minnesota in a funny way. This movie is still very dark but very well written.
5,great album,"i own every ATDI album except for El Gran Orgo. the other albums are relationship of command, vaya, and acrobatic tenement. in my opion, relationship of command is their best album with in/casino/out and vaya tied for second. if you are new to ATDI, start with relationship of command then move on to this album. this an excellent album, some of the standout songs are napolean solo, pickpocket, and hourglass. the first 2 songs arent really up to par with ATDI's other work, but the album takes off from there. overall an excellent album, just not their best"
3,Might be a little low,"This is a good cd. I believe relationship in command is quite possibly one of the best cds i own. The big problem with this cd is the under production. The quality is just not good. I am sure that if they were done when relationship of command was, they would be great, but the sound just isn't there. It's too quiet and doesn't get you up like ROC did. Still a pretty good cd which is why i said 3 stars might be low... 3 and 1/2 stars sounds fair."
5,Emo-Core At Its Best!,"The only thing better than this CD is their live performance! This is a band to watch out for....For those that have seen them live but haven't bought the CD, their strong charisma in concert carries over to this album. Absolutely amazing!"
4,this is a long term cd,"i started by getting the sparta cds, liked them, got mars volta, liked that too, heard about at the drive in so i went out and got in/casino/out. first time i listened to it, i thought it was average, a few more times and i got the hang of it, after a while it totally grew on me, this music really does grow the more you listen to it. i have ROC and acrobatic tenement and vaya, they are all very good, i feel this is a good medium of the albums. i can`t believe it took me so long to find this music, the only problem now is i can`t find any other bands quite like them, sparta is lacking, mars volta is going in a different direction........any suggestions?"
3,Time for a Reality Check,"This is a fine album, especially for completists of 60s Pop Rock, but I think it's overpraised. Let's face it: it's derivative. Emitt Rhodes is very talented, yes, but more as a copyist than a genius. Musically, it's a lot of fun, but as a lyricist, he left a lot to be desired: ""You been staying at home when you should be playing, you been dealing all alone when you should be praying"" (??) The last minute and a half of ""Face to the Floor"" is a coda of music played exactly the same way, note for note. Do you think McCartney would do that? And the second half of the CD does not stand up to the first. Don't get me wrong, I like this record and it's well worth owning, but if you want the real unappreciated gem of the 60s, stick with Village Green Preservation Society. IMHO. Thanks."
1,Defective battery,"I replaced my old battery with the ""new"" one, which lasted aproximately 1 month. So, they either sent me an old battery or a defective one. In any case I'm not buying anything else from that store."
1,SHORT Story! Not a Novel.,"I really enjoy Mr. Joyce's work in general. Note, however, that this is a 30-page short story that you might mistakenly purchase thinking its a full novel (given that it's priced as such).I was in a rush to grab some reading material before traveling the next morning. I was rather disappointed to find out how little there was to entertain me on a long flight."
4,Coolest thing since frozen beer glasses.,"What a fantastic idea! The shot glasses only last for about one or 2 shots before they start to leak. Also the packaging suggests using cola or juice as options instead of water. I have found that water is best. Shot glasses frozen from cola and juice tend to have imperfections causing them to leak, wasting precious liquor!!! Also, the shots measure less than an ounce each, but even with all these imperfections, the fact that you can drink out of an ice cube is fantastic. It never fails to impress my guests at parties."
1,Don't waste your money,"Despite the title, this is NOT a course. It is a simplistic overview of Turkish grammar, and not a very good one at that. Invest your money in the Routledge ""Turkish, A Comprehensive Grammar."" A little more expensive, but well worth it if you're a serious student of this delightful language. For courses, I highly recommend Oztopcu's Elementary Turkish. This title is unlike any course I have seen or own for any language. It is a model course, in my opinion. With this title, I recommend a good dictionary, one that shows word stress. Also concerning word and grammatical stress patterns, the Routledge title has excellent content and detail."
5,Well it is good!,"I would have spent the money on this cd if it only featured the hit, ""Wouldn't It Be Good"". This song had a cool video on MTV when it first came out, I was hooked, and the lyrics and score were great too. On the personal side, ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" wound up meaning alot more to me today in 2001 then it did when it was released in the 80's. This tune is rarely played on 80's retro stations but you'll recognize it when you hear it. Kershaw is a great artist who put together a string of hits but never quite pushed it over the top in the US with a mainstream following. I give Nik Kershaw's Anthology a great review, check it out!"
3,Let Down.,"This was a let down after BETTER..., SERVICES..., & THREE WAY. If this is the direction Heasley is headed in, as one reviewer states, then I'm not sure I'll even be buying the next LP. There are those who didn't like the change from shoegazing to power pop, and there are probably those who don't like the change from power pop to what's on SELECTED. Still, Heasley can always be hailed for moving ahead and beyond and trying something new. Hail Hail."
1,disappointing,Generic Charles Fort.Covers a decent range of creatures but is very biased leaning toward the skeptical side.Nice book to introduce cryptozoology or folkore to kids on.
1,Beware picky eaters.,"This book is full of fish and vegetable recipies. The recipies are a bit too time consuming. Since I am a picky, simple eater I was disapointed to find out that there are really only 4 recipies in the entire book that I would even think about making. These recipies are not for the midwesterner who may enjoy a meat and potato meal."

3,The Tornado,"Anyone wanting to learn about tornadoes would find this read very useful. Thomas Grazulis covers all aspects of tornadoes from the tornado life cycle, historical records of tornadoes, dismissing tornado myths, all the way to the present tornado conditions. While books of this kind can often drag on with facts and statistical data Grazulis mixes it up by adding historical accounts from others. These shared experiences really help the reader engage and for some connect more to what Grazulis is describing. There were several great illustrations and pictures; the only down-side of this is that the pictures were in black and white which at times made it difficult to make out what Grazulis was trying to show. Overall, this book is an excellent source of information. Grazulis obviously knows what he is talking about and wrote it so well that anyone could not only understand it but also become engaged and excited about the subject of tornadoes."
4,A Great Book On The Basics Of Tornadoes,"Written primarily for the layperson, The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm won't disappoint you if you're curious about the most enigmatic of atmospheric phenomenon. Grazulis is well known for his historical tornado data work (and has done a stellar job of it too) and has taken much of his knowledge, put it into this book, and made it accessible for the non-scientist. People like myself who are knowledgeable in the atmospheric sciences may find the book a bit basic, but we're not the target audience. Regardless of your knowledge, this book is an attractive read. In the light of the revision of the old Fujita scale of tornado intensity, I'd like to see a revised edition published."
3,"sadly, not for me","I love Dr.Hauschka products and wanted this to be the right cream for me...the size, the ingredients, the smell...all terrific. Unfortunately it irritated my dry sensitive skin and was nowhere near moisturizing enough. Sad. Had to return it."
3,DW092PK 20X TRANSIT EXPERIENCE,"I purchased the DW092PK Transit-Level package for the purpose of a profile survey at my local church. When I opened the box and viewed the instrument, I was very impressed with the look and the overall quality and detail given to the instrument design. However, it broke my heart when I could not get it to level. After trying numerous times, I decided to do a little research on the instrument, and later found out that the transit-level version, (DW092), Had To Be Calibrated on a regular bases. I was sad to return it due to this design flaw. If dewalt somehow decides to fix such a flaw, it will become a great competitor in the surveying market."
5,Great Autobiography,"After reading Leadership: Past, Present & Future I wanted to know more about President Theodore Roosevelt and this is a great book to learn more about this great man.5 Stars"
4,Common sense president,Our present politicians should have to read this autobiography!! It may instill some common sense in their actions. A primer on how to govern.
1,Not read,I simply downloaded this book in order to experiment with my new Kindle.I am still studying the Kindle `User manual`.
5,The Mother of All Presidential Memoirs,"Witty, quirky, profound, lyrical--this is one of the great American memoirs. The 1999 Modern Library and National Review rankers of the 100 great nonfiction books of the 20th century missed the boat on this one."
4,A Tough Read!,"I love Theodore Rossevelt, but it is no secret that he was a very educated man, much more so than my reading level. I've always wanted to learn his vantage point on his life, so it was a good read, but rather difficult."
5,"Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography","Things I didn't know about TR, a facinating look in to the things that made the man who he was.The only written thing I have written by my grandfather had to do with his admiration with the man. I strongly encourage anyone interested in politics or the Old West."
5,Perfect. Saved my Coolscan III from retirement.,"I recently upgraded to an intel iMac from a 12 years old 9600 (very fine tuned) with a broken heart - my Nikon Coolscan III (LS30) doesn't work with iMacs (no SCSI) or even OSX. One day, looking for a solution I found Ratoc's FR1SX FW - Ultra SCSI adapter. As I always do, I searched the web for reviews and opinions. Most were nice ones. So I decided to buy one.It's very Mac straightforward: plug & use. Amazing, works perfectly with Vuescan and is also MUCH faster than before - ok, the intel processor does its part here, but anyway it seems to be faster on data transmission.On where it counts, this adapter is doing its job nicely since I first plugged it on my intel iMac using OSX Leopard. So, I can only give it 5 stars for, together with Vuescan, bringing my Coolscan III back to life. And doing so in a very Mac way.Oh, I was almost forgetting to mention that this is VERY important to me because I still shoot mostly film."
3,"Raw, Lo-fi, underproduced rural Mississippi Blues","James ""T-Model"" Ford is the stereotypical old bluesman from rural Mississippi. However, he records for Blues/indie-rock label, Fat Possum out of Oxford, Mississippi. Ford's first album, _Pee Wee Get My Gun_, was ""primitive"" or lo-fi, up-beat, and had a peculiar emphasis on violence. _You Better_ doesn't live up to the quality or the intensity of the first. The album highlights Ford's idiosyncratic personality with songs like ""These Eyes,"" in which Ford imitates a girlfriend's voice. A pretty good version of ""Catfish Blues"" also appears on the album as ""The Old Number."" An interesting blues remix also turns up on the album. ""Pop Pop Pop"" is in the same vein as the material on fellow Fat Possum artist, R. L. Burnside's Come On In. Overall, I believe, this album suffers from underproduction. A lot of the material sounds like a first take. T-Model Ford can play good music, but some rehearsal and refinement wouldn't hurt the quality of the music."
3,Underachiever,"Given the strength of the cast, The Usual Suspects was a surprisingly down-beat and unambitious film. It was certainly watchable, but is a bit pointless - in announcing that the subject of proceedings is uncovering the identity of the mysterious Keyser Soze, it telegraphs the fact that There Will Be A Twist In The Ending And Keyser Will Turn Out To Be Someone You Didn't Expect (if there isn't, the film will just be plain dull), and unfortunately the twist is guessable after about three quarters of an hour, and all but inevitable by the time it arrives.Could have been better."
2,Forgive me this review,"Something just didn't sit right with me at the end of this movie. To be honest, I would have been happier had the twist at the end not been pulled.Even though Spacey delivers a bravura performance (more than worthy of his Oscar), the script itself seems to trip over its own feet at the end. Now, don't get me wrong, I found a lot of the plot quite entertaining, but pulling the rug out from under the viewer and wiping away 2 hours of movie in doing so doesn't instantly put me to my knees praising it.Also, it tries to be a little too stylish at points, making the protagonists of the story pull off these wild heists and stunts, yet never showing set-up, and giving them the ability to do this just because they're ""really good"" at what they do.But because it had an original idea, it was destined for classic status. I can live with that, but only because I don't agree."
1,No review,"I could not watch this DVD on my DVD player. I received a message that said..""Not viewable in your area. Please eject the disk"" I don't know what that means. I have never had a problem with a DVD from Amazon before."
2,What's the Fuss?,"Part of the 'cult' appeal of this film, I'm fairly sure, lies in its trick ending. This is all very well, but it's not a trick ending in the sense that it provides any clue to preceding events. For all the central characters to have spontaneously exploded would have been as relevant, certainly more entertaining to watch. The Usual Suspects is well acted, though shoddily filmed, clearly low-budget and cringingly self conscious. The premise itself - five criminals rounded up by a character who may or may not be Kaiser Szoze to commit a crime that may or may not have been committed - is the stuff of graduate film school. It's clever, but finally not clever enough. If you're going to take the best part of two hours to play an elaborate hoax, make sure the hoax is worth waiting for. This isn't. And as for the 'the trick is that there is no trick' school of thought; Sorry, that doesn't cut it either. Something either works or it doesn't."
3,"Disappointing ""Director's Commentary"" for Such a Fab Movie","Although ""The Usual Suspects"" is one of my favorite movies, the director's / screenwriter's commentary on the DVD is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I would never recommend the DVD if you are buying it mainly for this commentary. The commentary is boring, uninformative, amateur and gives irrelevant details such as ""There's my ring"" or ""I worked on the script on the 38th floor of that building in the background."" After hearing the commentary, I am convinced that the movie's greatness is due to the experience, brilliance and personal input (changes in the original script) of the actors. I would have preferred to see some of the many out-takes rather that be subjected to the drivel contained in the commentary. Full marks (5 stars) to the actors. Zip to the commentary."
1,Wow A Picture Book With TRAILERS,Gee you shouldn't have. I read somewhere that this disc would have all of the extras ported over from the special edition and that the movie would be remastered. Well there are no extras only movie trailers. About the remastering well my picture book makes no mention of it. I did not buy the old blu ray because there were no extras. Now I have a 'picture' book with no extras. Maybe that's why Amazon didn't bother putting up a picture. I upgraded this disc with Se7en. The latter is a COMPLETE book with a superior picture and great EXTRAS. This picture book SO not worth the money. Buyer beware!
5,Where in the world is Kaiser Sosee?,DUH! A great movie for all time. An oscar level performance by Kevin Spacey. Another great performance from the Crossing Delancy star Gabriel Byrne. I liked Chazz better in Oscar.
1,Highly overated,"Not a great movie, bad direction, A waste of talent, not hard to figure out and Kevin Spacey is overrated as a actor, but fits for this generation of mindless drones. The subject of crime/ mystery / suspense is a great thing and there are much better movies out there to see. It's gets one star for the actors that were in it. Terribly boring and disjointed. How it gained so many awards is a mystery. Didn't this director go on to direct "" Apt Pupil"" another terrible film?!"
2,Mildly amusing the first time through...,"but this film is by no means a classic. The cute ending is good for a chuckle, however this is not enough to warrant repeat wiewings."
3,Good... but not that good.,"Perhaps I am being too critical, but I found this flick to be a bit predictable. How often does Kevin Spacey play a weak, stupid little pawn in someone else's game? He's too loved, too big of a name, and I quickly figured out that he must have some plan up his sleeve. Wise-cracking, clever Spacey would never be cast in the kind of roll that this movie would have its viewers believe. Not a bad watch for a bit of unchallenging entertainment, though. But it wasn't entertaining enough to make me want to watch it again or even to recommend it to my friends. No hard feelings, all right?"
5,Great neo-noir!,"Definitely one of those films that is better on re-viewing (I fell asleep the first time I watched it!), the film both pays homage to and debunks many classic noir themes/motifs, from the threatening and oppressive city-scapes to the over-riding sense of doom, and the by now famous ""double-cross"" at the end. People either love or hate this movie, and I suspect the latter are types who insist that reality is reality and, in Matrix lingo (another great neo noir!) there IS a spoon!"
1,Unusual Hosannas,"A film so in love with itself that it spirals consistently out of control to the point that it can't even keep up with itself, the final act - the alleged ""surprise"" that you saw coming like a runaway freight train - isn't an epiphany but a sloppy under-the-table hand-job that burned and frayed you for 90+ minutes without a happy ending. It's a bad con job that mystifyingly has grown a cult following over the years. My grade: C+"
2,Too violent and too much bad language,"violence with too much bad language. the story is good, but you have to get through a lot of junk to get to it"
4,Good entertainment,"I am not a fan of Stephen Baldwin and it is mainly through the acting of the other principles that this movie carries 4 stars, especially Kevin Spacey. Although a bit more gratuitous violence than I like, I would consider the content to be tame by modern ""Over The Top"" action movies. This is a movie that gets you to think and watch it again. I actually quoted a line from the movie in a casual conversation (I do not want to spoil the plot ending) about Kaiser Sosze and got a good laugh."
2,extremely over-blown crime thriller,"very over-blown with tepid writing, direction, and acting. definitely not oscar-worthy but better than the typical fare of the same genre. not bad as a rental or a simple movie to pass the time, but all in all it's not very good, original, or groundbreaking"
5,Murder mystery without peer,"This is one of the best movies of its type that I have ever seen. It is a modern classic in my opinion. I have never heard of anyone who didn't like it, buy it, you won't be sorry."
1,Defective video,The video came in damaged. Every couple of minutes the screen would get white with static and it would end up impossible to follow the whole sequence step by step. After several failed intents to viewing the video it started humming inside my VHS so I decided to put it away. Since shipping and reclaims takes time now I'm looking for this video with a local dealer.
1,Unwatchable production,"It's possible the content of this DVD is worth 5 stars, but I'll never know. My husband and I couldn't watch it because of the constant camera angle changes. Just as we'd start to become engrossed in a dancer's moves, they'd switch to an overhead shot or, annoyingly, one from underneath the stage. My husband and I were equally irritated by this and could not even finish watching it.This film is like those movie montage ""previews"" that show you a snippet of dozens of films without pausing long enough for you to take in what any one of them is. For this reason, this DVD is unwatchable and a total waste of time and money."
1,Forget taste,"If you want to see what the stage show was like, do not get this video.If you want to see something enjoyable, do not get this video.If you want to see how a great show can be massacared by poor taste, get this video.This video reprents the excesses of a narcisstic editor who is more interested in creating an abstract hurly burly of juxtaposed images than in helping the user enjoy a great visual feast. It is like somebody doing a video about an artist's paintings insisting on placing colored and distorting lenses on their cameras to misrepresent the artwork.Yes, this style is OK for a 3-minute music video where the star of the show is the music. This style is completely unacceptable when it is an hour long video that is supposed to show a dance.This video represents the peak of poor taste and bad editing. If you want to see dance on video, get the video ""Riverdance."" If you want to see ""Lord of the Dance"" (which is great), you have to see it on the stage."
3,Quality only overwhelmed by ego,"This guy is a real star, and this video proves it, however, there is a big ego floating around everything, sometimes surpassing the quality of the coreographies."
1,Lord of the Dance,"I found the quality of the DVD just horrible - the lighting was very poor which made some of the sequences blurry. Sometimes the lights shined right at you so you could see what they were doing.. Also, I found Michael Flatley so arrogant and conceited. At the end of the show, he overdid it with encores, and instead of thanking the audience, he just kept saying Yes!! Yes!! Not one bit of humbleness. He didn't seem to know that you might be extremely talented, but you are nothing if you don't have an audience. In my opinion, this is not worth the buy.."
1,BORING,Too much of slow motion .Y believe flatley has an enourmous talent and could produce somthing new instead of trying to repeat riverdance which is unique.
2,"Big production, even bigger ego!","Riverdance, even when Flatley was in it, was a classy show. It had lots of varying elements to it, but was always enriching and fun. LORD OF THE DANCE is Flatley's run for the brass ring -- all spectacle, little substance. Sure, the dancing is top-notch (as it was in Riverdance), but the storyline is borderline silly and cornball. I saw this show live from a front row seat and really fought hard to keep the performers from noticing the pained look on my face during the show's moments of forced sentimentality and cuteness. An appropriate movie analogy for this show might be INDEPENDENCE DAY -- visually impressive but hampered by a script so lame and insulting that you'd just as soon watch it with the sound turned completely off. That's the rub with LOTD. Looks great, but less filling than Riverdance. My advice? Skip this one."
4,Good deal...,"After doing research on what type of watch I was looking for, I found the perfect active watch in this Chase Durer...I would recommend online service for purchase to anyone..."
2,Review of seller,"I know the book, was happy to get an inexpensive new edition. But the book contains underlining in ink, and the pages were bent, some misshapen by exposure to moisture. Mailing envelope was a grocery bag -- not an inherent problem, and I recycle, but not very protective of the book."
4,A work of poetry,"Not the easiest book to read, but the ideas contained within it are well worth the effort of trying to understand them."
5,BEAUTIFUL WELL DONE MOVIE,This dvd is a perfect transfer! Subtitles are on par and the quality is superb considering it's source. I completely disagree with the negative review from the other reviewer.It is possible he was in a bad mood? Either way this is the only copy of this movie that exists and it's a must for anyone who studies film or is a fan of the genre. I am not going to spoil the movie for you!
5,Excellent !!!!,"This is the best all-around live blues album of the last 30 years. Danny Kalb's singing is superb, as well as his guitar execution, albeit one or two minor flops, which can be excused for the wholesome performance of this band. ""Caress me Baby"", featuring the strong organ back up of Al Kooper and Danny's punishment of his own fingers, blend in one of the richest blues live performances ever, only comparable to that of ""Have you ever loved a woman"" in E.C. and the Dominoes' Live at the Fillmore. A must-have for any blues lover."
1,These started coming up right away,"I followed the instructions on the package, making sure the tub was clean and dry before applying. No luck. They started coming up after the first shower. There's nothing wrong with my tub surface, because my previous set lasted a couple of years. I wish I could find another pack of those."
3,bathtub decals,"I would allow it to ""dry"" 48 hours before using the shower. I followed the directions and gave it 24 hours, but some have already peeled off and it has been 3 months."
1,These suck,"I really wish I had not wasted my money on these things. We bought them to put in the tub for our baby who has just transitioned out of an infant tub. I cleaned the tub well, let it dry, then wiped the surface with alcohol, and let it dry again. (Just as a side note, our tub is completely smooth and not textured.)I put these down and on the first use of the tub 2 of them came off. Ever since then they have been peeling up one at a time. SO annoying and unsafe for my little one. If I could return these pieces of crap and get my money back I would. If they actually stuck like they are supposed to, they would be great. During the first use of them they really kept my baby from sliding around in the tub. Now that so many of them have come up she slides around and gets upset. If I didn't need the ones that are still hanging on to stick until I can get more, I would have ripped them up a week ago. Don't waste your money."
1,Heed what others say: USELESS,"Cute and nice-sized about is all I can say good.Our tub was triple-scrubbed and squeaky clean and dry. I let them sit for over a day before using.It only took about 2 days before one came off. Then, the others started lifting and becoming half-on and half loose.I spent more time cleaning and applying them than they lasted in taking showers. Total waste of time. Heed what people say: Don't buy them."
2,"After just 2 months, stickers are peeling off","The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because while the stickers are holding on, they definitely create a safer bath tub floor but it's only been 2 months since I've installed them and a few are already coming off. I've followed instructions and washed and dried the bathtub before putting the stickers on. Disappointing."
1,poor quality,"I've bought binders from wal-mart for 75cents that were better quality than these binders.The plastic tag for labels wasn't even aligned to the binder, they were sticking outside the binder so I tried to pull it out since it looked bad, but that ripped the outside portion of the binder."
4,Contains truly amazing prophecies! (see below),"In chapter 3 of this book (published 1996) a foundation meeting of a proposed space tourism company 'Share Space Global' takes place on Friday 16th July 1999. Those attending are influential and wealthy opinion leaders including Messrs Gates, Eisner, Forbes, Branson & JFK Jr. If you cross reference the dates our authors have from more than three years in the past picked the exact date of JFK's demise! On reflection he probably would have preferred to attend this foundation meeting!"
4,A Believable Story,"Contrary to an earlier reviewer, I found the Tiberians to be some of the best thought-out aliens in SF writing. The parallels with our own societies was hard hitting and to the point. While it was a bit dry and technical, this is the first SF novel I've read in a long time where I finished by thinking..""Yes. This could happen.&quot"
3,Interesting tale,"People tend to love or hate this book I noticed, but personally I found it akin to Barnes's other novels which I have enjoyed, but simultaneously get annoyed by. Buzz's authorial voice is hard to pull apart from Barnes except where there's a lot of technical concepts flying around - definitely Buzz's material there. A curious omission that many have missed is its silence about the violation of conservation of momentum that the deccelerator loop on the Earth Starship causes - at no point do the authors note the large accelerations such a thing would cause. Also its flight-time seems to be based on non-relativistic calculations - these aren't major errors, but odd considering Buzz's meticulous details on other technical matters."
5,I confess- I loved this book!,"A facinating thriller that is truly hard to put down. George Grayson takes the reader on a journey through the worlds of international finance and espionage with a masterful touch. Grayson imbues his work with a level of sophistication, scholarship and attention to detail that is unusual for the genre. This book has something for everyone: attorneys will enjoy the jabs at large lawfirm life, while those with an interest in international intrigue will be well satisfied. The story begins with the murder of an associate at a large lawfirm. His sister, refusing to believe his death was a suicide, recruits a law professor (a former federal prosecutor) to help her investigate his death. Together they plunge into a web of intrigue involving the Chinese government and the search for a mysterious, lost shipment of gold."
1,The director can't koepp,A cartoon featuring a performance so bad that you'll be begging for six degrees of seperation from Kevin Bacon.
2,Predictable,"Sorry, but I was expecting more. Save for the part where the ghost is sitting next to him on the couch, this didn't have that suspense that I was looking for. It definitly ranks way behind ""the others"" and ""sixth sense"". The acting isn't too bad, which makes it watchable, but there's just not much to it."
4,not a horror movie,"I rented Stir of Echoes by accident one night-it was in another movie snap-case. I'm glad because this was one of best directed movies I've seen in the 90s'. It's like The Sixth Sense only not as sophisticated. Kevin Bacon (Jake) gives a very convincing performance as the freaked out brother-in-law of Illeana Douglas (Lisa). Illeana Douglas is just plain convincing (as an actor) in anything she's in. Not scary but somewhat a ""mind movie"" Worth the money."
3,Comparisons are inevitable...,"... this movie, like The Sixth Sense, is worth a second viewing. Unlike Sense, however, this film's secrets and ending are easily figured out, so if you are watching for the mystery of it all, it's a strictly middle of the road work. But if you want to see Kevin Bacon's best work to date, this an absolute MUST SEE. His maturity as an actor is evident in his emotional angst over his gift, and his borderline-deranged characterization as the obsession becomes more and more overpowering is reminiscent of the intensity seen in Brolin's Amityville Horror or Nicholson's The Shining characters.Directorially, this film holds its own against Sense, with clever interplays between this world and the next to keep you off balance, tense music and expert emotion-manipulation.Definitely worth a look."
4,A 'Stir' in the Neighborhood,"Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) wanted to be hypnotized, so he did. Big mistake. He then saw glimpses of spirits and events that happened in the past. A 'receiver' as a mysterious cop told his wife. Witzky is sick of his pathetic life and doesn't realize what he has. His wife doesn't know what's wrong with him, but his son knows. There's a secret in Chicago that's about to be uncovered and a girl's murder will come to justice. I liked this more than ""The Sixth Sense"" because of its characters. Better performances and a better story. He tried to uncover the mystery throughout the whole movie, but little Haley Joel tried to help a spirit at the end of that movie. It just didn't belong there. In this, it does. I don't know if I can listen to The Rolling Stones again. Kevin Bacon is definitely a good actor. Think twice about children who have imaginary friends, they might be ghosts."
5,yeah dig that hole!,"half the movie is Kevin Bacon shoveling in the backyard. I enjoyed it from a documentary standpoint on how to landscape and stuff. I was just waiting for that Bob Vila guy from this old house to come along and start doing the play by play, acting like he was buddies with the shoveling guy. His wife is cute and also very smart. In real life it might happen cops can be slow sometimes. The homeowners association should have been all over this though!"
3,Stir of Echoes,"I enjoy watching Kevin Bacon in his varying performance roles! He excells in any role he's in! Also liked the performance by his starring actress, Katherine Erbe, who also stars in t.v. role on Law & Order Criminal Intent. What's lacking in the Story Line, is made up for in the quality of acting!Not my usual genre of story line interest - Soooo - I rented once and watched once!"
5,This is a must see,"This movie was very good it's makes you wonder if theres a ghost in your home. This movie was about a man who is haunted by this ghost who was trying to guide him to the true of her death. In the meantime his friends thinks he crazy ,and his wife understands whats going on ,but can't get a connection. This movie keep you involved and in suspence worth buying."
3,Psychological thriller ?,"_A Stir of Echoes_ is thrown begrudgingly into the Horror genre. It's more of a thriller really but the fear of what are commonly refered to as ""Boo's"" throw it into Horror. The psychological elements should have been better highlighted. Kevin Bacon's character needed to understand that the new knowledge he has been recently made aware is not really new information. He comes to no real thought in the progress of the film. The other big problem with the screenplay is the use of the dais ex machina. Though the filming of the dais ex machina scenes was excellent, the continual dependence on those elements (the psychic cop) produces a film with no real heart or lesson to be learned."
4,Good but...,"Good film, but basically the same story as Peter Medak's The Changeling, a very well-made and frightening ghost story."
2,"Only ok, and I usually like supernatural stories","I don't remember this movie when it first came out. But it's funny - it reminded me of a poor man's version of 'Sixth Sense', except they were released within weeks of each other, so it wasn't a direct knock-off. Either way, this is not very well told, and good actors only do a mediocre job. I usually like supernatural tales, but this one disappointed."
4,"Not perfect, but pretty darn good","Some good points made in previous reviews on the missed potential for including additional stuff (commentary, other performances, etc.)in this 2 DVD set, but it is very nice to have all the videos in this format for long time fans and newbies alike. Comments on the quality of the surround sound may be a bit overstated and compares apples to oranges when comparing it to the Eagles Hell Freezes Over DVD (that show was miked and recorded with digital sound in mind). Knowing how much Bruce cares about the products he produces, I'm sure the audio engineers did the best they could considering the wide variety of analog source material. If you have a decent home theater setup that includes an A/V receiver with a variety of DSP (Digital Sound Processing) modes, you will find one that that sounds fine."
3,Not what I expected,"These were very soft compared to the Stretch Island products that I am used to. I expected that based on other reviews...what I didn't expect was how absolutely bland these were. Not very ""tropical"" at all but still okay to eat. My younger daycare kids should enjoy these as they will be easier for them to eat."
5,Perfect for the Medium Sized Job,"First off, the price was unbelievable so I really had to try this sauce pot. And now that I've had it for a month, I don't know how I lived without it. I never thought that I'd go for a pot that didn't have the traditional long handle (this one has two loop handles) but now that I've used this on a semi-crowded stove, I won't go back.The pot itself is the perfect size for ""doctoring"" up to two jars of spaghetti sauce, and for making a good amount of mashed potatoes that you can make right in the pan without worrying about scratches to the surface like in non-stick cookware. And it's beefy enough to not worry about it walking around the burner when you stir a sauce.This puppy is a real workhorse that I'll look forward to having for many years."
3,A Cook's Dream !,Wonderful size for a pot of soup for two! Cleans like a dreamand is so well manufactured. With care should last a lifetime!
4,Best Pan Ever!,"I was reluctant to order, but my cheapy grocery store pans just weren't cutting it and the price hypnotized me! I ordered from Amazon and got it quick last year. We followed instructions to the letter because it's the most expensive pan I've owned. We purposely FRIED foods in it early on, (Chicken and French Fries) It seasoned the pan perfectly. I assumed because it wasn't ""non-stick"" that it would be difficult to clean..boy was I wrong! Just soak for a few minutes and cleans like a ""non-stick"" pan. It seasons meat so well..I had no idea what a difference it makes to use for flavoring meats and making sauces and gravies! Only drawback is that the handles get too hot. Using potholders is difficult due to the design. BUT: The price on this one makes it so that I could have such a terrific pan... I LOVE LOVE IT! I want more and am going to try the 2 1/2 qt saucepan.... Eventually I want to the whole set!"
4,professional?,"this is a functional sauce pot. it came scratched and it gets scratched real easy . i guess i am not sure what hard anodized coating means! it is a good size for many purposes . personally , i do not like anodized as , again , it scratches easily and then looks kind of bad. otherwise it is a heavy duty little pot . i prefer commercial stainless blend as it is tougher and heats well. bottom line is the price is right scratch prone or not , this is a good mid size sauce pot"
2,Terrible.,"Consists, more than anything, of these extended ""affirmations"" where you're supposed to repeat phrases like ""I have a great memory""... that's MOST of the entire cd.Otherwise, they do mention some tips for trying to remember names, and do actually discuss a technique to use in trying to remember a list of items.But hey... what if you have a JOB that requires you to be on top of myriad facts and concepts, formulas, etc... that are not arranged in neat little lists. My father-in-law can read engineering manuals that are boring as can be, and he can retain the info. This tape/cd is USELESS for providing hints at how to tackle stuff like that. Sure, it's great for parlor tricks: memorize names of people in an audience and develop the ability to memorize a list of anything the audience wants you to memorize... but nothing more."
4,A Fantastic Therapy Session!,"Bonnie Bernell uses her own experiences as well as those of other ""bountiful"" women to provide readers with the ammunition to live their lives to the fullest. Her manner is gentle and caring as she addresses issues that we as women of size face on a daily basis from the ""meaningful"" parents who berate us for our size to the airplane seat that is too narrow to finding Mr. Right. Ms. Bernell's advice is reasonable as well as doable. After reading Bountiful Women, I felt as though I had undergone a much needed but extremely inexpensive therapy session! I recommend that all large women and the people who love them treat themselves to Ms. Bernell's ""secrets."" It is a book that you will pick up again and again for inspiration and encouragement."
2,Sub-par by Pete.,"I'm a bit hesitant to review this album because it has its ups and downs. ""Gandules"" as well as ""La Rumba es Mia"" are very good songs, reminiscent of the 70's. On the other hand, there are some choice of songs that I question like for example ""El Rey"" and ""Que te Pedi"". No one except for La Lupe should ever sing that song. But this CD's ultimate downfall is it's sound quality. It seems as a cassette were playing instead of a CD. I can't stress how bad it sounds. Not sure if its remastered,but you should wait for this one if its not."
3,worst remaster ever ?,"The music is superb, but if you are going to buy this one expecting a better sound, don't do it. The MCA one sounds much better than this ""remastered"" version, and will cost you less than half the money. This must be the worst remaster ever done if they did it at all. As a matter of fact the cd doesn't say it's a remaster. I wonder where AMAZON got that information. Highly NOT recommended."
4,**Blues to the Max**,I just have two words to say. Joe Walsh and God Bless him. Not many people know of Joe Walsh before he energized the hell out of The Eagles. His version of B. B. King's You're Gonna Need Me is worth the price of admission. Walsh's approach to soloing is always on the edge of disaster which makes listening to him more exciting with each replay. This live album shows three top players in fine form armed only with their instruments. The roughness of the mix adds realism to the recording and is a true document of a great and short lived band. Nuts to all who says it stinks.
4,Not a bad song on this,"But, that said, the editing between songs is a bit choppy in places.But this is a fine effort and the band is on display at the peak of their days just before Joe left for greener pastures."
2,Boring and Silly,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a boring, silly film. It's hard to believe that Alfred Hitchcock had anything to do with this. I wasted over an hour watching it and it's just not worth spending any more time reviewing it. Not a good film."
5,Extremely Funny!,"This is a funny movie! It should be put on DVD. If you are expecting a mystery from Hitchcock, this is not the movie to see, but if you are looking for a funny and entertaining film, this is a great one. I recommend this to everyone. Go see it."
1,Not sure what all those great reviews were.,"Hoping for a really good collection of Jefferson Airplane. Instead a CD with only 2 known hits, and a lot of songs I can't even remember. Very disappointed with this collection."
4,surrealistic pillow cd,I am enjoying the cd very much and appreciate the extra cuts and historical info. It really does bring back old times and is more convenient than listening to the original vinyl lp I have. Thanks
2,comparison...,"i have an earlier cd of this, but was intrigued by the remastering and the additional tracks.disappointed, to say the least. the remastering is...louder. compressed, to the point where everthing smears, and the (originally over-used) reverbs bury over everything. the mastering could have been more subtle, more respectful of the limitations of the original record (rather than a modern paint-by-numbers mastering)for me at least, the earlier cd is cleaner, clearer.as for the bonus tracks: whatever.am giving this to my brother, and keeping the older cd(altho the booklet in the new one was fun to read)"
5,Remastered Surrealistic Pillow?,"I purchased both the ""remastered"" import versions of Surrealistic Pillow and Crown of Creation. Both CDs have bonus tracks and it has been claimed that each has been digitally remastered. However, if you study both the CD and the accompanying insert, there is no statement whatever to suggest that these CDs are remastered. Though listening tests are subjective, neither of these CDs sounded superior in audio quality. The widely available recent U.S. reissue of Surrealistic Pillow--including stereo and mono versions of both songs but no bonus tracks--actually claims to be remastered (e.g., note info on audio restoration & digital transfers) and sounds superior to the European import w/ bonus tracks."
2,"Nice looking, good price, but...","I wouldn't buy another one. It is comfortable enough (with a cushion), but it REALLY needs another position or two for the back rest. There is no position just above the horizontal, so I usually need to use a pillow for sunbathing or dozing. Another position between upright and midway would also be nice. I had no problems with assembly. But as other reviewers have pointed out, cedar is a very soft wood. I haven't had any problem with the slats, but the good looking legs could hardly be designed worse for a wood that splits so easily. There probably is a luck element with getting the right piece of wood. But I have had to glue the back legs back together at least three times in pretty normal usage. (Okay, one time while watering I tripped and fell backwards onto the lounge. But that shouldn't merit two legs breaking.) I ended up drilling across the splits and inserting large screws along with gluing. So far, so good."
4,Decent lounge chair for a fair price,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product after reading some mixed reviews. I would say that the directions could use some more clarity, but other than that, an easy installation that won't take you more than an episode of CSI to complete. I got a cushion for it at Home Depot for $55 that spruced it up quite a bit...I'll be buying a few more of these as soon as the snow melts."
4,Very nice chaise to lounge around in. This is the life !,"I purchased 2 of these mainly because of the price. I really enjoy them. My husband put them together. ( He was so happy to get to use his power drill) It took about less than a 1/2 hour to put each together. This chair is sturdy but I would't say its top quality. The wood quality is so-so. But what can you expect for the price? The chair's slide out table is very functional. We lie out on them in the evening on these breezy summer nights with a cup of tea , look at the stars, and just talk. This is the life !"
3,Not as good as the first album,"I am not nearly as hard on this release as some reviews here. The Flock was looking for direction here and trying new things. Dinosaur Swamps is very progressive and even psychedelic and showed that the Flock was not afraid of stretching into other areas (other bands have done it quite successfully, like Jethro Tull for example). Unfortunately, the Flock could not get it to work for them and it shows in this second and last recording (actually the Flock released a third album a couple of years later minus Jerry Goodman that was terrible). This recording grew on me and after several listens I really began to like it and appreciate the muscianship. Remember, the Flock always had a different sound that must be approached with an open and tuned mind. So if you are a listener of underground rock bands of this period the Flock's recordings should be in your collection."
1,Nearly unlistenable,"I bought this to hear pre-Mahavishnu Jerry Goodman. The group should be good, with Goodman and the horns. However, the material is very weak. The lyrics and vocals are mediocre at best, but the songs are poor. I can listen to almost anything but I draw the line here. Is it worth it to hear Jerry Goodman? Maybe for one listening."
2,not a good transition from swaddlers,"Perhaps it's because we're going from the very effective Pampers Swaddlers, but we've found that these leak horribly. They are not especially roomy so it may be that we're between sizes and that has something to do with it - but for now we won't be using these anymore."
5,Wonderful,"We loved these diapers. We wanted to go with cloth diapers, but the last diaper service in our area went out of business three months before our daughter was born. I knew I did not have it in me to do the cloth diapers by hand. We did some research into diapers that were the least harmful to the environment, and we came up with these. They have worked great!!"
3,The quality has gone down hill,"Seventh Generation are bragging that they have new and improved diapers. Fact of the matter is, the previous version is much better. The ""stick-tacks"" are not as adhesive I guess because they open even you don't want them to, and in fact my son for the first time woke up on a wet mattress, as the diaper openend sometime at night...I've been a faithful client with 7th Gen eveer since my son was born and liked their product alot. This so-called ""new and improved"" version however sucks!I'm looking for alternatives for 7th Gen when it comes to disposable chlorine free and well absorbing diapers. If anyone knows, please let me know!"
1,Very poor quality diapers ...,"This diaper is of very poor quality. The tabs are not properly attached and hence, when you are putting on the diaper the tab comes off very often. This is annoying as I then have to toss the diaper. A waste of my money!"
4,Excellent diapers for baby and environment!,"Seventh Generation diapers are great, although I admit that I do still switch back & forth between these and Pampers Cruisers. The only reason I give them four stars is that they have leaked on me a few times and the Pampers Cruisers have never. I would definitely recommend the Seventh Generation diapers!!!Pros: Soft, Excellent for baby (chemical free!), Better for baby's skin, Great for Environment, Comparable price to other diapers, Disposable for busy lifestyles.Cons: Have leaked on a few rare occasions and NOT because my baby was overdue for a change"
4,no problems,"These dipaers are just as good as regular diapers and just as easy to use. They are made slightly larger than the regular ones in each respective size, so keep this in mind when ordering."
2,Bummer,"I was really dissapointed to find that I had to wash my daughter's bedding nearly every morning due to leaking through. Also, and more importantly, my daughter started having horrible diaper rash. I think the diapers were not doing a sufficient job at wisking the wettness away from her bottom. I went back to our original diapers and used some wonderful cream called tripple paste and the rash is finally gone. (She battled it for at least a month until I finally figured out that it was probably not healing b/c of these diapers)"
2,Leaks at night,"I was so excited to find a reasonable price in a chlorine free diaper, but the diapers do not hold up to my 9 month old that is sleeping 8-10hrs at night. He wakes up soaked so we have had to switch back to Pampers for night time. The diapers do hold up to all other messes when changed frequently during the day and I don't mind the non-white color of the diaper. I will continue to use these diapers during the day but disappointed that I have to switch back and forth. Also the diapers run very small, so you might want to order bigger than other diapers."
5,Love these diapers!,"I love these diapers they are soft, very absorbent, and fit well. I had been using Pamper's Swaddlers which I really liked a lot, but knowing that there was a more environmentally friendly option out there I had to try them. I was not disappointed. The Seventh Generation diapers are far better than I would have expected. Having used other Seventh Generation paper products which are scratchy and have a funky smell, I expected the diapers to be stiff and unappealing. In fact they are quite the opposite. The diapers are soft and fit well. So far no leaks either, even at night. I have tried other eco friendly diapers, but these are by far the best in every respect (softness, fit, absorbency)."
5,No More Diaper Rash!,"My son was suffering from a diaper rash/yeast infection for over 2 months...nothing worked. We switched to these diapers, and ta-da!"
5,LOVE THESE DIAPERS!,"Chlorine & perfume free & environmentally friendly, the closest thing to a cloth diaper without the hassle you can get! They are incredibly soft and work just as well if not better as the leading brands!"
2,Not worth the extra time pretreating all of my sons laundry,"I purchased these diapers hoping that I would make less of an environmental impact with disposable diapers. I spent so much more time and energy with the laundry that it just was not worth it. These diapers didnt really fit my son all that well. Despite the fact that he is at the lower end of the weight range, they were too small. I wont purchase these again."
4,comparable to huggies,"I bought these without expecting too much. I just wanted to try a diaper that wasn't as bad for the environment as most. I always use premium diapers because I feel spending less on diapers that always leak is not worth the money you save. So I really feel that these diapers hold up just as well as Huggies, my preferred brand, and they make me feel a little bit better about all of those diapers I'm dumping. Note: I have not tried these for overnight use because my son leaks out of every other diaper I've tried except Huggies Overnites.Huggies Overnites Diapers, Step 5 (27+ Lbs), 27-Count Packages (Pack of 2) (54 Diapers)"
1,worst ever..,"I thought I'd try them because them seemed like a smart choice...now my son's bottom is paying the price. He never had a rash before compared to this, a painful swollen red area... poor guy!Beware, not all babies react the same, if your current choice is working, don't fix it!"
5,Excellent!,Both my kids (a newborn and a 2 yr old) are using this product and all I can say is that we are very satisfied.
2,Rather disappointed,"I really was glad I decided to switch to these diapers and I was hopeful that they would work well for us as they had many positive reviews. Unfortunately they do not work well at all. Nearly every time we use them they leak. Normally we use cloth at home, but when we travel and at day care we use these. They leak almost every time unless you change the diaper every hour or hour and a half. What a shame!"
5,Good to be green!,"You know...I was really expecting these diapers to suck. I thought, ""Do I really want to risk leaking on my suit as I bring my kid to the office with me?"" It turns out I like these BETTER then 'normal' diapers. These things are AWESOME! When I opened up the package and saw the plain beige color I was telling myself, ""Oh geez. Leak city."" But they hold up and take in EVERYTHING. Even if you are not looking to lessen the impact on the environment you should give these a try. I think you will really like what you buy."
2,Extremely bad quality control. Falling apart out of the package.,"Yes the product would have been nice if there were some sort of quality control. The diapers are soft and absorbent, adequate size, seems comfortable. The only problem is the defect rate is very high. You would expect 1 or 2 at most out of a 140 PAMPERS bag to be defective. But this is 10~15 times over that. The excessive glue on the diapers requires you to rip it apart to open the diaper. It is less of a problem compared to the falling Velcro strips. I once has 7 diapers in a row with the Velcro strip gone. It is quite frustrating when you are holding the baby's legs with your one hand at the same time."
4,"Good product, love it!","I've been using this sine my baby was born, now for 9 months, never had a leakage problem, the new fit is better, slimmer, the old design was so bulky. Unlike other brands, this has no bleach/chemical smell during use, There was a bag of defective diapers though, one end has no valcore, Amazon ordered exchange quickly, no complains."
5,NO MORE DIAPER RASH!!,"I could not figure out what was causing my baby's diaper rashes. I thought she was lactose intolerant, she was allergic to something, etc. I had never even heard of unbleached diapers before. So I searched for something online and came across these. I bought these and the wipes, and when I use both she NEVER gets a rash. I was worried about leaks and I haven't had one problem in months of using these. I am so thankful for these diapers, now I don't have to cringe every diaper change."
4,No more dank chemical diaper smells,"It took our 1 year old about a week to adjust to the new diaper. We switched from Pamper's Swaddlers. She had a rash for the first few days, but then it went away. The 7th Gen diapers is not as form fitting as Pamper's, but they absorb smell and waste just as well, if not better. We are fans of 7th Gen products, and the diapers cost about the same as Pamper's! A win win win for baby, Dad's wallet, and good ole Mother Earth."
4,great production,This is a wonderful production of O'Neills most beautiful plays. All the stars are perfactly cast and play the parts out to their best. Worth it!
5,An all time classic,"This is a truly great novel, perhaps it fades just a bit toward the end, at which time Fitzgerald was allegedly engaged in an amphetamine fueled rush to conclude the story after years of working on it. Defintely worth reading."
4,Good Music/Not-As-Good Vocals,"As with all other Dream Theater albums, the music is awesome--the band is really talented, and that really shows. The problem is that I had gotten used to LaBrie's vocals on the other albums, and so hearing Charlie's came as a bit of a shock. Let's just say that firing him and getting LaBrie was the best move they ever made. Anyway, it's still Dream Theater, so it's still cool."
1,Bad 80s Music,"I bought this used at a record shop because it was in the Heavy Metal bin & I liked the cover, sort of. But it's just bad ""look how fast we can play"" 80s rock. Some of it is ""we're boring dino-farts"" Genesis [blech! ]style pomp-rock. If you are into REAL Metal like Rage Against The Machine, Korn & Marilyn Manson, skip this 80s trash. If you're into bad hair+scales=bad rock from the 80s, by all means, lap it up!"
4,The Informer,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
1,THE OMEN,"I have marked 1 star, otherwise I can't go on with this procedure. But the truth is I can't rate ""The Omen"" at all, because I could never play it. Blu-Rays from Fox are always so tricky and so slow to load (why is that, when Warner or Columbia Blu-rays, for instance, are so easy and fast?) that I was'nt wandering why it was taking about ten minutes to get the main menu on screen. But when I cliked ""Play"", the menu dissappeared, but the image on the backgroung kept playing, and playing, and playing forever.I just could'nt watch the movie.An excellent reason to forget about Fox, as long as they don't correct these defficiencies."
3,Damien ain't no Micheal Myers!!!,"This movie has a very good plot, but is lacking in special effects.Since Damien was supposed to be the anti-christ, I do think that he should have done most of the evil deeds."
2,a snore,"this book is great because it lists the addresses of where these legendary rock stars stayed when they were creating magic and madness, but i found the book somewhat dull. you also get a feel for this period from david geffens biography which was published a few years back. also, i'm not sure any of the names in the book are relevant anymore. James taylor came out with a christmas album, sheesh."
5,Most convenient,"I guess the best way to tell you how much I like and use this pan is to tell you I am buying four more, one for each of my adult kids. As a serious cook, I have never found such a useful, even cooking pan especially with my smooth top stove."
1,Do not purchase...,"I have several Calphalon pots and pans that I've purchased over the years that have been just great. All of which were manufactured in Ohio.This pan became useless after three months of gentle care using only nylon utensils made for non-stick pans. The non-stick coating on this pan lived up to its name. It does not stick to the pan's cooking surface, but instead peels off in big flakes.This skillet, and two other Calphalon pans that I've purchased from Amazon in the last year were made in China, and are terrible as to quality, endurance, and finish. This skillet did a good job for a month or so, but then started slowly losing its non-stick surface.The other two pans received from Amazon were of such poor quality right out of the box that I returned them the same day for a refund. No such luck with this pan.The brand name Calphalon does not mean a quality product anymore if it was made in China."
5,"The must sturdy, versatile, aand easy to use pan ever","I bought this pan 5 or 6 years ago and it is by far the pan I use the most. Its surface is excellent non-stick and only needs a light spray of oil for any job. Makes perfect 2-egg omelets, 2-slice French toast, and grilled cheese sandwiches like a dream. I use it to saute baby asparagus with olive oil, crushed garlic and white pepper using a lid from another piece of cookware I have and it is amazing. Here's another tip: make the asparagus for dinner, and then cover the pan off-heat and unwashed, then make a 2-egg omelet using the seasoned pan the next morning. Fantastic.The pan has shallow sides and is heavier than the usual pan so don't try to use the pan to flip around the contents. I have had several people use the pan and they all loved it, and at this price ($35) it makes an excellent gift item!"
5,Awesome pan!,"This is such a versatile pan that I rarely use any of my other skillets anymore. I've had mine for a couple of years, but I just bought four more so that I'll have one of these for many years to come. It's a great size - substantial construction, but not so big and heavy that it's a pain to handle. I use it for everything - eggs, meats, grilled cheese, etc. The non-stick coating works very well and is quite durable. I'm retiring my first pan after two years of almost daily use, including frequent abuse by family members who don't comprehend that you shouldn't use metal utensils on non-stick. :) Great pan, unbeatable price. You'd easily pay $100+ for comparable skillets."
3,Non Stick,"I don't think it was non stick, had to get rid of it already. I know that I am tuff on pans, go threw a lot, but that is only because I really haven't found a non stick pan that will last a long time."
5,It works as described!,The sides are just the right height to get at the food with having them come outing looing like a bunch of Pick-up-sticks! It's definately better for my cholesterol. I've recently moved to the south and it is my opinion the they would die down here if it wasn't for salt and grease! This pan helps cut out the grease.
4,I LOVE this pan,"My husband hates it because it is not nonstick. But I love it. It is nice and heavy and spreads the heat well. I love to cook with butters and creams and it gives a nicer texture to the food. If I soak it, I don't have any trouble cleaning it. This is a pan that will last forever, no worries about scratches, and I can't imagine one that would work better."
5,Great Pan,"I use this pan alot and it is very sturdy and holds up well, I do not put it in the dishwasher though, I wash by and and let it air dry."
5,Very nice pan,"I think you can tell how a product going to turn out to be just by the feel of it. It's almost a perfect pan - nice weight, polished looks, and just about the right size. I have been using it for couple of weeks and so far it has been a pleasure. It is very easy to clean as well."
1,Buyer beware!,"After 1.5 yrs of light use and despite taking great care in hand washing the pan, the coating came off in flakes. The pan I got from amazon was made in China. I had other calphalon products and they are just fine."
5,highly satisfactory,"I cook for two most of the time and the commercial nonstick 10 inch griddle works to perfection. Pancakes, fried and scramble eggs cook just fine with no sticking whatsoever. This is done with low to medium heat. Calphalon makes great products at a reasonable cost."
3,could be better,"I bought this solely for the purpose of making pancakes and that was all i used it for. It was good in the beginning but after a couple of weeks, my food stuck in this pan. it was just pancakes and the bad part about food sticking in this is that it leaves this brown spots in the pan which just can't go away no matter how hard you try. I realized food tends to stick at those spots. Maybe it was my luck, i don't know but i wasn't happy with the pan.I gave this away and i bought a different brand."
1,Are these seconds?,This pan arrived in non retail packaging and had obvious scratches in the non stick surface. We sent it back. I'm wondering if Amazon's supply of these are actually factory seconds...
5,Fantastic Pan!,"I have had this pan for over 2 years & it is used at least 5 times a week to make crepes, fried eggs, omletes, grilled cheese, ect, ect ect and it still looks brand new! The pan is the perfect size for crepes & 3 egg omletes, not to small at all! We always allow the pan to cool and hand wash it, you should not put these in the dishwasher. I highly recommend this pan and have given 4 out as gifts."
5,"For the Price, GO FOR IT!","I've had this pan for a little over a year, and I must say it is Calphalon quality at a very low price. It's a perfect gift idea for the person who loves to cook but doesn't want to spend a ton on a cookware set. It cleans extremely well, cooks well, and looks and FEELS solid as can be.Great gift."
2,Doesn't stand the test of time.,I bought this pan several months ago and have used it quite often. It has worked pretty well but the now the nonstick has started to peel. I clean by hand ONLY and NEVER used a scouring pad. Just a sponge and a soft plastic bristle brush around the rivets where the handle attaches if need be. Great price but VERY limited durability.
4,Cooks great but a little fragile...,"This is the best pan for actually cooking eggs you'll find, but the surface is a little fragile. I had to replace mine in less than a year, and bought a spare in anticipation of having to do it again."
2,Mostly remakes with added crowd sounds,"If you're gonna mess with classic songs - try to make it sound like a concert - then why not try to find tracks that...don't fade?For the long-suffering Little Richard fans, who patiently wait for a new song to come out about every three years, and read about albums worth of unreleased recordings, here's another symbolic kick in the patootie. And not one uncommon cut!Gotta say, the big echo *does* work! Gives some rather flat-sounding tracks some real depth and impact. So, if you want to hear something *different* among all the strange sameness...well, the price is fair."
2,Not What I expected,I thought the projects might be something for real world use. This seems to me more a like a college textbook. Each project is just something else to do with the pic itself.
3,Wayyyyyyyyy to expensive!,"This is ONLY an AirSoft gun,But as you have heard before i could actually buy an actual REAL AK-47 assault rifle for much less(not that i would,but i could i could if i were 18 but i`m not yet).I don`t care how powerful the thing is its too EXPENSIVE!"
3,wat the heck wade,"who on earth this christmas is going to say ""i waznt a 900$ airsoft gun?? bill gates son? does this gun cure cancer? can it take you to the moon? if not why the &$&^# is it $900????????????????????????????"
2,Love At Last,"This book was ok. It was fast moving, that is how I was able to finish the book. Rochunda Lee did a good job with the writing but the story was a little out there."
3,Getting Lost While Meditating,"I'm not an expert on meditation techniques, but I do know that once while listening to this album I woke up 50 miles from my house with nothing to clothe me but a piece of chiffon, an interesting recipe for perogies tucked under my armpit, and absolutely no recollection of what had taken place. I was lead to believe by this product that being ""lost"" in meditation would entail no more than some deep thinking, and not many hours of unaccounted for experience and celtic tribal tattoos wrapped around my thighs."
5,music,I like the children's voices that make it easy for children to sing with the music.I like using it in my classroom.
2,Not for Internet/e-mail use,"Don't buy this if you plan to use it to send e-mail and view web clipping apps ""on the go,"" as Palm is advertising. You can't hook it up to a web unless you buy a special modem that still must be connected via landline, so, if you are used to DSL speed or wireless phones, it's pretty dumb. You can use it with a special kind of infrared mobile phone and mobile phone modem (Ericcson makes one), but that makes for an awfully lot of stuff to carry around all the time; besides, you can get a text-enabled phone for much cheaper than a Palm and send e-mail that way. I don't think they should be calling it ""internet ready"" on the box, when it's not at all. If you are near a landline phone, that usually means that you are near a computer.I'm disappointed with mine overall (can't you tell?). It seems like a glorified address book. I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe someone will come out with a cheap wireless modem for it, and then, it would be fine. But I would wait."
3,Less than expected....but does the job.,"The m505 is my first PDA. I actually researched all PDA's before making the purchase 5+ months ago and felt for the money and for what I would be using it for this would be the best choice. What I can say from my experience is it is a great organizer for addresses and numbers and a good choice for keeping important dates and scheduling in line.I don't care for the graffiti application and having to constantly backspace to correct mistakes. Also, it seems that you have to touch the screen 3-4 times with the stylis for it to recognize. I also don't care for the screen darkness (even with the lighted display) as it is hard to see even in decent light.I rate it a 3 overall. As prices of other color PDA's come down in the coming 12 months I will probably look to upgrade."
2,Disappointed,I did not research this one because I was happy with my previous palms. The screen in the ads has the night light lite so it appears to have backlighting which is does not. You have to have direct light to see the screen.You can use the light to make up for the darkness but it runs the battery down quick.To add to my sting. The m515 came out 3 weeks after I bought it.I will probably get a Clie or a Handspring the next time....
2,Color... very dissappointing,"I checked out the m505 in the store first. When I saw the color, it took about 5 seconds to purchase the m500. There is no comparison with the screen. The m500 is MUCH clearer than the m505. I needed a screen I could look at quickly, since I do so much with my Palm. I didn't have the time to turn on the backlight (which still isn't bright enough) and take a hard look at the simplist of text. The m500 is rated 5 stars, easy. The m505 is 2 stars. The screen means that much to me. This is why the active matrix screens on laptops are so much more popular than the dual-scans. They're worth the extra money. Palm needs to discontinue this or go back to the lab with this one."
3,color,"I bought a Palm m500 which is close to the 505.Advertised as being colored.Where's the color,if you're telling me the plate.This is not how I took it to be. I thought it meant like a color TV. What a disappointment,to think I paid more for that.Misrepresentation in my book.Could have gotten cheaper model that was colored.I was scare at first in the running of the pilot. But soon that disappeared. Simple in many ways."
1,Not really worth getting,"I've owned the m505 and I was disapointed by the backlight on the display being so dim. I use to use my Casio E125 as a flashlight (limited to 4-5 ft) in the dark. The software bundle is pale at best and the unit itself is too light (you cant tell if you have it with you or not). As far as the SD slot is concerned its a complete waste of time and palm should concentrate on the ""standard"" expandable slot on the bottom and making addons or sleeves for it."
2,Nice try,"The color screen on this is reflective -- meaning in direct sunlight it looks monochrome. Very dim in office light, or semi-darkness. So if you are using your PDA mostly indoors or want something comfortable to read go with the m500 as it is excellent in all lighting conditions.Big drawback: no contrast or brightness control, you are stuck with what PALM presets."
2,I'm Returning It!,I've been a long time palm enthusiast. Had a professional and then a Vx. The m505 has all the utility of the Palm Vx but the screen is horrible. I could barley see it without the backlight engaged. I'm returning it and going to upgrade to the IPAQ. I suggest you to the same...
3,"Its OK, really, but not a dream... I still love it","Once I owned a Psion 5mx Pro...now I own a Palm m505...now I'm happier than I was before.TRUE IS: not that great colorTRUE IS ALSO: great availability of softwareTRUE IS, ALL THE MORE: Palm = EASY TO USE (few window layers!!!)I work as a ""techie"" all day... don't need more techproblems!!! who does? Palm is NOT PERFECT, but the BEST CHOICE.KEY = USABILITY++ (but don't forget to SYNCH! you may lose data!)"
3,I like the Palm - But it doesn't do attachments,"I own the Palm IIIc. Recently I upgraded my mobile phone to an infrared model. When I connected my Palm (via the IR port) to my mobile phone to download my emails, I discovered that all emails with attachments were flagged as ""Attachment Omitted"". The reason, after a lenghty correspondence with Palm Inc, is that the Palm in it's current form does not support attachments of any kind.I am still sticking with my Palm and I refused to move across to the Pocket PC platform. But note: if you need the ability to download attachments with your email you will need to go with the Pocket PC. Forget about the Palm or Handspring products."
2,"Screen worse than IIIc, few SD cards available","This has been a good product, but was not worth the [money] I paid for it. The color screen was okay, but then a colleague showed me his IIIc screen, and then I was downright angry!! Palm blew it on the screen. It's very marginal. The options for the SD cards are few and far between. There are book titles--but who is going to read a book on any Palm? And, wireless connectivity has been VERY slow to come. Utilizing maps (e.g., RoadAtlas) is almost futile with the small, low-resolution screen. I would not recommend the 505 and would suggest the following alternatives: 1) save your money and just get a Palm V, 2) if email is big for you try the i705 (no color though--Palm must be scared!), or 3) get an Ipaq.The future is pretty clear. Palm stock is WAY down over this last year and Ipaqs are spreading fast. Palm had a good niche market, but Microsoft reigns supreme with software and Comaq has a core competency in electronics manufacturing. Palm has neither."
3,"Pretty good, however screen is a problem","Working in a computer store, I get to see every Palm Pilot type device that comes out. Before it hit the stores, I thought it was going to be the coolest thing ever, I thought about replacing my Palm Vx with it, but when I saw it, I was disapointed. The screen is color, but it is dull, it is hard to see without activating the sidelight to see it, which drains the battery. If you are looking for a color Palm device, look at the new Sony Clie, it may be...more, and thicker, but the screen is excellent, best screen I have ever seen on a Palm, but it also gives you an mp3 player (the Clie accepts memory sticks), and video/picture viewer. It is a Palm size and feel, with the great apps of a Pocket PC."
2,Expansion Card???,"I looked forward to using the expansion card to store large files such as many of the medical programs(e-pocrates,5emc,jhabx guide)I use. They wont run these programs,what a shame because these are the exact large files you would like to keep on an expansion card to free up your main memory. I tried two different SD cards without any success including the Palm brand SD card. I sent an e-mail to palm re this problem and recieved the following response ""databases or any other program that stores information can not be run on the palm expansion card"" I wonder what the good people at palm thought people would want to put on 16mb and greater expansion cards???? I took mine back and am currently exploring other products. I was a big palm fan but this product seem to have been poorly tested in a rush to get it on the market. BUYER BEWARE OF THE EXPANSION CARD THAT DOESN'T"
1,Is there a zero star rank? This PDA deserves it.,"Who was the (person)to decide on marketing a great product with potential for 65,000 color with such a dark display that kills all expectation? What a dumb idea. Looking at this screen long enough would give you only eye strain or disappointment; for me, I got both. I would return this one soon. Palm, Inc. needs to correct this issue fast..."
2,See how dim it is before you buy,"The color screen is indeed dim, compared to all other color PDAs on the market. Make sure you see one in action before you buy. Check out a friend's, or see the display section at CompUSA where you can try one out. Once I did that I cancelled my plans to buy an m505...."
1,Bad Product / Avoid!,"I loved my prior Palm units. The Professional, V, Vx - but the 505 has been a rotten product. The screen is dimm the hotsync USB funciton has failed on three of the units I have had, and I'm waiting for Palm to send me my replacement fourth unit. I would love to recomend Palm products, but it's not worth the trouble. Look at Sony or Handspring for better quality products."
5,Groucho,"I received this DVD in a reasonable time, it was a great addition to my Marx Brothers DVD collection."
4,A real gem for Groucho Marx fans.,"I had seen this title listed but could never get hold of it. When I finally did I was very pleasantly surprised. Groucho turns in a great comic performance, and Sinatra and Russell are very good also. A high point: Groucho & Frank sing a duet (""It's Only Dough"") while strolling down the avenue. A delightful find!"
5,The King And I,"Great movie, should have won the Best Picture award in 1956. Great acting by Brynner, Kerr, and Moreno. Yul won the Best Actor award in 1956. Great sets, costumes, et cetera, et cetera. A ""Must-See"" movie for all."
3,nice musical,my mom melane also wanted this movie.I guess she liked yul brynner and debra kerr.it takes me awhile to get used to it but it eventually grows on you
5,The King and I,"The King and I is a great movie. I always wanted to watch Yul Brynner is his stage play, but I was sad to hear that he passed away from cancer."
5,Great movie,"A classic movie for any collection. My grandchildren love the songs, but it doesn't hold the their attention for long as they are 5 and under."
3,incomplete movie,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie as it left out 3 songs from the original movie: My Lord and Master, Shall I Tell You What I think Of You?, and lastly, He is Wonderful.Two of these songs not only set a theme , but are very beautiful."
5,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, REMARKABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE , RELIABLE AND TIMELY DELIVERY","I NOT ONLY ORDERED THE KING AND I FOR XMAS DELIVERY, I ALSO ORDERED ""THE LION IN WINTER', SEVEN BRIDES FOR 7 BROTHERS, SOUTH PACIFIC, I CLAUDIUS, TERENCE TRENT DARBY etc.; THE WEEK BEFORE XMAS, ON DIFFERENT DAYS AND ALL WERE DELIVERED BEFORE XMAS AT A UNBELIEVABLE SAVINGS. I ONLY REGRET THAT I DIDN'T ORDER ""THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY THE VIII"" AND ""ELIZABETH R"" BEFORE THE $39.00 REDUCED PRICE EXPIRED! I APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS AND WILL CONTINUETO BE YOUR CUSTOMER.HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL!!"
5,I wish I could order more!,"I ordered two of these a couple of years ago and LOVE them! These mugs fit just right into the one-cup-at-a-time coffee dispensers at work and they hold a decent amount of coffee so you don't have to go for refills every ten minutes. Plus I get tons of compliments on this cup. A few times I've been stopped by people who've seen me put it in the microwave - they panic that it is actually enamelled tin it is made to resemble. I just smile and hit the ""start"" button."
4,A Scary Postwar Scenario,"This is a gripping adventure speculating on what might have been, or perhaps already is!What if Adolph Hitler had a son? What if he was spirited away as Berlin was falling? What if a powerful group of ex-Nazi officers was gathered in Argentina looking to resurrect the Third Reich? What if Hitler's son fell among these die-hards?The writing draws the reader into the story, but the mood is ambiguous. Do we want the boy to survive to manhood or be put away as U.S. intellicence officers prefer?Strong character delevelopment and well-documented, this is a worthwhile book for any interested in the end of World War II and its aftermath. The feeling of the expatriot Nazi community in South America seems particularly realistic.My only criticism is that I found the ending hard to swallow. Others, however, may find it inevitable. But this makes for a well-told tale that is worth mulling over."
3,Where's the beef?,"I've read the entire Gallup series of strengths books hoping to learn the secret--What characteristics should we look for when hiring?These books keep tantalizing us with references to the many studies Gallup has done for large corporations to help them hire more successfully. But nowhere do they give us the real meat of these studies. Instead they dance around it and make us wonder why we just spent our valuable time and money reading a couched advertisement for their services.Nevertheless, the 12 good management points (Q12) do offer an excellent reference tool for a manager who wants to provide improved employee morale and productivity.Please, Gallup, give us the ""12 points"" for hiring various positions in organizations. Don't keep it a secret."
4,Builds Off Strengthfinder,"If you are familiar with Strengthsfinder and you need to develop a sales force or, to a lesser degree, your own personal sales techniques, then this is a good purchase. On the otherhand, the other books are not a pre-req. There is enough intro to Strengthsfinder concepts reading the previous works that this book can give someone the basics if a sales focus is the only goal. I consider Strengthsfinder so valuable, that I'm glad to have read both."
4,"Not Pink Floyd, but it doesn't need to be.","If you are looking for some more Pink Floyd music on this album you may be disappointed, but not entirely. There are definitely moments on 'Wet Dream' when you will hear that classic Pink Floyd sound from the great 70's albums because Wright contributed to some of their great songs and most memorable moments. Once you get past judging this as a Pink Floyd album you may be pleasantly surprised to find that it is a solid album in it's own right. Wright enlists A list musicians to record this and their talent is obvious. The album has a relaxed, jazzy, sound to it. The songs seem to be of a personal nature, and there is a gentleness to them. Some of the songs do sound similar but overall the album plays well and shows that Wright was definitely a talent on his own."
4,"Rick ""Dreamy"" Wright","I quite like this album. I realize that it is not an earth-shattering production or meant to be catchy or intense like Floyd, but I think that was the point. It's for chilling out. I like the melancholy mood and jazz-infused sounds and think the guitar fits in well with the overall vibe on the album.I can definitely hear some of the Floyd in here. In terms of mood and time structure, this feels like a long lost cousin of 'Obscured by Clouds' or 'Meddle'.The instrumental numbers are the best. Unfortunately, Rick's solo vocals (those un-layered and/or without a back-up singer) do not stand up very well. They sound forced and flat. And Rick's vocals here on 'Wet Dream' are better than they are on 'Broken China'. If the vocals were better, I would give it 5 stars.I don't think this is a 5-star album, but it's a decent effort and a nice album to relax to on a lazy afternoon."
5,GREAT RICHARD WRIGHT CD,A GREAT CD FROM RICHARD WRIGHT THE TALENTED KEYBOARDIST OF PINK FLOYD THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING CLASSICS LIKE SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.FIVE STARS.
2,Rick Wright - Wet Dream,"Length:: 0:56 MinsThis is such an uninteresting album. I've listened to it several times, and can't imagine listening to more than 2-3 songs againIts not a BAD album, per se. The guitar work by Snowy White is fine, the singing alright. But it doesn't really grab you, and it really is rather a bland recordBroken China might be a better place to start with regard to Ricks solo stuff. He also contributes very nice keyboard work to Syd's solo stuff (his 2nd album Barrett)""Mad Yannis Dance"" and ""Drop in from the Top"" are good, but what we have is a REALLY dull album from start to finish"
3,Not the Best DVD for Corrs,"The muscial performances by The Corrs on this DVD of the Royal Albert Hall concert are certainly good. The real problem with this DVD is that filming was obviously an after-thought. Like many of the Royal Albert Hall concerts on DVD, the filming his pretty cold and removed. The staging of the performance is also uninspired.If you want a Corrs DVD, get the ""Unplugged"" DVD. Unlike this one, that concert was built with filming in mind. The music is great and it is fun to watch. The shots are intimate and make you feel like you are sitting in the front row. Unplugged is worth every penny. Live at Royal Albert Hall really isn't for the casual Corrs fan at all - only collectors."
2,I agree - boring!,"I agree with the reviewer who said it was boring. Sure the girls are pretty, but cutesy only gets you so far. The coloring of the whole DVD is blue/grey, the vocals are so so, musicianship only passable and the songs forgetabble. The sound is not 5.1 and the format is only 4:3. Their stage presence is almost non existent. For some reason the crowd is 40ish and very subdued (might be the performance?). I don't get why so many rate this high here and on Netflix. It's not bad but certainly not up to the production value and musicianship of The Eagles, Santana or Michael Buble. Get those instead if you want to see great performances."
4,Chase,"It's amazing. Nearly thirty years have passed since I last heard this material.Unfortunately, mainstream radio wasn't exactly ready for this fast-paced fusion of rock and jazz, and its airplay in the early 1970's was minimal.Since I first heard Chase, I have acquired formal education in music, and paid my dues as a player as well. As my taste in music became more refined, my appreciation for Chase never changed, and I was delighted to find this ""album on CD"" recently.Three decades later, I played it, and got shivers up my spine.It takes something special to have me stand up and publicize my opinion of recorded music, and this album has done that for me.Chase lives on.D Truscott"
2,NOTHING CLOSE TO MAYNARD!,"IF YOU LIKE GOOD TRUMPET PLAYERS AND ARE IMPRESSED BY ONES THAT CAN GO HIGH, LOOK AT MAYNARD FERGUSON. CHASE ISNT ANYTHING COMPARED. HE'S A GOOD TRUMPET PLAYER BUT IT'S ROCK AND ROLL AND NOT JAZZ. AND HE CANT GO VERY HIGH AT ALL!"
1,poor quality,"The table was poorly made, wood was patched with wood filler. Overall POOR Quality they should be ashamed...A. Magno MD"
3,Poor Packaging,"The table is beautiful. However, the package it came in was far too weak for such a heavy object so it was starting to fall apart. Moreover, the hardware package came apart during shipping, sending the parts all over the carton. Some fell out, while others lodged into the table, damaging it with deep ruts."
4,King's X's Ty Tabor- A Different slice of Rock.,Recently picked up this CD in trying to complete my King's X side projects CD's. Without Dug's bass- less funky but still great melodic rock with excellent guitar work by Ty. Actually 4.5 stars.
4,Very good!,Northanger abbey is a charming book. Jane Austen draw a picture for the reader of the world as the way he are. This book is very good and i have nothing else to say but this.
4,"Lacking, but not terrible.","This is a parody of the Gothic literature, that was so popular at the time this book was written. One almost wonders how it ever got published. Given the style it was constructed in, being humorous, this book is very odd. Some parts I couldn't really understand, but other than that, fun story with no vampires - YAY!!! I always found the altering of classic literature to be rather horrid."
3,Not consistently interesting,"Though it started off with charm and piqued my interest, I raced to finish this book. However, on the whole, I found _Northanger Abbey_ to be a dull story, since it's an obvious imitation of more interesting gothic novels, such as Ann Radcliffe's _The Mysteries of Udolpho_ and _The Italian_, which I also just read.From an intellectual standpoint, I'd read this book again, and recommend it on that basis(probably because I read it for a course). But if you want a good and consistent gothic tale with an ending as strong as the introduction, turn to Radcliffe for starters. Austen's book will give you other references worthy of checking out.Three-and-a-half stars."
4,very good,"I am making my way through all of Austen's book, and thiswas the third after Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.This was the first of her novels and the last one to be published.However, her writing is most of the time almost as sharp as inthe later novels, and the plot will also not be too much of asurprise. The novel is, however, not at the level of the previuslymentioned two, perhaps mainly because the heroine is somewhatdim, although likeable. The conversations between Mr. Darcyand Mrs. Bennet are those of equals. However, it is sometimespainfully obvious in the exchanges between Henry and Katherinethat it is Henry who is the intelectually superior. Although theplot rambles a bit here and there, this is still a very good read,and Austen's wit shines through on a number of occasions."
3,The Great Gatsby,"There were some highlighting in it and underlining, but over all it was in good condition."
4,Beautifully written..,"I enjoyed this book. The descriptions were lovely and rich, and Fitzgerald really captured life and put it in this book. It is about a midwesterner named Nick who goes to New York and meets several characters including the rich nextdoor neighbor Jay Gatsby. It then shows the progression of all of these people's relationships until the climax of the book.My only gripe would be that the characters are quite unlikeable. You can't relate to them. You can't sympathize with them. It's not that they're thinly drawn. They're not flat and two dimensional. One simply has to dislike all of these characters, though! The book would be perfect if I could at least have one character to hang on to, so to speak. Maybe see myself in. Despite that I still have to say it was an exceptional book."
4,The Great Gatsby reviewed by stvm student,"The Great Gatsby is a story about the Jazz age, it tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a materialistic bootleggar who was blinded by his love. It is told from the view point of Gatsby's friend Nick Calloway, who sees the corruption of the rich through his western values. Nick discovers Gatsby's true attributes through many long nihgts and odd expeinces that could only of happened during the ""Roaring Twenties."" This book shows the materialism that existed in the upper class during the 1920's, it is a great read that helps to understand how consumerism and materlism came to be."
4,The Phenomenal Great Gatsby,"Through a story of passion, desire for materialistic possessions, and deceitful lifestyles, ""The Great Gatsby"" has captured the essence of society. Gatsby lived an extravegent life in hopes of winning Daisy's love. To Gatsby's demise a life of love does not hold a candle to a life of possessions. I loved this book due to its wonderful story line and it revealed the true life and society of the 1920's. It also made me think of what life is really about and how important succcess really is."
4,A well-developed story in so few words.,I had read very few classics before readinf Fitzgerald's Graet Gatsby. He portrays each character very well. He gets his point across without boring the reader with every miniscule detail. It is a masterpiece. No wonder it is number 3 on the Top 100 novels of the century!
2,Overrated...,"I decided that I needed to finally read this ""classic"" and what a disappointment...The novel isn't written all that well (despite the comments to the contrary) and is filled with non-sequiters (not in a good, fragmented Dos Passos way), jumbled fill-in-the-gap flashbacks, and poor prose. Additionally, the novel suffers from an extremely contrived plot and climax. I'm sure at one point in the history of American Literature this could have been seen as a clever and biting indictment of the upper crust of society, but reading it in 2007 exposes it as only another variety of the boring 19th century society fiction in the same vein as Austen, Bronte, etc."
4,Review from Theamwriter,"The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite classics. I read this when I was high school, but didn't get my own copy of the book until later years. I thought it was an interesting read. To read about the main character and how it was possible to redefine or recreate yourself and try to persuade the world around you to accept this new definition was amazing to read. Then to mix in a love story with Jay Gatsby and his love for Ms. Daisy Buchanan was a good read as well. Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to read a good book and a classic."
2,Overrated classic good for nothing more than '20's spirit,"I was intially enthusiastic that I had found time to read the ""great American novel"" and the definitive work of the 20th century, Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"". Much to my disappointment I found nothing more than an a superficial plot based mostly on descriptions of the 1920's. Fitzgerald succesfully caught the spirit of the 20's so if you're looking to get a feel for that era this would be a good book to read, on the other hand if you're looking for a grand literary work, there is a lot more out there. Fitzgerald's characters are shallow and unidentifiable, his plot weak and slow-moving to an extent which becomes tiresome even though the book is relatively short. Fitzgerald is not an author but rather a social historian, something apparent in other of his works, such as ""Bernice bobs her hair"". So if it's insight on the 20's you want, this should be great, but it falls short of anything else it's reputation demands."
3,No. 2 novel complete,"I finished the No. 2 novel in a much shorter time than I finished the No. 1 novel (Ulysses). The Great Gatsby was a very short and readable novel, that didn't confuse your mind with incomprehensible jumble of psychedelic words pasted together to make a nice literary mosaic (still hammering on Ulysses). The Great Gatsby provided a nice window for looking at the pre-depression era of the 1920s lifestyle on the east coast, and also portrayed a vibrant narrative of a love-stricken psychotic fool within all of us given the right circumstances. The culmination of related events at the end is well worth the minimal effort required to read this book. Because it was such a short novel, I would recommend it for light reading, but would not rate it No. 2 all time."
3,Hard to follow but good....,"While reading this book, I felt that it was very hard to follow. And it wasn't so much the actual story, but the dialect of the characters. But once you overcome that, the story gets very interesting. I suggest reading this book if you like tragic stories. It has an unhappy ending but it makes you keep thinking."
3,I lost fifty pounds reading this book!,"I've tried every diet in the book(s.) But Mr. Fitzgerald has hit upon th perfect balance of low-carb dining and exercise. His insights into plums are unparallelled. Thank you Fitzy, you truly are a ""great"" gatsby."
4,Wonderful Symbolism,"Dear reader, do not read ""The Great Gatsby"" like you would other books. In fact, before you read it (or re-read it), take a thing such as time, color, etc. and see how Fitzgerald uses that thing. You will be amazed how this book dives deep into many dimensions of thought and spirit. Wonderful book!"
3,American Classic,The book is a very quick read. The author writes very well and his ideas flow nicely and organized. After reading the novel you realize there is a little Gatsby in all of us! Overall good read.
4,"A Great Read project for Wilmington, NC","I read this book in college but picked it up again because I wanted to take part in the ""great read"" project here in Wilmington.I enjoyed reading this book again for the vivid picture it creates of the roaring 20's and of the people who populate this story. F. Scott was a true master of the written word."
5,Great Gatsby - always the great American novel,"I loved The Great Gatsby when I first read it in high school English class, and I still love it today. I reread it about once a year, and I never fail to be impressed by F. Scott Fitzgerald's use of language. Quotes like this - ""Can't repeat the past?"" he cried incredulously. ""Why of course you can!"" - are just classic.The Great Gatsby is a story abut Jay Gatsby's quest to track down the girl he loved in his youth, and his inability to come to grips with the path her life has taken in the interim. It also follows narrator Nick Carroway, Gatsby's neighbor for a summer. But most of all it is a story about the American dream - about love, money and ambition - and a slice of life in the 1920s, full of wild parties and glamour and tradgedy."
3,The American Dream,The Great Gatsby is the classic novel known as the American Dream. I thought that in some ways it represented what everyone in the United States wants. I thought that in the beginning it was really really boring but in the secone half of the book it became a little bit more interesting. I think that overall it was an okay book but I don't think that I would ever read it again.
4,The Life without Love.,"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book, I dont see the need for highschool students to be reading this. Personally, I dont believe that they have the mind for it. He or she is not mature enough to understand the value of this book. They dont see the agony Gatsby goes through. The lust he has for Daisy and wanting her more than every material object on this earth. He puts this girl in his mind and he cant get her out. EVen though he is well aware she is with another guy, that she may or may not truely love. Either way he wants her but cant get her and he feels his life is not complete without her. So many adults do that today, teens dont understand, their idea of ""love"" is spelt with l-u-v. They just dont get it. If you are in highschool, your gonna hate it, read it when you have grown up. And if you are a teacher dont force these kids to read this, it will be worthless and they will probably never pick it up again dont ruin this for them!"
1,Oh I'm so rich. Oh my friends are so rich.,"Man, what self-indulgent rubbish.""I am so rich...I am so observant...My friends are so rich...My friends have great parties...Gatsby is so rich...Gatsby is so neat...""So it's a great story about the Jazz era. It wasn't that great an era.If I wanted to read about lame, rich, full of themself people going to parties, I'd pick up People magazine.A bore."
1,Un American,"One of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, codswallop. This is nothing more than a romantic tale of Fitzgerals's longing to be one of the moneyed aristocracy, some of those people who had been around for a while. Was he happy to have talent and wealth? No, he wanted to be up there on the hill with the rich. What a cop out.Scott Fitzgeralds said to Ernest Hemingway ""the rich, you know they are different to you and I"" Ernie replied ""yes they've got more money"" and I reckon just for once that old braggart Ernie had hit the nail on the head.So what does Fiztgerald do, he has his hero Gatsby mysteriously get some money but no that is not enough because he is not part of society and he can only look at his long lost loves window over the water. It's the dilemma of the untouchable in India the Commoner in England buts its nonsense. Its not American its just because Scott was a whoos. This is not literature its Mills and Boon.You know in your heart I'm right"
3,Price,"I am very upset that this is such a classic, yet it is $10 on the Kindle... It's more than even the hardback book. I was told classics were supposed to be free; clearly not."
4,Haunting and Wonderul,"I'm actually reading this book as a sophomore, a year before I'm required to. I enjoy reading and I usually don't like books like this but in preparation to see the movie I decided to read the book beforehand. This book is simply amazing, a haunting message about a man who has everything but is not content, and a women who is only content with having everything."
2,The Not So Great Gatsby,"I was pretty disappointed. Couldn't read the book because it was missing the first 6 pages. I know I bought a Used book, but this was not ""Acceptable."""
5,Don't you people get it?....,"DUH, so many of the characters were shallow, that's the POINT! Nick becomes, well, disillusioned with the 'glamorous' life Daisy and Tom are leading, he realizes how shallow and corrupt they are. Gatsby isn't dull, he's a fascinating character study. Don't you see how he's trying to recreate the past, but can't? Even Daisy is full of symbolism- like the name. A daisy is white and pure looking, but on the inside (like Daisy) it is yellow- which stands for sickliness, corruption, etc. This is also a beautifully written book."
3,Surprising,I was not prepared for the turn the book takes and was left feeling perplexed. This is a book I was required to read in high school and did not at the time. I will need to spend some time now digesting the meaning behind the seemingly meaninglessness in the story. An engaging read but a challenging story.
4,"nice, thanks. will deal with him again.","nice, thanks. will deal with him again.nice, thanks. will deal with him again.nice, thanks. will deal with him again."
2,Not aware size is TINY,"The book is a little pocket edition, not a full size book with the original art on the cover as I thought."
4,An american classic,"Gatsby has achieved legendary status in the American canon because it plumbs perpetually attractive themes: unbridled ambition, wealth, power and their inevitable diminution in the face of the most powerful human reality of all-that these are like springtime blooms, satisfying, evanescent and ultimatley to no purpose. For that alone the book is worth reading time and again, ironically rather like the Bible."
5,A wonderful read.,"This book is a great classic and doesn't need another review, but regarless I felt I needed to add my word.I just finished this book and it is the first time I have read it. It is a beautifully created peace of work. Not just the story but his marvelous and brilliant chose of words and sentences. Some of his sentence are simple genious.I read when he created this Book he wanted it to be a piece of art. It is just that.The story leaves you with an unforgettable memory. It is as all great books are, moving. A great read for anyone who loves to read and for writers, it is a must. It will improve your writing.Author, DK."
3,An excellent story. A must read.,"The Great Gatsby, by Fitzgerald, Is a wonderful story. Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop."
2,Online Publisher-low quality,"I was surprised to find that this book was missing the copyright/publishing information usually found on the first page. I looked on Amazon and determined (after I had already received the book) that it was printed-to-order by Lulu publishing, an online single-copy book publisher. There printing was low quality: there were no page numbers, the font was too small (maybe a 9 or 10 pt.) and it has weird formatting. None of this actually prevented me from reading the book. I just finished it and enjoyed the writing style and story. But, the printing style was just annoying. I will be more careful in the future, when buying paperbacks from Amazon, to only buy from reputable publishers."
4,I think this would be a great book if I read it once more.,"I think this is a good book but yet, a little confusing and hard to understand. I sort of understood it but I didn't for the most part. But I think this would have been a grrrreat book only if I had understood it better."
2,Couldn't get it,"This is my first review, extremely trite, admittedly, but about 100 pages into it, I couldn't see the point to this book. I finally gave up. Maybe I was looking for too much meaning into it. I know this is a classic, but it just didn't resonate with me."
2,"""The greatest American novel ever written...""","Yeah right.I know this is a ""classic"" and a required read for any person not spending their life under a rock but quite frankly, its terribly overrated.This tale of the ""American Dream"" is really nothing more than people who will do anything they can to get rich.It's a tale of snobby people during the jazz age and all their affairs and problems.Just because a book is consideed a classic doesn't make it good.I'm very sorry if I have offeneded anyone who read and enjoyed this book but I don't see what the big deal is.A waste of time and money, please don't read this unless your one of those old people who never smile and drink little cups of tea with their pinky sticking out.In the words of the mighty Dennis Miller ""That's just my opinion, I could be wrong..."" But I'm not."
4,What Can I Add?,"This book has over 1000 reviews. There is, essentially, nothing that I can say that has not already been said.The novel is nice, well-written, and an enjoyable read. The characters are all plausible, believable, and entertaining. They are all three-dimensional, and none of them are useless. The book is extremely well-written, and I would recommend it to just about anyone. I wouldn't call it flawless, though.Perhaps because of the hype, perhaps because it lacks some sort of jenais se quas, I can't quite bring myself to give this book five stars.B+Harkius"
5,face it; Gatsby is the best,"If Catcher in the Rye is not the world's best book, thenthe Great Gatsby is. Maybe it is anyway."
4,very rich book,"The Great Gatsby is an highly enjoyable, very rich book. Although the story will not be easy at all times, it is still lyrically and powerfully written. Fitzgerald is at height of his powers in this novel and creates characters that resonate far beyond the page."
2,vacuous,"not sure what or which is the more / most vacuous . . . the characters, the style, the plot or the writer himself. save yourself some time and watch ants crawl around or contemplate the ceiling fan. Overwrought, overwritten. At some point, you gotta care about the author or the events or at least one of the characters, for God's sake. This stuff is dated today and I think at the time it was trite and tripe, both. Like the Emperor's New Clothes, someone ought to speak the truth about this boring piece which is, most decidedly, not a great work of art."
1,Just don't go there!,"Excellent substitute for valium... The most artificially inflated phenomenon since the 1929 stock market, and likewise this book seems like a worthy instigator of a great depression."
4,I suppose it's great,"Life in the 1920s. although it may seem wonderful, was unfulfilling. In the Great Gatsby, follow Nick Carraway and discover the dramatic stories of great and not so great individuals. No book ever has shown you such a reality of twenties life behind the limelight.This book was in my mind worth reading the 200 some odd pages. This story is not a happy happy book that many books are and chooses the reality approach. This book is definatley worth the hour it takes to read. ..."
2,Singularly centered,"The whole story appears to revolve around this huge ""love triangle"" of Gatsby trying to get Daisy to come back to him and leave Tom. Upon close scrutiny of Gatsby's actions it would appear that they all are leading up to how he could meet Daisy again. The main theme of the story."
3,Entitlement,I wish I were reading this for a class instead of for pleasure. There are many parallels between then and current individuals of the same class that I would have enjoyed discussing with others. Fitzgerald definitely had an axe to grind.
4,"Good Book, Beautifully Written","The book wasn't the best I've ever read, but I did enjoy F. Scott Fitzgerald's style of writting. It's the subtility and symbolisim that make this book a worthwhile read. Though, I felt it was slow and prodding at points, which may turn some people off."
5,"Gatsby, even greatest","The books included in the Cambridge edition of the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald are expensive, but they're surely worth every cent of it. In fact, they're are the best ones I`ve ever read.In this edition of the old Gatsby, for instance, you""ll find a rich amount of explanatory notes, illustrations and editorial apparatus -- all suitable for a deeper scholarly reading of a classic masterpiece.I don't see how anybody could make a better edition than this one, because it allows you, like no other one, to see how the author developed the book and the characters. (There's even an early draft of one of the main passages in the book -- the confrontation between Gastby and Tom at the Plaza Hotel.)The result will be even better if you also read another volume in the Cambridge edition: ""Trimalchio"", which is an early version of Gastby. If you're a Fitzgerald buff, don't miss it, old sport."
4,GREAT BOOK,This book is one of the most lively short stories I've picked up. Fitzgerald did an excellent job of putting life into these characters and the setting they are placed in. It really gives the reader an idea on how New York living was like back in the early 1920's.
2,Great?,"I read this for book club. I can't believe it's a classic...I thought the characters boring, unsympathetic and one-dimensional. It gave a fair description of what I imagine the era was like."
1,"Not so ""Great""","Hey everyone! Lookit me! I'm a rich little snot and I can throw a big party in my mansion! What's ""great"" about this Gabsty fellow exactly? Write something about people who work for a living, not this junk.I didn't like this one little bit, sorry. Try again. Only one star for your book, sir!"
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring!
1,great bore,"I really tried to get into this book. Sorry, I could not get past the shallow, dislikeable people and situations. Prose and symbolism are nothing if accompanied by a boring, unreadable plot. Maybe that is the point, but there are plenty of classic books that have it all: prose, symbolism, good plot, good characterizations, action, social commentary etc. It seemed like this book was an outline of a novel where the author sketched the main points, threw in some symbolism, then decided not to fill in the outline and create any depth to the story. Maybe that was the point, but it made the book really lacking. It does not require a thin, shallow book to portray thin, shallow people or times."
3,It's Only My Opinion,"To me, this book was a little on the dull side. The life of Jay Gatsby was less than fascinating and his obsession with Daisy Buchanan was pathetic. This doesn't mean that the book isn't well-written or that it isn't a ""classic""- that's why I give it three stars. Its slow moving plot and lack of action is the reason why I only give it three stars."
1,Yawn,"Can mucisians loose their talent overnight? Haujobb did. And not only did they do justthat, but the singing is getting worse and worse. Compared to the previous releases from Haujobb, this album is plain boring!"
1,Is this their first demotape,"The only thing I can ask myself, is whether this is their first demotape or just a plain mistake. Whos singing? I just spend my money on a practical joke here?"
5,Your Ears Will Never Be The Same!,"Intelligent Industrial has never been done better than these guys right here. The complexity, wierd sounds, and Daniel Myer's attracting voice will make this album you're new audiotory drug. I never ever have or will get bored of this album. Its on my top 5s! You won't regret it spend every penny on it, its worth more than the price shown above."
4,A Nice Sequel,"Rowan and the Travelers is a very good book, considering that sequels are never as good as the original. I enjoyed this book very much when I read it. It is especially good for readers around the age of ten that enjoy adventure, fantasy, and immagination. When the travelers, or the Indians, of the land come to visit Rin, Rowan is intrigues by their mystical ways. But upon hearing an ancient legend, he embarks on an adventure through a dangerous cave with his new friend, Zeal.Very nice, though not quite as good as the previous."
1,"It sucked, big time!","It sucked hard. Not the worst movie I've ever subjected my self toBut it's up there. I would give it away to people I don't like.It was so bad I don't want my money back.It was painful, I want to slit my wrist.Helmut"
4,Marvelous,A very good movie and a classic soundtract by vangelis about columbus discovering america. Made to celebrate the 500 years when columbus came to america. A classic if you take the violence out. Beatiful location and acting.
2,It just keeps on going!,"I was required to watch this movie for school, and I have to say it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Along with detailing Columbus's first trip to the New World, they feel the need to show his second trip as well which takes up a good hour and a half. It is very hard to follow at some points and I found 4-5 places during the movie where it could've ended right then and there. As a whole, this movie could have been made much better and a lot easier to follow!"
4,Action and Drama Work Hand-in-Hand,"This film, like many others, shows why Daniel Day-Lewis is a master of his trade. I had no problem suspending disbelief that he was truly a boxer. This was even evident during the opening credits when he was shadow boxing in the prison yard. But this wasn't a movie about boxing; it's a movie about the love between two people that endured a decade and a half apart. I don't know anything about cameras and the types of film used to shoot movies, but the actual look of the film was perfect for a torn up Northern Ireland. It also captures the changing mind-set from extreme to cooperative by those resisting change when they realize that extremism will never lead to a favorable conclusion. So there's a couple different themes, all tied together to make a good movie. On a sidenote - I literally had to buy this movie because I could not find it in a video rental store anywhere ... does anyone know why?"
4,disappointed,"Even though I love the idea behind this toy, I feel they should have worked harder on having the pieces stay interconnected. The first few times my child created something, it would fall apart easily. He could not hold it up to ""show"" us what he did."
2,Covertec SX47/03 Leather Case for Treo 600&650,"This product is not good for day to day use. The magnet does not secure the Treo enough for me. If you are in a car with the seat belt on, the magnet releases the Treo into and under the seat everytime. A redesign is in order for this product. I love the look, but not at the cost of dropping or losing my beloved Treo."
4,One of the most disturbing movies of 1996,"Ewan McGregor delivers an admirable performance in one of the most haunting, disturbing, and terribly hilarious movies of 1996. It's all really, really intense, and its playful directness is absolutely fascinating."
5,AmazinG,"If you are a cult follower of this film, this is a good addition to your collection. Great features and good quality."
3,My Review...,"First off, what was the big deal about this film? What was so special that it got Two Thumbs Up? This film is about a pair of junkies mainly Renton played great by Ewan Macregor who just wants a hit. The film is not a dark comedy with only a few short moments being funny.Yes I know it was supposed to be a drama. It was a real let down to me atleast. I had heard alot about the film, I was hoping for a great one but I was mistold.I guess you could say this is just your average junkie film. The writers want to make you feel sorry for them, but it just does not happen. The acting was well, Sick Boy was a great character and the rest were fairly good.If you must see this film, do not get your hopes up. After a few months I will watch the film again and see if my views have changed either way. SorryHave a Nice LiFE!Ryan"
2,Way too many 5 star reviews here,"There are 2 to 3 moments of humor in this film and 2 to 3 moments of brutal reality. Otherwise, it's far too disjointed and muddled to rate any higher than two stars. Basically shows the depressing and pathetic lives of severe heroin addicts and how difficult it is to quit using. Unless you've been living under a rock, you essentially know heroin is dangerous, addicting, and difficult to quit. No new material here folks. ""Traffic"" has nailed this plague far better."
1,if you think junkies are glamorus,"I just couldn't believe the hype this movie got when it came out. I had trouble trying to follow the conversations (they were spoken in a very thick Sort of Scotch accent). The people were sooooooo ugly. What happened to all the beautiful movie stars????????????? The men were ugly and the women were even uglier if that's possible. These people where obviously extreme low end people. Unless you like junkies, baby death and ugly people pooping in their beds don't bother with this. Rent ""The Full Monty"" instead! It was a much better movie."
2,Scots Punks on Parade,"Another glossily realized finally trite/empty celebration of life without ideas, intelligence, foolish hobbies like learning or responsibility. The celebration is stylistic rather than substantial. TRAINSPOTTING is even-handed enough, underneath, but sensational on its surface, which is as far as the typical sophomoric hipster dude/dudette ever bothers to penetrate. Detached. Not even close to harrowing enough. Commercial trash?"
2,"Hilarious Film, BAD DVD - NON-ANAMORPHIC TRANSFER","I REFUSE TO BUY DVD'S THAT USE LETTERBOXED WIDESCREEN. STUDIOS NEED TO GET A CLUE. THAT MAKES SIX DVD'S I CAN'T BUY BECAUSE THEY WON'T PRESENT CORRECTLY ON MY TV. I HAVE A 30 INCH 16:9 TV. WHY WOULD I WANT TO WATCH AN 18"" IMAGE LETTERBOXED WITHIN ""NORMAL MODE"" IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN?!"
4,"""One Fish, Two Fish, Red...""","I have heard it stated that there is a very thin line between genius and insanity. Arlene the Sardine is very close to this line in dealing with the issue of death. Those who are scared of the potential of suicide might be very frightened by this book and would rate it low accordingly. The book, about a young fish who wants to become a sardine deals with death in an exceptionally playful manner... so playful that some could consider it macabre. This is a book one will either love or hate. Though, I was somewhat disturbed by the book... I believe that the book is exceedingly well done, with beautiful illustrations, and a playful narrative. It seemed reminiscent of the fairy tales of old... which were far more dark than today's Disney versions. It is a book definitely worth checkig out from your local library.Crazy James"
5,"Brilliant, hilarious, stop reading so much into it","Have to say, as a librarian and parent of 2 young children, I found this book to be an absolute joy. I actually laughed so hard I cried the first time I read it to my son. It's absurd, it's challenging, it's brilliant."
1,You've GOT to be kidding!,"I have yet to meet a child who has actually seen a sardine, much less eaten one. This book, from concept to execution, is one of the worst examples of the picture book format I have ever seen, and, being a librarian, I've seen plenty. Despite what other reviewers have written, most children will not find humor or comfort in the story and will not be ""uplifted"" by the illustrations. Kids are ""uplifted"" by COWS IN THE KITCHEN or DOUBLE TROUBLE IN WALLA WALLA, not by the death of a fish. The book is dark, ugly and pretty much a waste of a tree."
1,The Worst Children's Book I've Ever Read,"Arlene was a fish who wanted to be a sardine. After being caught in a net, Arlene was pulled onboard and there she died. Really, it says that. It's not that I don't want my kid to know about death, but to teach her that animals want to die for her, that becoming a canned good is a great goal, was strange and bizarre. The only good thing about it was the huge laugh we had when I showed it to other adults. Maybe I next they'll publish a book about a girl with ""magic cigarettes"" or something just as bizarrely creepy!"
4,Well worth it for the price,"I bought these as a gift for my brother and even though they are priced on the cheap end, they are built more sturdily than many other more expensive pedals"
5,great cami,"these are the best cami's ever. i got a white,brown ,tan and black; they are long enough. very comfortable also"
1,HORRIBLE TANK TOP I HAVE EVER OWNED,I hated this tank top! I bought several different colors and the material is awful. It is like nylon and lint gets stuck all over it! I normally buy camis to layer my clothes and won't buy this ever again.
5,Great LONG Cami!,"Things i like:1. I love how LONG this cami is! Right now I can pull it down over part of my bottom.2. The neckline is perfect for me. I'm in my 4th month and coverage is good. I don't know how it will be later on in the pregnancy, but it works for now.3. It seems to have enough stretch for me to grow into. If this changes, I will update my review.Things I don't like:I can't think of anything!"
4,Thhe expansion of New england,"Great to have reasonable priced access to these early history texts. How about "" History of Phelps Gorham Purchase"" by same publisher. Constantly out of stock."
3,DVD feedback,"Delvery on this was great however i was unaware not all DVD's play on all dvd players, as a result I am unable to veiw this DVD on my player I appently need a no.4 region for Australia."
2,Sixth Season Disappointment,Weeds has gone downhill with season six. Plot holes galore and boring storylines. The banter and dynamic between Andy and Nancy have become uninteresting and lame. Nancy does so many stupid things that she's getting on my nerves and failing to intrigue me.
4,Nice addition to any home mechanic's tool collection,"This socket set is solid and well built for it's price. I got this in order to replace brake pads on my BMW, which required a 7 mm Allen hex and it worked like a charm.I think that the quality and durability is at least comparable if not superior to a similar 13 piece metric hex allen socket set by Craftsman (at almost twice the price and without a storage case). The storage case as well as each socket has well marked engraved labels (e.g. H2, H3, etc) so finding the right size is a snap. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of their selection of sizes, omitting the 11 and 13 mm hex allen sockets, instead jumping from 10 to 12 and then 14 mm. I am planning to purchase another set of larger hex allen sockets in the future and will probably have to overlap the sets to go from 11 to 19 mm instead of from 13 to 19 mm but this is only because I like to have all sizes on hand for any contingencies."
4,BOCA rocks again,"Collegiate a capella singer unite! This album, a compilation of the best tracks by the best groups of the 2000-2001 year, has just as much spirit and style as the last few albums. The music on this CD is how everyone wishes they sounded while singing in the shower- with a full group of backup singers! Its more living proof that the human voice is infinate in range, and that instruments just aren't necessary. As an ex-Wellesley Widow, this CD brings back every moment on stage and makes me wish I were still singing. Anyone in San Diego want to hook up for some vocals?!? :)"
2,"Can perhaps admire the structure, but not the book itself","I truly didn't care what happened to Sammy, the protagonist, and I couldn't be bothered to finish it after reading perhaps three-fourths of it."
1,"How bad it was, how bad","A friend of mine told me that you had to be a man to appreciate this book. Perhaps so, because the character and the story held no interest for me. I read other reviews that say the story-line was suspenseful. I did not find that. In fact, I put the book away with 50 pages to go because I was so bored and genuinely did not care what happened to our hero. The style was certainly original, but not Booker Prize material."
4,pretty good,The taste was pretty good but it could've been better but it was still good! Definately worth a try though!:-)
4,Good Farnham,"If you liked Whispering Jack,as I do...this is as close as it gets.He again gets help from his bandmate and guitarist extroadinaire Brett Garsed.Farnhams voice is strong on this cd.And it doesnt sound like theyre shooting for the elevator to get played in,like some of his other albums.My 2nd fav Farnsey cd"
2,Something lacking...,"Freedy Johnston earned the right to be called ""an American original"" by Rolling Stone when he released ""This Perfect World"". It followed on the heels of ""Can You Fly"", and in tandem, these are two of the best singer-songwriter records you'd ever want to buy. The imagery inherent in the lyrics, the power of the story telling and the melody that tied it all together left you wanting more.Unfortunately, this album doesn't hold up to the standards Freedy set for himself. He almost sounds like he's gotten lazy, ripping off his own, now tired chord changes. The stories sound as though he rushed his way through the lyrics and the New York edge that spun through ""Perfect..."" and ""...Fly"" is gone.I love Freedy and wish he'd awaken to his former self."
1,Very disapointed!,"I am very disappointed!!!This book is not about implementing 802.11, but about interfacing to an already existing implementation of 802.11 residing in a compact flash card. 802.11 is about the physical and MAC layers, therefore ""Implementing 802.11 with microcontrollers"" would involve interfacing a microcontroller with an 802.11 compatible radio(e.g., FHSS or DSSS) and then actually implementing the 802.11 MAC (e.g., DCF, PCF, CSMA/CA, RTS/CTS, etc....). I am very disappointed!"
5,Don't buy an aftermarket aerator. Buy this.,"If your Delta faucet seems to have lost pressure/function after many years, just buy this and save your money and time.I must've purchased 3-4 different aerators attempting to bring water pressure levels back to what they once were.As soon as I installed this, normal pressure/function returned."
1,Could be remembering wrong but it's full of using God's name in vain,Could be remembering wrong but it's full of using God's name in vain. I had to shut the movie off for good after just a few minutes. I never even got to know the story line. It's been years since that attempt to watch it and to this day it goes down as one of the worst movies I have attempted to watch.
2,so so,beautiful nature - the movie is just ok - wouldn't recommend it - pretty boring at times - had to fast forward it.
3,"A majestic tale of love, loyalty, and loss that rambles","The cinematography was well deserving of its Oscar award, and this role set Brad Pitt up for the megastar title bestowed on him by Legends of the Fall--a similar and more emotionally satisfying experience."
5,review on Wiseman,very insightful book that gives a easy to read description to the history of 1st and 2nd kings. Amazing author that knows what he is talking about
1,Soap Opera Script. Passed Off As History,"Paris In The Terror, June 1793 - July 1974, Stanley Loomis; J.P. Lippincott Company (1964)Purple prose purgatory (pulped)."
4,Lost in Meditation: Meditative Gregorian Chants,"In this world of constant noise and interruption, it is nice to take an hour to meditate and listen to the Gregorian side of life. The eighteen selections on this CD are refreshing to the mental, physical and spiritual aspects of the complex human beings that we are.As I listened to the chants, the sun is about to set. The light is streaming through the window, and out the window the signs of spring are visible after a long, harsh Midwest winter.So, if you enjoy Latin chants, then this CD is for you. If you have never listened to the Gregorian chant, then this CD would be worth an investment.To be honest, when I first encountered the Gregorian chant in high school, I was not too sure if I wanted to take the time to listen and meditate. I had too much to do. Now, decades later, having too much to do is not always the best plan for life on this planet.Carpe diem. Enjoy."
5,A MUST BUY!!,"People, if you have never heard of HARD Trance like this before...DJ Networx rocks the house with this awsome imported CD. Trust me, it is worth buying and the mixes are AMAZING!!!! it will leave you wanting more, hell, replaying the whole CD over and over again until you get bored of it."
3,Another thumbs up for Du Maurier,"Like the other raters here I can't stand when someone gives out the whole summarization of a book. The point is to give ratings.This book: another highly recommended read by Daphne du Maurier. I'm a fan of the author and like her other books she has done a fabulous job here. It's an easy shorter read and good for anyone that enjoyed Frenchmans Creek, Rebecca or My cousin Rachel.Thanks to the other raters who have respected the intentions of thes reviews."
2,Weak attempt to invoke mystery and romance in the novel,There were little mystery and romance that DuMaurier is famous for. Failed to stir up reader's interest as the plot is weak and characters are not well developed.
4,Good book,"Good plot, characters and a great depiction of the Cornish coast give this novel a real boost. Not as good as Rebecca, but recommended, nonetheless."
2,Was a waste of my money,"I need to start buying the movies with the 2 and 3 stars,like ' 30 Days of Night' and 'The Strangers' since those are the ones I really thought were good enough to get 4 to 5 stars. This movie was slow and I it got boring. I had to make my self watch all of it."
3,It was interesting!!!,"THIS MOVIE WAS INTERESTING AND THE STORY LINE WAS NOT PERFECT, BUT THE COMPUTER VISUAL EFFECT WAS GOOD. THIS MOVIE WAS NOT BORED. IT'S INTERESTING MOVIE."
4,I Love Agatha,"The further this series goes, the more I enjoy it.Agatha Raisin has spent the last six months back in London and away from her beloved Cotswold village. No sooner is she home but there is a murder for her to solve. Ever eager to be of any help when there is a mysterious death involved, Agatha and her nosey pushy ways jump right on in.Posing as husband and wife with her hottie neighbor James Lacey, Agatha sets out to find the murderer of Jessica Tartinck, a local hiker who has angered local landowners by insisting that her walking club has the right to cross through their fields.Agatha gets to live out a secret wish that might not just be wishful thinking after all. These are quite endearing little books that keep the cozy genre quite cozy. Bundle up and enjoy."
3,"Works, Generates RF Interference","Works as advertised, construction is solid, LED glows green or red, depending on charging status which is nice. Treo end of the cable was extremely tight initially, so tight I was actually concerned about pushing it in as hard as I did. However, it loosened up after two or three times.The cord generates a tremendous amout of RF interference, to the point that AM radio stations cannot be heard depending on the station's strength. However, I'm listening to the radio less and less so its most likely not an issue. Interference was not detected on Ham 2M radio or commercial FM, just commercial AM."
3,Awesome cooking but AWFUL cleaning,"I bought this set over a year ago, and I was very happy with it at first. After a year of everyday cooking, I'm far from happy.The problem in one word: CLEANING!I've eventually used my pots & pans for sautee and deep fry and --of course- oil spills on the sides of a pot when you do that, and with the heat it sticks to the bottom and sides of the pan/pot.I've tried every single cleaning product recommended by Calphalon, and I'm still not able to clean the oil marks, and they keep building up. I have them hanging from the ceiling on a pot rack and now I have to hang them inside out because the bottoms look disgusting. Not a decorating set anymore!"
1,Full Screen Theatrical Edition,"This version is terrible on a wide screen TV. It is formatted such that all the subtitles cannot be seen, they are cut off at the bottom. What a waste of money!!!"
4,BEWARE! of EXTENDED length Blue ray version.,"As others have written, this film will be ranked as one of the classics of all time. I loved every detail of it. No need to repeat the praise of others. However, if you are interested in purchasing this Blue Ray product, you should be aware that this is the extended length version of the film, and it detracts from the beauty of the original. It becomes draggy and a little disjointed. If anything, it proves the importance of good editing in the original. Look for the theatrical release. Four star rating only because of this. I returned it to Amazon and ordered the Blue Ray Region Free edition.***Please not that the above paragraph DOES NOT apply to the Region Free Blue Ray edition. I expect that it will be the theatrical release. Will update when I receive it."
2,It's the official history now,"There is a famous piece of educational research where a class of school students compare two films - the 1950s western 'Searchers', and this one, 'Dances With Wolves'. Nearly all of them believed Dances with Wolves to be the more historically accurate film even though it is about as accurate as Mel Gibson's roles in Braveheart, The Patriot (well just about any of his historical roles come to think of it).This is not a dig at Costner, Hollywood studios or anyone else for producing such a PC pap romantic movie. Storytellers, filmmakers have always distorted history somewhat to tell a good story. The real sadness lies in our own failure of history education, leading to our ignorant credulity when hoards of us watch such films and believe they depict some kind of historical reality.As H.L. Mencken so wisely put it. No one ever lost money underestimating the intelligence of the general public."
1,Horrible Injustice,"Kevin Costner, one of the most racist and arrogant actors in hollywood, destroys history for the sake of a higher grossing movie. When I first saw the movie I was filled with sentimentality. Then when I did some research and found out almost everything in this movie is wrong or told wrong."
1,one hell of an epic,"this movie drags after the first act. the movie feels like its 4 or five hours long. so its amazing to me that they recut the movie to make it longer.many people have commented that this movie is PC becasue the white men are bad guys and the native americans are noble savages. I completely disagree. Instead, I see it as the Indians are in trouble and cant find buffalo or fight off the neighbor tribes until the magic white man comes in and shows them how its done.so dont buy this movie if you want to be entertained. or teach history. or show any sort of flattering view of native americans.this is pulp escapist fantasy - I would catagorize it with early 20th century pulp with a dash of late 20th century."
1,disappointed,"though I love the movie and this product looked to be in excellent condition. Once we watched it, we realized the subtitles were missing to translate when the Indians were speaking in their native tongue. Even when turning the subtitles on through the whole movie, the indian translation was missing which made it hard to follow along."
5,Improving on an already good thing,"While some may complain about the length of this film, I found the additional 52 minutes most enjoyable.It was mentioned in the commentary the these scenes had been deleted, not because they weren't important but to keep the movie length to a time acceptable by theatres. I think if you're going to see a movie like this then the extra time is well spent.Dances With Wolves is one of my all time favorite movies. The storyline is good, the acting is great and the music and scenery is awesome. I can't reccomend Dances enough, wheter you've seen it a hundred times or for the first time, I think you will find it an experience that you will keep forever.If you like this movie I would also reccomend 500 Nations which is another Kevin Costner epic. Its the historical account of Native American History and I was able to get it from Amazon at a very good price.Hope you enjoy."
5,Connecting with Something Special,"I lived the life of John Dunbar for many years when I moved from California to an Indian reservation in the Southwest. I learned the beauty of the Native American people and their land over those years. Every time I watch this movie my connection with both land and people is rekindled. This is a special movie, one that treats the Sioux and what is now our shameful history with great dignity, insight, and respect. Perfect audio and video transfer to DVD. Highly recommended."
2,not a PG-13,"this movie is wrongly rated as a PG13. it is much more adult than many R-rated movies. there is graphic violence and wounds, an explicit sexual situation, and strong language. not reccomended for kids under 15."
2,Racist movie.,"I loved 'Dances with Wolves' when I was younger, but when I went back to watch it again recently, I turned it off half way through. First of all the movie is racist toward whites. Kevin Costner seems like the only white man who has sympathy for American Indians. Costner depicts whites as sloppy, drunk, and incompetent, while depicting the Native Americans as pure, noble, and peaceful. The settlers who came from Europe did horrible things to the American Indians, but that does not mean the American Indians were all pure at heart and the white man was all evil.The war and genocide that occurred between the two groups is what almost always happens when two people of different race, religion, and ethnic groups conflict with each other. Costner was paying respect to the Native Americans and that was a good thing that he did. The American Indians deserve it up to a point. But don't go around thinking they were not deeply flawed and did not have darker side like other human beings."
2,Everything is great... EXCEPT,"The BluRay cover to this film, which was my tipping point on buying this movie on BR, is not as shown in the picture. The outercasing is not what is shown in the pictures. False advertising and I'd like my money back."
1,"Oh, I hate that!!","I was enjoying ""Dances with Wolves DTS"" (the most recent addition to my growing DVD library), but when I got to chapter 9 my Denon 5000 DVD player protested and would proceed no more. The audio tracks dropped out completly and the picture went totally haywire, and it stayed that way right thru to chapter 17. Oh I hate that! Playback from chapters 18 onwards was perfect, so if you're happy just to watch the beginning and end of a movie, and miss everything in between, then ""Dances with Wolves DTS"" is for you. Come-on Image-entertainment, whatever happened to quality control!!"
5,Fantastic!,"Before getting this battery I had the stock battery for a year and a half. I plugged it in every night and towards the end I couldn't even make 1 call on full charge. I got this one, and charged it once, and I don't charge it unless it is completely dead. It lasts a WEEK!!! Very happy!"
4,A fabulous tale,"I loved this book, but it really depends on your nature and your comedic status. It's English humor, so if you've never laughed at ""Monty Python"" and you've never watched ""Fawlty Towers"" don't bother. But if you have, then you will enjoy this. Of course, this book is not all humor and laughter.It's a sensitive, beautiful story of Saffron (""Saffy""), a young girl who wonders why she is not like her siblings. She befriends a young girl who helps her discover that her past is unlike the past of her siblings, and that Saffy is a different kind of angel."
4,Eye Opening!,"I was amazed at the painstaking research that went into this book by an author who admits even he was a skeptic going in. It really makes one think about the proper role of government in society, and the harm its well intentioned welfare programs cause compared to the good of private giving."
4,Gilad's Great,"This product offers a chance to workout to Gilad's great instruction at the time and place of my convenience. His directions are clear, and the DVD specifically states what it does."
1,The Great Italian Disappointment,"I found the book, ""Great Italian Desserts"", to be a tremendous disappointment.For the amount that it cost ($110) I expected nice paper and glossy color photos. Neither of which existed in the book.Though I am a chef by profession with over 30 years experience there was much lacking in explanation/directions in recipes that prevented a thorough understanding of the execution.It does not matter to me if Nick Malgieri is the greatest pastry chef on the face of this earth. The book lacked much, so much so that I have not even been tempted to make anything from its contents. It will probably end up just sitting on the kitchen shelf amongst some other disappointing recipe books.A big thumbs down and still crying over my $100+ ....."
3,Another Editorial Review,"""Apart from 'She Wants to Dance With Me,' Astley's second album didn't have songs as strong as those on his debut. Most of the album was pleasant dance-pop filler, showing the weaknesses of the Stock, Aitken & Waterman production team. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide"" [refers to 1989 Album Release Date, RCA/PWL Label]"
5,Hold Me in Your Arms -- Rick Astley,Rick Astley is AWESOME!!! All of his music is Great! This album is no exception.
1,a failure of capitalism,"This product is a lie. It's a seductive piece of machinery (it knows sunrise and sunset times at various latitudes, to mention one feature) and on the surface it fits perfectly the needs of many people, including me. But it breaks so often that the company cannot possibly be unaware of its amazingly low reliability, and it is surely immoral if not illegal to keep selling it (class action suit anybody?). I installed four of them and replaced two, not too mention the numerous times I had to pull out the battery to reset the device, and then reprogram it. Now I am just replacing them with regular switches as they die. I am down to two, so four out of six failed within a year. I don't know why serious stores still carry them---it damages their reputation too. Stay away, don't let it seduce you."
1,Fifty Dollars of,"Do NOT buy this timer!!I purchased this Intermatic 7-Day Timer through a contractor, before I knew about the lower price at Amazon and Home Depot..so I paid 50 dollars for this timer.After two months, I got the ""No OP"" Error on the screen display. In fact, this Intermatic timer would no longer even just work as a simple switch to turn the lights OFF. I was forced to unscrew three lightbulbs just to turn out the lights for a week until the contractor could come to disconnect this ""No OP"" garbage.[...]Good Luck!"
1,Another displeased customer,"I though it was just me but I'm also a member of the ""NoOp, dead after a few months group."" It's too bad since it works great when it works but it goes dead after a few months -- every time. I'm on my third Intermatic -- I guess I'm more stubborn that the rest."
1,This company are ripping people off with a shoddy product,"I've now been through five of these timers - had the same problem that everybody else has had - no op. The mechanical aspect of the switch is the cause. I've no idea why Intermatic don't get this resolved - nor why shops like Home Depot don't stop stocking them. I can only guess that either the Home Depot doesn't care, or not enough people are complaining.Don't buy this product - find something else"
1,"Gone Through Two, Both Stopped Working","My first of these switches lasted about a year, and was replaced by Intermatic. The second one lasted for a few months before getting the popular ""noop"" condition. Save your money and stay away.I replaced mine a few months ago with a Leviton LCD Timer from SmartHome. (Unfortunately it's not sold on Amazon) The interface is simplistic, and you only get one daily program. But it WORKS!"
1,"""No Op"" Everytime within a year",They're a great idea that is VERY POORLY built. I've had SEVERAL of these because I like the function of automatic lights for the front of my house. But I've had at least 5 of them break within a year of purchase. I'm done buying them and I'm trying another brand now.
1,Do not buy IndoEuropeanPublishing edition,"I just returned this edition due to the remarkably poor typesetting and proofreading of this book. In the first 16 pages there are multiple misuses of hyphens and em-dashes, erroneous punctuation, and the omission of even a simple ñ in the spanish word señor. It's really a shame that such a great text is being represented so poorly."
5,Unattractive topic made surprisingly interesting,"George Orwell must be an excellent writer because, in all honesty, I wasn't overwhelmingly interested in reading about the Spanish Civil War. Nevertheless, I really, really liked this book.Understanding the history behind the war isn't a necessity, but I definitely recommend bringing yourself up to speed via wikipedia before starting. That way, Orwell's personal recollections, which are the meat of the book, will be more relevant to you.Orwell presents a refreshingly honest account of the war and his own evolving take on it. Spain's resulting chaos is a prescient warning for those who take too passionately and seriously partisan politics. Orwell shows that it never takes too long before ideals are thrown out the window to be replaced by the centuries repeated same old quest for power.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Spanish Civil War, human nature's struggle for power, or Orwell's insightful, often humorous observations."
2,Very dissapointing handles (and no spoon),"I must say I didn't notice the metal handle or I certainly would not have bought this pan. It was the ideal size, and I wanted a glass cover. But metal handles get hot, and are not acceptable. This handle is also very long, which isn't obvious in the picture.The glass dome lid is high and I would like it, except that its handle is made of some rough metal that is uncomfortable to pick up by hand.And also, there was no nylon spoon.I have other calphalon with good handles. I'm going to send this one back and search for more like that. This kind of pan might look more ""professional"", or whatever. But, unless you cook with potholders everywhere (which I don't), it's just a pain."
1,The Power of the Machine,"This is a compilation of academic papers not intended for the lay reader.The numerous embedded citations are distracting. It is written in sociological jargon rather than English. With hundreds of heavily referenced ideas, there are a few nuggets of wisdom, but these are painfully hard to unearth."
2,Forgettable -- and how,"I've seen this movie three times. You might ask, how could I have seen this movie three times and yet call it forgettable? Because I forgot I'd seen it and rented it twice more. My SO and I stood at Blockbuster and said, ""Oh, I heard this one was good,"" and then paid the money for it, took it home, stuck it into the VCR and realized, ""We've seen this before..."" and the last time ""TWICE"". I find the acting excellent, the cavalcade of stars interesting -- but overall, I found the movie superficial and boring."
5,Scathing Hollywood satire,"This is a wonderful inside-Hollywood thriller/comedy directed by Robert Altman. Tim Robbins stars as a big shot producer who begins receiving hate mail from one of his rejected writers. He thinks he's figured out who it is (Vincent D'Onofrio), goes to meet him, and in a rage kills him. He then falls in love with D'Onofrio's weird girlfriend (Gretta Scacchi), an artist who can't ever finish anything. There is also a movie within the movie which has to do with the making of a melodrama in which an innocent woman is about to be executed - only to be rescued at the last minute by the D.A. Altman's theme has to do with the Hollywood version of reality, which is nothing more than what will earn big bucks; it has nothing to do with ""truth."" A long list of Hollywood stars make cameo appearances. It's really a well-done movie, very classy and hip. Altman also satirizes Hollywood power players extremely well - it's a whole other world out there in LaLa land."
4,Good read.,"Worth reading. Some silliness, but mostly an entertaining, reasonably well edited novel.The love bit is over the top, but doesn't spoil it."
4,Aliens stuck on earth,"Awesome alien profile. The only fault is with 10 pages to go you can tell there is now way to wrap it all up. No explanation of alien tech, which is becomming the standard these days. The ending was very abbreviated."
2,A quick read,"I found Haldeman's work easily digestible, yet unsatisfactory. There are a number of weaknesses evident in the writing style and plot development. The most irritating have already been indicated by other reviewers. Looking to read anything at all? This is your book. If you want better Haldeman, check out The Forever War."
3,This won a Nebula award?,"No, seriously...this WON a Nebula award? It was a fun read, with an interesting premise, but there isn't a single groundbreaking concept in the entire book. The ending is terrible. The story is cruising right along and things JUST start to get interesting, and BAM...Joe suddenly ends it in about 2 pages. I praying it isn't ended this way as a setup for another unwanted (or un-needed) sequel or series.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Camouflage as a light, entertaining read (I mostly read it in the bathroom =) ) but it's about as far away from a Nebula contender as I've seen in recent memory."
3,Sprinkles Addict,"I'm addicted to sprinkles. They tend to be very expensive at the grocery stores, so I decided to try this kind. I received the product in timely manner and well packed. However they don't taste like the kind your would get from a Yogurt place or grocery store. The sprinkles do taste fresh, but they are too sweet and it overpowers the ice cream/yogurt taste. If you don't really care much about how sweet they are, then go for this kind. On the other hand, the chocolate sprinkles from this company do taste much better than this rainbow kind."
2,"Sabicas& Escudero, Espana En Dos Guitarras...","I was disappointed. The quality of the recording was not good.I own an old vinyl album of the same artists and similar selections and it is excellent. The playing is more exciting and the recording is very good.I had hoped that the new CD would be an even better, updated version. Sadly, it is not. Don't waste your money."
4,Go lightly with Salley Vickers,"As my first exposure to Salley Vickers work, I was pleasently surprised and pleased. Her narrative is very good and descriptive, and while her plot is not terribly complicated it was good reading.I will be reading more of her works to see if her discriptive methods continue.I enjoyed this novel and recommend it to others."
3,Blah!,"This stuff pack is definitely not worth it. Sure, they supply us with pretty dresses, suits, balloons, balloon arches, chairs with balloons tied to them, and arches, but otherwise, there's not much else. I guess the only good thing is that we finally have birthday cakes (like other reviewers have mentioned, most of this stuff won't even be used and wedding cakes are inedible, but for some reason birthday cakes can be consumed).This stuff pack came out a whole year before Double Deluxe was released. Purchase Double Deluxe instead; you'll get this AND Nightlife for the same price.EDIT: I don't know why my rating shows up as four stars. I had originally selected three stars. I guess now I could say, it's anywhere from 2.5 to 3.5 stars."
3,Just a Stuff Pack,"I did like the additional formal clothing styles it added, other than that, I haven't really seen any new stuff that I've used."
5,The Sims 2 Celebration stuff,"The Sims 2: Celebration StuffIt is really exciting trying to figure out what you sims at your party would like to do. Some may want to dance, while others want to wear nice clothing!"
3,Not really worth the money,"Ok, Let's just get this out of the way. I LOVE the Sims 2. I have all the games and stuff packs. For the money the best stuff pack was GLAMOUR Life. That pack contained some AMAZING stuff.This pack has some wedding dresses and new Tuxedos, but they aren't very flattering. They are like the vest and tie outfit, they make the males look bulky.Some new hairstyles for the ladies, some are very pretty.This is mostly decorative chairs and tables, a new buffet, a new grill, some floral centerpieces and wedding arches.If your Sim is a wedding planner, then this is the Stuff pack for you. LOLOverall, I am not too thrilled with it and am glad I didnt spend more than $20 on it."
5,i agree - should be back in print,I read this book back in my childhood. Enjoyed it so much I wrote the author. I still have the letter I received in return. Imaginative and mind stumulating reading for children.
2,Too long and boring for my toddler,"I got this DVD for my 2-year-old daughter, who loves the Barney shows. The movie is 78 minutes long! Maybe good for a 4-year-old and up, but not for a toddler. It is not like the TV show. There is not a whole lot of singing and music like the TV show. I guess it would have been okay to see in a movie theater, but my daughter gets bored with this DVD at home. Cute movie for an older child (maybe age 4 and older)."
5,Best Barney Video,My daughter loves all thing Barney! Santa brought her this video for Christmas & it's currently her favorite. It's actually my favorite one too. It's quite obvious this film was made on a much higher budget than all other Barney videos.
2,Barney Haters Avoid,"This movie is fine for children, but not for Barney haters. Possible that even Barney fans will hate this.Crazed Barney Fan (teen) - 7/10Crazed Barney Fan (kid) - 9/10Barney Fan - 6/10Barney Hater - 2/10Adult - 3/10Newbie Fan - 7.5/10Me - !?What was the MPAA rating people thinking? This shouldn't be rated G, it should be PG, PG13, R or even maybe NC-17! Anyways, this movie sucks. Your toddlers will enjoy, some scenes were ok, but just kinda stupid."
4,pretty cute,"You'll either love Barney or be so annoyed by him that you want to scream. There's not much room in-between there. Obviously, this movie is aimed at the much younger crowd. I watched it while I was baby-sitting one time, and it was cute enough. If your kids like Barney, they'll like the movie. Simple as that. Barney fans get what they want in this movie, and they won't be disappointed."
3,Not Really For Children Under 4,"Well....I read the other reviews and was puzzled at accusations of profanity. Where???? I thought it was a good, fun movie. There were some dance scenes, like one in the Bird Lady's treehouse, that were over choreographed to the point of absurdity, but that is something only an adult would roll their eyes at. Most important are the reviews of my 1 and 3 year old. My one year old watched for about 5 minutes and was off doing something else, my 3 year old watched it with quite a bit more interest, but didn't understand the thoughts of the older boy in the movie. I think he will appreciate it more in another year. I think that it's at least worth a rental."
5,Hold the sugar,"I've owned my copy of this since 1966; but only last year did I learn how much sweetening the engineers at Columbia had added to Poeme Electronique. The label, Sub Rosa, a European outfit dedicated to avant gard music, released Varese's piece as he originally realized it, in a compilation of noise and electronic music three or four years ago. It's dry - dry, dry, dry. I suspect that, in the context for which it was intended - as background (!) music for the Philips pavillion at the 1958 Brussels Exposition - the dryness was moisturized by the acoustics of the building's interior. But that's only a guess. I now look forward to whatever research is necessary to discover the composer's feelings about all the foregoing. Or, maybe I'll just take a nap."
5,"Classic metal album, better than all the 90's!","An amazing album. It's powerful, melodic, it has the great voice of Paul, great guitars work and an amazing bass line. this is Steve Harris' best album for sure. The tracks are all very good and complex, there are 2 amazing instrumentals in this album which will make you see how good of a music this album contains, the song Murder in the Rue Morgue is a great powerful metal tune, but it's not the best track on the album, because every track is diffrent and they all show how metal should be. A MUST BUY EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A MAIDEN FAN!"
1,Hard Clean,"I am very disappointed in this grill. I followed the instructions carefully. I used the grill only one time the food stuck, and the grill won't come clean, a waste of money."
2,Not good cookware,"I have tried using this griddle to prepare several different types of dishes, but I have yet to have a single dish that did not stick to the griddle and make a mess. And since you can only hand wash it, the mess is even more a problem to remove.As one of the other reviews said, this is better used as a serving dish or the keep food warm, I cannot recommend this griddle as cookware."
2,"NOT BAD, BUT NOT GOOD","Not as good as I thought it was going to be, but still not bad. I'm just glad I rented it instead of buying it. It was an excellent cast, it was just too bad they couldn't do more with them. The only person in the movie that did a good job of acting was Freeman. There was a lot of action, but most of it was too fake. And was it just me or was every person in the movie a little too stupid?"
2,Would Have Been Good...,"This movie was ""alright"". The action was top-notch and building an entire city set and then submerging it under water is impressive, BUT the movie simply had NO story-line what-so-ever. No character development at all. The moive goes a little like this: Here are the characters, this is what they're gonna do, now enjoy. The only reason I gave 2 stars is for the action and I have a thing about rain. Don't ask. ;-)"
5,one of my favorite movies,"great movie,great acting,good length of time. this movie has it all although it is action/suspence it has good acting. little hint for ya if a movie has a really flashy 3d like cover the movie is nothing more than an 90 miniute piece of junk. but if it has a average looking cover and is into the 100s in time lenght you got a good movie. i would definitly buy this movie."
3,Could be Better,"Nice to see some diversity from Betty White. Morgan Freeman, as always, a delight to watch. Too many things in this movie were impossible to believe; almost corny."
4,Great Movie,"I love this movie. Fast paced all the way through. Bought at a wonderful price, seller sent it right away. I would definately recommend anyone purchasing a DVD to get it from this seller. And if you have not yet seen this movie - watch it."
3,James Last Remix,"This is a very strange CD, I don't know what to make of it really. There is only (2) songs that are great. Also I'm confused on the Re-mix thing?"
1,3 Months Later...It Fell Apart,"My beautiful garden arbor that I've had only since June finally collapsed into 3 pieces. As you might have read in my previous review, my husband and I fortified the shoddy construction with additional screws and glue. It just really couldn't withstand the Texas heat. I'm not sure what happened to the thing, but it started rotting on the top/center about 2 weeks after we set it up. Then, the side rails split and finally broke on one side. And it was just sitting there! No more big storms, just the Texas heat. Maybe it melted the glue? Who knows, but my money did not entirely go to waste. I've cut off the top on one side and saved both planters. They are still in one piece. My new advice, pass on this arbor"
2,"Cute, but isn't going to last long","Very cute toy! I was hoping by reading previous reviews, that this toy would be resistant to taking apart. My 18-month old doberman is more than equal to the task. She's had it for about 15 minutes, and has almost taken off one wing. If you have a dog that uses her front teeth to worry stuff apart, this may not be the toy you want to spend over $10.00 for. We'll see how long it actually lasts - and yes, she loves it!A few days in, and had to toss this toy! Our Doberman had a great time with it, but too pricey (and messy) to buy again."
4,Superb!,"I truly enjoyed ""Secrecy"" and plan, now, to get my hands on every Belva Plain novel that I can. Maeve Binchy and Rosamund Pilcher lovers should find ""Secrecy"" immensely satisfying. Plain's writing style is flowing and enjoyable, and I found Charlotte to be a very brave but humanly likable character, and loved the sensitive Roger. The story took a very interesting twist near the end, when Charlotte and Roger's plans for Dawes Square were mysteriously vehemently opposed by Charlotte's father, himself hiding a shocking secret. The ""mob"" aspect of the story was a very minimal, peripheral part of the book."
2,Way too long,"If I give 5 stars to the Bourne series, I would have to give this book 2 stars.- Length: Way too long- Detailes: too many irrelevant ones. I had to skip many paragraphs.- Action packed: Not really. Atleast not compared to Bourne series.- Ending: Huh?!- Is it worth reading: not really- So whats next: I think I will close the book on Ludlum after reading the new Bourne book. It seems that all of his works, carry the same story line. It gets boring after a while. So why am I either going to bother with the new Bourne book, even though it is not written by Ludlum? To just say that I have read all of Bourne books and plus the first 3 were awesome."
2,The Janson Directive,"The suspense of this novel is overpowered by the minutia. Escrutiatingly detailed descriptions of every gadget our hero uses makes one forget Janson has a directive and I, quite truthfully, found myself not cheering for him to win, but simply to get to the end of a painful book. We know Robert Ludlum knows his stuff, but in this instance, he sounds more like an encyclopedia than a novelist."
4,Good but not great,"Most reviews have said what I would have had I been first. If Ludlum in fact wrote 90%, I feel I could pick out the other 10%. Some lines are plain shlock, but overall, this is good Ludlum if you don't get hung up on the lines that don't ring true (certain dialogue). There are also too many incidents where someone happens to be in the right place at the right time. I can't even meet my wife when we plan the time and place. Suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride. Many classic Ludlum scenes and touches make this a good (but not great) read!"
4,Not my usual fare,This is not my normal choice of book But I am enjoying it. Slow going for me as as this is not my normal choice. I have to stop and think through the plot each time as I start and stop so much. But will get another when I am done.
1,Could not finish this book.,I have read all of Robert Ludlums books. The Janson Directive does not read like his other books. It is as if someone else wrote this book and put Ludlums name on it. I found the story dull and very detailed.
2,Ok I guess.,"The whole DVD being black and white was rather boring. Would have enjoyed it better in color. It's almost as if they use black and white to cover flaws in their physiques which was rather disappointing. Also, they keep repeating the same 3 phrases over and over...Come on Branch, please come up with something intelligent to say..ugh."
4,"An amazing panorama of romance, politics and war!","""Ride With Me"" by Thomas B. Costain is the thrilling epic of a young British journalist, one of the first ""war correspondents"" and his battle of words with Napoleon Bonaparte. War ravaged Europe is the backdrop of this tale, full of a cast of colorful characters. The hero must battle with his ideals and his love for the beautiful aristocratic lady who is an ardent Bonapartist. A very absorbing read for history and romance lovers alike. Highly recommended!!"
5,Superb work from the Coens,"Another great movie by the Coen Brothers and one of my favorite works of theirs. This film is hilarious, and its somewhat confusing plot is absoulutly meaningless because of the great performances by Bridges and Goodman. Also, this film has some great supporting performances from John Turturro, Julianne Moore, and especially Phillip Seymour Hoffman whose mannerisms never cease to make eee laugh uncontrollably."
2,Meh,"I don't approve of drug use, and this movie just proved my case further. I stuck it out & watched the whole thing. Sure, it had some funny moments due to said drug use, but other than that, I want my time back."
1,MAJOR disappointment,"I just didn't get it. Not funny at all, ridiculous plot, and a waste of good actors.Bridges is annoying in his cheech and chong role. Goodman is equally annoying, and all he does is curse the whole time. I cant find one good thing to say about this movie. I kept waiting for something, but it never happened. Absolute waste of 2 hours. The most perplexing part is all the good reviews it has gotten. HOW? and WHY?DO not waste your time!"
5,Brilliant like no other movie...,"People I have encountered have often made negative comments about this movie, but I think this is because the people don't understand it. This movie is pure genius, and anybody who has read a raymond chandler novel will understand the incoherent coherence of the plot. This is my favorite movie of all time, because of the amazing character development and the witty dialogue. Other than Raising Arizona there is no other movie that comes to mind with such brillant dialogue. I'm positive that the Coen brothers are the greatest script writers to ever live."
1,the big lebowski,i did not realize it was an HD DVD and the disk will not play in my regular dvd player - i was incredibly disappointed.
1,What?,I had the misfortune on having to watch this trash. I am here to warn you... NEVER EVER SEE THIS BORING NON-SENSICAL GARBAGE!
1,Read the fine print,"I purchased this and didnt realize it was a HD DVD so it wouldnt play on anything I own. Wasted my money, but I learned to read the fine print and slow down when making an order on line."
2,the big lebowski,"This movie only makes sense if you are stoned. A friend who really likes this movie told me that you need to drink a white Russian every time the Dude does......Sorry, this movie was a bust for me."
1,AWFUL,A waste of time. I imagine that stoners liked this movie. Some Jeff Bridges worst and that is really saying something.
5,Classic Coen Brothers,"Most people are familiar with this classic film, but if you are one of the few who haven't seen it, get it. Merchandise was as advertised and arrived promptly."
1,The Big Lebowski. Not!!!,"So shoot me! In this day and age I would thin that if some DVD said ""COLLECTOR'S EDITION"" at the top it would have the various bells and whistles -- would have wide-screen and full-screen versions in the package.Stupid me, when I saw the ""COLLECTOR'S EDITION"" I did not notice that it was a FULL-SCREEN-ONLY DVD package!OK, so I am cryiny the blues now, but why do they do this????No more Coen DVDs for me until I have sold this PoS DVD to somebody.J"
2,The Big Lebowski,"Muchly overrated. Could have been produced on one hour. Some of the scenes were pure ""silliness"" and didnot add at all to the story of the movie."
2,THIS was a must-see?,"So if you like the Coen brothers, you've been told you MUST see this movie. People talk about it in almost reverent tones, but I found it more like The Three Stooges: You either love 'em or hate 'em, and I'm neither a fan of the Stooges or of this movie. Don't misconstrue me to saying this is like a Stooges movie; rather that both are a ""you do or you don't taste.""An obviously great cast, with a few wry laughs, but seemingly weird for weirdness' sake. Plus, it has all the swearing of a Tarantino film without the truly great dialogue (that some of his movies have). If I'm going to be beaten over the head with the language of the docks/high-school, at least give me some substance to go with it.All in all, I felt more in the camp of, ""I wish I had those two hours of my life back"" than I did, ""Glad I finally saw that."""
5,"Amazing, weird movie.","While not for everyone, Big Lebowski is amazing and worth quoting randomly with friends for years. The actors are good, music is great, and the plot is... about a soiled rug more or less.The first time I saw the movie was years ago and my reaction was: ""What.... was that? That was a movie about almost nothing!"" And I've always enjoyed rewatching it with friends since. I ordered a copy of the movie for me and one to give a friend for Christmas as well, he'd never seen it and loved it."
5,"Great film, but not available from amazon for me","The Big Lebowski is a iconic movie that should be available for everyone in any media. It is not. In my country, I cannot find this through the streaming movie channels available, apparantly, it's too old. Amazon has it, but only to US customers. I tried everywhere to watch this legally from my country, but in vain. Finally, I turned to torrent search, and downloaded it for free within 15 min.Why does the movie industry complain over illegal downloading, when they ACTIVELY prevent legal downloading?"
2,The Big Lebowski,Language! There are at least a million words but this film uses one especially offensive word over and over - ad nauseum. I was so put off that I did not get beyond the first four minutes. You are welcome to take this movie back.Wanda Chadwick
2,I suppose it's the greatest movie ever made about bowling,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVED Fargo. And Blood Simple. Raising Arizona and Miller's Crossing I think are pretty decent. But this movie just seems like one long Coen Bros. ""in-joke"". The first fourty-five minutes I thought were uproariously funny, and I particularly enjoyed the fantastic cinematography for the bowling scenes. The movie just got bogged down in its preposterous characters--Julianne Moore, John Goodman as the psycho Walter, and that German techno band (?!) --and situations (one of the most bizarre, yet strangely affirming endings I've ever seen). It's a likeable enough movie (and God knows it WANTED you to like it!), but I have to agree with the Sam Elliot character: I only liked parts of it."
4,Memorable characters,"The acting was top-notch & the characters were well-cast. The story was a little scatered, but the aptly placed lines held it all together. NOT for kids, at least not at my house - but fun for late-night adult-oid ""I'm so tired of thinking"" viewing."
1,"Amazing movie, ripoff version.","I don't think I have to say anything about this unique film. The Dude abides, period.I was excited to hear about this new ""special collector's edition"". It is basically a re-marketed version of the same thing. No interviews, no commentary, no new 'making of' (yes, it's the same making of as the last DVD), and no frills. It's a fleece-the-moronic-fans deal. What a disappointment.Oh, yes. The only new thing it seems to have is ""introduction by Mortimer Young"". Oooh, whopee, that sure is worth my money! Who the hell is that anyway?"
2,BLU RAY Takes forever to load.,"I tried to play this on my blu ray player first, and it would either eject it immediately or just load endlessly for a couple minutes. I said, forget it, ill try my ps3, same thing, without the ejecting. Just stared at a black screen for a few minutes, while on my computer writing a wish for refund to the sender. Then the ""universal"" logo shows up after five minutes of nothing. Other than the obvious frustration this causes, this movie is the best comedy of all time, so I can't be too mad."
3,"If you are content with the first edition, then skip this one!","This ""Collector's Edition"" leaves much to be desired! Such a wonderful cult classic deserves better treatment, that's for sure!Let me just say, if you already have the first edition on DVD, then you really don't need this one. The new transfer is only ""marginally"" better at best! And the ""new"" extras aren't worth the upgrade. The biggest let down is the teaser trailer that was on the first edition is gone here! The documentary is the same on both. And while there is a wonderful photo gallery taken by the great (and grossly underrated) bridges himself, it still not enough bait to make the owners of the first edition bite!I reccomend reading the review at dvdtown.com it's very helpful.If you've seen this film, then you already know it's magic, let's just hope the third time on DVD will be the charm . . . . . ."
5,"""We're talking about unchecked aggression here""","The Coen brothers are masters at what they do: making movies. This film actually gets funnier as you watch it over and over and realize the brilliance of the dialogue and the plot. The way these people think and talk is a whole new type of character. You're KILLING your father Larry!!! These are people who just relax and enjoy looking at life through a less common lens. Pay attention to backgrounds, patterns, random quotations and think about their relavance and/or prevalence in the film, in LA, in the 90s, or in life. The setting of the gulf war is a good place to start. Here's a hint, its not irrelevant."
5,this is actually a question...,"so what's the extra 20 minutes of running time between the original and the collector's edition? i've watched the 'collector's edition' (which by, the way, isn't all that special/collectible) and didn't notice any new scenes or anything. so... any ideas, anyone?"
1,The greatest disappointment,"I am a huge fan of TFF. I am also a huge fan of concert DVDs. The only performance worse than this is the so-called Beach Boys concert from a few years ago. Orzabal is spot on, and his vocal talent remains second to none. On the other hand, Curt Smith looks & sounds like a musician with an acquired brain injury... frequently off the beat or off-key. I had to turn it off after about 10 minutes. There is so much good stuff available, how did they think they could get away with such an uninspired project? If you want a nice contrast, watch it back-to-back with the Depeche Mode Touring the Angel DVD - now that's a concert worth filming!"
5,THIS IS THE MUST HAVE MAIDEN CD.,"If you are new to the world of the NWOBHM bands this is THE cd that defines Iron Maiden. From the opening chords of ""Invaders"" right through this sonic ear splitting ride to the end of ""HaLowed be thy Name"" you are kicked in the teeth and left emotionally strained. This was Maidens first record together with Steve Harris, Dave Murray, ""H"" Smith, Nicko McBrain and the legendary Bruce Dickinson on vocals. This is a MUST HAVE if you call yourself a Maiden fan. GO OUT AND GET IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!! It is a sonic, ear shattering, mind numbing assault on the psyche and you will be better of because of it. UP THE IRONS IN '99!"
4,Keep them coming.,"As always, I enjoyed the Joanna Brady story filled with my favorite characters and the never ending action that J. A. Jance is famous for. I live in the southwest so can easily envision the scenes portrayed in this series of crime novels."
4,Sweethearts until Death,"SKELETON CANYON, number five in the Joanna Brady series by J.A. Jance continues to broaden the scope of a favorite lady sheriff. Just the right mix of family and workplace conflict to keep readers on their toes.Secret lovers agree to met in one of the many deserted canyons of Arizona, but death awaits the lovely Brianna O'Brian. Her Mexican-American lover stand accused by Brianna's father, but why would he kill his love.The beautiful southwest scenery is vividly portrayed by this native writer who grew-up in Bisbee, AZ. The story and the ugliness is a stark transparency over the buff colors of the landscape. Fans are not disappointed, Joanna's family is there to both support and confuse her. They will keep readers coming back.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelGuns Across the Rio: A Texas Ranger in Old Mexico"
4,"Predictable, but enjoyable","Having read some of the JP Beaumont series, I inadvertantly stumbled onto the Joanna Brady series. I like both of them. I am impressed that Jance does equally well with both male and female detectives. The descriptions of the Southwest are really wonderfully done and I like the realistic quality of Joanna's character. She is an unlikely person in the office of Sheriff yet it works because of her organizational and people skills. Eager to read more."
4,another curious conniption...,"The maturity level of Barry's music shines through on his 1996 album Oedipus Schmoedipus. Unpredictable as Soul Murder, but with a more smoothness to the overall texture, this album shows that greatness is in the ability to break any barrier that stands in the way of expression. I can see this is a much more personal album for Barry than any previous works. Not that I pretend to understand the guy or anything..."
4,I enjoyed this book,I'm a big fan of the Kate Shugak series and liked the Liam Campbell series almost as much. My mother has also tried the Liam Campbell series and like it better.
4,Better to Rest,Good story. Lots of Alaskanism. Dana writes for the average reader who likes to become part of the story. Like all her stories.
2,Buyer beware,"The instructions for putting the glider together were poor at best. As for the quality of the glider for the price you pay, well you get exactly what you pay for, this glider is not a bargan... It is made from small remenants of redwood dovetail jointed and glued together. Mine arrived in good condition and I was able to assemble it in about 1-1/2 hours. It glides quietly but it feels cheep. Could have used more sanding the finish in some areas is rough. Cushions are a must at least for the back, it hits you in the wrong place. Just keep all this in mind before you click the purchase button."
1,Look but don't touch (or buy!). Fell apart.,"We operate a small unfinished furniture store and thought we would try out this product through Amazon before committing to a minimum order with the wholesaler. This might be a better product for someone who specializes in Garden Decoration, since it is completely not functional. This bench fell apart after just two months of use. The seat collapsed with one of our customers on it. While it *is* made out of red cedar which gives the impression of durability, the slats are quite thin, and the construction is flimsy. This bench comes ready to assemble - have you got a few hours? The finish does not hold up beyond maybe 30 days, and it is now sitting in a heap behind our store, waiting to be thrown out or repaired. Amazon may have sent a replacement if we had taken the time to call - we just got too busy. You would be better off with somthing else, even aluminum construction from Wallyworld is going to be better than this."
3,Construction,Careful that you compare more than price. Sturdy Construction also matters.Get well Built Cedar Patio Furniture that's Shipped Free at www.GoCedar.com.
5,Good Value,"It's fall, so I went looking for a bargain on a glider for my front porch...Construction is very straightforward; directions were clear; hardware was solid and well marked; only needed to drill out one hole that hadn't gone all the way through. Support pieces are made from multiple small pieces joined together -- which didn't diminish strength or how it looks at all. .... Overall, looks very good, works well, kids like it, good value."
3,a good one time watch!,"Dutt's 2006 Flick 'Dil Diya Hai' is a decent entertainer. Average at best. The story of the film is not interesting,but however the filmmaker manages to make a decent film. The film has its share of Pluses and minuses. An Okay fare.The Performances are good. Mithun Dada continues his Legendary magic with Dil Diya Hai. He's fantastic. Emraan Hashmi is good. Ashmit Patel shines in a Grey role. Geeta Basra looks amazingly hot and does a good job. She's sexy. Kitu Gidwani is good. The music of the film is excellent.On the whole 'Dil Diya Hai' is an average watch."
5,Book about the great Russian comedian,"This is the first book ever written about the great Russian comic actor Savelii Kramarov, about his personal and professional life. The book is writen by Kramarov's friend. It takes you from the actor's modest beginnings, through the period of his popularity among the Russian audiences, through the hardship of emigration, all the way to Hollywood. The book has so much warmth, it tells about the actor in a very ""human"" way."
2,Q is for not Quite up to par,"I have read all the books in Sue Grafton's alphabet series and have enjoyed each one. Q is for Quarry wasn't as good as I had hoped. I felt the pace was rather slow moving, between her ""partners"" illnesses and hospitalizations and the never ending saga of Kinsey and her new found, wealthy extended family, which I feel is being dragged out too slowly. I couldn't wait to finish the book, it seemed too long, and then all of a sudden, it was over. After a book chock full of needless details about fast food meals and all the other details Ms. Grafton always includes, the ending was abrupt."
1,Q is fur Quarry,The person who sent the tape said there was a scratch but playable. Not so. It was in terrible shape with many scratches. Don't buy a cheap tape.
4,Not Sure,"I am still trying to decide if I liked this one or not!!! At times I found it interresting; and times being drug out too much and boring.Will they ever find out who Jane Doe is?There was more on Kinsey's family...will she ever be part of them?When Grafton finally gets to ""Z"" will that be it???"
4,"In the end, a suspenseful tale worth reading","I have read almost all of Grafton's alphabet novels. I was worried that it took me so long to get hooked -- I was some 120 pages into it before I felt the plot really took off -- but the suspense definitely builds in the second half, and the somewhat plodding character development that dominates the first half of the book finally pays off. A worthwhile read -- just stick with it."
3,Not up to par for Grafton,"I was disappointed - although I enjoyed the plot of the story (true Kinsey mystery) the book was too long to support it!! One reason I enjoy Grafton books is they are relatively ""crisp"" in the plot and the dialog exchanges of the people in it. This book went astray from the plot and the characters several times. I would have enjoyed a shorter version of the same thing!!"
2,Boring,"I have read and loved almost all of the alphaget mysteries (with the exception of ""P is for Peril""). This one was excruciatingly boring. I agree with the reviewers who've complained about too much mention of fast food. The book should have been named ""Q is for Quarter Pounder."""
1,A Yawner,"It took me approximately 3 weeks to get through this 350-page novel. That's because my only incentive to return to the book was to complete it.The setting is as desolate as the plot and characters. The plot is a series of back-and-forths between Kinsey's hotel room and the location of her next interview, with a too-frequent reference to a fast-food detour in between for humor (and this attempt at levity missed the mark by the third or fourth mention).Reading this book reminded me of returning to jogging after a long stretch off: it was dull and arduous and I wanted to cut it short after every 50 steps or so and in the end, I was just satisfied that I finally finished."
5,To B or Not To B,"The B-School Survival Guide was a real life saver. I took the 'To B or Not To B' quiz in ... and i was sold! This book answers all of the questions you ever thought of, and even the ones you thought were too silly to ask. Its savey one-liners made it really fun to read, and all the information makes it a great piece of reference material."
2,oops,"My wife wrote this in a fit of insomnia at 4:30 in the morning and accidentally posted it under my name. Not too bright, that woman."
5,Aerobed has paid for itself many times over,I LOVE my Aerobed. I bought it when my kids were young so they could have friends over. But I keep using it! It's so compact that you can take it anywhere. It is simple to inflate - takes less than a minute. And it is SO comfortable. I would recommend it to everyone. It's great to have an extra bed that's easy to store!
1,Poor Quality,"Bought the raised pillowtop In Jan 2005, 6 months later it sprung a leak at a welded seam around the pillowtop of bed. They did send me a replacement and it lasted about 8 months until it looked like a humpbacked whale(about 1 Ft higher in center of bed than edge). They will not replace again because orginal purchase is over a year. The best they could do is give me free shipping on a $300 product that will not last a year NO THANKS, I can get free shipping at Amazon. Be aware that If you spend $300 for the best it will only last less than a year, so who knows about the cheaper ones. For me I will never own another Aerobed product."
5,Better than a *real* bed!,"This jewel inflates quickly, deflates even faster and provides the oldest bones with a wonderful nights rest at whatever firmness the user decides the mattress should be. It is the same heights as a regular bed, so for older folks, getting in and out of the bed is greatly facilitated. This item is a welcome sight for all who have experienced its comfort, and for those who are unaware, a most pleasant surprise awaits them. Storage is a snap, and the bed solves a host of problems for any host or hostess."
5,Great stuff,"Before I left the corporate world, I was convinced that often our need to always remain under the reductionist hat severely limits our ability to truly understand a problem as well as secure the future. How many times have you interacted with your organization with other departments who fend only for themselves? Other questions arise that demand systems thinking approach such any policies, general politics even accounting procedures that often take a reductionist view of an organization. This was a great book to start training the eyes to see the forest rather than the tree."
1,YOU CAN BUY THIS CHEAPER AT TARGET!,"DO NOT BUY from any of these guys!, try your local TARGET! a 6 pack of 24 oz bottles costs barely $10. You are better off going there to stock up! some of the prices on here are ridiculos!!"
1,"Very, very disappointed","Unbelieveable cheap flimsy material. Cannot read letters on sign from outside window. When Rubies the shipper sent box, they just put sign in box WITHOUT any type of packing material. It was beat to heck when I opened up the box, no wrapping material, foam - NOTHING. This was a gift for my son, and I was so sad I had to give his this gift in such poor and unexcusable condition."
2,Cheaply made,I was very disappointed with this when it arrived. I thought it would be better quality but it wasn't. This is more for a Halloween prop than it is to be decoration. Its all cheap plastic and not worth the money.
1,"Great Idea, Horrible Execution","I purchased this prop three years ago at a Halloween store in Michigan, after seeing STOCK images of it online at various shops. Being a huge fan of ""Psycho,"" I thought it was absolutely ingenious; and it is, until you plug it in and see that the manufacturing design of the prop leaves it almost *impossible* to read through a window in the dark. It literally looked like blue bulbs and a red blur in a sea of black plastic.Now, hanging inside on a wall, the prop is slightly more legible and somewhat usable--but who wants it inside instead of in a window, like a REAL vacancy sign? I opened mine up and tried to adjust the bulbs, even placing foil behind them to help with the reflection; it made it barely legible in a window at night.Ultimately, this could have been one of the BEST Halloween props I've ever seen, but the shoddy design makes it worth about $5 instead of the $25+ you usually see it priced at. A shame, really."
3,It's okay,"As is typical with all halloween props/costumes that you purchase nowadays, the quality is extremely poor. However, if you hang it in a window or on the wall as it is designed for and do not handle it frequently, it should last. I do see problems with storing it during the off season as it could easily become damaged. A suggestion would be to perhaps store it in a suitcase (hard case only).Other than that, it does light up sufficient enough for affect and does not make any annoying sounds when lit. Also, it is NOT battery operated so you have to deal with a power cord."
1,Two words: Just Awful,"There are only two words to describe this book: just awful.Looking past the huge amount of typo's, and the terrible use of grammer. You're left with a book with zero entertainment value, a zero on the informative level, and just a horrible boook.I was going to write to the publisher to question their poor choice in publishing this book, but then I realize that the publisher is a pay-to-publish meaning they'll publish anything for a price. This book is a result of that. A poorly written book poluting the market. There is however one positive aspect to this book, and it is that it could be used by teachers of writing as a how not to write a book. Do I recommend it, NO!"
5,Good value,"Exactly as pictured. Easy to assemble. Best used to display potted plants. Otherwise, add screen to the bottom to avoid losing soil through drainage gap."
5,One Maiden's best cd's,"The strenght in this cd lies in the songs Moonchil, Can I play with Madness, Seventh Son, the prophecy, and the Clairvoyant. Great guitar passages throughtout and at timely places whether electric or accoustic. It's not quite as heavy as other maiden cd's but still it is excellent."
4,"Excellent,a triumphant return to form...","Getting rid of the excessive keyboard layers of the previous 1986 album worked miracles,since it afforded Maiden an opportunity to concentrate on their hard to equal dual guitar attack and monster bass;this time around Bruce had a a lot of input making this record-a masterpiece-more of a team effort than the previous."
4,Good album though weak in some areas,"This is how a theme album should be done, the album is pretty strong lyrically though it fades off in songs such as ""seventh son of a seventh son"" ""can i play with madness"" and ""the evil that men do"" are the core of this album both unforgettable songs, espicially the latter with complex guitar riff's tied in with strong vocals and lyrics. One of the truly great maiden albums."
5,The last truly great Maiden album,"While I don't think this is the best Iron Maiden album ever, it is definitely one of their best, and it was their last good one for many, many years. It's also the only real ""concept"" album they ever did. But you can easily ignore the concept; this is a really good listen, and all the song stand on their own. And while the Irons had always had prog-rock tendencies, and even started indulging them a bit more on Powerslave, they really go over to the dark side on this one. There's plenty of the trademark galloping guitars, but also a lot of guitar synth (and about half of those parts probably would have worked as just plain old guitar).While all the songs on this disc are good, my personal faves are the title track, ""Can I Play With Madness"" and ""The Clairvoyant.""I wouldn't start here, but if you've gotten a taste for Iron Maiden, you need this album."
5,SherlockHolmes and the Secret Weapon,Being a Sherlock Holmes fan the Colourized version was very good
5,"ELEMENTARY, DR. WATSON!","Fans of the Universal Sherlock Holmes Series will love this newly-transferred from 35mm negative Holmes/Watson outing. Funny, with today's modern film ""technology"", sometimes we forget that film viewing could be just plain fun...sans explosions and blue-screen effects ad nauseum. Amazingly, it appears that we've simply forgotten what fun it can be to watch a film which is simply filled to the brim with an ensemble cast of professional, not to mention interesting, actors."
2,This is NOT the UCLA restored version!!,"Despite what several customers have written (one even chastising others for slamming this DVD ""when it hasn't even been released yet"") this is NOT THE RESTORED VERSION, this is the dupey, scratched, and horrid sounding transfer that's been around for several years. MPI, not Focus Film, is the distributor of the new restored versions of this series. That said, if you come across a used copy of this version cheap (and I mean CHEAP!!) it has a few nice extras not found on the MPI, like the re-issue trailer (ironically looking better than the feature itself on this disc), and a generous helping of Rathbone / Bruce radio shows that are fun. But for the feature itself the UCLA restoration is the ONLY way to go."
1,Worst DVD transfer I've ever seen since GoodTimes,This refers to the DVD version only. This is absolutely the worst quality transfer to DVD that I've ever seen. I don't think that even GoodTimes could have done a worse job.
2,Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon,First let me say that I'm one of the biggest Sherlock Holmes fans in the world. I have been waiting for years for someone to produce a DVD version of the Basil Rathbone movies. This is my second DVD Sherlock Holmes movie from the Focusfilm Entertainment group and it is no better than the first one. This one is going to be returned just like the first one was. This DVD tranfer is so dark in places you can not see the movie at all. The contrast is terrible and the orginal film had black dots and white streaks all over the place. The sound quality of this tranfer was fair. I have VHS copies of this movie that are twice as good as this DVD version. I hope someone besides Focusfilm will starts making DVD tranfers of this great series. Please save your money for a better product in the future. ---This text refers to the DVD edition
3,SHERLOCK HOLMES DVD SET,"HAVING SEEN ALL THE SHERLOCK HOLMES FILMS WITH BASIL RATHBONE 100 TIMES OR MORE , I WAS LET DOWN BY THE QUALITY OF THESE DVD'S. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN POSSIBLY DEGRADE THE QUALITY FROM VHS TO DVD,BUT, THEY DID. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT???? I LOVE THOSE OLD FILMS AND WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM ON DVD. WHAT A LETDOWN."
2,The Leader's Brain,"The book is way to ""scientific"" in it's reading and less direct in how a ""Leader"" would think, analyze, or process data to arrive at the decisions he would. I found little that I can use in my related work or carry over into my daily leadership activities.This book is more suited, in my opinion, to Psycologists or others who explore the functions and behaviors of the brain."
2,Product damaged,"One corner of the packaging was crushed and the bottom was warped. All casters were broken too. Luckily my hubby is handy and after a trip to the hardware store, he got it together."
2,Slow Reading,This book was written in a different time. There is way too much discussion and not enough content. I found the characters unsympathetic and that includes the heroine.
5,An Oxford reunion and ghostly murder,Dorothy L. Sayers' GAUDY NIGHT benefits from Ian Carmichael's pointed production: his BBC background lending accent and tension to the story of an Oxford reunion which involves mystery writer Harriet in a case of ghostly murder. Tension evolves quickly as murder turns to mayhem in this thriller.
1,Boring,"This was the best book to put myself asleep each night - the most boring book ever read. It took pages for one character to finish a thought. I don't mind period books but this was so formal, couldn't tell one character from the next. It needed alumni of Oxford to understand the terminology of the class system used in the college in the 1930's. I usually love reading British novels but this book was only good to reach for when insomnia struck."
2,a little old fashioned for my taste,Just didn't read the description well -not my type of story. I loved the way the university was described though.
3,Gaudy Night,Too many characters to keep up with. English writing was laborious and sometimes too wordy. Mystery was interesting and keep me guessing.
3,Great story shame about the spelling.,"This is one of the Harriet Vane mysteries, a very strong story with lots of local Oxford colour. The problem I had with this edition Is that it uses American spelling, apparently randomly mixed with some of the original British spelling. Personally I found this very distracting, especially as the English setting is so important to the flavour of the novel. Great story, but I'm sticking to my paperback copy until a proper British ebook is available."
3,1st in series,chaacters were good and it was a female author way back then-liked to know how series started before it became a BBC production.
2,When the drugs wear off....,"The only two discs worth investing in are this groups first two, especially the accidentally brilliant Last Splash. After that, their releases became sheer bloated fuzz with rare guitar achievements, exploiting a slacker fanbase mistakenly equating laziness for edginess. There are perhaps a few tracks that mimic far superior outlines from LS, but the Deal's sloppy-as-witty playing and singing becomes off-putting in the face of such simple songwriting."
5,The proof that movies are art!,"This is as close to perfect as a movie can get. A realistic look into a family, complete with all the struggles and the moments that make the struggles worth the effort. I saw it in a freezing theatre and the film broke twice- and even with those distractions I found the film mesmerizing.Wow!I live in a fairly large city that struggles to show small films. Why do we have to be subjected to multiple screens of garbage that lasts only a week or two as word of mouth gets out? Come on theatre owners - give us a chance to prove we will spend our money on the good stuff."
1,Welcome to Hollywood,"I did not like this film at all. I had hoped to see a film that is observant and critical. A film that shows the fears, hopes and challenges to immigrate to the US. Yet I found that the film that was full of cliches. It was predictable like most of the Hollywood movies. Evil looking black guy who ends up to be loving and wonderful when he meets the two cute girls.A poor family who can not afford health insurance in American, ends up having a third child who is born premature. The enormous hospital bill is magically paid by ""someone"", so the film can close with a happy end. Only in hollywood."
4,dont look past this movie!,"This one slipped be me as I sifted through muddy waters of hollywood. But when i went back I found this piece of gold. Please dont make the mistake I did by branding this a movie about some immigrants living in America. When you look at it like that it just becomes a lesson out of a history book. The Irish family of four comes to America escaping the death of their only son which is ?caused? by a fall down the stairs and strickens the young parents with grief and guilt. The family looks to ""the man who screams"" (Mateo), thier neighbor, for some vitality in life. Ironically, Mateo himself is battling for his own life. Some critics said this was too emotional. I say get out of your little bubble of comfort. Breathtaking performances by each of the four family members, but the real life sisters that played the daughters make Mary Kate and Ashley look like a sick joke. This is Gold!"
5,Disagree with any review under 3 stars,"This movie was great. The acting was great, the ideas were great. I have some very specific bones to pick with other reviews.1. Yes, I do believe a 10 yr old would say something like ""I've been carrying this family on my back for over a year."" If you've never known a precocious 10 yr old who repeats what they've heard adults say then I feel sorry for you.2. Living in poverty is not ""bad parenting."" You are basically saying every poor family has negligent parents. That's a horrible prejudice. Not everyone can be well off and raised as such.3. Unless you lived in New York in the 80's you don't really understand all the things in the movie, the good or the bad.Yes I agree the little girl's camera is way off. Yes, they bring up Frankie at odd times, but it still makes for a very entertaining, heartfelt movie. I recommend it to anyone not looking for a Hollywood Blockbuster."
2,No noticeable change,"Have tried wearing for an extended period of time and noticed no change or improvement. Unable to tell if it helps or not, so that is the reason for my review."
2,"Dietz does Vance, fails.","I tried hard to like this book, and for the first 100 or so pages it was quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, after that it became repetitive and formulaic: travel to a new town/planet, encounter bad guys, beat bad guys, rinse, repeat. It felt as though Dietz was trying to rewrite Jack Vance'sBig PlanetorTales of the Dying Earth, but instead of fresh and strange, each new location was merely a variation on a theme. In the end, the book came across as a personal inner journey for the author which didn't translate well to novel form. My recommendation is that if you like the sound of this book try Vance instead or as well."
1,dull rehash of cliches in Andre Norton style,"Except for a level of bloodletting commensurate with contemporary sanguinary, and presumably more realistic, standards, this reads like all those Andre Norton titles I read in my youth (1966-1972), pre-New Wave (H.Ellison's ""Dangerous Visions"") pablum with no physics in support of its many deus ex machina.Juvenile, uncompelling scifi trappings for a Robert Louis Stevenson pastiche without wordsmithing to match.Since I got both from the public library, I will read the sequel in hope of finding some redemption for the expended ink, paper and hours lost to plodding through this dog.Do not waste a nickel on purchasing this, let alone precious reading time."
5,Outstanding Value!!,"I've been looking for a thermal CD/DVD printer for months. There are a couple out there, but they cost big bucks, more than I wanted to spend. I'm so glad I found this Casio! It prints amazing quality in thermal (not inkjet) ink so it doesn't smear or get damaged by moisture easily. It suprised me how fast it prints also. This is a great printer for small print jobs!!"
5,Does everything I wanted,"I wanted something to give cd's we produce for our customers (in our computer repair business) a more professional look.It produces text output very cleanly.Graphics output isn't nearly as good, but I did not purchase this to do fancy graphics. If you want to do graphics get a lightscribe device.Carefully following the directions, and making sure the ribbon cartridges had the proper tension, I've printed in black, green, red and blue without any problems.The software interface is a little awkward, but is workable.All-in-all I'm very happy with this purchase."
4,Great for simple labeling,"Printer performs well. Set-up was easy. Software gets the job done fine. A tad greedy on ribbon usage, but replacement ribbons are affordable. So much better than the old sharpie."
1,A fraud!,"Word has it that Ravel had another pianist record these piano rolls. Even if it were Ravel himself--who was no great virtuoso, by the way--these recordings were not restored or transferred with anything resembling care, nor is the piano used in the transfer a concert-worthy instrument. As for the orchestral recording of the Bolero, clearly this is an anonymous modern recording and has no connection to the composer.Let's face it, this recording is being marketed as a historical document, and in that regard it has no value whatsoever. Why buy it?"
4,WOW THATS LOUD,This air horn is extremmely loud. the user sould be recomended to wear earplugs. the only downnfall too this product is that if the intended used to to be used constantally for en extended period forget it it runs out of gas. however to make noise at a spports game this is the way to go.
5,Best Maiden CD Ever,A must buy for any rock fan. Every song is a masterpiece that still sounds modern 16 years later.
2,Not as exciting as the first 4 releases.,The only reason this gets only 2 stars is that this album compared to all 11 studio releases isn't as interesting. This would of been a killer tour but songs like The Worst Back In The Village ruined this cd.Still worth getting though if your a fanatic like me.
2,Replace the hardware before you put this up,"Most of the negative opinions are well placed. My primary concern is not covered in previous comments however. Because of the ""tippy"" nature of this ""dome"" you should 1) replace the hardware with better hooks and 2) use locktite (or similar) to connect the two hooks. Because of the jungle gym effect my feeder was on the ground within two weeks."
2,THREE DAYS,IT ONLY TOOK THREE DAYS FOR OUR LITTLE CRITTERS TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT AND GET TO THE FEEDER.
2,Disappointed...,"I am very diappointed in this phone because we've had nothing but problems with it. We've already sent it back once because it wouldn't turn on. We got the optional dual battery and it didn't fit in the base ( I think they sent the wrong battery) so we can't use that. The new phone they sent us is now cutting out on us and is also not turning on and also echoes a lot. The good things about this phone are the range and it has a lot of features but what good are features when the stupid thing won't turn on! We purchased ours from cordlessguys and they've been horrible to deal with.(We're still waiting for the correct spare battery, 6+ months.)"
2,Great Phone - when it's working,"I've had this phone for just about a year. When it works it's great. Good audio quality, very long range (2 city blocks or more), caller ID works perfectly. However, it frequently loses contact with the base unit. When it does the handset insists on beeping incessantly - no way to stop it unless I remove the battery. There seems to be no good way of forcing it to re-establish contact with the base unit. This is extremely irritating and I will be replacing this unit soon. And I will not purchase another V-Tech."
2,Presents a liberal perspective on the Bible,"The Bible commentaries included here are written from a generally liberal theological perspective. The authors discount traditional teachings regarding how the Bible originated and was preserved in favor of more modern theories, which include late dating of the books and questionable authorship. This tends to undermine the authority and credibility of the Bible.If you wish to explore liberal Christian theology, you may appreciate this study Bible. Otherwise, I would recommend you purchase the NIV Study Bible or the NKJV Study Bible."
5,Loud!,"My brother has always dreamed about having an air horn go off when he graduated. He graduated last week, and this air horn did not fail to make him laugh, and the people around us jump!Before graduation we checked the decibel rating to make sure we wouldn't make anyone go deaf. It is rated at 120 decibels, the equivalent of the front row of a rock concert. I would use with caution, as it does its job of being very loud and getting everyone's attention. We used it at an outdoor graduation, and aimed it away from the audience."
1,BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT,"I purchased 3 of these air horns to use at my sons football games. I tested 1 at home, if made a loud sound, I was happy! When we got to the game, only a weak little hissing sound came out, and then liquid started spewing from the horn. I opened a 2nd package, same thing and I can't understand why. I didn't shake it, I didn't over-tighten the ordage horn, but they only work sporadically and were a HUGE waste of money. I purhcase a different air horn (same concept with the screw on top) at K-Mart, it was $22, but it worked great from the first blast to the last! I highly recommend you stay away and save yourself the disapointment!"
4,Loud!,This horn was just what I was looking for for the boat. It's loud and just what you'd expect for a horn of this type.
1,don't buy,"This is a piece of junk, does not work. Air comes out but makes a feeble, anemic noise that doesn't even phase my cat. Not worth the shipping to send back. Go to Wal-Mart and get one that works."
2,I wanted to like this book,"Initially I thought that this would remind me of Richard Russo, whose writings I love. But after slogging through my requisite 100 pages, I found I could not go on. I don't know if the fault lies in the stock situations or characters, but it just seems he takes too many words to say too little."
4,Fairy Tales under Italien Sun,"Imagine being a writer invited to uncover skeletons in the closet of your hosts. You listen to the narratives of different members of the same family under southern sun while you are mildly inebriated by good and not so good, young wine and spicy food. At night your dreams mix up with their stories and during the days you are enchanted by rough but beautiful scenery of the countryside. You may not resist to type it all into your laptop and, at the end, you come up with a novella. It reads well despite many loose ends and sells even better after you win top literary prize (Concourt 2004) for your work. It gets translated into English with a title far away from the original (""Le Soleil des Scorta"") but with a hint of an insight into the Mafia inner working. You end up with a bestseller out of fairy tales. And this is ""The House of Scorta"""
4,Shh! Grrl Power!,"Some groups, like the Breeders, don't need to yell out ""Girl Power!"" in order to assert it. Their hard, catchy guitar-pop is strong and confident, matching Kim Deal's vocals, which range from playful to smuggled-in-from-Eastern-Europe obscure. She sings ""I am the sun, I am the New Year, I am the way home"" as though she believes it, yet doesn't know any better than we do what it means. The unstoppable 4/4 makes this one of the best driving albums ever."
4,Still soaked,"4 1/2This is one of those lo-fi 90's gems where nearly every sonically-indie indulgence works to the band's favor, creating one of those masterpiece-by-accident recordings crammed with utterly compelling, eclectic alternative pop."
5,Splash Indeed,"The Breeders have a unique style of music in my opinion, and this album LAST SPLASH is undoubtably one of my favorites, if not my favorite alternative album of the 90's. It's perfect, its infectuous and endearing, it's everything an album should be, and what I wish music was more like today. Most people know of the single ""Cannonball"", which has been used in many car commercials as a jingle, its a rare blend of spirited vocals and guitar riffs which make you want to rock out! ""No Aloha"" has a flair to it as well, with a unique guitar riff which gives the song a hawaiian type feel to it. ""Saints"" is a fun summer song, as the song says ""Summer is ready when you are"". The vocals of Kim truly bring the album to life with the excellent instrumentation of the band. Other right away highlights and songs to keep an ear out for are ""Invisible Man"", ""Roi"", ""I Just Wanna Get Along"", ""Divine Hammer"" and ""Drivin On"", but overall this is a truly great album that everyone should give a listen to!"
3,Good Concert - Poor Cinemetography,"The music and production are outstanding. However, they are ruined by the video portion. Whoever edited the video seemed to feel a need to show all the video editing gimmicks available. The camera is continuously panning in and out and jumping to different viewpoints. It rarely stays on a scene for more than a second; not leaving the viewer sufficient time take in what is going on. The result is a very frustrating experience."
5,Very good,I loved this show it is so much clearer then teh LOTD video! Hey if you think the camera moves fast in FOF check out LOTD it moves ever 4 secs i swear! Michael has improved very much. Berandette is jsut astounding in her preformance she was who I was impressed teh most witgh. Her and DAmien O'KAin!
1,Feet of Flames - not so much,I have enjoyed all of Mr. Flatley's previous works but this one was just to boring to watch.
1,Mastered at the wrong speed,The songs are mastered way faster than the original records were. The girls sound like they had a dose of helium before recording.
4,"Very clear, but misses some key real-world issues","As others have said, MG is a good introductory text for Information Retrieval. However I think it spends a little too much time on compression techniques and lacks a good discussion of incremental or on-line indexing. The book tends to assume that the set of texts to be searched is static - if new documents can be added or old ones deleted it makes the whole problem much harder and many of MG's techniques are no longer relevant. That said, I strongly look forward to Managing Terabytes (if it ever appears)."
5,Incredibly prescient,"As an example of you-are-there journalism, Shirer's work is as good as it gets, and that's why Columbia University ranked it as one of the century's top 100 works of reportage recently. But Shirer, writing before the U.S. even entered the war, shows himself to be an incredibly prescient analyst of why Hitler decided against invading Britain, for example, as well as how the German-Russian alliance would end and how the U.S. would get involved in the war. All around, this is an excellent book. After finishing it this past weekend, I wanted to drop Shirer a note to say how much I enjoyed it; unfortunately, he died in 1993. All journalists should read this book."
4,A cracker of a story,"For an insight into what the German public and largely disinterested outsiders mmade of the events from 1939 to 1941 this book is a cracker. The confusion caused by the ineffectual responses of the French and British governments, the frustration of coping with German censors, the astonishing lack of impact much the events had on the public (particularly Berliners) makes this narrative a unique one."
4,I read this book here in Brazil.,"I read this book, translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil.It was writen in nazi Germany(some little parts were writen in Portugal).How an american thought about III Reich, living in that times?If you read this book, you can see.The best in this book are the parts about daily live in nazi Germany and in France defeated in 1940."
5,Memories,A first hand account of what led the destruction created by Adolph Hilter and his followers represents some of the best history of the time. A history that should be well known to every American and should be consistently taught in all schools for all ages.
3,The agony of watching the world go wrong,This diary documents the rapid destruction of Europe during the Hilter Regime. It is like watching a slow motion car crash. I prefer historical non-fiction in prose form though. The book seems very repetitive after a while and I began to wish it were over. Shirer does lend a first hand perspective that makes the whole nightmare very real.
5,Filled with surprising facts,Mr. Shirer's Berlin Diary is filled with fast flowing new information and fact supported insights into events which spiraled the United States into WWII. It held my interest and kept me involved page after page. Can't say enough good about it.
1,Astoundingly bad,"As a former Publisher's Weekly reviewer, I have no idea how this clunker got a starred review. Its greatest virtue is that it makes Eragon look like Pulizer material. The writing can only be described as terrible. I've taught high school fiction writing and frankly, my students' products were less clunky, repetitive and difficult to track than this. The quality is so poor that it repeatedly intrudes, making it difficult to engage with the plot. I have a high tolerance for unevenness in this series, but I may not be able to finish this one."
1,Pern as we knew it...DEAD!,"I am severely displeased with Todd McCaffrey's writing. It's sappy, sugarcoated, and the stuff of Disney princess movies. The corny ending made me gag and I cannot believe Anne McCaffrey chose this moron as her prodigy for Pern. Surely there are better writers out there who can continue the legacy of Pern...anyone!? I am saddened to see how Todd McCaffrey is desecrating the world of Pern one book at a time. If there were a lower rating than one star, I would give this vile waste of paper.I will never again buy another book with Todd McCaffrey's name on it!!!!!!!"
1,Really bad!,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was so bad, I actually didn't finish it. At some point about half way through I could see where the whole plot was going, I felt no connection to any of the characters that managed to live more than 10 pages, and I was sick of the plot re-runs. Come on, is there anyone on Pern who has been able to speak to all dragons that hasn't lost their own? Lorana is an irritatingly naive character that I could see was going to kill her own dragon through stupidity. I just didn't want to have to read about it. It seemed that any character that had depth was soon to die and only the insipid or barely drawn ones were left. As others have said, there are way too many superflous characters named for no reason. The plot is a re-run of several previous dragon books. Mainly, there is no one to identify with and to like, not dragon or human.Don't waste your money."
4,Dragonriders of Pern,"I love Anne McCaffrey's books about the dragons. Pern novels are the best ""Fantasy Science fiction"" that you can get. The Pern books started out as a trilogy & now they are up to MANY books and each one is better than the previous."
3,"Good Pern book, but far from the best","I have been a fan of the Pern series of books for as long as I can remember. I even loved the collaboration on the most recent book written by both mother and son. However, this recent book leaves a lot to be desired. The book was good, but it got very confusing with regards to the names of the characters. There were just too many people whose names were the same. I especially had problems with M'Hall and M'Tal (I think those names are right, anyhow). The book was fairly slow in spots as well. All in all, I was disappointed with this book, and have no intention of ever re-reading it (which is odd, since I have read all of the other Pern books over and over and over)."
3,Dragonsblood needed a little of mother's transfusion!,"I have always loved Anne McCaffrey's books, and her son has inherited his mother's skill with words, but perhaps he should do his own stories instead of pushing ahead with his mother's stories. He isn't as familiar with the details as his mother, obviously, or he would have remembered that Wind Blossom was the granddaughter of the woman who created the dragons. And there were other details, like the tea and honey references. I think his mother should have done a peer edit before letting him submit to his editor."
4,A good review of those who have suffered the stigmata,"A very good overview of the evidence for the occurence of thestigmata. Most of the cases point to its reality as a psychosomaticmanifestation of the individuals identification with the sufferings of Jesus of Nazareth. While this view makes the stigmata less ""miraculous,"" it makes the event just as fascinating as a demonstration of what the mind can render through the flesh (those who insist that all the cases are fraudulent haven't read any serious work on the subject). Ian Wilson's Stigmata is also a good read as well."
3,Russo's Codex,"Personally, I loved the first half of this book. The concepts, characters, world-building, and ideas were a treat to read. I loved Conrad's World.But, unfortunately, the latter half of the book fell apart. It got too big for it's britches, so-to-speak. Should have stayed in the divided planet of Conrad's World. I liked the landscape and dangerous exiles there. They made the adventure of this book shine.I would have easily given this book a full 5 stars if Richard paul Russo would've made this go in a different direction. Just became too far out...literally."
2,Not as good as the one that walks,"My daughter & friends LOVED the original Tawny. That finally gave out & I thought it would be fun to replace it with this one which looked a bit more updated...WRONG!!!! This does nothing unless the child does it, my 5 yr old looked at me and asked why it didn't walk or jump by itself.Stick with the original one, lots more fun to play with."
2,Disappointing,"Ellie Haskell is back and pregnant. All she wants to do is stay in bed, eat and be pampered but a warning of danger gives her the push to go to America with her husband Bentley T. Haskell. Bentley wants to become a member of a select group of chefs along with several other unusual candidates. The selection of the one new member of the food society, takes place in a rural area in a strange house on an island. To make matters worse, the house is occupied by a woman who has written a bestseller book about her aging actress mother entitled Monster Mommie. And who shows up? None other than Monster Mommie herself.Ellie is still an interesting character and the book does have some funny parts, but it was not nearly as good a read as the Thin Woman. I felt that the book had a lot of potential but failed to live up to it. I would not recommend Mum's the Word unless you are a die hard Ellie fan."
2,Not as good as The Thin Woman,"I loved the Thin Woman, and was excited to read this book, but never bothered finishing. I found Ellie irritating, not someone I liked very much. I read about 50 pages, and hadn't laughed once."
2,Steak Knives,"Although these knives cut fairly well, I was surprised to see that they rusted after just a couple of washings. I actually hand washed them as I do all my knives and left them to air dry. I scrubbed them with a plastic scrub sponge, however it did not get off all the rust. I had thought that Chicago Cutlery was a good brand. I do realize that they were not that expensive, but I am disappointed in them."
4,High Quality at a Good Price,"This set is better quality than we thought we could get for this price. The knives are hefty, well balanced, and have a substantial feel to them. They cut well, look good, and are comfortable to hold. Very nice set for the price."
4,An entertaining book of mind puzzles and exercises,"If you have time to spare and a desire to exercise your mind in an entertaining way, then take a look at this book.It is not *just* a puzzle book, there is plenty of fact and anecdote to interest you as well. The main theme of the book is simple cryptography, as described in the works of Conan Doyle and Edgar Allen Poe. Obviously you cannot decipher relatively modern cryptograms such as those produced by the Germans in the last world war without a lot of time and a computer, but in previous times when the average person was a lot less well educated many simple codes were baffling to most readers and could maintain secrecy.Understanding how these simple cyphers work and may be ""broken"" is the first step to understanding modern cryptography."
3,a read for pre-schoolers,"unfortunatly, this title never reached me..the book ""the night before the tooth fairy was substituted. I still want this title"
2,Too Slow in Starting,"The first half of the book, I struggled to keep reading. Probably only read it through because I am a fan of Laurens' other works."
4,A wonderful read!,"I never thought a book could be so enjoyable, but yet I found it confusing to muddle through the ideas that D. H. Lawrence presents and also the places that he talks about. The end of the book is really confusing because I found myself trying to figure out what had just happened at the end. But, overall I thought it was a wonderful read, especially if its a library book and you have to return it soon!"
3,emotion commotion,"paul's character became too complex and annoying, a drama king whose personality concerning his mother ,(mommy's boy), frustrated me alot"
1,Taboo Love or Incest?,"Reading this book makes me want to have sex with my mother. The son is in love with his lonely mother. He wants her but he can't have her due to morality issue. What a torture! Avoid it if the idea of mother-son incest turns you off. If incest turns you on, watch the porn movies, Taboo and its sequels, is more satisfying."
5,Everybody needs their own Harold,"Even at 21, Bill Peet is my favorite author. I truely wish he was more popular so that his books would be more available. Move over Good Night Moon for this adorable rabbit and the goodness of just one man."
2,Not worth the price,"The grammar is terrible, it's filled with bad analogies and information that should have been assumed (e.g., RAID - how long has this technology been around?). There's a couple good nuggets but overall, it's like bad reality TV, %5 content surrounded by 95% filler."
1,OracleDBA,"Although this book has a lot of technical detail, it is not well organized - as a result, learn RAC concepts, installation, technology is difficult."
2,Cute but a waste,"This is a cute, stylish, fun-looking car. It stops there, the RC TAGG car is nice but a waste. The car eats up batteries, is to bulky or big for the hand when it comes to pushing, picking-up, and carrying and is too tightly built or constructed; the doors and all keep popping off and there is no simple neat way to open them - hook, space, latch, or tab is not there, it is really difficult to open unsrew for the AA batteries, the wheels/tires do not turn in or out enough and some of my Bratz dolls have to be footless or have a flat hair style to fit into the car. If you just want it for decoration (collecting) the great by all means go on and get it but other than that hold on to your receipt."
1,help!,"Bought the new gaskets and was looking forward to moving on down the road with my Bialetti, but alas it wasn't to be. Oddly, my pot just quit working. I switched back and forth with the old and new filter but the pot refuses to make coffee- other than a few tablespoons of it. What is the deal?? nothing else has changed. I'm flummoxed!"
5,Perfect for tall people,I am tall and have struggled with trying to get a right-sized keyboard stand with a right-sized stool. This is perfect for me and my heavy Roland keyboard. I have set it up so that it is tall enough to use a counter height stool with it. I will note that I am not moving either the stand or the keyboard around so I don't know how it would hold up to that.
5,Keyboard stand - good deal,This was a good deal for the money and seems to be really sturdy. Comes with non slip pads that go on the metal. The hardest part was getting it level since all four legs adjust seperately.
3,Nix is barely back,"The former Alabama State Trouper et. al. is not in fine form, here; this album suffers from mediocre material and lackluster performances and should not be compared to his earlier 70's efforts...COLLECTORS' NOTE: you need to own this so as to better appreciate his Elektra years!"
3,"""Bodies in Flight""","A promising debut collection from Mr. Snyder. Not all the short pieces work (he seems to have a trouble composing endings that satisfy) but the title story is one of the most remarkable tales I've read since Richard Ford's near perfect ""Rock Springs"". Flight is a theme that recurs frequently--sometimes literally (planes and airships), sometimes more obliquely and metaphorically, people on the run, even it's from themselves. The book is blurbed by Stephen King and I note that in his ""Acknowledgments"" the author offers thanks to King's son, Owen (another young up-and-comer). There's a hint of nepotism there that makes me cross. Nonetheless, VOODOO HEART could mark the beginning of a distinguished career in letters. Mr. Snyder has all the makings of a author with a bright future...including, it seems, friends in high places."
1,Dead battery = Dead machine,"Don't spend your money on this device. Mine is recently out of warranty and the battery is a problem. Even though there are replacement batteries for sale on the internet and instructions on how to replace the batteries, neither Sprint nor Palm will perform that service. The only explanation I can think of for this lack of service is an attempt to force an expensive upgrade."
2,"Good PDA, Terrible phone","The PDA features work well. Syncs up easily with computer. However, phone reception is terrible. Admittedly, I live in a fringe area but the old Sanyo 8100 worked just fine on the Sprint network. Even bought external antenna to improve reception and stop dropped calls but did no better. Ready to sell and start over."
3,"Excellent PDA phone, but not very durable","I've used the treo 270 (flip up top) and the treo 600. I really like the 600 with all the palm features and programs that can be downloaded to the phone.With the 270, the flip up top broke off when it dropped from the kitchen counter to the floor. And now my 600 dropped from my hand to the floor(about 3 feet)and won't work any more. For such an expensive phone, it should be manufactured to be more durable."
1,Ugh...stay away,"I bought the phone from verizon and had to replace it 3 times in the first 4 months. Phone kept restarting and disconnecting when I inserted a hands free ear/mic. Design for hand free is bad...never fits well. Sound quality is bad.I would say you get what you pay for. The PDA is nice and all, and web feature is great if you don't mind a $120+ bill each month. Still for $150 the phone part is terrible. Now I'm stuck with it for another 18 months. UGHBuyers beware!"
2,my treo,"i am not satisfied with my phone bec i can't maximize the features and i cant open my web. i tried to use the cd that comes with it but the serial number on the phone doesnt match. its not registered yet bec of this serial #. The silicon case i received is wrong, you sent me the one for 650, my unit is 600. i'l apreciate if you send me the right one. Thank you."
4,"clear information, good for pratice.","I have studied from this IELTS book and have learned many things from it. The details of each section of the test are provided clearly. Answers are given for each section. The CD-Rom also gives good preparation for listening.Overall, the IELTS Tutor book and CD-Rom makes IELTS test easy to me. I recommend this book for the test writers who would like to achieve their desired IELTS band score."
1,I am very dissappointed!,This is only a IELTS introduction vedio with a small booklet. There is no excercise questions at all. I am very dissappointed!
5,Great video. Very helpful,This video and book you must study. The best section is the writing which gave me many helpful things I can remember to pass. Also good reading tips and many speach helping ideas.
4,how the photographic essay is created,how the photographic essay is created with a biop of w. eugen smith. taking several of his photo essays and breaking down how each was created is a journey into the mind of the photojournalist
4,I liked it,This was a nice movie to watch. I like the fact that they broke away from the standard where the hero gets the girl. It was tastefull. I wonder when the sequel will be out?
3,It Was Okay,"I didn't like this movie as much as everyone else. I thought the character of Captain America was interesting and Chris Evans was good, but the story was really jokey. Hugo Weaving was a good villain and I hope he comes back in ""The Avengers,"" but how many more Nazi movies do I have to watch? Oh, sorry. Hydra movies?"
4,IF YOU LOVE THE COMIC BOOK MOVIES,"It is another installment in the comic book heros coming to the big screen. Not awesome, but Chris is gorgeous so it was fun to watch. Liked the era appropriate settings and clothing . . . neat to see."
2,Took too long to ship!!,"I ordered from 3 different company's online on a Thurday, 2 of the company's shipped out my order the next day-Friday, buy YOU guys didn't ship out my order-(even though it was in stock) until Monday! And this was 3 weeks before the holiday season started! What happened on Friday?? Take the day off???? Slow service is a deal breaker. I'll shop elsewhere from now on."
2,"No Plot, Overly Simplistic; Dumb","Much like the Thor movie, I worry that my IQ has dropped several points after watching this. The plot is overly simplistic and the movie is more a montage of action scenes than anything else. The movie experience of today would be much more fun if only writers would start adding some depth and complexity to their plots. Great movie for the kids, though."
3,More than a bit hokey,"Slow developing plot requires you suspend all belief in physics, genetics, technological capabilities, .... Not at all what I expected based on the promos and hype, and not worth the money IMHO."
3,boring at times!,"its way too long at some scenes. a comic should be a bit more agile and I almost fall asleep watching this. overall for $4 bucks its a decent entertainment, but boy i'm happy that I did not pay a movie theater ticket for this..."
3,The hero in everyman,"He was always Capt. America, at least in spirit. He started out as the classic 98-pound weakling, then had his body scientifically bulked up to match his spirit. It resonates with the little kid in anyone that wants to be looked up to.Then, it takes place during WWII, the last war that Americans generally supported. It becomes clear early on that the war isn't against Germans as Germans, but against a specific group out for world domination - something that appeals to today's more carefully targeted kind of enmity. From there, it moves forward in an utterly earnest way, as if no one had ever heard of irony. Or much in the way of humor, either - after the wise-cracking Tony Stark ofIron Man, this comes across a bit bland. Tommy Lee Jones does what he can to pull this one along, but the movie's sodden weight seems too much even for him.On the whole, it's a more than adequate comic movie, but not one I'll be coming back to.-- wiredweird, reviewing the releast to theaters"
3,Glad I waited for the DVD...,"OK, I know it's based on comic book...but the characters in this movie are such central casting cardboard cut-outs that even cardboard boxes can't suspend disbelief.Lots of derivatives here: exotic Nazi's/supervillians (paging Dr. Jones...paging Dr. Jones) with super-technology that they are too evil to understand in exotic lairs. Underdog American GIs ready to give them what for. Personal transformations, explosions, hints of romance...And an ending that features multi-generational time-shifting and the promise of future sequels with other Marvel characters.I wouldn't want to have parted with full cinema cost for this...but not bad for a rental on a quiet and cold winter night."
2,My 2 cents,"I wanted to love this movie because well....it's Cpt. America! But I was disappointed rather quickly...I'm not sure if this is just me but I felt like the movie was rushed after the first 30 minutes of the movie, that the plot moved faster and did less to captivate the audience. The biggest disappointment has to be the end fight that the movie builds up immensely only to have it be very brief. What a terrible ending! I honestly could not understand people's obsession with this movie. I realize it is Cpt. America and it is somewhat patriotic but if you make that argument then our country deserves better. Do yourself a favor and rent this or wait till it is dirt cheap to see it."
4,the real story behind Captain America from inception,this movie traces the Captain from his birth in World War II until modern days. it shows the captain as he travels through time with his belief in America keeping him company as a super patriot and a believer in right and wrong and the American way fighting Facism in the 40's until today.
5,DVD,This was a gift for my Grandaughter. No complaints so I'm assuming it was OK..She had asked for this for her Birthday
5,Really good movie,"A really good movie in the Marvel Avenger movie series. Saw this movie on the big screen and loved it. Probably watched movie at least 4 times. Once again, way to go Stan Lee and the team. You guys do really well at bring these guys to the big screen straight from the comics."
1,Action Movie Junkie,"I actually hate this movie. I seen this movie in theaters and it was a complete waste of my time. I felt like it was rushed, the movies had little action, the story-line was terrible. I got bored and wanted to leave the theater. So happy I did not pay money to see this movie. I honestly don't understand why people gave this movie 5 Stars. Ridiculous. If I could give it no stars I would."
2,Well. Let's see here.,"I've seen all the spidey movies. The old batman and Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy. Also seen Great super hero anime movies like Hulk vs. and the batman anime movies along with the punisher war zone, thor, Blade's movies, arnold's movies (all of them, action that is), Matrix, Transporter 1 and 2, Michael Jai White action flicks, the list goes on. I'm a big action and i have a very large movie collection. I must say though that this movie just doesn't do it for me. It seemed boring, kind of slow, just didn't have enough/much action in it and what was there was not that big of a deal. Really. My friend likes it and i don't see why. The story is really nothing to get excited about and isn't what you would call captivating. I rate this by far 2.5 out of 5 stars. To be honest, on my first watch i couldn't even finish it it was that weak. Maybe 3 stars, but check out all the other ones first or buy them. They are worth you time and money. Check out my Listmania's"
1,!!!CRUMMY MOVIE!!!,"Captain America wasn't worth the $8.25!! Even as a fan of Super-Hero movies, this wasn't good at all. The action scenes were brief and predictable. No good fight scenes, predictable and uninteresting plot, my friend even fell asleep! The action scenes were all the same: Captain America running through Nazis and punching them in the face, then moving on to the next. THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS JUST A PROMO FOR MARVEL'S NEXT MOVIE: THE AVENGERS."
3,"Decent, but coul've been better","Captain America: The First Avenger culminated what I call ""The Summer of Superheroes"", though not at all in the way I had hoped it would. It's a decent flick, but it takes forever to get going. I spent the entire first half of the movie pleading for it to pick up the pace and then when it finally did, I was disappointed because it ramped up the action, but then seemed to resolve the conflict too quickly, leaving the ending to be a complete disaster. As far as the cast is concerned, I thought Chris Evans did a fine job as Steve Rogers / Cap and I loved Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Phillips. I also really liked Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. Hayley Atwell was OK, but didn't really stand out at all and Hugo Weaving did the best he could with the material he was given. Overall, a decent movie, though certainly not Marvel's best as it lacks a solid story and in-depth character development, but it's worth a rent at the very least."
5,Captain America,Great movie. Great cast. Great story. Acting entirely copacetic with the story. More words as required. Especially loved the female cast.
2,Worked ok,worked ok then after 4th watch it stopped working.. I have a brand new dvd player so this product was not in good shape
5,Capt. America DVD,It's a great movie. I loved the Avengers movie that I saw in the theater and Capt. America was a prelude movie. I enjoyed learning the history of capt. America.
5,Captain America,Great movie!! I grew up reading the comic books and must say it is very cool to see all heroes of my youth coming to life on the big screen. Marvel has done a wonderful job with the animation and making things move along with the way the stories were told. great job! I would recommend this and all the other Marvel and DC movies!
5,As with Ironman this was also a great movie.,Rest assured this DVD will be kept in a good location so it can be watched agian and agian. There are no bad comets about this movie.
2,I want full screen movies,"I almost like this movie, but not worth buying if not in full screen. I paid way too much money on my tv to look at the black bar top and bottom to buy movies ""Sorry Charlie""."
1,Insomniacs gather 'round!,"If you have trouble sleeping,....then try to watch this snooze bore fest. I LOVE COMIC BOOK MOVIES. This one is HORRIBLY boreing. Watch it, then get a good nights sleep."
1,really dissapointing,"I saw this movie in theaters in 3D, and I have to say, I swore never to see another movie in 3D after this. Unlike Avatar, the use of 3D adds nothing to the viewing experience. The acting wasn't really a problem for me. However, I was expecting the action to be the best part of the movie, but what I got was a collection of 60 second action snap shots (the focus of which should have been the majority of the movie). Lastly, the Nazi character (the bad guy) is just way too over-the-top to watch. I found his character extremely annoying. I guess I was hoping for Iron Man (the first not the second) but instead I just got a really slow, bad Hollywood movie."
5,Epic America,"WOW, what a great movie to watch on a pizza night.Great character development. I would recommend this movie for a large range of different ages. THis opinion is from a fifteen year old."
4,Captain America!,"This movie was okay to me. I liked the action and story of how a weak and scrawny guy with a kind heart got the body that he wanted and the job to save America from the Germans. In fact, I even liked every bit until the ending. I am confused as to why he ended up in the situation he ended up in (I don't want to give it away..) and whether or not they will make a sequel. I mean, they can't just leave him like that, can they?Rent it. I wouldn't buy it :)"
3,It was ... average.,"I'll admit Captain America had an interesting premise but the delivery was pretty average. There were a lot of explosions and fight scenes and not enough back story or even tension within the characters. Schmidt wanted world domination. That's it. He was too simple. Rogers was too straight up of a good guy to have much depth. And agent Peggy Clark was not very interesting either. To put it straight: I became more interested in my Cheddar flavored popcorn than the movie. It could have been much better. --Sherry Gripman, Author"
5,Captain America,"The best movie in the Avenger Series, so far!I especially liked the preview for next year's Avenger movie, and look forward to owning that BlueRay."
5,amazing,excellent condition and amazing effects....good viewing for the family....good story line up and good cast .... .... ..... ..... ......
5,the best of the series,"loved the movie, and even better on blu-ray. the story really makes the film. I liked the character and his sense of duty"
4,surprisingly good,I was pleasently surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining and this may be the best acting I've seen Chris Evans do. Stanley Tucci gave his customary high standard performance. Dominic Cooper was enaging as he Howard Hughes'est Howard Stark. Hayley Atwell was forgettable.
5,Great,"Movie was in great shape, shipped fast, got it here in time for Christmas, sister was very pleased. No scratches or damages!"
5,Chris Evans need I say more.,"Good story line, nice set up for related movies, Iron Man, Avengers, etc. Great visuals and did I mention Chris Evans?!!!"
5,Finally a Decent Captain America Movie!,"After viewing various cheesy Captain America Movies throughout the decades, I am sure that this one was a breath of fresh air! I was about to give up and admit that Hollywood simply cannot release a decent Captain America movie but they finally done it! This movie is wonderful. It is well made, strong story, special effects and all the shebang! I have been collecting super hero comic books and movies since childhood (only DC and Marvel) and this one surely is one of my top picks. I strongly recommend this one to all the collectors out there."
4,Ready for the Avengers,This is my favorite movie of all the Avenger series. I am looking forward to the movie coming in the summer.
5,Great film,"Not gonna go on about how good the movie is. The movie looks and sounds awesome. Love the sound fx on all the Hydra weapons, sound is amazing on a 5.1 setup! GET IT!"
4,"Suriprisingly, my favorite of the Marvel comic book movies.","Perhaps the best done installment of the Marvel franchise since ""X2: United""! I expected a throwaway action movie, but was very pleasantly surprised by the quality. Give 'er a spin."
1,Worst movie of the Year,"Literally the worst movie I've seen in past five years. Maybe a 5-year old kid would like it. There is no plot. There is no story. This movie is so poorly made its ridiculous. And the bad guy has a red face, so unrealistic. I give this movie zero stars."
1,upset with amizon!,"I was unable to watch the movie because it never loaded. Originally said it would load in 2hrs then continued to 3, 4, 5, then 6hrs and never did load. Very upset w/amizon! Still got charged!"
4,Mark Blake is off his rocker,"First off, to Mark Blake, the guy with the review at the beginning above...you are obviously not a metal fan. Piece of Mind ""treads water""?????? Yeah right. That's the most innaccurate statements I've ever heard. Arguably every song on Piece of Mind is a ferocious rocker. Where Eagles Dare, Flight of Icarus, Die with your Boots on, The Trooper, Quest for Fire...oh yeah, those songs tread water. Moron. This first Maiden album is great too. Different sound. DiAnno is much more raw, and with far less vocal range than Bruce (one of the best singers in all of metal.) But there are some truly classic tunes on this, and, as you'll find throughout the entire Maiden catalog, fantastic guitar. You need every Maiden album (except the Blaze stuff) if you're a true fan of metal. Hail the reunion!!!!!"
3,good start but just the begining,"Ok, lets face it, this is good, but embrionic Maiden, Paul is good but Iron Maiden became great with Bruce"
3,IRON MAIDEN,PROWLER-7/10REMEMBER TOMORROW-4/10RUNNING FREE-6/10PHANTOM OF THE OPERA-8/10TRANSYLVANIA-5/10STRANGE WORLD-5/10SANCTUARY-4/10CHARLOTTE THE HARLOT-6/10IRON MAIDEN-7/10
5,Great Debut!,"We all know the Bruce Dickinson Iron Maiden era was the big one, but lets not forget how great Paul Di'Anno's asset to Iron Maiden was! That guy rocked in one of the best debut albums ever! This is a must for any Iron Maiden fan!"
4,MAY-DEN! MAY-DEN! MAY- DEN!!!,"Iron Maiden helped invent metal in the late seventies. This album is a collection of recordings from the earliest days of Maiden with original front man Paul Dianno.This was their first official album. I find this album to be incredible and one of the definitions of HEAVY METAL. This is before the flamboyant wails of BRUCE DICKINSON, the focus is way more on the guitars. Paul Dianno is way more low key. His image was much different. This is what I like. Though, I like Bruce, this album and KILLERS is REAL METAL. BANGIN' DIRTY CHICKS WITHOUT A CONDOM METAL! YEAH! DRINKIN WHISKEY OUT HE BOTTLE AND WASHIN' IT DOWN WITH MORE WHISKEY METAL! YEAH!Just listen to PHANTOM OF THE OPERA you'll understand.RUNNIN FREE, CHARLOTTE THE HARLOTT, the eerie ballad STRANGE WORLD are honorable mentions. THIS ALBUM ROCKS AS DOES KILLERS!"
4,So It Begins...,"The future kings of metals debut has some amazing songs. ""Sanctuary"", ""Running Free"", ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""Transylvania"", and ""Strange World"" are all great songs. The guitars are good, with Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton trading licks, and the bass is good as it will always be (bow to Steve Harris). Vocalist Paul Di'Anno does great on the album as well.This is a great album, however there is one problem, and it is the reason I gave the album 4 instead of 5 stars: The production is very muddled. Steve Harris (bassist & leader) himself doesn't think the album is as good as it could have be because of the production. They would get the production on the next album, however..."
5,Awesome...Totally Awesome FAST METAL,"This album makes me have a god-@#$% orgasm it's that good. Its fast as hell and is a prototype for thrash/speed metal of the 80's. Every song rules especially transylvania and Iron Maiden. The musicianship on this album is outstanding. Tell me that any current guitarists possess this kind of talent. And if they do then why aren't they releasing albums this good? Because the level of quality here is untouchable by all but the best. Hey buddy, I want you to buy this album. If you don't like it I'LL give you your money back. Buy it NOW!! you pukes!! Do it before I rip you head off and @#$% down your neck. Trust me, you'll love this masterpiece."
1,"Good content, but...",This book is good for learning about Fiber Optics for a beginner. My disappointment comes mostly from Amazon. The book arrived with a torn cover and damaged binding. The pages inside look as though they were photo copied. Not the quality I expected for $131. I'd return it but I need it for a class that I'm currently taking. Skip buying this from Amazon directly and try one of the private sellers.
4,Great gift!,"This is a great gag gift for someone. However, I can't recommend it as a ""quality"" fork. I probably wouldn't even eat off of it but it is a very funny gift!"
3,Good Family Film,"Awkward little boy in WWII era America and his relationship with his peppy dog (Eddie from TV's Frasier). Probably better for adults than small kids, and have a hankie handy. Subplot involving two dangerous bootleggers almost derail the movie into Home Alone territory."
1,Horrible,"This movie mad me cry so much it made me mad. If you are a really big dog lover, this is not the movie for you.Sure, at first it is promising with the cute dog messing around, but then it gets depressing.No fun at all in this movie."
1,Huge letdown,"I can't understand all of the good reviews for this film, which I found to be a huge disappointment. Bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. The film obviously tried to capitalize on Muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. There is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent ""uplifting"" family film, opt for ""The Sandlot."""
5,best pet movie ever,"I love pet movies, especially dogs. Since I reside with a Jack Russell, this one was a particular joy. It was a wonderful, loving, tear-jerker of a movie and reminded me of all the dogs I've had the honor to share a life with. I relived my childhood growing up with a dog in my life and this movie was a reminder of my past. Lovely story, wonderful filming and an outstanding cast. A must have for anyones collection. (warning, it may be upsetting for very young children)"
5,A Road worth going down,"New to Korean language and culture and not really sure where I should start from, a friend recommended Harris' ""Roadmap to Korean"" last month and I haven't looked back since. As I prepare to work in Seoul this coming fall, I feel so much more ready and educated to work and live in Korea after reading through my ""Roadmap"". Moving from Confucianism to the Chinese Zodiac all the while infusing easy-to-understand explanations of the workings of Korean, this book is my bible as I prepare for my Korean experience. Thanks, Mr. Harris!!"
4,I love this CD!!,"Hey, I thought this CD was awesome, sooo much better than Spice!! My fave song is Stop, it is just too catchy!! I LOVE SCARY'S HAIR!!"
3,Spiceworld could have been a lot better!!!,"I am a great fan of the Spice Girls mainly because of their first album. I expected the second to be a whole lot better. I consider this entire cd a big adveritesment. The whole cd was an ad for their movie spiceworld, ""Do It"" was like an ad for NIKE, and ""Move Over"", which should be called ""Generation Next"" was an ad for PEPSI."
5,Best Movie of All Time! Girl Power!,"As expected, the Spice Girls put out the best movie ever! It's so funny, and the Spice Girls great personalities add to it. The colorful outfits, and great music make this movie even better! 5 stars! 10! 2 thumbs up! Girl Power!"
2,Boring!,"I thought that this video was not very well done and not professional, well that's unauthorized so you won't see much of the Spice Girls in there talking but you hear a little bit about them but it's nothing new. It was a very boring documentary, the only funny part was the Drag Queens as the Spice Girls!"
1,Why did they make this film,"I hated the Spice Girls before this movie and then I hated them even more after I saw it.Stupid,boring and dull only a child under the age of 10 would like this huge mess."
1,Don't even bother.,This movie has no point. This movie is also boring. I though this movie was going to be good but it ended to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I was very disapointed. If there were -100 on the scale I would give it that.
3,CLASSIC!,This was a movie I got for my daughters friend and she loves it! To remind you she is 13 and enjoys the lovable and light hearted movie!
1,The World's Worst Movie,Spiceworld was the absolutely worst movie I have ever seen. It has no plot and only shows 5 losers running around making fools of themselves and being an embarrasment to Britain.
4,Live and Let Spice,"It was good to see Roger Moore, no longer James Bond 007, in a film again. This time he plays a character that looks very much like his nemesis Blofeld. Instead of a cat he now keeps a pig in his lap. Very cool idea! As with David Lean's DOCTOR ZHIVAGO it is about a few years in the turbulent life of the all-female Anglo-Soviet assembly. The Spy and Spice Girls have plenty of character, and that helps make up for the lack of action and adventure that keeps their movie debut from being a truly epic motion picture. The concert scene at Albert Hall in London was very reminiscent of Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It was kind of a 90's version on some of his themes as well as David Lean's and those of the Bond producers. However, it has a potential of being cult epic like AUSTIN POWERS. Perhaps not. Perhaps time will be kind to these spicy gals."
5,Viva Les SPICEs...,this album sold 18 millions copies and it was their second #1 album..the fantasy is waitng for you in this album...
3,It's Okay!,"If you are a fan of the Spice Girls your may like this movie. The script is kind of boring and the acting performance of the girls are not great, just okay, well they acting like themself but Geri (Ginger Spice) My God she CAN'T act! She can't sing also, what she's doing in a girls band and now in an movie??? Well she do have charisma and good stage presence, she is an interesting person, I guess that mostly why she is in the Spice Girls, she is driven but she sure can't sing, I sing better then her and I think I sing bad.lol:) Well like I said if you like the Spice Girls you may like this movie, it got funny part in it but it's not the movie of the year."
2,Let down...,"I saw this movie when it first came out, a few years ago. That was when I was a HUGE Spice Girl fan, and would do anything to see them. I looked over the faults of the movie and just saw the movie because of them. Okay, well here's the lowdown:Plot: Simple, stupid, and it's kind of like an everyday thing. They try to get to this concert on time, it's pretty lame.Characters: THe characters the Spice Girls portray are themselves, and unless you don't know the Spice Girls, then you won't get how the act.The Acting Itself: It's not very good, like compared to the GOOD actors, i.e. Tom Hanks, Gwenyth Paltrow, etc... But it is suprising that they can act... somewhat.So then does Spice World deserve 2 stars? 1 star means it's completely lame. 2 stars means that it's on the edge of lame, but it's not good enough to be okay. It might appeal to people who younger, or are completely obsessed with the Spice Girls."
5,if only i was one of their lovers!,"they're hot, they're sexy, they're the spice girls! the spice girls are going to be remembered for a long time, now, not only for their music, but also for their acting. This film is great! i love it! it's so funny, and it shows some stuff about the spice girls that people don't know. i recomend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh, it's great!"
2,"Two stars for ""Viva Forever""","The Spice girls can definetly dance and sing. But their songs are just so dull. ""Spice up your life"" is decent, and ""Viva Forever"" is excellent but the other songs just don't cut it. They don't suck, but they just make you want to find the better songs, which are scarce. The girls do have a lot of rhythm, but they need more then just two winning songs on their cds. They all show great potential, but an album with mostly filler really doesn't cut it. I think the girls are good songwriters, but they could pick up a lot of tips from Madonna, Alannis Morisette, or Celine Dion. I understand that those three are very different songwriters than the spice girls, but they all know how to right great music. One last thing. Get Victoria up there singing more. She has an awesome low voice and that girl is hot!!"
2,Trash music,"What makes this actually worse than 'Spice' is that there is not actually one decent song here. Very dumb lyrics (we moonwalk the foxtrot, then polka the salsa), dreadful singing, totally unoriginal, this heavily commercialised CD is an earsore. I can understand why younger listeners love 'Spice', perhaps, but not this."
1,These 5 star reviews are making me sick!,"That pretty much says it. The Spice Girls are the worst band in history, period. Someone said how good their concerts are, HA HA! like i'd ever go to a concert to see this band live! They actually came to my town once, and only about 25 people went! I think that's because they understand that the Spice Girls were made for people who can't handle real life. The person who knows how to throw a good concert, my friend, is BONEY JAMES!"
2,Roger Ebert Was Right,"I totally agreed with what Roger Ebert said on how this was one of the worst of 1998. I don't see how anyone could like this. Was so special about it? Nothing. It was completey unfunny. All I remember was the stupid stuff. Lucky me I don't remember much else. This is soooooo overated. It had lots of cheesy gags. Like when one of the Spice Girls went in a phone booth and turned into an old man(don't ask) and that spoof of SPEED that was so bad. Has its moments, but otherwise just for Spicegirls fans."
1,waste of money,This movie has a man asking everyone on the streets if they like the spice girls. Thats it. and a drag queen performance at the end with muted singing. I guess thats what they mean by unauthorized.
4,Crazy stickers,I bought this for my daughetrs christmas this year we had no problems putting the truck together but however I had a lot of trouble getting the sticker off one of the trucks doors we tryed a lot of things but just keep smering everywear I was very disappointed about working for a least 20 minutes now trying to scrap it off without messing it up and putting no scaches on it but no luck yet hopefully we can get it off if anyone has any ideas to get the sticker off let me know please and by the way has anyone else that bought this truck have you had the same problem with the sticker issue? Overall this is a great truck
5,Outstanding,This toy makes you want to be a kid again. We laughed so hard watching the kids ride this over the bumps in the grass on the neighbors yard. Don't stand in front of this toy!!!
5,Great 80's Brit rock!!,"Eclectic British sound from a dying era. These guys re-surged on 2000's for a spell, but are best remembered from the past."
5,So Pretty,I bought 2 complete place settings of this pattern for my parents for Christmas last year and they loved it so much they bought two more dinner plates. Then this year I got them two more salad plates to extend their collection. I love the birds and the detail of the branches & ribbon.
5,Best Pooh Toy!,My daughter absolutely loves this interactive Pooh toy. It is ideal when traveling to bring a piece of home wherever you go. Doesn't take long for them to learn that pressing Pooh's hunny pot gets him to sing! I find myself humming his little song at work and it makes me smile. Great buy! Great value! Came with batteries and are still going after 4mths of daily use.
4,"Excellent, smooth vibe","I bought this record when it came out, listened to it endlessly, and am just now rediscovering it. I just love the vibe on this record. I had forgotten how much it had sunk in. The ""Portrait of Tracy"" sample on ""Who's Listening"" has forever changed the way I hear Jaco Pastorius. I strongly suggest this CD if you can find it."
3,An OK mixer,"I purchased this mixer when my older one (identical model) died after about 10 years of service. I loved my older one and never had a problem with it. The new one, however, has a sitcky ""burst of power"" button. When you push it in, it takes a while for it to return to its original position once released. Until it is back in its original position you cannot turn off the mixer! A bit frutrating and potentially messy! I still love the ""burst of power"" feature and would probably look into the newer style Sunbeam is makeing that has the ""burst of power"" button separate from the speed selector switch."
3,Least favorite Mallery book,"Didnt care for this one. Among other things, Christie is 4 but was described much like a 6 year old. It just didn't fit."
1,Bits of metal is not what I want with my cheese,"At first I was pretty happy with the grater, but after a few days of use I started to notice that I was getting small shavings of metal as well as shredded cheese. I am no longer using it and would not recomend it to anyone."
1,Save your money,"I bought this to replace my old Mouli grater which finally bit the dust. Big mistake. It is sturdy and reasonably well designed, but the grating surfaces barely work at all, or at least mine didn't. To get it to grate cheese takes a long time and a lot of muscle, so much so that you are likely to start wondering how badly you really want the grated cheese. I tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh Parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on Jarlsberg. Neither drum worked satisfactorily. That may be because it is made in China where hard western-style cheese is nearly unknown. Yeah I know it says MIU France but the box clearly says ""Made in China"". I finally got so mad I threw it out in frustration."
3,not what i thought,It works great but there isn't a beater brush for carpets. Great for cleaning the vehicles and the camper and water pick up.
4,good but not the best,"This one is a good show case of there tallent, but it was lacking the energy that live after death has. Bruce is not at his best in some of the old songs(run to the hills, number of the beast)and is sounding like he would rather play more new stuff.the best song on it is the clairvoyant."
5,Country Joe Zen,This timeless classic soothed my weary heart when the war looked like it would go on forever; it remains a neverending tribute to the spirit of the soldiers for peace. Priceless.
3,Book was good... editing is poor,"I really enjoy this author, and I enjoyed the story. Unfortunately, the grammatical issues and spelling errors in some cases make some parts of the reading annoying. The story did keep me guessing, and I did enjoy the suspense of it all."
5,Must Have For Any Worship Leader,"This is the best and most practical book I've ever read on being a worship leader. It not only details song selection, writing songs, working with the band and their job descriptions, but puts emphasis on your relationship with God. It also emphasises the communication between WL and pastor which is key. I've gone to this book when in a dilemma and thought, ""Oh I know what chapter I need!"" I've given away several and have just purchased another copy for myself. I've read it backwards and fowards three (3) times so far."
1,"avoid, poor quality blade","item delivered on April 6th, return initiated on April 21stafter 1 chicken (only used to process chicken), it did not cut properly the second one. At the third one, the blade no longer cuts, but tears/lacerates skin and meat. Poor quality knife."
1,Very disappointed with this knife,"We own several older Chicago Cutlery knives and have been satisfied with them. So when we were looking for a modestly priced 8"" chef's knife, based on previous experience and the reviews, the Centurion looked like a good value. I am very disappointed with this knife. It was dull out of the package and could not successfully cut Swiss chard from our garden. I sharpened it, which improved its performance, but it could still not make a clean cut. I switched to a Henckels International Classic 6"" utility knife, which cut the chard easily and cleanly. If I can return this knife, I will. Certainly, we will not buy from the Chicago Cutlery Centurion line again and will stick with Henckels or Wusthof."
4,The original action game,"For those who remember McDonalds in styrofome, freezer sized microwaves and Vans, you will remember the fun you had from the first time you grabbed your paddle and tried to get that ball bouncing around as your points racked up. A great piece of history for those who want to introduce new generations to the gaming system that truly started it all."
1,USHistoryTeacher,"I purchased this video to use in my 8th grade classroom. It is more akin to a Power Point presentation. I could not imagine using it in its entirety with students. I may use one or two ""slides."" I was bored to death, and I love U.S. History."
3,Not as good as I thought,"First the good news. The author knows his science very well. The bad news is he does a poor job of blending the theme of religion's effect on the science of astronomy. Religious persecution was, and still is, a great hinderence in the scientific community. The author's "" I'm o.k. you're o.k."" approach to this problem left me cold."
3,The Caring Side of War,"The Other Side of War was required reading for my college Civil War class. I was apprehensive about the book and put off reading it until the last minute expecting it to be as exciting as a trip to the dentist. It actually was quite informative. It had a lot of details that needed to be sifted through, but for a person living on steamboats, caring for men with typhoid fever, I found Kathleen to be completely satisfied and seldomly unhappy with her surroundings. The book is a composition of letters, so it is also a bit choppy, but it clearly depicts the story of a woman during the Civil War Era. It is worth reading if you really want to see the different ways people reacted to the war which tore our country apart."
2,I know it's a classic but...,"I really did not like it. Hard to keep up with, the characters and storylines are way too numerous and disjointed. Didn't end up finishing it and I'm an avid reader."
2,"Long, Boring, and Tedious","I really didn't like this book at all. I'm a classic literature reader, which is why I picked it up in the first place. It was my first Dickens novel, and I was so disappointed. To me, it seemed to be more about those darn criminals than anything. Judging from this book, I don't like Dickens' style of writing: too wordy, unclear, and imprecise. I swear, the guy could go on for pages talking about a piece of wood if he had to. I got so bored, the words just started slurring together after a while. However, its story about how a boy of poverty becomes rich in so many other aspects is quite touching. But the journey of getting to that point is LONG, BORING, and too TEDIOUS for me to stand. Possibly, if I were a boy, I could relate to this book more. I would, however, recommend this book to anyone who likes a drug-out mystery."
3,"Great writing but a cold, ugly and cruel world that I do not want to revisit",Of course I generally knew this story but I had actually never read Charles Dickens before. I guess it was time and I looked forward to reading this classic. I sure was disappointed because I hadn't realized how depressing it was. Dickens' England was not a kind and gentle place. It was cold and ugly and many people were very cruel. The story was sad and my heart went out to the poor orphan Oliver. But he was not the only one who lived a sad life. All the characters were caught up in a web of unpleasantness and cruelty was everywhere.O.K. Dickens is a fine writer and I understand how his works have met the test of time. But life is just too short for me to try to read any Dickens again.
3,Difficult Read.,"Dickens writes like a lawyer. His sentences are very long and their structure is complex. The book was so difficult to read that I could not enjoy it. I wish I could have, the characters were very colorful, the story was interesting enough and I really enjoyed the sarcasm and irony.I did not enjoy the movie/musical either."
3,The Age Range Is Wrong!!,"We are a homeschooling family, and we try to read the classics whenever we can. So far, I have been able to find the great books (like Gulliver's Travels, Moby Dick- even Les Miserable!) written at 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade reading levels. We ordered this particular book because of the age range listed in the product's details. At the time, there was no ""Look Inside"" feature for this book. This book is NOT for a 9 or 10 year old. The vocabulary (acquiescence, unpropitious, jocosity, supplication, assiduously- just to name a FEW) is too difficult, not to mention the unfamiliar British colloquialisms, Dickens' run-on prose, and the couple of CURSE WORDS! I'm not criticizing the original work, I'm just stating that the original work is not suitable for most of the 9-12 year-old age range. A re-told version for this reading level (even a Cliff's Notes) would be more suitable if you are interested in introducing the classics to your kids."
1,Lost Interest due to lengthy time gap between episodes,I enjoyed the first download but the time gap between downloads was so great that I was off reading other things. Even after two weeks I have not gotten back to finishing the book. I'm really unsure that the rest of the book will be there for me to read. It seems that your playing a game with me that I don't really want to play.
3,"Story is a classic, but Kindle version freezes","I am not one to review an item for things like shipping, etc. instead of the actual story, but Oliver Twist is a known classic and good story. So I want to review the Kindle eBook version which constantly freezes my new Kindle when other books do not. I am 60% through and it has frozen at least 100 times, making me need to skip ahead several page clicks and then backtrack 1-5 pages to where I was. This freezing also happens when using the dictionary. This ebook was free so it is not the end of the world, but I get frustrated with it on nearly every page and chose to take a break from this book for a few days. I think it has some bugs that Amazon needs to look into."
5,I loved this book!,"I picked this book up at my local library for a book report. Since I am 14, I didn't expect to really enjoy this book, but I had heard so much about it so I decided to read it. Once I had read the book, I was surprised at how much I liked it! I could not put this book down. There were numerous occasions where I kept wondering what would happen next. I was surprised by the murder. I guess I kind of saw it coming though since Sikes seems as if he has it in him. The trials Oliver goes through in this book really make you think. I was disappointed by Mr. Bumble. He treated Oliver as if he weren't human. All in all, I enjoyed the characters. I give 5 stars to Dickens for writing this novel. He has made me an admirer of his books. Now I truly know why he is such a great author. Everyone should experience this book!"
4,Great Book,"Good ~ Great book, love the artists renditions of select scenes and *especially* love the footnotes with the explainations to some of the most purplexing of British slang... very handy interpretaions.Could be improved ~ How about some chapters on top/bottom of pages?"
3,Oliver Twist describes social problems in Victorian England.,"Dicken's novel,Oliver Twist, is a stinging commentary on the class system of Victorian England. The author uses the protagonist, a young orphan,as an archetypical victim of the growing influence of the middle class and its intolerance of the poor. Although Dickens's use of the novel as a vehicle to express his opinion of the social conditions of the time, his writings are extremely drawn out and can sometimes be difficult for the reader to comprehend the plot of the novel. Overall, Oliver Twist gives its readers a valuable insight into the author's view of Victorian England, but one should read the book thoroughly to understand its context."
1,Disappointed in Serials,"I was looking forward to reading this story in ""episodes"". A lot of people here were complaining about the long wait time, but I used to wait a week for podiobook chapters and figured this would be like that.However, when I downloaded the book, it downloaded all released chapters at once! Now the experience is ruined for me. At the very least, Amazon, give the user a choice to download the next chapter early rather than ruin the serial experience by lumping everything together."
4,"Sweet memories of youth, somewhat disturbed","At last mine again, after almost 3 years of search (this Burdon masterpiece has already been part of my vinyl collection in the 70's), it brought back all the sweet memories of the late sixties - only disturbed by some strange re-naming of tracks (psychedelic ""Orange and Red Beams"" replaced by the somewhat more material ""Oranges and Red Beans"") and the lack of the original date of issue. No traces of remastering have been left on the CD - though this would have been a clear advantage."
5,Best example of Eric's talents,"This has always rated as one of my all time faves. Each time I listen to this I gain a new respect for the talent of this man and his band. The lyrics of ""No Self Pity"" are some of the most powerful he ever sang,relevant to this day."
1,A REALLY DEAD ONE !,"For Christ's sake ! THis band, one of my all-times favourites, practically finished after the album ""SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON"" ! THe only good point in this live CD is that at least there are only songs from the albuns recorded before that! But the mixing is absurdly poor, the band is playing lkike if they don't care."
1,Abhorrent failure rate,"I go through a spindle every few weeks, so I've used just about every brand. I bought these Sony's for the first time a week ago, and I can say without a doubt I have never had more discs error during the burn process. Approximately 65% of my burns have failed with these. This is not at all what I've come to expect from this company."
1,The worst cdrs I have experienced,"Do not buy! The first 4 cdr's I attempted to burn all failed or were unreadable in a player. Now I'm stuck because Target won't take back.Stick with Memorex,TDK ect.... I would have given it zero stars if that were possible."
1,Do not buy Sony ... save your money,"I've burned a lot of CDs over the years and it came time to buy a new stack. I went to the story and ended up buying a Sony stack because I thought they'd be good because they had the Sony name. I hadn't read any of the reviews before buying them.Plain and simple, they are terrible. I've burned 6 CDs or so and every single one has failed. I've burned other CDs in the same exact method that have worked fine. The Sony's just do not work. Terrible, terrible product. I feel completely ripped off that I paid for these CDs. I've learned that even Sony can rip you off. I need to check reviews for EVERYTHING before I buy them. I have no problems with Imation CDs."
4,Odd reviews,I have boycotted all Sony products in my home since the release of the PS3. These are the only exception. I have been using Sony 700MB CD-R's since I started burning and I am on my second 50 disc spindle. I buy them from Target. I have 2 failures. They burn as I would expect them to. Flawless.
1,TERRIBLE - the worst I've ever used,"Success rate was less than 50% using a system known to deliver above 90% using competitive manufacturers' media (Imation, AT&T; brands).DON'T BUY THESE!!! Save your money and time: buy another brand."
5,excellent bebop drum book,"this is a great book for practicing your bebop style of drumming, the best one I've seen, 5 stars"
5,Loved it thats why i bought it,The movie set in savannah Ga. was just like small town GA. realistic to me. Iwas an extra in this movie.
4,Quite a film,"I am not a big fan of either Robert Altman or John Grisham, but I was going out with some friends and this was the only movie in town that none of us had seen. I was riveted. The use of the color red is reminiscent of the great movie ""Don't Look Now."" Branagh gives a wonderful performance as a great lawyer who was a so-so husband and becomes a good father through the course of the movie. There isn't a pretentious moment in it. As a southerner by birth, I was the only one of my friends to laugh through the party scene at the beginning. It was dead accurate."
1,Only watch this if you're completely bored,"1. I happened to rent this at the library--> overall, a barely entertaining film with surprising mediocre acting via K. Branagh.2. I'm just doing my service to mankind by warning folks to steer clear of this dud of a film."
2,Don't waste your time,"This was a terrible movie---totally ridiculous, illogical, unbelieveable plotline--I just can't believe it got favorable ratings from the critics. The only reason I gave it one star above the worst rating is because Kenneth Branagh does a great Southern accent."
4,"Not as ambitious as usual for Altman, but succeeds on its own terms.","One could see this as 'Short Cuts' correlativeopposite. That was a movie with great ambitions, that - while good -fell just short. This is a movie of much lesser aim (just a good tensethriller/mystery), that's much more successful on it's own terms.The acting is very good throughout. It may be my favorite KennethBranagh performance; understated and subtle. And a number of the scenesreally are tense. Altman finds some clever ways to create suspense withsound and image that aren't just retreads of what we've seen before.Admittedly, some of the twists are pretty creaky and predictable, thelogic sometimes questionable, and the moral POV of the film is a bitconfusing. But this still blows most modern Hollywood thrillers out of thewater."
3,Great Looking but Not So Thermal,"You get what you pay for is a truism I guess. This carafe looks wonderful (many compliments at Thanksgiving), and feels like an heirloom, but it just doesn't keep anything hot all that long. By the time people were ready for a second cup of coffee, the coffee was just barely acceptably hot. I bought this since the Alfi line is so expensive, and this had similar good looks, but I suppose the Alfi carafes are expensive for a reason."
4,"Lots of words, somewhat less actual help","This is the biggest English-Swahili/Swahili-English dictionary I've seen, but it doesn't offer much beyond the words. I have had some success using it in conjunction with the Pimsleur audio course, which I think is really good, but on it's own I don't believe this item would be much help. I'd love to see some usage notes or idiomatic translations.If all you need are the words themselves, this is the dictionary for you. On the other hand, if you want to learn to use the words conversationally, this is at best one tool you'll want in your toolkit."
4,"Where monkeys had the right to vote, but not women...","Liberia in the 1940's was a land of rubber trees and prostitutes. Some American soldiers were sent to guard the all important to the war effort rubber trees from the Nazi threat - and met some very interesting local ladies. In fact, the US Army thoughtfully set the ladies up a camp of their own.The book is written by a former Army doc then stationed at the camp with some public health insights as well as observations on the local custom of female circumcision. His All-American narrative voice is delightful but at times repeats stories told in other parts of the book. I found it highly entertaining, but some may not have my appreciation of sordid humor."
5,Paint Ease,This tape work very well I have other tape and had problems with it staying in place and bleeding This tape I will buy again . I have no bleed or lack of sticking
2,Disappointed,I am really disappointed with the sun helmet I ordered. The sun helmet I received was completely different from my previous sun helmet. The shape and size of the brim and the light weight of this helmet allows the wind blows it up and off my head. I have the velcro strap over as far as it will go and the hat is still not secure enough on my head to keep it from blowing up. I am trying to figure out a way to fix it so that it will be usable. Any suggestions are welcome. Doris Ainsworth
1,TERRIBLY MADE,"I have no idea why I saw this movie in the first place, perhaps it was because The Jungle Book is a fascinating story. However I was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly(in a stupid way).The action scenes were terrible. I recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies."
2,Predictable and dull,"This book had me scratching my head, wondering how it got published. There was nothing to sustain it for the first two hundred pages apart from two events, Eliza leaves her lover and her sister Martha gets dumped by her husband. So I waded through that bit hoping for something a bit more interesting than descriptions of Martha cleaning up after the kids and drinking her woes away and Eliza going on dull dates with dull men.But the only thing that happened after that was that Martha met a two dimensional prat called Jack who had a big penis and that apparently was the cure all for being heartbroken. After that I stopped reading, because frankly I was bored. Sorry Adele, your characters are about as believable as those in a day time soap."
3,Vaguely interesting but unrealistic,"I enjoyed reading this book, but it was just so predictable. I kept thinking that the author was going to stick in some sort of plot twist, but it never happened. I liked reading about the two sisters and I liked the descriptions of their neighborhoods in London. But, jeez, to get dumped by your husband and then fall immediately into a absolutely perfect relationship with the very first guy you meet. It was just too perfect."
3,Fear,"On the whole I rate this a pretty good album and if you pass through the shops and see it,it is certainly worth a buy.However,as I will be discussing-there are let down points in the album. One can summarise it as being an album with a mixture of having some of the best all time Maiden songs on it but at the same time there are songs that are a real let down.Clearly the best song on the album is the title track ,closely followed by Afraid to shoot strangers.There are other pretty good songs such as the fast beat ""Be Quick or be dead"",the impressive ""From here to eternity"",and another admirable song ""Childhoods End"". Then there are the songs that dont come in the top catergory but are still worth a listen such as ""The Fugitive"",""Chains of misery"" and ""Judas be my guide"". However,the other songs are generally crap to listen to if your a proper maiden fan.""Wasting Love"" isnt too bad but I dislike ""Fear is the key"",""The Apparition"" and ""Weekend Warrior""."
2,Uninspiring,"The most powerful pipes in metal take a coffee break on this album. Its hard to believe, in the midst of ""From Here To Eternity"" this is the same guy singing who brought us ""Run To The Hills"". Another neo-prog Steve Harris dominated affair, the production is flat, with distant Bruce and poor Nicko suffering the most. There are some pretty decent tracks on here - ""Be Quick Or Be Dead"" and Bruce perks up a little on the silly ""Weekend Warrior"". There's also a lot more interesting prog-like song structure with ""Afraid to Shoot Strangers"" and ""Fear of the Dark"". Such musical adventure would be much appreciated on an album with good songs. At least _No_Prayer_For_The_Dying_, insipid as it was, still had a really loose sense of fun about it. This is the insufferably dreary, misanthropic second-cousin to _7th_Son_of_a_7th_Son, although I can't help but think it would have been helped by Steve Harris not hanging around behind the console. 2-1/2 stars"
3,It's neither half full nor half empty.,"Some great songs, some weak songs...how to decide? 5 stars? Nope. 1 star? No way! Any reasonable rock fan would realise that this album is a mixed bag and judge it accordingly. I personally happen to enjoy listening to this album in it's entirety, even if I know that not all the songs are great though. Is it worth buying? I think it is."
3,"Not as good as the 80's, but better than the ""Wasted Years"" with Blaze...","To all the reviewers trashing this album: give me a break! I'll take this Maiden album with Bruce singing over any of the music from that same early 90's era. After the atrocities committed by Maiden with Blaze Bayley singing lead, ""No Prayer for the Dying"" and ""Fear of the Dark"" became 5-star classics in comparison. For the record, ""X Factor"" is the worst Maiden album to date. Even having Bruce sing ""Lord of the Flies"" or ""The Sign of the Cross"" live doesn't make them more appealing, much less tolerable. Any album that produces a concert favorite such as ""Fear of the Dark"" cannot be that bad. Still though, ""The Number of the Beast"" through ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"" remain Maiden's best offerings. Up the irons!"
3,Not as good as the live version because.............,"This band lost it's lead singer and then got him back. The lead singer on this CD is not the main man, who is the best front man I have ever seen. The band itself is very talented on all levels musician-wise. Catch this band live on Palladia TV. They charge too much for tickets for their show($425). This band is not one of those ""Satanic-based"" heavy metal bands. They have fun. Some of the best musicians on this planet are in this band including two of the three guitar players, the bass player(who is the leader) and the drummer. Add in the front man and this is a superb band.............just not on this CD."
4,A Good Albumn,I enjoyed this albumn; but I don't think it is as good as their previous albumns. 'Fear Of The Dark' is one of my favorite songs. This is definetly one to add to your Iron Maiden collection. Up The Irons!
4,Maiden Shows Some Signs Of Life: But Maybe Too Late,"After the heinous trash that was No Prayer For The Dying, Iron Maiden managed to put out a decent album before saying a fond farewell to frontman Bruce Dickinson. With such cool songs as Afraid To Shoot Strangers, Fear Of The Dark & Be Quick Or Be Dead, Maiden was showing some signs of resurgence. There is the usual amount of filler that has become the staple of Maiden albums for the past decade but it's reasonable instead of mildly retarded. Here To Eternity is okay. Weekend Warrior, Fear Is The Key & Judas Be My Guide are auto-pilot Iron Maiden. This is truly the end of an era. Dickinson will eventually return, but the year 2000 will have come and gone.Dig it!"
4,Iron Maiden Fear of the Dark,"Quite the variety on this one, from very Iron Maiden to hard rock. A ballad or two. For Iron Maiden this is an out of the ordinary sounding album. Bruce's voice on here is fine. A bit raspy, but I think it's to go with the music style for these particular songs. Bass is very weak. Very unique album and have grown quite fond of after listening to for a while. I feel it's worth picking up. There are some songs that might take some getting used to."
3,A Mediocre Album,"""Fear of the Dark"" disappointed many Maiden fan'showever, they still managed to pull the hit ""Be Quick or Be Dead"" out of the rut. But the failure of one album would not keep Maiden from producing more hits as they would later prove to the world. Also Recommended: Piece of Mind"
3,Solid Maiden album,I like it especially Judas be my guide and fear of the dark which are two of the best tracks i have heard from the band
2,The beginning of the end,"""No Prayer For the Dying"" was the last quality Maiden album. Even though they sounded old and tired every song was decent. ""Fear"" is a total hit and miss affair. A first for Maiden. A crack in the armour that has only gotten worse since the unspeakable horror that is Blaze or whatever that singer's name is. Don't even get me started on Gers. The biggest long haired [person] that ever strapped on a guitar. Not only are his guitar solos utterly horrific he is the worst heavy metal performer in history bar none. Prancing around the stage like a long haired ballerina in tennis shoes. I saw them on this tour and the arena was half full. In the 80's the same arena was so packed you couldn't movean inch. Alas, a sign of the times. Nirvana and Co. single handedly destroyed our beloved 80's metal. Bruce saw the writing on the wall and bailed out just in time. BTW, his solo albums arelight years ahead of the [stuff] Maiden put out after this one."
4,Very good replacement heads,"These do the job my norelco hasn't for years-they actually give me a close shave. Considering my original heads lasted 16 years (no kidding, they really did) and always did a passible job, I never saw the need for replacement-until I replaced them. It does make quite a difference."
5,the old man's replacement find,"Since I'm an old guy, this replacement head is a find. The older I get, the less I want to replace any of my old stuff with the new electronic stuff. So, finding a head that just goes on my current razor is a great thing. Then, it works great. Like my razor makes me look smooth and clean cut again. I have a heavy beard, and my wife looked for the correct head a long time, but having it work so well, is really good news for her. Thanks again.Chazman"
3,Life,"A drama, not a comedy. Sure there are a few laughs, but considering the amount of trajedy, death, and cruel treatment, this is far from a comedy. I don't consider ""Cool Hand Luke"" a comedy either, do you? This is however. a pretty decent story and if you can stand almost non-stop foul language (some people are under the false impression this makes them sound tough) it is worth a rental for adults only. The subject matter and language makes me recommend this to adults only. The story centers around two young men that have a bad string of luck by being found at a murder victims body by the sheriff that killed him. Add to that they are transporting moonshine and off they go to prison for life. Their life time there is spent with some interesting other prisoners, many as much victims of what most blacks suffered up until around the 1970s when their rights finally started to be recognised. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Harlem Nights"".CA Luster"
1,Crap transfer on Blu Ray,"The disc is cheap for a reason. The transfer is crap. Filtered to death waxy images with some sharpening added for good measure. Bad video camera look, not film look."
3,"Entertaining, but forgettable","I found parts of it to be hilarious and stayed with the story throughout it's feature so it wasn't that bad. It could have been better considering that it starred Eddie Murphy AND Martin Lawrence. Although I must say this...it was a heck of alot better than ""Holy Man"" and ""Blue Streak""."
2,Not for everyone,"Fans of R.A. Lafferty will likely appreciate this one, but I lost interest and patience not far into the book. Probably a better book than I give it credit for, but I just can't do semi-silly any more."
1,Retardando,"Summary of the first 80 pages: Manfred Macx, the protagonist, is a sort of uber-websurfer. He loses his glasses, but his girlfriend finds them.At this point, there were three hundred and thirty-five pages left, but I wasn't sure I could handle this much excitement. Good luck to those who buy this book; be aware it is available as a free and legal download."
2,Where is the plot?,"This book has received great acclaims for the many ideas and concepts presented in it — if you trust the raves on the cover. As I see it there are mainly two ideas: 1) convert all available matter to ""computronium"" and 2) upload yourself, your pets and your companies. What you get is basically an intersolar internet with ""ghosts in the machine"".Now try to add a plot to this... Well here is where it fails. The plot is basically non-existing and reading about the same ""great ideas"" over and over again gets boring after a while.This book was a disappointment after having read ""Singularity Sky "" and ""Iron Sunrise"" by the same author. Exciting books with both ideas and a plot."
2,A Raw Beginning,"As almost everyone notes, the first Fanclub album suffers from poor sound and underdeveloped material. Although there are signposts here and there pointing the way to the future, they are bogged down by the lesser tracks and horrid production.For hardcore Fanclub fans only, others proceed with caution."
2,A Hint Of Better Things To Come,"This is Teenage Fanclub's first album, and it suffers from muddy production, half-realized melodies, and somewhat ragged musicianship. Still, it is mildly interesting in its own unpolished way, and it hints at greater things to come."
5,Such a Good Looking Film,"I don't have much to add to the intelligent reviews already presented here. But I wanted to mention I was stunned by the cinematography of ""High Noon."" I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It might be, visually, my favorite black and white film. These images are straight-forward, but very haunting, maybe like Seven Samurai in that way. You could take a screen shot of almost any frame in High Noon and it would make an evocative photograph.Does anyone know why they shot it at such a square ratio in 1952? I was bummed out about that at first - I guess we all want our tv screens filled up - but that lasted about two minutes and then I was hooked. Seems like the shape is perfect for framing this story."
5,"A tense, humanist drama of principles, courage and regret","""High Noon"" surprised me with its quality. I was expecting a good Western, but I was not expecting a multi-layered, metaphorical and psychological drama. This is genre storytelling at its finest, using the setting of a Western to tell a more far-reaching story.Short, ringing in at only 84 minutes, ""High Noon"" manages to capture a complete tale in glances, unspoken dialog, gestures and implied content. Filmed in real time, there is a tense urgency as well as a melancholy finality. The clock ticks towards high noon, and nothing will stop it.Gary Cooper is excellent as a retiring hero, past his prime but still willing to stand up for his principles. He is a living example of the saying ""better to light a single candle than to curse the darkness."" He risks everything to light his candle. Grace Kelley is just beautiful. Katy Jurado is a smoldering woman.Really, just one of the best films of all time."
1,toshiba battery,"Wife recently installed the battery in her laptop and charged for 24 hours. Upon disconnecting and running on battery, found that battery lasted less than 20 minutes. Will check with toshiba to find out if they know why. Otherwise will contact amazon for return instructions as I cannot locate my invoice. Also, battery arrived well packed and as advertised by amazon, but without instructions of any kind for its use or how to obtain auxiliary equipment for charging, etc,. I therfore have to give the shopping experience a 4 but an overall rating of 1 for the disappointment in operation."
3,Revolutions was nothing Revolutionary,"Short and sweet. The philosophy was nill, the story line did not progress, the dialogue was predicatble as was the story itself.The special effects were lovely, though the battles themselves were without passion, vigor, fear, or anything other than high tech combat.Trinity stole this movie, her scenes were the only ones of depth and true character. This film was no fault of the actors, it simply was not written to do anything other than end."
3,The Middle Road,"I think the old sports adage is ""somewhere in-between"". Thats the category ""Matrix - Revolutions"" falls into. Is it a 5 star movie? No. (But the first was.) Is it a 1 star movie? No. It's somewhere in-between.I think I can say I was honestly disappointed in this movie, based on its predecesors success. Too much CGI, too much philosophy, too much. Less is more; the Wachowski brothers and George Lucas would do well to realize that great technology does not equate to great film making.In any case, I'm waiting to purchase the Matrix Trilogy in a pre-packaged collector's edition."
4,Great!!!!!,"This movie was a perfect ending to a Trilogy. Even though most sequels do better than the original, this one was just right. It answered all the questions you were wondering from the first two, and even though the ending is not what I expected it was perfect. Others viewers who watched this and said it sucked, they were expecting other things than what the movie was actually suppose to tell. It told a great story and ended with all answers to questions some people might have had. I gave it 4 stars because it could have kept going and finished a little more better, but all in all good ending to a great trilogy."
1,The worst movie ever.,"This movie has to be the worst film I have ever seen!!!! There's no plot at all and in one sceane, Neo gets stuck in a white box!No one can act ethier, infact, you know what the charictors are going to say before they even say anything! How the war in between man and the robots ended is the sadest thing ever!Never see this film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,the greatest movie ever,i love this movie so much. this is the greatest movie of 2003 and the best of the matrix trilogy. the story goes like this ( warning spoilers ahead)neo lives in the matrix but he wants to lead humanity to a better place so he has to battle these machines that look like people. the fight scenes were so exciting that i was on the edge of my seat. the special effects are absolutly breathtaking. the wachowski brothers are officialy geniouses. I cant wait for part 4. make sure to buy matrix pt2 ( its out on dvd right now!) and watch it first so that you can follow the story because it is very deep then Do yourself a favor and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
1,This was the conclusion?,"I have no idea what the Wachowski brothers were thinking when they imagined the resolution of the Matrix trilogy, but this is a joke. I was hoping for something on the order of Testuo in Akira, or Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. But this?Visually, the moive is absolutely amazing. The battle for Zion is spectacular and the final Smith vs. Neo fight was amazing. But the first Matrix movie didn't make millions because of fight sequences, but because of the thought-provoking theory of the Matrix.The purpose of these two films was to introduce and resolve the real story of the Matrix. I enjoyed the story from Enter the Matrix (the video game) better than this. That story kept me begging for more. This story leaves me begging for more too: two more writers to write a sensible screenplay."
2,????,"I waited patiently and excitedly for this movie to be released last year, but boy i was i mad when i left the movies. i thought the point of this movie was to tie up the loose ends, but all it did was leave more loose ends. they talked and talked but never said a thing. just a bunch of gibberish. i havent seen it on dvd yet but i at least hope it has some extra stuff to fill in the blanks.p.s. at least the some of the action wasnt too bad."
3,Tops of heads cut off-,"I don't know if it's just these DVD's (2nd & 3rd sequels)or if it is the intent of the director but, in 90% of the scenes with headshots, the tops of the heads are cut off. Haven't watched our old Matrix DVD to see if it's the same way yet. It's weird and I don't like it but, since we'll only watch them once a year at most and they were cheap.....I don't care I guess."
1,Could anyone please explain me what happened?,"This movie feels forced, almost like if they had simply shot it to complete the trilogy, the death of the main characters and the ending simply left me aghast because of their absurdity. And all that quasi-philoshophical babble ends being laughable: ""Cogito ergo sum vis a vis, capicci?"". Why the trouble of watching three movies if at the end everything is cycled and planned beforehand by the machines? I can only marvel at how far this movie is from that ""Matrix"" that amazed audiences and movie critics alike and went to win 4 Oscar movie awards. Almost always the third installment is the worst in a series: Superman 3, Jaws 3, Alien 3. Don't waste your money and better go and read a good Sci-Fi novel. Carlos M. Santillan H."
2,Disappointing,"You know the Matrix was great.Reloaded was disappointingRevolutions is something you see for one reason, you saw the first two so you might as well see the lastThe CLIMAX of the whole trilogy is Neo facing a digital entity alla The Wizard of OzThe FACE encounter at the end is probably the biggest let down there isWhile the encounter of THE PROGRAMMER was interesting in ReloadedNeo and THE FACE was to say it bluntly, LOUSYI say we should all throw away our copies of Reloaded and Revolutions and act like THE MATRIX as a one shot dealThe other two films are NOT WORTHY"
3,Doesn't compare to the first but still ok,"This movie follows the final stages of the battle between humans and machines and the choices Neo must face. In the beginning, Neo is in a place between the matrix and reality called the train station. I won't tell you anymore because it would spoil the movie. I thought the fight between Neo and Agent Smith was well done but the ending seemed underdone. But it was still a movie I would reccomend to see in theaters. Overall, it's not as good as the first two (the first one being the best) but it is still a movie that sticks to the story and sort of completes the matrix regime."
3,Why did he go back to hand-to-hand combat?,"At the end of the first movie, Neo figured out that it was all a program that he could manipulate at will. Then he went back to hand-to-hand combat in the 2nd and 3rd movies. That is just absurd. And instead of flying around, he could have simply popped in at a different location like the agents do.The other thing I didn't like was the move away from the sharp camera angles. The first movie felt like a comic book with really high angles showing the rain fall, etc. The 2nd and 3rd degenerated into a flat faux goth feel. The messianic theme seemed to disappear as well."
1,Worse than the second movie,"This film is like watching the Super Bowl and havng it end in a tie. That's exactly what happens at the end--the entire war between the machines and the people ends in a draw.Imagine if Jaws ended that way. Roy and the shark getting cozy on a couch and saying, ""No hard feelings bud!""Pathetic!"
4,the final chapter,This film met my expectations.It didn't play major mind gamesif it is viewed from the heart.The scenes with Trinity and Neo where nice. Overall the story unfolds faster than Reloaded.Yet the action wasn't as exciting as the freeway scene in the last part.Thank you directors for the greatest story ever told.
5,matrix revolutions just rulez!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS MAY GO DOWN AS THE BEST TRILOGY SET EVER MADE IN THE FACE OF THE EARTH. THIS MOVIE WAS 10 TIMES BETTER THAN MATRIX ANDMATRIX 2, IT HAD SO MUCH ACTION IT WUZ NOT EVEN FUNNY. THE WAR SCENE WAS UNBELIVABLE, JUST CAUGHT MY EYES IN SUSPENSE, THE TALKING IS PERFECT, NOT TO MUCH, NOT TO LITTLE. EVERYTHING WSS PERFECT, THE FIGHT SCENE WITH NEO AND SMITH, CRZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!, I LOVED IT ALL, AND I HAVE THE FIRST 2, I CANT WAIT FOR THIS ONE , JUST AN AMAZING MOVIE, 5 STARS"
3,IT'S [bad],"where did neo go? reloaded was better than this [part], i mean come on, neo did no cool fighting, he pretty much got [down], and handed to him. CGI is great, but i don't wanna see the whole movie in cgi. the first one is still the best, reloaded followings and revolutios dosn't even qualifiy"
1,Worst movie of the Year?,This was such a boring movie. Can't they come up with something new. Matrix 4 is going to be another dumb movie. i think they are going to make enough Matrix's that people are going to get sick of it. I am sick of it already. They should of stopped at one. Nothing the first matrix.
3,Spelling,This has nothing to do with the Matrix. You people need to learn how to spell. I read review after review after review and I have not found one that doesn't have a misspelled word. It's a damn shame you people can't spell simple words. Some of you can't even spell Neo. I won't go into what other words I have seen spelled wrong. Seems most of you went to school for twelve years but only graduated the fouth grade. And these are all people from the US...what a waste.
4,"It IS the matrix, but the first one is still the best","This movie has the same basic directing and acting skills as the rest of the movies, and all the INSANE coriography with those fight scenes. But the first one was still the best one over-all. You just can't beat the lobby shootout...although the sick fight in that park with Neo and all the cloned Smiths was HILARIOUS when he pulls out the bo (well, it was a streetpost, but eh, it still works) and messes them all up. The main thing is that this finally provides the answers to the entire trilogy, even though you'll have to watch all three of them in sequential order three times in order to catch it all. Definatly a buy for Matrix fans."
4,Matriculated,"The Ending (?) to one of the highest selling trilogies in movie history. I was so happy when this movie came on the big screen, as ALL my predictions about what would happen in the final instalment of the Matrix series came true. It's everything you have come to expect from the Matrix movies and a hell of a lot more! Don't be surprised if it sweeps the SFX categories at all upcoming award ceremonies. Matrix fans have no fear, something this good will definitely have another movie made about it. ( A prequel too perhaps? ).In this Saga, Neo and Trinity goes to the machine world to strike a deal to end all deals - peace. The war in zion is one of the best war sci-fi scenes I've ever seen in all my years.It's interesting to note that some Matrix fans still have not seen the ANIMATRIX - as this is a missing jigsaw that fits in with RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS. What are you waiting for? - JACK IN!"
1,sigh...,"The first was incredible; the second (Reloaded) wasn't too bad for a sequel; the third was boring.Trying not to be biased, but it did have a lot to live up too. Unfortunately, this one just dragged on. I had to force myself to watch it to the end, which is sad.The third is less confusing than the previous two, but also less exciting. For an intelligent series, this one doesn't fit.Oh well, I'm sure the Wachowski bros. have some great things up their sleeves for future projects."
4,Gotterdammerung,"Along with George Lucas with the STAR WARS series, The Wachowski Brothers have gone to the well that was expounded by Joseph Campbell with epochal ""The Hero of Thousand Faces"" to create another myth for our time. What became in THE MATRIX is story of the naif (John Anderson a/k/a Neo) who called to his path by a mysterious shaman (Morpheus. In THE MATRIX RELOADED, that naif is still awakening and fighting every minion of (...)on his great path. In REVOLUTIONS, the naif has finally awakened to realized that he and his path must end.In short, REVOLUTIONS concludes all of this with all of the vigor that Wagner put into ending his Ring Cycle. The Machine assault on Zion is an assault on the senses that can be best described and viewed as Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH if it was directed by Jackson Pollock.For me, the trilogy will provide food for thought for audiences, critics and students of cinema for years to come."
2,"Sorry, but just a let down","I finally got around to seeing this on dvd. I saw the original at the movies twice and on tape and dvd many times over. The second movie was so bad I didn't even go to the theater to see this one. A shame.I don't know what happened, but perhaps the incredible success of the first left nowhere to go but down.This movie was a cliche with horrible dialogue and a hard to follow plot. Nothing about the special effects make it worth seeing for just for the sake of seeing them.In any case, I guess, if you are like me, and loved the first movie, and saw the second, you're going to want to see this one. However, I don't recommend buying it, why should we reward such disregard for the high standard set by the first Matrix film, surely the LTR series didn't do this kind of thing (although the Star Wars series sure did)."
4,Good one!,"While it's not the first one(trust me nothing can compare with the first)it's better than the 2nd, which left me in the dust with it's religous philosophy and dragged action. this is one where I truly felt like I had felt with the matrix again. There is no explanation except that it swamped me with it's matrixness. It totally rolled me over in it. It's not the first, but it comes close."
4,visual effects are passing,I give it 4 stars for the visual effects only. You need to buy all 3 disks of the set to enjoy the story plot.
2,What a letdown,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Matrix and the whole idea behind it. 1 and 2 were great movies, full of action and awesome special effects. Revolutions however was a horrible way to end such a legendary story. It was cluttered with scenery instead of cool special effects and fight scenes, and if felt very dragging. I was expecting to see Neo finish the whole thing and he didn't do anything monumental (I won't ruin the end for those who haven't seen it) I also got this feeling of a religious metaphor with the savior and sacrifice and peace and all....not my style, thanks. I actually booed at the end. Better than most movies, yes, but come on, this is the MATRIX! It was a disgrace. I won't buy the DVD."
1,Awful,"This movie was horrible compared to the first Matrix. Somewhere along the line this ""trilogy"" went from thoughtful science fiction to mindless action and special effects. Avoid."
1,The worst ending possible!,"I was really looking forward to the movie. It turned into nothing, but trash. It didn't answer any of the questions raised in the previous movies. The main characters are non-existant. Neo is powerless. So, unlike the first two movies.The Matrix could've been a Truly Great Series. But, the ending falls flat on it's face. To me, it was very depressing."
2,matrix revolting crap,"I will make it short and sweet, this movie absolutely sucked.I mean compared to the 1st movie which was awesome,and reloaded was fair,but this had no point ,no story and the ending,what the hell was that?"
3,Bittersweet...,"I agree with the writer of the review a few posts down, Revolutions has a very bittersweet ending, it makes me sad because it could have ended another way without losing Neo and Trinity, most of the scenes take place in the real world and Zion, wich is also a slight letdown, not as much "" in matrix action"" mostly real-world horrific warzone, it get's really bloody and takes a little out of a horror movie, I found myself thinking ""am I watching the matrix? or machine jurassic park?""But the beginning was interesting, the oracles body guard does some helpful action, and Smith loses his mind altogether...It didn't really feel like a Matrix film to me, but I guess everyone will see it differently. I got the point after the ending, but they didn't have to go about it the way they did."
3,What Happened?,"I was so disappointed. What happened to the trilogy? The ending left most people hanging...The matrix was a build to basically nothing, that really sucks.The matrix revolution movie was better than reloaded in that it actually had a storyline and there were the deep moments. When the general was fighting and when Trinity died. It was so sad....sorry for those who haven't seen it, the end fight scene with agent smith was good but appeared very fake at times.And there were way to many machines...It was a technological breakthrough but dang, enough is enough. Overall the Matrix Revolutions was better than Reloaded but a disappointment."
2,Plot threads left hanging,"If I recall from the original ""Matrix"" Morpheaus tells Neo that the ""One"" would bring the end of the war and the destruction of the Matrix. However, by the end of ""Revolution$"" the Matrix is still in existence. Was Morpheaus wrong? Was Neo really the one? Upon watching the original ""Matrix"" again many glaring inconsistencies emerge. While the ending of ""Revolutions"" was interesting it was too loaded with philosophical claptrap. Ultimately, the Matrix became the fish that eat its own tail. The guaranteed audience for this dribble made these movies critic proof. People flocked to see the film, as did I, only to realize that it was no more than a subtle money grab by the studio to exploit the desire of film goers to recapture the magic of the original."
1,From WHAT IS THE MATRIX to WTF???,"I just dont understand. The brothers had this franchise that they could have been a huge contender for best sci fi movie series of all. But for some reason, they got greedy and went way out of there minds with special FX. Granted, they are great FX, but that is NOT why I and millions of others loved the first matrix, the FX was a bonus. The first matrix REALLY made you think. It made you question life, and was totally origanl from anything that was on film at the time. For some reason, it went from this vaste world of wonder to : the movie is ganna end in 48 hours, and turns into a war movie. Its a shame that the first matrix is ruined by these high special FX, low story telling sequals. The only good part of this film is the Special FX and fights, other than that, if you wanna a mind blowing trip into wonderland, watch the origanl."
2,No Closure Here,"First of all I am a great fan of the first two Matrix movies. This movie gave me no closure at all. It seemed more toward the end that not even the directors knew how to end such a massive movie so they ended the movie the quickest way they knew how. The storyline has no movement whatsoever and the actress that replaced the old oracle is not very good. Not only that but the movie seemed to try and focus in on her changing in some stupid way. I really didn't like this movie and I know that any fan will go to the theater and see it despite what I say, but I really do just recommend that you continue to watch the first and second Matrix. Leave the end to imagination and don't watch this third movie. The only good thing I can say about the movie is that the battles between Zion and the machines is awesome."
4,"Good movie, but my least favorite out of all.","Still worth watching, but I thought it was so-so. The nice part is that it wrapped up the series in a logical way."
3,To CGI for me,"I'm not a huge fan of the matrix, it's too cunfusing, and to much computerized. 2/3's of the movie was computer.The last fightes are, like the battle of zion, the last neo and smith fight, mostly CGI.The only one that was the best was the 1st Matrix, that had alot of more guns and more possable wall running scenes. In this one people run on ceilings. thats pretty stupid to me, and theres alot of goths that are really freaky lookin at frist, then you watch this movie a 2nd time and there not so freaky lookin. The plot is very confusing but also very creative, worth 2 stars. see this if you want to find out what happens, not if you just like kung fu movies."
5,A shining star.,"Stevie Nicks, the golden-haired gypsy of Fleetwood Mac, spread her wings and became a beautiful butterfly in this recording. Her haunting ""Rhiannon"" was a hint of her songwriting skills, but few thought she could rock the way she did on ""Bella Donna"". Her distinctive voice is all gravely-feminine heart and soul. She is the lady of rock and roll."
4,Her best solo effort,"Stevie Nicks as we all know came to fame with Fleetwood Mac.Her songs with Fleetwood Mac were dark, like Rhiannon, Gypsy etc.In her first solo effort she sheds the image somewhat and shows us her Rock side.She engages Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Don Henley and others to come up with a classic solo album.I can listen to this as easily as any Fleetwood Mac album with her and Lindsay Buckingham.She also goes country with Leather and Lace. She also does ""Stop draggin my heart around"" which could arguably be the best song of her career.This shows she does not need Lindsay Buckingham ( or Fleetwood Mac for that matter). She is also one of the great writers of Rock history.If you like Stevie Nicks, this is where I would start. This will always be her classic solo album.She is one of the great Rock icons of all time..........enjoy"
4,Bella Donna,"With the success of ""Fleetwood Mac"" Stevie decided to venture on her own for a solo album that eventually became her best selling album so far. While ""Bella Donna"" is probably her best album, it also is her only # 1 album. The duets on the album (With Tom Petty and Don Henley) are great songs. Bella Donna the albums title track is also effective. However the standout has got to be Edge of Seventeen"" (one of her best songs) The albums other notable songs include ""The Highwaymen"", ""Think About It"" and the single ""After The Glitter Fades"". A powerful debut from the enchanting Stevie Nicks. Best song on the album: Edge of Seventeen"
5,A wonderful album to Stevie Nicks fans new or old!!!!,"Stevie Nicks is an amazing lady. And this album shows it!!!!! I listen to this CD straight threw. I love everything about it and if you like Stevie Nicks, you'll LOVE this CD. I think it is her best work."
5,Ten Foot Pole is classic,"First of all, I wasn't sure which TFP CD to write a review for because I like them all equally and they're all great. I just chose this one because it's the most recent one I bought. I saw these guys a few days ago at the Metro in Chicago on the amazing ""Punk-o-Rama"" tour. They completely blew the house down. I liked them as much as Millencolin, and they're my favorite band. I strongly suggest you buy this because the music is great and the guys in the band are cool. They also sold this own merchandise at the show for a cheap price which I thought was really cool. And if the punk-o-rama tour comes to your town, I suggest you see it!"
4,Good but not the best,"This new 10 Foot Pole album is with no doubt a good melodic punk album, they didn't loose their power when they're playing. In my my opinion UNleashed is a better album, but they managed to keep their punk quality."
3,throw away watch- looks more expensive than it is from a distance,a little bulky but could be mistaken for another titanium watch brand from a distance. it works. can't complain for the price.
3,Not such good science,"Cataclysm!: There is definitely Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C. however, the authors do themselves a disservice by pushing an agenda that has no solid science behind it. Ice-age theory is supported by data from many diverse sources. Also, the cosmic catastrophe had multiple, civilisation affecting, events during the last 13000 years."
4,"good design, but handle could be more comfortable","I bought this food mill because it's the same design as the food mill my grandmother has had for decades. I've been using it the past few weeks to make tomato gazpacho. This food mill is more than up to the task.The stainless steel surface is easy to keep clean, and it disassembles for even easier cleaning. As a nice touch, the diameter of the scraper wire on the bottom of the mill is just a fraction smaller than the grill holes, which means that if you have seeds lodged in any of the holes after cleaning, you can use the scraper wire to knock them out.The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the double-loop handle can be uncomfortable to hold after a while. (I can understand why they used the double-loop design--because it stays cooler if you're milling over a heated pot--but I think I would've preferred having a more comfortable handle and using a potholder if necessary.)"
1,Poor quality - NO warranty,"I don't usually do reviews, but this needs to be said. This product didn't last through more than a dozen times of use... It never worked right from the beginning, but I didn't know it then. Finally the bottom broke apart. When I called Wearever they said there is NO warranty at all. Guess this will go in the trash and I will have to purchase a better food mill with a lifetime warranty! Does not compare to the old original Foley's of my grandmother and mothers time!!"
5,"Mirro 50025 Foley 3.5-Quart Stainless Steel Food Mill Cookware, Silver","Hey, it's a Foley. My grandmother and mother used these for making so much great appleasuce and now I shall as well."
4,Foley Food Mill,My mom used to use one of these when I was a kid to can tomato juice. I've been borrowing it for years but finally broke down and bought my own. It is an excellent food mill for tomato juice. It is very simple to operate and clean.I looked at several other food mills but opted for the Foley because of its sturdy contruction.
1,Useless,"I am very sorry I ordered this item in mid-July anticipating my fall needs, as now that I have had a chance to see how useless it is, the return window has closed. I am still considering returning it for the 50% return, meaning I am willing to pay half the price of this food mill to be rid of it. You would do better trying to process fruit/veg with a couple of spoons."
3,Misses a main point,"Seems to me that the centrally important music in this movie was not written by John Williams: it was Schubert's ""Unfinished"" Symphony, the first movement of which was played (in part) twice by my count. No accident that it was the ""Unfinished."" That was the movie's essence: unfinished crimes. Only if Schubert--or any other composer--had written an ""Uncommitted"" symphony could it have been more appropriate."
4,Minority Report,"While not as memorable as some of John William's most famous work (JAWS, STAR WARS etc), this is still a solid addition to the Spielberg/Williams cannon, with etheral notes and fast-paced percussion. Similar from A.I in style, the score changes from quiet to fast, pulse-driven type, with some great tracks including ""Can You See?"" and ""Everybody Runs!"". This is however, a rare Williams score which, while interesting in parts, is not as well-played as previous efforts, and perhaps works better as an accompnant to the film rather than a stand alone soundtrack. Still, it's a solid score that enthralls and excites with new methods hirthero unheard in the maestro's other music."
4,don't bring this album to the slaughter....,"This album is a very solid record.Its just....a continuing change in their career.If anyone listens to all of the albums straight in order (excluding live albums and greatest hits) you finish up Powerslave (one of their heaviest albums) and you hit Somehwere In Time...you sit there and look at your cd player and say ""what the heck?? this sucks!"" But if you listen to it any other time you realize how awesome and incredible it is.This album, like a lot of Maiden albums, just flows very differently from ones that came before, and after.Its a very wonderful album, just give it a chance.Oh...and...on the enhanced version of the album, the cover art is changed, yes, but I think the actual disc's art is the original album cover. (with the fat man with the lantern being strangled)"
4,Not a bad album,"This album is absolutly not a bad album, but don't expect another 7th son. Maiden's first album of the 90's and the first album with Janick Gers, the idea was to create a more ""live"" sound on this album. Well the ""live"" sound definatly came out well, but at the end of the album I sort of had the idea ""I missing something"", I don't know what it is but it's missing. If you're a Maiden fan, buy it. If you're a general heavy metal fan, and you have the money to spend, buy it. But if you wanna buy that great album with your last money, I would advise buy ""Brave New World"" instead."
3,No Prayer for this one,"This album is a good example of Maiden's decline without Adrian Smith's creative input and how much Janick Gers sucks. This marks the era of recycled Maiden songs and the point where a song entitled ""The _________ "" gets really old. ""Tailgunner"" should be called ""Aces High from the back seat"". ""Holy Smokes"" is a really funny video, but belongs as a ""B-side"". Most of the other songs are really worth skipping, particularly the title track which is terrible, and Bruce really has a hard time with singing softer songs (that is one thing Paul Di'Anno did well) and his voice sounds scratchy throughout. ""Bring your daughter..."" is ok, but the most underrated song on the album is ""Mother Russia"" which I think is fantastic although it sounds like ""Seventh Son"" during the bridge."
1,Beginning of the problems...,"I can clearly see what Steve Harris was thinking after the classic Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. Maiden was going towards a very progressive path, and had reached its limit in this field. It was time for a change. And by change, in this case, Harris tought of a back to basics approach: raw and straight to the point.We all know now that Adrian Smith did not agree with that, and was replaced by Janick Gers, a guy that really can play raw. Basically, that's all he can do.But what people did not know is that the ""raw"" sound pursued by Harris would result in the worst set of songs ever recorded by Maiden up to that point. They, without exception, have absolutely no merits. The album included one their worst songs ever, BRING YOUR DAUGHTER TO THE SLAUGHTER. HOLY SMOKE is also poor, MOTHER RUSSI is a ludicrous attempt to write an epic song in the veins of Rime and Alexander.As for the new guitarrist, he can't be blamed for that, because he did not write any of them."
2,average maiden,"i'm a big iron maiden fan, and while i do have all their studio albums,i have to say out of all of them, this has to be their least inspired. i really think they got back into form after their ""brave new world"" album. so if your looking for sweeping epic maiden songs you won't really find them on this album. it is at best just an average rock album."
4,"A good, solid album","No Prayer is a strong album from the masters of metal. While it isn't up there with Iron Maiden classics like Powerslave or Number of the Beast, it still rocks hard. The addition of Janick Gers is a good one; he adds a solid crunch. ""Mother Russia"" and ""Holy Smoke"" are the two best songs on the album. The only weak song is ""The Assassin"" and even that isn't that bad. I really dig the lyrics for ""Holy Smoke."" Maiden recorded this album to show their fans that they hadn't gone wimpy after Seventh Son of a Seventh Son- a good album, but light. No Prayer For the Dying is not the first Maiden album that one should get, but one should certainly get it at some point- it's consistently strong."
1,An all time career low point,"This album is absolutely appalling. By any other act at the time it would have been deemed passable, but by the high standards set by Maiden it is an absolute turkey. There is not one track which comes even close to anything else on any previous Maiden album. I don't know what went wrong here but the entire band sound like imposters!! I was dumbstruck by how bad it was when I first bought it. I have been a Maiden fan for two decades and this CD was the nadir for me. Thankfully things have improved greatly since. Take heed and avoid this CD like you would a case of the black death."
1,Was a Die Hard Fan until this one,"Okay, I'm not sure what happenned here I bought this one though and tried really hard to ""get into"" it. This was the album that made me realize that my love for ""Iron Maiden"" The Band, was not as strong as my Love for ""Iron Maiden"" the music. This album is a huge step down from thier traditional sound. They totally break thier promise which I read years earlier in a tour book of I.E. ""trying to avoid the AC-DC sound"". They went from the intelligent lyrics, and sound of 7th son to this almost sell out sound."
3,We want to vacation with the Sterns and eat our way across America!,"This is a wonderful book because my husband and I love trying local places to eat when we travel. This one provides a little extra because it has recipes also. ""Emmy's Big Buns"" are fabulous. The only down side to this book is that it is somewhat dated as some of these places are no longer open. Still worth getting for the ones that are open and for the recipes."
5,Sleeper hit,"Great move for those who are sick of the shallow plot standard Hollywood fare. Witty, smart, fun. See it now."
5,One Man Play in Outer Space,"One Man Play in Outer Space, is what it is. And the Moon looks great, as do the effects Directing and Production. Looks simple, plays tough. Actors work the story. Story works you. Effects grease the drama and Sci-Fi has a new entree. BD is a pistol. Pic and sound tops."
4,its a good movie.,"I really just wanted to put up the stars and leave it at that.......but ok fine..........its a good movie......if you read the story line and though it might be something you like, I will tell you - correct! it will be something you will like; it will not disappoint. Now if you need to see action action action, I'm assuming you can tell from the storyline that this isnt for you. if you didnt figure that out yet, Let me tell you. This isnt for you.now I'm done......."
5,2001 tried to be this good,"2001 was great but if this movie came out the same year, this is the one you would remember.......... Don't read the other reviews, just watch it......."
4,Just the Right Kind of Creepy,"Most of 2001 a Space Odyssey bored me to tears. That is until the final story. I loved it. Sam Rockwell in Moon tells a similarly eerie tale but with a faster pace. It begins with Sam on a highly automated mining base on the moon. It's so automated, he's the only employee there. He's near the end of his three year contracted hitch when something goes amiss outside. He treks out there in a vehicle to investigate and crashes. Later he wakes in the infirmary, a very HAL-like explains that he'd been critically injured and he needs to rest. But Sam wonders about the wreckage outside. The robot forbids hims to inspect it. Sam slips out, finds the crashed vehicle, and a survivor... himself. From then on it gets wonderfully creepy and a bizarre mystery unfolds."
3,Moon,"The movie moon was an ok take on a sci fi psycho drama. The effects were average, the music was adequate and the acting was good"
3,"Good movie, would have made a much better short film","I am a big Sam Rockwell fan and I enjoyed his acting. My issue with this film is with the editing. It would have been a spellbinding 20 or 30 minute short, instead of a very slow moving 1 hour and 38 minute movie."
4,Voyage,"I'm sorry Sterling Hayden only wrote two books because I think he could have been one of the greats. But as with his acting career, he dropped out early, (although I must say I think he was a much better author than an actor). I read Voyage many years ago and went on to read ""The Wanderer"" his autobiographical work. Voyage is about a sailor and the hardships of the sea in the late 1800s. It also deals with the labor union movements of that era. A victim of McCarthyism which ended his acting career, Sterling Hayden's political agenda, in my opinion, was evident in this book. As a sailor I enjoyed it for its realism of the sea and would compare it to Richard Henry Dana's classic ""Two Years Before the Mast""."
1,Over-Hyped bubblegum for the brain,The book has been way over-hyped. It was readable but nothing like you would expect something that has been labeled cyberpunk to be. It is nothing like brunner or Gibson's work. I think this is little more than a text-based D.C. comic. It has interesting concepts but nothing to write home about.Go read or re-read a William Gibson book instead.
3,"Good product but contrary to company name, it's not from France","Unlike the other reviewer, I had no problems taking either the small or larger lid off this cocktail shaker. It does what it's supposed to do and doesn't leak (so far). I like the large size because it allows me to make more than 2 drinks, which is great for parties. My only gripe about it is that the company name, MIU France, is misleading because it's from China. Minor point, but still it bothers me."
2,What?,"I really expected more from this ""thriller"". I call it a ""thriller"" in quotation marks because it is in that genre. Really, though, the film does not have that effect. Halfway through the film, things get boring and never picks up until the final scenes. Instead of using true true suspense, The Jackal resots to violence that is both bloody and unnecessary. Usually, I feel that the more violence the better, but it should never be used to fill loop holes in a weak and pretentious story. And maybe it's just me, but I did not get some of the plot twists in this movie. Bottom line, The only reason it should be seen is if its a weekend night and there's nothing left at the video stroe. Otherwise, skip it, and you won't miss a thing."
3,Bruce Willis was great!,"As far as action movies go, this is a better one. Bruce Willis did a great job of playing the heartless, no feeling, stonefaced bad guy. Never a smile, always focused. The story was very well written, and I am not an action movie fan. Richard Gere also does a great job with the Irish accent. This is action packed, and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Forget Arnold, Bruce & Richard steal the action hero titles! I only buy the DVD's that I know that I will watch again, and this is one of them. I will watch this for a long time to come. END"
1,DON'T BUY--Same flipper disc exactly as before!,"I purchased and then returned this. It is the EXACT flipper disc--complete with scratches on the dvd side--as before. Also there is no physical digital disc. This also holds for the Jackal/Mercury Rising double disc set except the standard side has special features. If you want a single-sided blu-ray, get Der Schakel, a German import. It has a good english audio option with no subtitles and the quality of the blu-ray is excellent. F"
3,COMPARE,"Compare this with the original 'The Day of the Jackal,"" and I think you'll see the former is a far better film than this one. This one did have exciting moments though and deserves a rental, Gere and Willis are always worth a look. Another bit of gratis advice is always to get the DVD version of a film if possible.I am getting impatient with critics who seem to be ready to shoot from the hip and blast the remake of a ""classic"" (Day of the Jackals qualifies here).Look at them without prejudice. I think this applies to the 1998 Psycho too."
1,Hollywood hardup for a new story so they ruin an old one,This is just a piece of ***Hollywood has shown here that they just have no new ideas/stories so they continue to try and use special effects and a bad scriptwriters to remake what was and still is one of the best movies ever.This is not the first Hollywood remake that is garbage and will not be the last but as long as there are people willing to part with good money to watch movies it won't change.This is a good reason why Blockbuster have lost sales recently - nothing worth watching
2,Barbie Wig,"the best thing about this wig was the two cute barrettes that came with it. The size is too large for children, the bangs are awful and it was so itchy my daughter couldn't wear it on Halloween. No more wigs on-line for us!"
2,Other poems not-so-good,"I loved the poems I read in the advertisement on amazon, but was disappointed in the other poems in the actual book."
1,Disappointing,"This was my favorite battle from the history of World War Two and i couldn't wait to watch this as soon as it was ordered, but as early as it started i began to have doubts of it's quality representation of historical facts. I noticed many flaws in it's use of models to represent the ships involved, also the wrong ship was pictured sometimes. What bothered me the most was the inclusion of a ""dramatic plot-line"" which had nothing to do with the Battle of the River Plate, and instead omited historical facts from the film (for example when the Captain of the Graf Spee commited suicide at the end, which was never covered in this film.)"
3,Another true story.,"The use of real ships instead of remote control models is very realistic, but the U.S. cruiser with big white numbers on the bow is silly impersonation of a German warship."
2,"Yeah, Right.","Mellow, artificial singer - average songwriter. Listen to ""All The Wild Horses"" A work of simple genius. The rest are all immediately forgettable.Dylan..?! Morrison..?! Yeah, right, we should be so lucky. This generation is so desperate for a new Dylan, they try to create one every few years."
5,Excellent album,"I bought this album for the title track, but I have loved it more with each listen. Ray Lamontagne has a beautiful, soulful voice.I also agree that this would be a great makeout album...or just perfect for summer nights."
5,Read It! Twice.,"This book is amazing if you like science fiction, and even if you don't. Bova is imaginative and either has done extensive research or knows exactly what he is talking about. The characters are not one sided and undevloped as in many sci-fi books. Bova mixes a compelling story, great near future sci-fi, and a great and unique wiritng style together for an unparalled science fiction novel different from any I've ever read."
4,The Moon In Conflict,"This novel is mainly about what hate and greed can do to the soul. Greg Masterson leads a painful life full of anger, hate and greed which ultimately leads him to kill himself while trying to destroy all those around him.The story line involving the moon and moonbase is exciting. The possibilites that the moon and all space exploration provide are astounding.This is a very interesting and good book, but be ready for a slow read."
5,Great Condition,I ordered the book for a class and didn't want to pay a lot. It got here in time and is in great condition. You would never know it was a used copy.
4,Depressing but true....,"Joe Sacco has tried to put a very complex issue in to a comic book which is a challenge by its on and he got it.Although the book is far from objective he is giving a clear and """"kind"""" of true view of realty through Palestinians eyes.Except for one comic relief (The joke about the 3 secret agents) there are not much of happy moment in the book which make it some kind depressing and make you thing is this really reality?I think not but then again who am I?Still i would recommend this book for people who are not familiar with the situation and would like to know a bit more about it.I have also bought ""Exit wounds"" by Rutu Modan as a comic book from the other side of the conflict. It is something totally different but still worth a try.See my review on it under the title.Cheers.-S-"
2,Poor research w/ an agenda,Palestine is melodramatic propaganda.It tows the PLO party line and does not provide any solutions.
2,Poor description and poor examples,"The book contains short chapters included short descriptions..The 18F452 register construction , subroutines and the examples are in a skin-deep manner.I should say that I have learnt more knowledge from the 18F452 datasheet than this book..I think it is written very quickly for a short time so it had to be poorly..."
3,"Useful information, poor layout.","If having technical diagrams over the page to the corresponding text annoys you, then be prepared to be annoyed! The book doesn't get going really until chapter 3, however I found that having the technical figures (in most cases) not on the page or adjoining page, but having to flick back and forth a distraction to my concentration. The diagrams while helpful are a little confusing with the way in which they are layed out.In some places after describing a method in addressing registers, the example uses an alternative - fine, if in the context of, there is more than one way to achieve this, but this is patently not the context here.The book seems to be really designed to be part of a classroom tutorial and discussion.Be ready to put in some extra concentration if your buying this book without resource to other literature.On the whole the book is technically useful, the hardcover pleasant, but the placing of the diagrams really let the book down."
2,3-year olds making noise,This is ridiculous music. It literally sounds like a group of 3-year olds banging away on musical instruments.It's a joke.
1,Review of Unabridged Audio,"I am sure the book is wonderful, however the reader Buck Schirner is the worst audio book reader I have ever heard. My husband and I are frequent listeners to audio books and have made it a nightly ritual of going to bed an hour early to enjoy a good story. We have found having a good reader is just as important as the content of the book. We have experienced poor readers in the past, but never had to stop listening until now. We didn't make it past the first tape and I am returning it to request the paperback."
4,Teen sleuthing,"Book number three in the Nancy Drew series, THE BUNGALOW MYSTERY, is actually a smart and sassy little whodunit. Actually, that's incorrect. It is well known who ""dunit"". The book is about how Miss Nancy is going to right the wrong as she untangles the numerous machinations of the villains--in this case, the Dowds. There is considerable melodrama but that only adds to the excitement--each chapter ending with a cliffhanger. Unfortunately, I have read very few of these novels so I'm unable to put it into context with the rest of the Nancy Drew mystery empire.... I found the book not only fun but quite literate."
4,"The Applewood ""Just as you remember them"" are a godsend!","I am really enjoying reading the original Nancy Drew books that Applewood Publishers has been turning out.The illustrations by Russell Tandy are great!I read the whole series 20 years ago in grade school.Now I'm a teacher and getting a kick out of collecting these books and rereading them!The language from the 30's is hilarious.The language is dated, but a scream to read these books. A real piece of Americana.If you loved these books as a child, reread the originals, they are far superior."
5,a suspenseful book,"this book is as good as the others! carolyn keene has really outdone herself this time. in the 3rd mystery, nancy meets a new friend who thinks that her guardians are trying to steal from her. as nancy unwinds the mystery and gets herself in a perilous situation in an old bungalow, she finally solves the mystery. i don't want to spoil the ending, but i'll tell you one thing....it's a really good ending!"
5,A real page turner !,"Very interesting book. A book that everyone should read. Very easy going, simple and poetic. The novel written by Yaacoub depicts an alluring plot between two persons living in two different countries with two different mentalities. Through their e-mails and chats, they connect almost daily, telling each other what happened through the day. The interesting part is when it gets beyond that, thus making the reader connect with them too. Each seems to be looking for the right person but none is able to give up their philosophy and ideals. It is partly poetic and partly down to earth. I liked especially the part where Wolf, one of the main characters, writes his ideas in a poetic manner (in italic).Yaacoub is trying to get his readers edgily to the last four days, the last pages of the book. Would that be a turn of events? You'd better read the book to know that, and then to share with everybody else just like me."
2,Epson cartridges are expensive!,"Epson's ink is great but very expensive! I use a continuous flow system for my printer from MIS. Just Google ""MIS"" . (Midwest Ink Supply)."
1,Very overrated,"I thought the actors were better than the script, and I thought the script was artificial, wooden and deadly dull. It simply was not funny. I didn't even care much for Judy Holliday (the only reason I watched and then kept a copy of this DVD), who, incidentally, did NOT win an Oscar for this flick! Hepburn was one of the kindest human beings in the theater (in the world!) and Tracy has long been a hero of mine, I love them both, but not in this fast-talking turkey. Only two things got my interest. What was Holliday's intention and did she kill Ewell at the start (I guess that's two things right there), and how did they manage the transexual metamorphoses at the end. I really didn't like it. Really."
4,Classic Ford western,"Totally underrated, but, great to see it finally out on DVD. I have to wonder if two well known actors would have carried this to even higher critical acclaim, although, the use of two character actors made in more believable at times. A hidden gem that all western fans should watch."
3,Wagon Master,"I rate this as a mediocre film with a mediocre plot.I would not say that this was one of Fords better accomplishments. It didn;t hold my interest at all, and I haven't still, watched the whole thing at one time.I was very disapointed.Ken L"
2,Completely Unnecessary,This album is unnecessary -- the covers are uninteresting because they add nothing to the originals.
1,Stubby Ratchet,"It didn't work as good as I wanted, it was sticky when cranked it not smooth, then one day it froze not worth buying."
1,Huge disappointment,"I'm a big TMBG fan, and usually enjoy their brand of child-like kitsch. But here they cross the line between child-like and childish. The fact that they are capable of so much more, and are clearly doing this on purpose, doesn't change the fact that this album is terrible. You might as well go out and buy a Barney CD. It would sound about the same."
2,Hattie steals the Dinner Party!!,"throughout her career I have found Hepburn to always rattle on too fast and breathy... signs of a nervous performance but that is the last characteristic of this well founded famous talent, so what's the deal? Dinner scene was akin to nails on blackboard and how this Hollywood ending made ANY sense after such an extreme display of low self esteem, the book knows better... Hattie shamelessly gnawing on gum, fidgeting with the flimsy maid doilie hat, and expressing disgust in no uncertain terms made the most impressive honest delivery in the film, recommend for her performance alone!"
2,Not as good as before,"I couldn't finish this novel. While it does have the great benefit of introducing the Hardly Boys, this story isn't as humorous as the first book. Also, if I had to read one more description of someone's darling outfit, I was going to set fire to my closet."
2,UGGGGH....,"I bought all the Atomic Rooster albums as they were issued, beginning in 1969. Each one got progressively worse as the band went through personnel and stylistic changes with every album. This final album (issued as ATOMIC ROOSTER IV in the U.S., even though it was their 5th album) just hits the dirt. 60's R&B; singer Chris Farlowe is still around for this album, unfortunately, and really drags it down. Chris Farlowe singing songs about Satan? Gimme a break. By this time, Atomic Rooster had completely made the transformation from prog/hard rock band to dull prog/blues band. The only decent thing here is their cover version of ""Voodoo In You,"" which raises the rating to 2-stars.The Rooster re-grouped in the 1980's with earlier members and recorded a decent album. NICE & GREASY remains their least-successful release."
3,"Ok, but not punchy enough for me","I had some money to spend and was kicking around the idea of buying a Messer Chups album or a Messer Für Frau Müller album. It turns out that I got 2 of the former and one of the latter. Both groups enjoy cheesy 60s genre films and their soundtracks. However, Messer Chups is more edgy. Their music jumps right out at you and engages. The samples and the incredibly cheesy theremin and nods to 60s horror soundtracks really grab my attention and put a smile on my face. Messer Für Frau Müller is doing a similar thing, but they are more restrained. When listening to their album, I found my attention drifting. In a sense Messer Für Frau Müller is like a cross between Messer Chups and elevator music. If I wanted to read a book with something playing in the background, I would play Messer Für Frau Müller. If i wanted to listen to music just to appreciate and enjoy it, I would choose Mr. Chups."
2,"Don't Special Order, just forget it","This CD is available only by special order. Don't bother. The sound is very bad and the performances are lethargic. Laserlight, owned by Delta, produced many great CDs at extremely low prices. My first three CDS were all Laserlight and I still have all three and enjoy them very much. But this Laserlight came out many years later and it is a real bomb."
1,Another word of critique,"Borring sums it up but this setting requires a minimum of words. So to satisfied here are some meaningless word. Ah, done."
2,Excruciating!,Hundreds of pages of mind-numbing descriptions of airplane and aircraft carrier technology. Might be appreciated by pilots or military hardware wonks.
3,OK only,Story to technical and not enough action in story line.Tends towards a non fiction story.too easy to read and keep you enthralled.
4,A good read for flyers,Interesting and exciting carrier flying information surrounded by a rather weak love story. Well written yarn that explains life and procedure on an aircraft carrier clearly enough for civilians
4,Good story,Always wondered how Jake met Callie; now I know how it went! Very good read and easy and informative. Looking forward to more.
2,It was pretty boring.,"You'd have to be a pilot to appreciate this book. All of the flying minutia and acronyms destroy the reading. While there are some sequences that are engaging, the rest of the book is pretty boring."
5,Exactly what the little guy needed,What can I say great shoes and a competitive price. These shoes take the rough beating that a toddler can levy on shoes. They look great and are easy to clean given they are waterproof.
3,Too Big!,"This product fits way too big! I was disappointed by the lack of information about fitting. However, the product shipped fast. Just keep in mind that you should buy this product a size smaller"
5,Great classic boot!,This boot is very classic and stylish. My four year old son loves his boots and it matches all of his wardrobe.
3,Sizing...,They came in the correct size but are at least a half size larger than my other size 5 big kids Timberland 6 inch boots... LOTS of extra toe space and they are wider.
4,"John Garfield is great as your basic, blue-collar, hard-nosed noir guy.","He's known as Kit by his many friends, some who had given him up for dead. He's a traumatized POW from the Spanish civil war. He has been mentally & physically tortured by the Nazis for two years in Spain several years before WW II. He has PTSD in today's parlance. They were seeking a flag, a standard of some sort. He had it, they wanted it. He wouldn't give it up. He still knows where it is. Back in New York he is seeking the killers of his best friend & man who sprung him from prison. He is also hunting his tormentor who is also in The United States. The movie was made in 1943 but takes place in 1940 before we were at war. He careens from scene to scene, parties, night clubs, drawing rooms, women's apartments, trying to prove that his friend Louie did not commit suicide as the police believe. Lots of beautiful women, including Maureen O'Hara as Toni. Compelling villains you'll love to hate."
2,MORE HORNS THAN GUITAR,"I found a copy of this after reading the review, After listening to it I was disappointed, the guitar is weak. The vocals are alright, the horns seem to take the lead instead of the guitar. The songs are also weak nothing that really catches your ear. I also have his other cd (Bent Out Of Shape) it is a little better, overall if I had heard them before buying, I would not have bought either. This must be why he only has two cd's out. Like always this is just my opinion."
2,The scent that doesn't last,"I have the after shave of this, so thought ""Hey, why not get the cologne to complement it?"" I spray my normal 3 sprays on my body, and 5 minutes later, there is absolutely no scent of this left at all. Maybe I just received a bad bottle, but I'm really disappointed with this one."
2,"Not for ""nonspecialists""","The cover states the book is for ""students and nonspecialist"", which I found to be not true. The best example was in the chapter Metaphysics, if you do not already understand the concepts and especially Aquinas` arguements before reading the book you will definitly not understand them after reading the book. I felt the book confuses much more than enlightens."
3,What a headache this has been,"I purchased this camera over a month ago and I have had nothing but headaches when it comes to the software. My intention on purchasing this camera was to burn extra dvd's just in case the original dvd was damaged. After spending weeks on my pc and speaking with tech support with Pixela it was determined that my 6month old DVD burner was not compatible with their software. Now I have tried to use two other software programs but they will not recognize my camera being plugged in. I am at a loss as to what to do next. If I can't burn extra dvd's I don't care to have the product. OH and don't even attempt to contact Sony for support you will just get the run around. As for the camera I am pleased I am just having problems with the camera to pc operation. If you are purchasing for plug and play you will be fine. The compact design is great, I carried it on my fanny pack all over Disney World."
2,Product works...barely - no support,"Bought this for my old Toshiba Infinia machine. Works but still have system board conflict. Can't install Linux since doesn't recognize drive. Have 2 tickets into them, first one for Win95 problem was entered 10 days ago with no response.Recommend trying different vendor that supports their product."
4,Great but missing things,"I have been a long-time fan of The McCoys' two psychedelic albums from the late 60s. Infinite McCoys is incomplete here -- missing two tracks. Since the only other digital release is now a very expensive CD, I have to go back to my old cassette copy of the vinyl to hear ""Hell"" and ""Melodrama"". The second lp, ""Human Ball,"" is presented complete. Still, since this is not expensive and the music is terrific, this is highly recommended. Listening to this music is a thrill, because these guys have it down, and their arrangements are terrific, vocals fine, and ideas superb. Get it!"
5,First brazilian recording of Joo Donato since the early 60's...,"...and it's absolute genius at work! Donato plays electric piano here and frequently takes lead vocals, with an absoltely impressive ensemble (which unfortunaly is not identified in the brazilian release, which I own).The highlights here are ""Amazonas"", which would be recorded later by Nara Leo in the LP ""Meus Amigos So Um Barato""; ""A R"", which later would receive lyrics by Caetano Veloso; ""Até Quem Sabe"", which Gal Costa would also record later; and last but not least, the special guest singer Nana Caymmi, singing ""Mentiras"". Everything with great arrangements by Gaya, Laercio de Freitas, Dori Caymmi and Donato himself!Principally thanks to Joyce, Joo Donato has been rediscovered in Brazil lately. Anyone that wants to listen to an younger Donato will be extremely satisfied with this release. Grab it now!"
5,"Long Lasting, must have for DCRVX2100 and others","I purchased two of these over the past couple of years to go with the two Sony DCR-VX2100's that I used as a wedding videographer. No matter what wedding or event I shot at, this battery did great - and I never once had to change batteries, even when shooting the long 8+ hour daylong events. I would also take one of these with us for our vacations, and would not need to recharge the battery for the whole 5+ day trips, of course just using the camera an hour or so each day.Great purchase and ""investment"" in these long lasting batteries."
1,Total fake - dangerous,"Don't buy this if it's not actually SOLD by Amazon, but by Peridigm. Just received two knock-offs today. They don't work with the infoLithium system to give run-time info and they get REALLY hot when charging. Our true Sony batteries which cost only $2 more each, run slightly warm and give real runtime info. For $2 more buy the real thing. These are fakes. Amazon should remove Paradigm as a seller."
1,"Great book, horrible reading","When I saw Ethan Hawke was the reader for this classic, I couldn't wait to check it out. When I brought it home and hit play, I was confused. Ethan reads the ENTIRE book an a near monotone WHISPER! I don't know if he was whispering because it was a stylistic choice, or because he wanted to save his voice, but it ruined the book. As a comparison, there is a clip of Vonnegut reading after a short interview at the end of the book, and it was a tremendous improvement.I was heartborken such a gifted actor delivered such a terrible reading.Do not buy!"
4,Not my cup of tea.,"As a reader, I enjoy a novel that spins a vast plot and investigates characters. Slaughterhouse-Five fails to do that. The book lacks the infra-structure that supports great writing.The book does, though, carry some philosophical meaning. The character's experiences with the aliens did shine a light on some of my own practices and beliefs.All in all, the book is difficult to follow and hard to define. However, it should continue to be read and studied. Perhaps I just didn't get it."
4,An interesting novel of life and war.,"Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time. He can flip around randomly throughout his life whereever he wants to go. He serves as a chaplain's assistant in World War II, is captured by Germans, survives the largest massacre in European history, the fire bombing of dresden. It's so ironically funny at times. It was interesting, finding out how billy came up with his delusions."
3,Slaughterhouse-Five,"Although Slaughterhouse-Five was somewhat graphic, it was well written. Throughout the story, three different time periods were going on all at one time, but the story still flowed well. You were able to get inside the mind of the author, which was not a place I would like to be very long. The book was different than any I've ever read, but we all need variety on our bookshelves, don't we?"
2,Worse than expected,When I read this I expected a very powerful novel. What I got was trivial and tedious novel. Not the worst book I ever read but certainly one of my least favorite books.
5,MIND-BLOWING!!,"This was an amazing experience!! I read Sirens of Titan and wondered to my self what the hell this guy was doing writing an anti-war book. Then I realized it was more than that when I started reading it.. A LOT MORE!!!! The story was entertaining, surreal, sad, disturbing, and trippy all at once. I recommend it...reading this was an experience in and of itself! So it goes."
2,I didn't like it,I don't think the book was very good. It didn't have any tension at all. It is an anti war book that didn't show the really bad sides of war. I think it shows how thinks that happened not only in war but mostly in his family and surrounding screw up his life. I wouldn't want to read it.
2,Slaughterhouse-Five,"I was disappointed with the book. I was expecting a description of the fire-bombing of Dresden, but there was very little, if anything, of the fire-bombing itself.I purchased the book from Amazon with my Kindle."
3,I don't understand the fuss about this novel,"This is the first Kurt Vonnegut book that I have ever read. I was intrigued as it is considered a classic science fiction book so I thought I would give it a try. Vonnegut is clearly a talented writer. The book explored some interesting themes such as free will vs. destiny. It was told in an unstructured way which left me wondering if there was a reason behind it being told the way it was. I also wondered if there was some grand revelation at the end of the story that would explain the popularity of the book. I finished the book and never figured the above out.The book could best be classified as dark humor / sci fi, but the humor didn't appeal to me. The book wasn't a chore to read, but I didn't find it compelling in any way. When I finished it left me wondering what all the fuss was about. It left me with just enough curiosity to want to sample another Vonnegut book, but I am not in a rush to do so."
5,Read this book!,"Obviously an amazing book...anything positive I say is understatement. After reading this I ordered an arm load of other Vonnegut books, and spent hours online reading about the author."
2,"Interesting subject, overrated style","Though this book had an intriguing premise and a fairly unique concept (becoming ""unstuck"" in time), the intrusion of the book's self-proclaimed author during the Billy Pilgrim story grew tiresome. As another reviewer said, this book is ""mercifully short."" The Dresden scene at the end of the book is well-written, though."
3,Interesting but ODD,"This book contains some very interesting thoughts and social commentaries on war, but the timeline, though interesting, skips around too much for my liking. I would reccomend this book to those interested in a thought provoking read, but not to those who have trouble understanding complex plots and metaphorical themes."
3,Cute book,"Note this is review number 433 of this book on Amazon....that says something, no? I liked Player Piano and Breakfast of Champions better, but then I'm not into war stories.There are things to learn here, though. Did you know about the bombing of Dresden? I didn't. I didn't know that more people died in the Dresden bombing than in Hiroshima. Truman's speech, given verbatim in this book (supposedly, I didn't check) was very eye-opening.So the value here, to me, was to learn a little history in a palatable and interesting story. It's much better than trying to read it in one of those dull textbooks (whose authors should be ashamed and stop writing, or try to write like Mr. Vonnegut).By the way, what ever happened to Kurt's son, Mark, the one who wrote about recovering from schizophrenia?Diximus."
3,Book as described but shipping was pitiful!,I had to buy this book for my daughters school project since our local libary did not have it in and I assumed that since the seller lived in the next state over and if I paid extra for premium shipping I should have it within 2-3 days for sure but it took seven days for me to get it via USPS priority shipping ????? I could have driven there and back within 8 hours myself. For what it's worth I sell stuff on ebay and just the week before I shipped an item from Ga to NY via USPS standard shipping and it was there in three days so my only guess here for my daughters book is the seller waited several days before shipping it even though I paid for expedited shipping and I had trusted Amazon and this seller.Live and learn in Ga.
2,R. Covington,"I have heard of this book for years and thought I'd pick it up for my kindle. It is not what I expected for Science Fiction. Not really my kind of read. It jumps around to much for my liking. Too much back and forth in time. I have read other books that handle this style better IMHO. It may have been ground breaking for its time, but it left me disappointed."
1,"Very, very enjoyable","As one of the set books on my university course I found Slaughterhouse Five to be the most enjoyable of the lot (so far)...At heart, Slaughterhouse Five is sf but rated highly on anybody's list because it's not just sf. It's genreless if you like. The point of narrative is constantly changing, the main character, Billy Pilgrim, timetravels to the extent of knowing the time of his own death. Of course, Slaughterhouse Five's theme is war, more precisely the impact of war on the minds of its survivors (Kurt Vonnegut in the driving seat). And the mix of realism with humorous sf makes Slaughterhouse Five one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while. But it."
5,Outstanding Book,"Of all the books I have ever had the pleasure of reading, few can match the caliber of Slaughterhouse Five. It is witty, frightening, and unconvential. I had no idea what to expect when I first read the book, but one thing two things that I got out of reading the book were to expect the unexpected, and that everything is related to something else somehow. If you looking for a good read, pick up a copy of Slaughterhouse Five!"
3,slaughterhouse 5,I purchases Slaughterhouse 5 for a gift for my grandson. He wanted this for his birthday and that was why is was purchased.
5,Brilliant Novel,"Billy Pilgrim has to be the weakest hero of any novel ever written and yet he might be the most beautiful. Through his ignorance and innocence we see how stupid war is. To bad Vonnegut did not write this novel earlier, who knows maybe some of our esteemed leaders of the early 60s would have got a hold of it and read it and maybe they would not have instituted a draft and fought a war in Southeast Asia. That is how powerful a novel this is."
3,Much Ado about Confusion,"It seems that Kurt Vonnegut couldn't decide which book he was writing. It was a mix of sci-fi, drama, and humor. About 10 pages were about the fire bombing of Dresden. The rest of the book was pointless drivel to build up to the ten pages he seemed to really want to write.I often found myself thinking, ""oh, that was supposed to be funny"". It wasn't really. I think a couple lines were mildly humorous."
1,SH5,This book is way too confusing and jumps around too much! I don't get it and I can't believe that it was on the school reading list! Its by far one of the worst books I have ever read!!!
1,"One long, rambling, mess",A tangled mess of disjointed scenes and uninspiring ramblings. This is not a work of art. It is poorly constructed and shows no signs of good writing ability. What a disappointment.
2,Time,"I enjoyed the book, but I think it had too much involved in the theory that everything is fated to happen. Plus, there were too many swears. A book can be so much more effective without the swears"
4,Comedy and Tradedy,"Death and comedy in the authors style meet head on, it describes the inhumanity of man but wraps it in a comedic wrapper that the author writes in. anti-war yes. Inteligent as well"
2,"Maybe It WAS Controvesial, A Long Time Ago, Far, Far Away ...","I have heard (and read here) many good things about this book.I was very disappointed.I did not enjoy the ""inventive"" style the author used to emulate the way he thinks Tralfamadorian books would be written like if they had need of books. It was irritating to read the story with the flow constantly interrupted by stanzas with tenuous relationships to one another. I imagine an author with ADHD and Alzheimer's would find this to be a comfortable writing style.The antiwar aspect of the book reminded me of later MASH and Archie Bunker television shows: heavy handed and preachy. A few two dimensional characters delivering the same message, over and over.Though it had little in the way of flow (Tralfamadorian style), I did enjoy reading the longer uninterrupted text parcels in the book. I will probably read at least one more Kurt Vonnegut book, but I hope it is better than this one."
5,I FINALLY FOUND THIS MOVIE. THANKU AMAZON!,i have been looking for this movie for 25 years as aftr my 1st tv view i was captivated! its a beautifully shot fantasy suspense thriller. i was happy to get them both on this disc. im one of few that likes the name as it is a continuation of cat people that just takes a different direction. magical and unforgettable. your cats will LOVE it!
3,Yummy and Satisfying,"How techno-tranced out can one get? Well, listening to Wink's ""HereHear"" will answer any curiosity you may have in regards to this question. The overlay of keyboards, sounds, and beats can hijack any listener's listening pleasure to an unsurpassed level into the musical mind of Wink. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails makes a vocal appearance on the track, ""Black Bomb (Jerry in the Bag)"", while Ursula Rucker soothingly delights you with her vocals on the track ,""Sixth Sense."" Spaced out and trippy, yet yummy and satisfying."
