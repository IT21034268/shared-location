3,Not close to reality,The twists and turns were a little too far fetched. The story of the sightings underwater lost it for me. Not close to reality
5,POSTIVE READING,"John Edward is dynamic! I am so impressed after reading his book ""One Last Time"" he has opened many new doors of exploration for me.I was given John Edward's book ""One Last Time"" along with Jenny Crawford's book ""Through the Eyes of Spirit"" after the loss of my youngest daugther.Both books are contributing toward dealing with my heart ache and grief.I do hope to read more books by both authors.Thank you and God Bless you in your work."
5,I couldn't put it down; I'm now a true believer.,"I was given ""One Last Time"" by a friend recently. In the beginning, I must admit I was skeptical. However, after reading it, I am now a great fan of Mr. Edward. He writes with sensitivity and humor keeping my interest peaked all the way through. Some books/authors make a positive difference in one's life; Mr. Edward accomplishes this with ease."
3,Not As Good As the Real Thing,"Several years ago, I was first exposed to John Edward's ability through a radio show he did in KC. His talent was so impressive that I went out of my way to attend his public reading that evening. It was phenomenal--this guy is the real deal. I saw him the other day on Leeza and learned about this book. I bought it yesterday, read it today, and while it didn't reveal any tremendous insights--many of the stories he related at the public reading--it does give a good feel for what he does and how he works with his gift. However, you really have to see him in action to get a true appreciation for the connections he explains in his book."
2,Wish this was a more focused book,"I purchased this book hoping it would be a great story about the fascinating world of mediumship, but it seems that everyone in this field feels the need to resort to the same stale ""new age"" and ""psycic fair"" mumbo jumbo rather than tell about how the world can benefit from what mediums have to say. This book is another in a long line of ""you too can be a psychic"" books, but many of us want the real dope about what really goes on."
4,Very Interesting.,"I really enjoyed this book. I've watched John Edwards on TV and I always wondered why psychics say they can speak to the dead, but yet when they're trying to do a reading for you, they're sometimes vague. Instead of saying, ""I see Sally"", they'll say ""I see someone with an S name."" I thought they were just trying to get you to say it for them, but this book changed my mind and it explains why they do that.I enjoyed reading the stories of specific readings he did and some of them had twists of fate. I'm a big fan of Ghost Whisperer and if you are too, you'll probably enjoy this book."
3,Good book & unhappy non-believers,"Good read - people are smart enough to figure out what they get from the book for themselves. As for the people who are going on about demons this and the devil that - well they must be unhappy to begin with to even believe in a so-called ""devil"" - God did bless them with a mind that they should actually put to use once in a while - people try to hide behind their interpretation of the bible and push it on others without realizing they could be wrong too - besides that these bible beaters talk so much about demons and devils that I think they actually like them."
2,Unnecessary,"This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's ""Stronger Than Death"" album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of ""All For You"" and ""13 Years Of Grief"" sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of ""No More Tears"" tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. ""Like A Bird"" is the best song Neil Young never wrote and ""Blood In The Well"" shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","The book was decent. We used it for an intermediate CS class on programming language concepts, and it did the job ok. I thought there was too much emphasis on the history of CS, and not enough on the actual concepts. Thankfully, I had an awesome professor and the class turned out great. Some weak points: lots of people seemed to have trouble with attribute grammars, the book's explanation was not good enough. And there were a few remarks about Java which were completely erroneous."
2,Spongebob: There are better Wii titles.,"Fortunately, we rented this one before we bought it. The concept behind the game is fine. Plenty of non-violent puzzle solving activities, but it did not peg our fun meter. The Wii interface developed for this game is pretty flawed. For instance, there is a critical task where you have to activate a wench by twirling the Wii-mote in the air. Spongebob is told to crank hard and fast, which his animated character does. However, it only works if the player twirls it very slowly. Driving games feel pretty awkward too. Animation and graphics are only so-so. As a whole, the game lacks polish. I think most adults would be bored by the game and it won't maintain the attention of a younger audience for long, it certainly did not capture the interest of my kids who are fans of the cartoon. I considered giving this three-stars, but for the price, I think we should expect more from the game developers."
4,good but nothing special,I got this game for my wii and thought it looked preety cool so i bought it and liked it but didnt love it they use the remotes motion sencors well but its not all that fun. like the racing parts. I want it to be a spongebob game not a racing game which is about half the game if i want racing ill play exite truck not this. so overall its a good game and if you like spongebob then get it.
3,Worth Having,"This CD is okay. It's not the bomb but it has some good songs that are worth listening to. I like Oh Yeah and Anyhow. I also want to comment to the person who said that Haddon is being led by Satan because of the song ""A Sinners Prayer."" I believe that he is ministering to those who are lost and need to find Jesus and he's letting them know that God still hears a sinner's prayer. Because we were all sinners before we were saved and filled with the Holy Ghost. I don't think he's singing this song for us who know Jesus because we're not sinners anymore even though we commit sins because we're still in the flesh."
5,"This Album is ""TIGHT""","This album is tight! This album is the best album that I have ever heard. When I got this CD I couldn't put it down. I think that this CD is for young people like me. Because I grew up in the old church that had ""hand clapping, foot stomping, Holy Ghost santified church"". And I don't mind those songs because you need to remember where you came from. But I'm 13 and this album to me is da bomb. And the song ""Oh Yeah"" is just as popular as the ""HEEL TOE""! Everyone likes it and is singing it!"
2,The self promotion is distracting,"Deidrick may have a very nice style and some good lyrics, but the song DeDe is very distracting from the Word. The fact that he sings a song about him self on a ""gospel"" CD and that he has his picture on the front and back of the case is self promoting. If the CD were truly about the Lord and his Word, one would think that he would not promote himself. To me, that one song taints the album making this neither completely a gosped CD, yet it's still not a secular CD--it's something like lukewarm. Just my opinion."
5,"Great blocks, but high price here","These sanding blocks are great. The remove rust and corrosion from older or neglected tools with ease. I use them to remove rust and then coat with a rust inhibitor (I use Camellia oil or paste wax). The only down side to these blocks is that they are made of an abrasive bound in a rubber matrix. As you sand little rubber/abrasive dust comes off leaving little black sands particles all over the floor/bench/table. Not a big deal, I just use them outside or over the floor.Also, the price here is pretty high. They can be had for much cheaper elsewhere. Enter the manufacturer name in a search engine to find their retail website to get them for half the price here."
5,First time Leslie Lafoy reader,I was not disappointed in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Lelie Lafoy makes you feel as though you are right there in the story. You can see the scenes so clearly. The story is very different than anything I have ever read. You can really understand why Maddie does not have any hope for the future. You respect how Rivlan fights against is strong feelings for Maddie and is ethical responsibility. The obstacles that these two have to overcome makes the story that much more interesting. I really like both of them. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a wonderful romance.
1,What???,This is the 3rd album and it sucks. It is broke and what is a Jigga? outta here with that crap.
3,A Disappointment,"Honestly, I didn't get very far into this book before I began to realize that this woman was an imposter. She claims that she used many different methods (diet, yoga/exercise, and Bee Sting Therapy) to completely recover from MS......until you learn that she has only had MS for 5 years, and only the initial attack. Most of us who have MS can say that we recovered completely from our first attack, followed by a period of time (sometimes years) where we were free of the disease. Let's see if she can remain symptom-free for 10 or 15 or 20 years."
1,This is the worst book on the subject ever!,"All I have to say is that this book is the worst book on the subject of MS ever written! The only thing it succeeds in doing is engorging ""Dr"" Pepe's already huge ego and relaying idiotic advice from a woman who has self-proclaimed that she ""healed"" herself from this disease and then in turn makes fun of people with actual symptoms who looked to her for help.I am a big believer in alternative and complementary therapies but this woman is exactly the type of person who gives CAM therapies a bad reputation.After suffering through her long-winded self-love affair with herself, the only thing I took away from this book is that she has too much money and not enough ways to spend it.As someone who has MS and has to deal with that reality on a daily basis I find this book to be insulting, deplorable, and detrimental to the education of others about this desease.This book is awful and full of s**t. I would not recommend that anyone buy this book."
4,Illuminated Letter Design,"This particular book is best used as inspiration for those who are doing scrolls or illumination. The subject matter is primarily ecclesiastical it is the layout of the letters, the embellishments and border designs which are outstanding. I would recomment this book to anyone doing historical scrolls or illumination as a source of design."
3,great product for allergy people but too expensve..,"it is great product for my daughter who allergic to soy, milk, white egg, wheat.but a little pricy..and some package have some thing that we could not chew.. and don t know what is it..be careful for choking.."
2,cookies,I did not care for the ingredients. I have food intolerance and something did not sit well. I gave them away.
4,My kids' favorite allergy-friendly cookie,"My children have multiple food allergies and it's tough finding a store-bought cookie they'll actually eat. We were pleasantly surprised by the gingerbread spice cookies. When fresh out of the box, they're soft, flavorful, and not as grainy as a lot of gluten-free treats tend to be. These have been a big hit during the holiday season. Will definitely buy again."
2,"Not too awful, I guess","I guess I will just have to get used to the bizarre texture and taste of gluten free items. Right now I am discouraged that this is what's available. The flavor isn't too bad, but these are grainy and there's an odd aftertaste - perhaps it's the date paste (if I remember correctly - I don't have the box in front of me). I just ate two, and I won't cry if I never eat them again."
4,Tasty Gluten-Free Cookie!,"This cookie will fit the bill for many on restrictive diets. The only grains in it are sorghum and rice, and it contains no dairy, eggs, or nuts either. They're soft, chewy, sweet, and if your craving is for an oatmeal cookie, it will fill the bill! It falls one star short of five because it does unfortunately contain processed sugar, and occasionally the currents seem very hard."
4,Canon camera does what we need,"This is our first digital camera. It is small & light so we take it with us. Step one to getting the pictures: have a camera. Once we got used to it, it is easy to use."
2,"Compact, but flimsy !","I bought the SD400 two months ago. I had a S410 prior to this. The main reason I upgraded was for the 5 Mega Pixels and SD compatibility. But I realized my upgrade wasn't worth it.Pros:* Compact Size, fits in a palm* Video Quality is great* Outdoor Shots are comparable to any camera in its class* Quick Startup* Decent Battery LifeCons :* My LCD Broke while it was in my pocket and Canon doesn't cover this in the warranty. Repair Costs $110.00* Indoor shots in ""Auto"" Mode were very very grainy* Low Light shots are just pathetic* Although the camera comes with enough manual controls, the camera shake warning comes up very often."
2,BROKEN LCD SCREEN!!!,People are not kidding about the broken LCD problems with these cameras! We picked up our camera this morning to take pictures of our son opening his birthday presents and found our screen was cracked! We didn't do anything to it! We have taken GREAT care of this camera for 1 year. Lots of other people have also had similar problems with the LCD cracking suddenly and for no apparent reason! Beware!
3,"Too much red-eye, but small and quick!","We bought this camera b/c we were dissatisfied with our Sony DSC-P10 (too big and too slow to take pictures). The Canon is certainly nice and small, and nice a quick to take pics, but almost ALL of my flash pictures have red-eye. I've seen in the other reviews that this is a common problem. It can be fixed easily on the computer, but it is a real pain to have to do it with each and every shot! I am also unhappy with how many of my pictures are out of focus. I am half thinking of going back to Sony (except for those darn Memory Sticks...)"
5,Without a doubt the best pocket camera on the planet,"It's great when a product just ""works"". Read the manual to get the full benefit of this great camera."
5,Great Little Camera,"I am no pro. However I must say that I think this camera is great. It fits in your pocket if you don't mind the bulge, or can be worn on your belt if you don't mind appearing a bit geekish. I took some pictures of my Pembroke Corgi and my American Pit Bull Terrier together and they look fantastic blown up on my 17"" imac screen. The resolution is great and the lighting is perfect (I used the auto mode in a partially backlit situation)."
2,"Lovely, with a major defect looming","I love the design of the Elph digitals, and have used mine with much pleasure for a year. As much as I have enjoyed it, mine has ceased to function, due to the very common issue with some of these cameras around a ""memory card error"" which is actually a camera malfunction. A noticable number of digital elphs seem to fail between one and two years of ownership with this error. Cannon has been unsupportive. I should note that mine is the 4MP version...but I direct you to do a search on problems with the SX00 series. It's heartbreaking to enjoy and recommend a little camera like this, and then have it leave you without a financially viable alternative."
4,Quite Awesome! :),"The NEW Canon SD400 Camera is such a great little camera. It is so tiny that you can take it wherever you go without worrying about a huge case with a huge camera in it. Fits perfectly in your purse, and your pocket (although it isn't safe to put it in you pocket).I would reccomend 2 major things to go along with this camera1. A new 1GB Memory Card to store more photos2. A GOOD STURDY CASE. This camera is obviously tiny in size, but also fragile.WATCH OUT!"
1,Panasonic KX-TCA98 Headset,"I have found this product to be totally unusable. The earpiece does not fit well. This maybe an individual problem. However, I do not think so.The microphone appears to be totally inoperable. I was able to be heard only when using an extemily loud voice.I believe this is a manufacturer's problem. I concider this a very poor quality product, certainly not what I expect from Panasonic."
1,Worked for a month or so,Used it maybe 5 charges in a month and then it just stopped working. Threw it out and haven't bothered replacing it with any such charger again.
2,Not the book for the serious birder,"While it is nice to see the birds in the flesh with real-life pictures of them, it is certainly not pratical for use in the field.Some of the pictures are poorly taken and it is highly difficult if not impossible to identify certain birds. Some of the images are back-lit, giving a silhouette of the bird!There is no proper classification and very little info given of the birds - how the juveniles look like, breeding plumage, male/female plumage etc.I suppose it is a good book for the casual birder who would like to know what's chirping outside his apartment window or chalet in the wilderness. It also comes with some interesting information on where to go birding to catch wetland or passerine birds etc.I must commend Strange though for all his efforts into going into the field to capture these pictures - all pictures in the book were taken by Strange - good job Strange!"
4,"Beautiful,beautiful music!!!","""The Scarlet Letter"" is a good film,but the soundtrack is much better.I find it hard to believe that it was not nominated for best score by the Academy.The best themes are:""main title"",hester rides to town"",love scene"",""agnus dei"" and ""i am the father of her child"". Thank you so much John Barry,i am a very big fan of you,and ""the scarlet letter"" is a classic.It is almost as good as ""out of africa""."
1,A horrible book,"Another horrible american production of sailor moon. God! Come on already! Why most every anime be destroyed by being americanized? Why is it sooo wrong for there to be Japanese culture since after all, it is from Japan! This book was terrible! Every time I read the name Serena, I cringed. What's wrong with the name Usagi? So what if it doesn't sound American? Why is that so bad? And second of all the word scouts make me cringe. It's not scouts, they're not girl scouts..., it's senshi, sailor soilders... soilders! You want to read a real sailor moon book? then go buy the real Japanese manga, so what if you can't read it, there are translations on the internet! Another thing... what's up with the young adult catagory? It's made for 7 year olds!"
4,Such talented young girls,"Ok, so i took the chance and bought this cd of a girl group i`ve never heard of before, and i don`t regret it for one second. The best songs on this cd is top quality pop music, some of the best in my big collection. I just wish the rest of the cd was just as good, but unfortunately it has it`s weaknesses, so i`m sorry i can`t give it a top score. Btw, the girls can really sing, that`s for sure!!! I`m really happy for this recommendation from amazon. So, let me rate the songs:1. That`s what girls do: 5/52.On the floor: 4/53. Skin deep: 5/54. Kids In America: 5/5(my favourite yet)5. It`s alright: 5/56 I`ll remember you: 4/57. Here i am: 4/58. Hot: 3/59. I know what i want: 2/510. What are you waiting for?: 5/511.No Secrets: 2/5I strongly recommend this cd to everyone who like happy ""girl group pop"" from 10-15 years back, just forget the weak tracks and buy this cd for what it is at it`s best!!!"
2,This band is going absolutely nowhere,"Ok, No Secrets came to our school about a month ago, so I bought the cd beforehand. I listened to it before the concert and I'm like, ok these girls are completely oridinary. They're just an average group. So I wasn't expecting much at the concert. First of all, these girls are terrible dancers and they LIP-SYNC! Oh god they were so horrible. EVERYONE in our school hated them! I sware to god I will never listen to the cd again. I will PAY YOU to take the cd away."
2,No Secrets their Lead Singer went SOLO,The lead vocalist of this group went solo she has a CD called Believe in Angels Believe In Me. She was the best part of this CD Angel is now solo CHECK HER NEW CD OUT BUY HERE TODAY
3,there r no secrets 2 this album,"this is a pretty good album, i would say. some songs are not that good, but if u like pop check it out."
1,Disappointment,"Honestly, on the whole I would have to say that this album was not that good. There is only one singer who really carries the group through, and the rest are high pitched and nothing special. The songs are superficial and aren't really relatable. A few songs had okay lyrics but the beat and their voices just made you want to turn it off. If you want quality music I would NOT choose this album."
4,Worth 30 Dollars!!!!,"I got this toy with my own money and it was definitley worth it. It can double as a house and a car, and it's a lot of fun. The only part I had trouble with is snapping the green part back on the bus, and the purple lounge part fell of too, but I got it to go back on. The trick is to press the button on the back, and make sure all the pieces are closed up and off. This is a great toy for the money!!!"
4,"Though not as good as the first book in the series,","Sex and the Serial Killer, I enjoyed the book. Just didn't find the hero as compelling as he could be. And the heroine's profession was kooky and a bit unbelievable. still, i'll continue to buy this author, I'm sure she'll be entertaining."
5,Wonderful Book,"This book is an easy to read and funny intructional tool for toilet training your cat. My cat completed the process in about 7 days with 100% accuracy. (Just think of all of the money that can be saved by not having to buy litter.) This is a must have for anyone trying to accomplish the task of feline toilet training. I have had cats all of my life and have never such an easy time in training one of them to anything, much less using the toilet. I highly advise using this book and wish that I would have known about it earlier. Thank you Dr. Brotman."
3,"Great book, wrong book...","Unfortunately, while I love any book Schone Regan, a fellow ACN writes, this is for the prior server system and not the book I thought I was ordering. For those looking for training in last gen. server, it will be fine."
3,Broke quiet easily,"I tried to remove front sight post to install holographic sight on M4, one prong broke off, I had to finish with needle nose pliers... ruined front sight post. Borrowed a friends to install holographic post.It could of been front post, it became a little tight near the end... never had this issue before on other similar weapons M16A1/2/3. Maybe I got a poorly manufactured 1 out of 100's...???"
3,It's ok,It did not fit my aftermarket 45 deg site and I had to chuck it up in the drill press and file/sand the diameter down a bit.
5,Solid tool,"This one is just as good or better than the Tapco in my opinion. The handle, being a bigger diameter, feels more solid in the hand. I got this one for the 4 prong side, which worked well for adjusting the elevation on my Sig M400. I wanted the 5 prong in case I ever run into sights that require it. This is one to consider if you want a streamlined, yet solid tool."
2,The Leaky Mug,"The main problem with this mug is that the cover doesn't fit tightly. Liquid can seep through, and occasionally drips on me when I'm drinking. It's fine with the lid off, but of course then it doesn't insulate as well. Not that it insulates all that well even with it on, and not that I expected great insulation either way. It's just a cup, not a vacuum bottle.Oh, it also seems to hold closer to 16 ounces."
5,Another Great Munsch Book,"Once I saw a Munsch book that dealt with a child in a wheelchair, I just had to get it for my daughter. We just got her first wheelchair and it was a great book to not only have her look at the pictures, but to read to other friends and family that see her in her chair and I see they are curious about it. It was a fun book and it's great to see a book out there that shows children with a disability having fun. I'm sure once she outgrows the wheelchair she has now, she will want a super fast one just like the girl in the book! Umm, thanks. :)"
4,Fun Toy at a Great Price,"Got this as a stocking stuffer; appears to be as ordered. Grandson loves anything to do with CARS, so it will be a hit with him."
1,Worthless!,"My advice, Go spend MUCH LESS on Expert At The Card Table and keep this Penn & Teller related JUNK on the bookstore shelf."
4,I think it's a good CD,"It has the three songs that I was interested in. I know some people are griping about the quality of the tracks, but when compared to my other Righteous Brothers CD, this one is by far the better of the two. In fact, I don't hear any quality issues. Granted, I don't have top of the line speakers, but it sounds great to me."
2,'47 Logo on MLB Authorized Cap?,"If I pay $20+ for an official MLB hat, the only logo want on the outside of my hat is my team's. I can't believe '47 brand had the balls to put their own logo on the side of this hat. Ruins that hat for me. What a stupid decision and I can't believe MLB allows it."
2,Aura Cacia Sandalwood Oil is Mostly Jojoba Oil - Deceitful Advertising,I believe the description of the essential was inaccurate because it has a *little* bit of Sandalwood in Jojoba oil. Its mostly Jojoba oil. No where on description did it state is was Sandalwood in Jojoba oil I believe this is false advertising and Amazon should make sure that all ingredients are listed UP FRONT. I don't know how much Sandalwood oil is actually in there and I would not have purchased it if I had known it was mostly Jojoba oil and a bit of Sandalwood oil. I feel deceived.
3,"my favorite recipe, but no others","My favorite meal is this book's Sweet Potato Soup with cornbread. But I have used it for little else. As with many older cookbooks, vegetarian or not, most recipes depend on eggs and cheese. If you're looking for actual *veggies*, try _The New Vegetarian Epicure_."
1,Not Happy,"First of all, the cover was deceptive. I knew I was looking for the first book written; however, after I'd placed the order I saw that it was Book 2. I don't know if the book is good or not as I was not interested in this edition. Just disappointed with the fact that the book advertised isn't what I received."
4,Not just for vegetarians,"This is just a great cookbook. Recipes are rich, colorful, and flavorful. Not just for vegetarians, all good cooks will enjoy this classic."
5,Required Reading!,"I keep this book handy to educate clueless people who just listen to the ""news"" each night.It is loaded with earth facts, and dispells the popular myths of today, that man has the power to change the climate.We don't.We are arrogant for thinking we can. The environmmental movement if a home for Socialists, just follow the money.But this book and prepare to be angered by how manipulated you have been. You are taxed to death for the ""environmental good"" that has no meaning. What dopes we all are."
5,Insightful,This book takes a cold hard analytical look at some of the biggest scares of our time. It then shows us the real impact of these issues. It even shows how simple the remedies to them can be when politicians and some scientists aren't trying to shake us down for more funding for issues that don't need major funding.
4,Generally a Great Book,"Patriots vividly brings to life the men behind the Amerucan Revolution. It deals in depth with the causes behind the war, but it's only drawback would have to be the way in which Langguth quickly wrapped up the war by spending only about a hundred and fifty pages on the years between the Declaration of Independence and the British defeat at Yorktown. All in all though, Patriots is an excellent book."
5,An amazing book!,"Who knew the story of the men who started the American Revolution could read like this! A real page-turner. If you think historical writing is dry, try this one! Patriots is one of the most rewarding reads I've had in a long time. Highly recommended!"
5,Lego never disappoints,"My son got this yesterday for his 7th birthday and spent most of the day building dinosaurs. It is one amazing kit. He will be busy for months building all the ideas that came in the booklet. It is challenging enough for a 7 year old and even his 11 year old sister was excited about building something. I can only say that if your kid likes dinosaurs or Lego, this is the kit to get. Lego rocks !!!"
5,Life without Life,"NBC....Classless network,Run by IDIOTS!!! They had one great show and they cancel it. LIFE was truly a rarity on television. Well written and superbly acted. I will miss this show...oh well maybe it will be resurrected by cable...one can only hope."
5,My favorite detective series,"I really loved this show, NBC is totally bizarre in that they put really good shows on the air, and then pull them. I will never understand."
5,This is NOT a regular studio album,"This album is very ethereal and chilled out. A very nice listen when trying to relax.Keep in mind, however, that this album is NOT a regular studio album. ""Prologue"" (Original German title: ""Album Die Einlassmusik"") is simply the music Schiller plays at the beginning of the concert at the entrance to ""get you in the mood"" for the real music."
5,I love it!,"I can't find this anywhere in Salt Lake and I love the smell. Everything is either lemon or orange scented and it's just so overpowering and sweet. The almond has a nice scent, but not overpowering and it cleans well."
4,Compatible with 5.8GHz phones,"This headset works great with my AT&T; 5840 5.8GHz handset. It states on the packaging that it is compatible with 900MHz, 2.4GHz, and 5.8GHz analog/digital phones. I can hear clearly and can be heard very clearly. The only negative is there is no volume control, the headband does not adjust, and the microphone cannot adjust to come closer or go further away from your face. That said, this headset works very well and I haven't been able to find any other headsets that state they are compatible with 5.8GHz phones.As for the KX-TCA60 that everyone raves about, I bought it first based on the reviews and price. However, the TCA60 did not work with my 5.8GHz phone and the packaging states that it is compatible with 900MHz and 2.4GHz analog/digital phones only. This information is not on Amazon.com.So if you have a 5.8GHz phone I would stay away from the TCA60 and go with the TCA86. It's a great buy and works very well."
2,works but barely,"After using the headset for 2 weeks I've come to the conclusion it's simply poor quality. I've tried the set on two different phones and they both yield the same results, poor muffled sound quality. It appears the person being talked to hears me alright so I can only assume the microphone works properly. I would not recommend this to anyone that might have the slightest hearing problem at all. Might be good for a young person without any hearing issues or frequencey response deficiencies."
5,Excellent,"Excellent Quality and price, i use to have other panasonic model with volume adjustment, but found out it is useless as i have never used the volume adjustment and was always kep to max on the headphones. just go for this one if you are looking for simple headphome with reasonable price."
4,Panasonic telephone headset,"Headphones are light, comfortable. Sound quality is good. There is occasionally an echo. Can't beat it for the price."
2,Consider this disposable,"This bike cover is sufficient at first, but, after owning it for a while, I see that it has some major flaws. It doesn't cover the wheels entirely, it doesn't fit back into the zipper pouch once opened, and it tears like crazy after a while. I've considered duct-taping the inside where all the holes are, but then I ask myself: why don't I just buy a better quality bike cover?"
4,Better than expected,From some of the comments I thought I would have a size problem. I got a mountain bike cover for my road bike and it covers it well. All the way over the pedals. Is also holding up so far in the inclement weather we have had of late.
4,Good Value for Price you Pay,"i bought these headphones for 4.99+Free Shipping, Sound Quality is Pretty Good, Volume is quite high for watching any programms on my laptop. as mentioned it comes with extra Bass. Overall Much better product compare to any product you buy at doller store."
4,Long Johns for Wilbur!,"Bought these for my little 12 yr old pug who gets very cold. Even though it is hard to fit a pug ""shape"" and I had to do some alterations on these, they are great for the chilly days coming here in Minnesota. He doesnt mind wearing them all the time."
4,Awesome,"I don't know what it is about this thermal, but when I put it on the dog he goes insane. He loves it. It changes his life. He rolls around with his tail going all over the place... he gets so happy.Pros:*Loves it.*Keeps him warm.*Looks awesome in it.*Easy to wash & does not shrink in the dryer.Cons:*Legs always come out of the back (seems to be common).*Buttons on the back don't last long.By far, the best piece of clothing I have purchased."
3,Too small,"Very cute PJs for pup, but they were quite small for mine, even though I followed the size chart recommendation. They're thin like a waffled t-shirt, and they have leg sleeves as well so the back legs hold them on well. Good for indoors during cool weather."
3,THIS IS NOT RUSH,"Just a word of warning, this is not an album by the Canadian band Rush, as I was led to believe. I guess the people listed who also bought other Rush albums were duped the same way. The CD isn't bad, but it's not Lifeson, Lee and Peart!"
4,sexy but a bit tight,these shoes look great but they're not available in half sizes so i went with 7's (i'm actually 7 1/2) and they're a bit tight. the laces also don't really stay up too well but maybe my tying technique is wrong or something.overall very nice :)
3,So so audio player,"A well thought out player, unfortunately it is limited in a big way by a maximum of 9,999 files, (anything readable by the X5.) Bummer! I chose the Toshiba Gigabeat F60. It has some issues but it is capable of holding up to 15,000 tracks. It works for me anyway, maybe not for you."
3,could be better,"I bought this book - and expensive it is, too - hoping to find many of the actual interviews listed. All I got was a summary, showing date, publication and not much else. The discography has a number of errors - and when you pay this money, you expect perfection!"
2,More Questions Than Answers.,"Mr.Forczyk said it all. Granted that both the written and archaeological evidence is choppy at best. Still Mr.Sekunda failed to answer any pertinent questions. Yes, the Greeks were victorious and the Persians got hammered. We all knew that before we picked up this book. He does not give any insights into the how and why this campaign went as it did. He did not even present a cogent theory. I give the color plates and maps 4 stars and the text 2."
2,"Pleasing to the eye, frustrating to read.","As a coffee table book, 'Designs' is an excellent and pleasant pictorial example of silver jewelery from around the world. As a reference work for a collector 'Designs' at more times than is acceptable is a headache to read. Attempting to determine which of the illustrations fit the authors descriptions is time consuming and should be unnecessary.This problem is evident in the photos of multiple pieces and in the good, better, best sections. For reference purposes, order is lacking. For good, better, best selection, information is lacking.As a jewelery catalog, this book passes muster. As a reference work, I will return the book to its owner and will not purchase a copy for my own modest library."
3,"Nancy Schiffer's ""Silver Jewelry Designs""","I collect silver jewelry--mostly Mexican & bought this book as a reference.I think the photos are great, especially the colorful ones in the first part of the book on Arts & Crafts, Art Nouveau, & Art Deco jewelry, however, the ""Values Reference"" price guide in the back is very poor. There are no prices listed for many of the pieces shown in the book & the descriptions in the price guide often don't quite match up with the descriptions accompanying the photos, so it is hard to determine the correct price. Also, I think some of the prices quoted are way too high if you compare the prices in the book with, for example, prices on E-bay.If this book is ever republished, I think the ""Values Reference"" should be totally revamped & I think the photo captions should follow a more logical order--such as from top to bottom or clock-wise. In the present edition they often don't.Buy this book for the lovely photos, but if you need a price guide I don't recommend it."
1,Save Your Cash!!!!,"All this release is, is a packaging of the Maximum KISS CD (garbage) and the Kiss and Sell book. Most fans have both already so save your $$. There isnt any special packaging or anything, just the book and the CD. Skip this one!"
2,Not worth the money.,"I had to buy this book for a forensic anthropology course. The book is a series of scientific articles about skeletal biology that at times can be interesting, but are overall dry. This is probably a classic medical book - tough language, deep concepts, hard to understand in general."
4,A wasted effort,"This is a missed opportunity on this set. Instead of giving casual fans a place to turn beyond 40 Greatest Hits, this is full of non-session takes with a few songs that were placed on there at the time to snag the completist (""I'm Not Comin' Home Anymore"", ""Tear In My Beer"" & ""All The Love I Ever Had"") and several other excellent, but out of place, alternate takes.Missing are his entire output with Audrey (one radio show cut makes it on here) and his Luke the Drifter takes (""Ramblin' Man"" is included since it was close to Hank's regular style). Also missing is ""I'm Satisfied With You"".Once again, it's a wasted opportunity. Instead of offering a cohesive collection of Hank material for the casual fan, Polygram once again chooses to bog it down with non-session takes."
4,Nice product..Good price,"This was just what we where looking for. It's big, light weight and nice finish on it. The color in the pic looks a little orange to me, actual color is much darker oxblood as described. Highly recommended."
4,fun game,if you like games and if you like to just get into them this is a cool game to play with a group of 6 to 8 players and everyone seems to get louder and louder and it is fun.
2,Disappointed,"When i saw these earrings i immediately fell in love with them. I thought they were really pretty for my 11 year old neice in law especially because she loves pink and butterflies. But when i opened the box they were TINY!! I mean really tiny!! I was expecting them to be at least average size. I would recommend these for maybe a little girl between 7 or 8,"
2,it is tiny!!!!!,"It does not like the picture, it's size is very very very very very small and the color is not the same as the photo~disappointed&#65281;&#65281;"
2,Too short a rise,It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise. It looked good but wasn't comfortable. Had to return it.
4,Bob plays the flute,"After some gentle coaxing from the interviewer , Bob plays a short flute ditty. This alone makes the CD worth purchasing."
5,an excellent novel,I loved this book. My favorite part was when Sara pretended to be Lottie's mother. You learn that you don't have to look like a princess to be one.
5,OnE oF mY FaVoRiTe BoOk,it is one of the best book i ever read. i really like sarah because she's really nice and a very good storyteller. i wish i could see the movie.tHe bEsT BoOk eVeR
1,Don't be fooled,If you think ME illustrated this great book (you can't look inside because it is still sealed in plastic in the bookstore) you're wrong. Only the cover is illustrated. What a rip-off
4,great CD,"This CD is really good. Fiona's voice has a lot of strength. Songs like Sleep to Dream, Shadowboxer, Criminal, and my personal favorite, Never is a Promise, show off her talent. Some songs are bitter, but they exhibit her vocal power. Upon the release of her new CD I must ask, Why have you waited so long to buy this CD?"
4,Somberzzzz... .,Two great songs criminal and sleep to dream are great. the rest is somber and a little bit to coffee house for my taste. Great price and worth the money.
5,Excellent,"This is one of te best CD's I own, I have listened to it almost every day since I bought it, about 5 years ago. Fiona's deep mellow voice and trippy rhythms are hypnotizing, especially on ""Pale September"" and ""Slow Like Honey"". Fiona takes you through every range of emotions throughout all the tracks. Every song can be related to something in your life at any time. I continue to buy this album for gifts for my friends. Fiona Apple conveys soul and emotion with everything she does, comparable to Billie Holiday."
2,It's not that craked up as it was made to be!,"i found four songs that i liked on the whole cd. maybe i am just too picky but doesn't seem like she sings over the same things?i don't know but if your thinking about buying this cd...save your money and buy her singles. don't waist $15.00 like i did...if i had known i would have just bought the single of shadowboxer, criminal, sleep to dream and maybe sullen girl. please hear the cd on amazon before you waist your precious money.because i gave the cd two stars is that i like four songs on it and i must give Ms. Apple that credit. she is very talented but i think she should have thought about the music she was putting on her record first."
2,boring!,"i THOUGHT this album was going to be one of my favorites when i bought it, but when i listened to it, i found that it was just way too BORING. and what is with her voice in ""never is a promise""? she needs to seriously take the money she is making from this album and invest it into some singing lessons."
5,A Star is born,"My Grandaughter first told me about Fiona Apple. I watched her video Criminal on MTV and immediatly thought what a voice and what piercing blue eyes!! I got the CD listened to it many times and realized this is pure talent, nothing trumped up to make her sound better than she is, no instruments to cover up a faltering voice,just pure honest talent.This God given talent will take her as far as she wants to go.The only other female singer I thought this much about was Linda Rondstat, another pure talent."
2,What was I thinking?,"I must have had a brain cramp the day I bought this c.d. Usually I wait until I hear a few songs from and album before I purchase it. Unfortunately I liked ""Criminal"" for about 2 seconds, and I shelled out the bucks. It's not that this is exactly a bad c.d., it just fails to strike the right chords. Every song on it is sooooo close to likeable that I have listened to the c.d. more than once, in an attempt to enjoy the music. Sadly, this is the only c.d. I have ever regretted buying."
2,"Two and a half, actually","When I first heard Fiona Apple's voice it stopped me dead in my tracks. She really does have a beautiful and captivating voice. Unfortunately, her song writing doesn't follow suit. Most of her lyrics are pretentious and trite. Although her voice betrays her age, her songwriting and arranging completely give it away. It might be worth it to buy it used, but let's put it this way; I lent this CD out to a fellow employee who quit shortly thereafter and of course, took my CD with him. I found I didn't miss it."
3,talented but overrated,"she has talent and the music has potential but this music is really not my type and fans are overrating her like she is the best thing to happen to music or going even as far as calling her the best artist of the 90's. I think there were much better artists than her in the 90's though she's alright in her own way. I think Jewel and Sarah McLaclan were much better than her as were Mariah Carey, Mary J Blige, Janet Jackson and Alanis Morrisette. I like my music to have melody and soul in addition to good music and songwriting."
1,THis is sleepy,"Everyone is like Fiona this and Fiona that. No offense to the girl, but her songs are boring and repetative, I thought there was a mistake. Maybe her other albums are better, but I was truly disappointed. One hit wonder. yeah I wonder allright. GOod nite"
3,"Excellant at what she does, but a bit repetitive at times","While laced with a number of very good tracks, there seems to be a disturbingly large amount of filler. If the filler had been chucked out, or replaced with some more original tracks I'd have given it a four. Unfortunately the excessive basic piano driven 'sing about something mildly depressing' style drops it down a point.Some excellant production though, and plenty of sounds to extract through multiple listens. For a debut album, this is fantastic and a great sign of things to come. Don't expect anything too wildly innovative though."
5,THE Ultimate demo disc,"This is the best possible tool to evaluate high-end sound system.It really can pull the last bits of performance out of a system, and makes it almost trivial to identify possible fields for improvement for anyone who has ""sound ears"".The disc also can be used very efficiently to illustrate which term means really what for somebody who is not too familiar with the sometimes awkward and fuzzy Audiophile terminology.It's 5+ stars product."
2,Too obvious,"I'm a bit dissapointed with this book and the rest of the trilogy, because if you've read the rune blade trilogy - you'll already know practically everything that happens. The sword in exile isn't a new trilogy but a copy of the rune blade trilogy.First of all the caracters are all overmesured - too heroic and in the first 50 pages you'll alrady know how the book ends (At least I knew). Each book of the trilogy is like the next one, generation after generation of overmesured heroes."
2,Looks great. Didn't last.,"Love the way this watch looks. Day two of owning this watch: noticed the link at the top of the face was very loose, as it was bent. Also, the back of the watch would not stay on. Returned the item for a full refund."
1,Shocking,As a Bible believing Christian I found this book shocking and of no positive value of someone seeking to know God.
4,Laptop-glitch-IDM-pop that's not just for devotees,"When Aphex Twin presented the world with the Richard D. James album, he posed a question--a challenge really--can anybody else do this? Can anybody else make sonically mind-blowing electronic music that maximizes sonic innovation and listenability at the same time? Nobody has stepped to the plate until lately. Don't get me wrong, I love Kid 606, Autechre, Fennesz, and their ilk as much as the next cat. But this is different--DAT Politics is pure pop--not pure pop in the sense that NSYNC is-- but pure pop that brims and buzzes with the vitality and melody of the music that runs through your head when you're a kid jumping on the bed when you're not supposed to. The melodies are catchy and irresistable. If ever there was a glitch pop party record, this is it. Rank it in with not only the best of the year, but the best of the genre. And keep your eyes on Mum from Iceland if you aren't already..."
1,The 360 is a pile of junk!!,"I have purchased 3 Xbox 360s. The first two had the famous RROD. I told myself that if the 3rd one broke, no more 360s. Sure enough, less than a year it broke. 9 months to be exact. The system turns on,however, it cannot read any DVDs, CDs, and game discs. If I cannot get it repaired, thats it for me, no more 360s. What a piece of junk!!!!! I am most certainly disappointed with Microsoft who apparently does not seem to care about quality. Thank goodness I have a PS 3 to keep me occupied. I have now changed to a Playstation fan."
2,bad buy it breaks a lot,the xbox is a bad buy because it breaks a lot I have already gone through 2 in one year it breaks 100% every 6 months and in between it gives a lot of problems like freezing etc. also if you want to buy a game console it would be better to buy a wii or a ps3 because they are both cheaper xbox cost 400 + 200(4 years online play) = 600 + repairs = a lot of hidden cost compared to wii where nintendo has a good reputation for making consoles that last and if the console breaks in one year they fix it and it is highly unlikely that a nintendo system would break or a ps3 which might cost 600 but that is all you need to pay upfront there is not that many hidden cost like xbox 360
3,ouch!!,"For years I've been a Playstation guy, but I couldn't wait any longer. So I bought the 360 and Oblivion to go with it. I've since played a few others (The Outfit multiplayer I enjoyed the most). This machine is going to need all kinds of upgrades the first being a new fan, the system runs hot after an hour or so, it also needs more memory. It seems to me that Oblivion maxs out the 360, the loading is horrible. Microsoft just lost the console wars. Next gen my butt. I only hope the games get better. My advice, if you're a die hard xbox fan, give it another year before you get a 360."
5,Is this the best game system ever? yes!,"I just bought it yesterday and I have seen the future. Dvds, music, video, and more. This is the best system ever. Buy it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM,"I bought mine today and it froze after 30 minutes. Several different errors, but it won't even boot now and I've owned it for less than 6 hrs. What a rip off. Microsoft is producing a lot of junk and they know it!"
3,Great when it works...,"The xbox 360 is a great system so long as it is up and running. Before buying one though I highly suggest googling on something like: xbox 360 3 flashing red lights. If you haven't heard by now, this indicates a hardware failure and is not at all uncommon. Unfortunately for me, mine occured less than a month after the 90 day warranty expired and am out some serious cash.I loved the system when it worked, and was impressed with its graphics, performance, and overall gameplay. I hate the fact that it broke suddenly and for no obvious reason."
1,"Fun, but destroys games and Microsoft and game makers won't help you.","That's right, the Xbox 360 destroys games and Microsoft does not feel that it is their fault. My Call Of Duty 3 game was destroyed by my Xbox 360. Microsoft told me that I moved the 360 while the game was in the 360 and the 360 was on. I have never moved my 360 while it was on. I am the only person that ever uses my 360. Activision will give me a replacement disc for only $20 and it takes 3-4 weeks for me to get the game back. I am very angry about this."
3,Hi-Tech But Where's the Fun?,"I'm a 'grown-up', but I'm just having a hard time getting into these 'grown up' games on the XBOX 360. I would gladly sacrifice some processing speed or realism to have games that were more fun. I bought the 'best games' that were recommended by the sales rep, but so far nothing has really gotten me hooked on this console. The games I've played have plenty of computer realism (shiny and HD), but not much general entertainment value. The multiplayer games are not really multiplayer. I just want fun games that I can play with my friends without having to read a technical manual to operate a control with 30 buttons. I fear I would get more of the same with the PS3. Wii looks like fun. Maybe I'll trade mine in."
1,Another one bites the dust,It was a nice system with a great library of games until I got the 3 red lights of death 4 months later. I'll be getting a refurb from MS but who knows how long that will last. These systems really are defective. You would think a company with as much dough as MS has could throw the consumer a bone once in a while. But most people that know videogames agree MS is the most money hungry of the 3 console makers. 1. $50 a year to play online. 2. $180 for a proprietary 120 gb harddrive that should cost $100. 3. $50 for 512mb mem card(a thumb drive of the same size is like $10 but MS wont let you use them to save games) Save yourself the frustration and go with the Wii if you need family friendly games or the PS3 which is a superior piece of hardware. Unless you want to pay MS $80 a year just for the privilage of playing the 360. ($50 for xbox live and $30 a year to extend the warranty)
1,"Great games, poorly manufactured product.","Well it finally happened. My 360 lasted almost a year, not quite though. For cutting edge technology I'm fairly disappointed. I'm not much of a console person to begin with but I decided to purchase the 360. I understand they have a return policy now but I think its a bit late for that, considering that I've already sold all my games and invested it into some computer hardware. I'd advise everyone else to do the same."
2,xBox 360 - FIVE MONTHS AND IT DIED ON ME.,"I waited until they fixed all of the bugs because I had heard that there was problems with these units. They came out and said they fixed all the problems, so I bought one. After about three months it started to crash on me, then after another two it died all together. Now becuase I didn't get the extended warranty (I thougth I was paying enough for it already) I am out $150 to get it fixed, plus I have to pay for shipping it to and from Microsoft, who NOW say they don't have enough boxes to ship to me so I can ship it to them.... does that mean they have more broken xBox 360's than they do boxes to ship them back with?My advice, wait until the PS3 - I wish I had."
1,"If you want a ring cycle, Wagner is better","Be warned, you will get the dreaded three red light ring cycle, it's just a matter of when.In our case, it was the day we brought it home. In short this piece of garbage didn't even work properly for one moment. Maybe the QC department was smoking something, I don't know. I do know that until Quality Control becomes a reality, you are advised to not go near an Xbox 360.BTW, we have an Xbox, a PS2 and a Wii. They all work."
2,Problems with Xbox 360!!!,"I purchased my Xbox 360 back in March and now it is DEAD. A complete hardware failure starting with games freezing then finally the ""Red Ring of Death"". I paid $[...] for a premium system bundle and now Microsoft wants $[...] to repair it. The 360 is an amazing console when it works and the online capabilities are unmatched. However, I refuse to give Microsoft anymore of my money to get it running again. So my Xbox 360 will sit on the shelf until Microsoft takes responsibility and issues a recall. Despite the major hardware problems the Xbox360 will reign over all other next gen consoles."
1,"Good games, terrible hardware","I have one, even though it hasn't been in my house for weeks, since it's being repaired. I enjoy the games it plays, although there are a few too many shooters and not enough adventure games. But yeah, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends unless MS fixes the hardware problems. Apparently, they will be soon, but the customer needs to know which one is the new model so they don't end up buying the faulty one."
3,"Fun, but...","i had the great fortune of being able to play the x box 360. it blew me away with its stunning graphics...but...whats new? all it seems to me they did was take the x box, turbo charge its hardrive, and put it in a new case, and of course, change the format of their cd's.and x box isnt the only one...PS3 has fallen into the same state. however nintendo broke away from tradtional gaming and took a risk. microsoft and sony sat down and said, ""How can we make our previous consoles better?"" nintendo sat down and said, ""how can we make gaming better?""P.S. anybody that thinks nintendo is a child console hasnt played resident evil, or metroid prime (which i beleive is the nintendo equivelant of halo) or mortal combat, or a lot of others...back in the 70's 21 year olds played zelda and super mario"
2,Crashing down,"I had my x-box 360 for about a year now. It is fun, a lot of titles to choose from, and I love fact I can download movies and tv shows into my hard drive. BUT now my 360 is acting up. It won't play some of my games, it's getting loader, and my feed tray don't aways open. Besides those problem it's ok."
1,worst system ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! me>:(,im dissapointed i mean its usless without hdtv and its just an xbox with games you cang get on xbox free xbox live so over all i mean come on just buy an xbox want elder scrolls oblivon just get marrowwinds its the same with a couple of pixiles of less grapics so i give this pice of junk a 1 out of five!(just buy an xbox! ).). (
1,On my 3rd Xbox 360,"This is my experience with the Xbox 360, so don't go off commenting about how I'm a fanboy or the problem lies with me not using the system ""correctly"" (you know who you are!), or that I need to hang the 360 from a rope, tie three fans to it so it doesn't overheat and do a voodoo dance to get it to work...Now look people, the Xbox 360 is crazy fun (RB6 on Live Rocks)! I love it and I'll always have one.BUT, it breaks. A LOT. Yes, place it in an open area, not in an entertainment cabinet and make sure it has plenty of ventilation. And for Pete's sake, don't touch it when it's on or the disk with scratch! Treat it with tender love and care.Folks, they last no longer than 6 to 8 months at best. I say go ahead and buy it, but you MUST **get the extended warranty**."
4,great when it works,"The first TWO unit i bought doesn't work. I got blanking red lights. The 3rd was a charm. Now with xbox live, it's great. I got Forza 2, DiRT, Gears of War, Ultimate Alliance. Graphics are great. The best HD video source u can get. In contrast, Comcast HD looks just okay, but downloaded video clips look great. Too bad it can't play HDDVD without buying another device. You almost don't have to buy cames. There are demos to download all the time. It's great to have a bunch of demos and a few arcade games when friends come by."
1,"Good games, great high def. Unfortunately...","My XBOX 360 was purchased in November of '05. I have since then played it, on average, 2 hrs. a day. It has a great selection of games, great controller, and a great interface. However, I recently received the ""red ring of death"", just before they announced the 3 year warranty. As fun as the system is, 4-6 weeks of down time being repaired is just not my idea of normal operating for a product. There are estimates of 25% and 33% hardware failure rate. This is sad. I have a hard time shelling out for more games I may not be able to play in the future. If you decide to buy this product, I would strongly recommend buying a product replacement plan from your store. I know some stores offer them, but it's going to cost you another $60 to $100 dollars. You may as well get a competing console that isn't going to give out after a few months."
3,From good to bad: The story of the 360,"Ok, I'll just say I don't own a 360. My friendhad it and we play it A LOT. Because it was so good! The games on it were amazing! Oblivion, GRAW, GOW, Splinter Cell, and Halo and Halo 2 for the xbox. But of course, every console has a con. The 360's con is heating. And the heat may have something to do with why it dosn't play any game anymore. Yeah, something screwed up the laser and it dosn't load or read games properly. We have tried for HOURS trying to get a game to play on it. Bottom line, this console has some of the best games, graphics, and capabilities out there. But too much technical problems."
1,Just use an XBOX Emulator for your PC!,Waste of money after seeing the specs on this. Download an emulator and buy the XBOX 360 controllers for your PC!
4,XBOX360,"Really nice improvements with online play and other features. The biggest complaint would be the graphics on a non-HD television. Sometimes the menus are hard to read in certain games. This problem does not exist on HD televisions. Other than that, have had no problems with the system. Still an XBOX fan."
3,worked fo a little while,my xbox 360's disc tray malfunctioned and ruined the disc I was playing so I have to get both replaced by microsort and take 2k games.
2,"Great performance, critical flaws.","The Xbox 360 produces amazing graphics, awesome clean audio and tons of additional features. HD images, vids and games are out of this world.However, the Xbox 360 has one unforgivable flaw, it scratches discs very very easly and renders them unusable. This can happen because you moved the console, set it up vertically or for no apparent reason (I took every possible precation and I just ordered a THIRD oblivion cd)."
1,Great Planning Msft.,"I am going to complain about the same thing everyone has been complaining about since the day this launched. Why would Microsoft be so dumb as to attempt a global launch without sufficient stock. Honestly, when it comes to the Xbox, the US buys more consoles. Yet, they send tons to Japan and they are sitting in warehouses. I just want this system. My friend got lucky and scored one Christmas eve at Circut City, so I know the system rocks...hard. However, one quarter of the idiots buying these consoles are just selling them on ebay and ripping a huge profit. And I thought that scalping was frowned upon."
3,Could do better,"Microsoft Has just come out with a system that blows every thing else out of its way like a tank. Cool games, controlers fit better, and most of all graphics. Then Suddenly the news of a new console not the PS2 but the PS3 OMG! [could change name!] Anyways it come and smashes the 360 with bigger hard drive and its ugly body. 360 is a gonner any ways the morale of this story is that wait until everythings out before choosing somethign quickly, and being the coolest kid in school then turning into the uncool kid. I think the 360 could be better, PS3 could change its name and that I like marshmellows now let me get back to my Wii. :]"
5,Great fun!,"I love the 360, its alot of fun and is great to play with friends or over Live. My only complaint is from Amazon itself. My 360 came in a ripped box, so it looked like it had been thrown around. But the system works, just no nice box."
1,Unreliable. Console died in less than one year,"I am not a big game fan, and I got the XboX 360 mainly as a Media Extender.Just after I bought it, I regretted it, because of its poor capabilities a Media Extender, with no support for Xvid, DivX and even at that time H264.Furthermore, the IR Remote control did never actually worked properly, so had to use the Wireless Controller as a remote.What is worse, with a not too heavy use for games, my Xbox 360 got the 3 red lights in less than one year and died.For those considering to buy an Xbox 360, I advice them to google first for 'XboX 360 red lights' and they will get a clear indication of how unreliable this HW is."
1,Fun for 7 month until its death,"I bought this console at Amazon on March 2006. It cost me 1.300. I had to buy it with a bounch of games and stuff in order to have it. but it was fine, i was so eager to taste this Console.It was fine until it broke, with no reason. after 8 months of use.The same thing happend to my first Xbox (after 10 month of use) and my second Xbox (after two month)I guess there is somekind of problems with microsoft hardware. I am planning to change to Play Station, hopping to avoid this kind of problem."
5,best next gen system,"great system overall - much better deal than the ps3, at $400 its easily worth it. with great graphics in up to 1080i output, and the best lineup of games including gears of war (with 2 and 3 still to come) and the halo series. the controller has improved from the original xbox - a little smaller, addition of the triggger buttons., and the ability to turn the console on/off and open the disc tray from the controller, so u dont even have to touch the console. xbox live is easily the most advanced online community, with free downloadable demos for upcoming games, arcade games, and game extras. hands down the best next gen system out there."
2,SLOW GOING,"Her story is too much child hood so far, I haven't finished the book. I also do not like to have someone tell me how many words I can write!"
5,AWESOME !!!!!,"VALENCIA....GIRL,YOU DEFINITELY DID YOUR THANG ON THIS NOVEL. I HAD FAITH IN YOU WHEN YOU STARTED WRITING IT, I JUST HAD NO CLUE THAT IT WOULD BE THAT GOOD!! THE BOOK WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL BOOK READERS. IT IS ONE THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO PUT DOWN !!!! I HOPE THIS OPENS ALOT OF PEOPLES EYES OUT THERE WITH THE HIGH AIDS STATISTICS AMONG OUR PEOPLE. YOU DID A GREAT JOB AND I WISH YOU MANY MORE GREAT BOOKS AND MUCH SUCCESS, YOU DESERVE IT !!!!"
3,Good But,I bought this book and Hood Rich at the Truth Bookstore in Michigan because they were both Detroit Authors. I found this book to just be okay. I think it's a little over rated. Hood Rich on the other hand was excellent. I commend you for getting a positive hustle Valencia.Keep up the good work.
1,You call that black???,"I don't know what black means to Dataproducts. But this ink is no where near black. It's between a deep shade of navy blue and a dark grey color. FAR from the real solid black you get from the original HP cartridges. What's worst, the ink bleeds alot on regular paper, even the ones with minimal fibers. Like the other user said, get a pair of gloves, and ALOT of paper towels, and even more patience. It proves to me again that refill is never as reliable and good of quality as the OEM inks. Think of this, the photo or glossy inkjet paper you buy for a sheet... They are chemically treated to react well with certain OEM ink. Its chemical does not react optimally with some aftermarket bulk ink that isn't precisely formulated. I guess this is not too bad of an idea, if you just print alot of junk that quality isn't your priority."
5,A Thorough Study on Self Denial!,"I have read Shadow of the Cross at least five times. It is a wonderful read for Christians and would-be Christians. Mr. Chantry's survey of the call to self-denial is impeccable, thorough and challenging!It seems that in modernity, ""Christians"" practically never address the call to self-denial despite Christ saying twice in the New Testament, that if one is to follow Him, that one must deny himself! I am grateful for this wonderful work. To appreciate Shadow of the Cross is also to be willing to follow Christ - without excuses and without compromise!"
2,This disc is nothing special,"Ritual starts out strong with a pumping, grooving track -- spanish archer vs. tilt ""beautiful inside"". The rest of the set doesn't measure up. There's no continuity, no imagination, and the tracks themselves aren't strong. Overall, I was quite disappointed with this disc."
3,Ear Clip headset,The ear piece is too stiff....it hurts the ear after about 5 minutes of use....there is no adjustment available to make it more comfortable! What's up with that?
1,Does not fit on ear,The eearpiece is almost impossible to fit on ear an is very uncomfortable. Volume i s a BIG problem i do not recommend this
2,Disappointing - a missed opportunity,"The music sounds good, but I have only played it through a computer, so I can't speak to any marked improvements in sound quality. I'm sure there are Clapton audiophiles out there who have specific opinions about the quality of this new edition. Unfortunately, the packaging on this edition is a mess. All the pieces are loose in the box. The discs are placed in envelope openings with no bottom, so they slide down into the package and are almost impossible to extract without inflicting some damage. I will be very surprised if my discs are not damaged. What an embarrassment."
3,Stop the madness,"So this makes, what, the 40th repackaging of this album? Talk about squeezing every bit of juice out of the lemon.Surpirsed that there was no attempt at a new insert or new insights into the album. Same packaging, additional CD. Which unfortunately contains nothing noteworthy enough to merit the effort. Spector's two remixes are just dreadful, and if the other cuts were really going to go onto the next DATD album, I would have skipped that as well. Yet another version of Layla to go onto my shelf until it's time to resells it."
5,Clapton's best !,"This is by far Clapton's best. Duane Allman's slide guitar and contribution is unimaginable. The emotion can be felt in every song, through every guitar note, and with one great band of musicians. Clapton's love and lust for George Harrison's wife clearly provided this song writer/guitar player with all the necessary reasons to complete his finest release ever. Still stands the test of time and is one of my all time favorite cd's."
3,An interesting story if you have time,"I had the chance to read this book on a family vacation. We have tones of old books up at our cabin and I just happened to grab this one off the shelf, if I hadn't been on vacation I probably would have never read it. I have to admit that I enjoyed the story and character development. It's an odd story that takes place in Japan. It deals with the authenticity of Christ. If you have the time I recomend giving it a chance."
2,Sad,"After watching the newest Stepford Wives, we wanted to see the original. I'm still not sure, but I don't think that this is the original. The new one had pictures of the original at the beginning and this isn't it. This one was a real dissappointment after watching the newewst one. It moved very slowly. I'm still hunting for the original it looked more upbeat."
5,The Trouble With the Stepford Wife Prototype...,"....was that the ideal mate did not/does not exist and if you did body snatch and convert your mate to these soulless, catatonic androids who look like women....wouldn't 'that' also be chipped beef HELL on toast? I thought it would be a fun thing if a bunch of women here in town had started to run around in those full-eye/aminal-eye contact lens and those flower print chiffon dresses, talking about running home to cook a pot roast for their husbands. That would definitely cause quite a stir, here. Or, maybe not. Anyhoo, Ira Levin was one of my favorite authors--""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Boys from Brazil"" and the like--and this is a fine moovy adaptation of a chilling novel. A bit dated, but as I read in another reviewer's work below will be remade in the very near future."
4,"I agree with the ""sac-cali."" reviewer!","This was an awesome horror thriller for that time in movie making. However I do agree that it is very close to the Mormon cult's view of women. The only difference? They didn't have six children each to fill the ""wandering spirits"" mormons believe roam the earth in search of bodies to fill which good Mormon women provide them with by having babies. That aside, it was a great movie. Good special effects for that time period also!"
3,Great sci-fi story...poorly portayed,"interesting story line which was way ahead of its time. However,I had difficulty following where it was going and I felt that the ending could have been improved. Upon reflection; given the time period that this movie was made I did find it somewhat interesting.This was a early attempt to spring board the feminist movement. In that regard,I believe it was some what, ""sucessful""???"
3,Stepford Wives,"If you've seen the 2004 remake, you'd be best to catch a viewing of the original which keeps the atmosphere which the author intended.I enjoyed the original, but my main concerns are that it is dated, and boring. When it was released, it would have been very fitting as women were expected to be the ideal housewive. Nowadays such a theme is irrelevant and just seems a bit silly.Worth a rent if anything."
3,"Unbelievable, but spooky","First off: this isn't the most believable film I've ever seen. Do these women age? And if they don't, wouldn't their family notice? Would the Stepford Husbands allow their daughters to marry any man who was in on the secret? And what's with those flowing dresses? There are lots of inconsistencies. How boring would it be for any halfway intelligent man to live with a mindless robot (and I don't care how big her breasts are!) (Oh, I forgot about Hugh Hefner--but he doesn't count). That said: what a spooky movie--very suspenseful. And, yes, it's funny in a very campy way. I'd recommend seeing this film--it's no ""Blair Witch Project"", but definitely above average."
3,Cool Movie - bad transfer,"I just got the newly released (June 15, 2004) DVD and was surprised to see how low quality the image looks on a HDTV with a progressive scan player. You may want to rent this one before you buy it."
2,"4 Stars for movie, but zero stars for DVD! It's DEFECTED!","Beware of this product. this DVD is defected! I have a Home Theater system and at the loudest level, I couldn't really hear the speeches well. the soundtrack has been remasterd at very low peak volume and there is no captions or subtitles too. so if you want too watch this movie with family you probably miss so much of speeches and if you want to watch it alone, it can make you nervous! This is a great movie but with such a big problem in DVD, I suggest you don't buy it for your own good!at the other hand maybe if you use regular TV speakers instead of home theater system, the problem got fixed but what's the benefit for owning an special edition DVD and use it without a Home Theater system?"
5,GearWrench 7/16 inch,"This is the third one, just like the other two. I love GearWrench 9014 7/16 Inch, Combination ratcheting Wrench. I also have other sizes and all work fine."
3,Engaging but feels more like a screenplay,"This book is definitely entertaining and keeps moving nicely, but is fairly predictable and has some real plausibility issues. The technology curve is erratic at best and the dialogue seems to degenerate into shouting matches by turns. Not a bad work but don't expect a lot from it."
2,author needs to grow up,Readers younger then 15 will enjoy this book a lot. More mature readers are better off spending their time and money on something else.
4,Creating The Mood with Blue,"Being his third solo album, `Blue's Moods' further confirms Blue Mitchell as one of the major trumpeters of his era. While this album isn't particularly cutting edge and there isn't an absolute knock out track (my only reason for deducting a star), it does deliver with a series of strong overall compositions. Mitchell is often under rated, but on this album he has reason to be placed up there with the best. From the soulful standard of `When I fall in Love' through to the bluesy `Sir John' he demonstrates has versatile style and distinctive tone. Along the way he is ably supported by Wynton Kelly (piano), Sam Jones (bass) and Roy brooks (drums), who together produce a very satisfying and relaxed sound that is bound to become a favourite in your collection as it is in mine."
3,"Mediocre, like Lullabies","Like Lullabies to Paralyze, this is a frustratingly uneven effort. Unfortunately, I think Josh Homme is now too creatively spent to be able to write an album worth of interesting material in a 2-3 year time frame. There are several strong tracks (Misfit Love, Make it Wit'Chu, 3s & 7s, and Running Joke come to mind) but, as a whole, Era Vulagris leaves the lasting impression of having been a long, pointless drone with a lot of undistinguished musicianship and unmemorable riffs and hooks.If you're just getting into QOTSA, the awesome self titled debut is the best place to start. Songs for the Deaf is also excellent, although it probably took about 6 listens for its greatness to start to sink in for me, and the quality falls off after the first five tracks. Rated R is also an interesting and varied listen."
3,Need more time on this album,"I'm still debating this album, maybe because I'm too busy? not sure. I've given it the more than three time listen, for it to stick. so far some songs are actually memorable. Sick sick sick is okay for now. Into the hollow is cool. the strongest song on here is River in the Road. it is just amazing.Maybe I'll listen it again later and I'll love it then. This happened to me with Faith No Mores Album of the year. I wasn't thrilled with it at first then three years later became my whole soundtrack with exception to ""Might Surprise your self"". i may right something later on how I feel.What I don't like is ""Bulby"" and I miss Natasha Schneider"
2,really disappointing...,"I got so bored i didn't even make it past song 5... where's the melodies, the songs? Eh... maybe another listen but so far, i think i'll go back to the first album and lullabyes to remember why i liked them in the first place. Still a great live band, though.Update:This record sucks.2nd Update (3 months later)This record STILL sucks."
1,I can't believe this album has a 4 star rating...,"I guess that means that Rated R & Songs For the Deaf get 20 stars each and Lullabies gets 14. Bad production. Bad songs. Boring. Sure, I'll keep on trying to listen to it, but is that what you're supposed to do with a new album? Make it work. The other albums were bliss upon first listen. I don't care if it's complex. It's not fun. Actually, River In The Road is a cool song."
1,for die hards only,"queens hit their peak with rated r..just a fact.songs for the deaf was decent enough and rocked out.for the most part lullabies bored the shinola outta me, had a couple of decent tunes..meh...era vulgaris is weird, boring and does not rock.at this point, i only listen to their 1st 3..i gave the other 2 away."
4,Huh?,Not what I was expecting from the Queens but that's half the fun - it's never what you expect with them.
1,what happened?,Vol. 1 was terrific. Vol. 2 is a mess-- overproduced instead of acoustic... why bother?
2,Lost It!,"I have been a fan of SS for about 2 years now - I think that Barrel Ride and acoustic roots are both great CDS! I just got this new album - Dont know what happened? They pretty much lost all reggae/dub, and went a little more into christian alternative-ish / partrige family-ish...? alot of chorus, and looped beats! IMO they have changed there style almost completly, I hope that the next album will be a little more on track!"
4,Good Description of Charleston Architecture,"Frommer's Portable Charleston conveys the flavor of Charleston with its history and ""best of"" reviews. Also, the description of the gorgeous architecture of Charleston is very good."
3,"Leica's Best Compact Binoculars, But....","I know someone who had one for years and recently traded it for a Zeiss Victory compact 8 X 20 which he finds brighter and much easier to focus. It's a recommendation that I strongly second too, since I've own the same Zeiss Victory model for over a year. Regrettably, the Leica Trinovid 8 x 20 falls a distant second with respect to brightness and ease of use. It also doesn't seem to be nearly as sturdy as its Zeiss competitor (Note: I am a great fan of Leica optics, especially those for its M rangefinder system, which are among the best in the world. But unfortunately, the 8 x 20 Trinovid binocular can not be regarded as one of the firm's finest products.). However, if one wants a reasonably priced Leica binocular for outdoor concerts, sporting events, or hiking, then this is the one to get."
2,Not very rugged,"We purchased these binoculars to take along when weight forbade hauling our superb Leica full-sized binoculars, and were quite disappointed with them. Our biggest complaints:first, they are not waterproof, so they are not really good for humid, rainy, dusty environments, and you have to use caution when cleaning them. Second, despite Leica's reputation, they are very easy to warp out of alignment (we have always been very careful with our equipment, and cannot think when this might have happened). This is a pretty irreversible situation.Alternatives: I am very tempted by Swarovski or by a waterresistant brand which has a different tube-holding mechanism."
5,The best of the Dracula biographies,"Having acquired a passing interest with the ""real"" Dracula, it was nice to find a detailed historical account more in the vein of academics than popular culture. If you have a causal interest in Vlad then this book will be more than you want to handle. But if you are ready to deal with an in-depth consideration of the Impaler, you cannot do better than this volume."
1,Not helpful in the least!,"The majority of this book was spent answering the question of what perfectionsm is. If you actually want to buy this book, you *know* what a perfectionist is already: you!As to strategies for coping, only two pages in the entire book were helpful. The summary would be ""Go see a shrink: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and/or anti-depressants are both effective treatments."" I didn't really want to spend $12 for nothing more than be told to seek out a psychiatrist..."
2,There are better Sesame Street cds!,"There are better cds with better songs. The first three songs are good and entertaining for young children, the others are fairly boring."
4,If enjoy power chords...,"Where was I in the 90's when this came out? If it wasn't for Pandora, I never would have discovered The Gathering. How to describe this CD: If Meatloaf's band played for Grace Slick and was produced by Trans Siberian Orchestra, you might come close."
1,Totally unreliable,"I can't believe the ""experts"" review (above) praises the research in this bookNever have I seen more factual errors in a single place.Vistica can't even keep straight who was Secretary of the Navy when.Facts, dates, context, nuance are all screwed up."
3,Not going the MBA route (yet),"Book is a treasure trove of little-known operations and events during the '80s defense buildup. From secret wargames held 6 miles off the Russian Coast, to budget battles in the Pentagon, the book is an a keyhole to how the navy functioned in the Reagan Administration. Names of the key players that led the massive naval buildup parade across the book. Vistica's coverage of the 600-ship buildup was not complete but otherwise impressive."
4,Great Song Writing!,"I am here to say I am a believer in Phil Vassar's talent! I recently caught his video for the song, ""This is God"" on CMT. What a stirring song!This particular track is dripping with grace. It's all about how, in our humaness, we have twisted the truth of who God is and what he expects from us in our lives. I was blown away when I saw the video... and bought this album immediately!The title track, ""American Child"" is also a phenomenal piece of song writing. Phil Vassar isn't your traditional country artist. He is all country but more than that. He is a thoughtful writer with strong heart rending vocal ability.If you love heart-felt song writing and soul filled singing you will love this album."
3,good cd but not all the songs promised,I had gotten this cd expecting all the songs listed in the product details but the last 4 songs were not on the cd i recieved. My boyfriend was still happy about the gift but the point of me buying it was for those extra songs.
2,"Easy, Hard to Read","The puzzles are VERY easy and the print is very hard to read, especially in the killer sudokus."
3,Good for the price,This is an entry level pedometer. I little tricky to set up but there was good help with the on line phone-in helper. Very tight closure and very tight clamp. Probably just as well for an item one wears while moving. I had a minor repair and the unit was replaced quickly.
5,Chet Is the best,Wow! Is this guy number one or what? If you are interested in pure guitar genius then Chet is your man. I have even bought the guitar tab for this CD. This guy shows you that even with only one guitar you can make great music. His best album to Date! Definitely worth buying.Result
5,No Code is a definite Yes,"Such a cool CD. I was glad they had this in stock because it was discontinued and it did not disappoint! No Code is a different direction for Pearl Jam from the previous albums, more introspective and varied in music styles, I really really like all the songs but my favs - in no particular order are: Sometimes; Hail, Hail; Who You Are, In My Tree; Smile, Off He Goes; Red Mosquito; Lukin; I'm Open; Around the Bend. A definite recommend - get it while supplies last."
5,IT'S ANOTHER INSTANT CLASSIC LIKE ALWAYS!,"PEARL JAM IS THE GREATEST GROUP OF ALL TIME AND THIS PROVE ALOT OF IT,THE MUSIC.THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN MAKE THOURGH THE WEEK WITH NO HASSLE AND EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE ALRIGHT,CALL ME CRAZY BUT THERE'S NO LIFE FOR ME WITHOUT PEARL JAM,THATS HOW GOOD THIS AND ALL THEIR CDS ARE."
2,"Hey Pearl Jam, it's time for a break, or a kick in the nutz.","While flashes of ""Ten"" slendor are evident, the staple of the Seattle bands is loosening with each CD released. Just plain weird doesn't translate into just plain good. I give them props for doing something new, but bleching into a megaphone is new, too. And about as good. I know at least 50 bands better than Pearl Jam, Here's a list of a few of them: King's X, Faith No More, Living Colour, Lenny Kravitz, Sly and the Family Stone, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Korn, Nirvana, Soundgarden, James Brown, Alice in Chains, Metallica, the Dixie Chicks, the Spice Girls, My brother' marching band, my yellow rubber band, Yanni... Hey, Eddie..........what happened???"
2,The weakest one.....,"No Code is the weakest PJ album..........i remember the summer of 1996 very clearly....i was literally counting down the days till august 26th......when this allbum was released, words cannot express how dissapointed i was.........the album is soft, weak, it is just BLAND.....there are 13 tracks....but this album is pretty much over with after the 10th track.....I am a HUGE PJ fan...This album is for HARDCORE fans only!!!!"
5,A Spitual Journey,"I have heard many people knock this album. These people can not be true fans. This album send you on a journey. Every song inspiring a new emotion. Most of the time you don't know how you feel, but you know you feel it. Some feelings are obvious like ""Smile"" which, while listening, gives you contentment and ease throughout your body. This is a great album. It is as good as any they have made. Each Pearl Jam album, including this one, tend to stand alone as albums of great music for different reasons. If you love alternative music and want to chill out or have something playing in the background, this album is the one your looking for."
1,There's a reason why this album didn't do well!,"The first and only time I heard this album was in a Border's book store, when the album was first released. They had a listening station and ""No Code"" was one of the choices. I put the headphones on and expected to be musically satisfied! I was never more wrong! It's not like I didn't give the songs a chance. I listened to each track until I couldn't stand it anymore. As I advanced from one track to another, it only got worse. Then, I came to a conclusion. I would spend my money elsewhere and forget this album. The thought that kept popping up in my head was, ""I'm glad I heard it first before I bought it!"". As a Pearl Jam fan, this was a scary thing. I thought the band had taken a turn for the worst. Then came the album ""Yield"" and all was better!If you like the obscure, you might like this one. But, if you like music you can listen to, skip ""No Code"" and move on to their other albums."
1,Lets' face it -- No Code is better left undeciphered,"I love PJ, but here's the truth about ""No Code""... First the positives: The concept is facsinating and the packaging is the most impressive of any CD I've seen -- The fold-out case even comes with trading cards. The lyrics are perhaps their most engaging yet, including bits af poetry read aloud by EV. Problem is, No Code fails musically. There are two reasons for this; 1) It is a poor representation of the talent evident eveywhere else in the production, and; 2) It sounds nothing like the Pearl Jam we've come to know. The brilliance is gone -- The music is s l o w, dull and downright boring."
3,Love this with one 'dumb' reservation,"My 2-year-old daughter absolutely loves this CD. Everytime we get in the car, she says, ""Bert & Ernie"" and then sings along with the lyrics. I admit, I like it too.The reason I'm writing this review, though, is to let parents know that it has one part where the characters call Bert's game ""Dumb."" I'm sure my child will learn this word eventually, but I'd rather she didn't learn it from Bert & Ernie. I'm not sure what Sesame street people were thinking when writing this script. It's disappointing since the rest of the CD is so great."
4,The Office,"Item was received in good condition. It was forewarded as a gift and so was not viewed by myself. However, previous series were well received."
3,More Office...More Cutesy,"It's more of the same, but as with GET SMART, no one's willing to say, Enough!This season, romances are on again, off again, but Pam and Jim are happy and in love. A new manager forces Michael to establish his own paper company, and two of the staff join him in a converted bathroom office to wage a war with Dunder Mifflin, a war that goes surprisingly well. Still, in the end, it's just more of the same, but because we like the characters and the gags, we endure the frequent embarrassment in places.As usual, the best parts are Jim's relentless assaults on Dwight. Most of these take place in the prologues. This season is worth watching, but you can probably put off owning them until they drop in price. Or, you may be happy stopping at Season 4. It really doesn't get much different."
2,buyer be aware,Disc 4 from this season was totally scratched up. Quite a dissapointment really as most of the episodes on this disc were unwatchable.
5,Office-tastic!,"You've got to love the office and I think season 5 has to be one of the best ever! I highly recommend this DVD set. I felt a little ripped off with Season 4 as there weren't many episodes but Season 5 is choc-a-block! Oh, and the deleted scenes are fantastic and you should watch these to make it last longer. It's like another season again, so fantastic! I laughed my butt off!"
4,"The Office Season 5: ""The lesser of five seasons""","Alright, so I LOVE The Office (both BBC and American), however I found this season of the office to be the lacking. The characters that we know and love seem to make some drastic changes in personality - therefore changing the overall chemistry of the actors. I was a bit disappointed and it left me wondering if it has run too long...but that being said a 'bad' season of The Office is still ten times better than most sitcoms that are on today! It wasn't a complete wash Phylis is still hilarious!"
5,i love the office,not the best season but still really good and it has some of my favorite episodes :)
5,Shocking New Facts About Marijuana,"Smoking ""pot"" is fast becoming this generation's substitute for drinking alcohol. What started out as a relatively unknown drug used only by a select few in earlier decades, is now replacing tobacco cigarettes as the most popular habit of teenage Americans. Slowly but surely the use of marijuana will become so widespread that curbing its consumption will be nearly impossible. Unless action is taken now. Don Wilkerson, for years familiar with this growing problem, outlines steps for positive solutions that can be taken by concerned people. MARIJUANA is a special message for parents and teens alike in both guarding against and overcoming the temptation to use ""grass"" and it points out the ultimate cure for dependence on marijuana. This book will help you to realize that cure and be able to share its life-changing message with others.--- from book's back cover"
4,It Works!,Dr. Van Fleet's treatment for arthritis has proven effective for me. What first grabbed my attention was the fact that he wasn't trying to sell you some product that he sold. Everything he recommends taking can be bought at your grocery store or your health food store. The vitamins and supplements that you take are not expensive and I had relief from Rheumatoid Arthritis pain within 2 weeks. I've been following Dr. Van Fleet's protocol for 5 months and have very little pain or inflammation. My rheumatologist is very pleased. I would recommend everyone who has arthritis to try this for several months (Dr. Van Fleet recommends that you try this for as many months as you have had arthritis to see the maximum relief from pain.
1,"Poor quality, not worth it","These crayons were purchased for my son when he was 4, last winter. I only bought them because they are ""Buzz Lightyear"". It wasn't worth it. The crayons are very poor quality. They are worse than the poor quality of RoseArt products. The crayons are soft, almost 'mushy' to color with. I wouldn't buy this again, and feel the first time around was a waste of money. My son used them once or twice, then they ended up in the garbage, they were that bad. I'll pay a little more and stick to Crayola products."
2,"Oh, those poor illegal immigrants!","This is the kind of album we can count on from Springsteen when he's in a folksy, populist mood. But it just doesn't hit home, both in terms of Springsteen and folk populism in general. As a Progressive, I can appreciate his lyrics about injustice heaped on the downtrodden. But this music is sung and played without any conviction. The music is unmemorable. The synthesizer adds a welcome touch, though. When Springsteen moves to the plight of immigrants, he loses me. Those of us who have had our careers and workplaces ruined by legal and illegal immigrants can't work up any sympathy. To be a complete artist, Springsteen needs to produce albums like this and ""Nebraska."" But if the songs aren't tuneful and the performance is half-hearted, it won't do him or us any good."
3,Ghost of Tom Jpoad,"Believe it or not, I'm 61 and just getting into the Boss. I bought this CD because his live version of the title song is so great; it's a little different on the original here. And I'm not thrilled with the rest of the songs. Hey, you take a risk when you order CD's ""blind"" like this. Still love the guy."
5,Chronicle of America,"This is not the anthem-sounding Springsteen of Born in the USA. This album will probably not be used in any Presidential campaign. But it is one of the most disturbing, insightful and moving albums I have ever heard. There are no easy sing-alongs on this record, nor will you hear these songs as often as ""Born to Run"" or ""Dancing in the Dark"" on the radio. But each song on this album is a haunting chronicle of American experience. Springsteen's heroes in these songs are transients, immigrants, and the working-class. With these subjects, and the honor and beauty he gives them, Springsteen has truly inherited the Crown of the Invisible Republic that was once worn by Woodie Guthrie and Bob Dylan. Let this album bother you for a while."
1,Deserves One Star,"The purpose for buying this radio is the hand crank feature. For the one I bought, after the factory charge died, the hand crankdid not recharge. In addition I tried a charger, but it also failed to do the job. All that worked was batteries.This item is marketed under a number of names including Jensen, Innovage, and Lifelong. They're all the same radio except for the name. From other reviews I would gather that you can get a good one but that's an iffy situation.Oh well, I bought it just to play around with it anyway."
4,Exceptionally lovely!,It's not terribly difficult to understand why Mr. Schneidergets the characters and the setting remarkably right. I readthis book shortly after it came out and a few days prior tohearing him speak. He is an intelligent and caring souland this translates into his writing. I loved this bookbecause it has believable characters and it's the kindof story that makes me ache. But perhaps my favorite partis he gets the relationship between Inez and Sylvia(friendship/lover) just right. You don't have to bea lesbian to realize the nuances between these two women areperfect pitch. This is the kind of book I sometimes carryaround just because!
2,Some pretty words,"A promising premise, but in the end I didn't get it.The ending was just hollow for me. I loved the tale up to half-point & then it was... nothing. A hugely forgettable story.Not even sure why the story should even be written. Though it was written beautifully, yes. I heard from your publisher daily (why I picked up the galley from the get go).I SO wanted to adore this book. A man writing from a woman's perspective & approaching a lesbian relationship with tenderness; and it WAS tender. I give him that. But the end was a WTF?She has a successful career, talent, kids & a lover who adores her? Yet she bites it?Could be my life story without the men & kids."
5,Great watch,"I bought this watch about 3 years ago and it has worked really fine.I had to adjust the time and calendar once (on receiving) and I've never had to readjust it again.I've used the watch in the beach, rivers and gyms and the brazelet remains in excellent conditions; althought it has small scratches on the brazelet, the crystal remains intact.I really recommend it."
2,Not recommanded!,"I purchased this watch for my husband as a Christmas present. Since I had a bad experience with solar watches years ago (not Citizen) I decided to try it and make sure it works before I gave it to him. First thing I noticed once I opened it was, usually, all brand new watches have a very thin peace of cellophane on their screen but this one didn't have one. But it was a masculine and stylish watch.Our apartment doesn't have direct sunlight but it's quite bright! I put the watch in front of window for almost 4 hours and nothing happened! It did not get re-charged and therefore, I returned it."
2,Like watching a hero die...,"Since I got into the Dillinger Escape Plan I have tried to get hold of every bit of their stuff I can find. and when I finally got to hear this, I was excited that they were doing stuff with patton. Just let me say, that the music itself is mathematical, explosive and awesome as usual. BUT Mike Patton ruins this cd. I usually enjoy his work, but this a horrid match, in my mind only one man would fit with dillinger, and that is Dimitri their original vocalist. The only song I would actually recommend on this cd is ""Come to Daddy."" Otherwise, save your cash and buy Calculating Infinity or any other DEP cd just not this one. and as I said above, listening to this is like watching your hero get ... in the face, you just look at it a lil different. I am left with only one thought, ""Why, Dillinger, why?"""
3,Masterpiece....er....or not?,"First Impression -Truly amazing EP. I love it, as always great music provided by the Dillinger Escape Plan and also great vocals by Patton. It's quite a change. Where Patton's predecessor Minakakis did nothing but scream, Patton's vocals are more diverse. I do NOT want to call this an improvement, at least not immediately, since I liked Minakakis' voice very much and I never got bored of DEP. Still, I hope Patton and DEP continue to cooperate, since it IS a good combination....Okay, I've listen to this somed times again ...When I heard this EP first, I thought 'okay, his vocals are nice' but no more than nice and the worst the thing is: they don't fit with Dillinger's music! I read a review, stating Patton sounded kinda like Davis from Korn, well that's half true. The screams of Minakakis were much more in place! If you want a really good DEP record buy 'Calculating Infinity' or buy the best they ever made: 'Under the running board EP',..."
5,Just as I remember...,"I originally had the album, years ago..so I knew what I was getting. But absolutely love the whole thing..."
3,Learning Flash animation for beginner,"The Flash 8 projects for learning Animation and Interactivity book is a good resource for beginner to learn animation. It takes you step by step using practice examples to teach you basic animation techniques. The title of the book show two issues the first one is learning animation and I think the writer covered this part very well for beginners. The second issue is Learning Interactivity, which is covered along with the animation. The chapter that causes confusion for me is the 13th chapter. As it talks about e-learning in Flash, which is a very big issue that can not covered in one chapter, even for beginners. I think this part needs another book to cover deeply and give the beginner a strong beginning step in the field of e-learning.Regardless the 13th chapter I see the book focused well and this helps the beginners to grasp the idea of the animation in Flash."
4,promatic,"first off i would rather give this cd a rating of 31/2. sayin that the cd is good but not great. some of the tracks wear thin real quick but i gotta route for the home team who is an underdog. this is a fresh flavor that tastes alot like the d12 album. em should have made an apperence. overall though i would get this, theres enough on there to warrant a purchace. overall its some good mids but there's definately some seeds and stems."
1,"It is better ""El Ajedrez"" by Luis Ignacio Helguera.","El libro no representa de manera correcta una introducción al Ajedrez, deja muchos cabos sueltos y no profundiza en temas trascendentales para aquel que se inicia en el Ajedrez.Es preferible com introducción ""El Ajedrez"" de Luis Ignacio Helguera ISBN : 970-18-5320-2."
5,Hands down best CD to date from Tiesto,"All i have to say each time i listen to this cd it keeps on getting better and better. I just love this cd, not having to skip a track like most cds. I have to say i love Tiesto live in Amsterdam alot to, but damn what can i say but this CD is great. It's everything trance should be, superb vocals, great mixing, it's almost as if you were in dream that takes you into a sweet, melancholy journey. Everytime i listen to it, its puts me into a good mood and i just love this cd. That's why Tiesto is the number one DJ in the world. It'll be hard press for Tiesto to top this cd but lets hope he does."
3,Nice to see Tiesto still working,"Tiesto has stuck with his style and darker shades of trance. Some new sounds and new melodic progression is heard in this album making a few tracks very good while the rest of the album is just average. As long as Tiesto doesn't move into that male vocal trance stuff that ATB, Paul Van Dyke and Armin Van Buuren has gotten into, he should hold his own. This album is OK, doesn't really have any heavy hitters except for In Search of Sunrise and a couple other tracks that are very re-playable."
4,Perfect cd to relax or go to sleep to,"Although this isnt my favorite Tiesto cd,I enjoy putting it on mostly at night,when im about to go to sleep or after a stressfull day at work.It's got the perfect tempo,to soothe your mind and make you let go of all your worries.I usually enjoy more upbeat kinda stuff,but in this case Im totally satisfied with this more mellow trance music.This cd is guaranteed to take you to another place,and when it's done playing,your mind will be refreshed and you'll feel like a new person.Go out and get this ,in fact you dont have to be a dance fan to enjoy this beautiful album.Until the double disc In Search of Sunrise 4 is released on June,21st...Im totally satisfied with this."
1,Horrible.,"For a long time, I thought DJ Tiesto was nothing more than a rip-off. In an attempt to become more familiar with the ""worlds #1 DJ"" I bought his DVD ""Tiesto in Concert"" and was very impressed with it. Soon after I bought ""Nyana"" and enjoyed it as well. Yesterday I decided to pick ""In Search of Sunrise v3"" and I cannot stand it. The music is so lifeless and lacks so much energy. Yes, trance is meant to be soothing but not enough to make listening experience bland and boring. And that's exactly what this album is.After hearing Andain's ""Beautiful Things"" on Nyana, I was sure I'd at least like the album for ""Summer's Calling"". Wrong. Slow and uneventful like the album itself. The only song I really enjoyed was the ""Southern Sun"" remix by Tiesto himself but I had even heard that before so it was nothing new.Extremely disappointed in this CD and Tiesto. For being #1, he sure has problems with releasing good albums consistly.I would NOT recommend this CD."
1,Horrible picture resolution,"Has to be one of the worst cameras out there. First of all the resolution terrible. Don't even try the multi-view its useless. Night vision? What night vision! I had this on my Honda Odyssey with a Avic-z130bt pioneer deck. Even the cheaper baby monitor cameras are better than this one. Find one that has 420 tv lines, price really doesn't matter. Good luck."
1,If it were any more laid back - it would be dead,"Hey cmon you guys! You people have heaped so much praise on this turkey that I was expecting something special. Suck - come on, this aint even got the energy to suck. If I was to make out to this disk Id be asleep inside 4 minutes. Its obvoius that these guys can play and could do much much better. Perhaps one star is a bit harsh but I was expecting so much more.Every Sade disk has got at least one, sometimes two killer mid tempo funky grooves. It was this kind of *** that I was expecting on this disk. However, this disk is another triumph of style over substance. What you get is some halfway reasonable vocal tracks together with crappy instrumentals complete with 1 finger piano solos."
4,Accidental finds are often the best,"I was surfing around Rhapsody for a song called Sensations, and while I was looking for something completely different, I found Sweetback. I saved the tracks to my playlist and have really enjoyed what I've heard from this artist. I'm pretty curious about past and future releases from them.I guess I'm moving towards more ambient music that doesn't focus so much on vocals as I age and as my hearing gets worse. I've got about a 30% loss from various sources, and though I can hear sounds, I have a bit of trouble understanding words. I really like jazz and smooth jazz, but I also like some variety. I like artists and tracks that flow and that I can really get into and relax with. Sweetback seems to be one of those artists!"
3,Mom of 2 1/2 year old,This is so cute and my daughter loves it but it is overpriced. It is not sturdy and it wobbles. I am surprised the stool does not break when she sits on it. The voice sounds like a man. Cinderella appears when she supposed to and my daughter loves that and her happines is all that really matters.
2,Cute...with a few problems,"I was excited to get this for my daughter, but found that putting it together was a bit difficult. Some of the pieces were warped, but I did finally get it together. The only problem is that the stool was missing the cone shaped piece for stability. The vanity does seem a little wobbly too. I am a little disappointed, but hopefully my daughter will like it!I did email the company (CDI Toys) about the problems but have yet to hear back.My last complaint about this vanity was that the mirror is IMPOSSIBLE to get out once you put it in. I tried for half an hour and couldn't get it out.I would think about going for a wooden vanity that was more sturdy next time."
3,Just Passable,"Bought this for my daughter last Christmas. As I prepared to assemble it on Xmas Eve I noticed that all the screws were missing! So she did not get it for Xmas, but thank God her bday was only 4 weeks later. The company gladly sent me the screws about 2 weeks later. I assembled it, but it is poorly made. The plastic pieces do not line up well. My daughter still loves this toy and she adores all of the hair and beauty items. Once the key is installed sometimes you have to pres it hard for the voice to come on. Cinderella does not appear in the mirror anymore and it plastic foil mirror scratches VERY easily. She still loves playing with it regardless, but it could have ben made better for the price they charged for it. I am sure she will play with it for another year or so and then I will invest in a much nicer vanity for her."
2,Broken,Broken on Christmas. Arrived in original package surrounded by plastic blown up bags in a large card board box. Package looked okay. Broken Stool and Broken Vanity Drawer. Obviously not much care taken at warehouse for a plastic toy. My grand daughter was soooo very disappointed.
2,The novelty wears off quickly,"This was the one thing that my daughter really wanted from Santa for Christmas. Months later, it sits in the corner of her room and is used once or twice a month. It's not very stimulating and after a few minutes of play, she loses interest. It also tips very easily so we've had to prop it against a wall to keep it from falling over. The volume is also very loud but that's no longer an issue since I taped over the speaker. Cinderella appearing in the mirror is a nice touch, however, an adult needs to position and push the key in forcefully for her to appear. Quite difficult for a child to do. I wish I had saved my money on this one and purchased a nice wooden vanity instead."
2,Waste of money!,"To begin, we received the product [from etoys.com] damaged! Though assembly was easy and the toy was appealing to my children, it lacked a certain quality I have come to expect from Disney. The decals were darker than the table top, which looks cheap. What's more, the toy stopped working within several weeks of its assembly!It was a gift and too much time lapsed to send it back. I will try to contact the vendor, though.Please see my pictures on the product description page. Good luck!"
3,princess vanity,"Nice toy and the size is perfect, the assembly was easy and my doughter still loves it."
2,Really really small - disappointed to see in person,"I have a 2.5 year old and a 4 year old. They will tower over this thing. I went to Toys R Us to look at it in person and was shocked at how small it is. The concept is cute, but the size was super disappointing. Found something similar at Big Lots for $30 - not as many bells and whistles, but still a disney product, same style."
2,Mom of 3 girls,"My daughter received the vanity for her 4th birthday. I had already purchased the Step 2 vanity which I liked much better, but Daddy went and got her the one she wanted. It was the only thing she asked for. It is very flimsy and tips over very easily if placed on carpet. Within 5 minutes I noticed a large scratch on the mirror. I contacted Disney to find out about replacing that part but am waiting for a response. The light up feature in the mirror is pretty neat. My daughter likes it, but the quality is poor and I don't expect it to last too long."
4,stethoscope,This looks like it will work very well. So far I have not used it but will soon. My son used one just like it & was very pleased.
3,"useful tool, but unimpressive quality","I have used other Lisle products and have been generally impressed with the quality. The stethoscope is an exception. The earpieces on mine don't line up well, build quality is kind of cheap, and there are no instructions whatsoever. I called the company to ask a question about it, left a message, and never got a call back."
1,Lisle 52500 Mechanic's Stethoscope,I purchased the stethoscope to be able to monitor the sound of a clock beat. The scope does allow you to hear the clock beat but not very well.
2,"It's barely ok, Get the Scizzors instead.","Since I live in dungeness crab country I've been searching for the best crab shell cracker. This tool looked good but in practice hasn't really worked out. The thing will break open the larger leg pieces but it mashed the meat inside and it sprayed crab juice all over. While I expect some of this, it was worse than the regular nut crackers I usually use.Look instead for the Progressive International, the 7-inch seafood scissors. These are working out way better. You only need one pair of them to share around the table per 3 people."
1,Made me crabby,I bought this for my crab-lovin' hubby and was really disappointed. I wanted something that would save his hands from getting cut and crab-juiced and would neatly and quickly open those hard-to-open shells. This tool did none of the above very well. We used it to open big Alaskan King legs and it was messy and tough to use. Will be looking for the ultimate weapon elsewhere...
3,cheap and inexpensive for 18$ its okay,seems solid. but not as solid as the sirius mount i got off amazon. the holder doesnt hold the pda as sercurely as i want. i bought this because the real and powered pda i got off ebay has to come from canada. i need a holder now for the x-mas gift to be fully useful. akron can do alot better!!!
1,Stop messing about and give fans what they want!,"This show is in my top three all time favs list and I'd give my first born for S2 and S3 on DVD. But just S1 (which, let's face it, most fans bought soon as it was released some years back) and S2 and not even all the episodes in either? Sorry, I'm not parting with cash for that ripoff! PLEASE, give us a DVD release of S2/S3 complete and I'll bite your hand off for it. But not for this travesty."
1,What??,"How did Amazon think this was a smart move?? Hundreds of people await the release of season 2 and 3, yet they waste time putting this together! Give us season 2 and 3!!"
1,RELEASE SEASON 2 &3,I agree with everyone - I want season 2 and 3. Release them and be done with it - make the fans happy. We're the ones spending the money. What a load of crap - we all have season 1.
1,THE YOUNG RIDERS TV SERIES (24 HOUR MARATHON),"I, too, have been frustrated re the slow release of Season 2 and Season 3 of the Young Riders. But now I found an answer. Hulu.com is offering, for free (with some commercials inserted) Season 2 if you can see all the episodes on your computer. Meanwhile I await the release of Season 3 on DVD from Amazon which I will buy."
5,New Tools for the future,"I picked up this book on a ""gut instinct"" and I was right on the mark! This book that is channeled from Kryon through Lee Caroll is the BEST book I have read yet! Please also read the Indigo Children because they are the key to our new future! Any child born now up to the age of 14 will be showing us how to live! Letters From Home will easily become a Reference Bible for those who are lightworkers in this new age. I know I am a lightworker and I want to learn the new ""EMF Balancing Technique"" so that carrying my light will be reinforced and carried as high as it can be! This is the most exciting breakthrough for all of mankind! What makes it even neater is that we are all ""the angel within"", just as we always thought!"
5,Glee Season 1,"The product was shipped in a timely manner. Quality was perfect. Clean and fresh. Great show, can't wait for season two and three to come out on dvd!"
4,not available in your region,"I find it very annoying that people in the Caribbean can buy the kindle but the video feature is ""not available in our region "" will that ever be fixed????? SighKindle Fire, Full Color 7"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi"
4,"Too dramatic, but fun music",I watch glee every now and then when I'm in a particular mood. I like some of the cheesy pop covers and others I don't.
4,It's an amusing behind the scenes.,"If you like Glee and you've got the time, why not give it a watch?"
1,"5 stars show, 0 stars for the set",They need a Glee season one volume 2. I already own 13 of the episodes. Why would I pay another $42 to own them again? Insanity.
5,FANTASTIC,"What a truly amazing show, well written, funny, poignant and with an incredible cast of talented musicians and actors. Lea Michelle is unbelievably gifted and the rest of the cast is right there with her. WOW!"
4,Disappointed but not by content,I had never seen the first season of Glee. I enjoyed it for the most part...remembering not to take it too seriously. My disappointment is in the fact that one disk did not play correctly. Seems to be a chronic problem reading the reviews posted by others.
4,Laughs and cries,"I came to Glee late, I started watching reruns this summer, so I did not get the progression that was the first season of Glee. That was a very disjointed way to get the story.I got myself a weekend free and wallowed in the episodes. First I watched them all, then I went back for favorites. The extras are amazing, taken from the numbers in the shows and you can play them like a music DVD. When you find a Glee person, they each have their favorite episodes and characters. I loved the Madonna episode and the Lady Gaga songs were great. The show ending at regionals was masterful, you never know why they didn't win.The first year had some very interesting stories and character development. I am looking forward to year 2 and I hope they keep up the good work.I figured out that the reason I like the show so much is that the stories are funny, sad, silly and tuneful and I recognize all the music."
4,glee season 1,"Who doesn't love Glee? Well if you don't, you're a cotton-headed ninny-muggins. That's right I said it. Have a nice day!"
4,The First Season is Glee is Awesome!,"Though I only gave it 4 stars because I learned after purchasing it, most seasons of Glee are available free in streaming on Netflix! I may return this because of that, so if you have Netflix streaming--you may not have to buy this!"
3,"Great TV Show, Lack of Bonuses","Nice DVD set, and well ajusted menus but, as often, not many bonuses nor very interresting ones."
5,Glee First Season,This was a great DVD set. all of the disc's were great filled with lot's of extra's. I already have season 2 and look forward to season 3.
1,"Bad, bad packaging (DVD case)","The discs and show are wonderful. HOWEVER, the packaging is really terrible. The case arrived split down the spine, very difficult to close neatly. They sould be ashamed to package a product in this manner. I don't know where else to complain, so I'm doing it here. Sorry"
3,Very funny in theatres but not so funny at home,"I watched MTP twice in theatres in a week. I found it absolutely funny. Strangely when watch this on DVD, the experience is not the same. I guess watching it in crowded theatre with people laughing around you made the difference. The DVD is OK. Good picture quality. Both DTS and Dolby Digital are included but I can't tell the difference and this movie has no surround activities anyway so doesn't really matter which version you chose. Anyway if you saw this in theatre, try to rent this first to check whether you still like it. I don't like it that much watching at home."
5,Meet The Parents(VHS) better than part 2.,"Robert De Niro does not disappoint in this goofy comedy, And Ben Stiller doesn't either, I love the cat, it's a funny movie, ""It's just a Game Focker!""."
2,Meet the Boredom,"Again, I find myself at odds with society.Millions of people are enraptured with MEET THE PARENTS if for no other reason than Ben Stiller's surname being 'Focher' (you can just imagine the pronunciation jokes).Then, it's the THREE STOOGES meets FATHER OF THE BRIDE with some hilarious antics that predictably end up with the father and son-in-law sorting out their differences in a formulaic conclusion.The fabulous Ben Stiller and the legendary Robert De Niro are wasted here."
4,wow,"The The Casing of the DVD looked very used with stickers attached to this, and the DVD itself also looked very scratched. Definately not like new ( like the seller said it was).Unless having alot scratches is acceptable for some people, not me..But overal it did play without skipping.... on our Player at least, not sure if it would have played good on cheaper models of DVD Players.But movie is awesome ofcourse!!"
1,DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL,SOME HAVE SAID THE SECOND PART OF THIS FILM (MEET THE FOCKERS)IS A GREAT.I HAVE NOT TAKEN THE MOMENT TO SEE IT. I DIDNT APPRECIATE THIS MOVIE AND I DIDNT FIND IT FUNNY ONLY I FOUND IT INSULTING.
4,It's A Hoot,"I am one of those who is rather late getting around to watching this show. It is very funny and was worth the wait.It features Ben Stiller as Gaylord 'Greg' Fokker and Teri Polo as his fiancee, Pam Byrnes. Although they have been together for awhile, he has not met his future in laws. This movie centers around their trip to do just that.Robert DeNiro stars as father-in-law to be Jack Byrnes and Blythe Danner is Dina, his wife. Byrnes is a formidable character and a nightmare for any potential son-in-law. He thinks no one is good enough for his baby and Fokker is certainly no exception. The dynamics between these two are priceless. DeNiro really steals the show.This is full of laughs from start to finish. It is a good time."
1,If this is funny then i'm dead,"Because seeing a nice guy just get abused by a bunch of snobby, pretentious, holier than thou schmucks just ain't my cup of tea. All I could feel was sympathy for Stiller's character. Although I have to admit I laughed at the volleyball scene. So sue me."
2,"Just another ""ho hum"" comedy","Yeah, sure I laughed. So what? There's nothing particularly new or clever about this movie. Both Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro have had better roles in better movies. Plus, I found it excruciatingly painful to sit there and watch Ben Stiller do stupid and embarrassing things again and again and AGAIN.If you're in the mood for a movie you don't have to think about, and you like watching people humiliate themselves then by all means see it. But only a mindless idiot could give this film five stars."
3,fine,i came in the theature expecting a really funny movie. what i came out with was a semi-funny movie it seems like i heard all the jokes before...
2,"What a horrible, horrible waste","So, what happens when you take one of the best comic actors of his generation, and put him up against one of the most acclaimed dramatic actors of any generation?Well, when you've got a script as predictable as Meet The Parents', you get dissapointed.The film takes the greatest fear of any movie character (meeting a prospective spouse's parents) and works it by numbers. The few surprises (DeNiro's occupation, for one) are mostly under used. While there's a few really good & surprising gags, the majority of the film is wasted with predictable jokes."
2,Thumbs down,"I had heard this movie was funny, wonderful, etc but really, it is really a poor film. If you like Robert De Niro before, you won't like him in this as he is totally miscast. The humour in the film is average, and while there are some funny parts it is too over the top predictable crap. We turned it off in the last five minutes because it was just too far fetched. Granted, the movie started out ok and the storyline was promising, but within forty minutes it slowly died. Why does Hollywood keep making these crappy films. Moreover, why do big names like De Niro and Stiller do them - don't they read the scripts first?"
2,Stupid az heck,Whaz up with this stupid movuie? why is it so dumb? bad acting by robby. i can't beleiev it. how could hez maek a bad moviee? ben stiler is not a funny guy at all. iz dont likke his styukle is comedy. nothing good ibcould thinnk about thiz movie. and jay roach is one of the wortstd ircyteo today!
1,Stupidity meets Dumb and Dumber,"I like DeNiro very much, but not in this movie. The flick is so dumb that I couldn't watch it to the end. I don't think it's funny when someone steps into every imaginable an unimaginable trap on the way to get the father's yes. It was too much - rather too little - for me to handle that movie."
3,Too much.,"This flick had enough gags for two almost funny movies, killing a fairly funny premise and great cast."
1,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, it's not very good. Way over rated.","This movie is not funny, just dumb. Is saying ""focker"" over and over and over again really that funny? I'm sorry, folks, but NO, it's just not all that funny, and this is the same dull plot that we've seen over and over again in the movies and on tv. Not recommended."
4,BEN STILLER & ROBERT DE NERO ..... GUYS I LOVE YOU,"From the start of the movie i couldnt keep my mouth closed , the movie is really really really funny , Robert de nero still the master of all kinds of movie ,Ben stiller ... everytime i see his face i started to laugh .This is the type of the movie that you can watch it time after time & you`ll like it more everytime you watch it"
1,simply awful,"I understood that this movie was a satire, but the characters were all so paper-thin and fatally flawed that by the middle of the movie, I felt neither sympathy nor empathy for any of the characters. This movie was poorly written and I'm still searching for any non-masochistic explanation for why it was so popular. I would have given it 0 stars were that an option."
1,I almost turned it off...,"How many times do they expect us to laugh at DeNiro saying Focker? Who would accept such treatment from a potential father-in-law? What woman would let her father decide who she dates?I know this movie was supposed to be a comedy and not taken seriously, but I watched it with my entire family, and we didn't laugh once. DeNiro said Focker about 8 times too many. It's funny when you first learn what his name is, it's not so the next 7 times."
2,Watch this for a couple of OK gags,"I have read most of the reviews here and most of some merit. I DID watch this with a group of people and most of us were not laughing. There were a giggle now and then. Most of the movie is so badly written and the people in the movie are acting really dumb for supposedly being so smart. If you like smart people acting really dumb and at times snobby and obnoxious then this might be for you. I almost turned it off in the middle because I couldn't take how just unbelievable it was. I know it is a comedy and it can take some artistic license, but this was way over the top at times. I love 2 of the 3 vacation movies and basketball. So dumb comedys CAN be funny. You will get a few chuckles and maybe a ok laugh or two. The end the movie smartened up a bit but, that was so it could have a place to end. Overall I was disappointed. This is for the DVD which is why it gets the extra star for the extra features."
4,puff the magic dragon,"hilarious comedy featuring the works of the great DeNiro and the hilaroius Ben Stiller. The two work magically and bring this gem to life. Stiller meets the parents of his fiancee, Teri Polo(Mystery Date, Domestic Disturbance, etc., etc.) and then things get a little bit out of control. her parents being, DeNiro and Blythe Danner(Gwyneth Paltrow's mommy). you get funny ass moments including the part where Stiller explains to DeNiro that the song puff the magic dragon is about smoking pot and DeNiro thinks hes a pot head. other great actors star in this movie, Jon Abrahams(KIDS, Scary Movie), James Rebhorn(Independence Day1996) and Owen Wilson(I:Spy, The Minus Man, Bottle Rocket)."
4,"He&#65533;s winning me over, too.","I have never liked Ben Stiller. Hated Something about Mary. Loathed it. But I'm starting to crack - a smile.This movie was an eminently watchable, lighthearted flick you can see equally well with a friend, spouse, or your parents (that's provided your parents aren't sticks-in-the-mud, unlike Ben's future in-laws). Stiller's confused, sympathetic, Greg Focker is warm from the start, and Blythe Danner (as his future mom-in-law) wins the audience over immediately with her constant need for unity and calm, even if it is only appearances. De Niro's Jack Byrnes is a little stilted, a perfect foil for Stiller's over-the-top antics. But even Stiller has toned down his physical comedy. He is far less slapstick-y in this film than in the past, more reliant on the scene and slyer movements to set the mood, which is probably the reason I laughed so hard."
4,Let Loose People,"I saw this movie in one of the cheap theatres so it was some time after its release. When I left, I had mixed feelings about it but there were enough funny moments that (A) I felt my money was well spent and (B) I added it to my collection.When I look over other opinions, it makes me realize that sometimes we have to go into another part of our brain to find the humor in some movies. For example, American Pie, is not your ""classic, clean-cut"" comedy. But it's funny. I felt there was enough humor with spurts of seriousness to make it a good movie. The acting was good and to minimize DeNiro's ""credibilty"" as an actor because he did this film is saying this man can only play serious characters. DeNiro was funny and scary. Some of the lines were predictably dorky but that's simply what this movie is about.Because this movie uses a different type of humor I would suggest renting it before buying it."
1,Dumber than Dumb and Dumber,"Great actors cannot save this movie. It is the first time in very long time that I didn't finish watching a DVD. This is the exception. Every joke and presumbably funny situation is so predictable and over the top. Where's the fun? Sorry, my comment is: Stupid! (doesn't merrit one star)"
1,Sad,"Maybe my expectations for this movie were too high. I had heard that this was a hilarious movie filled with funny moments. What I saw a an almost unwatchable movie that is anything but funny.If you are reading this review then most likely you've seen the others and have a general sense of the plotline. I won't bore you with banal details. This is Ben Stiller trying to cash in on the same vein as There's Something About Mary (I really didn't think this was funny either). It is predictible slapstick which fails miserably to be funny. Too many stupid things occur in this film and it just becomes annoying.It is also sad to see De Niro in this role. You think of Goodfellas, Casino, and Taxi Driver and then this. He should know that after almost thirty years in film that comedies are not his strong-suit. I felt bad seeing him in this film.Owen Wilson is the only bright spot. His portrayal of the perfect ex-fiance is the only time I found myself laughing."
1,ordered twice and wrong one was sent,"bought it because it said it had spanish included, i got one without spanish language twice, thlis should be reviewed"
2,Silly,"This is a case of the scriptwriter asking himself, ""What stupid things can I get these characters to do & say & that's the only thing that is important."" There are apparently enough people who think stupid is funny to give this otherwise boring film a good rating. As for me, the film was just stupid to the point of embarrassment. I could only look at half of it before I got so disgusted with it I turned it off."
1,"Reallyawful De Niro ""Humor""","Listen readers, I am going to make this short. This movie has only about TWO good laughs. The humor isn't even ""sobadit'sgood"" humor similar to something like in NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. It is just plain bad. I have seen horror movies that have funnier comic relief than this provides for the running time! And if you think that is a turn off, it seems as long as THE STAND. You ever wondered why it says that there are ""39 used copies for sale?"" That is because everyone wants to get rid of it! De Niro and his agent must have been on PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON.On a good side, the acting is well and Owen Wilson is cool, even in this wasted role. Overall, too much attempted humor and not enough REAL humor.1 star out of 4"
5,gut buster,This movie is hillarious from the get go!! When you thought is couldn't get any more screwd up for Ben it gets worse. This movie by far is the most hillarious of 2000!! If you haven't seen this movie you have got to buy it. Even if its the only movie you buy this year!!
2,"One of the few chances to hear the late, great B.J. Wilson","Although I'm a big Joe Cocker fan, I find this live set severely lacking. However as big fan of Procol Harum, I'm thrilled to be able to hear one the great rock drummers play live."
4,Underground NYC House,"A pretty cool collection of underhound house tracks from late 90's, early 2000's. The first eight tracks are meant to be cranked up. The complilation ends weakly, but still a good CD."
4,Great music,"i have just bought ""Oh Holy Fools"" and think its great, maybe if i didnt have ""Lifted"" or ""Fevers"" i would have rated this 5 stars, nontheless ""SOn Ambulance"" was a surprise, with very solid songwriting, after the 2nd time listening to this cd i was hooked, both bands represent themselves well on this album and i would reccomend this to any bright eyes fans cause its definately worth buying"
2,"Good price, not so good expiration","Similar to other review:Pro: Free Shipping and Arrived Quickly.Con: Short Date on Battery; I ordered the Battery in November of 2012, the Battery expires in March of 2013.I used the battery for my dive computer and installed late November. The usage was turn on to test and then 2 dives first week in December. The next day I went to get my dive logs from the computer and received a low battery warning. My dive computer can be used for many months if the battery was...um...better.I gave two stars because without the battery I was not able to dive with my gear and/or computer so very disappointed in Hawaii. Just think if it WERE for a medical device...hmmm.The second reason for two stars is the image shows 2015 expiration but it was too late for me to make any changes ahead of my trip."
1,Poor,"I was first sent a badly damaged battery, The battery package itself was open inside the shipping package. I was then sent areplacement at no additional cost. The replacement battery was 9 years old! At this point I decided not to make any additional effort to obtain a decent battery. If these batteries were no longer available the supplier should have just conveyed this info and returned my purchase monet! I have been a long time satisfied customer of Amazon and this was the first item I ever received that had a problem."
3,Does this make me look Fat?,There are clear rules to understand the forms and how to optimize. a good investment for those who do not feel confident about choosing .. I wear?
3,Helpful . . . to a certain degree,"I found this book completely unhelpful, since I'm a teenager and the fashion tips Ms. Feldon gives are obviously for women over the age of at least forty. Maybe it's helpful for them, but teens, don't buy this one ;)"
4,Great beginner book!,"If you want to have a marine tank, this is a cheap and wonderful guide to help you out!It is a must for anyone interested in starting a saltwater tank. It is easy to read and is sectioned really well, which makes it a great reference after your tank is set up."
1,Not compatible with digital frame,"I purchased two of these cards. I tried both of the cards in a digitial decor picture frame and after the fourth picture it would have problems, I even reformatted the cards and still the same problem with both disks. I tried a different SD card before heading to the store to return the frame and there were no problems at all. The problem is the SanDisk cards -- hopefully I can find a product that can use the cards, otherwise there a waste."
1,SHIPPING CHARGES!,I PURCHASED FOUR MEMORY CARDS FROM THIS SUPPLIER. THEY CAHARGED APPROXIMATELY $5 PER CARD FOR SHIPPING AND WE ARE LOCATED IN THE SAME TOWN! SO I PAID 0NLY ABOUT $4/MEMORY CARD AND $5/CARD FOR SHIPPING. SENT AN E-MAIL TO THE VENDOR WHO BASICALY STOOD BY THEIR FEES. DON'T BUY FROM THEM UNLESS YOU LIKE GETTING RIPPED OFF! MOST VENDORS HAVE A FLAT RATE UP TO A CERTAIN PRICE; SOME EVEN OFFER FREE SHIPPING. BUYER BEWARE!
5,Great price,"It's great that with a card of this size you can take max resolution pictures without filling up your card and having to switch out to another memory card. I got three of these, one for each camera we have. Couldn't be happier."
4,SD Card,"Unfortunately, we never received this product although it was listed as being delivered, but I know that Sandisk products are high quality and would recommend them."
5,THANK YOU FOR DOING YOUR JOB SO WELL!,"I use this SD card in my NIKON D40 and can take hundreds of shots, even at their uncompressed levels, no problem. This card puts up with all kinds of abuse, and repeated dowloads through all kinds of readers (SD HC of course) with no trouble. REliable, clean, fast, easy; couldn't be better.I remember the horrors of film, and development by hand under harsh circumstances. It was truly an art and a science back then, but wow am I glad for this SD card. Takes the worry and care out of taking great pictures.No problem at a great price. DO you know how many boxes of film rolls it would take to get this many pictures?!Great at what it does, and does it well. Let us give thanks, and take pictures! Shoot a roll; keep a shot! Be happy!"
4,Make sure you can read it.,"Standard SD and SDHC cards look identical in size and shape, only SDHC-compatible products will be able to accept the new SDHC cards. SanDisk differentiates its new cards with the new SDHC logo on the card and retail package.Now my web research finds that at the time of its release Wes Brewer, vice president of consumer product marketing at SanDisk, said, ""In order to provide the easiest and most compatible solution for 4GB and larger capacity SDHC cards in the market, SanDisk chose to bundle its new MicroMate USB 2.0 SD/SDHC compatible card reader, which normally retails for $19.99, with this new card.""Note this deal does not include a reader.In my case the device I bought it for can read it. Without the dedicated reader my year old HP computer cannot ."
4,works like it should,What can I say? It works like it should. The transaction was uneventful and the product does what you would expect it to do.
1,Scammers,I refused order since I tried to cancel it due to shipping costs more than the item itself. The items are very small so there is no way shipping should have costs so much. I refused the order a month ago and still have yet to get the credit sent to my account..I am sure the product itself was fine but the whole deal is kinda shady if you ask me.......Lora
1,Does not fit.,Disc can not be used in my camera. This was not noted earlier. Money was wasted. seems to be wrong format for my camera/
5,Kindle Scan Disk,"This is an excellent way to organize books for the Kindle. I am able to put classics and fairy tales on one disk, theology books on another, spiritual growth books on a third, etc. This disk works well and the price is good, allowing me to download more books for my Kindle."
1,"they send me the wrong disk card, I asked for a memory card for an Olympus camera, I explained which one in writing the day I rl","I was send the wrong memory card, I explained which one I need it the day I returned the Item ,I wrote a letter explaining the memory card I need , they never Answered me, I paid for the wrong item mailed, Yet I returned and never hear from them again I was ripped off.I will never buy anything this way, the Item was returned via Us mail,to the address on the original envelope.one can not trust anyone."
3,Hmmmm,"No reader probably means no manual + box.Looks like a counterfeit, made in china. The colour is off compared to the 4gb product on sandisk website.2 very obvious scratches on the back.Works well on camera and Dell XPS laptop so far.Oh well...it's pretty damn cheap."
1,No reader is the key,"This is pretty much worthless. It doesn't have a ""reader"" and won't work in my computer (slide in slot). I suppose I could download from the camera with the cord and such, but that is so inconvenient it is worthless to me. I ended up just going to WalMart and buying a 2.0 gb normal one. I am not exactly sure why it was recommended with the Coolpix because it really didn't work well. Be sure to choose one with a reader so it works in your computer, photo frame, TV, printer, etc."
5,"works, cheap and fast delivery","Item arrived as advertised, faster than predicted by Amazon, very good price, and does what it suppose to! Neat! Definitely worth the money, you can spend a tit bit more buck for a larger storage SDHC."
1,pathetic,"disc was not sent after 50or so days, noreply from compoany direct so had to go thru amazon for help. pathetic company that should beavoided ,ack of response to issues unaceptable. i could not do lessthan a star, if i was able to they get negative star"
5,"TODD: TRUE GENIUS, TRUE STAR!",THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL TODD FANS. ENOUGH SAID. IT HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME; SO FAR AT LEAST!!
1,This book tells only bad stories about Albania,"The author realy seems to be proud of himself that he has survived Albania. I agree that not everything in Albania is perfect, but who wants to read stories about how lucky the author is that he wasn't killed and that since WWII no other foreigners has visited a place. Sometimes, you have the impression that the author really believes that he is one of the first foreigners to visit the country and not to travel back in a coffin. The book is another example of writings about Albania only mentioning the bad points because these things sell better. There are other critical books about the country much more worth to be read (e.g. Post's Women in Albania)."
1,absolutely false,"Dear friends. I'm an albanian guy and i lived there until a year ago and I know how it is. Some things that carver wrote are true, goverment mafia but what it's said about the people is totally untrue and very offensive against the albanian people. What about i tell the history of america by listing that two high school student killed 20 others and a guy killed and mutilate 6 people in a mc donald store.The problem is that a lot of people dont know about Albania and anything they read its interesting true and whatever.In albania maybe part of the goverment is corrupted (It happens in every post communist state) and a lot of corruption going on and maybe once in a while a group of people rise against the goverment armed (same as waco texas) and even the pay is only 100 $ for month, but a similar disgrace of the albanian people is ridiculos. (sorry for my english), So please don't beleive anything you read. Thanks With all respect Dritan Dilaveri tani@yahoo.com"
3,average,"typical dance/trance from the guys that seem to copy sasha & digweed's style. no need to rush to get this one, but it is a nice addition for your collection."
1,Got screwed!,I bought this thinking that I was getting a 12 pack of 9volt batteries. When I opened the box there was only ONE battery in there!This is deceiving. The product description even states pack of 12.I hope the problem is corrected and get my other 11 in the mail soon.
5,Excelent !,"Ok, this is a very funny Cd's, I'm a Professional Dj and people like ""California Dreamin'"" a lot, it's a very hard work for Dj Sammy, it's like ""Ian Van Dahl"" or ""Lasgo"" songs.I really enjoy this wonderful Cd, I hope you to buy this because is simple Amazing!. ;)"
1,complete garbage,its hard to believe that people would ignore the logical progression of electronic music and instead go BACKWARDS in time to remix old songs into this kind of rubbish that is a throwback to the arcane heydays of early 90's trance. being forced to listen to this stuff at the various clubs around midtown atlanta and realizing that their are grown adults that actually like this pooh has seriously damaged my view of the human race.
1,IT SUCKS PLAIN AND SIMPLE.(edited review on 10-28-03),"Now I know DJ Sammy can be creative with good dance music but man...this remake does no justice to the songs original version.His remixes of Boys of Summer was bad..bad..bad!! The video is bad the beat is bad, the singing is bad...man everything is bad about that song and the rest of the other songs on this album. It is a very sad album in terms of quality of music. I can't dance to this stuff man!!!!Basically DJ Sammy just mangled up the music to the point it was totally poor quality.I edited this review because I though he was an American Dance Music DJ. However, I was wrong. His music is still no good because I find it very surprising that being an European dance music DJ his mixes are that bad. He needs to get creative and stop making remixes of old 80's songs to the point that he desecrates them. And find another female vocalist to sing his remixes. That woman singing Boys of Summer really did some serious injustice to the song."
4,it was overall a good CD,"the first 4 songs were great but after that the quality quickly deterioratedthe female vocals on the first 4 songs were great, and if you are into female vocal trance/dance i would highly suggest you get the CD as there are a few later songs that are decent as well like: Paradise of Love and Vive el Presente"
4,a very well done album,"A very well done cd. I'll admit that i bought it b/c I hear Heaven on the radio and thought it sounded cool, but now i don't even listen to that track as so many other tracks are so well done, and I do like the little message of Vive EL Presente even if it is a bit hackneyed. Anyway i'm going to go buy sunlight now b/c i really like it's version on Heaven and the intro on DJ Sammy's website, and also Loona is exellent yet again. Everyone should check out their site .... Also I know it sounds crazy but I think DJ Sammy should pair up with Shakira and put out a cd."
3,Mediocre batteries,"The date on these batteries says 2012 but some were nearly dead right out of the box. Out of the 6 boxes of 4, I'd say some worked well (standard alkaline) and others died very quickly. I will not be buying these again. Amazon has other bargain alkalines for sale and I will give those a try."
5,So far so good,"I have only received the batteries for a few days and only tested a few of them. But so far, everything appears to be as described and the expiration year is 2017 (purchase made 2011). The batteries are individually boxed into groups of 4s within the big black box you see, but not shrink wrapped. The batteries say on them ""made in USA"", but I am not so certain since I have never seen this packaging of Duracell before (some reviews say this is the industrial packaging, but I don't have a clue). Either way, there are no leaks in the batteries so far, which is the only thing that troubles me when I buy cheap batteries. I will update my review if leaking ever happens, but so far, I am a satisfied customer!"
3,Awesome fun,Sounds great. This one is a four whistle.Who doesn't love the sound of trains going by.I like to have noise makers around the house for spontaneous fun.This fits the bill.
4,"Wise, Passionate Reading","Alan Crawford has pulled off a real coup here: he has not only done enough research for two or three doctoral dissertations, but he has turned the data into a very well-told tale, almost novelistic in its style yet free of fictionalizing. Moreover, beneath the fast-moving narrative, there is lots of food for reflection: the collapse of dynasties, the cultural drift toward civil war, the American tradition of starting over, something like a saga but without the pretentiousness the term implies. Comparisons with ""In the Garden of Good and Evil"" are inevitable, but I like ""Unwise Passions"" better."
3,wierd and wondering,"This book.... well the first part is boring as hell. greek mythology is a hell of a lot more inventive and intresting, and the heavenly realm itself, leaves one willing to spend etirnety in the underworld, happily.the gods seem very boring and not very imagitive, and thier political structure and stratagies, is enough to put one in a comma. However the section on Malfeas is absolutly stunning with its demented art work,exquisite practices, and political structures the book picks up there. that section alone is worth 5 stars, especially with the female lesser demons in saqdomasachistic leather garbing, might leave you on a journey to the nearest restroom, with a bottle of jurgens lotion and a box of tissue. i give the book an overall 3, because the first chapters really drag it through the mud. i say save your money for the next volume of the books of sorcery that delves into the gods and demons. they may have made changes to really step it up.any ways have fun and happy shoppen."
5,Every Architecture Student Should Own a Copy of This Book...,"I purchased this book about two years ago and it has been worth every penny and more. I often just leave it on my desk for quick reference regardless of what stage in a project I'm in. I am currently a third year Architecture student and can see myself using this text well into my practice as some of my professors admittedly do in theirs. The book is clearly laid out and is helpful in identifying various structural systems using a variety of materials and connections, foundation systems, detailed wall sections, etc. Great resource!"
1,Hated it!!,"Hart spends all his time trying to deconstruct the memory of Michael Collins. I couldn't stand it. For anyone looking for the ""real story,"" stick with Coogan or Mackay. But leave this trashy book alone. Collins never set out to be a hero. He was simply a man who made the best of some really difficult times in the only ways he could. I think it is unfair to hold him up with some of the other great men of the 20th century. The man was not a saint and that's a fact, but leave The Big Fella alone!!"
2,Misleading and biased,"Only read this book after reading several other on Collins and his role in the War of Independence. I feel that this author glosses over important aspects that show Collins genious and determination. Whatever his motivation for doing so may be, this biography is highly flawed in my opinion. Yes, some authors who write about the Big Fellow seem to get caught up in hero worship, but this author goes somewhat too much in the opposite direction."
3,Pleasant but not very substantial,"The strong point of this book is the believability of the main characters, as well as its lyrical language. I found the protagonist and his parents to be especially well drawn, and the conflict between the protagonist, a young boy, and his father to be credible. However, this book just didn't seem to go anywhere. I needed some significant plot, and it wasn't in evidence at all. I was hoping the boy would learn something growing up, but he didn't that I could tell."
3,An Entertaining Read...,"An interesting look at the social politics of the early 1920's. The novel is centered around the return of ""Jesus"" to the modern time, and his observations of greed, selfishness, lust, sorrow, and the ultimate division between rich and poor.The novel brings a whole new meaning to the 90's phrase ""WWJD?"""
4,Great Reference!,"I thought the book was very helpful and had a lot of useful information. In fact, I sat at home on a Friday night with my highlighter marking information I could put to use on Monday! The Quick-Reference Guide to Facts and Figures is my favorite part."
1,Very poor battery performance,I have ordered this battery for my watch and it did not last more than 4 months. I am really disappointed with this product.
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered Duracell batteries and paid for Duracell batteries, but received inferior no name batteries in the mail. I would hesitate to deal with this seller in the future."
1,I was gonna buy more but they keep raising the price.,I will soon buy some more once they lower the price back down to $1 a battery. but i have herd these batterys are great other than that. I just orderd two but will soon order more for my maglites.
1,Susceptible to tearing,"I bought this product a while ago and after using it consistently for a few weeks (3 or 4 days a week for 1.5 hours), the material within began to tear just beneath my bicep. The tear gradually increased as the weeks went on, to the point where the sleeve no longer performed as intended. I recently purchased aMueller Elbow Sleeve, Neoprene, Black, Mediumin X-Large (same size I had in the Valeo brand) and it is working well. The Mueller sleeve is more snug and the seams seem to have sufficient stitching to keep from coming loose. With both sleeves being offered at nearly the same price, I would elect to go with the Mueller brand."
2,Mediums are too small!,"I've had more pairs of neoprene elbow wraps than i can count over the years. All have been great up til now. I am an average-sized guy, but these mediums were way too tight to be comfortable."
3,Get the single CD instead=better remaster,"The other version of this available on Amazon, single CD is a newer remaster from 2000 instead of 1998. Even though this version includes a 2nd CD of live tracks, if you prefer the best studio recording you can get, I recommend the other one. That's not to say this one is bad though.Also, this version has talking on the live CD. While that's nice from a historical perspective, it does take you out of the music.Note this is a mono recording, not stereo."
2,No battery life,This GPS would be just fine if it weren't for the fact that the battery is always fully discharged. We have to plug it in to the cigarette lighter in order to find our way. This is TOTALLY unacceptable.Don't buy it.
4,Garmin A/C power cable,This is my own opinion: I bought this A/C cable to connect my Garmin to learn how to use the GPS without starting my computer. I found it handyNhuthuy
4,Garmin AC Charger,"I bought this Garmin AC charger for my Garmin 3790T GPS, since it only came with a car charger cable. It's an ideal alternative to charging it through your car. Great for charging in hotel or when car is not available. I only needed the plugs for USA and Italy, but it also comes with ones for other countries. The various plugs snap on/off easily. It's lightweight and small, but of decent quality. It will only fit into the GPS window mount, not the GPS itself, so you will need to have the mount attached to this GPS to use this charger. Not sure if true for other Garmin GPS models. That's the only reason for a 4 of 5 stars."
4,Satisfied with purchase,"I would have liked the option of purchaing just the AC cable for less money, but I was happy that I found this on AMAZON for less than the asking price on the Garmin website. Works fine for my Garmin Nuvi 255WT. My GPS came with a charger for the car, but I wanted the option of charging indoors as well."
3,Garmin AC Charger,I feel it should have come with the Garmin. The new ones do not have anything but a USB cord.It works fine
3,Adapters don't work for anything else.,Was surprised to find that the international adapters can't be used with anything else. I was so intent on finding something that would charge my Garmin when the car charger wouldn't fit in the cigarette lighter (as happened in Italy) that I didn't look at the pictures or read the reviews.
1,ANOTHER BAD CHOICE,"Amazon offers this as an accessory for the Garmin Approach G5. This is a recharger. the G-5 is battery powered, not a rechargeable. Why is Amazon offering a product that cannot be used with the product for which it is recommended? is this Amazon's choice or the retailer's choice? Whoever's choice it is, it certainly makes them look like either they do not know what they are talking about or they are trying to defraud the unwary buyer. if you bought the G5 or G3, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,ac wall charger,i couldn't use this on my nuvi 760 gps as it had a different connection. it was advertized as fitting the nuvi's but it doesn't so i can't give a opinion on it. i sent it back and got credit. shirlee larotonda
3,Great Cd - not advertized correctly,"The album review mentions this as the last concert featuring the original line up. The fact that I saw them in 1981 makes this statement untrue. However if they may mean that this is the last live recording officially releasted by them, than this is true. Regardless of the meaning a really good 'live' show!"
3,GI Joe Sailor,"While taking off utilities to put on dress blues - arm broke off. Not happy with what I had to pay for this set. I spent a lot of money for it to be a ""funny"" for my youngest son who is entering the Navy. (Got a GI Sailor in 2001 for eldest who also joined the Navy). Now I must find a doll repair place and probably pay another pretty penny to get it fixed."
1,Quality of DVD is poor!,"I love Cagney and Lacey and was glad to see the show come out on DVD. The episodes on Season 2 are less than the other seasons for some reason. Also, those of us who bought Season 2 have distorted pictures and cannot view. I hope those of us that have found the DVD defective will get another replacement copy free of charge!"
2,Disappointed with this DVD,I was disappointed with this item. The description says its the complete second season but in only contained 8 shows.
5,KIDS WILL LOVE THIS,KIDS AND ADULTS WILL WANT THIS BOOK...I WISHED I HAD GOTTEN THE FIRST EDITION BUT IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD IT IS A LOVELY EDITION TO A BEGINNERS OR PROFESSIONAL COLLECTORS LIBRARY......REALLY WELL DONE AND FUN!!!!!!
4,Cool book.........,"This one of the many pop-up books Robert has out right now. I'd get Alice in Wonderland and/or The Wizard of Oz for your bookshelf. These are really great books to own. The Night Before Christmas is just not as ""cool"" as the other two books I mentioned above."
5,?,no clue did not order this size battery dont have anything that uses them and they are sitting on shelf unopened but amazon did take care of the matter
1,Don't get these,"I got these for my game cameras because they were suposed to work longer and in colder conditions. I have put them in all my cameras this year and have had no luck. They only work a few days, and it has only been cold a couple of days this season. The dates on all of the packages were good. Last year I used Energizer and they lasted me all season, I was just hoping to get two seasons out of these. Very bad product!!!!"
5,Best Alkaline batteries I've found,"I use the procells all the time at work and for my business. This set was actually used for LED Christmas candles in windows and they lasted for well over a month, lighting up for 12+ hours each night. These batteries always seem to be stable and reliable."
3,Upgrade blackmail,It is a great program. What I resent is the marketing tactic that require upgrade every three years whether you want to or not. If you do not upgrade by their dead line then upgrades are not available and one must pay full price later. That is just BS.
1,bad news for Manson fans.,i was horrified at how uninteresting this album was. the single HSG is the only song on the album that i've listened to all the way through.i'm sure this is a great album for anyone who has never heard a Manson album before.
4,The real Manson,"WOW He's done a great job with this one. This album is the most dark/sad album he's made. I think it describes what's going on with the guy. There's no strong / fast / heavy songs as in Antichrist Superstar or even on Holywood but musically it 's a very good album. I've been listening to it a lot.My favorite song at the time is ""They said Hell's not hot"" but the whole album makes you feel like listening it again."
5,Growing as an artist yet still the M.Manson his fans love....,"The new album Eat Me, Drink Me is more of a striped down Marilyn Manson then his fans listened to in the past. Songs like Heart-Shaped Glasses, Just a Car Crash Away to name a few are more raw then Manson showed his fans with past albums. In the long run will Manson fans like this album? Well I am a huge fan of his and this album is a work of art. It has meaning and substance and the songs sound more true then every before. So if you are a M.Manson fan don't think twice go get this album it is something that will eat at your heart and help you see the world of love in a new light that only Marilyn Manson could create. 5 stars!!!"
1,Fram Filter Does Not Fit Toyota Camry!!,"Checked both the Fram filter catalog and Amazon before ordering the Fram FT1181 transmission filter kit for my 2005 4 cylinder Camry. Dropped the pan, removed the Toyota original equipment filter and tried to install the Fram filter. It does not fit. One of the bolt holes is about 2 inches from where it needs to be. Went to the Toyota dealer and bought a Toyota filter. Can't return the Fram filter to Amazon because the package is open. I don't know how you would determine whether it fits without removing it from the plastic bag."
4,"A Beautiful Story of Struggle, But Lacking Something","A Leaf in the Bitter Wind was a book I read for my Non-Western Culture class in college (I'm an English major). This powerful story about one woman's struggle for her family's freedom from a politically obsessed society is a touching one. Of course, there also seems to be some element missing, probably due to the fact that Ah Si (the name she's more fondly known as) tells the book from her childhood perspective during most of the novel. She creates a brilliant portrayal of the struggle she must endure during these days in Communist China. And after all that, I must say I found the end a little disappointing. Overall, I would recommend this book - especially to those who are not aquainted with the true story of the situation that occurred in Communist China during Mao Ze-Dong's reign."
1,Not satisfied,The batteries were opened. The battery box looked as if it may have been wet. The batteries were sprawled all over the amazon box. Were the batteries used?
5,Procell Batteries,I use ProCell batteries for all my smoke alarms. These alarms are wired into 120VAC and use the battery for backup. I change every 2 years and find that even after 2 years there is very little voltage drop. I would definitely use again.
1,NOT FOR SMOKE DETECTORS!,"I suppose I should have given more credence to the previous reviews.After only a couple weeks, I'm seeing the red flashing light on my smoke detectors indicating the battery is weak. I'm just waiting for the beeps before I change them out. Will probably get that in the middle of the night, right?I'm sure these batteries would be just fine in a toy for a 2 year old, but I would strongly recommend looking at other sources of 9-volts for any application that depends on a reliable battery. There is a reason these are sold in bulk and are low in price."
2,Not Worth Buying,"We used these 9V Procells in multimeters. I was told they didn't last long at all (compared to copper tops). I tried some in a digital camera, but the result was less than impressive. I contacted the company; they gave no explanation, but was nice enough to send three coupon, for up to 8 cells each, as a way of saying, I guess, they were sorry."
3,3 and a half stars would be closer,"I am the biggest Journey fan in the world, but this album was just ok for me. There are a couple of great songs. ONE MORE is a really cool rocker, and EASY TO FALL is a fantastic ballad. I could (and have) listened to that song 20 times over. This is really a mature sounding album for the band, with more personal reflection and insight. I would agree that this album has a 'stormy day' feel.The musicianship is top notch, and not a dissapointment, but this album is no 'Escape'. Not really any bad songs, and I do like this album better than 'Arrival'."
4,Journey makes a good return.,"Trial by Fire is a good return for Journey. I've never thought that any of their albums were awesome, but solid would be a better definition. They return with another solid peice of work that continues to find it's way into my player years after it was purchased. I'd definitely recommend it to Journey fans of the past."
5,Not Disappointed :),"Another great CD by Journey. Steve Perry will always be the face of Journey to me. Alot of great songs on""Trial By Fire"". Steve Perry's voice just seems to get better. An excellent come back album, just too bad the reunion was cut short. You have the popular ""When You Love a Woman"" and also, in my opinion, some over looked gems. When you listen to ""When I Think of You"" you can't help but think of that loved dear one that was taken and you will have at least one tear by the end of the song. ""If He Should Break Your Heart"", ""Forever in Blue"", ""Easy to Fall"", and the title track ""Trial by Fire"" where definitely over looked on this last performance by Steve Perry with Journey. All tracks are a keeper :D"
4,Brings Back Memories,"My late grandmother kept this book at her breakfast table for as long as I can remember. There is an entry for each day of the year, and that was her inspirational reading every single morning. She even took a paperback copy of the book with her when she traveled. She told me the area he describes on his farm reminded her so much of the central Connecticut 150-year-old farm she grew up on in the 1910s and 1920s. I read a passage from this book at her memorial service, which she had quoted at the death of her husband many years ago. I'm buying it today, so I can own a copy of it for my breakfast table."
2,"At best, a difficult read.",Best read in one sitting as the visual images are just not there. A difficult read at the best of times.
3,Blowing Smoke,"I had serious trouble getting into this book. While it is well written in terms of use of language, it's also very disjointed, split into chapters rotating somewhat irregularly between the mother, daughter, and son. Wilson, the son, is a very interesting character and finally I read all his chapters ... starting from the end of the book and working backward. There is no coherent plot and while there's tension between the characters, I haven't yet gotten fond enough of Wilson to care. Nor will I.I'm still giving this book three stars instead of two because I suspect a different sort of person than me (one who favors family relationships and bizarrely interesting people over tight plotting and narrative flow) might very well enjoy Secondhand Smoke."
3,The Title Should Be Clarified,"This was a good book, with many good ideas for a school that wants to look at becoming an all-inclusive school. However, it was less about modifying school work (as the title would lead you to think), and more about becoming an all inclusive school. I feel the title should read: ""How to start the path to becoming an all-inclusive school."" There were also some good ideas on modifying schoolwork, but I would have liked more of that."
1,What is this crap?,"This anime was very violent and bizarre. I had trouble understanding the plot, if there was one. I was confused with the excessive amount of violence in the fight scenes, how exactly did the bad guy jam his fingers into other characters chests and then cause them to erupt in massive volcanic-like fissures of blood? Maybe it's me, but I like a little realism in my anime.The dialog was written so that a three year old could follow it, but unfortunately the film is much too violent for a three year old to view, so I guess the film's writers need to sharpen their writing skills.I don't understand how films like this one can make it into the ""cult classics"" genre. If you view the film without bloodlust on your mind, you will be impressed at how stupid the story actually is. Do people really write this stuff!Save your money, if your looking for violence rent a live action adult oriented film instead of this drivel."
4,"Delightful album, Very Upbeat but with a sinister side",Beautiful Cello music coupled with witty lyrics and blackly comic narratives. It is hard to fit this album in too any categories as it transcends many. worthy addition to any collection. How We Quit the Forest is far better though.
4,"""Crush a Hummingbird in your hand just to feel it.""","This CD is absolutely amazing. Ive listened to Rasputina for a few years now and they have yet to disappoint me. The mellow yet edgy cello sounds that flow from this cd are great for anything from studing to sex. My personal favorite tracks are 'Rusty the skatemaker', Dig ophelia, Why Don't You Do Right?, and Transylvania Concubine. Sheer art."
5,Wicked,I just listened to my friends copy and i am going to order it right away she has a completely energizing mix in this CD.
1,I want to like it but . . .,". . . it feels so greasy, like I have a layer of baby oil on me. Some people like baby oil, but I want to be able to touch my clothes and bedsheets without worry. My friend gave this last Christmas and I wanted to like it because it has a great reputation. Now, it just sits in my medicine cabinet waiting for me to toss it out. For hand repair, I recommendUpper Canada Soap And Candle Naturally Whipped Hand Repair, Sweet Vanilla Fig, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)."
3,A Really Great How-To-Video For Your Business,"Ok, so you won't lose 30 pounds or stop smoking with this How-To-Video; but let me tell you that your business, whether it is a small family owned business, a growing medium-sized business, or a large service business will absolutely gain valueable insight regarding government contracts.The three presenters in this video are the ""real deal"", they really know what they are talking about as they do this proposal writing as a successful career for their clients.There is also a companion workbook / textbook that can also be purchased through Amazon.com.Highly recommended, I'm going after federal government contracts beginning this week. Thanks to the guys from Government Contract Services; and good luck to you all out there."
2,booty music,This cd is ok. My boo is a great song that is why I got this.It was the smash hit of 96. Brings back memories of my freshman highschool year. The rest of the cd get irritating after awhile. It sounds so outdated now.I must admit that this was the best ATL had to offer at the time.By the way baby d and lil jon make the prefame cameos in this. Save your money for vol.2 which is a way better than this.
2,"Phat Beats, but still a disappointment","I bought this CD because I love all the SoSoDef music thatis on the radio. I was disappointed. The only good song on there is My Boo by The Ghost Town DJs (which is the main reason I bought it.) Pretty much the rest of it is mostly rap with the same beat. If you want to hear some good SoSoDef music, then don't get this one. Get Vol II."
5,Acrobat 6,This product was as advertised. The software loaded as designed and worked well. I am happy with the purchase and was able to complete my project.
4,Fine Travel Guide to the Two Cities,This is a very useful guide to planning a trip to these two cities and finding your way around when you are there.
5,This is an excellent book. I couldn't put it down.,"This is an excellent book! If you are a beginner and just starting out like I am, this is the book for you. The topics are excellent. They are written in easy to read and understand words and terms. This book covers all the topics including what to look for in your first telescope. The charts are wonderful and easy to read. The pictures are awesome. In addition, Terence provides a list of stars and constellations along with their pronunciation and meaning. Terence shows and explains how to use major constellations to find other constellations and stars. I found that I couldn't put the book down. This book will hook you on backyard astronomy."
5,I love it.,"Industrial metal/space pop band Zeromancer that sounds verry simulur to Orgy only a little harder and lot more cussing. Songs like ""Wannabe"", ""Chromeb**ch"", and especially ""Dr. Online"" are all excelent original songs by this band. The cover of the eightees classic...Real Life's ""Send me an angel"" is also pretty damm cool. I like this album, if you like this kind of music you will to."
2,FLASH,"Jeff Beck's Flash In my opinion, was not one of his better albums.""Gets us all in the end"" is a hard driving rocker.""People Get Ready"" with Rod Stewart on vocals is a Classic!Take these 2 tracks out of there, and this was a new sound experimentgone south! Too much of that New Wave sound which was becoming increasinglypopular in the 80's. Just not my cup of tea.But if that sound is you Go for it! Jeff Beck is still one of the All timebest Guitarist's that ever played an ax."
3,Welcome to the 80's,"Not that this is anywhere near a pop album, but his guitar work wasn't really in the forefront of this record (which isn't too bad of a thing since he had some pretty good singers on the record). Only a couple of decent solos... did have more soul & funk attached to it. Yeah, I'm being unfair in my comparison, but I thought he was trying to bring MTV to him vice bringing his music to MTV... & what does he do?? .... lead w/People Get Ready w/Rod Stewart who was already in bed w/MTV. Carmine Appice does some nice work on this record."
2,THE WORST THING BECK'S BEEN INVOLVED IN,"This LP is a must only for completists and hardcore fans, especially those that want to hear Beck sing again (he's on two tracks).Beck's solo work is excellent-- even the addition of Jimmy Hall's histrionic vocals can't diminish the sheer audacity and skill of one of the best guitarists in the world. Hall's not a bad singer-- he's amazing-- yet it seems his vocal style was of its period. Up against Rod Stewart, there's no comparison. The track 'People Get Ready' is phenomenal, and should've been a bigger hit.Check out the second track to get an idea of what Beck might've sounded like firing up an Eighties Hair Metal band (via Mike Oldfield). While the song itself is rubbish, there's something to be gained from hearing it.The rest is dross, and suffers particularly because it's bracketed by two of Beck's best albums, 'There And Back' and 'Guitar Shop'.Oh, and while it's been re-released, it hasn't been remastered."
3,"Strong vocals,drab songs","Tina Arena-who I watched on Young Talent Time-as I was growing up(the same way americans once watched Brit and Christina on the Mickey Mouse Club)is a great singer,but also boring.I dont like this CD anymore.All the songs are really boring especially the super-hit Chains."
5,Awesome video!!!,The best training video on the market. Murray breaks everything down to where it is so easy. Simply the best one going.
1,poor quality,"purchased this bag for my husband to use for his adult soccer league which meets once weekly. After using it for one season, the pockets ripped, leaving the bag useable, but all one compartment. disappointed in the quality of this bag. opt for a different Adidas bag."
2,Not what I ordered.....,"Ordered this item and anticipated its arrival. I have a small collection of sake sets and I am very picky which ones I like. This particular one I thought was unique, however, when I got the set it was of a standard sake bottle and ordinary cups. They were colored but the design was defiantly not what I wanted. The picture is also showing what I got not what I ordered and at the time the picture was of what I ordered. Rated two stars because of the chance of it being a computer error and the ease of return."
1,Kindle Edition Review,This review is only of the Kindle edition not the book. There are too many typos and editing problems in the Kindle version. Stick with a hard copy.
5,Handy!,This little beauty is a nice tool to have on hand. It is the only thing my mother wanted for Christmas after losing hers. I would gladly buy this product again!
3,Not sure yet,"I would like to play the game, however when it arrived (Christmas present), the batteries were dead. These being button type batteries, we had none on hand.. overall disappointing as we were planning on playing for Christmas. As soon as I am able to get out and get some of these annoying type batteries so we can actually play i may write another review. Just wondering why batteries are dead in the first place if they are included with the product?"
3,MUCH smaller than I expected,"Cute game, but it is much smaller than I expected it to be- not much bigger than a set of Uno cards. Haven't played it yet so can't review how fun it is or whether the kids liked it. Just wish it had been a little bigger."
2,A story with good characters but writing little originality,"I almost finished this book. I would have, except that, as much as I had initially been drawn in by what seemed like strong story and character development, I just lost interest. After a while, (and the first two <b><i>Pulp Fiction</i></b> quotes i.e.,""We're associates of you're business partner. You do remember your business partner?""), I began to realize that these characters weren't original(one of the main characters seems loosely based on Christoper Walken's character in <i><b>The King of New York</i></b>, the prose did <b>not</b> match the period (he's got people in the 50's talking as if it's the 90's. i.e., ""Like, um, what are you going to do?""). And a pet peeve of mine, British writers who want to write American novels but then slip in stupid British sayings like, ""It'll work a treat!""Whatever. I really tried to be fair, but this book bites and it was disappointing even though I didn't have high expectations."
1,Do not buy this!,This product is a piece of junk. The only education my 9 year old daughter got was an education in frustration. It makes a horrible mess and the end product was nothing but a wet lump of clay. I strongly encourage anyone who is thinking of buying this to think again. Do not waste your money and time.
5,Great Fun for the whole family,"My son is 3.5 and loves playmobil (construction) and spotted this movie in Target. I wasnt sure what to expect but this movie is fantastic. He's already watched it 3 times, sings along with the songs and just loves it. Its great for the whole family. There's a lot of singing and dancing, very similar to a musical and has great morals throughout the story. Very well done, i hope they make more movies for the other themes.."
5,A Blast From the Past,"The Babysitter's Club books are so great! I loved reading them as a child and it was fun to read one again (now on Kindle) and be transported to Stonybrook with the BSC. If I remember correctly, this is Ann M. Martin's favorite book in the series - and with good reason! This book marks such a great turning point for Kristy and showed such a fun project for the girls, which was caring for a bunch of kids so their parents could get ready for Kristy's mom's wedding. Cute fun book and I'm so glad these are coming out on Kindle so I can share them easily with the kids in my life!"
3,Rosh Hashanah gift for mothers,"I bought this book as a gift for my mother and my boyfriend's mother. From the cover, I thought it would be full of pictures of delicious Jewish food. Besides recipes, I think a good cookbook should have mouth-watering pictures. When I flipped through this book at my mother's house, I didn't find a single picture! I was so disappointed. My mother seemed to like the recipes and tried some to varying degrees of success. Overall, the cookbook seemed very well researched and organized, but I wish there were pictures."
2,"better than freebirth, but far from what we deserve","Falcon Rising -does- do better than the previous attempt to entertain. not saying much, htough, since Freebirth (I felt) was a waste of my five dollars. However, neither book belongs in the twilight of the Clans story, and while this is at least semi-entertianing, it certainly shouldn't cap the TotC saga."
2,clan based stories don't always make good reading,I have enjoyed the series but the Clan culture is so far removed from our own it makes it difficult to like them or to sympathize with the Characters I think it is best to leave them as enemies and not try and make a story out of an entire clannish setting. The book does well act as a information source about the current state of affairs in Clan Space but I still can't say I like the characters
3,Schizo,"A beautiful young ice-skater is stalked by her mother's killer in the weeks following her wedding, but no one seems to believe her despite the number of bodies that begin piling up around her. Who is this crazed madman, and what does he want with Samantha all these years later? Pete Walker fashions another mean little Slasher film out of England while taking key notes from the popular Italian Gialli. Although it is well-played and stylishly directed, the slow pacing, cluttered plot, and predictable twists make this a pretty standard watch. Even still, the bloody payoff in the end comes as a complete shock. Walker slips in several other brutal murder sequences throughout the film while somehow managing to keep it off of the notorious ""Video Nasties"" list in the UK. With enough atmosphere, killing, and suspense to keep the average viewer's attention, SCHIZO proves to be another enjoyable entry in the early English Slasher cycle.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,You Get What You Pay For,I bought this thinking that I would save money. It worked great for 1 month. Then it just died. Now I must buy a new CD player. I would have been better off buying a higher quality player in the first place.
2,unhappy,"I can never get it to work after it has been sitting for a few days all it does is come up error. I like the wireless part but if it doesn't work then is not much good, maybe this was just a defective one I hope."
4,GREAT ALBUM,This is a really great album. I like all of Mike's albums but I think this is one of his best.
2,no their best cd,sorry to say but this cd isnt their best one self titled unwritten law is way better get that one instead oz factor really is not that good black cd from UL is by far my favorite cd of all times
2,Pottery Wheel,I bought this pottery wheel for my grandson who had expressed an interest in this area. We have been disappointed in this product as it is difficult to use and not as described. The pottery wheel is small and for a 9 year old it is just not what we thought it was for him. I really can not recommend this product.
3,it's okay,"its higher than $10.But it's not bendable. No problem with Skypebut, i bought this for Rosetta stone.it doesn't really get my voice well.When i used internal microphone, it worked better than this.if you talk to right in front of this mic, it will work very well"
5,Too short,I for one am very thankful for the revival of my favorite type of music thrash. And municipal waste are one of the band's carrying the flag. At first i was tempted to write them off as a gimmick band with a bad name. But im glad i didn't because the art of partying happens to be one of the best cd this year so far and is a glorious reminder of why i like thrash so much in the first place. They have perfected the crossover thrash sound. The riffs rip and are gauranteed to give you a very sore neck. The lyrics are funny in places its nice to see a thrash band with tongue in cheek and serious in others. The vocals fit the music perfectly. My only complaint is the cd is just to short.
5,Amazing,I first came across mozart kugel as an exchange student living in Germany. My host family said that these are great candies but you have to buy them in Austria because the others don't compare.
5,slayergirl2001,"This is a must for Sailor Venus fans!!!! This book even taught me something new about Sailor Venus and I thought I knew everything there was to know about her(and then some rumored stuff). It's even a great reminder of the stuff that you do know about her. Take the challenge, you might learn something new, and that goes for the other scouts too. Sailor moon sez!"
5,Venus is the Absolute BEST!,Overall this book was an EXCELLENT read.It had TONS of information about Minako and was well made although I don't think that the price suits the size of the book.I think that Venus' Senshi Guide is the best one of all the fanbooks. I especially liked the section that had Mina posing with Usagi.
4,"Suggested for Otaku, Artists, and Website Owners","At only 93 pages, this book may seem a little expensive [...]. However, i believe the Scout Guides were intended for otaku (anime fanatics), and devoted fans of the show. This book has lots of pictures, so it's great for us artists. For you website owners, it has lots of character statistics, as well as episode information. If you're looking for insight into Sailor Venus as a person, this is a nifty book, which reminds you why you love her. It even has translations of the Japanese songs, which adds alot of depth.The big thing to watch out for, however, is that you get confused by the layout. In the episode summaries, the events may seem to occur out of order, maybe even backwords. Fans who know how to read Japanese manga (right-to-left) will have an easier time with this book."
5,Loved It,I am relativly new to spinning. I heard about this book in a magazine and started looking for it. When I found it I imediatly bought it. I am greatly enjoying this book. I find that it can be dry and technical but that it can also be funny and entertaining. Mr. Amos does not hide his opinions or apologize for them. I do not agree with all his opinions but I find the honesty refreshing. I hope you get this book and enjoy it as much as I have.
5,Far Side Still Rocks!,"I read The Far Side cartoon in the newspaper years ago and loved the series. I got the whole set of books for my 12 year old son who gained an appreciation after I gave him a Far Side birthday card. We read from them every day, they still crack me up. Wish Gary was still making current cartoons today. Still hilarious after all these years."
1,Tedious at very best,"Buff's initial foray into fiction lacks. Her characters exist in a pollyanna world, desparately seeking development or at least an adjective.For someone who reads two books per week for most of my adult life, this one has dragged on for nearly a month. I don't recommend it. This is a boring book."
2,No...,"In Germany the TV Channel RTL2 has created a Show, where you can watch the casting of a girlgroup from the very first moments on, and the Group is called ""No Angels"". Their Management has baught the Song ""Daylight"" and they now have their 1st Number 1 Song in Germany, Austria & Switzerland. I think it sounds much better than the New Life Crisis-Version, because the female voices fit better to the song and the production sounds far better. You'd better check out this one."
4,Trucks,"I enjoy scarey movies, not gorey, but the movie keeps you involved.The movie has a good storey line, great actors.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old classic movies."
2,iIt was ho-hum.....,"If you are like me,and watched Maximum Overdrive when it came out, then this is NOT FOR YOU! It's really crappy and somehow,the continuity isn't the same as in the aforementioned movie. Keep looking....let this one go."
1,tight! and didn't hold up well,"black band at top was super tight, and within 1 hour of wear the socks got a run in them from the top down. Had to throw away after wearing once. But they were for a halloween costume so it wasn't a big deal"
1,Bad customer service,"Bad customer service, the equipment arrived damage and still I am waiting for the solution"
1,worste Kit ever!,"If you are a medical student, and you actually care about seeing what you are supposed to see using these tools, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!! (or any of the other kits of similar make or brand.) You might as well buy a childs toy kit and use it, becasue the quality of these tools is so inferior that any hope of seeing an optic disk, or a tympanic membrane is lost.(after struggling unsuccessfully with the P.O.S. I purchased, I used a fellow student's higher quality equipment and found the optic disk instantly. That said, if you could care less, and just need something to get you through the course- this set looks real fancy, and is the option for you. But if you actually want to use these tools inside or outside of your profession, aviod this brand, cough out a few more bucks, and get someting that is actually well made, and workable."
1,Not useful as a student,"For a physician assistant student, this otoscope/ophthalmoscope was not very useful in examining the eyes and ears. I could not visualize the optic disc or the tympanic membrane and so I returned it. I tried to save money by purchasing a cheaper one on amazon, but you get what you pay for and it was apparent in quality. I purchased the Welch Allyn instead which is more expensive, but I feel is necessary to visualize the landmarks in the eyes and the ear, especially for a student that needs to learn how to use the right equipment and actually see the structures."
5,ENT Kit,"Great value for the money, has frunctionality for manual removal of cerumen impaction that more expensive otoscopes have dropped. It is great for basic evaluations!"
4,Good Read,"Like many others have found this book difficult to read straight through. And after I got close to halfway through I almost gave up. But after taking a short break, I picked up again and finished it. I found the writing to be interesting and different. And that when I finished the book I was glad that I gave it a second chance. All in all, this was a very interesting and captivating read."
2,good looks poor reliability,The stereo looks great on the wall. The illuminating colors are amazing. Everybody got impressed with it. But right now the CDs are not working. The only thing I can hear is the radio. And now the illuminating lights are having trouble. It has only 3 months of warranty. but it didn't last a year. I like the looks but its not reliable. They replaced it with a new one but its no wall mountable. I don't recommend it
3,Canine behavior encyclopedia,"A highly technical, behaviorist slanted, wordy A-Z book of behaviors. A dull read which necessitates extraction for application in dog training. Not exactly what I thought it would be - but none the less a good reference book."
2,Content,The content of this book I found a little thin. Did not really get into the subtlties of dog communications
3,Dog Language,"I bought this for my 16 year old daughter, the wording and language were a little difficult for her, but she did finish reading the book."
4,This CD lets you know you'll be fine & life continues.,"If You need to feel relieve a little stress, just sit and chill to this CD. From ""Can't let Go"" to ""Been A Long Time,"" Laurnea relaxes your mind with her smooth voice and lets you know that everything will be okay. Through heart ache and pain to tears of joy, you'll hear every aspect of life. Buy it!!!"
1,This review goes to the movie,"This movie, is probably the third worst movie we saw on February of 2001, the movie tries to exactly do the same things that the Rugrats movie did, but it fails, for exapmple, in the animation, the jokes try to be funny, but they aren't they are used,they are exactly the same jokes we see on the cartoon, and altough they are new ones, none of them work, also it's a bit stupid, but the soundtrack is great, especially for the Martha and the Vandella's song."
3,It's common sense !,"Whoever working in software will see that Yourdon wrote abunch of guidelines for common sense !I've made some walkthroughs at work (I am softwareengineer) and I've seen that I've found most of theproblems described in the book, even if I work fornot MIS industries.I think that book can help in the future: I have to admitthat it is useful"
2,You need an African sense of humour!,"I purchased this DVD, my first Nollywood one, as it was highly rated. The cover describes it as a ""first-rate comedy"", but there was precious little comedy in evidence! Nkem Owah may be well-known (I don't have sufficient experience of Nollywood to say) but Mara Derwent gives a rather wooden performance, and the British cast definetly do not rate the accolade ""a brilliant British cast""!I was disappointed, but may buy another Nollywood movie before reaching any conclusion about this genre."
5,What a FUN book!,My 3 yr old and 5 yr old boys love this book. Not only is it chosen for story time but it keeps my 3 yr. old very content while I'm driving my other 3 children to their various destinations all week. I highly recommend this book.
5,A great entertainer in the car while traveling!,My 2 and 5 year old made a trip with friends to the beach and they brought along this book. We loved it and wanted one for ourselves. The rolly eyes are very funny to watch. The words were challenging for me to read and fun to listen to when someone else read it.
3,Ok board book with fun jiggly eyes to keep kids entertained,"This board book has a ten little indian theme (each page is a count down to none). Each number/page has a different type of dinosaur -names given- and a funny rhyme. The eyes are 3D balls encased in plastic so they jiggle when you move the book; there are holes cut in each page so the eyes are visible throughout the book. This book could be for young kids, but also older ones heavily interested in dinosaurs because the different types depicted and named (an older child could be learn the names and be prompted to talk about their characteristics).I only give this an ""ok"" because the some parents might not appreciate the rhymes that have the dinos doing bad things (like racing a car on skateboards) or name calling (a police officer calls them nut-brains). Also, almost every page has the dinos drinking from a glass coke bottle, which seemed a little strange."
2,Too complicated for small kids,"We have ""Ten Little Puppies"" and love it, so I thought this would be just as good. It uses the full length scientific name of each of 10 dinosaurs. The adults reading it (all with college degrees) have to stop and sound out the names, and the kids get bored and leave. It lacks the rhyme and rhythm of ""Ten Little Puppies"", and falls flat. Too ""cute"" to be a big kids' book; too difficult to be a little kids' book.So disappointing!"
5,A Dino-mite counting book!,"This is a cute book that will interest your child in counting. The rhyme, which is along the lines of Ten Little Monkeys bouncing on the bed, is accompanied by rolling eyeballs of a cute dinosaur. If your child loves dinosaurs and you want to introduce counting to them--they'll love this book."
2,Regional coverage? I don't think so.,"Except for a routine or two, all routines shown are for the Arkansas ladies team. The item description should note this so someone (like me) would know this DVD does not cover the teams who reached the regionals!"
2,"Old, outdated, no kinetic data","I purchased this book with the expectations that it would contain kinetic data such as frequency factor, activation energy, and rate constants. It does not. Rather, it's a just a textbook that explains what each of the above parameters are.Well, I know that cumbustion has a fast rate constant, and I'm pretty sure I'll test it on this old stinky book."
4,"if you like infinity, read it","Imagine searching for notions and uses of infinity in a wide range of intellectual disciplines and then weaving them together into a pretty fabric that can be understood by a sufficiently intelligent layman but does not read like a typical watered-down popularization of science and math. That is this book. If you enjoy the concept of infinity, you will greatly enjoy this book."
3,The Stolen Bride,I love Brenda Joyce's deWarrene series but this was my least favorite one. I did enjoy it but it was my least favorite of this series.
1,Very poor story and unlikeable charaters,"The story was very thin, Eleanor was a spoiled brat, and Sean was wishy washy at best. I actually liked Peter Sinclair the best. I think he got a lucky break 'not' ending up with Eleanor in the end! This book is not worth the time to read it or the money to buy it or the window to throw it out of! But if you are a Brenda Joyce fan and an unbeliever and you must read it, I would suggest the library."
2,Stepsiblings in love.....ICK!,"1 1/2 StarsI made it through about 400 pages before I realized it wasn't going to get any better. I got that far because it was a Brenda Joyce and I love her older work; clearly not the caliber it once was. There was nothing appealing about stepsiblings that were raised together having sex. It was unnatural and disturbing.Apart from that (if one can actually get past the incestuous under(?)tones), the heroine was tstl. The story took forever to get moving. By page 200, the bride had yet to be `stolen'.In the 400 pages I plodded through the heroine told the hero she 'loved him so much` at least a hundred times, they'd had sex, he stomps off in horror about it, she throws herself at his feet, 'cups his cheek` about 300 more times, he loves her, he loves her not..... All the while running from the British cavalry hot on his trail set to hang him for murder!Phew! Not a keeper for me. For a steller BJ read, try ""The Conqueror"" or ""Dark Fires"" instead."
1,"Sensationalist, trivial and re-hashed from better books ....","I've seen ""Mr. Shaw"" speak at s conference; I cannot describe adequately how much I held this presentation in disdain. Maybe this talk was valuable to someone who had just awaken from a 20 year coma, or in all seriousness, to the executive who doesn't have a computer on his desk and depends on a secretary to print out e-mail, because it was sensationalistic and contrived. To me, much of his material seemed completely repurposed from Evan Schwartz' work and full of lots examples why we should all ""look out, or you'll be disintermediated"". I'm sure this guy is off somewhere toiling on his latest book, which no doubt will get ""5 star reviews"" from his friends and associates, but save your money and consider Amor, Swartz, Robert Plant for insight."
5,Excellent tool for ecommerce beginners,"For those of us who know nothing about ecommerce but know we need to learn, this is just the book to read first. It's in plain english - no technical jargon."
1,Old ideas and messages,"Mr. Shaw's book misses the mark on the issues facing companies with E-Commerce. His book lacks the depth and incite that either a novice or experienced e-commerce reader needs. Mr. Shaw addresses E-Commerce from an EDI perspective and does not provide the vision that companies need to address the technical and process issues surrounding e-commerce. He uses examples of companies that have been disected effectively by most e-commerce books and periodicals 2 years ago. He provides no additional value to these examples. The book is overpriced, lacks content - don't waste your money or time!"
5,Good overview of what e-commerce is all about.,"I bought several copies of this book for my salespeople to give our customers. Most of our customers are not very up to date on e-commerce. Several of them have called me to say the book gave them a good, quick lesson on what it was all about. Not too technical and very interesting."
2,A three player...,Played it three times and forgot about it. Not her best work. She is so much more talented than this.
4,Practical and Inspiring Information,A terrific anthology of writings about Morocco--some contemporary and some historical. Excellent practical information for travelers. My only criticism is that it should be updated as this edition is 2001.
3,Excelente cantante del folclore Argentino y latinoamericano,Se me hace imposible conseguir los CDs de la Sole aca en Puerto Rico o en EEUU. Soy fan desde el 96 y me encanta su musica. '
3,Loses Air,"My son is 22 and a paraplegic. This is the only pillow I have found that I can use with him on his guerny table. However, the pillow tends to lose air. The first couple of pillows I bought lasted awhile, but then the following ones did not last long before going flat. They also take a long time to dry. Overall, this pillow works for my son's needs as long as it keeps air."
4,Fun toy,Great toy for a four year old boy. Durable and fun. Lots of very small parts - watch out for younger siblings.
2,Was ill prepared for what I got...,"I loved the story of Heinrich Schleiman and how he found the remains of Troy, including a treasure trove of jewelry that he discovered among the ruins, so when I saw this book I was all excited to see a nice assembly of pictures of the booty he uncovered.I was not prepared for a more text book presentation that this book provides. Had I known that I would likely have passed on it, looking more for the visuals of the goldsmith's artistry in the jewerly that was recovered.However, it is very rare that I will ever return a book because knowledge is never a waste to acquire and there may come a time when I might need to get information that only this book contains and I'll have it.That makes this book an unexpected gem that I will keep in my library until I need to tap into it."
1,Very cheap cases...and I don't mean only the price,The price on the cases is cheap but you get what you pay for. I will never buy these cases again. Quite a few of them were broke when I got them. Even the ones that weren't broke are made of VERY flimsy plastic and I have a feeling they will break if I open them very often. They also don't open and shut very easy. Look elsewhere for good cases.
3,Warped cases,Overall not bad for the price. However about 10 percent of them were warped. They were still useable but a few had to be thrown out.
1,cheap cost and assembly,The cases are are a good price but almost half arrived broken. Not such a good buy when so many end up in the garbage.
3,100 Pk slim jewel cases,"This is what I ordered and what I wanted. However, only the top was clear and the :""base"" was black and not transparent."
1,BAD SHIPPING!!!,"They shipped these things in a large box with inadequate packing material!! About 1/3 of them were busted on arrival! I needed them too bad to mess with a claim, but this shipping was ridiculous!"
5,Great Product,"This is the third time I have order these disk cases and I am happy to say I'm not disappointed. The pack comes fully intact, meaning NO broken parts or cracked cases. The cases are sturdy and a good buy for the price."
1,Chips Jettison!,"Whatever happened to the good ol' days and ""Soft Batch"" cookies...sigh. Of course, I do believe that if someone asked me to go back to '84 in order to scarf a ""SB"" cookie, I would probably retch and declare that any straight-from-the-box cookie trying to emulate a chewy, warm, fresh-from-the-oven cookie should be left to disgrace the next generation...which it has. Enter: ""Chewy Chips Ahoy!"" (come on, what's with the exclamation point?). This whole freshly-baked-tastin'-cookie-from-a-box deal just does not work, folks. I will admit that the chips were luscious, but I can get that from a chocolate bar anyhow. So sweet that it hurts, and so chemically touched that they should be classified as cheap cosmetics. Leave them to the eight-year-olds, before the truth dawns on them.Footnote: Please see my review on ""Mrs. Field's"" (chewy, soft, something like that) oatmeal cookies with raisins and walnuts for more ouch."
3,Nothing that special,"It does the job.Each spread has the bear on one page with a shape, and on the opposite page four items that happen to be that shape.Just what you expect."
4,Nice knife...,"The knife is quite nice and the rubber grip makes it easier to handle than some other brands. Unfortunately, this item is not as advertised: Instead of arriving with the 5 different blades clearly pictured in the description, it came with 5 identical blades (the triangular blade installed on the knife in the picture)."
3,eh.,"a lot of people have been saying how ""hardboiled"" mickey spillane is.i suppose that's fair to say.a lot of people have been saying that he's trash.that too is accurate.spillane is hard to describe. he can make a good plot outline and occasionally some decent diolauge, but most of the time it kind of just walks from one point to another, and predictably, too. the whole thing is like an inept chandler homage, but spillane deserves credit because the book at least can evoke memories of chandler. i guess it's good for a look, but really it's just kind of a book one would buy at an airport, read, then throw away."
1,not at all waterproof,"The first time I wore these, I stepped into a puddle and my socks got absolutely soaked. Through these boots."

3,Definition Of RAW - - - ROUGH ! ! !,"As a rule I like all things ""CHICAGO"", and I wouldn't say this is bad, it just has so much room for improvement. The ""hosts"" are basically unknowns, their lack of charisma detracts from and slows the show. They have to remember, the theme and basis for this DVD is ""sit in on a band rehersal"", #1 the main customer for this is going to be a musician that would like to be a fly on the wall and see how the big boys do it. The interviewer has to plan ahead and ask the right questions. He/she also has to explain why they are putting so much work in to a song that they have been playing for 30 plus years. RAW is worth buying for sure, it just could have been better."
3,A few obvious things missed,"1) PC Backup doesn't recognize my External Harddrive connected through a USB 2.0 port, under Windows XP Professional, even after a re-boot. I have to Browse and point to it each time the software starts up.2) It cannot run an incremental back-up on demand. Instead, an incremental back-up must be scheduled.3) It is slower than Backup which comes free with Windows XP.If you are dissatisfied with Windows XP's Backup, and don't find the features mentioned in the reviews above compelling, I recommend to continue searching for something better."
4,Great Story Time resource!,"This small collection of fingerplays is extremely useful; the first time I picked it up I found at least one fingerplay for every Story Time theme we have scheduled for our library this year. Some of the fingerplays are rather simplistic(hence four stars, instead of five), but the illustrations are simply incredible, and the additional boxed information makes this a good science resource for young children. Highly recommended!"
2,It's OK but,It's OK but half the tools do not really work that well. Knife is sorta sharp. Saw sorta works. Bottle opener is great. Has a handy pouch.
2,I bought it and it was delivered.,"My relationship to this product ends there. I put it in a drawer and will not use it. I am not entirely sure as to why I purchased it in the first place other than I hate using furniture to open beer bottles, the item was cheap and had to the potential to be a clever gadget. In a pinch, I will stick to opening beers with my sandal."
2,Not worth the added pocket weight,"I put this into one of the credit card slots of my wallet. I ended up removing it... it isn't worth the added weight. The tools aren't that useful, the blade is hard to use (hard to hold onto the whole unit). I ended up going with an inexpensive small gerber pocket knife that I put on my keyring. It doesn't stick out any more than a keyfob and is much more useful."
3,Good in a pinch,"This is a solid little tool to keep in your wallet, tackle box or glove box. It is not my first choice in emergency tools but it will do in a pinch. Not a bad little stocking stuffer."
4,Good item for campers for in the glove box,"This little item is great for a wallet, purse or glove box. Weight conscious day hikers may also find this tool helpful. It is sturdy and appears to be suited for occasional use. The exposed sharp edges require that this product be kept well out of the reach of children. For the cost, it is very good deal."
3,"Nice stocking stuffer, but that's about it.","I picked this up to be inexpensive stocking stuffers for my handy man hubby and crafty kid. Good thing they weren't expensive, because they turned out to be alright but not very useful. It's hard to hold and use as intended, but I suppose in an absolute pinch you could figure out a way to make it work. It comes in a nice vinyl pocket, and feels solid. But it's size prevents it from being as multi tasking as intended. My son thinks it's great because lets face it, he's 7 and has never seen something so cool. But about all he's used it for is lightly scraping some wood in the backyard, (yeah, quite the survivalist, haha.)I've spent more on less though, so for the price it's okay."
3,a bit schnazy,"It comes in a little small pouch without added bulk. Okay.but if you check the measurements of the tool itself, it's NOT the size of a credit card. It's actually a lot small and thicker. Took forever to arrive but I can deal with that. My only problems are (1) the measuring increments start about 2cm in and stops 2.5cm out, (2) the lack of smoothness on the etched side (mine has a jacked face going across the length top of just above the measuring lines and it's definitely NOT dirt), and (3) the a few cut out lines are not clean cut.It's decent."
5,Awesome tool,This is a great product for the price mentioned.Everyone can buy and keep this product in their wallet. A must-have for hiking and normal household chores.
2,A WALLET WEIGHT,Over the years these things have been sold. Aside from being intricate and thus appealing they are mostly useless. If marooned in the wilds are you really going to open a bottle of grog? Will you operate small fasteners? Measure your way out?A much more useful tool would be the Ames Jackson Garden Knife! Dig for food. Construct hasty shelter. Defence.Prepare food. Maybe even spear food!I'm thinking TSA might see this in a different light. But if you like trinkets this is it...
1,USELESS,"The only reason I bought this ""Survival Pocket Tool"" was because I had an extra $2.00 on a VISA gift card and this was very cheap and AMAZON PRIME eligible. I do nto know how anyone could call this a ""Survival Tool"" as it offers really no practical survival application with the exception of the Saw and Blade. The Saw is to small to cut anything that a normal person could just snap with there hands and the blade is so dull I doubt I could cut anything with it. All the other tools are pretty useless to me as I carry a Leatherman every day. If you want a REAL multitool buy a Leatherman. The sheath this thing comes with is just some cheap plastic that will surely fall apart with any sort of use. If you have $2.00 to blow of need a few extra dollars to get free shipping than it might be an option for you but I would never suggest this for any sort of every day carry or survival tool."
4,Nice tool - Handy,the metal is thick and strong... knife is sharp... it is a good tool after all with all the tools it has
5,A very important book.,"This is one of the most interesting books I've seen in quite awhile. Well researched and written. In my opinion it is one of the most important books to read for anyone interested in any field of science. It is brilliant as a work on the sociology of science, and as a general warning to all those who pursue truth that the truth you accept today may not be there tomorrow."
5,Alternative science,This is a must if you like the works of Noam Chomsky. We are heading for a scientific dead end unless something is done to correct the institutionalism of scientific research.
4,Sweet,"Hi,I got this gift as a birthday gift from jackie and I would like to say it is amazing. My mom doesnt like the fact tht it gets mesy thowe.I love it. I would share this with any of my friends!"
1,Don't expect too much :),"Just want to make sure no one expects too much from this product, the other review was right, it is very sweet. . . but it is also VERY cheap. Would be a good gift if you're looking for something inexpensive and to provide temporary amusement but the desk barely holds up after just a few uses, the stencils barely work (too small for stencils), nothing really fits together. I bought it because I thought it might be good for in the car but it not nearly sturdy enough to hold on a lap. Again, very sweet for a cheap gift (can't beat the price!) but don't expect much."
1,Import in Disguise,"Wouldn't recommend this at all, most of the songs are not the original recordings but Johnny must have redone them on a tired day in the studio. Others are from live concerts. Save your $$$"
5,Great CD!,"I finally broke down and bought this, after hearing one of his songs again. Figured I just needed to buy a cd so I could listen anytime. There's only 1 song on this that I didn't really know. The rest is just awesome. Love it!A great selection of songs!"
5,Love Celine,I recently purchased the CD Falling Into You by Celine Dion and just love it I love all of her music and this CD was no exception.
4,Not Bad At All . . .,"I'd never before heard Celine Dion (with the exception of ""Love Can Move Mountains"" on my ""Touched by An Angel Album"") and when my friend offered to let me borrow this CD, I grabbed for the chance. Celine has an awsome voice, and her music is fresh and different. My favorite songs (though I like almost all of them) were ""It's all Coming Back to Me Now,"" ""I Don't Know,"" ""Make You Happy,"" and ""River Deep, Mountain High."" Celine's great. Listen to her."
3,Celine's voice drives the album,"Celine's voice is undeniably powerful, but she never seems to pick material worthy of that voice. There are a few songs I like, which are ""Falling Into You,"" ""It's All Coming Back To Me Now"" (a dramatic in a positive way story song), ""River Deep, Mountain High,"" and the closer, ""Fly."" But, most songs are filler types. This is a better album than Let's Talk About Love, which has its share of clunkers. Everyone should have one Celine album for her voice, and this album will do, but I'd recommend her A Decade Of Song CD. Celine would do well to put in some old pop standards if she can't find better material. Or maybe she's not taking the time to look."
5,*Celine Dion Is The Best*,"With me being a HUGE Celine fan I have all of her English CDs, plus 4 French ones and Falling into You is my most favorite English CD by Celine. IT's all coming back to me now * falling into you * and Because youloved me, are my favorite tracks. Do yourself a favor & buy this CD today."
3,4 out of 14,"I liked this cd from Celine, but i found myself only playing 4 songs outof 14. ""Falling into you,"" was beautiful but i mostly enjoyed ""Seduces me,"" because it talks about love, nothing about sex, just love. I feel it says everything that a man and a woman should really feel about each other. Celine's version of Eric Carmen's, ""All by myself,"" was nice and she sang it beautifully. ""Because you loved me,"" was 2nd in my heart to ""Seduces me."""
4,another must album,"Any Celine fan will welcome this album into a collection.Jazzy, snazzy, typical hot celine. Any Celine love song is always a smash, but ""falling into you"" might be one of the best."
4,Singing from the heart...,"From the echo of the chord that introduces the album's first cut (It's All Coming Back to Me Now), this is a journey of the heart. Celine Dion has found the realm of lost love and sings of her discovery. The melodies and words of her music will set your heart on a journey. Listen with one you love as the provocative Celine explores your deepest feelings with such selections as track #5 (Seduces Me). To know such love is to understand the passion captured on this CD, and the spirit that this incomparable vocalist has come to share. This is an album in which Celine finds the perfect way to sing love loud and strong with rhythm and with soul...soft and deep with the voice's most compelling caress. The album FALLING INTO YOU will capture your heart as its melodies linger in your mind and its passion haunts your soul. It is an album that sings from Celine's heart and yours."
3,this one is good,"buy it for the first song. ....this is a good pop songs cd. not her latest cd. hopefully she will release fine albums like this, 1996 was a good year to listen to her songs. cant say for the other years before and after."
1,Never again,"I bought these along with several other pair from the same place. All of which fell apart within minutes of wearing them. The stones fell out of at least one earring of each pair. Seriously? Four pair of earrings and they all lost stones? I was sucked in by the low price for sterling silver and I got stuck with what I paid for. While the company was willing to refund or replace the item with no issues, I would never buy anything from this place again. I could accept one pair falling apart. Things happen. However all 4 pair falling apart doesn't say much for the quality of their items. I've bought silver from several other places with no issues in the quality department. If you choose to purchase these, I suggest you check the prongs and the stones to see if they are loose and try to crimp the prongs to retain the stones."
4,Chasing Shadows,"This book covers the early era of the Lower East Side in the 60's in New York. Grim, but true. Only book I've found covering this start to the history of LES. This book is just like it was - I was there and know."
1,I can't believe this junk was released!!!,this is the saddest excuse for a album i have ever heard... i don't know how anyone can listen to this random onslaught of yelling and rambling.
1,oh to be 13 again,"Yeah, these guys were profound and impressive when I was in the 8th grade, but then I realized that, well...P>But, I'm just as guilty as anyone for giving these guys my money. Hopefully everyone else will realize the error of purchasing their cds like I did..."
3,okay but not great,I like KoRn but I was a little disappointed when I bought this album. i would give it 2 1/2 stars if i could.Twist 3/5 I thought this song was wierd but who doesn't?Chi 4/5 One of the best songs on the cd.Lost 3/5 okay songSwallow 2/5 I thought this song suckedPorno creep 1/5 I despise this songGood God 5/5 I love this songMr. Rogers 5/5 Another one of my favorite songsK@#0%! 3/5 nice but Jon swears throughout the whole songNo place to hide 3/5 okaywicked 1/5 only Jon's parts are goodA.D.I.D.A.S 3/5 good songlowrider 1/5 too shortass itch 2/5 not so goodkill you 2/5 could have been betteroverall- 38/70
4,"Can you say ""Twist""?","All I gots ta say is listen to that opening track called ""Twist."" That is the most amazing piece of vocal work I have ever heard. I never knew the human voice could even do anything like that! Incredible! The rest of the record is well done, too. Jigga what? Jigga who? He-he! --Kelly Magovern"
5,Hmmmm . . . .Cotemplating Genuis,"Lets see, Twist and Chi are lightly disturbing with just two words (i think) between them. Anyhoo, A.D.D.I.D.A.S. Is the best song ever written about a sports product (One I do not wear, I hasten to add.)Excellantly funny, great for annoying your parents,or older realitives.Wicked is great, twisting rap and metal together brillantly witha lighter tone than the rest of the album. Just up my alley.Yet sharing glory with about every other song on the album. Good God is,(what can I stretch my vocabulary to this time?) The stand out song on the albumFoolowing in the blaze of Heavy Glory that was Korn. It would be impossible to pick a favorite title. Anyhoo, before I get taken away by the men in White coats, listen to this album."
4,my pointless review,"this album was put together in a year, according to Korn guitarist Munky, and surprisingly is almost equal to the first. many of the songs have similar opening guitar riffs, which gets old, but the songs quickly prove that they do have original melodies. good tracks to listen to are Good God, Wicked, and A.D.I.D.A.S."
5,fukking awesome,I havent actually bought this cd for myself but im gonna. Its sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!!! MY favourite is A.D.I.D.A.S. all day i dream about i sex!!!! woooohooo!!!
5,great for bangin' around and feelin' the power,"""Life is Peachy"" is a great album and features great songs. Korn made a wider variety than normal in this album of styles of beats. It ranges from rap to real hardcore listening to punk, and then almost a relaxing alterntive beat. It recommend this album for your first album."
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"Their second cd named ""Life is Peachy"" is also a great one released in 1996.TRACKS RATINGS:1-Twist-10/102-Chi-10/103-Lost-9/104-Swallow-8/105-Porno Creep-9/106-Good God-10/107-Mr.Rogers-9/108-K@#*%-10/109-No place To Hide- 10/1010-Wicked-10/1011-A.D.I.D.A.S-10/1012-Lowrider-9/1013-A** Itch- 9/1014-Kill You-10/10OVERALL - 133/140 95%Korn will remain my favorite group of all time no matter how good or bad they get. They have inspired me to play guitar and drums. Lot's of there fans are people who are dealing with problems in there life. If you are listen to Korn to feel better about yourself and others."
2,Worst KoRn album so far.,"How can you people say this is the best KoRn album when it's not that good at all? All songs sound alike, the production is terrible, I mean even the band hates it!!! KoRn have been saying in interview after interview how disappointed they are with the way Life Is Peachy turned out. Only the more odd sounding tracks like Wicked, Lowrider (and those two are not KoRn songs you tossers, they were written by Ice Cube and War), Porno Creep and Twist."
3,REPETITION + INNOVATION???,"Well, i truly love, Korn and all their albums but i must say this one is, well, the worst one. At times its horribly repetitive (chi...), but at times it can truly rock (good god). All in all this CD is a mixed bag, if you are new to korn i recommend u start with the third album or the first, if u really like those then buy this."
2,What is this supposed to be???,"This by far is Korn's worst album in my opinion, I'm not even sure how to comprehend the idea behind this one. ""Nowhere to Hide"" and ""ADIDAS"" are the only good songs on here and the sole reason for two stars instead of one. Other than that, I would say this album was a failed attempt at something, again, not sure what. A lot of people I've talked to say it's among Korn's best efforts, but I choose to disagree. In all blunt honesty, this album is pretty much pure crap!!"
2,ehhhh.....,"yeah, they had some really cool riffs, i mean some really really really good ideas. some of the most of the creative basslines i've ever heard from this hard of a band. but lets get real, the music starts off great then they completely ruin it with cliched riffs that arent melodic. and what about the lyrics??? no offense but these are not very good lyrics. they have more swear words in one song on some of this album then i've heard on a whole album, and yeah, they use them for ""passion"" right? well this cd has passion, but not very creative in my mind. So all in all, i think they had some really really good ideas, and the musicianship is pretty good. but i dont appreciate the really bad lyrics and he has a great voice, why does he scream so much? anyway, thats just my opinion. All in all, great ideas, good musicians, could have done a lot better. Another reason i still gave it two stars are there are some decent, well though out, and good songs on this cd."
4,"Good, but not great","This album was a good sophomore album, but Korn is capable of doing much better. Follow The Leader and Korn are albums that prove that. The band said in a recent interview that they wanted to keep a product out there, and that they forgot to make a good record. I think that it is good, but their other two are much better. It is not quite as angry, the writing is not quite as great, and the sound of the band is not quite as tight. All of that stuff is good on the album, but they are better than this album. There are some bright spots on this album, though. Their cover of ""Wicked"" is terrific, ""Twist"" is a great way to start off the album, and ""Chi"" is a strong track. Overall, it is good, not great, though. I give it about a 3.6."
1,One of the worst albums I ever bought,"I bought this in a sale and the only reason I didn't throw it away was that it completed my Korn collection. I now wish I had never bothered with Korn so much; they can only give you so much pleasure on the best of their albums. The only good song on this album is ""A.D.I.D.A.S."" and even there, the arrangements get sloppy; a cover band would do well to change it to make it smoother. Otherwise, the riffs are repetitive, the lyrics are uninteresting, and the singing is worse than death metal. Do not buy!"
1,just a few comments,"I would would describe any Korn work as stupid crappy lame diluted metal s&*t, if you want real heavy stuff check out Metallica (especially the old stuff), Megadeth, Corrosion of Conformity and other GOOD bands. Korn should learn how to play six strings because they attempt to play 7 string guitars,(leave that to Steve Vai)."
2,well...,"I've tried to listen to this album, as my kids like it. While it has some moments when sounds are somewhat different than what one is used to hear from whatever bands, overall rating is fairly boring. Nothing too special. A lot of noise for not too much message. If you are looking for some music that tries to tell you something, well, this is not the album you are looking for ... Try some early Genesis or Yes instead."
4,more melody is needed,"overall this album is ok for the most part guitar riffs werent too great but the songs still sounded good it had really no melody becouse the instruments were grindy and thrashy , but aside from the non meledic tunes the lyrics are pretty dark and creepy and give you that wierd feeling however the reason it was so grimey was not only for the lack of melody but becouse this ws a bit of a turn point for the band from general guitars(self titled korn)to electronics (untouchables)this i believe was in the middle of all of it anyway they were on a slipperly slope with this and almost messed this one up but they had some songs that kept the album alive like porno creep and a.d.i.d.a.s. and I dont think there will ever be a time were they ever mess an album up"

2,Nothing revolutionary.,"This book is great if you are new to content writing or need a quick go to on your desk. Honestly though I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. This book doesn't have anything that isn't already available for free by a simple google search. If you want a physical printed book to keep at your desk, I would say get this. But if you are like most people, a google search is just as easy and it is free."
1,Bottom of the Dreck Barrel,"I love movie serials. But despite the enticing name ""The Clutching Hand"" looks like a homemovie shot by people who don't know how to make a film move. I lasted through the first two chapters. The pacing is rotten, the inane laughter of the villain gets quite old in a hurry and the cameraman clearly doesn't know the difference between night and day, as so many scenes supposedly at night shift to broad daylight the moment the characters to to an exterior scene. The script or excuse for a script is inane. I gave it one star because as someone else said, for 6.98 what can you expect. This is LOW budget production. Stick with Republic, Universal or Columbia for decent B pictures with mostly excellent cliff-hangers. If they'd had credit cards in 1936, I'd think the buffoons who shot this clunker used their own credit to get the film stock. Purchase only if you want to waste your dough, even 6.98!"
3,The Clutching Hand,"First off, the dvd transfer is lousy, picture grainy, sound crackly. Somehow this adds to the general fun of watching this serial. The plot is hopelessy extended, many episodes pass without really anything happening apart from a few fist-fights and run-arounds. Acting is passable at best. Cliffhangers have cheating resolutions. The actors at times seem to be making it up as they go along. As to the identity of The Clutching Hand, well the reveal was actually fairly creepy. Despite or perhaps, because of, the serials many faults, I enjoyed it immensely."
1,Grossly Disappointing,"Collector of Hearts is another short story collection that centers around grotesque characters and plots. Despite the similarity with themes in Haunted, Collector of the Hearts pales in comparison. In fact, it seems as if Oates has ripped herself off with this collection by using almost the exact same techniques as she did in her previous collection (such as numbering certain segments and arranging the stories in three parts).Similar to Haunted, the stories in Collector of Hearts are almost entirely about family relationships that become violent with physically or sexually. However, they are far more weird and border on being science fiction.I finished the collection but it took a great deal of motivation! I found some of the tales to be terrifying, but not in a ""spooky ghost story"". Instead, it was terrifying in a ""how could someone think of anything this sick and twisted"" way. Perhaps the best word to describe this collection is disturbing."
1,Mityvac,"I recently purchased this tool primarily for bleeding brakes. Despite repeated attempts and following the instructions explicitly, I was unable to develop a vacuum in the bleeder container. The pump by itself could attain a modest amount of vacuum with my finger held against the inlet opening, but the tool did not work as advertised. I returned the tool and am awaiting a refund. (And I bled the brakes without assistance using clear plastic tubing and a small container.)"
3,Works but fair quality,"Pros: Does the job of bleeding the car's brakesHas a lot of attachments for various hoses.Cons: The gage face is plastic and is destroyed by contact with brake fluid. For a tool whose main use is brake bleeding this is serious oversight. The plastic case and parts have a strong chemical odor, that persists after removing from the wrapper."
4,Parental Control Does Work,"I've bought this router because of its parental control also, then spent long hours trying to decode its settings, and finally made it work. Just add a rule, hit ""Apply"", then hit ""Restart"". This last action is necessary! The router works awesome. But I give it 4 stars because of its really cryptic settings..."
3,Ok BUT,"Would be a lot better if it were not for the extremely annoying music and the celestial vocalizations in the background. The language interpreter for the Japanese oceanographer sounds like he is waving pompoms while he translates, and the narrator is a tad obnoxious.It is too bad because it does have some great underwater scenes."
2,not impressed,"I would not recommend this dvd set it is hard to follow due to the fact that 2 narrators are speaking at once ione in english and one in a foreign language, and it does not tell you what the animals are or why they are doing what you see them doing, for example it shows an eel shaking and instead of saying what type of eel it is and why it is shaking it just tells you that the eel is shaking, which is kind of rediculous considering we can see that all ready. I did not find this dvd to be informative at all."
1,Colonial Apologist,"The Nobility of Failure by Ivan Morris, now conveniently out of print, is an elegant rebuttal to most of Dowers beliefs, which seem to be based on the premise that Japans culture was reassuringly American after all."
3,"Dower, Japan, and Iraq","Dower inadvertantly wrote in support of invading Iraq, by writing this book with its title about how the Japanese ""embraced defeat."" Dower shows some of the complexity of the postwar in Japan, and the duplicity of MacArthur's staff and the State Department, but it is still way too rosy a little narrative about how the Japanese became ""like us,"" almost (not quite white), as a result of their defeat. Dower has written articles subsequently regarding the fact that Iraq indeed is not Japan, but too late, damage already done."
2,Non-Sociologists Beware,"If you liked deTocqueville, or are a professional sociologist, you will love this book. Otherwise beware. The amount of detail about blackmarkets, prostitution, and day-to-day survival details is well written but overwhelming. I could not see the forest for the trees!"
4,A very good album,"I bought ""Stoosh"" on the recommendation of a friend, and was not disappointed. The singer, Skin, has an interesting, distictive voice and the songs are mostly well-written. An interesting thing about ""Stoosh"" is that often there are small techno/electronica melodies and vocal samples between songs. Unfortunately, some of the lyrics, particularly the first one, are a bit weak (hearing ""milk is my sugar"" screamed over and over gets real old, real fast). Also annoying is the fact that the hidden track is 30 minutes after the end of the CD, forcing me to fast forward for way the hell too long. But all in all, this album is definately worth your money. Buy it."
5,Greatest CD I own,The music is great. I have some friends who don't usually like Aerosmith who love this CD. I hope that the next one that Aerosmith puts out is as good as this one.
2,Eh......,"Well I am an Aerosmith fan, and a few years ago I thought I should buy there latest album. Well I did, and I can't say i'm to happy with it. There were only about 3 songs that were worth listening to, and the cd didn't work in any pc I put it in. The album art is cool, but the lyrics in the pamplet are out of sync and confusing. I'd say no to this album."
5,MY FAVOURITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME,"I've read a lot about Aerosmith's Nine Lives being a sell out album and I can say that that statement is absolute nonsense.Just because a band that has a reputation for being hard rock does an album that has some quieter songs is selling out?Pink Floyd are beloved of many hard rock fans and would you call their subtle sound selling out ? I think not! I loved Aerosmith before Nine Lives came out but always regretted that so much of their material was too similar. Nine Lives was a true breath of fresh air. I got the tape version for Christmas 2 years ago and for last Christmas I wanted it on CD! I said to my brother that it was my favourite album and he said ""no way!"" After he listened to it he said to me ""you're right that was a good album"" And for my brother to praise anything is almost unbelievable.Buy it folks!"
3,I'm not expecting too much am I ?,This is the last Aerosmith album I have ever bought because I do not like it so there will be no more Aerosmith bought by me. Same stuff they did on the two previous albums and lots of filler.
2,not what I expected,"I have been an Aerosmith fan for years and this has to be the worst album they have recorded, this album did have a few good songs, but not Aerosmith at their best."
2,somewhat dissappointed,"I purchased this because I am enthusiastic about the lessons in the Course in Miracles. What I find I don't enjoy so much about this version is that the reader on audio just reads on and on and on with not much entonation or life in his voice at all. It feels like a supermarket list, a list of chores to do or something like that. After not very long at all, even wishing to hear the message, it is hard for me to continue listening. The form is taking over he essence of it. A pity because it is a spiritual reading I was looking forward to."
2,Good thing he's improved...,"The first novel written by Stephenson, and it's a satire on college dorm life. Pointless, rambling, and bizarre. It's a good thing he's improved his writing over the years, as this one stunk."
1,Easily the worst book I've ever finished,"Stephenson came highly recommended to me, but I assume this book is from before he became a writer. It baffles me somewhat that this book could even make it to print. I feel I should bash the editor the most. There are plenty of other reviews that break down why, so I won't go into depth, but here's some words/phrases that come to mind about this book: tedious, simplistic, juvenile, virginally awkward, skeleton-in-author's-closet."
2,avoid this book,This is a pretty much uninteresting and entirely straight forward story by an author who is a genius of cyberpunk. I bought it on his reputation. Don't you do the same.
4,Slapdash,"I liked it, although like many of stephenson's books, the ending seemed to leave me with a ""huh> it's over already"" feeling - definitely a scattershot work, but pretty entertaining. At times I had trouble telling the different characters apart, but it had the ""psychedelic trip"" feeling of attending big state U - for those of us who did. It wanders around the different cliques and interactions with a slightly different twist (humourous) on them."
2,"Well, it's a first novel.","I'm just glad I didn't pay the exorbitant prices they were asking on Ebay before the re-release. It's an entertaining read, rather reminiscent of Matt Ruff's Fool on the Hill, but it's not even in the same ballpark as Stephenson's later work. Fine for what it is, but for the love of god, forget about Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash, Zodiac, Diamond Age, Spew, and whatever else you can think of before you read it."
4,good clean fun,"Mr. Stephenson's writing is clear and calmin this book. His vision of the Mega Universityis wry and somewhat insightful. This, his first book, is better in some ways than his others because it is more consistant. Instead of a greatstart, good middle and dragging end (Snow Crash),the book ends when the going gets rough. It won'tteach you any deep truths, about life, but if you've been in a university, it will make you chuckle."
2,Satirical comments in search of a story,"Like many people who have read this book, I came upon it after becoming a serious Neal Stephenson fan. Like many others with whom I've spoken, I was seriously disappointed with The Big U. It seemed, on the whole, to be a number of different commentaries on campus life thrown, rather than woven, together into a book that was (amazingly) hard to pick up. I read this book for the sake of completeness, and will likely judge the fervor of other fans by whether or not they've gone through the ordeal. That being said, I do not recommend this book to anyone who is anything short of a Stephenson zealot."
4,Ought to be required reading,"Every kid who thinks that college is all about partying (as well as every financial aid office, registrar, and administrator) should have to read this book. If you're looking for Snow Crash II or Snow Crash the Prequel, forget it. This is much closer to the present. If you've ever been screwed around with at college, or torn at your hair because frat pledges pulled the fire alarm again, or felt like a number, then read this book and read it now. Chances are, your experience wasn't quite as bad as the characters' in this book."
3,Ear Clip Broke,"Used it while driving. Product worked okay, but the ear clip didn't last very long. The clip broke and then the product was basically useless. Someone around my office still walks around wearing one of these things. Don't be that guy."
2,Meh... just ok for the money,"The product is cheap, and you definitely get what you pay for. The volume on my unit was just fine for me. I did receive complaints from the people I was calling saying that they couldn't hear me which was a pain. My biggest complaint however is the way it ""wobbles"" on my ear. Since there is no 'inner-ear' speaker, it's free to move around if you suddenly turn your head when changing lanes on the freeway or any other quick jerk. This was the biggest problem for me because I used it 80% of the time on the road, and when I need to change lanes I don't want to feel like my headset could fall off."
2,Might Work for Small Ears...,"As far as the performance of this as a Bluetooth device, it is fine. But if you are a full-grown man, or if you just have medium to large-sized ears, this device will flop around on your ear, forcing you to have to hold it in place, thus defeating the hands-free purpose.I read a review a while ago that said something like, ""This headset was so loose, that while driving I went around a curve and just the gravity from that pulled it away from my ear."" I though this was an exaggeration and bought it anyway because it was on sale locally.It was no exaggeration, it was the truth and I don't use this device anymore."
4,Good product,Good bluetooyh for the price. I have had no problems at all. This product is recommended.
3,Motorola H350 Bluetooth Headset - Black,"Works pretty well. Uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour, rattles, falls off my ear. (Maybe my head is designed wrong?) Has low volume at even the highest setting which can make the other party difficult to hear, but otherwise the quality of sound is good. It's great not to have a wire dangling, but it's a pain in the ear to wear."
4,Good headset,"Bought this headset for my mom for Christmas. She isn't real fond of technology so I just picked up a basic, easy to use headset with a clear design. Volume up/down and start/end call; those are the only buttons she needed to learn how to use. She uses it daily and loves it so far. The call clarity is good under normal conditions, she hasn't complained about it at all. I would buy another one of these if the need arised."
3,Great blue tooth but...,"I loved this blue tooth. It is easy to turn on... which is my one and only complaint. I keep it in my purse and sometimes if I press against it unknowingly it will turn itself on and call the last call I made on my cell phone. I was there was a sleeve or bluetooth case for it. Other than that, it is easy to use, clear as a bell sound and great price."
1,Save your money!!,"This bluetooth is awful. I hear my caller okay, but all my callers hear is loud feedback, and humming in the background. What a waste of money."
4,It's ok works fine,"It's ok works fine and battery life is very good, I have a motorola i880 ande last sunday for work I had to speak 3hours and, what do you think? the movil power-off first for battery."
3,motorola h350,I expected a little more. But all in all is not bad for the price. Next time I'll get something better.
1,Too loose and floppy,Falls off way too easy. people have a hard time hearing me. I only use it in the car and only stays on if I never move my head at all. Worth $20??? Could be $5 and a more fair price.
3,Does not work well with Treo,"I have a Treo 700wx and have been trying out different bluetooth headsets. This one worked fine for about a week, but after that, I would have to do a soft reset on my phone to get the H350 to connect to my phone. If I used another form of bluetooth (like in my car), I would have difficulties connecting to the H350. I now have a Samsung bluetooth headset. It works great. No issues and it's so small. I highly recommend the Samsung WEP-200."
3,It looks good but.....,"I must say that this bluetooth is really a nice looking conservative earpiece. I have seen the more bulky conspicuous type headgear and I wasn't interested. However, sometimes it is challenging to just hit the button to end a conversation. It seems as if it doesn't 'catch'. I didn't have this problem with my other Motorola. I loaned it to my Dad to see if it would work for him and he had the same problem."
1,Horrible,"This Bluetooth device has HORRIBLE sound quality. Everyone that I talk to on it ask me if I am getting in or out of my car because it makes a dinging sound that is audible only from the other party's phone. I am not happy with this and got it to replace the H500 that I dropped in my driveway. The H500 worked great and people told me that it sounded better than my actual phone. My phone, by-the-way, is a Blackberry 7105T. Maybe it is just the compatibility with my phone, I don't know."
4,Road Trip Grill Pro,Item is a bit heavy but great for my apartment because it can be stored in a small space.
2,If you need info on Ports of Call...look elsewhere,"It's true that this book is called European Cruises IN BIG LETTER and Ports of Call in small letters...but I would not have expected the Ports of Call to be SO tiny. There is a tiny amount of information on the various ports...info that could be found on even the most basic website. I bought the book very cheaply from a reseller, knowing that it was a few years old. I was hoping for a little port insight, because I figure that information hasn't changed much.It was not worth the $4.00 I paid. The cruise line info is almost completely out-of-date. The port info is very surface level. Frankly, even if the latest version of this book was reasonably priced, I wouldn't buy it either because the AMOUNT of useable content is so skimpy."
2,rubbish,"I paid 120 for this box. Initially when it came, i was surprised by how light this box was. They advertise it as 3/4 MDF material used; but it was so light I could pick it up with one hand. My other box was solid and heavy.I had the sub in for 1 day, the sub fell out of the box b/c the screws wouldnt hold. I complained to R/T staff who were very quick to respond and helpful. They sent me T-bolts which i installed as instructed. However over time (just 3-4 weeks) the condition of the box deteriorated. The wood kept splintering and falling apart.They claim this box is tuned to 30 hz. That is not true. And worse of all, when you bump it loud you can see the box actually flexing (it shouldnt do that). Maybe i just got a defective box; but the build quality is awful. I was robbed of $120 by buying this box. Though im not saying R/T is a bad company. I've owned their other products and loved them. But this box is awful and i wish i hadnt bought it.save by building your own"
1,This was awful Cinema,"I never thought I'd say this but Tom Hanks really blew this one! This has to be the most stupid movie I've ever seen. I mean, what's the point of this? It isn't good comedy, it isn't good fantasy, in a nutshell this movie is trash! I'm sure this is the only negative review of this movie but a guy has to speak out if only to save somebody 2 hours of complete boredom. If you only have 2 hours left to live, watch this movie; it will seem like 2 lifetimes! I gave it one star only because I couldn't give it zero!"
5,LOOK PAST THE SURFACE - THIS FILM TRUELY HAS A SOUL,"What a surprise to see that so many others have given this film such high marks. I've seen so many people bash this movie simply because it was over their heads. One line from the film sums it up: ""Almost the whole world is asleep: Everybody you see, everybody you know, everybody you talk to. Only a few people are awake and they live in a state of constant, total amazement"".The ""awake"" ones are those who can see beyond the somewhat corney texture this film shows on the surface, down into the highly stylized depth of this film's soul. This is a film to make your heart swell and your spirit soar."
4,"Groundhog day, with a volcano.",One of those stories that makes you think. I liked it. I realised a little way into it that you really have to pay attention to the dialogue because it's like listening to a crazy person who makes sense but only if you really listen - instead of just waiting for your turn to talk.
5,It does the job.,"Not too much to say about this guy except that it works and works well. This is the second one I've purchased for use with my two Phillips DVD players which, unlike many other brands, favor the coaxial over optical digital audio connections. Nicely constructed with thick yet flexible shielding. At a considerable savings over high-end cables such as Monster, this does the job for me."
4,"Nice gadget, keeps image steady","At first glance this appeared to be almost too small to use, cheaply made and the clamp too tiny. Wrong on all impressions. It is well made, small, but easy to use, and the clamp opens very wide! The cable is long - you can mount the camera several feet away or on a tripod. I use it with my Bogen video head - the clamp opens more than enough to accommodate the handle - plus it has rubber pads on both sides, so it grips firmly. The only negative point - the remote only has two zoom speeds. Slow and fast. My camera has a variable zoom, and I really like it.It took a little getting used to the zoom speeds, but it was not that big a deal.The biggest advantage is that I can geep my hands off the camera and on the tripod. This keeps the shots steadier!"
2,Not even close.,Ron Howard was simply too old and clumpy for the part. The rest of the effort was equally out of balance. In my view this effort was wrong from the start and turned into one of the best examples of how not to do or treat Twain's most signature caracter.
4,jazz house grooves,"i purchased this cd because i was curious the title sounded like it had some serious grooves on it and guess what it did, the musicians on this cd are correct. this cd will satify the house music side of you and the jazz side of you some good solid hard knocking beats that will get keep your but moving,and some tight jazz that will leave you wanting more."
1,"Horrible product! No support, doesn't even work!","This product will not work for most applications. If you are looking for a device to allow your wired computer to access the internet, then this will work for you.If you expect to be able to access the wired device across the wireless network, then this device will not work. I had bought two of these units, one for a TIVO connection, and the other for a VOIP phone. Neither device worked.The WE800G would allow the wired device to establish network connections, but not to accept them (95% of the pings attempts would fail). The only time you could connect was if the wired device was in the process of making an outbound connection.Motorola support is horrible. No firmware updates, and no solution. I asked for an RMA, and they warned me that they would replace the unit, but I should expect the same functionality out of the new unit.It's junk! Stay away."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"This is my second one of these bulbs. The first lasted about a year, but the wife liked to leave it on all the time. In a kitchen with all halogen or florescent bulbs, the yellow of this one really stands out, but I'd consider it to be similar to other incandescent bulbs. If anyone sees one that's halogen, please let me know. I'd take one of those over this guy. For the price though, it certainly is an easy choice."
5,Excellent calculator,"I've recently purchased a HP 33s.This calculator is simply excellent value for money, the best on the market.Unjustly, many have critised this calculator. Claiming everything from; the decimal point is too small to the chevron keyboard ""looks"" cluttered.These claims are just silly petulant nonsense. HP and Kinpo have done a great job in making this calculator.This unit lives up to what you expect from a quality HP unit. Comfortable to hold, ""postive"" HP key clicks and chock full of power.This is a calculator that you will use everyday.I have no hesistation in recommending the HP 33s to anybody who is looking for a high-quality, durable and value for money scientific calculator."
3,Electrical PE's Beware...,"If you are planning to take the electrical PE exam, be careful in using the HP33S for AC calculations. IT DOES NOT HAVE A MEANS TO EASILY DO PHASOR ARITHMETIC FOR AC CALCULATIONS. With the older 48G and 48GX models you could easily do vector arithmetic by directly putting in phasor quantities in terms of Magnitude and Angle. You could load as many of these onto the stack as typcially needed. With the HP33S, you have to do confusing dot product and cross product manipulations using a program. This is too time consuming and mistake prone for the PE Exam. This is expecially true if you are taking the POWER systems afternoon portion of the exam..."
5,Decent Calculator,I am just getting used to it. I still have a couple of years before I take the P.E. exam (I hope that it is still allowed on it). Previously used HP 48GX. RPN input is the way to go. This calculator can do both RPN and algabraic input though. I like the size and weight as well.
3,33s,"We got this calculator for the PE exam. I like the 48G much better, but is you have to have this one it is okay. The 48G has so many more features and a taller stack as well. It is easier to enter matricies as the screen can show more than three lines at a time."
5,Newest Version has improved Display,"I have purchased 2 hp33s calculators, one right after it was introduced and one recently and there has been a definite improvement of the display on the latest calculator. There is more space between characters, which makes the decimal point much more visible. This one change corrected the biggest flaw in this model, and in my opinion, makes the hp33s the most practical scientific calculator on the market today.Don't be fooled by old display models, the latest LCD is more than acceptable."
2,"Well ,,not the one I am looking for",The arrangement of the keys are not made professionally! The case and wieght is not as HP style and it moves with any touch tone!If you are HP user don't buy this particular one!
3,hp 33s,"If you're hunting for a replacement for your hp 48, don't buy this calculator. What I find most useful on the hp 48 series is the abiltity to solve multiple equations using the list function w/ MSOLVR. You won't find either function on the hp 33s."
4,Buy from HP,"This is a great Calculator, but if you buy it directly from HP you can get it for $36 Bucks."
2,Don't just Don't,Get the 35s it is orders of magnitude better. It seems they used a dart board and a blindfold when deciding on the layout of the keyboard. Worst of all is there is no way to see the decimal point without a magnifying glass. The only positive thing is that it can be set to RPN (postfix notation) mode.
2,Great calculator BUT the keypad is garbage bring back 15C!,"I love RPN calculators. Saw this one and was thrilled to see an RPN calculator that did NOT have the graphing capability. Not everyone needs a calculator for the SATs; some of us work for a living. After a month the '8' key started sticking. Another friend of mine is on his 2nd calculator because of key pad issues. The '+' died on his. He is now looking at a Casios becasue the HP customer service support blew him off when he asked for 3rd calculator. I'm still using mine, but once the '8' finally dies I'm looking elsewhere.The following is an online petition to get the 15C back into production. These old HP calculators are going for $150-400 on ebay. Unreal!http://hp15c.org:8080/"
4,"Calculator is great, but arrived with dead batteries","This calculator is excellent, and the only option I could find that still supported RPN. I have used RPN calculators for so long, I really don't want to switch over to algebraic notation. The calculator is a good replacement for my long-serving but now dead HP.The only problem is that mine arrive with dead batteries, so I had to go out and spend $6 more for fresh batteries before I could use it. I suppose it must have been stored with pressure on one of the buttons that kept it turned on until the batteries died, because there were no other anomlies with the packaging."
1,Keep your HP32SII,"Bought and returned to campus bookstore. Unusable.Keypad design is annoying and bad. Why did they do this? Is it supposed to be cool?Comma and Decimal are single-pixel. Easy to make mistakes. Again, why did they do this?I'm off to ebay to buy a used HP32SII. I recommend you do the same. HP is not what it used to be. What a pity"
4,A nice book,"Maya as a computer program is wonderful. I like it much more than 3d studio max. I think this program is gaining market share and will continue to, especially since it is cheaper than 3d studio max.This book clearly establishes the pros and cons of Maya versus 3d studio max, and how to use it. Very nice."
5,Frech Pop alternative to american junk,"Is nice to find alternatives like this one to English speaking pop without sense, and alternative music that sounds so silly and conformist.FRENCH culture rules!!!!!!"
4,"Almost 5 stars, but not all of the stories would justify it","I loved his first book, but never got around to reading the second one, as people I've talked to have generally been disappointed with it.I picket up this for two reasons: the exquisite cover and the fact that I'd read a few of the stories on McSweeney's that I'd liked a lot. I read it in a matter of hours, and was generally very very satisfied.I would give it 5 stars just for 3 of the stories: I absolutely loved ""The Only Meaning of the Oil-Wet Water"", ""Quiet"" and ""After I was thrown into the River and Before I died"". They were stunning.However, this book won't get 5 stars of me because lame gimmicks such as ""There are some things a man should keep to himself"". It's too clever, not funny anymore.But all in all, highly readable, and at times downright brilliant. Dave Eggers is a great talent, and I'm already hungry for his next offering."
3,"Women, Politics and the American Society",This book arrived in a timely fashion and in great condition. It has been very useful. I would recommend this product.
2,HoHum,"I dont want textbooks to tell me what to believe. I want judgement-free data. I know it is increasingly difficult to come across textbooks without a leftist slant, but that doesnt make it any less disappointing when I have to use one."
2,Short stories that failed to engage me,"A collection of four short stories of varying lengths which seem to reflect the author's desire for Holmes and Watson to investigate cases in the north of England, presumably not too far from the author's current and/or childhood home.While readable, I found these stories not particularly enjoyable and I was easily distracted from them. I was annoyed by the names that are employed to conceal the ""identities"" of the people involved - the Rt. Hon. Treasure Fortune M.P. indeed! Krihc House near the village of Chirk. And why the strangely named Inspector Indigo Strap insists on calling Captain Rufus Carrick ""Capting"" is not plain to me.Underlying this are four stories which, while not bad, are sub-Conan Doyle in their content. Not a book I could recommend."
4,Frommers Travel Guide,Was very helpful in planning my honeymoon to the Virgin Islands. Very informative and reader friendly
2,Wrong Book,We are going to the British Virgin Islands. I thought this book was only for the British Virgin Islands. It is not. Only about a quarter of it is.
4,Great read!,"I would have liked Nadia to find out about Laurie and Suzy. Also, I want to see more of the new romance develop in some of the stories."
3,A fun ride,"Jill Mansell is one of my favourite chick-lit authors. She writes in such an easy style, her books are the kind that you can just pick up and read from end to end, and put them down with a smile on your face. This wasn't one of her best, I feel. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy reading it, but not as much as many of her others. The characters were a little shallow, and it was all a little too predictable. There also was not too much of a story attached. A teeny bit boring if I have to really probe deeply into the covers. But saying that, it was easy to read, it took my mind away from my real life problems, and I went a long for the ride..."
5,Perfect AV cable!,"I purchased this cable to use with my iPod, after learning that Apple had simply switched the leads when they manufactured their own ""iPod AV cable."" They did that to trick people into purchasing their own AV cables. At any rate, this AV cable by Sony is higher quality than iPod's, has good length, and works with iPods (and various other video products I'm sure). For the iPod, simply plug the red plug into the video port on your TV and the yellow plug in the red port on your TV.Update: I've used this cable for several years, and it still works great. I just wanted to make sure people knew this cable will not work for video with newer iPods...and it won't work with any iPhones. The newer Apple products require that the A/V cable have an authentication chip before it will open the TV Out option. Bummer."
5,It works for my Sony DCR-TRV130,The cable works well for a Sony DCR - TRV 130 digital video recorder. It is the cable that plugs into the camera and lets you play to a TV or other device with RCA type inputs. I used it to transfer family movies from the camera to a DVD recorder. The quality seems to be very good.I highly recommend being careful who you buy from as there are apparently a lot of knock offs out there. I highly recommend buying directly from Amazon or go to the reviews of the sellers to see if they are shipping quality cables.
1,Does not work,"Tried connecting it to camcorder, and other devices. Does not work. Shows fuzzy picture, no sound. The connections are pretty simple so it's not user error."
4,Sitting on top of the world!,"This cd starts incredibly good with the first 5 songs. Let It Rain, Birmingham, Fall From Grace, and Dark Horse are great popsongs, but Beautifull Goodbye is defenitly the best song. The other songs are lovely to listen to but they don't have the inpact like the first songs I mentioned. All the songs have great lyrics (witch are not all written by Amanda), and all have a little story to tell. This is a very satisfying buy, and I recommend it to everybody who likes popmusic."
5,Totally Brilliant,"I was introduced to this amazing performer via ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" soundtrack. Like her many other fans, I found myself playing and replaying the track on this cd to the point where I simply HAD to have a CD of only her work.This CD has been replayed and replayed to the point of distraction for my fellow workers and roommates - that they love it makes it just a little better!I have to admit that I was mightily disappointed that there is not a second CD available as yet. There is an expression in Australia ""Do yourself a Favour"" and this time I have to admit that this is true."
4,Great collection of women's poetry,"From the back cover: ""This is a rich and exciting collection of contemporary women's poetry for the 1980s. Selected and introduced by Marge Piercy, and celebrating the diverse racial, ehtnic and cultural experiences of poets from all over the United States, it includes such well known names as Meridel Le Sueur, Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich as well as rising new poets like Joy Harjo, Celia Gilbert and Sharon Olds. Bringing together brand new poems and some of her own favourites, Marge Piercy shows that women are writing powerful, witty and moving poetry. There are personal poems, political poems, love poems -- a veritable feast...."
4,A lovely CD,"I bought this CD for my 6 years old little sister. She is the Pingu super fans. She like this CD very much. Everyday, she ask us to play it for her, we found that the lovely sound of this CD really cheers her up."
5,perfect gift,Got this as a gift for a friend who's life long dream is to go to Ireland. She was totally surprised.
2,Ditto,I'll save you some time. Read the Sept 30th post from a Reader from Zurich. I couldn't have said it any better. This book was shallow and a disappointment.
3,"Too much talk, not enough hockey.","The story was good, but I wanted to see more hockey played than talked about. It was a good team, the fellas were interesting, but what they could do on ice was the reason I bought the disc."
5,Nice addition to our library,"My daughters love this book, and I do too - it's a nice little way to bring God's messages into our home in such a simple and beautiful way. This is a lovely book, and I'm glad we added it to our collection."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND for anyone with young girls!!,I actually have given this as gifts because it's something for a girl to really cherish and keep her entire life. It has some great wisdom. It would be great to read to them even when they are very very little and continue to as they grow up so these simple but powerful truths are planted deep into their precious little hearts. I saw this in a Cracker Barrel but used my Android Amazon App and scanned it and it was much cheaper her plus it's easier to send to people from Amazon. I just can't say enough about it. I think every church and school nursery should have one to. It is a great book.
4,a nice little unit,"Pros: This mic is easy to install and easy to use. Simply slide it onto accessory shoe and plug it in. This is a stereo mic that can be switched from a 90 to 120 degree cone of focus. Nice features included are a foam wind buffer and a cloth storage bag.Con: Although plugged into the camcorder, you must turn it on/off manually. Not so bad once you have trained yourself to remember to turn it on before shooting, but before that, expect to capture some video without capturing the audio (once plugged in, the mic is the sole source of audio).Overall: greatly improved audio. I am spoiled now and will always use aux mic for camcording."
5,Still crazy after all these years,"Like those younger days of America's album, Alibi has been a classic hit together with the View From The Ground. A neatly done album which Ive been looking for 15 years but could not be find here in Asia. When I listened from them again,I just realize that Im still crazy after all these years with Alibi.If you are new to America, hear more from them in this Alibi album. Youll fall in love with them more."
1,"great album, poor remastering","this is a great album but the remastering was unusually loud & harsh. i prefer the excellent 2006 BGO remaster that also includes ""Silent Letter""."
3,DECEPCIONADO,"ESTE DISCO NO EL QUE YO ESPERABA.NO SE LE ACERCA A HOLIDAY ,HARBOUR O HEARTS.SUS CANCIONES SON ABURRIDAS Y MONOTONAS.UNA VERDADERA DECEPCION"
1,Very short bulb life,"I bought this bulb as a replacement for the original driver's side headlight bulb for my Honda Ridgeline. I installed the bulb in July 2010, when my truck was 4 1/2 years old and had approximately 50,000 miles on it. Fast forward to now, the end of December 2010, and the bulb has already burned out.Amazon had a great price on this bulb when I bought it, but considering that it only lasted 6 months, now it doesn't seem to be such a great deal. I did not notice any difference in lighting quality with this bulb versus the OEM bulb that is still going strong on my passenger side headlight. I would not buy this bulb again, especially considering the premium cost that is normally charged over normal halogen bulbs."
5,Great game for all ages.,"Love this game, my kids range from 5-15 and they all love playing this game. Even parents and grand parents can play competitively and not feel left out."
3,"solid, but not a killer","I like the album but he still lacks the power you hear on the""smooth criminal"" mix. If you are a DJ and need a new jacko cdbecause you wore out your old one, then this is the one to lookfor."
2,the beaded object,"I was absolutely smitten by the beauty of the projects in this book. While I have done some beading in the past I have not tackled flowers so I jumped in. Unfortunately, I soon found out that the instructions are not well written. If you can read you should be able to make anything described. There are many steps left out. What a waste. I would not recommend this book for the beginner to learn from."
2,When Will a Better Transfer Be Released?,"Buy at your own discretion Alpha Video's version of ""Love From a Stranger"". What would be a great movie and probably Ann Harding's best performance - at least that I've so far seen - is such a bad transfer that I looked at the back of the box thinking, ""Well, I guess it was a very early movie"", only to find that the movie was released in 1937.If there isn't another version to choose from yet, unless you just must have it, I'd wait in the hope that some other studio will release a version worth paying for."
4,very good for newbie,"I'm a newbie at harvesting my own meat. This book is just great. The photos are outstanding. I just wish they would have shown some more ""sub-steps"" in the process. Perhaps I am wrong, maybe it's really easy and any ""sub-steps"" would have been a waste...maybe it's just easy and makes sense when actually doing it. So what I'm saying is that I don't quite have the authority to be quoted on this subject."
5,Excellent Guide for the Novice or Seasoned Sportsman,"I have been using this guide to Dressing & Cooking Wild Game for several years. I bought it when I was first starting hunting big game to assist me with dressing and preparing the meat for storage or cooking. The detailed photos and descriptions helped guide this novice through the processing of Wild Game by showing many tricks I would never have found on my own. Birds, small and big game, field dressing, to cooking, to the table. This guide is a must for any sportsman's library. AND IT HAS SOME GREAT RECIPES AS WELL."
3,A Good Video for Paul fans,"This is a good video from Paul but it is not his best work by far. His later vids have much better singig and sound quality. Of course technology has improved way more than when this was shot. Another thing that troubled me was that this was not one show, it is clips from the whole tour pieced together. We are talking in just one song the band could turn up in two to three different outfits making it quite funny to see. All in all it is still a good piece of history for one of The Beatles."
2,Program link not good,I ended up buying this by mistake. I started looking for a Paul Mccartney's CD music but somehow this DVD pop in and I assumed I'm still looking on a musical one. The links you applied on your site is so mess up to make a sale that its more frustrating for the customer when choosing a product.
1,WORST PIECE OF ELECTRONICS EVER MADE-,"YES, IT WAS REFURBISHED BUT WITHIN 6 MONTHS I HAD TO BUY NEW LAMP KIT FOR ALMOST $300 THEN A BLACK MARK APPEARED AT TOP OF SCREEN & IT WILL COSTS $600 TO FIX IT!!! ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM TOSHIBA AFTER LETTERS, EMAILS & CALLS. WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY."
5,"If you have TMJ, you simply must read this book","The other reviewers have said it very well. The exercises provided me immediate relief (Search Inside the book for ""exercise,"" and you can do them while you're waiting for shipment!)I really like the approach he takes - conservative, and taking all causes into consideration (dental, joint, and muscular.) He rightly points out that dentists, surgeons and doctors all tend to see it through their own filter, and he takes a broader view so you can consider them all.I cannot stress enough though how the elimination of coffee has helped me. This is extremely difficult, and I can't always stay away -- but every time I drink some, I end up with pain and tension.I also recommend the ""Stop TMJ and Teeth Grinding"" CD by Scott Sulak. I woke up in significantly less pain after the first use."
1,plain talk for confusing times,I purchased this book because of all the rave reviews it got and the number of books that have been sold. It's a sad state of affairs if America is buying this garbage in as huge a quantity as it says they are. I found it to be pure fiction and without any intrinsic value.
1,Save your money!!,"I was searching for a more natural perfume alternative to commercial products so I thought I would try this. It smells like Endust dusting spray. I asked my husband what he thought it smelled like and he said ""Lemon Pledge.""Maybe some of their other fragrances smell nice but this one literally stinks......the shells are teeny, tiny, in the bottom of the glass. The spray is clear so just looks like water.The ingredients are listed on the bottle except for last ingredients which only read ""other essential oils"" which concerns me because of possible allergic reactions to unknown sources.Save your money and try another product!!!!If you want ocean type smell try an air purifier ionizer."
5,Yoga Means Union,"This book is meant as a precursor to meditation, to be read and re-read, pondered upon and read again.Sitting on a cushion and meditating may be good to relieve stress, however true insight comes effortlessly after first perfecting ones intellectual understanding of ultimate truth and reality.Only after this perfection, which is clearly outlined in this sutra, will meditation yield results beyond mere mystic states. As stated above, the sanskrit word ""yoga"" means union, and this text is a translation of the Buddha's teaching which outlines the perfection of intellectually understanding the functioning of Mind and consciousness and the right frame in which to apprehend ultimate truth (ones union with ultimate truth is then free to follow).Liberation is one thing, and you may gain it in meditation, but only after perfecting your intellectual understanding can reason come to its conclusion and meditation yield concentration and contemplative results effortlessly."
2,The story continues...,"The story continues, but Joey Wong plays a different character. Somehow she was reincarnated and this is the main problem with the movie for me. I wanted to see Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung continue their relationship, but instead Leslie Cheung comes to the realization that she is not the ghost he fell in love with in the first movie. Joey Wong plays a mortal and she and others are trying to rescue Ku feng from being executed. The cast is a lot stronger than the first movie but the story just isn't as good.2.5/5"
5,How can you disagree?,"This is to cancel Fred's so called ""review"". You can bet such an orator has vast knowledge and profound wisdom. Too much sugar and prescription drug abuse I suspect...poor soul."
5,Passion Meets Practicality,"I had the pleasure of meeting Ron Brind when taking the C.S. Lewis Tour in the winter of 2005. I wish I had had his book then! To have read this fabulous book before my trip would have added to the enjoyment. Ron is knowledgeable about his subject and considerate about how he presents his material. I feel I could rent a car and take the trip myself without any apprehension about getting lost. Add to this the personal touches of his childhood memories about C.S. Lewis and you have a unique guide book to accompany you on your journey. Honestly, when you have done with reading `A Guide to the C.S. Lewis Tour in Oxford' you might have trouble remembering if the bits you recall were something you read or if you had actually been there! Read the book and treat yourself to the tour; you will be touched by the passion Ron Brind brings to the memory of C.S. Lewis, as well as his ambitious desire to preserve the material legacy Lewis left behind."
2,Barely suitble for home use.,Purchased to replace aging 10-key for our bookeeper. We had to replace this unit within months as the keys have to be beaten on forcefully to be recognized. Very lightwight and chintzy. Put your money towards a more expensive unit and you will be much happier!
4,Whatever did happen to Napoleon?,"This is a story of Napoleon on St. Helena, not on Elba as stated by previous reviewer. (Napoleon was originally imprisoned on Elba from which he escaped. After his defeat again by the British, he was held on St. Helena in the South Atlantic for the remainder of his days.) It was very interesting to read about a time and place that so little is written elsewhere. The book tells of Napoleon's life, that he was not actually imprisoned, but simply held on the island and not allowed to leave. Napoleon was stuck away on the island of St. Helena in the middle of the South Atlantic and mostly forgotten about in most of the rest of the world. But one woman does meet him."
5,Outstanding Costain novel once again.,Story centers around Napoleon after he has been defeated and his incarceration on Elba. Learned quite a bit about that time era and Napoleon.
3,"Great Series, weak Book 8","Pub:""Mr Jordan POD is great, but we have to milk the public for all its worth...so why don't we break this book into 2 parts...POD short version and then in Nov' we can release the 2nd part ""Winters Heart"". Each previous book had an ""episode"" quality. Meaning there was some conclusion while keeping the series alive. I got the impression POD was severely chopped up by the editor. Examples: Just when Egwene's Rebels are about to launch an attack.. cut ! Perins wife gets in trouble, he's on his way to rescue her...cut ! No mention of Matt (Is he dead or alive ?), er sorry Robert take that out, we can bring him in part deux ""Winters Heart"". This is the first time in the series I've seen such shoddy work. Maybe Jordan is struggling to continue series, maybe the publishers know the series is coming to a close...maybe thats why their stretching it. For the record, I'd did buy this book and and will continue buying them. Like I said great series !"
2,"This book did nothing for the whole of the ""WOT""","I waited for this book, I was excited, and now I'm rather disapointed. I read it in a few days of picking up the book, but it was not becasue I couldn't put it down. I just wanted to see if anything happened. And nothing did. Nothing built, nothing happened, nothing new was discovered. Only a bunch of filler added, new people who are flat, with no details, lots of new names, but nothing happened. It was a waste of money and time. Skip it and wait for the next book, you'll miss nothing. Oh, yes, Rand's little battle, and the run for the crown, and the start ofpatching the white tower oh, let's not forget the botched raid on the Black tower. Humm, did I miss anything."
1,More is less,"Jordan earned the comparison to Tolkein with the first three books. But folks, its time to admit that Jordan is no longer in Tolkein's league. With Tolkein you feel every word has its place. Not so with WoT. For the fourth book in a row we slog through reams of numbingly pointless prose to pick up too few worthwhile plot developments. The characters, so fascinating in their early development, have now largely stagnated. The plot inches forward book by tedious book. At least the torpid middle volumes of the Covenant trilogies were confined to one book. Enough already. I now feel my time (and my money) are being wasted."
4,**Sigh** Another year and a half to find out about Matt,"I have anticipated since I found out the name of the book was going to be ""Path of Daggers"" that it would be mainly about Matt since it is a Seanchan saying about the ""Heights of power are paved with paths of daggers"", and since matt is obviously going to marry the seanchan empress, WHERE IS HE??I thought it was pretty good overall, but I miss the fast paced action from the first several books. I really hope that he does not take as long to deliver the next one. Some days I think all 9 Star Wars movies will be out before this series is complete."
2,I'm getting board!,"I've read all 8 books and I have to say ""I'M GETTING BOARD! "". I wish RJ would hurry it up! I think he should finish up on the next book , so we all can find out what happends. Then he can start a new seires if he wants to. I think the begining of the seires was great, but I'm starting to think he's lost his talent. I have to amit though, that I am hooked. I just wish he would hurry it up."
2,PoD 2 Stars - Series 6 Stars and declining,"I like many of you love the series, but am disappointed with PoD. One must admit the character development in the series is very good, but PoD did not enhance the series, it detracted from it. RJ seems to be generating quanity rather than quality.Mr. Jordan please get on with it!!! I only hope #9 is on par with LoC. I will perhaps wait a little longer before buying the next book or maybe check it out at the library."
2,Not worth the wait,"What a disappointment! Robert Jordan seems to have cashed in the fact that readers who have read this far are going to keep reading no matter what. This book is about 570 pages of filler and 20 of set up for the next book. Since you're going to have to wait a couple of years for the next book anyway, why not just wait for the paperback? or better yet, get it from the library."
2,A 600 page prologue,"I think RJ might be running out of steam, as this book seems to have been nothing more than a prologue for the new couple books. Reading through customer comments, I have to agree with some things. I rate this book 2 stars, as he still has talent in writing, though his editors suck. But in all honesty, i think its mostly males who read his WOT books, and males like action...not reading about women doing this and that. I know its IMPORTANT to set up the plot, but it could have been done better, and only the last 80 or so pages caught my attention. As a reader of much literature, i predict the next book SHOULD be much, much better...if I am wrong, I think that is when i will stop buying his and all TOR books. Also I think RJ should listen to his readers and not take his sweet ass time writing...unless of course he is ""all dried up"" which is what on the surface it appears to be."
1,the wheel of time needs a little oil id say,"RJ seems to be quite lost as his caracters become more and more transparent as their world becomes an unending soap opera (days of our lives?) Rats, i really liked the first ones, he worked hard on them, the last ones just seem uselessly diluted. Oh, and really, please stop citing Tolkien, there are two very different categories here (MacDonalds vs a fine french dinner, id say)"
2,How much?!,"I've finished reading the book, after I have waited about a year and a half, and I have been greatly disappointed. Why does keep doing that? Aren't there enough characters, plots, sub-plots and mischief for several parallel universes? I love the series, know it by heart (as any human light-loving being can) and I hope that RJ will bring us a big (obviously), finale that will leave us with wide-open eyes. I certainly hope so."
2,Not the best of the series. Drawn out & confusing.,"I have really enjoyed this series, but this book was disappointing. Where was Mat? Why after all this time, hasn't something definitive happened? I am ready for the conclusion of this series and thenon to the next. Too much tiny detail and not enough real action. Rand is too powerful to stumble around for all these thousands of pages."
1,"Well, I was robbed.","To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement, I really don't appreciate being held to ransom, buying the book because I love the series (the best in fantasy in my humble opinion), and then feeling like I have been duped. I mean did I fall asleep or did nothing really happen for nearly 600 pages, quite impressive. Sorry Mr Jordan but I would like my money back."
3,"Robert Jordan, what were you thinking!","Robert Jordan is an amazing author, and The Wheel of Time is an amazing series, but this book was definitely NOT amazing. While ""The Path of Daggers"" is not horrible it is definitely not up to Robert Jordan's usual standards. My first major complaint about this book is its plot, or more precisely, its lackof. The plot moved no where in this book. Not one truly significant or surprising thing happened. My second major complaint is that my favorite character, Mat, is not in the book AT ALL. He is a necessity. Unlike Perrin, Mat is the series comic relief, and its most amusing character. Without him, the book is just dull. Also, the main character Rand is begining to become boring. All Rand does is think about how he is going insane, and worry about what he's going to do next. He shows no emotion, which doesn't make for a very exciting character. All I can say is that I hope that Jordan's next book is a whole heck of a lot more exciting than this one was."
3,Wheel of Torture,"As a book, I rate it average. As a part of an ""epic"" series, I would give it zero stars. Favorite character, snubbed. Bickering of women, no longer amusing. Lack of plot progress, infuriating. I hope Jordan bounces back or disappointment will reach ""epic"" proportions."
2,I thought that this book was poorly done.,I thought this book was a real big let down. It seemed Robert Jordan tried to throw a book out at the readers. This coming from what I thought is one of the great fantasy writers of the times. I just hope that his next book is better.
2,Departure into the realm of infinite drivel,"I once believed WoT was THE best fantasy series ever written. You actually became a part of the world that RJ created. However, with this book and the last, it has become nothing but a backwash of purple prose and mindless drivel. No plot movement(well, maybe at a SLOW snail's pace), no excitement, no AURA. That seems to be what's missing, the need to read further to see what happens to the characters we came to care about. The mystery and enchantment is gone, replaced instead by endless descriptions and repetitions of plot lines and character traits we have heard so often before. Please RJ, return this series to the form that made it impossible to put down. Resurrect the mystery and the clearly defined points of good and evil rushing toward the ultimate climax. You've developed the characters enough, now it's time for the points to meet and be resolved. I'll hang in there for book 9 but please don't disappoint again!"
3,We are still nowhere near the end!,"Why do i get the distinct impression that Robert Jordan has no idea how to end this epic story? When i started to read these books,i was hooked on the plot,the characters and the background,in which these characters were placed.But now the story has become a plodding nuisance,with no real pace to it,the story has become bogged down in its own history.The first four books were a joy to read,with many an afternoon spent immersing myself into the magic tappestry that jordan had created.Now i find that i am not really looking forward to the books coming out as i used to be. This is not to say however that i wont be reading them anymore of course."
2,Impressively dissappointing,"Like most other Jordan fans I anxiously awaited PoD, and like most I was very dissappointed. It was 500 pages of braid pulling, talking to oneself, and pondering the complexities of the opposite sex. I'd have been better served buying ""Men are from Mars.."". If you're into soap operas.. long drawn out pages of filler then this book is for you. It's just a shame how such once great writing could deteriorate to this completely lame excuse for a story. I give it 2 stars - One star because the series (prior to this point) was pretty good, and the other, because the cover artwork is pretty good."
3,Robert Jordan's done better,"I thought the book was not one of his better works. It was all the charactors moving around alot and not really doing anything. And it didn't even mention Mat Couthon at all, and he is one of the more colorful charactors. Hopefully the next book will be better,""Come on Robert, don't be dragging out the story line!"""
2,slow - a Jordan letdown,Rand Al'Thor makes first apperance at books 1/2 point. Little or no new ground is covered. More of the same. 2 stars based on prior books.
1,Horrible,"I loved the first couple of books in the ETW series. However, the series have been in serious decline lately. There is no plot. My heart does not even waver as I read. Why should it? No one ever dies. What suspense is there? I bought the last two books just to ""see what would happen"". I will not do so with the 9th. This series shouldn't ended long ago."
1,"""Stab the reader in the back, again"" would be a better title","I am geting a little tired of shelling out $27+ for a book that contains relatively no action. This reminds me of a psychology book: pages of words with little to no meaning. Either Mr. Jordan has lost his way telling the story, or he has no idea of how to end it. I don't know how many readers going to continue paying $27+ for essentially garbage. Maybe the series should be retitled ""Wheel of Pain"" of ""Waste of Time."" Matt doesn't even appear in this book, but is talked about as having ""important work to do."" Get real, and get the story over. Borrow somebody's copy of this book, but DON'T buy it. Maybe lack of sales will be Mr. Jordan's motivation."
4,Too high expectations,"Many people waited long for this book, and therefore had very high expectations. Too high in my opinion. The book is a average book in the series, and doesn't bring any new information on anything. But it is not before we have the next book that we really can judge the path of daggers. tPOD builds you up towards the next book in much bigger degree than any of the previous, and it might look like the end of the book has been cut out to be printed in the next. When the next book comes everyone will probably see why the path of daggers is a good book."
2,Bad.,"I haven't really been looking forward to reading the next book in the series since the weak ACOS, but I've finally read POD and it's extremely disappointing.The plot goes absolutely nowhere. The story switches abruptly between the various groups, with little connection between the plot threads. Absolutely nothing happens. Minor characters are described in painstaking detail -- but who cares? Men and women are described with simplistic caricatures. And there isn't a single interesting or memorable ""moment"" in POD."
3,Flawed but still fantastic,"I've enjoyed all the Wheel of Time books, but this one is just more of the same--which isn't all bad. The formula works.However, I am frustrated with the one-dimensional characters. Will Rand and the boys ever stop acting like thick-witted dolts when in the presence of women? Will the girls stop being smugly self-satisfied as (once again) they trick these lunkheads into doing their bidding?This series, good as it is, badly needs its boys and girls to grow up into men and women."
3,"Probably the worst book in the series, but not bad","The Wheel of Time had a a lot of momentum in the first 4 or 5 books, but 6-8 are slow-paced at best. Thats not necissarily a bad thing though. There were not really any dull moments that I could find, it's just that detail fills up so much of the book that the plot progresses slowly. If you like Jordan's characters, you will be interested enough to read through the book and find out what happens to them. Overall, its a decent book, just don't expect a whole lot to happen in it."
3,i was a little disappointed with this one.,I noticed that the margins were bigger and that the font was a couple of sizes bigger with this book. I got the impression Robert Jordan wasn't really into this book. I too was disappointed that Mat wasn't in this book. Path of Daggers was a pale shadow to the other seven books.
4,Still Waiting,"It is painful to read and still not get an ending after so many years, yet the series is great. This book is obviously trying to get to the end and gets a little lost but the reader ends up increasing his understanding of the characteres that will be needed in the end. Definitely, a great fanasty series that to get hooked on. Now its time for number 9."
3,Way past time to wrap this baby up!,"I first got hooked on the Wheel of Time series because it wasn't a straight good-and-evil, black-and-white fable. Everybody had an agenda, and parties that were nominally on the same side often worked at cross purposes. The plots unfolded swiftly, and the characters were so memorably drawn that they lingered in my consciousness.No longer.Now there are seemingly thousands of characters I can't keep up with, there's not much moving the story forward, and Jordan's writing has degenerated. He's still one of the better writers in fantasy today, but the flaws are many and obvious. Time for some characters to die and stay dead. Time for some current plot resolutions so we can build up to the big finale. And way, way, way past time to start Tarmon Gaidon."
2,The book stands only by support of the whole.,"Of course Robert hasn't lost his touch. Of course the series is the greatest ever. But ""halting"" is a very good way to describe this book. I can't help but feel that Robert should have waited until he could build some sort of resolution before publishing The Path of Daggers."
3,"Good, but...","I rushed to my local bookstore to buy Path of Daggers, and...it was a real disappointment. The characters and story all seem to be stuck in an endless holding pattern. The author barely mentions entire plots and some of the main characters, and spends most of the book on the least interesting storylines. I especially missed the humor of the other eight books. Path of Daggers said less in 591 pages than most of the other books did in half that. I sincerely hope that Mr. Jordan isn't running out of steam, or ideas."
2,A real page turner! I had to skip a lot just to stay awake!,"The only reason this book rates two stars is that it came into print at all, and I was beginning to doubt it would. Good writing and some interesting scenes but major sections of story going nowhere. If you just want to pretend you are really in this make-believe place, fine. But if you want to READ a good story, more progress please!"
2,I'm getting too old for this...,"...and so is Robert Jordan. I hope he dosen't expire of EXTREEM old age before finishing this series. If you look at this well written book carefully, nothing really new happened. My predictions for the next book: Elayne has trouble controlling Nynaeve and dosen't want to hurt Aviendha's feelings. Nynaeve moons over Lan and loses her temper with everybody else. Egwene continues to have trouble convincing everyone that she is the REAL Amyrlin Seat. Perrin searches for Faile without success. Faile learns humility. Rand fights himself and someone else to a draw. And Mat, Mat? Who's he??? I think that telling this story is going to take longer than the original events took. Please, Mr.Jordan, surprise us and give us some meaningful advances in the storyline. Tie up some of the loose ends, hopefully in less than two years!!!"
1,Jordan passes on his chance to be mentioned with Tolkien . .,"I understand that Robert Jordan has been offered a large amount of money to write each book. If so, this explains why the series is really going nowhere fast. I thought that the first and second books really put him in a position to be mentioned at the same time as JRR Tolkien -- a true master of the fantasy genre. Obviously, that is no longer the case. Whether from greed or a severe lack of creativity, Jordan has lost his touch. There are some good chapters, but overall this book is a serious disappointment. Lots of words, little resolution. At this rate, he'll be writing this series for another decade. If you must read it, don't buy it -- borrow it from the library."
1,A great disappointment from a great series fizzling out,"If the first books from the Wheel of Time could be visualized as an epic 70mm movie, this last offering is like a TV weekly episode. Poor on plot, character development and new ideas it is carrying through the same tired theme never ending one branch before sprouting two others. Hundreds of new names to digest with little involvement in the plot, whatever of that remains. Pity to see such great series being dragged on for the sake of continuing the exploitation of the loyal fans. I myself have taken this series one book too far. It ends here."
2,Jordan lost in the world of his own making,"With the first five books of this series Jordan created a rich and intriguing world with engaging and unique characters, so much so that many i know who've read them would stay up for nights in a row to find out what happens next. Gradually through the next two, and now in the last book it is very clear he is lost in this world. So lost that nothing really happened at all. In addition it feels like he wrote only half a book...where is the rest??? I can only hope that in the next book, he finds his place again. A good story always has a good ending, not one that drags on forever.I love this series but it's beginning to frustrate me so!!!"
5,Amazing,"Awesome book, each one is better than the last. By this point in the series Jordan has hit his stride and its really rolling with the story."
2,Even potentially good authors sometimes sell out,"Jordan's latest opus has proudly joined the ranks of the X-Files, Twin Peaks, David Eddings, Frank Herbert's Dune series, and others who inevitably milk something beyond it's worth. Any structure of a story from the beginning has be callously cast aside while character development has become both contrived and erratic."
1,"A barrage of names, unimportant charactors, pathetic.","I once enjoyed this series, when it had a decent pace, before it lost its direction. It was never a fast paced series, and was usually to descriptive with to little action. But this book has take these attributes to a new level. Jordan tries to introduce way to many new irrelavant charactors, expecting the reader to keep up. I could bash this book for hours but it's not worth my time. This book sucks and I won't buy another. But after reading 10000 pages I must see the end. Thank GOD for the library."
1,Sheer and utter disappointment,I remember one critic calling Jordan the next Tolkien. What a joke. The Wheel of Time started off with so much promise...what happened? All I know is that absolutely nothing happened in this book! The only way I'll pick up Book 9 is if Robert Jordan posts a letter of apology to fans on the Internet. It's the least that he could do.
4,Read the other 7 (again) first.,"I only read this one after having gone back and re-read the previous 7 books. Having done that, I like this one, MUCH BETTER THAN CoS. That one was BORING... but perhaps it was because I hadn't re-read the previous one and been so engrossed in the storyline?? I am a little disappointed in the lack of action as in the last few and wish A- the story line would pick up. B-Rand would learn ""laughter and tears"""
3,Another long wait...,"This book really feels like Jordan sqeezed out. It don't give much away at all. We get to know very little about Mat, and the chapters mainly is about side events. It seems like it is another long wait until I can read more about how Jordan plans to turn the Wheel of Time"
2,This book is NO FUN!,"This book is no fun because: 1) The characters regress, not progress 2) Despite the fact that Jordan has created umpteen characters, the first 25-30 pages are devoted to NEW characters, 3) Nothing of note happened in this book; 4) Mat, an interesting character, was not even mentioned. If his next book is this bad, or even close, I doubt I will buy another."
2,Forced to read,"Someone said no one is forcing us to read Robert Jordan. Well, Robert Jordan is forcing us to read. By giving us a feast of words and titilating our imagination he has much of the fantasy world hooked. We can't afford not to read for fear we may miss a plot line he has set up in the first set of books. Even after reading this book I am still waiting for those pay offs. And when the pay offs do come I can't remember the set up because it was years ago as well as many books ago.Thank God for the internet and the information we can turn to to review.As far as Path of Daggers is concerned, I enjoyed it, but was disappointed. It took well over one quarter of the book just to activate the silly bowl of winds and change weather from hot to cold. That should have been a chapter.I wish Jorden would stop milking us for all we are worth just because we had faith in him at one time. Talk about a god that failed!"
2,"Disappointing, no Matt, no action","Imagine my complete diappointment upon reading this book and finding Matt has been completely left out of it. In book 7 we are left with Matt getting caught up in the Seachan invasion and in book 8 not one word about his fate. The book concentrates primarily on the actions of the women. Unfortunately there is not much action, merely endless banter between the characters. This book could have been condensed into a hundred pages and would have been an improvement. It appears to me that Jordan is trying stretching himself too far in trying to give every character equal billing. At this pace, the series can be at least 20 volumes long. It is hard to believe that in 2 years time, this is the best that Jordan can do. This is easily the weakest book of the series. My advise is to borrow this book instead of buying it. Wait for book 9, you wont have missed much."
1,who's he kidding?,"We may as well put our money in an envelope and send it to him, and not waste our time anymore. Thats all he wants anyway. The series has ended for me. the women are so annoying, its obvious Jordan isn't targeting a female audience, and isn't that brat Faile dead yet? Someone needs to kill her off and teach the other females some manners. I don't know what Mrs. jordan is like, but REAL women aren't like that. the plot of PoD is slow and frustrating, and how the heck does anyone keep up with all these different characters? I loved Jordans first books so much, they've earned him one more chance, but he better start pulling a few things together. And please, get rid of the holier than thou female attitudes."
3,A lot of nothing.........,"Mr. Jordan takes us on a new weave of storylines but he dosen't do much in the over 600 pages of text. Granted, I have only read baout the first 2/3rds of the book but we don't even have a chapter with Rand until page 281. I don't know where he is going with this book, but you could have cut it in half and placed the first half of the book in ACOS and the last half in WInter's Heart instead of making this a separate text.I am going to continue the series because of what I have invested already timewise but I wish he would get on with it already."
1,It Was Really Bad,"Okay, can we say ""money making""? Because that's all RJ seems to be interested in. The series was pretty good until about the ummm, 5,000th page. The next, uhh, 2,000 pages were a little lacking in substance. Just end the d@mn thing! I think I'll just skim the rest of the books' endings in the store because they sure aren't worth my money."
2,Procrastination in Prose,"The first book was predictable, but most of this genre are so. The next two or three entries in the series were however quite good. Since the fourth book though, almost nothing of any interest has occurred. This book is a particularly egregious example of an author attempting to milk a concept for all its worth. If one waits almost two years between installments one would hope that something, anything, might actually occur in the latest entry. No such luck. I have never come across a series where main characters disappear for entire books. Is the author being paid by the word? Or is he more caught up these days in ""being"" a famous writer than actually writing famously?"
1,Zero stars...what happened in this one?,"I read this when it first came out, hoping Jordan had finally decided to tell a story again. I was disappointed. I honestly don't remember what happened any longer, except for the Bowl of the Winds thing. Yeah, that's good writing. I'll stick to Robin Hobb, Martin, Glen Cook & The Black Company, and a host of other GOOD writers who can tell a story."
4,Could be worse,"Although I agree that ""The Path of Daggars"" was a little slow, I think that it was laying an important foundation to come. In a saga this huge, you cannot expect everything to be utterly perfect. Exercise a little discipline for heaven's sake. Jordan is not through yet. I do not doubt that what comes next will be as breathtaking as anything that came before. I, for one, am nowhere near ready to throw in the towel. Since Mr. Jordan is willing to put in the vast amount of effort needed to make this series come to life (and it does), I am willing to put up with whatever framework he considers essential to completing the story. Once the series is finished, I have no doubt that all the information presented in these two books about which so many people complain will be used to the utmost. Remember that with Jordan, no detail is insignificant, no matter what it may seem to be at the time. By the way, does anyone have any idea when book 9 will be released or what the title will be?"
2,"This series should be called ""Stalling for Time""","Take a review from someone who has READ the book.I'll admit, I pre-ordered the book about 3 months before it came out, anticipating a wonderful sequel. I was quite disappointed when I read this book. This book was book 8 in ""The Waste of Time"". If you're looking for a Fantasy Series to read, avoid this one until Jordan figures out how to finish a series.Only a handful of new events took place in this book. The remaining 450 pages were merely rehasing of old events that have been with us for the past few books. I agree with a previous review, which said that the past 3 books could have been compressed into one book, with no loss of storyline.All-In-All, it was a decent book, but not worth the money, or time that I have waited for it. If you're not patient, don't read this series. It's on year 8, and doesn't look like it's going to finish for at least another 4 years."
4,"Very good, But where's the rest of the book.","I am rabid fan of this ""wheel of Time"" books.It seems the books are sliding down the ""meat to fluff"" sclale. The last two (in my humble oppinion) could have made one of the previous books and still not stood on it's own. I still eagerly await #9. P.S. WHERE'S MATT!!!"
2,Loosing Interest fast - Please save me,"Dear Mr. Jordan, you are losing me fast. I have gone from your most advocate reader to a person that will passingly consider your next volume of STUFF. Whatever happened to the fast-paced nail bitting story built and told during the first three volumes and the now ridiculos pages and pages of banter and chatter amoung the characters ? If you are bored, then please knock out the SET, complete the story within two volumes, finish them over the next 18 months, and then we can all get on with our lives.You might consider a project that interests you after you complete the one that seems to so disinterest you now!!! Please don't lose me... My heart beckons to return to the EARLY WOT!"
1,well once again nothing happens,"I assume that Robert Jordan has somed pretty serious personal expenses. That is the only reason I can fathom for this excrescence of a book. Nothing happens!! We have one battle that is not fully described. We have one loosing of the winds that appears to bring destruction to the world, with no explanation of why. We have one asassination attempt of Rand by some emasculated saidan chanellors. Net.... We spend about a thousand pages trying to figure out why Rand cannot be a man. Most of the book is spent with various types of women in various types of duress or triumph. This author has been compared to JRR.Tolkein. What a joke. Tolkein at least mangaged to get the story done in three books (not including the hobbit)END"
1,Read the reviews!,"Like many, I read WOT 1 to 7 and eagerly anticipated book 8. But enough is enough! I stopped at page 306, promptly forgot about it (read KSR's Mars series instead .. good job, KIM!) and then picked it up again, only to stop after another 10 pages. Good grief! NOTHING HAPPENS! Its supposed to be a STORY, Bob! In a STORY, THINGS happen! Think MOVIE, not (excruciatingly detailed) PHOTO.The most pleasure I got out of this book was reading the hundreds of reviews posted here (some of these REALLY cracked me up!) I really recommend 'em!HAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!"
2,the wait will be the death of this series,There is simply to much time between books in this series. The series as a whole is my favorite but I hate to wait 2+ years per book (the main reason for the low rating)This book was slow but still good. nothing really new happens and like some of the other books not all the main charcters are there. However still a good read for most WoT fans.
2,"Get on with it, RJ!","I feel disappointed that Robert Jordan hasn't been able to make this book up to those standards that he has advocated in the past. The Path of Daggers suggests that he has lost his focus on the storyline, because the emphasis is on human relation and talk. I don't mean that this is a bad thing in itself, but when nothing happens and the same things are repeated over and over again, it just loses momentum. The epic story that RJ is telling deserves a more balanced approach on action and human interest. The series is, surely, one of the best that I've ever read, but this chapter is the low point(hopefully). I hope that RJ will pull his story together in the next episodes, or else the series will end far short of the promise it gives."
4,"Getting frustrated, still hooked.","Yes, this book does not live up to Jordans earlier books,(like 1 - 5) but then again this is no ordinary series. I was realy bored with the bogged down female on female interplay. And I am so sick of the Perrin's I AM NOT A LORD! crap I could die. Thankfully, that may be over. And what is wrong with with sleeping with three women Rand? Like he is going to live long enough to have to deal with it? Please Robert Jordan, enough with the byplay, there is so much left unanswered, you could write a dozen more book still. Let the character building lag. I waited almost two years for very little reward."
5,Awesome nothing else cuts it,This book is just spectacular. I've never read anything like it. The intriuge and plot twists make this one of the best of the series. But it involves many elements that a hardcore Jordan fan would not apreiciate. If you have not read the others in the series first it will completly boggle you. It is one of the harder ones in the series to understand but the novel is amazing. Read the whole series it is the best series ever in my opinion.
1,Read the amazon review;that should cover it,After reading COS I just decided to read the amazon reviews and summaries and skip the book all together. COS and LOC dragged on so much that I'm moving on to something else. One specific comment-ditch nynaeve.
3,"Enjoyable, yet starting to be like a Dickens book - TOO MUCH","While the book was thoroughly enjoyable in the continuing epic of the Wheel of Time, Jordan opens many doors and continues to open doors without first resolving some of the early conflicts. The leaping and bounding around the various groups in the world is starting to become over whelming, cumbersome, and uninteresting. Jordan had best unite some of those side plots into one soon or the reader's gonna be ""lost in space""... Who's the main character again? *grin* Come on Jordan... get with the program! Don't have to end it - but consolodate some of those plots! We want to focus on the ta'verens...My 2 cents, -Cal"
2,A Disappointing Addition to a Great Saga,"This book was a big disappointment. Unfortunately, Books Seven and Eight of the Wheel of Time have been the weakest entries in the series. What's worse is that the waits between books have been getting longer. Which means that the momentum that had been building up through the first six books has slowly faded away. The only silver lining for Wheel of Time fans is that this book ends with promise. If Jordan can't deliver the goods in Book Nine, it will be clear that his reach exceeded his grasp. Fans expect more after such a long build-up than countless pages describing a trip to a farm, or women squabbling like hens. Give us something to get excited about RJ! This just ain't gonna cut it!"
1,This series could have been one of the greats.,"I loved the first four books of this series. I was completely enthralled by the imagination of Robert Jordan. Now, I feel let down by the author. This series is going nowhere. The sad thing is that I will probably buy the next one and the next one and so on. If there are any new readers out there thinking about reading this series, I would say prepare to be amazed for a few books and progressively discouraged with every successive volume. The only possible reason for dragging out this series is money. Maybe in about ten years if this series is over by then someone will condense this series down to a big great volume and future generations will be spared some of the meaningless garbage that has so littered the last two books. Very bad Robert Jordan! Bad! Now you go and think about what you've done!"
1,Terrible reason to kill a tree,"I was very disappointed in this installment of the series. I don't have time to wade through so much detail of so little importance. Mr. Jordan should re-read his first 4 or 5 books and note what he has obviously forgotten. Good characters and plot lines bring in readers, detail does not. If I want the type of detail he provides, I'll read the dictionary."
4,Hang in there Robert,I' know your books are sagging but just put a little more effort in to it. you shouldn't leave out a character like Mat. Try and put back the spunk in the characters. call me if you have a problem.
1,The 600 page vacuum,"The intriguing world of the first several novels has deteriorated into noisy office politics punctuated with troubling fetish-like mental fugues replete with spankings, silly empty threats of skinning people alive, and throughout the S&M world of the Seanchan lives in the background. From my POV, Jordan is free to dream of his sexless bondage fantasies, but I sure don't want to read the result when they print through onto paper."
2,Blah. Very blah.,"First thing: the synopsis and dust-jacket blurb have very close to nothing at all to do with Path of Daggers. Second: c'mon RJ, this epidemic of chronic stupidity among characters who used to be fascinating is disgusting. Third: Hello? The book just STOPPED out of nowhere. That's not a ""cliffhanger ending"", that's an UNFINISHED MANUSCRIPT. Fourth: No tension, unless you count ""You're a bully!"" ""No you're a bully!"" YOU BULLY!"" from the civilized women, with ""Oh dear, what color goes with my eyes?"" from the oh-so-fierce Aiel. Fifth? It's not the world that's falling apart under the Dark One's touch -It's this series that is falling apart. If the next one is this abominably wretched, I for one am finished with the series. These last two books have been well below the level of the other novels. Buy it if you have faith in the series, but don't get your hopes up. It wasn't worth the wait."
1,Loosing the grip!,"Unfortunately this book is not in any ways as good as the first 5 or 6 books. It's going downwards! I do wonder if Mr Jordan is just writing his books to earn more money or if he really has a good idea of his own story. I hope the next (last) will be much better then this one.It's easy to see a pattern among fantasyauthors: they write long stories with less and less content, the longer the story goes. And my question is: when will the last in this bookserie come?"
2,Robert Jordan's Winning Streak Ends With #7,"Robert Jordan, one of today's best fantasy writers, has lost his first battle with his recent release of ""The Path of Daggers"". This current book lacks any of the colorful story telling of the previous seven books. The fact that he does not even include Matt should clue you into the incompleteness of this book.Lets just hope that he will try and make up for this poor effort in the next book."
2,An OK book.,"I found ""A Path Of Daggers"" to be tedious, and not worthy of being published. If the quality of book 1 was like this, there would not have been this terrible fervor over Robert Jordan's books. The only reason I finished this book is that books one through six were very good, and book seven was fair. Also I would like to see the story to the end. But if Robert Jordan keeps writing the way he has, it will take another 28 books to finish the story."
2,Disappointment,"Robert Jordon has a gift for describing people and places with such great detail that one feels as if they were walking with his characters. This book, however goes overboard in this. You get all this great detail about things, but the plot's entire progress suffers due to it. I was excited throughout all of his other books, but this one made me wonder why I spent my money on it."
2,Oh what a tangled web we weave,"Though well written and well detailed, Robert Jordan lost his magical touch he had in the first six novels. Jordan' problems are that he creates too many plots and charaters without following through and he does not want to let go. His storyline his now so scrattered, that as a reader, I can't see how he can bring it(plots and characters) all together in the next novel. If the next novel is as ""The path of daggers"" in the end, he'll not only lose Rand at Shayol Ghul, he'll lose his faithful fans as well. Can the Dragon be reborn in his next novel? I do hope so."
2,From the Dragon Mount Peak to the depths of Shayol Ghul!,"Let me start by saying I'm not even a third of the way through the book, and I'm not surprised to see the many dissapointments of the readers here at Amazon.com. Although P of Daggers is longer than A Crown of Swords, length refers to more agony in this case. I was up till 2 am, longing for some action! Jordan was pumping these out a year apart with more and more excitement. I used to think that Feist's Magician series was the finest I'd read, until I was introduced to the Eye of the World. But now, I look back, and at least see closure with A Darkness at Sethanon, in 4 books. Mr. Jordan, if you're looking, please listen to these avid fans."
1,Like getting underwear from Santa Claus,"I've waited for Path of Daggers like my 3 year waits for Santa Claus at Christmas. All I can say is reading this book is as exciting as getting underwear for Christmas. I wonder how many more filler books Jordan plans to write before he gets back to the story. I know he's keen on history - Path of Daggers is the parallel to Moses wandering the wilderness for 40 years - nothing happens until Joshua comes along. Will the promised land be book 9, 10,11, 12, or ????"
3,UGH!,"Robert Jordan is easily the best fantasy writer and I love his books but.......... this one well, sucked! Jordan dragged out everything, there were to many fine points and he didnt even mention Mat (my personal favorite) I guess you gotta read it just cause it is the 8 book, but i guess i expected to muchOH WELL!!!"
2,"First volume in the WoT ""Slump"" Trilogy","The Path of Daggers is the first volume in what I consider to be the three-volume Wheel of Time ""slump trilogy"" -- that is to say, the three volumes of the series where nothing of particular importance happens. Events set up in this novel will not be resolved until Knife of Dreams, which means that readers are in for a very long wait. Outside of a resolution to the Bowl of Winds arc, there is very little to report on here. Rand and his army take on the Seanchan, but the outcome is not as epic as one might expect. Perrin sets out to deal with The Prophet, but ends up running into the Shaido Aiel. And Egwene inches ever onward towards Tar Valon.My recommendation: skim this volume in the series."
1,You will abandon...,"after reading this boring drivel, i've decided to abandon this never-ending soap opera of a series."
3,A little resolution now and then would be nice.,"I've been an ardent Jordan fan since I began reading this series. I picked up book 8 and tried desperately to like it, but the fact is... I'm no longer convinced that Jordan is going anywhere with this. We're left with hundreds of pages worth of our favorite characters standing around. To make matters worse, Jordan seems determined to keep throwing minor characters at us left and right till we can't tell our Aiel clan chiefs from our Tearen Highlords. Forget the minor characters and the tedious exposition; it's time for Jordan to start resolving his plethora of subplots or start losing fans."
1,Jordan Milks His Cash Cow,"Okay, so I was a big fan of TWOT series in the beginning, but the books have hit a new low. Whatever respect I had for Robert Jordan as an author (and his first few books in the series were very, very good) is long gone. He keeps stretching out this series more and more, and less and less happens in each book, culminating in this *painful* read for the 8th installment.Needless to say I won't be buying any of the later volumes..."
4,It is not as bad as everyone thinks.,Robert Jordan had run out of enthralling plot lines and stories. This book was written to set up some new ones. It is a setup. I believe the next one will move along like the first six did. I just hope that all three of the Two Rivers' boys are involved. There is always a gap when one is left out of the storyline.
2,"Please, get on with it.....","The last 2 books have been frustrating to say the least. I wade through tedious and uneventful situations to be rewarded with brief but brilliant sections that have me glued to the pages. RJ seems to either be searching for a decent conclusion to the WOT or milking it for all it's worth. As far as I'm concerned, you could have made this book 200 pages by just including the stuff that really advances the story. Part of RJ's talent is in character development but I REALLY don't need to read about Nynaeve tugging her braid anymore.So why am I eagerly awaiting #9?? Sucker for punishment, I guess."
2,Path of Daggers; Jordan's walking it with this one,"This book was just enough to drive me insane with questions about what happened to Mat, the sole reason I bought the book was to see mats fate with the seanchan, he's my favorite character and I think the book missed something without him. Jordan is a good writer but he's moving to slow. The book, the way it's going couldn't possibly be ended with any less than five more books. And is Rand going to go crazy or cleanse Saidin, becuase the way he's going he'll kill himself and everyone around him before Tarmon Gaidon ever comes, and Morainne, will she return when the horn blows or is she stuck in that wish world with Lanfear? good story but taking tooooooooooo Long"
2,"Sorry, but it wasn't worth the wait.","I am probably one of the most obsessed fans of the Wheel of Time series that there is. I've read the first six books seven times each! Even so I have to say that with Path of Daggers, Jordan blew it.Jordan spends far too much time leading up to events and not finishing them! For every mystery resolved there are 10 more new ones. The whole book only covers about 11 days! And (this was my biggest gripe against this book) WHERE THE **** IS MAT??? JORDAN JUST LEFT HIM BURIED UNDER SOME WALL IN ... well, those who have read aCoS know what I'm talking about... I don't want to tell too much for those who haven't.Book nine promises to be chock full of plot and action (but then again I thought the same of book 8 when I put down Crown on Swords). So if you haven't started the series, wait until it's complete. If you have, you're hooked, so buy it and suffer the wait along with the rest of us."
3,Another filler book,"It seems that this most recent installment of the Wheel of Time lacks the zeal of the earlier books. The Path of Daggers feels like a filler book, like Mr. Jordan used the entire book to set up his next. If this is true then the next book will be outstanding. One must not, however, pass up this book becuase it is still well written, just an ending would be nice soon."
1,"quit milking it, RJ",I am getting sick of waiting for nothing. Finish the thing already. You just wrote a 600 page prologue.
3,Spinning the Wheel of Time,"The...uhh, what book are we on now? Oh yeah, 8th book of this series was an unmemorable experience. With the exception of the conclusion of the Bowl of Winds sub-plot being wrapped up, nothing much else has advanced. I think I, along with a large number of fans of this series are getting to the end of our ropes with the contiuned descriptions of skirt smoothings, sniffs, increasinging levels of Toh, and all the other minutia that are, as usual, described in much detail. While I can't say that POD was all bad, I find myself ready for this series to end, which means I can't rank it up there with the best of all time due to the fact that other series (Chronicles of Amber, for one) have kept me begging for more through their entirity. So lets put a wrap on this one Mr. Jordan, or at least spend less than 1000 pages advancing the story about 3 months."
3,"Now I am ready to read the book, BUT WHERE IS IT.",This book is just one long prelogue. The story lines do not progress at anywhere near the rate I expected. Jordan accomplished more in 100 pages in the first book then he did in all 600 pages of this one. If I was not hooked on the story I would not read anymore books from this author.
2,Worst book of the series,"This book literally made be stop reading the series. I did not pick it back up again for eight years, and can clearly see why I stopped on this one. There is no clear line of events in this story, it completely skips over continuing the most important events from the previous book, and has no climax, of any sort, at its end. The enemies are not clearly fleshed out, and when they do appear, you are left wondering what the heck they were doing before, because they just suddenly appear in the story out of nowhere.I am hoping this series picks up in the later books, because this is a far cry from the early books in the series."
3,worth waiting,"i know that this one was slow and continues to never get to the climax, but i have faith that it will pick up in the end and give us the former excitement and movement of the first four wonderful books (which are sooooo....good)But for me, anyway, i will stick it out and continue to love the characters, well...all but Nynaeve. And where the hell is Matrim! I love that guy! Make sure and read A Game of Thrones while waiting for book #9."
1,boring,"Are you ever going to finish this story? The first 3 or 4 books in this set are pretty good. But the last few,,,. How long is it going to take to finish this yarn, or yawn. I waited very patently for this one to come out, hoping this would be the last one, or at least a little more to than the last one. But no such luck. I will give it one more book to finish this tale, or I aint going to buy no more. I think Jordan is dragging this out for the money now and has lost sight of the story."
1,Wall-denting speed record.,"I didn't even make it past the prologue of this book before it went flying toward my wall. Jordan's detailed descriptions have deteriorated into endless infodumps without relevance to the central story. One minor character looking at a group of other minor characters produces paragraphs of mind-bogglingly unnecessary factoids about each one.I pulled the book back out of my wall later on and randomly flipped through, only to see more of the same wretched wallowing in plotless ""ambience"". I give up.Incidentally, to answer those RJ fans who say that only other best-selling authors are qualified to criticize his books, I say you don't have to be able to lay an egg to tell if it's rotten."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Okay, this one put me to sleep and there's only a few weeks more to wait for #9. The cover is bad as usual, with this hobbit-like creature tramping through the snow. We are told it is Perrin, and at long last proof that Jordan's been putting us all on. Perrin is so often described as having shoulders so wide they make him appear shorter, but there's certainly no evidence in the pic of this little dude on the cover. Check it: Ogiers are 10' tall, but a foot in WOT is ten inches. So, that makes the average male Ogier 8'4"" or so, and since we are CONSTANTLY told they stand at least half as tall again as the tallest male Aiel...this makes a tall Aiel 5'6"" or thereabouts. Rand is therefore about 5'2"" or 5'3"", and Perrin and Mat well under five feet tall. Hobbits. Tall hobbits to be sure, but hobbits nonetheless."
2,Why Bother?,"After a few hundred pages of this one I just got fed up. More mysterous intrigue, more ominous comments by mysterious strangers, more angst-filled nights for the main characters. Why does everyone think I am tupping her? Should I? Will my love be saved from her mysterious captors? Is my closest childhood friend really black (and blue) ahdj? Is there a plot to this series? What ever happened to baby Jane?Give up on it and go find an author who can tell a story in 300 pages."
2,Nodding off!,"When my brother brought the first Wheel of Time home way back, the entire bookworm family had a great time. The next few books were equally good. Somewhere along the line the WOT lost my mum, 2 sisters and slowly loosing the last two diehards. My brother now only reads WOT when someone else buys it.I used to re-read the entire series to date whenever a new title was released - about once a year. Re-reading Book 7 & 8 last took almost a month each - compared to an average 3 nites for a new book and a week for re-read."
2,More like a Dagger in the back.,"I have now made myself read all eight of Jordon's enormous books and still have not found one character I can say I truly care about. What even surprises me more is the great reviews he has gotten in the past as well as the comparison's to Tolkien which are a complete travesty to the fantasy genre. The only thing that has kept me reading his books is the wonderfull concepts and great description that Jordon applies to each book. If he had characters with more depth then I could honestly say this series was a classic but sadly he has written another flat book in a tiring series. I would recommend anyone looking to see what real characters are like, combined with great ideas and description to check out George R.R. Martin's, A Song of Ice and Fire, which is the best series of the decade and the only fantasy series I would even mention in the same breath as J.R.R Tolkien."
1,Yada-Yada-Yada,"PoD is a book about ""nothing"", ""not that there's anything wrong with that"" (apologies to Seinfeld). The first 4 WoT books were riveting but unfortunately it's been an agonizing down-hill slide ever since. This is the first epic I've read where I'm actually considering bailing out at this point. At best, I won't be buying ""Book 9"" until I've read the reviews and it's in paperback! R.J. let's try to get some focus back into this series and bring it to a clever, exciting conclusion."
2,Yawn,"Who are all these people? I forgot. I've read this entire series twice, and by the time I get to Path of Daggers, I've already forgotten who everybody is. Most people don't even make it past Fires of Heaven, the legendary ""most boring book in the entire series."" The man's descriptions and syntax are disturbingly akward for an author who has put out eight books. Jordan's got me ""chasing the Dragon"", so to speak, and I must read on to the end, but please, god, let the end be soon."
4,A Gripping Fireside Tale,"To start I must state that Jordan is at best a poor writer, there are many awkward sentences and some very redundant descriptions. If that doesn't bother you, you may very well think (as I do) that Jordan is a MASTERFULL storyteller. This series is involved, gripping, and seems truer to real life than any other fantasy series I have ever read. Jordan's characters practically spring from the pages. His understanding of human nature and the realities of power and conflict are astounding."
4,Imagination,"I've been browsing through the different reviews, and there in something that strikes me as weird. Not many people talk about how the book makes your imagination fly and the very intersting conversations it creates with other fans. It's true that the book in itself is a bit slow, but anyway, read it. And it's much more interesting to talk about the series than all those boring conversations about politcs economics and so on. I think that the structure is very complex and it's all the best that every interpretation is possible. Don't you just wait for the story to be served to you, try to imagine it in advance, the book will be all the more interesting."
3,For the FIRST time in this series -- Not worth the wait,"I've loved this series from the start---I've read most of the books a couple of times. Jordan's imagination and skills in storytelling are incredible.This time I think he got carried away in describing the finer points. For example, I am used to learning a lot about of who was wearing what in this series. This time around I feel as though we made more progress in this area than in plot line."
4,"One down, more to go (but where's Mat?)","I'm thinking of writing a book called ""Everything I Need to Know about Power Politics I Learned From the Wheel Of Time"". I'm wondering if Robert Jordan wasn't Special Forces, considering some of the strategies & tactics he suggests, especially for the Aiel. The books are entertaining, but a little longer than they need to be (I find myself skimming and it doesn't matter) and the prose is not first-rate, but it's not bad. Overall, a very addictive read."
4,The Sorrow of Pain,"I have read secaral reviews of this book, and have discussed it at length with my friends, Jordan fans all of them. What no one has seemed to realize yet is that this book is intentionally hard to read. The point of this book is the pain of the characters. It is about pain, loss, and sorrow. I felt my gut wrench when Rand gave the wine to Fedwin; "" A little something in the wine"". This is why Mat wasn't in the book. Mat isn't a grief stricken character, and wouldn't fit well at all, being a more good time type. If Mat had been in this book, he would have spent the entire time drunk."
1,"...people, listen up.","you're suppose to be writing a review of this book, not the entire series. the first couple books in the series were great, but that doesnt change the fact that this was an aweful book. yes, the series overall is quite good, though in a downward spiral. don't give this book undue praise just because it is part of a good series. review it for what it is, not for what it's part of."
4,Good novel building the plot,"There have been a lot of relatively poor reviews for this book most of which are related to the length of the series and the tedious nature of the plot. The point is that this is a huge series and a book like this was necessary to bring some of the plotlines together. There is really little point in reading this book without reading the rest of the series first , and for those who think the whole series too long yes its hateful having to wait a year for the next part of the story but i also would like to see most of the plotlines concluded in some fashion and the only way this is going to happen is with 3 - 5 more books. Also if its that annoying then its obviously worth waiting for."
2,Definately the weakest in the series,"I looked forward to this but as much as I wanted to love this book- i just couldn't. As we've been seeing with the last few books too so many incredible characters it is like reading 5-9 books- and confusing! Jordon barely even touches on a few characters/topics that were so important in previous books. Plus nothing major happens! I hope the next book starts to tie up some of the sub plots so we can start focusing on a big finale. If number 9 doesn't do that, walk away."
2,Bought it...read it...filed it...bummed about it.,"I look forward to all of Jordan's volumes in this series, but I must say that this is his ""Search for Spock."" Nothing much happens and what does happen is a yawner. Really wish I'd waited for the paperback and saved some bucks. I hope the next one is more in keeping with the pace and style we have learned to expect. Oh well..."
2,who wrote this book???,Robert Jordan couldn't have written the Path of Daggers because this book sucked it took 3 weeks to read I read the other 7 in 1 month. please have the characters actually acomplish something in the next book suspense and action might be nice anything is better than the 28$ of nothing that I bought
2,"Love the characters, hate the soap opera...","I will admit that I am a Jordan junkie, and will faithfully go out and purchase number nine whenever it manages to make it to the shelves. For over a year I waited ever so patiently for the eight installment in this fantasy monolith and when I had returned to my comfortable sitting room with a bottle of wine and a full pack of smokes to lose myself in the world that Jordon had masterfully crafted in his first few works I was painfully dissapointed. Over a year of making excuses for Jordan's sluggish writing in volumes six and seven and the eigth provides nothing more than pulp fiction. Sure I love the characters and read on to continue to spend time with them, but I was expecting a little more than 900 page taster of events to come. I hope the ninth volume will vindicate my faith and hope in Mr. Jordon and the editors at Tor."
2,Getting Predictable,"The first few books were excellent (4 or more stars). Since then, the series has become irritating. Only a few science fiction stories have become a legend, Lord of Rings, Star Wars and Blade Runner just to name a few of the best. Robert Jordan should save himself and end the series with no more than two more books. It's been so long since I read book eight I forget about the series until I came accross this Web site. I'm not sure I want to read the next book. I'll have to wait and see how nice the cover looks."
3,"OUCH, QUIT IT!!","Please, Mr. Jordan, give it a rest. After now the third book of nothing much happening please return to a more active plot. You can always go back and write a romance series later. You have set up enough subplots to last for several more books without having to tread water further, especially the tiresome Faile-Perrin ""hardships"". I too love my wife, have been married only several years, and still don't understand her completely. I hope I never do. The weather problems are getting old as well - there seem to be an abundance of old apples and turnips. When they run out will Perrin/Faile starve (If not, how about Cadsuane the SuperSedai?) - PLEASE???!!! Will the Seafolk ever be good for anything useful again? For my, and I'm sure many other faithful WOTists, sake - GET ON WITH IT!!"
2,Get back on track!,"When I read the first 4 books in the series, I realized that Robert Jordan is the best writer ever! But after that, each of the books has gotten worse, and finally, Path of Daggers is the worst of the bunch. In this book, Robert Jordan realized that anything with his name on it would be a bestseller, so he wrote a bunch of garbage and put it on the shelf, but he made the ending a cliffhanger so that we would buy the next book he writes! Unless Robert Jordan starts writing again instead of just trying to make a bunch of money, his readers will stop buying his books.-Luke Janes"
3,"good, but not as good as the others","The Path of Daggers was excellent compared to any other fantasy writing but the other Wheel of Time books. However, this book was far less interesting and engrossing that the others in the series, even ACoS, which I was sure was going to be the low point of the saga. No mention of Mat was a big disappointment, but we do learn about Moridin a little more. Still no unveiling of major secrets, such as where is Demandred and who killed Asmodean and is Moiraine alive, but I guess we'll just have to be patient."
1,"more story, less spanking","I wish Robert Jordan would work out his obsession with women spanking each other in some other venue. I am tired of reading repetitious fetishistic descriptions of female ""discipline."" I'm also disappointed that the characters that once were so interesting have become so boring, petty, and flat, and that the pace of the series has become so excruciatingly slow."
2,Somewhat Tedious,"This is a very fantastic series, but this book will put to you to sleep. The characters continue to add up which makes it next to impossible to figure out who's who in the field of secondary characters. Jordan continues to supply us with an over-abundance of extraneous information. This book is a must if you are a diehard fan. If you start out with book 8, you will be totally lost."
1,The Afterword confuses the previous 600 pages of reading!!,"I trudged through this book and at about halfway I put it down and wondered what the hell was happening with Mat. At that point I found out who was to be Nae'blis, something revealed by Jordan in 10 pages after we saw all the careful scheming by each person for the title. Also at that point nothing concerning the White Tower or the Seanchan really happened. So I dutifully read the next 300 pages and at the end wondered why I even bothered. The last page tells us we don't know what we read in the entire book!! The only reason this reviewer is not giving a rating of no stars is because it is not an option."
2,Not worth the wait,"Since reading the first book of this series, my life has changed dramatically. Now with a family and bigger career, there is not enough time to be wasted reading this much fluff. Mr. Jordan, please get to the point. Your core fans will have outgrown this series before you wrap it up. You'll need good recomendations to get new readers. Let's see if you can make it hapen."
1,crap! crap! crap! crap!(Am i being redundant?),"Then you get the gist of this book. This book is like a sleeping pill. I tried to keep myself awake reading it but failed miserably. It's a book about nothing, plain and simple. I couldn't wait for it to be over..."
1,never got beyond customer reviews,"I, like others, have been anxiously waiting for this book to come out. But after reading the reviews from fellow fans ... thank goodness I did not listen to ""Critics"" ... I think I will pass on this latest from RJ. Thank you Amazon.com for giving us this forum for reviews."
2,book is ok but series is overlong,the series has been a good one but enough is enough. it is time to wrap the series up and put it to bed. too many words withouth anything happening. get on and get finished with it robert!
2,Waaaaiiiitttt A second....,"Ok, this book was dull. Dull and repetitive for 800 some odd pages. But one question... is it just me or did anyone else notice the large amount of PMS the Aies-Sedai have?"
3,The worst book yet. Did the publisher stop him in mid-book?,"This book was chaotic and disjointed. Why were the Egwene and Elayne storylines so abruptly ended? No Matt at all and the forsaken glimpses seemed to be added as an afterthought. I'm convinced RJ was writing an 900 page book and the publisher said after 500pg ""That's it! We don't care if it's done, you have 2 weeks and it's final"""
3,Not as good as the others,"Jordan don't ever read Goodkinds work as one critic said, Soul of the Fire was so bad that it made PoD look good. Goodkinds series in going down hill after the first two books. PoD had little action, the plot moved very slowly and I can't stand the girls complaining. Jordan should conclude a novel with more answers given than question raised or he'll never finish the series. First six books of this series were great, either book 6 or 4 being most people's favourites. Jordan please get back on track in book#9, whatever it takes give some answers, have more action and pick up the pace."
1,Do not start this series!!,"This is a very bad book, but my main message is to tell people to not start the series. I'll reserve judgment on the series until its completed, but it is painful reading it at its current rate and pace.However, I do disagree with many of the negative reviews. I think that a lot happens in this book and it does move the plot along. It just does so very poorly. I find it harder and harder to care about the characters or what happens to them. The plot moves along without development or tension. Gone are the hints and foreshadowing that kept you guessing about future developments. Most of the text is simply filler. He desparately needs a decent editor."
1,A waste of my time.,"I first picked up on this series when visiting America early this decade and, along with family and friends, have followed it ever since. I have now had enough and wont bother with it anymore. Don't authors work with editors anymore? Somebody needs to tell Jordan that what initially interested his readers was the way his characters were forcefully drawn in an intricate and well developed plot.This book has boring characters and no evidence of a plot. Goodbye!!"
3,The next one has to be better!,It was just horrible. The book wasn't inter-woven at all. Where was Matt the whole book. The book only tied up loose ends it didn't further along the series.
1,"Let's admit it, Jordan's lost it","I think it is about time that his fan's recognized that Jordan has no idea where this series is going. The first four books were fast moving, creative, and truly epic in scope. In the last four he has spent something like 4,000 pages to advance the plot and character development about as far as he did in one of his first four volumes. Who has the time (and money) to keep Jordan floundering around until he finally decides to wind it up? I sure don't , not when George R. R. Martin and Jack Vance are available instead. Seriously, when reviewers are praising this book because they were able to skip the two previous ones and still understand everything, you know the series is in deep, deep trouble."
1,Wow... those poor trees that had to die for this,"I have given up reading this series. I have been encouraged by many of the intelligent reviews written about this series. But to those who are still fans of Mr. Jordan, the art of writing also has an aspect called knowing when to finish a tale. And this series should have ended at about Book 6 at the most. ""Oh, it's just a transition book, wait til Book 9"". No no... We've been waiting since Book 5 and NOTHING has happened.I have to agree with the HILARIOUS review written by one person who said that Mr. Jordan is most definitely dead. He probably died around Book 5, but since this series was bringing in such money, the publishers brought in other authors to write the series, never actually planning on finishing it. This is the only argument that makes sense. No one can write such bad books; it's a sin against all the trees that it has killed in its 5000 pages.Read George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones. Now there's a book."
2,Very boring!!!!,"This was almost as bad as The crown of swords. Why is Rand in one book almost Omnipotent, then in the next he is terrified of Cadsuane?? Sucks, JR make up your mind who Rand is!!! I'm tired of everyone's personality suddenly taking a detour or worse, regressing!! This book sucked, I don't want to read anymore WOT. Finish it up and be done with it. The first 5 books were good, after that it went to hell."
3,YOUR MOVE ISN'T THAT MOVING,"I have been a fan of AMERICA throughout their 30+ years of recording, so I was rather disappointed with YOUR MOVE.America's best albums were those under George Martin's expert production. Russ Ballard's production skills aren't quite as polished. Also, the songs on this collection aren't as well-crafted and aren't as memorable. While the intricate harmonies are evidenced, the arrangements lack imagination and inventiveness. The title track is the best of the lot, harkening back to their earlier material.America has done some very good albums...YOUR MOVE is merely okay."
5,The experience of a lifetime,"This hypnotic, mesmerizing series of books will forever change you and your perception of the world. I can only call their effect on me cataclysmic;- whole passages, evocative and unforgettable, are effortlessly committed to memory. One enters into the city of Alexandria, and walks its streets, the scents, the sounds, the sights a panorama of emotion. I have never before or since delved into fictional characters to the point where I honestly believed them real, so flawed, so intense is their portrayal. I envy the reader opening the covers of Justine for the first time. It is the beginning of a journey that will remain with you always."
3,Impressive prose marred by defective sociology,"I read Justine, the first of the Quartet, and was initially very taken with Durrell's great facility in sketching emotional landscapes, and an almost mesmerizingly poetic prose style. Unfortunately, the book is marred by quite a few blatantly racist descriptions, of black people in particular; I'll spare you the details. Surprising in a book written past the half-century mark (published in 1957, I believe) and purportedly about an ultra-cosmopolitan city.The other problem I had was the complete implausibility of most of the dialogue; it was as if Durrell didn't know how to make his characters distinct from the narrator's own sensibility; they all talk like master prose stylists with ultra philosophical and literary bents. Some may say this was intentional stylization, but if so, it works against the book."
5,Excellent Prose and Exceptional Plot,"Durrell is an incredible writer who is masterful at setting moods, both through his imagery and the use of his character's psyches. That being said, these books are a true pleasure to read. The plot threads are a melange of romance, politics, intrigue, but everything blends together to become a superb statement about the quality of all human experiences. Even though Durrell spent much of his life outside of the Western world, his descriptions of an Islamic world are still colored by his Christian mindset, which can be frustrating if you are looking for cultural relativity, or delightful, as it allows you to sympathize with many of the characters, who are of occidental descent and out of place in Egypt."
2,Mediocre PostgreSQL coverage,"For beginnners to postgreSQL , this book has a decent coverage. I will bet there is nothing to beat the Momjian online PostgreSQL reference. I have learntmore than practical postgreSQL from Bruce.It's a sheer waste of your money."
4,Good Purchase,"I purchased the Himalayan Crystal Salt Inhaler because of the proven results on inhaling ocean air. I have observed and heard others say the same; that inhaling the ocean air can be experienced. I for one notice a ""cleaning effect"" of the lungs. After leaving the ocean I feel my lungs can hold more oxygen.Thus giving me more energy and a better overall feeling."
3,Not bad,"The book has ideas on how to live life to the fullest regardless of circumstances we are facing such as retirement. Some of these ideas include and are not limited to; learning how to make retirement your glory days, focusing on your physical wellbeing, retiring to work and so on. The author has also focused on teaching retirees on how to manage their pension. This book seeks to inform retirees that retirement is not the end of life but it can be starting point of making good use of time they have. This book will make a good read for people who are skeptical and afraid of retiring. Auhor of Hidden Credit Repair Secrets"
3,pretty good Valley film,Alicia Silverstone does a solid job in this film.she looks good to.this film is very believable in that the 80's had the Valley films and this one works.however the rest of the cast doesn't match Silverstone's wit and that's what drops the film a bit.but if you dug 80's Valley films then you should check this one out.
2,Valley dumb : like totally lame,"Boy, I miss the Emma parallel here: Jane Austin's girlhave a little class, this little dork b-tch is a shame on us all?A valley girl with a vacuum isn't a good role modelfor anybody.Make over into a human is what she needs?The head kid seems to have more humanitythan the lead actress.I lost my sense of humor here about the time shegot A's for setting up her teachers...She needs a parent of some sort."
1,What?,"I read the good reviews, saw it was a hit, so went to see it. It was so boring, badly written and acted, I left the theater half way through the movie."
5,Really good,"I love the interviews, the extras, but i didn't see Alicia that much, but it was really good and fun to watch"
1,Monstrosity,"By the point of my sword, this hideous movie and all it stands for deserve to be wiped off the face of the earth."
1,The worst kind of thing Hollywood can offer us ...,"Hollywood and the American omive industry can produce some of the best entertainment products of all times : supense films like ""SEVEN"", ""THE SIXTH SENSE""; comedies like ""AIRPLANE"", dramas like ""DEAD POETS SOCIETY"", so oon, so on. But it also can deliver terrible motion pictures like this ""CLUELESS"". I don't know how Alicia accepted to shoot this picture. It's totally pointless, fruitless, no meaning at all, a pure MTV style product. The main character who is a ""cult person"" sometimes give a good critic, but in the end he stays with Silverstone's character, which passed thourgh a ""deep"" transformation: she did a single charity campaing ! Sad history, empty characters, bad screenplay."
3,"Feeling tubby, or ticklish, Alicia?","So few film good film roles go to women and so few pictures are made about women. Most movies cast women as prostitutes, wives, girlfriends or victims. CLUELESS succeeds as both an easy-going comedy and a film about an individual teen-age girl - not the girl who got picked up or victimized.Question: when the step-brother gooses Alicia Silverstone's midsection, is she slapping his hand away because she didn't like the remark about her weight, or because she is ticklish?"
5,I loved it! It's a totally awesome movie!,I think its the best movie .The way Cher acts like such a valley girl is so cool.It's my all time favorite movie! 2 thumbs up
2,Not so good.,Like a so so TV comedy. Tired dialogue delivered with the best of intent by capable actors. Barf me. Choose something else.
4,Amazing Show!,That Buffalo Sweat Show was simply great....the DVD is the highest quality! It was extremely enjoyable! Bobby And jerry were really together that night!
5,Good ol' Grateful Dead,"Best Dead DVD release hand down! The whole band is tight and Jerry is smiling and dancing throughout. Standouts for me were Stagger Lee, Touch, and Dew. I Will Take You Home brought a tear to my eye, Very Sweet! You have to own this.Words cannot describe."
4,Perfect Angel/Adventures in Paradise...,"Good combination album from the now legedary Minnie Riperton! You get a real taste of what this artist could do with that multi-octave voice! She needed NO electronic assistance to create, unlike the artists of today...Five stars!"
5,Breathtaking,"It is so sad that Minnie never got the recognition for being one of our most gifted singers. With range, soul & seduction, she makes my blood sizzle. The disc is remastered superlatively."
4,BRUCE Moonlights as a Singer as well!,"I first heard these songs on a CD where he labels himself as BRUNO. I was first blown away it was Bruce Willis, but I remember the stuff he would sing occasionally on ""Moonlighting"". The songs are Old Classics- with a special twist on his James Bondish re-do of SECRET AGENT MAN (awesome). When I decided to get the BRUNO CD, it was pretty much unavailable or too expen$ive. This CD from Universal Collections is the SAME thing at a usually low Amazon price (so just get it!)."
4,Inspirations in people and yarn,"There are many wonderful stories and inspirational designsin this book. It will make you wish you lived near the shopsprofiled and may lead to new shopping discoveries. My onlyquibble is that many of the designs seem to be ""show-off""items, either more complicated than the average knitterwould make or using expensive yarns. This trend is fine forinspiration but not as helpful if you want to sit down andknit one of the items."
5,Very good and comprehensive book on knitting,"This is a very good book about knitting. What I like most is all of the different tips and suggestions for knitting techniques. They are very good tips that are easy to follow and remember. The patterns that are provided in the book are very good as well. It is nice because there is a good variety of patterns. I have been knitting for over 40 years and still found the book very helpful and informative. I would highly recommend this book for all knitters, no matter how experienced."
4,Different Cover than Listing,"The book I received was as described, but had an entirely different cover from the listing. Perhaps next time create a listing with the actual cover."
1,ok if you like power point presentations in a book,"The ""Head Rush"" is very much like notebook scribles. Not really suitable for developers but maybe ok for understand what its all about, like a technical breifing. There are far better books for developers such as AJAX in Action and Professional AJAX.If you are a project manager and just want AJAX in 5mins then this is good one to read on the train, your deveopment team would not want it."
5,Great Batteries for my Camera Equipment,I ordered these batteries for my radio remote shutter for my Canon 40D. These 3.0 volt Sanyo replacement batteries gave the same life the I got from the original CR2 batteries that came with the unit -so no complaints.
3,good cd with a really great song and a bad song,"I really liked the song eagle when she flies. It seems to touch up the CD. Romeo isn't very good, though."
1,Beware. Seriously Bad Quality,Please be aware that this is a live recording and the sound quality/mix is very poor. Even staying on key was not nowhere near what one would have expected from Queen. Freddie is also nowhere near his normal best and struggled to keep and reach certain notes. The person/persons that did the mix for the 5.1 surround sound was not at all successful and the second last track is atrocious. I was severly disappointed.
4,"Ignore other reviews, this is a re-issue","All the other reviews here relate to the previously released DVD. This one is a NEW ""special edition"" of the concert.

4,At last a Queen DVD.,"This is the first Queen DVD and also the first VHS release off a Queen Video. I Bought this video in the early eighties. At the thime the video won serveral awards! the concert was also shoot in the early eighties. Later we had Live at Budapest en Live at Wembely etc. This are better movies, but yout have to see this film in the right space of time. For a fil from the eighties it's great. I played this DVD over a great Dolby Digital sound system with a video projector and big screen. The sound and fils is great. I bought the Dutch version! This is a nice DVD for people who like."
3,Nice Bag - Wrong Size,"I purchased this bag to use with my Olympus C7000z and once I unpacked it, I discovered that while it is the right length and width, it is too deep for the camera.The camera has a habit of sliding around front to back. I had to put my cell phone in with the camera to keep it from slooshing around.It has a small zip compartment on the top that I keep a spare battery, but the small interal pocket on the inside that I assume is for extra XDcards does not work out. It is too loose for the XD card and the card keeps popping out while you walk around. I was afraid that it would spill out when I pulled out my camera, so I ended up placing it in the top zippered compartment with the spare battery.Otherwise, the velcroed top cover offers easy access to your camera without having clumsy clips or latches that need to be unclipped in a hurry"
5,The Perfect Case for All Purposes,"The perfect little black nylon case for my Olympus C765. It's not too big or too small. It's only slightly larger than the camera itself. It easily holds the camera and strap. It has about a 1/2 inch thick insulated sides to kind of cushion the camera. The strap on the case is just the right length to hang over your shoulder, or it has a belt loop on the back side. You can slide the memory card holder down inside the case with the camera, and you can put extra camera batteries in a small zippered pouch on top. The only thing that won't fit in the case is the battery charger if you have one. It also has an easily opened velcro closing top."
2,Not for GWTW fans!!,"I have read both the original GWTW as well as Alexandria Ripley's, Scarlett, watched both movies and listened to the book on tape of ""Scarlett"" and while I think it is an ok follow-up not for the die hard GWTW fans!! We know what her personality was supposed to be, what Margaret Mitchell intended her to be. I think she was playing to be helpless but she really wasn't helpless. You also cannot simply follow Vivian Leigh or Clark Gable. Joanne Whaley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton acting was ok, but just ok. It was ok for a made for tv movie wrote like a soap opera, but not for a follow up to GWTW. It would have been better to not have been made like making a sequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"", just can't be done. I think Marageret Mitchell would have been mortified or as in her words, it would have given her the ""vapors'!"
3,"Not like the Book, but Still a Good Movie","I have read both GWTW and Scarlett many times. I would not say that this movie stayed with the book at all, but Timothy Dalton and Whalley-Kilmer both did excellent jobs of following in legendary footsteps (Gable and Leigh). You have to remember that movies are not books and the time that it would have taken to fit the book of Scarlett into a movie would never have worked. The important thing is that the ending is basically the same. If you have some sort of strange attachment to the book Scarlett then this is not a movie for you, but if you can recognize good work without comparing it to the book, you will enjoy Scarlett the movie."
2,"Nothing like the book, and the book isn't even good!","The book isn't very good, and the book is always better than the movie, so I have no idea why I wasted my time watching this, but I did. The movie has almost nothing in common with the book! And the book isn't good, either. If you want to watch a movie, watch GWTW again, not this!"
1,Scarlett Special Collectors,When I recieved the vhs. The second tape was broken and the tape pulled out of the cassete. I am not happy with this purchase. I did not send it back because it was only 5 dollars.
1,A major disappoint!,"This movie shouldn't have Gone With the Wind added to it! The movie is definately NOT what Margerart Mitchell would have dreamed up! Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley. I am utterly disappointed."
4,A Great & Surprising Mini-Series!,"I have loved 'Gone With The Wind' since I saw it on HBO in the 80's. I have watched my VHS tape about 100 times and the DVD about half a dozen times so far. I think that in some ways, this story is more romantic than GWTW. Of course if you make comparisons, no one can replace Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, but I must say that Timothy Dalton had my blood pressure rising!!! The story line was very interesting and I feel that is certainly brought the original story to a conclusion after 55 years. Didn't we all want to find out if Rhett went back to Scarlett or did she marry Ashley?? The supporting cast was great with Julie Harris, Stephen Collins, Jean Smart, .... Joanne Whalley is very pretty, and fit into the role of Scarlett very well. How interesting that the two actresses to play Scarlett were both from England- I really liked this mini-series, and would recommend it to even the die hard GWTW fans!"
1,Why John Gielgud?! Why??!!,"What was one of the greatest actors of the century doing in this southern soap? What next? Vanessa Redgrave in ""Cleopatra""?"
2,Did not do Alexandra Ripley's Work Justice,"The costumes and scenery were great--and it was nice to see so much of Charleston represented, as I used to live there. However, I somewhat doubt that any of the actors involved read ""Scarlett,"" much less GWTW! I wonder if whoever wrote the screenplay even bothered to read either work all the way through. It surely doesn't seem like it.It is all very sad because Ms. Ripley's book is really good! Maybe someone else will remake it in movie form one day and do a better job of it."
3,Don't Judge The Book By the Movie,"I am a huge fan of Gone With the Wind. From the time I read the book when I was around twelve, I fell in love with it. Alexander Ripley's sequel, Scarlett, was also a pretty good book. It was creative and I loved how Scarlett grew and the storyline. It gave a sort of closure. Of course, no one can expect it to be anywhere near the original, but it was a damn good job. The movie, however, isn't nearly as good as the book. Read the book. Skip the movie. No one but Vivien Leigh could ever play Scarlett, so they shouldn't even try."
5,Very nice,This monitor was a wonderful bargain. I got more than I paid for and am extremely satisfied.
4,"An good novel, but not nearly as good as Boyle's other books","T.C. Boyle's books are always a joy to read, because of the author's expert use of the language. East is East, however, doesn't quite match up to the rest of the Opus. The quirky realism the author usually displays doesn't shine in this novel, and it's characters appear more as satirical caricatures than merely unusual people. The novel is better than works by most other authors, but not as good as it's own author's other work."
4,Insightful read,Jo is an amazing woman. Someone who is truly inspirational and has the ability to weave her words and thoughts together to inspire the reader. I will recommend this book to my friends as I enjoyed it every step of the way. Thank you Jo for sharing your life we us.
5,"INSIGHTFUL, HONEST AND COURAGEOUS","Jo Singel's book serves as a beacon to all those interested in personal growth through self-analysis. Her writing is pithy, humorous and a ""quick read"" which surprisingly stays with the reader for weeks and months to come. It teaches us that understanding our past is the first step to self-acceptance, growth, and ultimately fulfillment. I enjoyed every second and could not put it down. Congratulations, Jo. Well done!!"
1,Uninspired mystery,"After reading this book's description I really looked forward to sitting down with it . . . and was terribly disappointed when I did. Unfortunately this tale runs out of gas in less than 100 pages, which is doubly unfortunate as the book goes for over 200 pages. There really isn't much of a mystery, the plot is contrived and simple, the characters are wooden and one dimensional and the flavor of Ireland advertised on the cover is no more than a few scenes in a few pubs. To me this read more like a made for TV movie script, (How to Write a Mystery in 3 East Steps), rather than a novel. This one didn't work for me."
3,Pros and Cons...,"Pros:-This book greatly improved my shopping techniques.-More Hand-Eye Coordination. My Badmitten game has been enhanced.-Ease of knee movement. Lots of pain has been channeled from my left knee into a radio set which is not working anymore.Cons:-Does not give directions for rituals while vacationing in the southern hemispheres. Should they be done backwards or counter-clockwise, etc?-While the techniques descibed did aid in communicating with my other self, have realized that there are hermetic openings that have been opened, and have had random accidents as a result.-Book got wet in accident and pages have fused togethor, and the book does not give directions for unfusing the pages in the event of getting wet.. Unable to read current copy.Thanks!"
3,"Don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.","It's pretty cheap and basic. A good kids' drum, but the head is also pretty cheap, so don't expect it to last long. The beater has a nice handle, but the head is odd. Feels like a stack of cardboard disks wrapped in felt. It is tunable, it is easy to work, it does make an acceptable thunk when struck with the beater, and it probably will do OK when built into a banjolele. (This shows up with an indicator that others buy it with the Grizzly Ukulele kit, likely for this reason.) Have fun, but don't expect a professional hand drum."
5,What's with Dracula Fan????,"I don't know where ""Dracula Fan"" was coming from with his/her 1-star review. Maybe the reviewer wanted to knock down the rating of this excellent book for some reason. Or maybe he or she is someone who has trouble following clear, concise recipes--after all, the reviewer can't even spell ""recipes."" I love this book--it's fun, stylish, and not at all hard to read. No, it doesn't have pictures, but it doesn't need them. The recipes are easy, VERY clear and every one makes perfect sense. More to the point, the drinks TASTE good and every single one we've made have been a huge hit with friends and family."
4,A & P,I bought it for my daughter for christmas. She said they are really cool and will help her in college. thanks!
5,Awesome!,"This is a 6 months long telenovela shortened into about 10 hours. Anyone who thinks the ENTIRE novela is going to be on the DVD isn't being realistic. Would I buy a 10 DVD set of the whole thing - HECK YES! But, in the meantime, this hits ALL the high notes and skips alot of the (in some cases boring) details. I saw the novela when it came out and am watching it again now during its rebroadcast. Did not bother me at all that the music was not the same - I can download the song anytime. Again, loved it, fantastic price, so happy to have it!"
3,Great on sale.,"Caught these knives on a Christmas sale. I, unlike others, haven't had a problem with keeping an edge on the smaller knife. After a good honing, I can split hairs. The larger knife blade isn't the best of steel, but it can work well as a general utility knife. If you can catch this one for, say, $10 off, you should get it."
4,Good blades!,"Great deal! High quality construction with a name you can trust. They could be a bit sharper, my Victorinox pocket knife was much sharper out of the box. Both knives have nice finishes and good but stiff action. This will loosen up with use, but don't expect to open the larger of the two with one hand on the first use. The smaller of the two has a standard opening style. I think that it is a great deal for the price."
2,"Awkward size, bad ergonomics","I'm a pilot and recreational camper looking for a knife suitable for the flight bag as well as survival. The paraframe looked like a good knife online, but in my hand I'm disgusted with it. Way to heavy on the large knife, and far too small on the small knife. Both are razor sharp but ergonomically would cut into your hand with repeated use.Poor design means no lanyard attachment ability, and the belt clips are... meh."
2,existential babble at its almost-worst...,"....the only piece worth having the book for is Rollo May's intro. The rest is badly written and highly jargonized psychology that pretends to be focused on the conditions of human existence but in fact goes all over the philosophical map, continually falling into valleys of unbelievable obscurity."
1,Our 1896 version is TERRIBLE,"I can only describe this book as the rantings of a deranged lunatic. I have no idea how this ever became published, and our world is the lesser because this book exists."
3,"not another visiting, anoying, female and critical digitary","As you can see in the title, I'm not amused by yet another plotline which features a visiting dignitary-with-pretentions. I was also bored by plotdivises as the hidden political agenda's and well kept secrets, that are used to send the Enterprise on it's mission. That's not what Star Trek is about (IMVHO)But then, on page 95, the book starts again (or at last) with a surprise and a bang. All at once there is a real antagonist, a real plotline, with tension of it's own, and a danger to avert not only for the Enterprise, but for Starfleet as a whole. And the dignitary turns out to be not half as bad, as she had seemed all these pages.So: this is not the best of books. Do not recomment it to non-Trekkies, 'cause - after reading this - they'll never believe Star trek is fun. But if you have patience and perseverance, than there's a good chance you'll at least enjoy the second half of the book."
5,From Guitar Strings to Heartstrings,"For Neil Diamond fans, and anyone who likes a good, sappy love song. Hello Again and Love on the Rocks will jerk your tears; America will make you clap to the beat. Every track is golden. See the movie (great fun), then dance and sing to the CD. Fun, fun, fun!"
2,Terrible Movie.. Decent Album,"This semi decent soundtrack is good as long as you haven't seen the movie... otherwise the schlock of the movie will make this CD of work a bitter pill to swallow, and your thoughts will be filled with terrible, terrible acting by Lucy Arnaz and Lawrence Olivier. I would suggest buying another Neil Diamond CD made before this one. The Diamond CDs only get worse as the years go on, and the Jazz Singer Soundtrack is the last listenable thing made by Neil Diamond. ""America"", ""Love on the Rocks"", ""Songs of Life"" and ""Summerlove"" are pretty good tunes. Those tunes make the disc worth owning for a hardcore fan.. However, ""You Baby"", ""Hey Louise"", ""Acapulco"", ""On The Robert E Lee"" and ""Jerusalem"" are utter garbage. ""Amazed and Confused"" is unlistenable. ""Adon Olom"" and ""Kol Nidre/My Name Is Yussel"" are just things put on the album to take up space. I would suggest Stones, Moods, or Greatest Hits over this..they are money well spent.. the Jazz Singer is not."
4,Fun to play,"I purchased this game for my 9 year old nephew. He has a 5 year old brother. My 22 year old daughter and I played it with them and we had a great time. We did some things a little different due to the 5 year old. The two children were already to play again after we played the first time. I even learned new things about some of the states. I think it also helps the children learn where each of the states are located, as each player gets their own map of the states. It's also good that they have to slap the card and say the name of the state and how it meets the description the search card is looking for. It also helps them learn the pronunciation of the state names and the capitals."
5,"A game that's fun for kids and adults - and educational for both, too!","This game was actually really fun for me as a parent - not all kid games are, as you may know. It's also a great way to learn US geography! My almost seven year old son was not interested at all, but, after letting my almost 10 year old daughter win a couple of rounds, she didn't want to stop - even when she started losing. I love having this companion to the book."
1,Never produced one drop of skimmate.,This unit never produced one drop of skimmate. It never even came close. I replaced it very quickly. This unit was a waste of money.
3,Runs small,My son is eight and this size 8-10 fit my daughter of age 6. We were disappointed because of the sizing but it was too late in the season to send it back and get a larger size for my son. We made do. The quality was good as Walmart or Target.
3,After Reading This You'll Keep Your Enemies Far Away,"This book left me totally speechless. The book is very graphic on child abuse, drugs, sexual assaults etc. And if you can't stomach this type of reading, then this is not the book for you to read. Vindictive Wo-men had the hair on my neck stand straight-up. But in reality, The characters in the book portray some real life people. The writer and the book puts you in the mind of Donald Goines. He lived in Detroit and wrote a lot of his books while he was incarcerated about the real dealings on the streets of Detroit and other cities. This book is definitely a guide for parents to take notice of their kids when they seem to act differently around certain people. Your friends are not always your friends. All in all the book was rather informative."
2,"No, it's not the Paderewski","Speaking of correcting misinformation, this is definitely *not* the Paderewski edition. The Mikuli and Paderewski editions are certainly not the same, although if you look in the commentary in the back of any Paderewski Chopin score, you will find that the Mikuli is one of the many sources that were consulted for the Paderewski.Dover used to publish a reproduction of the Paderewski edition years ago, and it was wonderful. Unfortunately, they no longer seem to do so."
5,A great little gem,"A nice selection of songs from a more gentle, romantic time. I wish Tina had more albums out there - I'd definately buy more."
1,Pass on this one,"i really don't understand who makes the decisions to put which albums on cd. i really like bits and pieces of the sons material. lossen up naturally has a few great songs, most of welcome to the dance is awesome and a circle filled with love (only available on vinyl to my knowledge) is super, but i didn't find a single keeper on this cd."
3,Loved the new writing from Japan,Loved reading new writing from Japan. Loved the stories of younger writers who write so differently from the older Japanese writers.
3,"Sturdy, but too low","I purchased this chair for my 4-year-old son after reviewed the item description, 1year to 5 years age range. However, this chair was too low for him. Back of chair was barely touched his waist when he was sitting. Although the general quality was sturdy, I had no choice but to return this item. I recommend this chair for the kids under age 32 months."
2,Kinda Weak. Already cracking,Its not really stone. Its kind of brittle and weak and it is already starting the fracture. But it is very rough.
1,MISREPRESENTED,"This is a good book for children but I was under the impression that it was geared towards adults. I was very disapointed. There is no pertinent information provided in this book. If you are looking for facts or statistics, look else where. If you are looking for a book to read to your 5 year old, you are in the right place."
3,Good for some,"It's a great set. It will feature the TV movie I Dream of Jeannie 15 Years Later (1985). If you go to tvshowsondvd.com they list this set and the features. I emailed sony because I too think they should release one set with Black and White. I also told them that they should release the movie separately along with the second TV movie I Still Dream of Jeannie(1991). I think they should have put the movie on Season 5 as a bonus. This set is a slap in the face and a way to get money out of people. It doesn't benefit those of us who already own Seasons 1-3 or 1-4. The set is good for those who have no I Dream of Jeannie at all. And because it's still inprint, it wouldn't be worth it to try to sell it for a few bucks. I hope Sony takes my suggestion. I hate when companies pull these tricks to get money out of people."
3,BAAAAAD Packaging!,Love the show...always will. THIS PACKAGING IS THE WORST PACKAGING EVER!!!! Fortunately I will be ripping these shows to digital files and streaming to my Apple TV. Dealing with the discs is a NIGHTMARE!
2,horrible customer service,"Scale a little difficult to set up. Had problem with downloading rates from internet. Called for support help. Phone number in instr. manual was wrong,not toll free, long wait to talk with someone. Gave me another phone number. No one answers and no way to leave message at second phone number. Called back first number said he couldn't help me. Very frustrating. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Finally got it set up. Very complicated for mailing regular daily letters. Must push several buttons to get weight and postage for one letter. After you get postage for one letter you have to push five buttons to get back to the starting point. Tried pushing buttons as suggested, it does not work. I am sending this scale back. Mainly due to lack of support in getting familiar with the use of this product."
3,Nice scale but the internet rate update stinks,"The scale is a nice scale, is accurate and does the rate calculation well for a variety of shippers, but the rate update over the internet really stinks. Most of the time the service never responds at all and almost all the rest of the time it responds intially and then just sits there trying to download rates forever. This is a repeatable failure on multiple computers from multiple locations. Just a word of caution, although the built in rate feature is great, you may never actually be able to update the rates."
2,Sorry Sam.......,"Sorry Sam. Your tips don't work... Even with the batteries installed and wall power connected.. BTW. the manual states that only the wall charger needs to be installed. They just dont want you to use just the batteries.I found that updating the software worked fine but updating postal rate is, at the moment, impossible. I also notice that Royal does not make the RC40 anymore. Hummm, could this be the cause? Anyway I will be calling tech support (800-272-6229) to see what they have to say.Hello India!"
3,ok,"ordered on my kindle, it was ok movie. Music and dancing always entertaining but story pretty weak. Occupied an afternoon I was recovering from the flu"
1,Blu-ray disappointment,"I bought this thinking I would be able to upgrade to Blu-ray on my computer which did not have that capability. However, I found it unbelievably complicated due to the 3-4 step process to do so. I then cancelled the process & the $99 charge. So I have not reviewed this movie in Blu-ray."
1,Not worth the time,"I started watching this movie and shut it off about ten minutes in. Same old, same old. Tough girl meets rich guy, street life meets dance academy, blah, blah, blah. Best part was Channing Tatum in the beginning. Other than that, don't spend money to watch this."
4,good movie,This movie makes you want to get up and dance with them. The people are really good at the parts that they play.
5,Step up to da sterrts,Outstanding dancing in this movie salsa hip hop great cast stoy was pretty good too i really n joyed this movie the final dance off is excellent didnt no the body could do the things these kids do.
5,Better than the first!,I thought it was a lot better than the first because there was a lot more dancing and I think these characters are easier to relate to.
1,Cheap plastic junk,"Like every other cheap plastic hose caddy I've owned in the past, this one leaked. Plastic hose fitting threads are doomed to leak sooner or later. I'm done wasting my money on them. Time to look for a more expensive, better-working brand."
3,"Item is good, shipping was BAD!","I bought this item to replace one just like it that had lasted over 6 years. I did buy another one but it came in broken due to shipping. I returned it for a refund. I ordered this one. It ALSO came in cracked, but I'll keep it because I don't want to wait for a replacement or refund again. This hose reel should be as good as my first one, but it will always irk me due to the cracked housing!"
3,hose container,It keeps the hose untangled and neat looking outside the garage. The unit does move when you try to pull the hose out if not anchored on the ground. But I put up with it for the look of neatness and the price.
3,Average Place to Hide My Hose,"My hose do get all tangled up in this thing. But it is nice to keep them somewhere they don't get too hot; it keeps them from getting cracked out. I like to keep my hose out of the sun and rain. I may not be the best hose owner, but it's the least I can do."
2,Fragile,I have owned three of these hose carts and two have fallen apart within a year. I have just purchased the Jackson 2517100 all metal unit and it is rock solid and runs like a charm. Costs more but I anticipate it will be with me for many years.Jackson 2517100 Decorative Metal Deck Hose Reel With 150-Foot Hose Capacity
2,Whodun this lackluster effort?,"I felt cheated when I bought this book, and in fact, I ended up returning it. The efforts put forth by the authors for this anthology were lackluster for the most part. MJD's story was not even up to her usual hilarious standards, and I really had a hard time understanding why the two characters got together since there was little developement about their backgrounds, which matched the skimpy plot. Do yourself a favor, borrow a friend's copy or go to the library, but this is not worth the cover price."
4,"""A Neat Little Book""","At 190 pages, maybe it's not so little. However ""Aces"" is packed with short biographies and many actual ""combat reports"" of 26 fighter pilots in the Eighth Air Force who achieved ""Ace"" status while protecting B-17s and B-24s flying out of England. It does not include ""Aces"" of other theaters of World War II.This is not fine literature and was not intended to be. The combat reports are reproduced ""as written"" by the pilots and were considered when determining ""kill"" credits.This book also has many great old photographs of the pilots with their trusted fighter planes. When reading these combat reports one starts to get a feel for the wonderful capabilities of the old P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs. Our fighter technology back then in these particular ships was superior to the enemy's until the Germans came out with the Me 262 jet.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the United States Army Air Force during World War II."
4,Liked.,A good read. Very well written. Kept me in suspence with the right characters. the book exceeded my expectations and I've recommended it to friends.
2,AVERAGE YARN.,After reading all the hype about Mosley I was bored reading this tale.Chester Himes remains The Man for black crime fiction.
5,Indoor volleyball outlast the best leather ones,"I use to buy Tachikara SV-5W Gold volleyballs for my volleyball league until the price of the ball has gotten to much for my budget. And on top of that, they only last about a year before they go flat and don't hold air for even one night. The Mikasa's have lasted far beyond the Tachikara's and they also still look good season after season. I like the colored balls better than the plan white ones because our gym has windows that cause a glare and the ball gets washout when they go pass them."
3,Unusual for 80s fiction,"When this collection of fiction appeared it had nothing to do with other 80s writing, such as minimalism or magic realism. Ms. Benedict's hard-scrabble characters (most of whom have a spiritual insight in the story) remind me a lot of Flannery O'Connor's, except Benedict forgoes a Catholic explanation of these insights. Some of these stories have the generality, and power, of myth. A few of the pieces are slight or repetitive, and the same words crop up over and over. The final story of the collection is flawless."
2,Nope,"It seemed to work well for about a week, and then everyone on the other end said they could barely hear me (although I could hear them just fine)."
2,static,"This product is not good quality. When it works, the sound is satisfactory. However, when connected to my LG 150 phone I have trouble positioning the connector so that it will not produce static noise. I do not recommend this product."
1,Do not buy this product!,I can't even use this product - the sound is way too muffled! Every single person I've spoken with hasn't been able to hear me. I have had to repeat myself over and over again. Waste of money (even though it only cost a cent +shipping).
1,I really wouldn't buy this if I were you,Unfortunately I read a few of the reviews warning not to buy this piece of crap but bought anyway thinking it was an original equipment manufacturer's version which worked fine but it wasn't. Be very aware that this is truly a waste of money no matter how cheap it is. I am constantly told my voice can not be heard but the background noise comes through like 'gangbusters'. You can hear who you are talking too but they can barely hear you.
1,Static and Poor Reception,The headsets were not expensive but they did not work.The earphones were not clear and the mic had static to the extent that the other party heard loud distortion and echo.I purchased 3 and the same defects were in each device.
5,Refreshing and Innovative,This is the best book on training games I have ever read. It gives new insight that I have found lacking in other authors. Sharyn Weiss is a genious in her trade. Thank you for making my job in executive and managerial training easier.
5,Great Product,"I really liked this whitening system, and it is one of the best ones I used. As for the first review, they obviously did not follow the directions, and just pressed gently. The peach and melon both taste very good, and adhered to my teeth better than any other product I've used. While Crest Whitestrips are stronger, they have less gel and move around too much, so I saw much greater and faster improvement with these. I had no pain from the gel, but I understand that each mouth is different, as I can't handle Crest Whitestrips because those do sting me. As for the gel, it does leave a thick residue, but will come off easily with a wet papertowel or toothbrush. I would reccomend this to most anyone."
3,"Far from his best, but Barker always satisfies...","Cabal is one of Clive Barker's earlier books, and while It does not have the depth or captivating imagery of his previous book ""The Damanation Game"", it is still a fine read. Canadian readers will enjoy the fact the story is set in Northern Alberta. While another reviewer preferred the movie, I think it paled in comparison to the book... Barker is one of the truly great Horror-Fantasy writers of all time and one needs to condition themselves to his style... He weaves not only horror and fantasy... he spins equal amounts of black comedy and erotosism into his work... A real balancing act.Start with his books of blood (a series of short stories) and then read Damnation game (his first full-length novel) and you will soon find yourself suspended in his worlds.... There are wondefully wicked and horrifying places... You'll love you stay!Weezer"
1,Fooled,"I paid for that specific cover instead I was sent a really worn 1989 print with torn pages and a thousand stickers on the back or sticker ressidue. Its a great book I love all of Clive Barker books at this point I was just trying to fill up my book shelves and collect all my favorites, unfortantly this one wont make it quality is just not good enough. Very upset!"
4,wowwwww,"I liked this book. ""Cody"" Neal is a real peice of work.His rants were totally off the wall.This was a good read. Just a little slow during the court precedings."
3,"Good, but a bit out-of-date","This book is very helpful to gain insight on the feeding habits of our wildlife. However, this book was first printed in 1951 and is somewhat out of date. With all the studies that have taken place since then, it would be a great idea if a second, updated version were to be released. I say buy the book, but look deeper into the pros and cons of any ""great wildlife plant"" before you go and place it on your farm."
3,A passionless mystery,"This tale of Sherlock Holmes investigating the disappearance of some bonds, prior to their issue, in the vaults of the Bank of England and in high society is an odd mixture.On the one hand, the mystery is well constructed and its investigation, including the slow piecing together of disparate pieces of information to create a sensible whole is excellent.On the other, the story is related in such a clinical and passionless fashion that it fails to excite the interest of the reader, if appealing to the intellect.Probably on par with some of the lower-average Holmes stories from the pen of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle."
4,DEAR ABBY GONE WRONG,"Dear Lovey Hart, I am Desperate is basically about a high school newspaper decided to start an advice column. The person who will be dispensing advice would write under the name Lovey Hart. Guess who got chosen? Our intrepid heroine of the story. Sure it is fun to give out advice to others, but it seems that it is even more fun to hang around with Chip, the blond hunky editor of the school paper.Our heroine started out pretty well....even getting a thank you letter from one person who followed her advice and changed her life. But as time went on, Lovey Hart went from savior to scapegoat, as people who followed her advice blindly and ended up worse than where they started. Well, it got to the point where our heroine can't even tell anybody she's Lovey Hart or she would be laughed out of town.Well the ending is quite interesting. Also a very funny book."
5,great book,"i think Dear Lovey Hart, I am Desperate is a great book. Its also funny. Its about a girl that writes for the school paper. She answers all the questions kids have to ask Lovey Hart. No one knows who she is except the paper's editor! Read to find out what happens to Lovey Hart!!"
5,Abingdon Unveiled,"Abingdon pottery is one of the hidden treasures of the Midwest that Joe Paradis has now shared with the rest of the world. I found the book after I had acquired a few pieces. It explains the unique quality of the product, such as the weight and the gloss. Paradis includes cross-referenced lists by item name and stock number. It is very comprehensive, readable, and the photography is excellent."
5,Herman,I love Jim Unger's sense of humor. I have several of his cartoon books and enjoy every one of them. It is amazing how he can take the every day and make us laugh.
5,Great first buy,"Always wanted one of these since ages and never found the perfect combination of tools - took me 10 years, but I finally got there :o) :o)Not much I can add to the already detailed reviews available here on this product.Good buy overall and is still the best ""mobile"" tool-set money can buy."
5,Very nice and usefull knife.,"I own 4 Victorinox knifes and this is the best of them all.I had a little problem with delivery of the product - the USPS post guy took the original shipment and kept it for him self ( I supose ), because he explain how he put the package inside my garage, which is impossible - I'm always keep my garage locked! There for I contacted Amazon.com and was nicely surprised when they told me I will get another knife. It took me exchanging of 3-4 e-mails and about 2 weeks to get the replacement, but I'm very pleased whith the knife!All the tools are easy to be open (I had problem with that in another pair of knifes) and very, very useful. I'm taking the knife for hiking in Colorado where it will pay itself back in 10 days!Thank you, Amazon.com!"
4,Victorinox Champion Plus,I knew what I wanted; a Swiss Army knife with a bigger nail file than what I usually see in pocket knives. This one definitely filled the bill.
5,This knife is awesome!,"While it is way too heavy and bulky for backpacking, this is perfect for carrying in my handbag. It is an amazing price and a great knife from an awesome company - we had one of our other Swiss Army knives break (from our own misuse) I e-mailed Victorinox and they said if we mailed the broken knife back to them, they would repair or replace it at no charge. We received the replacement within a very short time. That is true customer service!"
5,THE best Swiss army knife for the money.,"Other similar (and sometimes less useful) Swiss army knives sell for twice as much. This knife is awesome and I find myself using it nearly every day. If you often do any type of physical labor, this thing will bail you out over and over again. Whether its the knife, the saw, the screwdriver, scissors, bottle opener, cork screw, ballpoint pen, needle, tweezers... you won't regret carrying this thing around.The only thing that kind of sucks is the magnifying glass. It's a little overkill and it just looks silly. Other than that, every tool is very practical."
4,Very good knife.,"My wife lost the Swiss Army knife my dad gave me 20-some years ago for First Communion. I bought this knife as a replacement in hopes that I will eventually give it to a son or nephew of mine, when they're age-appropriate.It's a very nice knife, all red and shiny and new. Also, very well stocked. And by stocked, I mean there's just about everything tucked in there somewhere. Seriously, I find new stuff every day.I rated this knife a four out of five because the book that came with it is pretty useless. I have friends who are technical writers and I know a lousy instruction manual when I see one, if you know what I mean."
5,The best,"Can't beat the emotional feel of holding this marvelous tool. The Swiss Champion Plus, which does NOT have the pliers is great. The full Swiss Champion has the pliers but costs about $35 more and it's not worth the addfitional costs.Comes in a nice box (just plain with formed lining) and complete instructions on all the features. You will never use them all but having them there will provide one that can help when needed."
5,"Great Deal, Great Quality","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old brother, who has always admired my dad's elaborate pocket knife that he has had since he was 12. I took my chances purchasing this, since I admit that I am a teenage girl that really has absolutely NO idea about anything relating to pocket knives, and just hoped that he would like it. The shipping time was great, I chose the ""Free Super Saver"" shipping option, and it arrived earlier than predicted. When I got it, I noticed it was quite heavy for a pocket knife. Carefully sliding open the smaller sized box it was packaged in, I was completely surprised with the quality. It was about the size of a small cell phone, glossy, and completely full of different tools, including a magnifying glass and a saw. I got such a great deal, it's really great quality! I know he is going to love it!"
5,Love it,"I got this as a birthday present for my little cousin, and it was so cool, and such a great price I had to buy it for myself."
5,Great purchase!,I bought 3 knives at a great price. My sons and son-in-law were very happy with them - I could tell because they played with them off and on for the rest of the day! And they are grown up men ------
5,Great Tool...,I carried a knife identical to this one for 20+ years and I wanted a replacement... The new knife is actually much improved over the one I lost... Thank You Victrinox.Robert Khayyam Johnson
4,Came sooner than I expected,"This watch came a day sooner than I expected. Great knife, I played with it the entire day I was in the office which passed the timepretty well. My only complaint is that the steal crevaces in between the tools is stained. Other than that, it's a handy tool to have around"
4,All the little loonies.,"Sweet Relief II is worth it just for 2 tracks: Kick My A%% by Garbage and Guilty by Association by Joe Henry and Madonna. That's all I gotta say, amazing!"
4,Caillou,"This review is rated highly because of how much my three year old loves Caillou. I didn't like Caillou initially because he's too whiny and I'm teaching my daughter th accept the things she cannot change. but then I noticed that she learnt that same lesson from watching Caillou and his mommy interact. I guess she apprecuiated the lesson more coming from her than me lol... I don't mind. All in all it's a good, educative and entertaining program with catchy tunes we both like to sing to.N"
1,YUCK,"I AM NOT A PICKY EATER, I LIKE THINGS THAT TASTE DIFFERENT. BUT THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!!! DO NOT BUY."
2,Possibly Harry's worst,"I've been a devoted fan of Harry Jr.'s music since heard him at Knickerbocker's in Greenwich Village many (6 ?) years ago. This is nowhere near his best. It's sort of Connick surreal. Not even remotely enjoyable! What was he trying to achieve? Whatever- it didn't quiote make it. Enhanced or not, I'd really like to use it as a saucer separator. Sorry Harry- I still think you're one of the greatest, but lose this one."
3,Some good music... but Star Turtles? Come on.,"Harry Connick is always trying to update his style and try new things. With this CD, he moves more towards a pop style, and achieves a good sound with ""Hear Me In the Harmony"" and others. The Star Turtle thread, however, is simply annoying and breaks up an otherwise enjoyable CD."
4,Targeted at people living in Japan rather than tourists,"Unlike most books which seem aimed at classroom study or tourists, it is aimed at people who will be living in Japan.It may also be of interest because of the customs described associated with weddings, funerals, gift-giving, and the like."
3,Star Wars Storybook Yoda Deluxe Child Costume,OK costume. The mask was a little smooshed but my six year old could care less. He loved it and I think he really believed he was Yoda! No complaints but nothing special either.
4,from theory to practice.,"A few years ago this book permitted me to go reliably fromtheoretical linear algebra to practical large-scale numericalcomputations, using also LAPACK. I think this is its place:from the university course level to the practical side.On the other hand, one cannot really say it is as readableas, say, Numerical Recipes: it has a quite terse style."
4,bible,"This book is a bible in matrix computation. While they have a lot of details on everything, though, the notations are rather complicated and hard-to-follow."
5,A great reference book for doing numerical analysis.,I recently bought this book and am amazed at how detailed the information is presented. This a great book for anyone doing numerical analysis on the computer. The details on how to work around ill-conditioned matrices is great.
3,Simple things explained in a too formal way,"The book is good, but it could have more useful examples and a less complicated text."
5,Refurbished Teac DC-D2831 Compact Stereo,"Just got this product refurbished today. I have owned 2 products exactly like it, a Samsung for 13 years (which this TEAC replaced) and a SONY for 7 years which still works fine. This was purchased for a home office to listen to CDs, LP Records, FM Radio, and play cassettes while I work. I am impressed by the turntable sound on old 78's and 33 LPs. True, it is not top of the line, but I bought this instead of $1000 of turntable, Cassette, CD, and Amplifier high quality stereo units. I think the product is fine, and have always been happy with other TEAC products. Time will tell."
2,I'M GONNA SCREAM!!,"No, no, no!!! Sam is DEAD! I am going to cry, seriously. After all this time it took for Gaia and Ed to get together after what happened in #20 (a book I could barely finish - I was seeing red). When Sam first died I wanted to cry and sop reading the series. I loved them together and reread all their scenes. I've always loved Ed, too, but when he got with Heather it seemed ok. Then Sam died and Gaia realizes how she feels about Ed... they seemed just PERFECT for each other. The two are best friends. They set each other off. Ed understands her psychotic personality and adores it. Why is Sam back? Why does Gaia want to go back to him? This series is becoming nothing more than something to cry over! Let can't we put it to rest? The only solution here is to put Gaia and Ed together and Sam find someone else. Finally. Once and for all. Then end the series happy. Sam happy. Heather happy. Gaia and Ed happy. EVERYONE happy! I just want Gaia and Ed together so much..."
5,"Hey, it works.","I suffer from anxiety. I try not to use prescription meds because I know too well of the consequences of dependency. I took one of these little sublingual tablets and felt a difference in about two minutes. I took a second one and it helped also. Wow, I did not expect it to work so well. I hope it continues to work. It is a Godsend."
2,Thomas Steam Set,"I gave this toy to my grandson for his fourth birthday. Eric said ""it was simply amazing."" My daughter said he played with it for several hours, which allowed her finish up some things she needed to do. Any boy who likes Thomas The Train will want the Steam Set."
3,"simplistic, naive, but well written","Steele writes well. His political analysis is fairly shallow, though, and the chapter that decribes in detail a near-future USA balkanizing along racial lines is hilarious - sort of survivalism for rightwing history geeks who've grown out of dressing up for civil-war re-enactments. If you want cogent analysis of racialist thinking, read the bell curve (which is just bad science rather than comically awful attempts at social analysis by someone with no training in the field...). If you want a summary of how the poorly-educated racists would sum up their views if they were as well-spoken as a California trial lawyer, this is the book."
2,Too sticky,"I've been a Seventh Generation fan for several years, so I was thrilled to see their line of feminine products in my local grocery store. This enthusiasm was short lived when, at the end of the day, I had several layers of sticky residue built up on my underwear. I hate wasting money, but I could not stand to deal with this inconvenience any longer than I had to. I picked up my usual brand and left this package in the women's locker room of my fitness center. Fortunately, I soon learned about the DivaCup from a relative, and I haven't looked back. I still like Seventh Generation's other products, but this one was definitely a bust."
4,Pads,"I was surprised that these pads were still white in color (as though bleached)...I thought they might have a light brown color to them like I've seen in other more natural pads. They are very very thin so not good for a heavy period as they do not hold much. Otherwise, comfortable and nicely packaged."
3,Good reading - Bad history,"If this story was actually true, I can see why the native American people distrust the whites. I wonder if it would have been different if we were here first, and the Indians discovered us?"
2,"Crescent Moon? That's a Stretch, Too. (2.5 Stars)","Well...she's back, and it's a comeback, but lyrically speaking, some songs aren't up to par-while others are crafted excellently. ""I Thought"" includes the line ""Called you my baby boo, yes I did"" with which I wasn't really impressed. But on others, like ""Anybody"" she sings ""I don't want anybody to know what we do alone"" and sings of other secretive matters. Lyrically, a standout track, but musically, it's not that great. In fact, besides ""What About Us?"" the bizarrely original track, and ""Full Moon"" the second of the singles released, not many of these songs are good musically. She's releasing anything worthy of a video that way, and the rest is filler.Is she trying to sound like all other black/bi-racial R&B singers, or did she create that flavor? That is up to you to decide.GRADE: C-BOTTOM LINE: Half Moon"
5,Brandy is the BEST!!!!!!! NO DOUBT!!!!!!!!!,"I'm Brandy's biggest #1 fan, no matter what anyone else says. Now, All of Brandy's albums were outstanding, especially NEVER SAY NEVER, but Brandy really out-did herself with FULL MOON. Brandy never fails to please me as a performer and as my idol and role model. There are no words to express how supurb this new album is. It's got new flava and everything!!!!! I encourage and urge everyone to purchase it. Please don't get it on bootleg, because that causes Brandy's album to lose money. I'm telling you the truth, It's worth every dime you pay for it and more!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Brandy cant sing.,"Save your ears..and dont buy this album, my ears have been permantly effected by Brandy's ""Full Moon""."
4,I love this album!,"I really love this album,I think this is the best one she done.Her voice is more vocally on this one too.Good job!Here's how i rate her songs..1.B Rocka Intro-2.Full Moon-4 stars3.I thought-4 1/2 stars4.When You Touch Me-5 stars5.Like This-3 1/2 stars6.All In Me-4 stars7.Apart-5 stars8.Can We-4 stars9.What about us?-4 stars10.AnyBody-3 stars11.Nothing-5 stars12.Its Not Worth It-3 stars13.He Is-5 stars14.Come A Alittle Closer-5 stars15.Love Wouldnt Count Me Out-5 stars16.Wow-5 stars17.Die Without You-3 1/2Tight album"
2,Disappionting!!!!! Not good for kids aged under 12!,"I was really disappointed with this movie. I love horses and was really excited to watch it, because it was rated G and therefore, I thought, less scary than the book, which I love. Well, I was watching it with my little sis, age 6, an she 1)couldn't understand the dialogue- I couldn't!-you need to be good with British accents- and 2) didn't understand what was happening. She went to bed and I watched the rest, telling her I would re-watch the rest with her in the morning. I'm glad I saw it first! They show dead horses, and there is upsetting animal abuse in it. Beauty goes to war, where a bunch of guys get stabbed-what the heck- and they throw in a slobbery romance. They did not focus on the horse at all, it was not very well made, and the only reason I give it two stars is because the horse was pretty, and the little boy and his horse theme in the beginning was cute.Should be rated PG-12, if that existed."
2,Disappointing and boring,"The cover of this album is really cool, but the music inside isn't as cool. I love early Echo & the Bunnymen, but they've been going downhill for the last 15 years. They were so unique and extraordinary in those early days. Today, a hundred bands could make product like the songs on this CD. If you like Echo & the Bunnymen for their first 3 or 4 albums, you may be disappointed by this one."
2,Poor lyrics.,"The music is great! However, I miss Ian's short, sometimes nonsensical, lyrics of the 80's. Now his words are squeezed in and leave nothing to the imagination. Ian, go back ""over the wall"" and ""bring on the dancing horses!"""
3,Where's Les Pattinson?,"Ian McCulloch has made fun of Les Pattinson's bass playing. He doesn't understand how important it was to the sound the band achieved from 1980-1985. Listen to those albums, and you will hear that the bass lines are very distinctive signatures on almost every song -- a key part of an amazing recipe. They were largely gone on the 1987 album, and they're entirely gone here. Without them, this is just a good pop band with good songs. Who needs them?"
3,Live Performance Matters Most............,"Echo and The Bunnymen were one of the greatest live bands that I had witnessed since they began to tour in the U.S. in 1981. I saw them twice in San Francisco that year-following up the ""Crocodiles"" release. U2 also began touring in 1980 & 1981 and these guys blew them and everyone else away. Before we bury them as too slick and washed up, see them on tour and decide. For the newcomers, ""Crocodiles"", ""Heaven Up Here"", and ""Echo & The Bunnymen"" are excellent recorded representations of the bands power. At times, the new album bristles with the shimmering guitarwork of Will Sergeant and the magic of Ian McCulloch. Not their best effort, but a large improvement over their last release. Typically, you have bands that are good in the studio, but can't cut it live. Live performance for me is what Rock and Roll is all about. Check them out............."
2,"Pretty Weak, Overall","Basically, Norris describes various killers and their crimes, and then goes on to make broad ""scientific"" statements about the psychology and biology of serial killers, without much real evidence at all. If you buy into the theory that webbed fingers and large earlobes are good predictors of psychopathic behavior, maybe this book is for you. Otherwise look elsewhere."
1,An average of 3 & 1/2 stars for a stinking movie like Termination Point?,"I don't expect a movie to destroy a real jumbo jet but the plane should NOT look like a toy on the screen either. It must be really hard for Jason Priestley and Lou Diamond Phillips to get acting jobs - to have to settle for this poor excuse for a movie. If I could, I'd give this movie a minus 5 stars!! I felt cheated for renting this turkey, I'd not watch this piece of you-know-what if it were free!!!"
3,hidden brilliance,"A brilliant and innovative thesis about the origins of genocide in Nazi Germany, but it is unfortunately presented in a very undigested form and without a captivating narrative. I hope someone will use this material in a more user-friendly manner."
1,Disappointing ...,"You already have an idea of what the movie is about. So here's my take on it.I was all set for some weird, wacky humor. I thought this might fit the bill, even though it was panned by the critics. Those critics, they have a stroke if the movie doesn't have some deep, hidden reference to post-Jungian etc. etc.Well, this time they were right.Strangely, the fantastical parts of this movie are the most tedious, suffering from slow pacing, although there are some interesting visuals. Doesn't really get that funny until Chris Kattan joins in, and that's too late in the game.A waste of time and money."
2,I chuckled once at the end at a Whoppi line...that's it!,"A friend of mine worked on the digital painting of MONKEYBONE so she asked me to watch it.Well?......her work was good!Brendan Fraser is a good looking guy, but a comedian he ain't! This film was soooooo not funny.There were two things I liked: (1) there is a great roller coaster that takes you to the land of death, and (2) Chris Kattan is the true ""physical"" comedian of this travesty, but has only 10 minutes of screen time towards the conclusion.Bridget Fonda? Totally forgetful role.Megan Mullaly is still ""Karen"" on WILL AND GRACE.Fraser? He was so good in the seriousGods and Monsters (Special Edition).Why does he do this kind of work?Whoopi Goldberg plays ""Death"".She made me laugh once at the end when she says ""I'll go after the guys at SOUTH PARK.I heard they want to meet me"".That's it! PASS"
2,Monkey-blah!,"I had high hopes for this flick. With a stellar cast of humorous actors and a laughable storyline, it should have been in the bag. However, the direction obviously got lost in the story telling. A cast that should have been able to work magic were given poor dialogue and even worse situation comedy. The storyline gets a little lost and half cocked. The puppetry is amazing and worth giving the movie a chance. I would suggest that you go in not expecting much."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!,I don't understand why people like this. The effects aren't that good and the characters are grating. This is going to make a very nice coaster.
2,"Good, yet unsatisfing....","Monkeybone has an interesting premise, but fails to fully follow up. The scenes in Downtown are fantastic, and the stop-motion on Monkeybone is great, but some of the acting skills are sub par. Chris Kattan was wasted in this film, having virtually no funny moments. Perhaps it was a blessing he was only in it for 15 minutes. McGowan's character of Kitty is fantastic, but her role is never really fleshed out as much as it could have been. Still, her moments in the movie are memorable. It is not a bad movie, but it is one that I would recommend renting first, as many will be dissapointed."
3,A little to odd so no repeat business here.,"We rented this one because it looked cute and had brendan fraser. Most of the family watched to the end and seemed to enjoy the movie, but there was NO REQUEST to rewatch it or buy it. It think the kids and my wife thought it was a little to odd and seeing it once was enough. Rent it before buying."
2,Not the MOST painful movie I've ever watched,"I like Brendan Frasier movies, most people won't admit that, but I think he is pretty funny. Monkeybone (movie and the character) were not funny at all. I'm also a big fan of Henry Selick's, but this looked like a collection of characters rejected from 'Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach'.The other reviews give you plot summary, so I won't repeat it here. And it actually sounds like a pretty interesting storyline, don't believe it. The saving grace of this movie was the performance by Chris Kattan. I'm not a huge fan, but Kattan was truly entertaining. My advice, stay away from this one. It tried to be weird and interesting, but was just plain dull."
5,I read it and NEED my children to read it!,"My older sister gave me this book for my birthday when I was a young child, and she was a teenager. We both loved it and read it over and over. I thought she still had the copy, she thought I had the copy, now we are desperate to share it with our children (and read it again ourselves) It is every bit as good as Harry Potter, probably better!"
4,Kinda Small,"This bag looks good but its kinda small( -1 star), both in fit and storage. Even with the strap fully extended it barely fits around me. Storage wise its good enough for carrying your phone/lunch to work - as for a full load of books or even sneakers/gym clothes, it would be a tight fit. But, for the looks and the price, you can make this work for you in some way"
3,At the Top of its Class,Without a doubt this album is fabulous. I already know all the words and I also tap dance to his music. This CD puts you in the best of spirts. It is too bad he is not recording anymore the man has so much talent.
2,Puttin on the Ritz - and thats about it,"Sorry, but no enchilada here. Taco's one and only hit still makes for sweet listening, but the rest of the collection is a flat, false and laughable fumble."
5,The Single Most Underappreciated Debut of the Nineties,"I saw this band perform in 1987 and subsequently bought their CD on the Columbia label. Even as it was released, it appears the label had put the project on the backburner. The Soundgardenesque sound at the time was being overshadowed by keyboard augmented hard rock (a la In the Meantime). Too bad. This disc contains several tracks that should have been massive rock hits including Blood Red Crush and Dissapear. The label can also be faulted for releasing the wrong lead off single in Download. This band rocks Soundgarden and STP at their aggressive, infectious best. The songs will become instant favorites and will leave you wondering how such a brilliant debut came and went without a sound."
2,bad signal,dont buy this gadget. it is bad choice and the quality of the signal is affull. alot static in the 4 frecuency
1,self destructed basically...,"Never buy this. It fell apart after a few weeks, the power button got jammed inside and the switch on the side fell in also. Then it stopped getting reception and I don't even use it anymore. It's a piece."
2,Noisy!,"A nice idea that doesn't provide adequate audio quality in my experience. The unit would pick up ""noise"" from the operation of my CD player, resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks. In addition, on trips I had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations."
2,Bad Design,"The iRock's sound quality is on par for most of these FM transmitters, they all sound bad. I was aware of the sound limitations when I bought the iRock, my big issue is the design and placement of the power button. It is set up in such a way if you put it in your glove box (or just about anywhere) you can guarantee something will press the power button and run down the batteries. Very frustrating. The iRock also limits you to only four station radio choices, 88.1, 88.3 etc. Since I live in Boston, a fairly large city with many, many colleges, those frequency are being used. So the iRock is useless for me when I am downtown. As soon as I get out of the city I'm fine. There has to be a better unit out there."
4,COC's best,"This album sees COC expanding on the southern-style groove metal formula they unveiled with 1994's ""Deliverance."" With ""Wiseblood,"" COC unveil a sound that is slightly more polished, but certainly not lacking in power. What sets this album apart from your typical metal album (especially now) is the sense of groove it brings to metal. This rhythmic quality is especially evident on my two favorite tracks on the album, ""Long Whip/Big America"" and ""The Door."" However, more traditional-minded metal fans won't be disappointed by this album, as hard rockers like ""Born again for the last time"" and ""Man or Ash"" keep things intense. Fans of more popular alterna-metal bands of the nineties (i.e., Soundgarden, Alice in Chains) should give this album a listen as well."
1,Poor Quality Copy,"I'm a fan of Jean Shepherd, but what I got was a bad CD that repeatedly rejected and skipped in my player. I'm very dissappointed."
2,This album shows how good SRV was,"The good thing about this album is it show how good SRV was. Unfortunately that is so because it is painful to listen to other artists playing his songs. The only artists to come out of this presentation with any credit are Dr. John for his 'Cold Shot', Bonnie Raitt for her slide work and Eric Clapton for 'Ain't gone'n give up on love'. The message of the album was 'we miss you stevie' which I can only echo after buying this album."
5,A fitting tribute,"This CD has the best blues musicians in the world paying tribute to SRV.Bonnie Raitt opens with a killer slide version of Pride and Joy,Jimmy Vaughn does a great version of Texas Flood second only to the version by Stevie.BB King does Telephone Song. Buddy Guy almost steals the show with Long Way From Home.Eric Clapton does a solid version on Aint Gonna Give Up On Love.Robert Cray does a strong version of Love Struck BabyThis is a fitting tribute of musicians who are honoring SRV along with SRV's former band members.This is a must for any SRV fan, or any blues fan............"
4,"Really Good, but Ain't Great","A good tribute to SRV by many of his peers, but with a few embarrassing moments. His brother Jimmy sounds horrible. Sounds like he has tin strings on his guitar with equally bad vocals. I am also totally disgusted with the SRV jam at the end. It is so repetitious and boring that SRV would be ashamed to have his name attached to it. It lacks any of the creativity and fluidity that were his hallmark."
1,Yuck-Don't Waste Your Time (or Money!!!),"This book was without a doubt the worst book I've read in a long time. Having read Bridget Jones's diary and loved it, I was expecting to enjoy this one also. I finished the book and asked myself, ""What exactly was the book about?"""
2,Confessions of a sociopathic social climber,"I was really hoping to like this book, but i couldn't get into it. The pages are basicly about the same thing after same thing. Don't waste your time, buy a different book."
2,I couldn't pick this book up.,"I had a very difficult time getting through this book. I had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Although Katya's thoughts and actions did make me laugh out loud a few times, I had a hard time caring about what happened to her. This may be why I found myself reading the same page over and over, and still my mind wandered."
3,I really like this book,"When I first began this book, I really hated the main character. The further I got in the book, the more I like it and the funnier it got to me. I think the author went for broke and achieved it quite well. Katya is suppose to be mean and nasty. She is suppose to be unlike- even hated. But I think if some of us would remember our first reaction to people around us, we would see we are not that different. I though this book was refreshing and it was a nice change to hate the heroine and love her at the same time."
2,Ho Hum,"I had to reread and reread pages over and over. It was not my sense of humor, and I found the main character rather boring. I can see where maybe anyone from the UK might like the book, but definately not US humor used."
3,Understandably friendless,"Written in the vein of ""Bridget Jones Diary"" this diary entry book follows one year in the life of a very unlikable character, Katya. Katya believes she is better than all her acquaintances and will stop at nothing in pursuit of fame and fortune. Whilst smoking and drinking her way through the year, she manages to secure several interesting occupations, none of which satisfy her greediness. This book is a fast read, somewhat amusing and you'll find yourself sympathizing with her ""friends,"" most of which cannot stand her."
1,waste of time,I bought this book in audio format to listen to on a long car ride and fell asleep every time we put the tape in (good thing I wasn't driving).There are a few funny lines in the story but there is absolutely no plot. The book is in diary format and if you scramble the days around it wouldn't really matter because nothing happens and the character doesn't change one bit. It's just a ridiculous waste of time and money.
4,Loved it!,I LOVED this book! Slow to start but well worth it. I would have gotten to the end much faster if I had not been stopped so much to tell the people around me what I was laughing at. A must read for any bad girl out there.
5,A MUST READ,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK. WELL WRITTEN AND EASY TO READ. HELPS ANSWER MANY OF THOSE INNER LIFE QUESTIONS WE ALL ARE SEARCHING FOR. A MUST FOR ANY BOOKSHELF.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO EVERYONE.
3,el envío fue eterno,duro mucho en llegar tube que rastrearlo despues de 15 dias de aver sido enviado a mexico fue muy tardado el envio
3,Sound track volume,Video quality is acceptable ( B&W ) but sound track is barely audible at maximum volume on a std.def.DVD player. The sound quality was much improved on a Blu-ray player.
4,Superman the 1948 & 1950 Theatrical Serial Collection,I love this movie and i loves this packaging. Digipack with 4 disc and have slip boxset. But i don't why this edition not included subtitles english. I must make louder speaker to understand the movie.
3,The early series,If your really into Superman then you have to have this dvd in your collection. Its a bit corny compared to what we see these days on the big screne but for its time it was great viewing. I had it on VHS but these days you have to have everything on DVD. Much better viewing
5,SUPERMAN SERIALS,Superman - The 1948 & 1950 Theatrical Serials CollectionGREAT PRODUCT JUST WHAT I WANTED TO ADD TO MY COLLECTIONTAHNKS
4,Just what I expected,"I grew up with George Reeves as the man of steel so I really got this to add to my Superman collection. It was okay as 1940,s serials go but the cartoon flying segments was something to get use to. All in all it was great. Full of action and adventure.I,m very pleased."
5,"A "" Must Have"" For Collectors......","History on film, on DVD. If you like the genre, and appreciate the old classic's, you will appreciate this collection. When you watch them, it's like a time capsule taking you back to the 1950's. You feel like your Sitting in the old Strand Theater waiting for the feature presentation. A must have for collectors."
5,Amazing True Crime Story,"Once you begin reading this amazing story about one of the youngest serial murderers in the country, you won't put it down!"
3,WHY?,"This book is a very good entrant - but it is nowhere near the in-depth study as *In Cold Blood* - Truman Capote's book that started the true crime genre.Jon Dunkle is a chilling person of whom we are never really told the *WHY* - of him or his actions. Although the author is titled ""M.S.W."" (recipient of a Master's degree in Social Work) that expertise or potential insight is never realized in this book. There are a few allusions to family problems in Jon's early childhood - but they are not followed through.WHY? Why would a ""boy next door"" do these awful things? In the end, we are left with the conundrum: is Dunkle psychotic or malingering (e.g. rendering a ""performance of insanity"") to avoid the consequences of his actions?"
5,I was very happy!,"I was very happy to see that they included the game Sonic 3 and Knuckles, which was one of my favorites! If your a sonic fan you'll love this game and will remind you of your old sonic games sitting around in a box somewhere."
4,wonderful,"when my son used this book,he loved it,he didnt wanna burn it,he usually does,but he just loved it,definately worth buying,this book is wonderful and not meant to be thrown in a bonfire"
2,"Good Actors, Bad Plot","Gilly, a dog-catcher, meets Jo, a ditzy hairdresser, the girl of his dreams. Everything seems to be going right until we find out that the lovebirds share the same parents. (!)There are some great actors here and some really funny scenes (kudos to Orlando Jones), but too much gross slapstick and incest jokes for this audience member. If seeing Heather Graham cut Chris Klein's ear off and stab him with scissors doesn't bother you, then maybe seeing Chris Klein with his arm stuck inside a cow's rear end will. All in all, it was too gross to be good."
1,The WORST movie I've ever seen!!!,"Yet another 'family time' movie I was forced to endure, Say it isn't So made the movie, Where the Buffalo Roam look like a masterpiece. This was a horrid, frightful movie! First of all, I didn't laugh once, and I am easily amused. They tried to be funny and all, but I couldn't see what was so 'hilarious' about this unredeemable piece of crap. Once again, Chris Klein plays the sweet, naive guy he always seems to play. And once again, he falls for some equally dumb chick and their love is tested by some predicament (Leelee with her illness; Mena and the choir vs. playing lacross with his buddies). But eventually, they'll overcome all odds, but not before going through a bunch of ridiculous 'issues' and live happily ever after. This was just awful - it was an insult to trailer park people. I hated, hated, HATED this movie! Grrr!I'm done now. Just don't see this movie. I almost blinded myself after watching this."
1,SAY IT ISN'T SALLY FIELDS HERE....,"Well, this movie is mean, man. Another badly tasted, poor conducted comedy (it seems to me the fashion nowadays). And, worse of all, to watch Sally Fields in it was a real pain in my heart... I could not believe it...ENough."
1,Al Gore is his own worst enemy,"Seriously, this guy comes out with his ridiculous speeches, tried to steal the last election (but was defeated thank God) and now wants to talk about values???? C'mon. I guess Bill Clinton's book on moral values and strong fidelity comes out next right?I flipped through the book at our book store. There were plenty of copies. No big rush from anyone to buy it.Al, you did it to yourself guy."
1,"Confusing, very dissorganized","This book jumps around so much that I feel that I am playing hopscotch. It's a classic case of throw some spaghetti against the way and hopefully some of it will stick. Gore seems to be desperately trying to grab at anythingto get the readers hooked...but alas, Gore fails terribly."
1,Bad product,"Failed after 2 months. This is the second time I had one fail . First time I thought is was me, now I know. Going back to the old time."
5,Great reference for Non-Medical Practioners,"Having family members with health issues as well as myself, I have found this book to be invaluable. It is easy to comprehend and search through. If you are taking a specific class of medications, they are all grouped together in the same class, and you can look at which medications in that particular class may have less side effects than others. I never go to my doctor's office without this book in my bag. Sometimes doctors can't keep up with all the data, and he appreciates me being on my toes.This book is a MUST for anyone who has one or more medical issues."
4,Does the job...in pro way.,Not sure I really needed these but I wanted to try them.Typically I will tin the ends of the speaker wire with solder...to preventing fraying etc.
5,!!!STRATEGY GUIDE IS GREAT!!!,"The picture's are great to look at and easy to read and the maps are helpful too. You sould't use the guide book to much because the game well be to easy for you use the book time to time for some of the hard level's ahead ok.The book give's you the music guide. It also gives you the heart's and where are they hidding at.SO GO LUCK YOU GOING TO NEED IT.It's a great book to own I have I and I like it.That book can help people if they are not good at these games HEY! I have to get the book too so don't feel lift out ok.The book show's you neverthing you need to know you name it, it's in there, so have fun I did.The book show's you the tool's and the places that you are going later in the game you got to do one level at a time don't worry be happy because you or don't have the book. at last you got the game right???I wish they made games like this form now on don't you think??Well, go enjoy yourself I am are you."
4,Same old good hash!,"It's just another one of those compilations which will only look good if you're an intensely obsessed Donna Summer collector. Otherwise, you'll be more than adequate having her anthology album. This is the sixth compilation I have of pretty much the same songs--Enough is Enough! Now, where's that new album she's been promising us since 99? The reason this made four stars, in my opinion, is simply because the sound quality is exquisite-- a true rarity with German-pressed CDs; but, note that this is most definitely not the ideal compilation to have of Donna. Actually, it's too daunting to compress her range in a single 'best of' album. It simply can't be done."
1,waste of money! go to walmart!,They fell part in less then a week there crap made for a dime sold way over what they should be I might as well have whiped my a** with the ten I spent on this crap go to walmart get real ones for same price these suck!
5,Favorite toy!,"My one year old twins love this toy. This is the one they fight over. It was given to us as a gift. I'm not sure why other people say that it doesn't turn off. There is an off switch and it works. If you don't turn it off, it will shut off eventually, but when you move it, it will turn back on. The kids love to push the balls down through the top. It can either sing a song or talk. It has a long string on it to pull it around. I bought them a different airplane toy and they never play with it. This is a definite buy. I'll be buying it for gifts!"
5,1 year old loves it!,"My son got this for his first birthday and loves it! He plays with it for long stretches of time - it isn't very common for a toy to hold his attention for as long as this one does! The balls are the perfect size for little hands and he can get them in the top of the helicopter with a little effort. He loves putting the balls in the helicopter and taking them out over and over again. This toy also has lots of fun buttons to press. There is a little dog pilot on the front that you can press and he barks, there are 3 piano key style buttons and say letters, colors, animals, numbers or play a tune, and 3 different settings on the side of the helicopter as well. The helicopter blades also turn and make noise. The string is a great feature too since my son loves to pull things around. Great toy, sounds and music are not annoying, durable and holds my sons attention. Highly recommend!"
2,Never shuts off!,"Mu son received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. This toy never shuts off. There's a switch and you would think that the middle position, which is a solid circle, would be for shutting the contraption off. But no, it has to shut off itself and God forbid you should, move, bump, pick it up to put away, breathe too hard etc... it will just come alive all over again. This thing has gone off at night when I try to put it away or literally when I touch it. I like toys that can be turned off. Lastly, just when you think its done talking it just keeps going lol."
2,My First (and Last) Dino Dig Kit,"You need a lot of patience and time (100 years might be enough). First of all, the glow-in-the-dark skeleton would not go together (we've put together many other dino skeletons) so we gave up on that. Next, my 8 year old grandson & I did not find it rewarding to peck away at a hard lump and rarely find a ""bone"". To speed things up, I used a screwdriver--we got to the point where we'd be happy just to find a few bones. By the time we were done ""digging"" we realized there was no way this thing would stay together even with super glue. This granny is done with dinosaur digging kits!"
3,"Fun if you want to learn, not if you want to be entertained.","A lot like a textbook, but if you don't know much about Thailand, this sure would entertain you quite well. The simple language might get in the way a little bit. Then again, being written in a second language for an audience who are not familiar with Thai culture, you've got to give the man a break.The movie is being made. And now CBS's Survivor is going to this island as their next destination. :)"
3,Not the Best Cast,"I am very familiar with three different casts for Lucy Simon's ""Secret Garden"", the Original Broadway Cast, with Daisy Eagan and Patinkin; the Aussie Cast, with Anthony Warlow and Philip Quast (both of Les Mis fame); and this, the London Cast.Honestly, of the three, this is my least favourite. Were I to create a dream cast, I would add John Cameron Mitchell, Luker, and Eagan to the Aussie cast. While I loved Quast in this, Mary was too ""American Idol"" for me, and Luker's oddly haunting lilt was lacking. Eagan's petulance and fundamental ""childishness"" was also abscent. While this version more closely tracks the book, it lacks in many other areas. If you want the book; buy the book or the motion picture. If you want the show; go with the American or Aussie versions (though the Aussie cast can be difficult to find)."
3,sizing is an issue.,I wanted this for one of my cats but it's too small. This is for a medium size cat. Mine is 15 pounds. Will keep since it does fit my other cats. This needs to have a description on how to measure for your specific cat. Couldn't even find that information on other websites that sell this product.
3,Okay for occasional use,"I originally bought this for my cat when taking her through the airport. It worked for that, although I think she was so scared she wouldn't have run off anyway. We tried a few walks but she was able to get out of the harness a couple times, so it just wasn't worth it."
2,exactly what you paid for,"The heat outside/inside vent door does not shut all the way, and the filter as many have pointed out is cheaply made at best. The price should and does reflect on the quality of the product. I would have loved the outside vent feature to have a filter as well and lack of one is the biggest disappointment."
3,"OK, but not helpful for me","I bought this book because the table of contents looked good and it had so many 5-star reviews. However, after reading it cover-to-cover I did not find it very helpful for my particular situation. I lost both my parents when a drunk boater hit them (they were in knee deep water and he came ashore at full speed). While this book acknowledges the extra feelings that come from sudden loss, it does not address the complex images left after a violent homicide, and dealing with the drawn-out legal process.Also, none of the self-help suggestions were appealing or really plausable for me ... I stay home with 3 kids age 3 and under, and I can't go out and shout in a forest or get into aromatherapy."
2,Review,"The book was more geared to people who lose those close to them suddenly, i.e., accident, etc. I was looking for something more on terms with death caused from illness."
2,cheap construction,product corner broke and plastic is brittle and cheap. cover does not fit properly. does heat ok. not as expected
3,Read the description.,"Got this for a black lab that sleeps in a plastic 55gallon barrel house, laid on its side, 1/4 the way filled with hay. I did not realize when I bought this that it is rigid. When I thought of the words ""plastic mat"", I was thinking it was a flexible plastic, sort of like a normal heating pad/seed starting mat would be....but it is not. It will not fit correctly in my dog's doghouse, so I cut a section out of the bottom of her house large enough to fit over the mat, placed the mat on floor, and her barrel over it. It's ""ok""...but with her other bedding in there, if she doesn't lay exactly on top of the mat itself, the little bit of hay disperses her weight enough that the mat never really warms up. I'm not a fan of this mat for my situation, and wish the word ""rigid"" was added to the word ""mat"". If it had been, I would have ordered something different."
2,My First Real Disappointing Amelia Peabody Book,"I just did not like this book, it just did not have much of a point. Even the usual witty repartee between Amelia and Emerson wasn't enough to salvage this book for me. The whole plot seems pointless with Amelia and Emerson just meandering around Egypt's various famous archaeological sites. As much as I hate to admit it, I really missed Ramses, and that whole England bit was far too boring. Let's hope the next book redeems the series for me."
4,Park the Kids and Find Your Man,"Elizabeth Peters parks the kids in England and kindles Amelia's love life in THE SNAKE, THE CROCODILE & THE DOG. Well, the best laid plans do not always work or do they.To enjoy this title in the series it helps to be familiar with the Emerson's history as a couple and their relationship to various secondary characters.Amelia and ""Father of Curses,"" who dislikes his first name have some time to enjoy each other during the winter dig in Egypt. Then old friends, villains in disguise as friends, dead bodies, stolen artifacts, beautiful slave women, and mayhem make their way on to the stage.The pace is fast and secrets impeded the action, which makes this one of the funnest books in the series. A delightful visit with an old friend.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
1,DVD Delicatessen,Product never received and price charged will be deducted from AMEX card.You have been notified last week on this matter
5,Magnificient,"I only saw the latter part of the movie but I was hooked. The movie reminds me of the 'City of lost children' from the same directors but this one is done with more of the tongue in the cheek attitude. COULD THE STUDIO HAVE THIS MOVIE RELEASED ON DVD FORMAT, PLEASE"
1,Don't waste your time!,"Faut-il tre un critique de cinéma pour apprécier ce film ? A croire que oui !Un film on ne peut plus glauque, lugubre, sinistre, malsain, une ""histoire"" miteuse.En bref : une perte de temps considérable."
1,"Cannibal movie, where's the gore?","For anyone thinking of buying this movie, I was fooled into believing it was a horror film or at least a horror comedy. It is neither funny or scary. I don't know what to call this mess, because their is no gore in the picture. I think that an apartment building appearing normal during the apocalypse is a funny idea. But that's about it. This picture is also too abstract for my tastes. It really doesn't make much sense. I can make more sense out of a Lucifer Valentine movie than this. And that's pretty abstract!"
5,great piece of french cinema,Delicatessen is a great film by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Just the right amount of morbid humor. I highly recommend this to anyone that appreciates international cinema.
5,Awesome,"I got this as a birthday present for my dad and he loved it. Added bonus, my mom liked it too, and she hated City of Lost Children so I wasn't expecting it. Highly recommend this for anyone except small children, I can see it being kinda creepy to a kid."
2,Little substance but OK hero and heroine,"While I liked some of the interplay with Emily and Luke, for the most part this story left me feeling empty. Cora is the only source of conflict and once she moves out of the house there is absolutely nothing keeping the two main characters apart. All the problems that do pop up are too predictable leaving few if any surprises. While both Luke and Emily had sad and interesting pasts, it would seem that two strangers living under the same roof would have more difficulties before coming together. Their romance progressed too easily and seemed unrealistic. Another thing that bothered me was the way some scenes didn't seem to flow and felt more like they were there as padding--giving a ""tacked on"" feeling. The one thing it has going for it is some very good descriptive writing, now if the author could just manage to combine her strong writing style with a better plot."
4,JAGUAR HUNTING,"A real classic of its kind. The author, Tony Almeida has hunted more Jaguars than Sasha Siemel during a period when Jaguars were plenty and bothersom to cattle owners in Matto Grosso and Bolivia. Things are changed now, dramatically, as over hunting resulted in near extinction of this beautiful cat which is now protected throughout its habitat.This book is a reprint of the original published years ago in softcover format."
3,"It's not *bad*, really...","Do you remember that mega-hit from _Cable Guy_, ""Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth With Money In My Hand""? DO NOT buy this album just for that song--none of the others come close to matching it, and I suspect it was mixed by somebody else. The other stuff is vaguely catchy, but overall mediocre. ""Rocket"" is entertaining, ""Are You Happy"" is interesting, and ""Motherfucker"" is thought-provoking; but the rest--like ""Oo-Mau"" and ""Woman"" are cliched and forgettable. Ah well, you win some, you lose some...let's see if PRG becomes another one-hit-wonder band, or if they manage to pull something worthwhile to follow up the initial boom."
3,Not As Bad As I Thought,"When I heard Stand Outside A Phone Booth..., I wanted to throw up...it was that bad...but I saw Rocket in the Columbia House bargain bin and decided to get it for the fun of it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the rest of the album was much louder and grungier...more to my tastes...I can't help but wonder why he released Phone Booth as the single if he planned the rest of the album in this manner though..."
3,"I cannot say that I disliked it, but...","I have to say at the onset that I have religous issues with this book. I am a witch and representation of pagans in this book bothered me. Come to think about it, the author also did a number on both fundamentalist and liberal Christians as well. Still, he is allowed some artistic licence.The problems I had with the actual composition are the following: a) I could not figure out what had happened except in the most broad sense; would it have hurt the author to give a more comprehensible explination? b) There were at least half a dozen charactes in the book that to my eyes did nothing to further the plot.What I liked about the book: a)the Angel; b)the Professor; c)the biting sarcasm about the future of liberalism. Also the plot is fairy twisted and action packed and the mythology is nicely woven in.I had borrowed this book from the library and do not recommend spending any money on it."
4,The original and best.,"A very enjoyable version of this 'rock opera', recorded before the show was smoothed out and the score was watered down for its stage debut. Julie Covington brings the appropriate levels of bitchiness and diva bravado to the title role, and ""C.T."" (Colm) Wilkinson shows us a very different, rougher side of his voice than that from his Les Miz perfomance. Recording quality is good, with a sound very similar to Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar concept album (low production, more of a rock guitar sound). Probably not ""the"" Evita recording (Patti LuPone's B-Way cast album will no doubt retain that title), but personally I enjoy this recording more, simply because it sounds more like a Rock Opera and less like an Andrew Lloyd Webber spectacle."
1,THE WORST RECORDING EVER MADE!!!!!!,"this cd is a complete disgrace to evita. Julie Covington is an awful Eva Peron. If evita was alive today, she'd want to die! Covington makes my mom sound like an opera singer. C.T Wilconson, before his Lez miz days,turns in a HORRIBLE proformance The only song he does well on is ""Oh what a circus"" Paul Jones is a flat, boring Peron. The only thing good abount this recording is the band. Bottom line, dont waste your money.I recament the Primire american recording, Patti Lupone And Mandy Patinkin turn in much better proformances, plus it's a more compleate version"
2,rhino's version is significantly different from the original,"terribly disappointed to find that rhino has used the title of the original release without using the same material. the secret policeman series is taken from a number of live benefit performances for amnesty international. each of the releases has some overlap with the others. notably absent from this version, as compared to the original, are the pete townshend acoustic version of ""pinball wizard"" and the ""two men on a bench"" skit performed by john cleese and peter cook. on the other hand, it does include the eric clapton/jeff beck collaboration."
4,The Secret Policeman's Ball [1979] [UPC 9322225009066],"This is a PAL DVD Region 4 [Australia] made by Umbrella Entertainment/Amnesty International DAVID0006.Peter Cook, John Cleese, Clive James, Eleanor Bron, Pete Townshend, Rowan Atkinson, Michael Palin, John Williams, Ken Campbell, David Rappaport, Sylvester McCoy, Terry Jones, Tom Robinson"
2,"Staring, Mumling, Incoherent Trash","Like many movies of the 21st century, this one is unwatchable. I agree with the reviewer who said he/she kept looking at the clock to see how much more of this junk would be shown. The actors spend large segments of time just staring at each other, supposedly with meaningful expressions, but really rather expressionless. Their faces usually show vacuity instead of emotion (which is supposed to be imagined and supplied by teeny watchers). When they actually speak a few words, they mumble in low, almost inaudible sounds. The grandfather's accent my be unintelligible, but the other actors speak as if no one is supposed to hear them. Like TV, Hollywood's movies have fallen to the lowest common denominator."
4,"""The Dust Factory""","A very imaginative fantasy, with a lot of appeal to all young and/or young at heart. I saw the movie presented of TV and decided it was worthy adding to our collection of mostly classic movie DVD's. The plot is easy to follow - but for you to find out if you should chose to buy this DVD. Suffices to say that, in all probablity, you will not be disappointed."
2,Too Slow,I was very disappointed in this movie. I thought it was slow moving and found myself contunually calling up the display to see how much longer it lasted. The Grandfather has such a heavy accent that I missed a lot of what he was saying but didn't want to drag out the movie by playing it back. I have seen many fantasies in my time but this one left me cold. Didn't like! I was sure glad I had gotten it from the library and not bought it.
4,"Simple and effective. Do take note of how the device is aligned, though.","The item seems well built and is from a name that I personally trust.There are a few things to take note of, though:1. This item does not come with all of the bells and whistles that other surge outlets come with. This simply has a Reset/Off switch, and that's it.2. The power outlet slots for this device are aligned to go down the strip vertically. This may be an issue if more than one of your adapters are bricks/blocks, as they will fully take up the space of this, fairly short, power strip.Otherwise, I am definitely happy with the money I have spent on this."
4,"Quality product,great guarantee,great price","This power strip will do everything you need it to do, and is backed by a $15,000 dollar guarantee. What more could you ask for? Well, nothing at this price point. However,I would love to have the on/off switch on top and lighted,rather than by the cord and harder to access. Also harder to tell,depending on what you have connected, if it''s on or off.Hence the four stars instead of five. I have purchased six of these so far and need more. lol....If there is a power outage I try to unplug everything until the grid is stable again. But if the worst were to happen, I have Belkin's guarantee for connected equipment.Whether I, as Joe consumer could actually collect, is another matter. Hope to never find out."
5,sleep comfort,I spray this all over my bed befor I go to sleep and it really helps. I actually look forward to going to sleep at night so I can be blanketed by this beautiful scent that takes me to dreamland. Just dreamy!!
5,Black Stallion,"It is a touching story about a boy, a horse, and a passion . A strong passion, a very strong passion."
5,The Start of Something Wonderful,The first book in a series of truly great horse stories. This magical black stallion captures the heart of everyone and simply draws you in for the adventures of him and his offspring in the many books that follow. Walter Farley blessed us truly with The Black Stallion. Thank You
