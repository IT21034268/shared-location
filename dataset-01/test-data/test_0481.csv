1,Warning: DO NOT BUY the ProForm 320,"Warning: DO NOT BUY the ProForm 320. I am a man of upper avg. weight (215 lbs) and bought the ProForm 320 in hopes to cut down my weight. 3 months after purchasing this product direct from Sears, the left support beam failed (whilst exercising) and broke from its previously welded position on the flywheel. Knowing that any warranty coverage would only buy be 3 months more time before the next machine failure, I opted to have my father weld the support beam back in place, which held up....until the RIGHT foot support beam broke 3 weeks later. I had that one welded as well thinking I was out of the woods...WRONG. a month after that, the right inner support beam broke straight off the axle. After that, I gave up and burned the damn thing straight to hell in a bonfire behind my dad's storage unit. Cheap parts = DONT BUY! Make sure to ask before u buy where these products are made, and if they are sturdy. Whoever made this contraption should be calling a lawyer."
3,An amusing addition to the bedside table,"While reasonably entertaining, there's a definite lack of content in this book. It offers little explanation of the author's reasoning (there wasn't any introduction describing any sort of background). It's very pretty, though."
2,It took a controversey to make anyone read this one,"When this poem came out, there was a lot of controversy. Not only because of the content, but because New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey had named Amiri Baraka as the state's poet laureate shortly before, and the subsequent outrage over the poem prompted the state to rescind that title from Baraka.Some believe Mr. Baraka (AKA Leroy Jones) was blaming the Jews in his poem ""Somebody Blew Up America"" for the 9-11 attack on the Twin Towers. After reading the poem, I understand Baraka's point that he was not blaming Jews, but rather ISRAELIS.That being said, the only reason anyone bothered to read this book and its poems was because of the controversy. It's not a great of a read at all."
2,Very Hammy,"The premise of this movie can be seen in just about any nightly news cast. ""Take down your Chrisymas Trees, no Jesus in class rooms"" That kind of thing. Movie was slow and boring. Everyone and everything was just perfect. I mean no trash in the streets, no dust in the garage,kitchen table that looks just perfect. I mean give me a break. Unless you want to just see a polital type movie, save your money. The old Christmas movies are still the best."
5,Last Ounce of Courage,"This Movie is a Must See for All Families in the United States of America! It Praises Jesus Christ as Jesus Birthday on Every December 25th! Jesus Christ is King on kings and Lord of lords! Buy This Movie today and Share it with Everyone you know!We Need to Protect our Freedom in the USA Now!!! I was crying when I was watching this Movie! I Even Asked Jesus Christ to forgive me again as my pride always stops me from Who I Should Love and Follow, and My Father in Heaven Jesus Christ!God Bless the USA, God Bless Our Vet'sLove in Jesus Christ, \o/ YSICKristi Jorgensen"
4,Everyone needs to see this movie,The content and message of this movie is something everyone needs to see. I really wish it was coming out before Thanksgiving so we could show it on Thanksgiving day to the family. Our religious freedoms are being eroded and our way of life is vanishing before our eyes..
5,Awesome movie,I appreciate that you got this to me very quickly. I would also say this is a must see.I really enjoyed this movie.
1,Nice piano transcriptions....lackluster performance with too many abrupt sloppy key changes,"Robert Schultz's piano transcriptions of excellent orchestral, operatic and chamber pieces is excellent.However, his vision is lost in translation by Faigen who seems too hurried with her lackluster performance which tends to be overshadowed by her many abrupt and sloppy key changes.Take note of Track#14 - Canon in D, it appears 1:12 mins her attempt to build on the expressiveness of the transcriptions is interrupted with her missing the right chords.I would seek out alternatives such as the one by Tim O'Neil. Leave this disc in the recycle bin or better yet, in the CD shredder. Very disappointed."
4,Great camera cover,This rain protector is in keeping with the quality of Kata's other products that I own - solidly built and functional.
2,Good Production--ripoff price!,"35 bucks for a 3 hour documentary! Please. Some good stuff though, esp. when the family talks about the insight to some Hendrix lyrics. I never heard that before. It is unauthorized so of course it doesnt have any Hendrix music. Buy it used, I would have added two stars if they sold it for 20 dollars because it goes into a lot of detail and has some great intervieews and was overall a good production."
4,Helpful for all the details,"If you are looking for a book to teach you how to teach, this ain't it. But if you are looking for something comprehensive that discusses all the many aspects one must consider to plan and execute a quality program, this is a gem. If you do much sponsoring of programs and events, you know it is the little things that can ruin your day: the air conditioner is not working, you did not adequately budget for the materials needed, you did not anticipate the needs of the participants, etc. This helps prevent geting blindsided. I refer to this frequently when preparing workshops and programs, and recommend it to others."
1,BEWARE - NO PAGE NUMBERS IN KINDLE VERSION!!!,"I'm highly disappointed in Amazon for not being upfront about the lack of page numbers in their e-textbooks... both of the eTexts I purchased for grad school do NOT have page numbers! If you plan on using this text for coursework, DO NOT buy the Kindle version - it will be near impossible for you to follow along if the professor assigns specific page numbers and near impossible for anyone to research your citations unless they purchase the Kindle version too."
3,bad batteries,I just bought a milwaukee cordless drill 18v. It worked good for about the first three months. After that it rapidly started to decline in performance. I am caught inbetween a rock and a hard place cuz I don't know if I want to buy the battery witch may be a flunk or just buy a different drill. My drill right now is totally out of commission. I dont know if its the batteries or what but I know that they should not be going out that quickly. I use mine everyday as sheet metal mechanic so I guess I need a drill that is a little more professional than Milwaukee.
2,Over priced and didn't last for me,"When I first purchased my Milwaukee 18 volt drill (from wonderful Amazon) with 2 batteries less than 2 years ago I was a happy camper as both the drill and the batteries gave me good service.However after having used the drill quite a bit initially for only about 3 months and after that using it very little for the other 21 months BOTH of the expensive Milwaukee batteries now won't hold much of a charge for drilling more than one hole. I'm junking these babies out and won't come back to Milwaukee.There are plenty of other brands of drills and batteries also made in China that cost a lot less and do the same thing and last longer and so although Milwaukee used to be a quality brand made in America that I loved for 30 years based on the durability of these expensive 18volt batteries I'm no longer paying extra for Milwaukee brand of now ""made in China"" products."
3,So So battery,"I bought two batteries. One died after a couple of weeks. I sent it back and got a new one. It could just be my imagination, but these batteries don't seem to last any longer then my NiCad batteries. When the batteries get low on power they completely switch off, with no warning. One second your drill is working, the next it's completely dead. This is extremely annoying! I had high hopes for these batteries..., not so much."
3,American Houses,"Two former editors at Architecture have selected 21 recent houses that offer a promising vision, in their frugality or inventiveness, for the future of residential architecture. They are scattered around the United States-often in unfamiliar locations-Canada, and Mexico. There's no overarching message beyond Ho's lament that so few can afford a house like these, leaving the rest little beyond the retro offerings of home builders."
5,Leather dog lead,This Lead is very strong which is desirable for my Airedale Terrier; my prior leather lead was dependent upon a rivet at a critical point--this one is amply sewed at that critical point.
1,HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?,"I'm still wondering how in the world Hollywood's two of the best stars got into this terrible mess! What a waste! Charlie & Marvin fans should stay away from this one. Regardless of the reviews that I read from IMDB I bought this DVD last year & I'm still regreting it. Take my advise, keep this away from your collection."
4,"quite a fun, but not stuff for a single book","I really enjoyed reading this book. It is worth, but contains only small amount of information. You may find the entire contents in the book could be written as a couple of chapters. However, the CD was absolutely useful."
2,ONLY FOR BEGINNERS!!!!!!!,This book is only for beginners who don't know anything about Electric guitar effects.... else skip it... buy a effects cookbook.. will be better...
3,Cheaper then buying it from the Gov't.!,"Though it is a technical government publication and much of the material is outdated, this book has all of the basics on the Americans with Disabilities Act. Boring: but a must have resource. Thomas Schmokel - ADA Consultant - ADA-Experts.com"
3,Not realistic,If you have a vivid imagination then this is the book for you. But if you are an avid reader this book came off as a bit much. I know an author is suppose to use their imagination but this was a bit much. It interesting reading but I did not think it had much substance. Ms. Berry could have thought this out a little bit more and did some more research on the subject. Some the scenes in the book were unrealistic to say the least.
2,bizarre,"This book was really far-fetched. If you are the type of person who reads a lot, and enjoys a book that you will not want to put down, (then you might want to read this one when you have absolutely nothing else to read).However, I am a firm believer that you may not like the messengerbut there is a message in everything.Some things that one may ponder after reading the book might be:1. Faith, ""do you really have it""2. The grass always looks greener on the other side, sometimes your mate is the one for you.3. We give power to certain things in our lifes, We are the only ones who can dismiss the power and not be haunted by it.4. We can probally write a book if we really wanted too.. (smile)"
2,"Hard to finish, (2 stars I'm bringing generous)","Ok read ""Hovoc after Dark"" amesome book, loved every minute of it, it was like crack, I wanted another hit! so I got this book........do yourself a favor rent the movie ""Bridges of Madison County"" or ""Broke Back Mountian"" you'll enjoy it a lot better, lifes too short for this type of [...]"
4,Ink cartridge review: Epson T0601,"It works in my printer. Delivery was a couple of days more than I expected, but the arrival time wasn't critical to me. Overall I'd order this product from this source at this price again."
5,hole in the wall,I first heard this in milwaukee and enjoyed it. Has a good beat for dancing. Although I was sitting down at the time.Am looking forward to owning it.
1,Out-of-Date,"This book would have been helpfull in 1995, but now it's full of out-of-date information. There's absolutly nothing worth of information in it, so save your money and buy customers.com instead."
5,An excellent recipe for success .,"This book ""The E-commerce Building the E-Empire"" is a recipe for success. It takes you from marketing a site to building an e-commerce empire. It has excellent success stories to inspire you along the journey. I recommend this book to any one that is building an e-commerce solution for their company."
1,Author votes 5-stars ten-times here to boost his rating,"Basically, there is nothing of value in this book. Take a look for yourself. The author or someone with a vested interest in this book has given it repeated glowing 5-star reviews. What a laugh"
2,Too Confused,"The first sacrifice was to the readers of this book. The story really stretches believability and for no reason. Change some of the characters and you would buy into it. Another issue I had was the confusing sub plots that seemed to be through in just to add another 50 pages to keep up the size of Clancy or Ludlum books. Some of the characters were interesting and the end third of the book came together, but all in all it took an heck of an effort to get to the end. This is a book that takes all of your concentration to get through, and for all that work the pay off is not that rewarding."
1,Go to the store!,"I was appalled at both the poor condition and the poor design of this product. The stand and all 4 of the tables were scratched and nicked, showing the bright wood underneath. Everything was covered with a thick layer of dust. Some of the drill holes were slightly off, making assembly more difficult than it should have been. In addition, the screws all had Allen heads, requiring use of the enclosed Allen wrench, instead of being able to substitute a power screwdriver or drill with screwdriver bit. All in all, when one considers the exorbitant delivery cost (nearly as much as the item), I would have been MUCH better off going to a store to get something better (and probably overall cheaper)."
2,"Sturdy, but small and uncleanable","I had some nice oak tv trays, but since they didn't quite match my decor I decided to get these black ones. They're pretty sturdy, but that's their only benefit.They are small! I can fit my laptop on one but there is little to no room to use my mouse. They are fine for eating if you just have a plate and a drink.When they get anything spilled on them they never seem to come clean. Vinegar doesn't even do the trick....and vinegar cleans everything.I think I will be looking for new tv trays again...or maybe I should just start eating at the dining room table like a normal person."
5,I HATE YOU ALL,"Ok, just kidding!This is the first Ghoatwhore CD I owned and I love it! This does sound evil and it's straight forward ""Black & Roll!""What I like about this is that I listened to bands like Christian Death in my younger days, and they are more ""Death Rock/Gothic""and I hear elements of that in this disc. I like this more than their follow up in 2006.The worlds fastest song (that doesn't suck) is Chanting Bells of Funeral Anguish, which is probably my favorite track!I would say the first 6 songs are the strongest and the rest that follow are more or less filler tracks. But they are sostrong that I give it 5 stars. It's obvious that some of you just don't get it and don't know talent when you hear it!"
2,Outdated,"I was disappointed with this book. A few ideas were great, but most of it would have been more helpful ten years ago."
2,a bit lame,"Ideas in the book are good but they are presented in the most simple of ways, so you really need to use your style skills to ramp them up to a higher level of taste and execution. Fun book if you have decent sewing skills and just need a new POV on remodelling your out of date or boring clothes that are not ready for cleaning rags or the Good Will.Warning!! The color of the clothing re-cons shown in the book are all in the realm of girls age 8 and under...yes it is that bad!..Like I said, fun book, if you use your own input to tweak the ideas."
3,Great clipboard & Info - Low quality,"This clipboard has been wonderful during Nursing Clinicals, however the printing on the clipboard isn't sealed well. Being held for long periods of time causes the printing to rub off, and smear. Would definitely recommend, but would advise spraying with some sort of sealant before using!"
3,TIME/DATE is messed up,"I ordered this because I HAD to for nursing school. I had no choice. I would have preferred to get something in a color to personalize it but this is all that was available. It has a ton of help hints on it. However, I went through the set up process for setting time and date and for some reason it's the opposite so in setting the time I set the date and in setting the date I set the time so it's totally off in that regard but I'd prefer to turn it off all together I have a watch and the keyboard aspect the buttons are small and hard to push accurately so I don't think any of that will be as useful as the marketers would like you to believe. As always PRIME is something I couldn't live without anymore free two day shipping rocks!"
3,Buyer Beware: These Are Not the Original Hit Recordings,"In the early Eighties, John Anderson was one of the few country artists I listened to. Singles like ""I'm Just and Old Chunk of Coal,"" ""Would you Catch a Fallin' Star"" and ""Swingin'"" were honest country songs. When I came across this collection, it seemed to good to be true...turns out it was. These are solid performances of these songs with Anderson and his road band which has been together with no personnel changes in the past nine years. But the bottom line is that these are not the original hit versions of these songs. In fact, nowhere in the liner notes--or anywhere else in the CD booklet--does it explicity say these are re-recordings (perhaps that's why allmusic.com was quick to give this a 5-star rating), but one listen makes it obvious. So if you're looking for a collection of original hit recordings, this isn't it. If you're looking for faithful remakes, you won't be disappointed. Just don't be fooled like I was."
1,DECEPTION!!!,"I really don't mind the fact that these songs are REMAKES. They sound all right to me.THE TOTALLY DISGUSTING PART is that the cover tells you this fact ON THE BACK in LETTERS THE SAME SIZE AS THE FINE PRINT that comes at the bottom of every CD jacket. The letters are even COLORED so they blend in with the art work so that you will surely not notice the fact until after you have bought the damn CD!If you're going to update your songs, why do you need to disguise the fact?This is DECEPTION, people!JOHN, YOU AND YOUR RECORD COMPANY SHOULD BE ASHAMED!"
3,Not over the top,If you are hot for Mr. Lautner than this was a good movie for you. Just curious about the movie and his acting not a bad movie. The story is good and just enough romance. Just not a great movie. I was not bored out of my skull at any rate.
5,Action Movie with Story...Great Story,"Thought this was just another ""Twilight"" movie..but I was wrong...Taylor did a good job on this movie. The movie deserves a chance. It's not just a lame action movie, it got essence and great story....and drama too, packed into one. Glad I watched it! 5 stars!!!"
1,Awful. Just...awful!,"I was willing to give this movie a shot, I really was. However, the acting was beyond terrible (Lautner and Collins were horrifically bad), and the writing was even worse. Even Sigourney Weaver's performance was rubbish - which really speaks to how bad the directing must have been. This has got to be one of the most immature ""thrillers"" I've ever sat through.There is a reason that Amazon Prime offers this one up for free! And I must add, I'm one of those people that only writes reviews if something is really good....or REALLY BAD."
1,Not Even Fun for Lautner Fans,"The plot was totally unoriginal and I found myself getting bored, despite watching it with my two best girlfriends and a bottle of wine. We are huge Taylor Lautner fans, but this movie was so bad, and after watching the Twilight movies, that's saying a lot."
3,It was as expected...,This wasn't the best movie ever - but I didn't expect it to be. The storyline had a few question marks & the chemistry between actors was ok but the action was great & mostly believable. I was entertained & overall enjoyed the show.
2,"Some teens would like this, but don't let them watch it.","I have a hard time believing that anyone but teens could genuinely enjoy this film.Story: bad.Title: unrelated to movie.Portayal of teenage sexuality and partying: disappointing and a bad influence.Reason for big-name actors deciding to be in this movie: unknown.The parent figures were interesting enough while they lasted, and there must have been some other redeeming qualities that kept our interest for a while, but I'm not sure the plot made enough sense to merit analysis. This movie was really not worth the rental cost or the time it took to watch it."
4,Good movie,"Although the movie has a basic story line,it was entertaining. Taylor Launter has come a long way in his acting."
2,Abduction,This movie was boring and the story was hard to follow.Taylor Lautner is not a very good actor.The story is pretty lame.One of the worst movies of 2011.I think that alot of these people that are giving all these good reviews are not being honest.They probably are just a fan of those god awful Twilight movies and think he is hot.This guy has no screen presence.I don't think anyone but teenagers and college kids will like it.
2,Taylor - Stick with Twilight,"Not the best movie in the world. I was too caught up in his twilight movies with Taylor not wearing any SHIRT that I didn't realize that he didn't have any acting ability. The girl with the big eyebrows; what the hell? I thought she was going to attack poor bad acting Taylor with those things. It was creepy, not to be mean or anything but she needs some trimming up. The movie felt fake and the entire plot wasn't the very best, I felt as if I was watching a low budget show series of Nikita. The plot thing just wasn't doing it for me. Hey, again Taylor, go back to acting school or find some more movies that has something to do with you taking off ur clothes.Yepe."
2,Wooden to the core,Had high hopes that this would be a quality action flick. Taylor Lautner and the female lead are both one-dimensional actors whose romance is tissue paper thin. The action sequences are over-dramatized and non-engaging. You never have any doubt about the resolution of the movie.
2,eyebrows,I could not pay much attention due to the fact that I was distracted by the girls giant eyebrows through the whole movie.
1,just...no,"first off...the title is all wrong. what abduction...never was one. the whole plot makes no sense. some of the action scenes were ok but there was no context. it was just random scenes thrown together...and he cannot act! very wooden. just...no, dont waste your time"
1,Can I give it zero stars?,"This actually caused me and my girlfriend physical pain when watching it. Between the hackneyed storyline, the bland action coupled with vomit-inducing teen romance, the awkward dialogue, and the weirdly horrible camera angles (seriously, what?), there's really no reason you should ever watch this turd. Seriously, I hope you're just reading these reviews for laughs, and not actually thinking about streaming it.It was in fact so horrible that my girlfriend was too busy raising her eyebrow and letting out an exasperated ""huuuuuh?"" to enjoy Lautner with his shirt off. Unless you're a Twilight fan (in which case you CLEARLY don't care about logic or story or depth anyway), don't watch this. I think I had more fun in the 5 minutes spent writing this review than I did in the whole two hour runtime. I'm embarrassed enough to want to remove all trace of it from my Amazon Prime watch history (and from the pixels used in reproducing the images on my TV screen)."
5,Pretty Good,"I don't understand the negative reviews on this movie. You have to go into this movie being aware that its not going to be a Liam Neeson caliber action flick, but for what it is, I thought it was pretty good. It kept my attention and the leads had chemistry. I would definitely recommend it!"
4,Abduction,It gets rather cheesey but definitely worth watching once. I like Taylor Lautner and know he is a capable actor for turning out quality.
4,Exciting film.,"This film starts out rather boring but gets very exciting as it progresses. Not sure if Taylor Lautner is an ""action-type"" hero, but he does a decent job. The film has a very good and different theme. The action gets really good and holds your interest after a somewhat slow beginning. Would recommend this flick highly."
2,weak...very weak,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. The storyline was horrible and the acting was worst than horrible. Lots of unnecessary scenes and terrible effects.
2,Wast of time and money,This was a terrible movie! I regret spending my time and money on this movie. I had high hopes and was very disappointed with the overall story line and acting.
1,Terrible,"This... Is a terrible movie. The acting is horrible. The plot is stupid. The characters suck. Sigourney Weaver is the only bright spot of this film. Just don't waste your time... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Lautner was surprising as an action star.,"This young actor is well suited for an action hero role. The movie has all the action elements, but Lautner did not deliver as an actor. As a pretty face on the screen, he has that nailed. Overall the movie is worth the rent, but not one I'll revisit."
1,This Movie's Terrible,"Please do not be fooled by the reviews that some of these people are leaving. This movie is absolutely terrible and Lautner should never be allowed to act. He'd be a very good underwear model but that's it. Do yourself a favor and save yourself some money by going to a reputable site like Rotten Tomatoes or Flixster before hitting the ""add to cart"" button on this one."
1,a big dissapointment,"I hate to say it, but I am really disappointed with Jonatha and this CD. Her last CD ""Steady Pull"" rates 5 stars - its great! She's also wonderful in concert. But the quality of her songwriting has really slipped,and her wonderful stage presence which shines on her earlier cd's just isn't here. Almost all of the songs on the disc lack any real heart or soul. And unfortunately, 3 of the songs on this very short running disc (approx. 41 minute) are uninspired covers - almost like fillers. Take those out of the mix and you have an EP, not a full lenght recording. She seems to have run out of steam and inspiration. Her limited touring in support of this disc, and her embarrasing pitch for monitary donations on her web site (i'd be happy to part with some cash for a decent disc or concert) don't bode well....I sincerely hope she can pull herself out of this slump."
1,Don't Waste Your money!,"I was really dissapointed! This CD was real slow and lifeless; it also had several watered-down remakes. I don't know what happened to Jonatha; it seems she's lost it. Her last CD, ""Steady Pull"" rocks! It is one of my favorite CDs."
4,Another Hot One,"Funky Groove House Music! DJ Dan has been one of my favorite DJ's for a while. If your into funky house this is your guy. ""Roundtrip"" is two discs full of hot jumpin' house to keep your head bobbing and your feet moving. Trance is finally over and house is back. This is a must buy for house heads. My favorite track so far has to be Czr & Ito's ""Soiree"", but I love 'em all."
2,BOGUS ESP ANGLE! LACKS SUSPENSE!,"Aubrey Glenn wrote a bestselling self-help book on ""creative imagery,"" (which really sounds more like getting in touch with one's innerself plus using one's intuition/gut-feel and some guesswork). Jesse though, mistakenly believes it's ESP and pushes Aubrey to help solve the mysterious disappearance/murder of his cousin's family.Jesse's character has an overly conceited ego who literally thinks he's God's gift to women! I mean, he's eveready for sex and just won't believe not every woman wants him, too. Thank goodness after the first 100 pages, we see a more caring, responsible, and admirable side to him."
2,Too Self-Indulgent,"Like other reviewers, I will not that it is simplistic, and mainly for people who are lower functioning, and younger than 20. This deals with practical real life information for people who want to find their first job, but never goes beyond the basics.For 300 pages, only about 20 or so pages were applicable to me, as I have Aspergers, but not at the point where I need to worry about living in a group home.Much of it I could not relate to, problems that the author had with Aspergers that I did not.Mostly, it's self indulgent. It's a collection of lists rather than a book, and he even spends a whole chapter doing math problems.This is at best, an average book. Freaks, Geeks, and Asperger's Syndrome is a better read."
5,A must...,"If you serve our great country in the military, or even if you don't this one is a must read. We as Americans have a tendency to view things from the very unique American perspective. We do ourselves no favors when trying to understand the Jihadist from this perspective. This book gives you the opportunity to look at the Jihadists from their perspective and gives you an in-depth look at the background and belief system of our present day enemy."
4,Awesome song!,"I must say, the first time I saw the music video for this song at about 3 in the morning or so, I was skeptical. They seemed like another imitation girl group. However, after listening to this song some more, I have grown to love it! I love the beat, and the flashing lights in the video make for an awesome effect. I think I'll be buying the single very soon...I look forward to hearing their other songs!"
3,He Loves You Not/This is Me,"Well, This is a pretty good dvd. First, It has both of Dream's music videos This is Me & He Loves You Not and They're both the full versions of the videos along with a making of, It also includes quite a few pictures of the group Dream, The bios of each of the girls and it even has 2 easter eggs on it consisting of the 2 songs that weren't included on the cd and A short video clip of them demoing one of the songs. But I will leave that for you people to find. This is a pretty good dvd better than what I expected the sound is good I love playing this through my speakers even though it is only dolby surround sound, the picture is pretty crisp, However sometimes it seems as if youre looking at the tv quality versions of the videos and not the quality expected coming from watching a DVD. Also I wish they couldve put more on this dvd But I guess not overall 3 stars for this dvd it couldve been better in terms of the picture quality and with the sound issues."
5,Catchy and cool,"I think this is a catchy song and a pretty good group. The lead vocolist, Holly, has a fab voice and the rest of the group supports here pretty well. I recommend for all of you to buy the single, listen to the words, and stand up and dance. I really can't wait for their whole cd to come out! Trust me, these girls aren't the spice girls. These girls have talent. If you are not sure that you would be into this kind of music, i suggest you try out the single. .... U have nothing to loose. ...."
1,Not Necessary,"The information in this book can be obtained online, and the preaching you can live without. Mind mapping is pretty intuitive. Once you see one you will say ""I get it"" and start using them. There is simply not enough information to go on and on about them in multiple books. I thought maybe I was missing something. Now I feel like I was snookered into paying for someone's info-mercial. The basic idea is good, and the binding is cute."
1,Hype and nonsense,"This book is wrong about the brain, and is wrong to hype mind mapping into every task in the universe. The left/right brain info is just myth, the 1% brain use stuff is just myth. The newer stuff on multiple intelligences is just rhetoric (he keeps adding intelligences as he goes along, blowing with the wind).People have been using graphic organizers for centuries. Tony Buzan only originated the hype. Here is similar hype that led to some litigation (by a different author).http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/FTCActions/trudeau.htmlBest to stick with learning/communication methods that actually are appropriate for the task.JVogel"
3,Inconsistent,I first bought this product a year ago. The spirulina was a deep emerald green color and smelled a bit like the ocean. I then reordered a couple of days ago. It's now a yellow-green color and tastes more like grass. I'd rank the first incarnation a 5 and the most recent one a 2.
4,FYI - Not the best Best of BOC...,"...but if you get this AND ""Essential BOC"", you'll really have all the BOC worth hearing. I bought this one a few years ago at the late Circuit City, because it was 2 CD's for $6, and nearly all of it was kind of lost on me until this past weekend, when I got my hands on ""Essential BOC"". Wow! That really brought it alive! Trust me, you'll be glad to have both."
5,pretty awesome album,"Well 4-5 star album. Its really good music, not sure what else to say I can't think of a reason off hand to give it 4 stars, but probably later there will be a track or two that I will decide to remove from my iTunes."
4,Pretty Doggone Good!,"One of J's early albums. The track ""Taxi"" is my favorite. All in all J Blackfoot is a real good singer."
5,J Blackfoot,This cd is great. He has great music the song Taxi is a great hit the entire cd is good listening.
1,Not worth the trouble.,"If you have never been intimate before with a member of the opposite sex, then this is the book for you. This is basicly a how to have sex for dummies. Its really bad. I purchased this in hopes of learning the tantric practice, exercises, and the techneques to use in the tantric experaince. WRONG. It basicly touched on the foundation of tantra and the levels it is founded on. A total wase of time. If your a virgin, or just not very experianced and insecure about what to do, than this is the book for you. Dont be fooled by the title."
2,Who you fool'in ?,"All these titles are in the $5.99 ben at walmart,,I could buy all of 'em new at walmart for around $75.00 dollars or less."
4,A real insight in the power of Islam as a religuous force.,"VS Naipaul's book gives a real insight in the people behind Islam in countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran and Malaysia. They become real people instead of objects of news-stories, that cover fundamentalism and/or terrorism. The diversity of life-stories and different views on the development in these countries puts the everyday news in a more human perspective. To sum up: a great book that everybody should read who follows the international news."
1,Re-defining Prostitution,"Naipaul has shameless offered his skills and ability, to the highest bider, rasing his price by fabrication and contrivartional manipulation. For much worse adaptaions can be found close to home, ""round the corner"" if you will for which any ""extensive travel"" is not required. Just happens who you want to put down. Kudos on a cheap shot."
4,Islamic loyalty or slavery?,"The creator of Islam, Mohammad, must have been very clear man to include Arab culture as a part of Moslem religion. The Moslems of non-Arab countries have ensured that they remain more loyal to the Arabia than there own land particularly in the Indian subcontinent. Is it a loyalty or slavery? Kudos to V S Naipaul for exposing these soldiers of Islam."
4,Satan Rocks!,"Think about it: God doesn't want us to get drunk; Satan does. God doesn't want us to take drugs; Satan does. God doesn't want us to have sex outside of marriage; Satan loves that one! What kind of miserable existance would we have without Satan? Alright, this account of the development of the concept of Satan begins with scholarly observations, and is sometimes had to follow. But as the reader begins to see the relevance of the historical development of Satan, the book takes off and is actually fun to read. I even learned a little Hebrew by reading this account. Peppered with humor, The Birth of Satan gives a well studied view of the dynamics that necessitated the need for an opposing evil force, thus, Satan is a God - just a sick one. Forgive the sappy final line, Love wins out in the end, enjoy the history, humor, and observations of a well written sccount."
5,The greatest Cause -,"This CD is yet another wonderful example of the hearts of all those at hillsong - to bring people to the throne of God in Worship. Amazing, inspiring and anointed. All I can say is Thank you to them for helping to open the door of my heart and invited Gods love in through their music. For the cause... to worship our Father. Each song has brought me to a new understanding, a new realisation of who I am and who God is. I'll never stop learning about him. There Songs take you to that special place every one of them."
3,Disappointing.......,"Perhaps for a different author this book would rate a 7 but after Diehl's other two Martin Vail books this was a 5 at best. If you had not already read the previous two books you would not have a clear picture of how intelligent and savvy Martin Vail, Jane Veneable and the ""Wild Bunch"" are. I too did not see the reason for the inclusion of Aaron Stampler. I think Vail is at his best in the courtroom and there was none of that here. This simply was not Diehl at his best. I hope Diehl brings this crew back again and I hope we get to read about them in action in the courtroom.Ree-views"
1,Save our forrests. Don't buy this book.,What a disappointment. This book starts out giving us a very bright hero using his brains to take on a violent sociopath. It ends up as another shoot-em-up that reads like a blue print for a movie script rather than a novel. What a waste of time it was reading the final third of this book.
2,Just not a very good book,"While this certainly is not the worst book I have read, it still isn't very good. A hundred pages into the book, there still isn't any semblance of a plot. It also seems as though there are new characters in every chapter and you can get confused as to who is who because none of them seem any different from each other. I really think that this could have been a decent book, but in the end it fails. Although, for some reason, I think that it might not be too bad if it were a movie."
4,Great new Diehl!!,"I have read all three of the ""Martin Vail Trilogy"" and have found all of them quite enjoyable. Even though I did like Show of Evil a bit more, Reign in Hell is still a good novel, if you read it more for the Martin Vail characterisation, then the vail/Stampler interaction. Even so, I found it a bit lacking in the area of ""coutroom"" drama, after the first RICO case we are all but devoid of legal/courtroom argument, often my favourite part of Diehl's novels. In saying this though, i found the last part, aptly titled ""armageddon"" was absolutely brilliant. It was fast paced and kept me reading. I admit Vail thumbing his nose at the President was maybe a LITTLE bit over the top but hey, it is so typical of his character, I suppose we can forgive Diehl!! Overall a good book, I say 9 out of 10"
1,"Less than ordinary, it wasn't worth publishing at all","I am disappointed. It is not at least interesting. The contents is very standard as if the book was written according to some silly ""How to write a bestseller"" edition. The book is overloaded with details but as the writing is not good, it is hard to concentrate on them. If I were the author, I would do my job more carefully."
1,Failed after a few months,"We purchased this coffee maker after reading various comments -- it sounded like a good coffee maker. At first it worked fine, but now after only 6 months, it no longer functions. We generally make about 6 cups at a time. For the past month or so, it would only run through about half the water. If we restarted it, then it ran rest of the water. Now it doesn't work at all and we have to go through the hassle of seeing if it repairable. Very annoying. Other coffee makers have lasted us about 10 years or so on average. This is really disappointing!"
3,Pretty good,"Works pretty well but two complaints. One, the carafe does not keep the coffee hot for very long. Two, the lid on the carafe makes for very slow pouring."
3,Okay,The books are not varied enough for my children. Contain good mini books and handwriting practice. The phonics work has the answers on the same page. No critical thinking is required.
5,Top quality,Plain and simple super easy to install super strong double tape so try to put it in right place the first time.
3,Good but some odd statements.,"I purchased this as I wanted to see the argument against broken windows theory (I am for broken windows theory). The author obviously hates broken windows theory and tries to state why it is bad, and presents his arguments. What I didn't like about this book is that constantly throughout the book he uses the terms broken windows and zero tolerance interchangeably. It is clear that both methods are very different, broken windows is about order maintenance, zero tolerance is about law enforcement. An author who is trying to provide a book that involves a whole argument against broken windows should know that. Netherless I found it informative."
2,Not as nice as the photo,I know this is an inexpensive ring but it looks so much more 'cheap' than the photo online. Save your money.
3,"TALENTED SOLOISTS, POOR CHOIR","I was able to borrow this CD from a library. The choir is, in my opinion very poor. Unless you like to hear bass, tenor, alto and soprano parts reduced to unison, with all the wonderful counterpoint and harmonies submerged, buy the new one conducted by Jan Willem de Vriend. Click on ""my reviews"" to read my review of this new CD."
5,Images of Ancient America: Visualizing Book of Mormon Life,"WOW! This is a perfect addition to my collection! It's a perfect companion to Sorenson's ""An Ancient American Setting For The Book Of Mormon"". ""Images"" does just that, it provides excellent visualization for life during the Nephite/Lamanite era. What a gem!"
5,Great Story and Songs,I saw this at the Macon Film Festival and was really impressed. Air is a really well crafted story of various people trying to find love and their place in this world. The music is fun and diverse and it really moves the story along in an emotional way. All together this is a great film about how people all move to a different drummer.
5,Spectacular!,Fantastic independent film for those who like to be fully entertained! You will not be disappointed.
3,Kinda Disappointing,This copying book does not provide a transliteration. Since one of the main objectives is to familiarize yourself with the ligatures that would have been nice. But it does have some nifty phrases.
4,Good Book -- Good Author,"I enjoyed this book very much. Even though I didn't like the situation that the main characters got into, I like the fact it was realistically drawn out. It wasn't the ""typical"" happy ever after ending. Awaiting Ms. Rices' next book..."
4,An Excellent Debut novel,I had this book on the shelf for a while. I was afraid to pick it up for fear I would not like it but I was pleasantly surprised. Genie the other woman. David who is going through a mid life crisis met and fall in love. One comes to their senses(?) and the other can't let go. It was a page turner just to see what was going to happen next. Will they stay together or not. It also gave a little hint of what a May December romance could be like. Someone so young and vibrant. The other worried about growing old. I thought the book was well written and I enjoyed the secondary characters Paulette and Evelyn.
3,"Alright, but challenging if you don't know Arabic","This is overall a very informative book, but it bogs down greatly with the inclusion of hundreds of Arabic terms and people that are not defined or explained. If you don't have any knowledge of Arabic, or the historical people related with the Middle East, you might spend hours of additional time researching on the internet and in other books."
4,Classic Tijuana Brass,"Several decades after its release, this album is still as fresh and energetic as the day it debuted. Along with the other Tijuana Brass albums, it helped revolutionize the image of brass, taking it out of the ""Big Band"" era of the 1930s-50s and paving the way for the ska bands of today."
1,DRF expanded,"I found this book very disappointing and so unworthy of such an interesting figure as Earl Sande. The author seemed to have good intentions in researching Sande's life, but fell far short of the mark and wrote the book anyway. The result was contrived dialogue and expanded race results from the Daily Racing Form. I purchased the book from the author at Emerald Downs during Derby weekend. I liked him and I wanted to like the book, but it was just too laughable."
2,Not amazing for the money,"I used to use Tresemme that's four dollars for the same size bottle. I decided to splurge and spend some money on myself, but what you get for your money here is not dramatic or life-changing results. I'll stick to the Tresemme in the future."
3,Not the best,"It's not something I plan on buying in the future. It makes my hair look greasy the day after I used it. It controls the friz only on the top of my hair and not the bottom. It makes my hair shiny and silky, but only on the day I used it on. I don't hate it, but I don't like it either."
2,"What's so ""grown up"" about this??","Sophisticated and grown-up?? Is that what they call dull House music these days? Elevator music must be pretty ""grown-up"" for some of you, too! p.s. - just because something doesn't have much of a beat and you can't dance to it does not make something mature. This is to House what chill-out is to Trance - really only good as total background music - you won't remember a single song after it's over or really notice it's there. Totally forgettable. ...but if that's what you want, then by all means!"
2,Creative Therapy with Children & Adolescents,"I have used this book for over two years now. The book comes with many great ideas for therapeutic interventions. However, many of the exercises suggest that you refer to certain stories or activity sheets that are not in this book. (You must purchase an additional book to use with this one.) I would have preferred if this book had clearly stated on the cover that it needs to be in conjunction with another one. I still have not found the other book that this one refers to!"
2,Get the workbook instead,"Get the workbook instead, by the same authors. It has pretty much identical information, and includes reproducible handouts. Some exercizes only work with older kids..."
3,Not exactly solid wood...,"There is definitely some particle board in this cabinet, but once I put it together, it seems solid enough. It looks good sitting next to my black roll-top desk, and open and closes smoothly. Holds legal or letter sized files, and is not very deep. Warning: the back is a folded thin particle board panel, so it definitely has to go against a wall. All the other panels are very thick."
5,What is Sound?,"The music found all around us is illuminated by both Cage and Kirk, spliced together in a double movie that heads the same direction. Everything has a value and a meaning that one attaches to it, who is to say that nothing is not music or sound? The conventional boundaries of music are abandoned for a rather Zen approach to the process. One can judge and say that Roland Kirk wears the dark sunglasses because he is high out of his mind and John Cage bangs on a bicycle for an appealing noise but wouldn't that be a simple way out? Both of these man are brilliant in their own right, based on a different outlook that is applicable to living aside from music."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time or Money,This is a piece of junk. The shield kept falling off until is was permanently fixed to the trimmer. The cut was uneven and the line snagged and bound up in the reel especially around a chain link fence. It was just over a year old when the gears went out and the string quit turning. Do not waste your time or money on this piece of junk. This is the last McCulloch product I will buy
4,Worth the extra couple $,This duo creates what in my opinion is dark neo-classical. This music is as haunting as it is beautiful. Very good arrangments that really compliment the crisp clear soprano female vocals. Makes you feel like your in a different place and time. Good music to listen to when wanting to be a little detached from the normal pop fix and want something with more substance and lets you put your guard down enough to get a little more connected to the more subtle emotions that are missing in most music today.
3,Still serching,I have been serching so long without any luck so does anybody know what Grin's first alblum was? What the cover might have looked like?
5,Great tool,I was surprised by the high quality of this tool for the low price I paid. I just love it!
4,Great book!,This is called a Spiritual Alphabet. The title says exactly what it is: an ABC guide to spirituality - with a Franciscan touch! It is great to read the person who has influenced St Teresa of Avila
2,His earlier stuff with the Playboys is much better,"The tracks on this album are later recordings of Bob Wills from 1965 until his death. They are, by and large, not recorded with the Playboys (though one or two show up on a few tracks). Instead of the 30's/40's West Texas sound I love, these recordings have something of a Vegas/Sinatra 60's feel to them, especially in the backing. I'd recommend The Essential Bob Wills or The Anthology instead."
2,Real product looks so much different,"I think I speak for most when I say that online products look vastly in pictures as compared to the physical item but this was absurd! I even checked the box and receipt to check if I received the wrong item which I, much to my disappointment, did not (kudos to amazon I guess?). The real item itself carries a much darker shade of brown-close to black even. The fitting was good (I sized down by one according to general advice) and so was the quality but I guess I'll just have to live with it, and I hope, much like wine, that this is an acquired taste. ):"
5,Clark's Desert Boots,"These boots are exactly the same as the pairs I owned 30 years ago, they don't last that long I was elated to find them again at such a reasonable cost."
5,These were a birthday present for my step son.,"These were a birthday present for my 18 year old step son. He LOVES them, and has thanked us for them at least 10 times in the past 2 weeks."
3,"I want to love them, but ...","These boots look cool, and they're quite well made, but they're lacking in the comfort department. Particularly they have ZERO arch support. I installed some cheap foam insoles to soften my step, and they help, but what's really needed is an insole with a little support. Also, when they're tied tightly, the tension doesn't go around to the back of the boot. The tightness occurs around mid foot. So that feels a little odd too.I nearly sent them back. However I decided that, with the foam insoles, they were comfortable enough to keep.Oh, and I wear thicker socks with them too. A must."
4,Beeswax are good looking but not that comfortable,"Pros:Appearance (Beeswax) - I wasnt sure about them at first from the pictures but once you put them on they do look good. They look a little darker than in the photos, and color isn't completely uniform, and they scuff easily but they look good ""worn in."" Great way to ""grow up"" your shoe collection from sneakers without going to full on dress shoes.Cons:Comfort level - The sole is not padded and my feet hurt after the first office work day. After a few days you do get used to it but I really recommend insoles.Sole color - gets blackened very quickly and easily and are the reason I'm stuck with my slightly-too-small size.Other:Sizing - As people have said, they're too big. I recommend 0.5 size down and NOT 1 full size. A half size down may be a bit long but when I went a full size down (to 8 from my normal 9) they were too narrow and tight across the top of my feet. They are so tight that I unfortunately cannot use insoles."
4,"good look, but stiffening",Shoes are much stiffer than I expected. Im hopeful they work like rainbow sandals where you have to wear in the leather bf they fit well
3,Clarks Original CDBs for less,Comfortable and attractive shoes but for whatever reason the leather on the pair i received is starting to separate from the sole in a couple of spots. I've only had a pair for a couple of months but expected the quality to be a little higher.
4,Clark's Desert Boots,"The boots are quite comfortable and, in my opinion, good-looking. Time will tell if they hold up to the rigors of wear, but for now I'm satisfied. The seller, Gabriel Shoes, was prompt and helpful. Even after having to return the original pair for one a half-size larger, the exchange was made and shipped back to me within a few days. Good footwear and good service; I am happy."
2,"Look great, but not good fitting","The Clarks Desert Boots look great with jeans and khakis. However, I just don't like the way they feel around my feet. With only two lace eyelets, they never seem to feel snug around my feet. As with most shoes, YMWV with your feet."
3,It came with a lot of scratches around the toe,"I don't know if that is a normal thing, but I was surprised to say the least. I had the foresight to go half a size down from what I normally wear. It fits well."
4,Awesome shoes,"Was looking for another pair of brown shoes. I love these things, they are like a mix between a moccasin and a boot. They are very comfortable and work well in many situations. As others have said, order a size down. I did and I feel like I probably could have even gone another half a size down. I took a star off because the laces feel pretty cheap and they are starting to cut the material of the shoe when I tie them tightly."
1,not happy,"We did receive our product i was disapointed because the boots we received were to big, my husband takes a US 10 that is what we ordered and they were far too big so then we had to return them and the cost was nearly as much as the boots $52 aust dollars to return them . Linda Hansen"
5,Desert boots,"Very nice fitting, true to size. The color and suede texture are great.I am very pleased with the boots.Great purchase"
5,"Reluctant At First, But I Love 'Em Now.","I was definitely skeptical about buying CDB's at first; they don't look that great in the picture, and they seem rather simplistic. As soon as i put them on, though, my entire opinion about them changed. They're a little uncomfortable at first, but once you break them in, they're great. With a pair of dark jeans, they're perfect. I would also suggest, if you want to spruce them up a bit, buying Obenauf's LP or some other leather oil; I used Obenauf's on mine to waterproof them, but the color ended up changing pretty drastically as well. They're now a much darker, deeper, richer brown than before; but I love the new look. I would definitely rate the Beeswax CDB's 5/5. :)"
5,AWESOME!,"Nabbed these a couple weeks ago off here for $75 delivered, when they go for no less than $150 over here (Australia) in storesStoked with them! Fit great, look great, really comfortable.Definitely get a size down, I usually fit a size 10 in runners and grabbed a 9 upon reading the other comments and it fits well. I think I could of even went a 8.5 and stretched them a bit!"
2,They run really big,"They look good, but they're so long I kept tripping. Too bad shoe manufacturers can't agree on a standard size."
2,not as good...,"...as another pair that I bought somewhere else last year. The pair I just got is made in Vietnam (older pair does not say) and its leather is much stiffer, even keeping into account that they are new. I believe that the shape is also somewhat different (more difficult to inert the foot in it). But I am not sure of this. What I am sure of, however, is that I would end up not wearing them. I doubt that the leather would soften enough to make them comfortable. I am going to return them."
4,These boots are great!,"These boots are awesome. Very comfortable and look fantastic, wear with jeans and your classy and rugged. In regards to size, make sure you order a size down, because they do run big. I wear an 11 sneaker and wear a 10 for the boot, I could probably go down to a 9.5. Secondly, they are suede and therefore do get dirty very quickly and easily. If you are the type of person who has to have that ""fresh"" look than I would recommend you go with a darker color than sand. I've found that with a brush and some proper cleaning technique they can retain their luster. One thing I do wish I had done before wearing them out is to put some suede protector spray on them. Hope this review helps!"
4,Clark's Desert Boots,The good: Original Clarks--just like I had in the 60's (though no longer made in England). Size was correct. Arrived in less than a week even with free shipping.The bad: Shoes have a musty odor which will hopefully fade.
3,"great looking and comfortable, but sole not durable","These boots look great with jeans or khakis, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them. My only issue is with the sole wearing very quickly. I've had them for about a month and the sole is already showing significant wear on the heel. I tend to walk over 3 miles a day at work on tile floors, and I was surprised at how quickly the crepe sole was wearing out. However, they look great and are very comfortable after breaking them in. I'd only recommend these boots for lazy days when you're not moving around a lot since I figured the sole would only last another 4 months at work."
3,"Fashionable, not the most comfortable","Shoes fit a good 1/2 to full size large (I usually wear 11.5, had to buy a 10.5 of these.) There is zero arch support, and the middle of the shoe presses uncomfortably into the top of my foot. Having said that it's tolerable, and they are good looking boots for the price."
5,Sick Boots,"Boots are awesome, look great with khakis. I wear size 13 they ran just a little big but there's no 12.5 so i am happy, fit great with normal socks."
3,new desert boots from vietnam via great britain,"unfortunately these new desert boots were not nearly comfortable enough to even try to wear in. the back was approximately 1/2"" higher than my old really comfortable ones. not good enough. thanks. caveat emptor."
3,not wha't I expected,I thought they would be suede desert boots instead of leather or some other made made material. They are ok but not as pictured in the ad which should have been suede!
1,Poor product,"I bought many items from Clarks in the past and I am very please. But this item looks not like a Clark's. The upper leather is very hard, like a sawed. Unfortunately I live out of USA, so return this pair of boots is so expensive for me."
3,Ok for what it's worth,"These weights aren't the best, bust for what I paid for them they're worth it. There was a little discoloration on some of the weights though, but other than that they are a decent buy."
1,Hypocrites,"If the Goads lived by the words they sing, this world would be a different place. some of the music is wonderful - Nothing Cleaner than the blood of Jesus - beautiful. But I would never spend money on it because they are arrogant, deceitful and have evil streaks in them - especially Carolyn. Curt is not pure as brother Tim puts it. Trust me. So, save your money and spend it on artists that deserve it."
5,beautiful puzzle!,I've got most of the Quiltscape puzzles and this is probably one of the prettiest.
5,Searching for the book vs. the disk?,"The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is available in three formats. Sellers often incorrectly match the ISBN to the format. It may be helpful to know the ISBN, rather than to rely on the results of a search by Title/Author.Hardcover Book: ISBN 0125586302Macintosh Disk: ISBN 0125586310MSDOS/IBM Disk: ISBN 0125586329Also, use the price as a clue to which item you will be receiving - the book sells for $70+, the disk for under $20."
1,"This is a data disk, not the book","This product is not the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as it is portrayed here on Amazon; it is instead an almost useless data disk. The integer sequences are there all right, in lexicograhic order; but they are completely unidentified (except for a code number keyed to the book)! In other words, without the book this very expensive diskette is useless.Basically I consider this to be false advertising. Do not buy it unless you already have the book and want a machine-readable, searchable copy of the sequences."
2,A terrible reflection of the actual test,I chose this book because it had a lot of practice tests and I didnt really need the review because I had a strong background in math from school. If you want to practice for the SAT II dont use these tests. THey are much harder than the actual test. I ended up getting an 800 on the SAT but considered not taking the day of because the night before the test I was still getting 550s on the practice tests. Luckily I chose to take my chances anyway but this book only made me nervous and did not help at all.
1,very bad book,"The review book is poorly organized. Instead of trying to teach you the main points you'll need to know for the exam, it tries to cram in every single thing that has ever appeared on the Math IIC exams. If you want to spend your entire year preparing for this one hour exam, go ahead and try the book, but for those looking for an organized, to-the-point, and useful review book, don't buy it."
2,"Good prep, but not the best practice.","If you have this book, keep using it for the review only, but not for the tests. I suggest, use 15 Tests of Meylani for the practice."
1,"Waste of time and money, too hard, not beneficial.",This book has nothing newer than the sixth edition. The cover has changed only and it is still incomplete. Some questions in the test surprised me a lot although I wasted too much time on the questions in this book. I absolutely do not recommend it!
5,"A ""Thank You"" for Dame Joan","A wonderful way for Decca to say ""Thank You"" for the many years this great singer, one of the most important voices of the 20th Century, gave her all to the many recordings made for this company. Of course, most fans will have all the recordings already, but to have the original art work for all the albums she made, as well as some rare photos made available is a real treat. Time and time again I marvel at the quality of Dame Joan's voice and her incredible facility. She makes it all sound so easy. Thank You again, Dame Joan!"
5,I miss this in the stores!,"Hooray for at least finding this online. This is the only chapstick I use, and I was frantic when I couldn't find it in the stores."
2,not worth it,"In my opinion, if a book claims to be a ""Bible"", it should contain at least one chapter about Jesus Christ.Although there are a lot of teachings in The Fence Bible that could be viewed as biblical allegories, there is not one word about Jesus Christ anywhere in the book. So I view The Fence Bible as nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the Lord's work without giving any credit to the Lord.Don't waste your time building fences with The Fence Bible. Stick with a real Bible. With a real Bible, you can learn how to build things much greater than fences.I'm giving this book two stars (instead of one star) because it is a pretty good book if you like fences, and it contains a lot of interesting facts. For example; did you know that it is illegal in some states to build a fence out of spite?"
4,Another great Yo-Yo Disc,The set-up with the classical pieces on the first disc and the other on the second is excellent.
2,Non-essential,"The ratings on this 2 CD set are inflated. The first CD is enjoyable, but no more than an assembly of tracks from other Yo-Yo Ma albums. The second disc is uninteresting. I think there are much more enjoyable Yo-Yo Ma albums to invest in than this one."
2,Just ok.,I thought Olivia Davidson died in the big earthquake in Sweet Valley High around the twins' 18th bday? She has a three second cameo near the end of this book.
2,Boss Speakers,"O.K. speakers - not much sound, no bass response. O.K. for the price - not recommended."
2,Rationalization at its best.,"This is a compulsive person's dream. To have a psychologist tell them its OK; That they can master their compulsive behavior and still get to dive in head first into the substance of their choice, trading. Definitely marketed toward novice day traders who have so much to risk. I was disappointed."
5,Fabulous!,"As a licensed psychotherapist, I am constantly searching for tools to assist me in helping my clients ""maximize their potentials."" I have found the tools offered through Anne's book, ""Mindworks"" to be just what ""the doctor (or shall I say, 'mechanic') ordered."" Of all the NLP books I've read, this one IS the best. The author's writing style and frequent use of metaphor's greatly enhances the book's message and application. I plan to read and reference, ""Mindworks"" many times as I want to access Anne's many tools of wisdom. Thank you, Anne!"
2,Stating the Obvious,"For a book which claims to offer new insight into how the mind works most of the stuff in this book is mind-numbingly obvious. Examples: Be flexible in thinking, use specifics when talking to someone, don't asume other people know what you are talking about, make sure you explain as much as you can. I suppose this book is useful to some but to me I found it kinda obvious. It reminded me a little of Scientology with some of the mind techniques for dealing with emotions. In the end its not really something I'd recommend unless you were really into NLP in the first place."
4,Not-so-loud Chili Peppers' songs,"First and foremost, The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a hard rock band. Nobody is going to buy this album in order to hear the Chili Peppers- that would be stupidity. There are only two reasons anybody would purchase this album:1. You love the Chili Peppers' music and You want a change of pace.2. You love listening to string instruments (such as the violin).Buy this album if you love the Chili Peppers' music and you love strings. That sounds like a no-brainer..."
5,great series for kids,My son really loves these videos... and they have a good message and the songs are good. Highly recommended. We like VHS tapes because they are more durable.
2,Mediocre fantasy,"Some interesting ideas, including the concept of going from a SciFi system to a Fantasy system, but by and large, this is only worth cotton candy."
3,Good for a sleeping bra....But not for sports!~,Good for a sleeping bra....But not for sports!~ Unless you are very small busted there's no real support in these for exercise ....comfy for sleeping and around the house!~
4,Saturn ventshade,"It was very easy to intall as it is taped on. Great price, lowest I found online and free shipping, can't beat that! Arrived a week sooner than promised."
1,Ugh,"Being a huge fan of both Sherlock Holmes and vampires, I pounced on this book when I first saw it. I expected great things from two of my favorite genres put together!Alas, it was not to be. The story is only a rewrite of Stoker's ""Dracula"" with Holmes kind of thrown in for flavour. There is absolutely no point for Holmes' involvement and, in fact, the client who brought him the case in the first place just sort of disappears. The story remains more-or-less true to the origional which, as I said, means there is no reason for Holmes to be there. The action, such as it is, is confusing and unnecessary. For example, a lot of space is taken up with a boat race which seemed like it was written in just to put some action in the story.As much as I wanted to recommend this, I can't. A much better mix of Holmes/Dracula is Saberhagen's ""The Holmes/Dracula File"". Give this one a miss."
1,Non-Christian Author,"Author admits not being a christian, and though it comments on Jesus not being God, I see no value in the rest of the material. (No, Jesus is not lord God; he's lord Messiah)"
1,NOT CHOLESTEROL FREE,"I bought this because the amazon page says that it is ""cholesterol free."" It isn't...it actually has more than most (I think around 40% of your daily intake in one serving). Plus it tasts REALLY bad (I've been mixing it with Muscle Milk to cover the taste because I'm too cheap to just throw it away), it's extremely grainy (kinda coats your throat going down making it super gaggy) and sometimes all the protein in it dumps out and coagulates into a nasty ball inside the shake ball in my shaker-cup if I don't drink it fast enough...I've eaten some pretty horrible stuff (mostly on dares) and I can't handle a Universal only protein shake...too nasty. I'm sticking souly to Muscle Milk and Optimum Nutrition brand protein powders...lower cholesterol (Muscle Milk is only 5% per serving) and MUCH better taste."
2,"outdated, spiritless","I bought this and thought it was OK but then I saw my friend's Let's Go Israel. It's much much much much much better in every way, and it was pub'd in 2003. Get it instead."
5,The best and most practical baking book ever.,"I have had this book for years and just bought a few more for friends now on Amazon...as they say my copy and wanted it!..I have had it since my years ago working in one of the properties that the book takes some recipes from! And it is my favourite baking book, I have made most of the recipes from it, I have made almost all the browon bread recipes to find my favourite one is Ashford Castles one and also Mary Ann's one too! The yoghurt loaf recipe and the Banana Bread (one with marmalade, Cashel House I think) are amazing!... I have a friend who swears by he Chocolate and Hazlenut cake..there's a picture of it in the book. Georgina Campbell is a great cookery writer, fantastic recipies. If you like baking and want traditional Iris and practical recipes, this is the book for you. I wold highly recommend it! Buy it! and happy baking! Fiona"
5,Judo in the U.S. : A Century of Dedication,"A wonderful book on the history of Judo in the U.S. Full of pictures that is only printed in this book. Well written and documented for those who want to know more about this fasinating Olympic sport, Martial art & science of Judo."
4,Helped me understand US judo organizations,"This is a very nice history of judo in the US, with lots of interesting pictures of early literature, photos, and the like. One thing that I really liked about the book is that it explains the history and politics of the various judo organizations in the US, which had always been a mystery to me."
2,"Interesting, but not factual, and not a good how-to manual","This book is interesting for serious dance collectors, but for the average person, it is both too detailed, and too inaccurate.Several of the author's assertions are patently untrue: for example, linking the Dance of the Seven Veils to the myth of Ishtar, the Babylonian Goddess. It is also never advisable to learn anything physical solely from written instructions (The end of the book contains instructions for performing certain dance moves). A far better basic book is ""The Belly Dance Book"" edited by Taz Richards."
2,RESTRAINT SYSTEM HAS A HUGE FLAW!!!!!,"i'm so bummed that this carseat is not the quality i expected and hoped it would be. we bought this for our 14 month old son because of the rave reviews and tons of personal recommendations. while very comfy and fits tightly in the vehicle, the restraint system has a huge problem. the lap belt goes on my sons upper thighs, not his hips! if we were to get in an accident this could cause dislocation of his legs. like my husband says ""it's just basic physics"". i can't believe this seat is considered the *best* and i've only read one other review that mentioned this problem. nonetheless, i'm am taking it back tomorrow. we will test the marathon to see if it is a different restraint system, but if not, we will have to find something else. again though, it baffles me that no one else has mentioned this problem!!!!!"
2,"Color ink perfect, black ink -a NIGHTMARE",Amazon price was the cheapest I could find on line. There were a lot of good reviews so I ordered. The color cartridge works perfectly but the black cartridge smears are the text. Its dispensing too much ink. I need to replace the black cartridge now. Its too late to return. So I will take the lost. This is the first time I receive a defected product from Amazon.
1,Sucks!,"I think the deal is a fraud, there are only few drops in the cartridge!And after few prints, it doesn't work with my printer and shows the cartridges are not of orginal."
5,Lexmark x8350 Cartridge Bundle,The Lexmark x8350 Cartridge Bundle is a wonderful value. Purchasing these separately would be much more expensive. Its very easy to change the cartridges when the easy-to-read ink level lets me know the ink is getting low. I would highly recommend this product and the x8350 printer.
4,Deluxe instructions would be nice,"The instructions on these slings could use some work. I got mine on and it comes with 3 attachment items 2 nylon straps and a nylon rope with plastic attachment. The nylon straps are the best IMHO but now that i have the 3 point sling, i am just going to make a single point to allow for easier transition to my reaction hand."
1,Won't Fit Gamo Silent Cat,"I tried various ways to get this sling fitted on a Gamo Silent Cat but I was really not happy with the fit. And, the way the belts are configured, it's a real pain to adjust. You end up with a buckle digging in your shoulder. Just not a good sling for me."
2,Not such a great textbook.,"I used this book as a textbook in a class. I feel that it is not really that strong of a book for most introductory polymer courses. I feel that either Alcock's book for a course stressing systhesis and characterization or Heimetz's book for courses stressing polymer physics are better. Of all the polymer books on my shelf, it is probably the least useful to me now. It is at the right level for begining students, but there are better choices for beginners out there."
2,Not the best gift.,This was a gift to a lover. All the other toys I've bought her seem to be fine. This one was too tough for her and she left it behind. Maybe this is a more advanced toy?
3,Not everything we were hoping for,"While the cone does have lot of functions and can add good vibes to any intimate setting, using it is cumbersome and awkward. It's much larger than you might think and finding a comfortable position to use it in is difficult. While their website and brochure show several ways, most of these involve a chair or the floor - not for the bed. If you're more traditional in the bedroom and are looking for a massager to just add to your experience, I wouldn't start this product."
2,"Faulty backs, less gold","The stones looked good but the metal is a little whimpier than what amazon pictured.I only give it 2 stars because the backs did not fit snug enough to keep the earrings on and one fell out the first day I wore them. So due to the faulty backs I no longer have a pair of earrings. I emailed to see if I could return just the one, and they did get right back to me, but with a no. They did say however that I could purchase one for $14.57 plus shipping by calling them... not worth it!"
5,Excellent basic coffee maker,"I've had this coffee pot for about 5 years and I really love it. It brews quickly, is easy to pour, and the carafe is easy to clean. I've broken several carafes just being clutsy, but have always chosen to order a new carafe rather than buy a new coffee pot. I recently bought a new coffee pot just because I thought this one was geting too old, but I was quickly dissatisfied with my new model and will now be ordering more VB12's. Like another reviewer said, the coffee is not scalding, but definitely still has to cool before I can drink it. What I like is that it is sufficiently cooled within about 5 mins, rather than the 15-20 mins required by hotter coffee makers."
4,Interesting book by Ms. Woolf's nephew,"I read this book years ago and found it quite interesting. The author is the son of Virginia's sister Vanessa Bell, who was an accomplished painter and a memBer of the Bloomsbury Group. As a family member, he has insights an outsider probably wouldn't have."
5,A great cd if your open to new things,"This cd is extremly enjoyable if you can stand more than one type of music. The tribute songs sound very close to the original. I like it more than the original, by far."
5,A very revealing book,I have been stuck in a rut with my painting. This book has given me a new outlook on how I can express myself. The book is easy to understand and gave me detailed advise on how to accomplish my goals. I paricularly enjoyed her descriptions of her thought process involved in her paintings.
3,Blackstrobe - Burn Your Own Church,"Though I wish Arnaud Rebotini would return to his Zend Avesta project, Blackstrobe really isn't too terrible. Sure, BURN YOUR OWN CHURCH, shows off its rock swagger and axe-grinding right away with ""Brenn Di Ega Kjerke."" The darkness continues on ""Shining Bright Star,"" with Rebotini's vocals channeling the Sisters of Mercy, and the angry electro-grind pounds its way into ""Blood Shot Eyes."" The country-rock-blues of ""I'm A Man"" actually is quite a bit of fun, even if Alabama 3 got there first. The combination of electronics and black metal has always been an uneasy one, and even if Blackstrobe can't pull it off 100% (""Last Club On Earth,"" for instance, goes on a bit too long without coming to a head; ""Crave For Speed"" grinds away by doesn't go anywhere), they put in a darn good effort. The electronics on ""Buzz Buzz Buzz"" are quite catchy and perhaps shows Rebotini where his strengths really lie."
2,Transitional object.,I bought this prior to starting my first psychiatry job but never found it particularly useful. It refers to USA management so if you're not working in the USA it will have limited applicability. Some of the management suggested is pretty gung-ho and not very practical. Essentially this book acted as a security blanket for my first few weeks on on call but was never really used in practice. It could be used to study acute management of emergency situation but there are other books around which are better for this.
5,Music for mamas and babies,"My close friend titled my birthday copy of this album, ""Music for Mamas and Babies."" And I, the mama, have played and sung the album with my two children and by myself every day for days at a time. The words that come to mind -- harmony, happiness, thinking, learning, singing -- may be words that you like to hear. Then you would also like to hear a new version of ""Cumbaya,"" a story about the children's song of Ono, Africa, how to fall in love ""two by two,"" and how to make a drum. Sweet Honey's vocal harmonies, unique arrangements, accapella performances, non-accapella performances, commitment to equality, and rich story-telling make this an album to listen to past the time your babies are babies."
2,Love/Hate without Skid?,"I bought this album as soon as I saw it, a new Love/Hate album - fantastic! Unfortunately, Love/hate without Skid is like the Beatles without John Lennon. This album is good, don't get me wrong, but 30 minutes is more like a single, and there are only one or two tracks that catch the imagination, ""don't play your guitar.."" is a great song, and ""uncle said"" is pretty good, but the rest just doesn't hit the same spot as the ""Blackout.."" and ""Wasted.."" tracks. In fact, this is the worst album to be flaunted under the Love/Hate banner. Still, if you like Love/Hate, like me, you'll buy it and make your own mind up....."
2,Game Programming 500 page overview,"As previously mentioned, the book is basically an overview.However, it did assist me when I was researching a choice for a programming language (Python). The book shows the pro's, con's, and example syntax which is its best point. The book also mentioned successful projects using a particular language. I was able to check out this book at CompUSA before they closed. I cant recommend purchasing the book for more than a few bucks, but it would be worth a trip to the library or ebook view. You could get the same results by using Wikipedia."
3,The Best Of Final Fantasy,"I can still find some cool FF songs in it, even though they are different and strange. They sound more like MIDIs. Anyway, if you are a die hard FF fan, then you should probably check this album out. But if you are a FF newbie, I suggest you to order the Original Soundtrack. Because you will get a misconception of what the FF songs REALLY sound like."
3,Not bad....,"I can understand why some people may have written bad reviews for this CD. The quality of the music isn't highly praisable, and it does sorta sound like a guy in a garage with a synth. However, it does have some good tracks, and at [the price] who can argue? I do recommend this cd to any Final Fantasy music fans."
4,Nice Deal,I really like the music in Final Fantasy. Some guy wrote a review saying how bad this CD is. But I've enjoyed I very much. For around ... you get a professional CD with some well known pieces on it. The only annoying part is where they take Fithos Lusec and turn it into blah-blar blar-brr.
2,"Missleading, Upsetting, Unworthy of The FF Name","My GOD. Where do I start? Um...let's see....DON'T BUY THIS EVER! Completely disreguard any review that calls this CD orchestrated. This is all synthiesized. All electronic, and poor quality electronic, too. A couple tracks are tolerable at best (my reason for giving this 2 Stars instead of 1), but the rest...God, I'm so upset I can't even see straight! Liberi Fatali, one of the best pieces of FF ever, has been destroyed and tainted by this disgrace of a CD. Even if the sound quality on this CD came REMOTELY close to sounding good, the music has no variation to the music in the games. Besides different electric instruments, the music is exatcly the same. I own almost every CD that bears the FF name, and I can tell you that this is BY FAR the worst. Avoid at all cost. FF fans- stay away!! FF Music newcomers- do not take this music as a true representation of FF music. The real stuff is MUCH better."
5,Tag Formula 1 watch,I've had my Tag since May 25th of this year (2007) I love this watch. I get compliments everywhere I go. It looks great for dress or for play. I suggest this watch for men of all ages.
2,The book to skip,"After reading the Hiram Key, I was all to excited to run on down to a local store and buy this book. It is informative to a point, but the author has gone so deep into his own exhaustive personal experience that I found it almost unreadable.Great author but this book is one to skip unless you prefer absolute tedium."
1,more backlash....,"The title of this book proves to me the soundness of Susan Faludi's arguments. This book and it's sentiment promote the myth that there are ""no good men left."" It's a sentiment designed to drive women back into the kitchen and out of the workforce. There seems to be some misconception that women NEED a man. The truth is, that the one person who truly benefits from marriage is the man."
4,"don't listen to the negatives, see for yourself",not a lot to say here except for this movie is good and refreshing. My husband and I watched it recently and were dually impressed with both the acting and storyline. Dennis Quaid can carry a movie and it was nice to have to think and follow along with an indie. Horsemen is not mindless torture porn if that is your forte.
1,Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs,"Predictable story, annoying characters (Ziyi Zhang), miscast, ... Everything was wrong with this one. Why do they even bother releasing a DVD???"
1,Worse than CSI and Criminal Minds combined!,"A ""B"" movie with a normally good main actor. But, that is the GOOD news. The graphic violence is not well documented in many reviews. This is a sick movie without a single redeeming factor. If you choose to watch this movie, please send the kids to bed. The creators of this movie are probably as sick as the movie they created - no doubt for shock value, but, hey, I like Halloween. This is sordid, sick and should be shredded! It could actually help sick people become violent, in my opinion. YUK!"
4,Under rated,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I remember watching it and thinking I was surprised that more people hadn't seen it. The violence isn't gratuitious like the Saw movies etc but it is pretty gruesome in parts. So if that's not your cup of tea, you should probably skip this. I liked the mystery of the case and seeing the pieces come together."
3,"It was okay,but...","the surprise ending turned on something that didn't make sense, because of the younger of the detective's sons. I won't say what it was, but made the ending not very believable. Also not believable was Zhang Ziyi's role. But it was a pretty good acting job by Dennis Quaid, and altogether not that bad, just could have been a lot better.I should add, there is one moment that is absolutely chilling and had me on the edge of my seat, and that doesn't happen too often. This might work better if called a horror flick instead of a cop movie, which was I think what the cover copy said. Different expectations. As a horror film, it's not bad."
3,;0/,"I just finish watching this movie and I'm split in the middle it's not bad and it's not good, sometimes it became a little depressing and sad with a little tip of concussion. Although I was not overly impressed it's still watchable but it's not a movie I would sit down to re watch again. Dennis Quaid character was ok in the role have seen more impressive work from him not his best but still passable"
1,picture is misleading,The picture of these buffing tools is misleading. There is also no description of the size of these buffers. They are much larger than depicted. You will not be able to fit even the smallest/narrowest buffer into an area less than an inch and a half. I could not fit any of these into the 6 twin spokes of my aluminum wheels which have about 1 inch between them. Only good for large open areas. I returned them.
4,"Polishing out the old, buffing in the new...","The buffing and polishing kit was just what the drill ordered! My car was in the shop hoisted in the air, so I decided to revive the shine, in my exhaust cans...the different size polishing/buffing heads worked wonders!!!!"
2,Self Destructs,"Very first use on chrome wheels, it self destructs. It flings off pieces to never never land. Dissappointed in this product."
2,my bad,"my fault, not exactly what i was looking for!thought they went on the fog lights place, instead of the middle center!also did not know they are xenon lights!"
1,Cheesy,"Scientist is probably the best dub artist out there. However, this CD doesn't ever get a groove going like some of his earlier stuff.Try these instead.1.Scientist Rids The World Of The Curse Of The Evil Vampires2.Scientist Meets the Space Invaders"
4,Images flew to my mind,"What is home? What is culture? How adaptable are we - at what point can we no longer adapt? What is beauty and what is art - imagine a beach full of living drawings, standing side by side in welcome.I love how the cover of this book is sparse as opposed to the story which filled my mind with amazing images - images that moved and a still life of moments to be remembered,pain, sorrow, joy and tenderness.As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a book that will stay with the reader for a long time."
5,This Gun is Awesome what a Steal !,"I brought this gun last week and it arrived in 3 days ! (A for hotimporttoys's shipping) I open it and check it out, WOW very heavy on hand, feels like real and lots of metal parts. Then go for test run, got a nice high cap mag. This gun is STRONG ! definately 350fps with 0.12g and about 300 with 0.2 g bb. All I can say is this gun under $100 is a steal ! get it before it runs out!"
4,RONSTADT Steals The Show,"This dvd is well remastered all the way around. Johnny Cash's performances are all excellently executed, and his guests keep the flow of his ""show"" running at a nice pace throughout. Johnny Cash was wise to include his friend LINDA RONSTADT, who at the time was riding the wave of her near breakthrough Lp, ""Don't Cry Now"". Already introducing her unique and powerful version of ""You're No Good"" onstage to her audiences, Ronstadt performs four of her classic selections with her superbly well suited five piece band, and it is she who is the focal point of the show. Visually enchanting, confident and mesmerizing as a ""live"" singer, Ronstadt's onstage presence remains that of a shy girl, but appears to enjoy her short time onstage. This is a rare onstage view of the most famous and successful female rock singer the 1970's."
3,Linda Ronstadt is incredible,"I bought this DVD because it's the only DVD I know of that captures a live perfomance by Linda Ronstadt. I liked Johnny Cash and the other performers, but for me, Linda justifies the cost of this DVD. The live version of ""Love Has No Pride"" will send shivers up your spine. Contrary to another reviewer, it doesn't sound to me at all as if she's ""wagging her finger"" at the audience in ""Desperado"". Maybe on ""You're No Good""...anyway, if you want to hear Linda do incredible versions of four of her best songs, buy this DVD. The sound isn't perfect (""aircraft hanger"" comes to mind), but it's passable and you can still hear the nuances of her voice."
3,"Sadly, Replete with Inaccuracies","Although extremely well written, much of this book's ""history"" of the last century is completely inaccurate. Simply put, most of the events chronicled did not occur. The book is entertaining, but I wish the authors had performed even the most rudimentary fact-checking"
3,Great satire...,"Definitely an amusing read if you're in tune to the goings on of the past 100 years. If not, well, many of the references may be over your head. The ""front page"" newspaper format can be more difficult to read than a standard novel and the book certainly lends itself to flipping around interesting headlines. Still, a lighthearted book and a nice gift for your history buff friends."
3,Simpsons is fun! But tough!!!,"Great game! I love all the voices from different characters throughout the game. It's like being in a episode from the Simpsons. With it's own story just for this game. I have to admit, this game is kinda tough. It's a video game! I guess that's what they do. It makes you frustrated playing the same level over and over because they are so hard. But nevertheless get this game. It's a great addition to your Wii games collection!"
3,Art of East Asia,"I ordered this book on the recommendation of an Amazon customer review. However, I returned it because it is just a HUGE book, that is, much too heavy to hold comfortably and read. It does has lovely,colored illustrations and the text material was suitable even though, as was observed by a previous Amazon reviewer, it does not include India. In the end I ended up buying an updated (1980s), used copy of Sherman Lee's basic book on Asian art which, after all these years (c. 1963), still seems to be the best choice for a comprehensive history of the topic."
4,"Works fine, but very shallow socket..","As the other reviewer described, the socket is extremely shallow.. Like, just over 1 millimeter deep. You can see a white plastic insert which is used to hold a magnetic stud (also 1mm in diameter). The plastic insert is maybe 2mm down, but the magnet protrudes into the opening by nearly 1mm. If, like me, you are using this for computer stand-offs, this magnet won't be in your way; however, this may be an issue for someone else. On another note, the shaft is all of 6 inches, as described.BTW, if you are looking to use this for computer stand-offs, i recommend getting the 5mm nut driver instead (or in addition to); it fits a much larger number of standoffs, where this only fits american-made ones.ALL-IN-ALL, this works fine for me, but be warned of how shallow the socket opening is."
3,very shallow,"nice long handle with a rubber grip, works great to adjust router from above table in place of 30 dollar porta cable model. This does same job as specialty tool. Works good,but depth of socket end very shallow, but does the job"
5,Finaly a real Hard SCI-FI,Finaly i read a book where the author is not afraid to handle the difficult problems concerning Space-travel. It was also very refreshing to see so many of Stephen Hawkings theories were incorporated into this book. The best Hard Sci-Fi ever written
2,I never used it,"I think I threw my copy away, it was so basic. but to each his own, Also it was outdated."
3,Tennis Aide,"I purchased these on a reconmendation of a fellow tennis player. I really never wear sunglasses except to the beach. So, honestly, getting used to wearing them was my biggest obstacle.My first try wearing them was at night under the lights. I managed to the ball well, but other things were too dark. Not recommende to that. Dytime in the sun, not cloudy worked best. They take away the glare and emphasize the ball. Peoples skin look like they are grey and dying. Other colors change too, such as the ""red"" court ,now brown. That aspect I did not like about the glasses. As a result, I hardly wear them. Oh, I think the price of them, is really too high for a pair of sunglasses. They are NOT scratch proof and for that price I think they should be.Service by Amazon was great."
1,Lenses always fell out,The glasses came with the blue lenses installed. When we removed the blue lenses and installed the grey lenses the lenses would not stay in the frames. They seemed to fit well until we tried to put the glasses on; then the flex of the frames caused the lenses to pop out and drop to the floor. Totally useless.
5,Inflatable Mannequin--Just what I was looking for.,Received promptly and was pleasantly surprised. The mannequin is just what I needed for my display. What is so nice is that I can deflate it and take it everywhere and inflate it again. It also compacts into a small space for storage. Great item. Thanks
2,a cover song lovers dream,"I am disappointed that they couldn't get these kids some new songs.. ""One Step Closer"" was originally done by S Club Juniors who are now known as S Club 8.. but S Club 7 never did well over here, so SC8's management, who also happens to be AJ's management, is just recylcing their songs for the kind of American clone of the S Club 8.. just less people.. but whatever.. it wasn't absolutely dreadful"
4,Orcs!,"This is a great book!It however is not of the traditional fantasy line of band of adventurers meet up and head off to right the wrongs of the world. This book pokes fun at all the traditional boring fantasy plotlines that are to be found in 100's of fantasy novels.It is adult oriented, it is not meant to be believable and it's all about orcs running amok.If you want to read book 18 of the Shannara series or another book that tells the same story Tolkien told 40 years ago pass this one by but if you want to read a crazy ""what if"" style novel about orcs butchering the forces of light for once, dig in!"
4,Very funny and different look at a Good vs. Evil story.,"This book is different in that it is written from the dark sides perspective instead of good. The story is very entertaining and always takes unexpected turns. Mary Gentle is very ""down to earth"" with her writing in that she doesn't hold back describing in gory detail what is happening. Many authors nowadays seem to be aiming for a broader audience (teens and adults) and therefore are less descriptive so as to not offend. Very good book."
2,Cover is the Best Part,"Was really hoping for better. Calling it satire unfairly besmirches the term satire. It's just a very juvenile effort, maybe something that might have been written by Beavis & Butthead if they were slightly more literate, or maybe a National Lampoon dropout. If a confused and slow storyline, and descriptions of Orc sex are what you are looking for, then this is for you. Kept reading thinking that it surely had to get better but never did. Don't say I didn't warn you."
2,"Like some other reviewers said...good concept, but a boring read","Painful read...boring and slow. I tried to finish this fast because I don't like leaving books unfinished but I just couldn't read more than a few pages at a time before I became to bored to continue. At no point did I feel remotely interested in the plot, characters or outcome.Disappointing because I like Orcs being portrayed differently to their usual cliched roles. I think a much better book with Orcs as the main characters is Stan Nicholl's Orcs trilogy. I read the omnibus edition with all 3 books in one and enjoyed it.Unfortunately that didn't have Orcs with guns. If thats important to you, there are Warhammer 40K ""Orks"" to check out =)"
2,2 and a 1/2 stars,"Wow.. What to say about this book..It has a great premise. How fun could it be to give a bunch of Orces modern day weapons and let them run amok?Sounds great doesn't it?That is what I thought also, sadly the book isn't very good.The author blew a great chance at having a killer book but sadly it just didn't live up to its promise."
3,Soo Small compared to others,"I bought this item for my son's birthay, he's 5and compared to the hulk tent that his 2 year old brother busted it's sooo tiny. it's pretty durable in the fact that when it collapses it's pretty easy to snap back into place, but i just don't like the fact that it's soo small."
1,JUNK!,My son received this as a gift and it is pure JUNK! The supports are difficult to get in and don't always stay in...he is only interested in taking the support poles out and using them as a baseball bat (major hazard!)...on top of that the split opening at one end doesn't have a way to secure it so it stays open....Don't buy it--it's junk...many other play houses are better for the $$$.
2,Rip-Off!,"This is simply a rip-off of the book Dragons Versus Dinosaurs by G. L. Strytler. That book placed dinosaurs and mammoths together for entertainment purposes, and this DVD does no different. The mere fact that this was released a year or two after that book is a dead give away that the producers of this film are cashing in on the wave of success from that story without wanting to shell out a few extra dollars to buy the movie rights. To that end-- very predictable!"
4,Cool,"This comic is so cool! The lettering is great, the characters do things that they would have done in the movies, and they look exactly the same. The plot is new, but it's possible. It also is faithful to Star Wars. The comic is a must read."
3,Good for one time viewing or for serious collecting,"For the collector this version of Cleopatra is unique and of course adds also to the Cecil collection. It is filmed in black and white. The actors barely into talkies over emotionalize every chance they get. Cleo had to cram the rubber snake to her bosom with a stabbing force. There are a few Shakespeare quotes. And the sets are from the 30's. That may be because it was made in 1934. However I expected King Kong to come out from behind the curtain at any time.After getting over the shock of the accents and costumes and gesticulations, it was fun to watch Cleo (Claudette Colbert) vamping Anthony (Henry Wilcoxon.) You felt like saying, ""Look out Anthony!"" And the battle scenes must have taken the lion's share of the budget. So try to make it past the beginning and you may wonder why it is over so soon.I was compelled to write this review on the Ides of March.Cleopatra ~ Elizabeth Taylor"
2,boring,this book was for a college course. i think if the course would've been better then the book may have seemed better. i ended up keeping the book because no one wanted to buy it.
3,"Great pictures, but the video's suck!","I love the pictures that this little camera takes, it is a perfect camera because it is nice and light and fits in my purse so I can take it everywhere. I have taken some wonderful pictures of my children with it. But any time that I have tryed to take a in door video clip it is so dark you can hardly make it out. If it the video's were clear and not so dark the camera would be perfect and I would give it 5 stars."
1,Stay away from Olympus,"I regret having to give this camera even ""1"" star. I see someone else below has had the same problem as me. It is a cheap camera case and Olympus will not stand behind their warranty. Unless you want to hire an attorney to enforce your warranty rights and waste your money on an inferior camera, I recommend that you spend your money on a sturdy and dependable camera such as Canon. Olympus is a waste of time and money."
2,a little disappointed,"This product arrived and looked beautiful. However, if you're actually going to use the tea kettle and not just have it for display, you have to go through this process of removing all the wooden pieces and placing it in a large pot of boiling water and baking soda to remove the lacquer film. I had to do this process twice and still had problems removing it. Even after removing the film, the kettle becomes discolored when you heat water in it. While the price is very attractive compared to other copper kettles I've seen, the old saying of ""you get what you pay for"" probably applies here. I'm using the kettle, but I can tell it's not something that will last a long time. Next time I'll make the investment for a better product."
2,Extrememly disappointing.,Somewhat inspirational but not enough practical detailed information.I didn't like the author's attitude of superiority.
1,Confucius and the Role of Reason,Powells sent me another book. I informed them that's a wrong book and was told the item Amazon put on line wasn't matched in the catalogue. However they gave me the refund. Big deal. Anyway thanks for your service.
2,Better than Ambien,"It was very difficult for me to stay awake during Rabbi Wein's lectures.Perhaps, another speaker might have made it more interesting."
4,You can't lose with Michener,"Legacy is a well-written book that tells the story of a family and their involvement in the making of this country. The whole book is centered on our completely original and truly wonderful constitution, and how it governs our country.I'll admit this is not Michener at his very best, but don't let that stop you from reading the book. It is well worth it.The description on the insert describes the book as ""a powerful story to be read in an evening and remembered for a lifetime.""Most of Michener's books that are more than worth reading and this is one is no exception. As for the ending, I think that it is proper because it stays in tune with the entire novel."
3,Good Flavor - too fine a grind,"The flavor of this jerky is great, but I didn't expect that it would be more of a powder than something identifiable as a meat product. It is very messy though it tastes good."
1,Hate the powder,"I expected small pieces of jerky but not powder. I am really disappointed, my dogs love it, they will knock it off the table and eat the whole thing, but it is alittle expensive for them."
4,Better then the real thing!,"I received a whole box of the Teriyaki flavored chew for my Birthday, and have eaten one, sometimes two cans per day since. When it's fresh,like mine was, it is so good. IF you like Beef jerky you will love this stuff. Try it, you will seet what I'm talking about."
2,Would be better if it wasn't expired.,"My shipment was all over 2 months overdue. Too much flavor lost by then, and too dry."
1,ferrari,i was disappointed that this was an un painted model. paint cost more than the model. i bought a nice metal one for less.
4,The Title is Fitting,This is indeed a peaceful Christmas album. I tend to listen to songs I recognize for the holidays so not every song is my favorite but the album as a whole is very nice.
3,not up to Fisher Price standards,"I bought this for my granddaughter who is 3 and is such a backyardigans fan. However, at the same time I bought Uniqua and Tyrone singing playpals by a different company. Pablo from Fisher Price looked like he had been laundered several times and is smaller than the other two. My granddaughter plays constantly with the other two, but continues to keep Pablo, face down and ""sleeping"". I was disappointed."
2,Bad fit for us,"I was given a gift certificate to use toward a Baby Bjorn, but I decided to save some money and get a Snugli. By the time I figured out the straps (it took two people!), my son was quite annoyed. Once we put him in it, he looked awkward and uncomfortable in it, like the back was too high and flappy. I felt like I needed to hold my baby up. I thought it would save time when going to the mall, but by the time I got it on, I was frustrated and ready to go home.My advice: Try on both the Snugli and Baby Bjorn BEFORE you buy. The Snugli was a bad fit for both me and my son. The Bjorn was a much better fit for us. I you want a Bjorn, try EBay. I got a like-new Baby Bjorn for $40."
2,Disappointing,"I have tried to use this carrier a dozen times, but to no avail. My good-natured son cries and cries in what seems to be discomfort. Though he's only 11 lbs, my shoulders ache after having him in it for only minutes--I guess the straps are not padded enough. I thought I would be saving money by purchasing a Snugli instead of a Baby Bjorn! I gave it two stars because it was easy to set up and it positions nicely--just didn't work out for us. I recommend trying it out at the store before purchasing."
5,Great product... can't beat the price,"I LOVE this carrier. When the baby is getting fussy, I throw him in the carrier and I do the house work. And to go shopping, its great b/c you don't have to worry about a bulky stroller. I love all the adjustments. It fits much like a good backpack. And the baby is so comfy in it. For the price, you can't beat it!"
1,You've Got To Be Kidding Me!,"I had read the great reviews and registered for the Snugli. I was so excited to try this with my daughter, but was quickly discouraged. I adjusted it according to the directions, but it still really wasn't comfortable and getting a squirmy newborn in the seat is another project! I tried this several times making different adjustments with my husband's help, but was not satisfied. I should have known it was going to be a hassle when reading the reviews that basically restated how to adjust all the straps. I eventually returned the Snugli and purchased the Premaxx sling. One slip over my head and baby is in-no clips and no need for an extra set of hands. I definitely recommend taking the different carriers out of their boxes and trying them on before purchasing or registering for one."
2,Impossible to put on alone,"This product looks great but it's not worth purchasing for Moms / Dads who are home alone as it's very difficult to snap buckles on the back and get baby into the carrier. I've tried multiple ways of getting the baby in the carrier and it's very inconvenient. In fact, I've not used the Snugli because it's too cumbersome to put on. Before purchasing, be sure to try this product out at a baby store (preferably with baby) so you can see if it will work for you."
4,She finally stopped crying!,"I purchased this item after trying to figure out how to use a nojo babysling and giving up. SO, I took back the sling and purchased this carrier based on the reviews writen here.My baby has been suffering from colic, and needs to be held constantly to calm down and stop crying. I purchased this item this morning, came home and put her in it, and as I am typing this, she is still snoring away in it. The reason I am only giving this 4 stars is because it is a little difficult for me to snap the sides in place with her in it.I highy recommend this product, trust me, you won't regret it!"
2,beware of the less expensive Snugli carrier,"We received this Snugli carrier as a gift. We are first time parents and just focused on the price compared to Baby Bjorn. What could be so much better, right? Well first when our baby was a newborn she did not like how long it took to get her into the carrier. It was very frustrating trying to hold her and get the carrier fastened up. Plus another thing we forgot to consider is how it fits us. I can't use it and my husband barely can. He wears a size M or L shirt. I highly recommend trying them on in the store."
2,Too many straps,"When I put this carrier on, I felt like I was going backpacking in the Amazon or something. It was uncomfortable and I just couldn't take having to adjust all those straps. The material is a bit rough too. My husband is tall and bigger, and after I finally had the carrier adjusted to me, he then had to readjust it for himself. We ended up trying many different carriers on at Target and the most comfortable one was the Bjorn...Sad to say, because it's so $$$. We ended up returning this one and getting a used Bjorn on EBAY. When I got it, it looked practically new. You don't use a carrier for very long and so getting the used one and it being the BEST and most comfortable... I was thrilled with my ebay purchase."
5,perfect fit 2001 f150 4x4 supercrew,"this was the hardest part of the job, i replaced the uppers too, get a bearing press, the job cannot be done without it, also get the adjusting bolts for the uppers, there is a video on the web that will walk you through it[...] if you need to see video, serch ball joint replacement"
2,The bipod that needs to hit the gym!,"I have had this bipod for sometime and used it on two rifles. Let's just say it really needs to work on its legs (holding strength and stamina).At first I used it on an M&P; 15-22, and for that application its great .Theirs a good review by ""Bowlseye"" on this page that talks about using it with that rifle that I agree with.But as a bipod to be used on a rifle that fires 5.56, it gets weak in the knees. I used it on an M&P-15T;, as every round is fired one or both legs slowly goes down ,it just don't stay put! I even crank it down with a wrench and it stills moves.UTG Low-Profile Deluxe Bipod it will make you very happy with a .22lr platform. So for me its going back on the M&P; 15-22. For something of a higher caliber try something else, I will."
1,Needs better QC,"This is the 5th UTG bipod I have purchased. The first 3 were fine, however my last order of 2 bipods was problematic. The screw hole used to attach the threaded mount to the rifle were not drilled perpendicular to the cylinder of the threaded mount, which created an uneven surface, resulting in an inability to use it to mount the bipod to any rifle. I had to use a grinder to compensate for the non-perpendicular hole for the screw in order to get a flush mount. Very poor quality control. Disappointed."
5,UTG Low-Profile Deluxe Universal Picatinny & Swivel-Stud Bipod review,Wow. As good as I thought it would be. I mean about $20 and it does this well? Nice. Better than spending way more only to be afraid to get it scratched up. Right price. Perfect for my needs. I'd do it again. Check out a video review of it [...]
5,"Exactly as described, very durable/mobile","Using this on my current AR setup, easy attachment/removal onto the rail and the extended legs are a bonus plus add some cushion when aiming. Construction is good for something of this price range and I look forward to seeing what I can put it through."
3,I would go with the next step up from UTG,"This bipod feels cheap. I didn't expect much for the price but I am a little disappointed. I would have gone with the step up if I could do it again.Positives:Cheap priceeasy to adjust quicklytakes up little room on your accessory rail which makes it perfect for the sig 552extend length of the legsNegatives:Overall feel is cheapnot very sturdy, tends to wobblesometimes the legs extend out unexpectly"
4,No problems,"I read all the previous reviews for this printer, which were very useful in making my purchase decision. I have only had it for a month, but so far it has lived up to expectations with no problem. Setup was easy. The print speed is as advertised. Colors are vivid and color printing is actually quicker than I expected. For this price (I have seen it marked down to around $100) I don't think you can go wrong."
4,Good Deal,Enjoying my Canon PIXMA MP750. Have used it mostly as a copier and scanner. No complaints to date. Somewhat of a large unit but well worth the price.
3,"Unfortunately, a better text probably does not exist","The contents of this book fluctuate from the interesting and informative, to the staggeringly useless. The three sections of the book are as follows: 1) A general overview of various types of arbitrage which is quite good, but is punctuated with mundane irrelevancies about trade settlements and technical calculations of risk and return factors. 2) A section of algebraic masturbation intended to imply that you can actually quantify risk in an arbitrage portfolio. 3) Some examples of real-world arbitrage situations that are generally instructive, but not comprehensive enough. Overall I think this book was a good attempt, but is much more suited to a dry finance course than real-world application. Unfortunately, a better text probably does not exist."
4,Wonderful,One of my most favorite books of the series so far! I think this because of some of the mysteries that were finally revealed and the excitement!
5,Great read for kids.,"My granddaughter who is 11 years old, loves this series. She quickly reads one and can't wait for the next book to arrive. She loves the characters and roots for them. I highly recommend this series."
2,Wake me when the 13th book comes out....,"This was a really aggravating book. I sensed that there were attempts made to start tying all the loose threads up into a big black velvet bow, but it wasn't happening. The story wasn't advanced one single step further than it was in the last book. So I can't quite figure the raison d'etre for this book. I'm glad we borrowed it from the public library instead of spending our penultimate penny on our own copy.Definitely the most unimpressive book of the series."
5,the penultimate peril,"this book is influential because, it shows how the baudelaire orphans never give up no matter how bad the situation is.before I read the book i knew a little about it so i knew what was about to happen and i liked it, just as much as i did before I read it. I learned to never give up and good will come to you."
4,Will They Go On,"As this book was a good one I gave it a four out of five stars because at times it could be hard to follow. But other than that it was great. There are giant spatulas, harpoon guns, and ships in pools, also an eye-deceiving pond. The spatulas turn into rows, the man gets shot, the ship runs of the roof, and the pond turns out to be a mystery keeper. So if you can find it, a series of unfortunate events the penultimate peril number twelve, it's worth reading.(...)"
4,Interesting,"I thought this book was interesting. I've loved every book in this series and this is no exception. I love the style the the author uses. Especially how he can use big words and then give you the definition because chances are you don't know what it means. I really like how this isn't one of your average stories where something may go wrong but there is always a happy ending, not always having a happy ending seems more realistic to me. I would recommend this entire series to anyone."
3,Where is the real Lemony Snicket.,"This is what happens when a NOT so noble organization decides to hijack an idea for their own personal gain. What if the real Lemony Snicket was investigating a crime? What if this story were partially true, one day perhaps this series will be brought into court as evidence in a real trial and if that happens the authors (Yes this book was written by a commitee) will be held accountable for their actions. You can run but you can't hide. You have been committing a crime and are now covering up your actions by changeing the story to fit your needs and cicumstances. Enough said."
2,Not his best,This book was just auuuuuu. It went on and on and on and on and on about nothing. That's what I don't like anout Lemony Snicket(Daniel Handler) because he wants us to believe thathis life is so miserable and he wants us to feel sorry for him and his books. I didn't like this one very well. It lacked of... What do you call...??? Book!
5,Le` Second To Last,"This book was a very good book. I absolutely loved it. Lemony Snicket is a great author. The Series of Unfortunate events is one of the best series I've read. I sullenly say that there is only one more book in the series. The Penultimate Peril is about three orphans who disguise themselves as concierges to spy and observe people in the hotel. Their job is to differentiate between the noble and the villainous people visiting the Hotel Denouement and to find out who J.S. is. The evil Count Olaf doggedly chases the Baudelaire's down and finds them at the hotel. If you want to find out what happens, read the book yourself!"
1,not good,"I thought the movie would feature Joan Collins and her male co-star's character as the only storyline and feature in the movie.The sex scene was boring.Most of the story centered on the other teen stars' characters.I've seen Joan Collins in other good movies,but this one is NOT GOOD."
1,Dramatic price increase since January 2012,"I bought two of these note pads in January 2012 at $3.58 each. Now they are $10.74 with a ""list price"" of $93. Very odd. Hopefully this is just a data entry glitch. Needless to say I will look elsewhere."
5,Amazing,"If you have read D. Lowry's books this is a great one to add to your collection, if you haven't even better. This is a great way for us barbaric westerners to understand the budo way of life. Great life lessons and things to ponder in this book."
2,good product but plan on regular maintenance,The keypad is a handy way to opening your garage door but using this product I have found that I had to at least three times a year clean the ribbon cable to keep it working. Unfortunately after cleaning this last time I am unable to remove what appear to be dark stains in the ribbon cable. Most likely it is water damage from the elements. I am bothered about paying near $25 for a new keypad when all I really need is the ribbon cable (which can't cost more than a dime) but the ribbon cable is attached in such a way that the entire thing needs to be replaced.A useful product but poorly designed thus the two star rating I am giving it.
5,Genie Garage Door Opener,"Arrived quickly, easy to install, numbers are easy to read and they give nice feedback when pressing them. Works well with no problems so far."
5,Old model Genie garage door opener keypad replacement,"Replaced a worn out one just like it...easy to install and works great. Tried other universal brands, but they did not work."
5,Keypad Replacement,This was exactly what I needed to return my door opener to its original status. My old key pad was worn to the amount that you could tell what the code was.
4,Amazingly accurate and insightful,"Dr. Sherry's unique humor and his insighful wit made this book a pleasure to read. It's obvious that Dr. Sherry is a man of values, courage, and spontaneity. I applaud Dr. Sherry for his efforts in really bringing to light the activism portrayed in the chronicle. While Sherry's other works were ""farcicle,"" this one has all the makings of a gem.My only concern is that this book is repetitive and obligatory at times. Dr. Sherry, you might want to be aware of this in future publications."
3,"The good, bad and ugly","The good part is Ed McCabe gives a fascinating view into what has to be the most masochistic race on earth. While the author spends too much time describing his preparation, he also does a masterful job of detailing the amount of work required to even attempt this endeavor. The bad part is McCabe's personality - angry, arrogant, obsessive, perfectionistic. The ugly is the writing - there are some glaring errors and it looks like McCabe decided he could be his own editor. Wrong! A good editor could have made this a much better read - nonetheless it's still a fascinating first-hand description of a race only a maniac would enter. Most pathetic -- after a nearly a year of preparation and a penchant for obsession over details, McCabe blew it by running out of gas. Since his car eventually made it to Dakar it seems he could actually have run the course if only he'd topped off that morning."
1,"OMG they can't really be serious, can they?","This was a comedy, but not intensionally I am sure. Marc Walberg's overacting is way, way, WAY over the top. They could have made the story at least interesting, but nope, it was worst than Walberg's acting. The mentally insane (liberals) will probably make a sequal to this called The Grass Whisperer LOL>This film must be one of the most embarassing things to ever had been made."
1,One of the worst movies of all time.,"Anything that is interesting or exiting in this movie happens in the first fifteen minutes. It is all down hill from there. It was laughably bad. At the moments when I wasn't chuckling where I wasn't suppose to be I was contemplating leaving the theater.All in all the ""moral"" of the story is that humans are bad and that the earth would like to kill us. Being a human, and liking myself for it, I find this irritating. Save yourself some money and go watch a B horror movie. At least you may see some naked ladies and at least the monster will be killed."
1,"Like someone mentioned Cool Concept, Bad Execution","The movie, was 1 of thee most terrible movies, I've ever seen in my lifetime. No that statement is ""not an exxageration"". M. Night Shamalan, I have no clue, on what he was thinking. The actors, are lucky to still have a job in hollywood after this. Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo. I hope the director of this movie bounces back from this, so anyone who says this movie was good, must believe bad movies are good in their eyes. I hope my 0 star rating will work."
1,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!,"Of all the movies I've seen in nearly 40 years of life, this one is THE WORST! Bad acting. Bad story. Bad premise. Bad ending. Just plain BAD! BAD! BAD!"
2,"Good Premise, But Poorly Written and Directed","I like the eco-concept behind this movie -- that we have screwed up the environment so badly that trees are starting to strike back as an evolutionary survival mechanism.But so much more could have been done with that fabulous premise!Instead, the director hides behind mild scenes of overhyped gore, terrible stage direction given to two decent actors (I am a HUGE fan of Zooey but she is wasted here), and misfired attempts at humor (the hot dog guy).I understand the ""flatness"" of the film is intended -- does that make it successful?Not to me.A story like this has to build, you need to have something driving the storyline, and all we have here are some bucolic scenes of trees flapping in the wind.Sorry but this is a major disappointment given the pedigree involved."
1,"Oh, The Horror!!!","This is an open plea to M. Night Shyamalan...please stop making movies until you realize that your perspective has become seriously compromised. Only someone totally wrapped up in their own legend would ignore/not recognize the serious flaws that make this movie a thorough waste. With a plot that strains all credibility, laughable dialogue, wooden performances (way to phone in your roles, Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel), and ridiculous special effects (i.e., the scene with the man in the lion pen), The Happening is a disaster from the opening frame to the ending credits.Others have noted the deterioration in the quality of Shyamalan's movies over the years as his ego has grown. The Happening is the final proof to all but the most devoted Shyamalan fans that his ego has exceeded his talent. While Shyamalan might get great pleasure in watching his movies, he'll soon be the only person watching them if he continues to make movies like The Happening."
1,An awful movie....,"Al Gore would probably like this movie, but Michelle Polk rates it at zero! A gory movie which made little sense. Oh, I get the whole propaganda theme but the movie itself was just stupid. Suicide after suicide is committed because the plants are angry with humans. It might make a good sci-fi book but to watch those scenes over and over was just too rough!"
1,1 star is too high!!,"I, like many others probably, bought this thinking that it looked pretty good...my dad and sister did the same thing...luckily my sister warned me before I opened my copy...and let me borrow hers instead. That was the best decision of my life!!!!! I am so disappointed. I'm trying to keep an open mind about it but it was just horrible. Mark Wahlbergs was very blan...I've always thought he's good...but not in this!If you feel the need to watch this even after reading the reviews PLEASE do you yourself a favor a rent it instead!"
2,"So bad, you gotta rent it so you can laugh!","I'm floored that Night keeps getting financing to make more films, with each being worse than the last. This one really takes the cake. You can't help laughing at the unbelievable dialogue which no one in real life would ever say, the not-scary plot twist, and the poor acting from people who would do better in other films and more likely with other directors.Gather your friends, rent this thing, sit back, and do a total Mystery Science Theatre 3000 on it. You will sneer, point, and scowl, but at least you'll have fun doing it."
5,The Happening,"Good suspence movie you don,t know who will die next, You hope the main characters don,t die."
1,this just sucks,"Don't waste your time. There is no interesting plot twists with like you would expect from M. Night Shyamalan. The acting is mediocre. The deaths are unnecessarily gory without any feeling of suspense or thrill with them. I do not feel like I got any deeper meaning or insight into the human condition from the time I spent with this movie. There are also several parts of the story that could have been expanded, but did not go anywhere. At the end it felt like there were a lot of lose ends that were never tied up. I am sorry I wasted my time."
2,Misleading Title,"The tile of this movie is very misleading, because NOTHING hapens. The plot is hard to get on board with, people make really stupid decisions, and you don't really get to know the main charecters that you are supposed to be rooting for. I had high hopes after viewing the trailers and was very disappointed. It seems that M Nights movies are progressivley getting worse."
2,Storyline is great. . . . but,"The storyline of this movie is fantastic, and it should have been able to get a 5 star rating. . . however, the acting of the main characters is really kind of pathetic. Slow, lethargic, disinterested - you name it. They attempt to hint at some troubles between them, other relationships are disconnected and odd and have little to do with the plot. Yes, with M. Knight - we expect more. He's done a number of movies that rate a 4 or 5, written, directed, whatever. . . but this one's about on par with the Village (and that was pretty dull too), however the Happening's story line is much better than the Village's. And I love Wahlberg - but jeez, what the heck happended?"
1,This movie sucked!,"The Happening is a complete utter disappointment! Please do not allow yourself to become pulled in by over hyped media promotion. It is clear that after M.Knight's three huge box office failures,he lacks an enormous amount of pure talent. Therefore, he continues to write solely depending on his name to pull in the box offer numbers! M.Knight, should take his time with creating a well produced film, the entire package."
5,Unique plot and good acting...,I don't know why most rated it low. I thought it was very good. A very interesting plot...
2,not alot really happening,I love psychological thrillers/horror but this... why? I ask. I wont give away any details incase you do buy it. I gave it a 2 star for the setting it gave but thats it. People just start falling over and the world goes crazy... end of story. Thats the movie sretched out into 1 1/2 hours. Old M. night needs to just go to sleep.
2,Isn't Happening,"When Shyamalan broke through with the Sixth Sense he was anointed as the next great director. Since then however, every succeding movie has been a struggle. It appears that the Sixth Sense was more of a wonderful fluke than a sign of things to come. The Happening falls short in many respects, including story line. There are many holes and non-sensical moments where continuity of the story is lost. The actors are fine in their roles, good even. But the story just gets lost and can't figure itself out. A shame. It's not a bad premise, just extremely poorly executed."
2,Mama Earth 1/ People 0,"I did enjoy this only as a movie. I did feel as though yet again I was being lectured by Hollywood. This is a movie that could have made by Greenpeace. The underlying message,"" We are committing suicide by destroying the planet."" I would like to watch a movie just for the entertainment vaule, not to be told how nefarious I am. And by the way, why does every person of faith have to be portrayed as complete nut case!!! The old hermit lady in ths last 25 minutes of the film. Watch it once, tell your friend you saw it, water your plants so they wont seek revenge on you, and leave it at that."
1,"Lame, Dumb, Waste of Money and Time","Don't even bother watching it. Glade i didn't waste my money to see this in theaters. I was extremely disappointed. The preview made the movie look good, where as a whole it was just awful. Reminds me of Lions for Lambs, both were awful and pretty pointless."
2,Warning - Truly Terrible Movie,"I just paid $6 to see this, and feel completely ripped off. I can't imagine paying $20 or $30...The woman playing Mark Walberg's girlfriend is the worst actress ever. I'm DONE with Shamalayan."
2,Decent Story... But,"I thought the overall story was pretty decent, but this movie suffered from poor writing and acting.I seriously couldn't tell if this movie was SUPPOSED to be bad, because most of the movie is like this. The dialogue exchanges throughout the entire film are just BAD. This was, like I said, due to poor writing by M. Knight and bad acting by pretty much everyone... but it makes you wonder if M. Knight intentionally made the movie like this for ""campyness"".Overall this movie does has some pretty frightening scenes, with the overall plot being honestly pretty good(the plants etc.).... but the writing and acting pretty much ruined it.~Cookson"
1,the worse,this movie is one of the worse movies I have ever seen and I have seen many. The writer director etc should hang their heads in shame...
2,Flawed Item,"Don't get me wrong the case turns heads, but the down fall is that where the bottom of the case slips off and the phone falls out. I had to put a small peice of double stick velcro and it really doesn't work to well. Great looking not fuctional they need to add support to the bottom of the case so it doesn't slip off."
2,"yummy beef, gross cheese","I had bought this before as a snack at the store and i love the combination of the beef and the white cheddar. I figure i would try to buy it bulk instead of paying $2 a pack at the store. However, I'm not sure if it was stored too long in the warehouse or if it was too hot in the warehouse, but the cheese was disgusting! it was dry and crumbly and had this awful taste. I even opened a second and third pack to see if it was a fluke, but all of the packages were like this. The beef stick was good, however, if i had to order again, i'd order the product without the cheese. It just was not fresh. (and yes, i did check the expiration date and it wasn't expired)"
4,Cute... but for the kids...,"As a decorative pillow, the bright color and 'cute' factor can't be beat. It's squishy and fun, but not very comfortable, mostly because of the rather cheap polyester shell.My 6 year old daughter sure loves it though, and she takes it everywhere around the house with her..."
3,"Comfy, but dangerous for kids and pets!!!","This pillow is comfortable, but buyer beware! With normal wear and tear, the pillow will eventually produce a hole and little tiny styrofoam beads will come out. Very dangerous for kids and pets!"
5,Great Product,"Very nicely constructed. Feels really soft and comfortable. Based on other customers' reviews of the tiny beads inside, I'm extremely weary of the covering every being torn and the beads pouring out. Otherwise, it's a 5-star product - great for gifts."
4,Entertaining and educational,"Well written and sharply focused. Presented in a manner that children can appreciate, but never try's to talk down to them. A valuable resource for any parent dealing with autism."
5,"Friendship, disappointment, and love","I have read this book 2 times! Both times, I enjoyed it!I love the friendship between Harmony and Aaron. It is sweet, innocent, and wonderful. Yet Harmony wants more! She wants Aaron to see her for more than a friend. When Aaron needs a roommate, in comes Drew! When Drew brings home Aaron's old girlfriend, Aaron and Harmony come up with ""A Plan"" to get Drew's attention off of Mandy. Will the plan fall apart and will Harmony lose the friendship with Aaron? Will Aaron realize how much he really loves Harmony before she gets too involved with Drew?Read and find out! Oh, and if you go through your co-workers desk looking for a staple remover, you may find something else!"
1,"Newer, improved version available","This book is out of print and hard to find (although I managed to get a copy through my local library). It teaches the basic techniques of making diffusion bonded mokume gane, including an excellent section on building your own kiln on the cheap. However, basically everything in it has been incorporated into a second, improved version called ""Mokume Gane - A Comprehensive Study"" (ISBN: 0965165078), which also contains a large number of color photographs. Don't spend time or money on ""Mokume Gane in the Small Shop"", go straight for ""Mokume Gane - A Comprehensive Study"" instead."
1,wrong season,Out of 5disc that's suppose to be season3 is season 2 what a disappointment and waste of money amazon has made huge mistake wander what episodes are on season 4
1,"Yucky, don't buy. but, very good customer service.","I never wrote bad review at amazon, but I have to tell you not to buy this item. They're not edible at all on the day it was delivered. I hate that I could not erase the only star in the rating.Though the beef jerky upset me, but the Amazon customer service did not. Though Amazon could not refund me for the purchased food items, it did give me a credit for my future purchase. Actually, the credit amount is the pre-discount price that is more than what I paid. I'm very happy. I believe the store credit will be used very soon."
4,This is a good fil,I met Matt Dillion in a small French bar at 3 am in Siem Ream back in '98. I guess he was considering doing this film and getting a feel for the country.The movie give a pretty good idea of what Cambodia is like back in the late 90's.If you want action this isn't the movie for you but I enjoyed it enough to watch it several times and to also go and buy a copy.
1,Help,"I am not reviewing the product, I'm reviewing Amazon. I ordered this item from Africa, to have a friend bring these life saving black ink cartridges to me. And suddenly I'm getting a cancellation after I ordered the cartridges 2 days ago. No explanation. Just, We are Sorry. Now I will have to have this friend go to the store to buy them, which is a pain to her and makes me feel guilty for living in an area that doesn't sell reliable ink cartridges (and they cost twice as much). It is the first time Amazon has done this to me. But, it terrifies me for the future, since I rely heavily on friends to bring precious items over for my work. What's with this Amazon."
5,good price and product,I have heard some problems with using after market printer cartridges so I have always gone with brand name. This HP cartridge has done its job well and at a great price. Shipping was very quick and transaction was smooth.
5,This single is so worth it,"For anyone who has been dying to hear the unreleased ""Ocean Song"" that Dave wrote back in 1997, here it is. And it is now called ""Closer"" and the song itself is worth buying the CD for. Many fans agree. ""Breathe"" is another B-side on this single and it is acoustic and mellow. You will want to kiss Dave's throat as he sings. And for every girl who tosses and turns, clutching their pillow when they hear Dave's raspy tones and ""ahhs"" and ""ohs"" (you know what I mean) - have fun swooning. The remixes of ""I Need You"" are not bad for the dance floor but the best remix is the first one. ""I Need You"" could be considered the most Depeche-sounding track from the album and sounds like it belongs on a DM album."
1,Are you kidding me?,"People are giving this book five stars? It looks like it was written in a week, because it WAS written in a week. There is nothing new, nothing insightful or redeeming about it. A big pass."
2,It's more like an essay than a book,"This book seems like it was written in a week. It will be interesting for fans of Rich, but really sheds no new light."
3,vivid introduction to forensic genotyping techniques,"Nice figures, photos, schemes, and U.S. tables; lively comparisons show that authors are good teachers. Though technical part of the book outdates fast necessarily (acronym SNP has not been coined in 1996 yet), it is a shame that an interpretation part of the book neglects the current knowledge. Bayes theorem is known since 1763 and, nevertheless, likelihood ratio is not even mentined in the book! Books of Evett and Weir or of Robertson and Vignaux cannot be substituted by this book."
3,"Ok sub, Box not big enough","sub is a good one, and worth the money without the box, or in a different type. Box is tuned for too high a frequency. I used it as a free-air sub instead, out of the box, and I am impressed. Wires inside are too small a guage and not connected well. Overall- not too bad."
5,This book is possibly the greatest record review in history,"If you have some of Mickey Newbury's work, you Have to get this book... If you don't know Mickey Newbury, but you have heard of him because of Townes or Guy Clark or any other of his many ""children"" out there, you Have to get this book... Whatever IT is, IT begins and ends with Mickey Newbury... IT has Always been about Mickey Newbury since the early Sixties when he first picked up a pen and stepped up to a microphone... Believe me, I am not overstating this or engaging in the hyperbole that is the fashion of the day, when I tell you that this book may be your one chance to cut through all the junk that passes for information these days and find out THE TRUTH about the music that you and I have both come to love and worship... The only music that counts, the music from the heart, not for the cash, but for the art; the music and words that we would write if WE were artists... If we were only artists like Joe Ziemer and Mickey Newbury..."
4,The best video document on the legendary group,"It's amazing how many releases of Hendrix material there has been and yet Cream has been largely ignored or treated shabbily. This video is the happy exception. The highlights are the ""rehearsal"" songs performed live with no audience. Although only one camera and substandard sound was used, it's still the best footage taken of the group. And it's worth the price of the disc alone. The emotional interviews with each member is icing on the cake. And the context setting for their music and roots is excellent. If you're an old baby boomer like me, it'll bring a tear to your eye. If you're a bit younger and want to see why they were indeed the Cream, this will do it!"
3,"Not bad, but nothing special","For me, this soup did not live up to its rave reviews here. I found it bland and not especially natural-tasting, just ""okay."" Of course, tastes differ, and if you think you might like it, check your grocery store first to try an individual pack. It sells for about $4/pack in my grocery store."
5,Get ready for a ride!,"Images from your past will dance in your head...your heart will race in anticipation for future memories...and you will not stop bouncing for the entirety of the song...Drowning will morph your perception of reality as you roll your way through the intricacies and vibes of this refreshing, ""on the bull's eye"" composition."
1,Avoid Veratex at all costs!,"I bought this set over a year ago and had the shams immediately fall apart. The comforter lost all of its fill within a year and the bed skirt loses fringe on a daily basis. I've even contacted the manufacturer, and now I know why quality is so low - the whole company is inept. They were rude, told me I had washed them (not so, I have no laundry related amnesia) and ultimately I complained to the BBB uselessly about them. Do yourself a favor and skip anything they make."
5,Great product - bad price!,"I just had a few bowls of this soup, it's great! However, I can purchase this soup for 3.18 per pack at WalMart or Target. That comes to 19.08 + tax (for six of them) with no shipping and instant gratification. Incidentally, it's 10.2 ounces per pack not 10.1!In consideration of fairness, there are others out there charging 20-28 bucks for the same 6 pack (including Walmart) - let the buyer beware! Eaches are sometimes cheaper than a bulk pack."
3,Not for the high way,The thing looks cool but it is a pain to put on and the plastic is flimsy and will not hold up to any kind of speed over 30mph; it needs more support.
4,The best help for 3dsmax newcomers,This is one of the best books I've ever seen. It's an all in one tutorial and you will learn functions that you never knew. Duane has written this book very well and simple. MUST BUY IT!!!!!
2,Shipping Problems,"Product took way to long to ship. The package was returned to them, but they made no attempt to reship it"
3,Instructional Value limited,We watched all three DVD's and in our opinion there is no instructional value or race footage. I can't see how this type of DVD is useful to skier's. There are much better videos out there for ski coaches.
4,If you're thinking about buying this product,"then you're probably a fan of Eureka seven. And if you're a fan, then you can't really go wrong in getting it. It's got all the music you can remember from the series, plus some tracks that you might not remember. The only slight problem I had was that some of the opening/closing songs were the short version. But it's still a great CD to buy and I definitely would recommend it."
4,before Soul 11 Soul&The Fugees,"there was Loose Ends who blended different styles&had many jams.""Slow Down"",""Hangin on a String"",etc...there voices worked well together&the arrangements were on point.Good Collection here."
3,"Nice overview, but Euro release is copy-protected...","A long overdue retrospective of this influential band is most welcome, and this collection manages to hit many career highlights, but this disc is copy-protected, so any attempts at copying discs and ripping MP3 files will be largely unsuccessful. Forewarned!!!"
4,Awesome movie,I love this movie! It's so funny and the story it's a bit weird but I really enjoyed it. Love the way the story is told by the characters. Maria Esteves is awesome in this movie.
5,Entertaining,I bought Pencil Play 2 for my 10 year old daughter after she said how much she liked the original Pencil Play. The variety of things to do keeps a late elementary/early middle schooler well entertained. It's very easy to put down and come back to and makes a nice interlude between homework and getting ready for bed. She also enjoyed having it on a road trip we went on.
1,Looks good,"This pole light is made of cheap materials. When I installed them, I had to just about completely rebuild them straight out of the box. They had glass popping out of the lights, screws that had stripped out, and were some of the hardest to get set straight. Good light if you dont mind doing alot of extra work."
4,Top of The Top 20,"10,000 name from around the world with the meaning and Ethnicity and national origin. This is a great book of names a little confusing but alot of cool names to look through."
5,Folk Socks (Folk Knitting Series),"This book is much more interesting that I thought it would be; it describes when and where socks were invented, and what people used before, as well as showing pictures of the oldest as the newest kind of socks. Furthermore there is lots of recipies for short, long, fine, modern, funny and much more socks :) , and examples of socks from all over the world. I warmly recommend this item.Elisabeth, Denmark, Scandinavia"
4,Metal Slug 2 rocks!,"If you liked the first one, you owe it to yourself to buy this. It is better than the first mission in every way. Graphics, sound, gameplay,and variety. There are 38 levels, some of which are very well hidden. This time, when you rescue a hostage, the NGPC remembers, and you can visit them after you complete a mission for secret information. Bazookas, rocket launchers and flamethrowers are just some of the new weapons to try. The Slug Sub and Jetpack are new too. This game is essential for your NGPC collection. I would say if you only had money for one game, this should be it!"
3,Fun for anyone.,"I was up in the air about getting this game on the Wii version after bad reviews. I decided to rent the games first and try it out before dishing out $30. I must say that it's not all that bad. I played a few games and won all but one. The hardest part was trying to figure out the moves to make on the controller. I would of likes to see an option where you can go, to familiarize yourself with the moves instead of just instruction. If you have the Bigs on the Wii system you know what I am talking about. The slam dunk contest is a but challenging since you have to be quick about your hand movement to ensure that 10 scoring dunk. The three point shoot out is great, which was easy for me to knock down the whole rack and win. There should of been more challenges to complete where you can unlock. Overall I am going to buy the actual game."
3,Good Product,The book is good. But I was expecting that it may contain a combination of key facts which will enhance my spiritual search and enlightment of the wonderful and miracle works of Jesus.
2,An Average Entry in an Average Series,"Kids in the 5-7 range will probably love this series with its dependable repetition of formulas that my kids loved to say out with me when we got to the best part of the book: ""The wind blew harder ... The treehouse started to spin ... faster and faster ... then everything was still. Absolutely still."" The loyalty and friendship which bond brother Jack and sister Annie are also a refreshing break from sibling squabbles.On the other hand, it's discouraging to watch the heroes of these books visit far-off times and places and learn virtually nothing about the places they go to, because the author is so ignorant about science, history and the English language (gravity varies depending on whether you're in a building or not; ""thou"" is a plural pronoun; etc.). If you want your kids to learn anything from their readings, you'll have to delve a little deeper into the mass of children's literature than this trivial series."
4,Pretty good book,One thing I like about Magic Tree House is that there is fun science. But it is easier to understand the storyline if you have read the previous books in the series. I think you should buy this book because it has some interesting facts about the Amazon. My favorite part of the book was that all the animals in rain forest fear the flesh-eating ants. The story is pretty good but I think I learned a lot more about the rain forest from the Magic School Bus book.
4,How to suuvival.,"This time, Jack and Annie travel to Amazon forest.There are a lot of dangerous creatures.Jack and Annie came to find items to save Morgan.They were almost eaten by piranha.At last, a monkey gave to them mango.Moonstone, Mango.These items were concerned with Morgan.This book teaches me about many creatures living in rainforest."
2,Space: the Dissapointing Frontier,"Space is a thick book, but it looked from the outside like a novel that would contain a good painting from the inside of the U.S. space program. For some reason the author created a new U.S. state called Fremont, (which constantly threw me off, being a CA bay area native), and once I got used to that, He went and CRASHED APOLLO 18! After that I lost 80% of my interest in the story. He rambled on for a long time, apparently he thinks that right-wing christians who disbelieve Darwin are therefore anti-science, and therefore it's their fault we cancelled the space program. I quit reading about 85% of the way through..."
3,Fair for Michener; read Tom Wolfe,"If you're interested in the space program, Michener does a fine job covering the history of the US space program from the fifties up to around the beginning of the shuttle program. But it is a Michener novel, so expect the usual melodrama. I highly recommend as an alternative Tom Wolfe's *book* ""The Right Stuff"" (the movie was okay, the book is much better) which is a more focused history of the early part of the US space program concentrating on the Mercury program and the original seven astronauts."
5,The perfect transcription of the perfect album!,"This is just what you want ... all the notes and all the words from all the songs, just as performed, nothing more and nothing less. Both tab and score. Buy that Martin guitar you've always wanted, tune it to the CD, and play along like you're Ron Block! Great fun!"
2,Not good for sensitive skin,"This lotion irritates my skin, making it red. The smell is not pleasant, either. I have been using it on my hands since it irritates my face and it feels a bit shiny/greasy to me, but says it is sheer. It earns 2 stars for having good skin healthy extracts in it; walnut seeds and olives. Save your $$, though."
4,Everything you'd expect...,"Wow. Thats all you can say when you hear Damaged. Pure, gaping jaw'd, WOW. This is quite possibly the most extreme music out there to date, and although their previous efforts (Token Remedies Research) seemed to be a bit more extreme and catchy, this cd still holds its own. The latest addition to the band is a new singer that focuses a little more on heavier, solid vocals, rather than just fast, indecipherable rants that seemed to be the dominating complaint about the first cd. The drumming is still the dominating powerhouse element that it was on the first cd, adding crazy, innovative rythyms to the slower, gut wrenching guitar riffs that became a trademark for Damaged in TRR. Purified in Pain will leave you extremely charged up and ready for action. Fast. Heavy. Extreme. Damaged."
3,I SAW THIS MOVIE ON TV,"AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A WELL DONE MOVIE. IT STARS ALLY SHEEHY AND WILLIAM MOSES AS A MARRIED COUPLE WHO FIND A TOTALLY AWESOME HOUSE AND BUY IT. WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT THERE IS A MYSTERIOUS WOMAN WHO COMES AND STAYS WITH THEM AND HAS A PREVIOUS CONNECTION TO THE HOUSE, AND IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD ONE EITHER.IT IS MORE ON THE LINES OF A THRILLER THAN AN ACTUAL HORROR FILM. STILL IT'S WELL DONE AND A GREAT CAST AND A GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH ON A RAINY DAY OR ON A NIGHT WITH THE LIGHTS OUT AND A VERY VERY BIG BOWL OF POPCORN."
2,poorly planned,"This book is hardly helpful. There's no pronunciation guide, which is very irritating. This book also lacks most of the sentences that you would use in every day speech."
3,Very solid album,"I bought this album mainly for one song: the Hybrid remix of ""Phuture 2000"". It was money well spent. Phuture 2000 has some good and not so good songs on it but overall it is a pretty good CD. Not the best that I've heard (except for the remix mentioned previously) but not the worst either."
3,good,this is a good movie. but could of been a little more specific on the movie all together. I still suggest people should what this movie it is still a good movie to watch
4,The fourth in the series but not the best!,"In this third sequel to Full Moon Pictures Subspecies series,Radu Vladilas returns once again to seek revenge on his beloved Michelle.After escaping Radu's foul castle lair,Michelle has last hope for salvation as the last of her humanity slips away.After being brought to a clinic(hospital)in Bucharest by a woman named Ana,Michelle is promised relief from her thrist for blood.Doctor Necluscu and Ana Liza must now protect Michelle from the most powerful vampire master of all time,Radu Vladilas.This is a really cool vampire film from the 90's but there is something missing.Oh,yes the great effects and music."
1,Disappointed,Book hasn't even arrived. Order was placed 5 weeks ago under fast international post. Still a no show. Disappointed. Puts me off ordering again.
1,Should be called the Smut's on Fire,"From looking at the author's website, you'd think his book is the great work of our time. Instead the writing is passable but amatuerish. The only reason you keep reading is out of a bizarre fascination due to all the vulgar and perverted sexual content. In the end its just a cheap, dirty soap opera. And it is immediately clear that the author has a massive ego. The worst disappointment was the ending, which was supposed to be inspirational. Instead you get vague references to metaphysical principles. And the ""mystery"" is not ever solved. The long and the short of it is that no respectable person would want anyone to know they own this book (its that vulgar-dozens of F-words and endless sexual encounters etc.) and the storyline is dull."
3,Not for beginners,"i enjoyed this book from an artist point of view, it is really great if you are more so into giving your work a more ""polished"" artistic look but not much for fashion illustration. Only the section about rendering fabric patterns (gingham,stripes, and fabric folds) are really useful."
3,Comp,Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
5,A tea that confuses me - in a good way,"Simply put, this tea is incredible. I would say I like tea, but I never really crave any tea...except this one. A cup of this in hand, sitting in a leather recliner and you'll find utter relaxation. The flavor is so rich and distinctive, after you've had just a couple cups over time, you can nearly taste it when thinking about it. What's confusing to me is that I'm not a fan of bitter flavors (not a coffee drinker), but I brew this dark and drink it straight and I love it (and it is a solid, black tea). I'm surprised at the price here...seems very inexpensive (usually I pay more in speciality import stores...seems I'm throwing money away)."
1,Major Disappointment,"The title would indicate that one might get closer to truth by reading the book. Well, too many cooks spoil the broth. All the good that can be taken from this book must be sifted from all the bad and all the neutral and all the filler that I really could have done without. All and all it is a philosophical book. Had I known this I would have never bought it. Robert Kuhn is an excellent writer and a foremost expert on the human brain. Had I known he was going to sub-contract his thought patterns to the pack of academics, I would certainly have passed up this book."
2,Caution: colors are not as they appear!,"I just received these shoes in Olive. While they are extremely comfortable shoes, I was not pleased with the color. On the website, the Olive color looks almost brownish. But the actual shoe is a very bold, bright olive green. I wish this shoe came in a better color!"
2,big whale - small fish,I recently order two copies of this book from two different vendors. I thought I was purchasing the original book that was an 8 x 10 or a 10 x 12 inch size book- On both occasions I received the small baby size hard book instead. I guess I should have been more clear or the description should be more clear. Be careful if you order this book- you may not get what you thought you would get. A large original book- pre-baby sized. Lesson is...ask first. My bad.
5,G*d Save the DP's,"Got this album when it first came out, then let someone borrow it and never saw it again. I just recently picked it up again. After listening to the whole thing through, I realized that this has to be the most nuanced hip-hop album ever made. It's almost depressing to listen to because this album makes you realize just how incredibly horrible hip-hop has become since. Of course, there's the ever-present but useless debate about which DP album is better but it just doesn't matter anymore. The DP's are artists in every sense and each track on this album is lovingly crafted and the whole thing just resonates with fierce creativity and a sensitivity not found anymore in this once groundbreaking genre that isn't so groundbreaking anymore."
5,Just the Right Get-Up and Go,"First, I was very impressed with the delivery time.I use this product as a boost for my a.m. workout. It gives just enough caffeine to get me going."
2,Stimulation that caused me to reconsider,"This product immediately made my metabolism speed up.I felt nervous and edgy.I found gthat it curbed my appetite and when paired with coffee(which I drink daily twice). The hyper feeling that took over me,pursuaded me to stop .I tried it for one week,and my appetite did decrease. I have always been sensitive to stimulants,and so I elected to not continue as I don't trust big changes in energy levels.I also had trouble winding down to sleep.For others this might be fine,but my instincts told me to stop taking this metabolic accelerator.My abs are not that important to me i guess."
2,No Weight Lost,"After taking all 40 pills over a 20 day period I can only report no effect detected, no measurable weight loss during this time period.Perhaps a longer test is required to see some real results, but at 82 cents a day (or 70 cents a day if you use Amazon's Subscribe & Save) I do not intend to fund such an experiment myself."
3,Worked much better for me than Hydroxycut,"I approached this product with a certain amount of skepticism. I have tried using Hydroxycut in the past, and found that my system didn't react well to it. Besides making me somewhat nauseous, Hydroxycut also caused me to be excessibly jittery, and I had to stop using it. Fortunately, I did not have such a reaction with Ripped Fuel, which may be because of the reduced dosage. The label instructs you to take one tablet twice a day before a meal, which is a good deal less than the instructions for Hydroxycut.I'm pleased to report that I did experience good results from using Ripped Fuel, and would probably use it again. I'm finally beginning to see my abs for the first time, and it does seem to help curb appetite, to an extent. (Of course, I'm also in the gym five and six days a week, so this is certainly just a supplement to, and not a replacement for, exercise. Don't expect to see results from this product if you're not willing to do your part as well.)"
4,Incredible book to live by.,This book is a book for anyone who is interested in developing sound interpersonal relationships. This is a read not once but a read ongoing throughout life. The examples and advice in a biblical sense yet not overly religious in any way.
2,Cheap Cover,"I purchased this as an inexpensive way to protect my ipod. The cover began to 'pill' almost immediately. Manufacturer must have used cheap material because the color began to rub off onto the click wheel of the iPod. The dye does not come off so now I have a 'pink click wheel'. The ipod slips out of the cover all the time since the cover is fully open at the top, there is no velcro or drawstring fastener.On reflection, I think I would have been better served if I used a white sock out of my sock drawer. The purchase was a big mistake and it is now in the trash."
1,Another mediocre album!,"I have been a fan of hers from the beginning (1972) and always bought her albums on the release date. The last three albums have been a major disappointment! I am no longer going to buy on blind trust. If Bette's new TV series is as bad as this album AND her last two movies-she's in BIG TROUBLE career-wise! This album is as mediocre as her awful ""Bette of Roses"". The choice of material sucks. ""HIT"" isn't written on any of the songs on the album. Her voice is flat and it cracks when she tries to hit notes she is no longer capable of hitting. the assistance from her 'Harlettes' on these notes is SO noticeable as to totally obscure her voice from the recording! Save your money and buy this in the discount bins it will be there soon enough."
3,this sounds like a soundtrack for her new sitcom,i like this album and i like the cover renditions of classics. I got the feel from this cd that there is a dual purpose here. The feeling that this project was done more to provide musical material to work with the new sitcom than to strive for a higher inspiration. Non the less this title will be getting regular play from me.....
2,Elevator Music,"I hope this CD isn't a sign of things to come. ""Bathhouse Bette"" was terrific. Energetic, imaginative. A variety of material and musical styles. This is a CD you listen to lull you to sleep. ""In these shoes"" is the only fun song. I love many of Bette's ballads, but none on this album strike me as memorable. Please bring back the campy, brash, energetic Bette. The most talented entertainer on earth."
5,Excellent products - by AMES* - Always high Quality - will outlast,"Us for sure- in 70's - Had had these years ago for trimming vines away from fencingHere in South called 'Virginia Creeper' - nice privacy vine - pretty leaf BUT needs 'controlling' along chain-link fence lines - Also trims/controls Honeysuckle Hedge neatly -These also work very well for trimming/shaping soft shrubs as Arbor Vitae -Ames True Temper Pruning Solutions Steel Handle Hedge Shear #2346030using in tandem with these AMES* pruners [Roses, etc]Ames True Temper 2353200 Bypass Pruner with 3/4-Inch Cutting CapacityIn fact All AMES* products are ergonomic friendly w/added comfort grips/handle designs for athritic hands/wrists.Add to that Amazon's great pricing/sales etc - then sit back - enjoy the 'fruit of Ur labor' and more so the cost savings!"
3,For Mallards Only,"The book is inexpensive and provides basic images of several duck species. However, it provides painting instructions only for mallards. For example, the book lists the primary paint colors for the other species, but it doesn't offer any information as to which of these colors are to be mixed to obtain the colors depicted in the images. This was a problem when I needed to repaint by Woodie dekes."
4,The Way as a Metaphor,"A metaphor of the Camino: stumbling, aching in the beginning then ambling along in the right direction to a superb, uplifting ending. It's as if the movie was directed by two individuals, a novice and a master.The first hour contained massive, over-blown portrayals of the four major characters. The introductory dialogues were lengthly with mega doses of dramatic excess. Then after Burgos, in the second hour, a well-executed melodrama surged from s skillfully written screenplay. The actors convincingly reflected pilgrims on their peripatetic journey of renewal. The best and most moving scenes were when few words were spoken: the parador in Leon, placing stones at Cruz de Ferro, the arrival at the cathedral , and standing at the sea at the end of their journey.Anyone who has walked the Camino from St Jean to Santiago could easily identify with the four pilgrims in the latter stages of their pilgrimage."
3,Ok but not great,"A group of grumpy people trying to find their way, nothing outstanding about it. I expected more of it but nothing out of the ordinary."
5,The Way ~ you have to experience it as well for yourself,This movie was well done and depicted some very important portions of the Camino Walk. I had just returned from that area of Spain as a guest of the Spain Board of Tourism because I am a Travel Agency Owner. Those of us that were on this Gastronomy and Wine Tour were introduced to this area from the Travel Agent point of view. It was an amazing experience and I was very moved by the movie. I have been in some of those hostels and they are just what the movie depicted. Well done! I will recommend it to all my clients that are thinking about traveling to Spain as it is something not to be missed.
4,Great movie.,I'm a big Martin Sheen fan and this movie did not disappoint. Read some of the reviews other people have written. They've done a better job than I could do but I just wanted to put my two cents worth out three to say how much I enjoyed the movie.
5,reviews,need more movies like this..emillio did a great job..and of coarse martin helped his son make it a special movie..
4,A Pleasant Change,"This is not a movie about car chases, spectacular crashes, impossible acrobatics and millions of bullet holes. It is, rather, a quiet movie about several people each with their own unique problems and personalities, all trying to find their ""way"" to knowing what life is all about. The answer is different for each."
4,Why we walk The Camino,"Having hiked 'The Camino', the movie does portray the essence of life on the trail; every 'Pilgrim' has a story and a reason to be there, and everyone takes something a way from the experience they didn't expect."
5,The Way,"A very touching story, and well worth watching. The book is good too, although I have not read the book. The movie is excellent...bought one for a friend!"
5,Must See,"My wife and I walked the Camino in the Spring of 2011. It was a great experience and this movie captures much of that spirit. Sure, some aspects of fictionalized but it does a great job of showing the experience, the hardships and joy of the Camino. It is like life...some good, some bad but the journey is the important part."
4,From PITA to Loveable Old Guy,"Emilio did a great job in directing his father, Martin Sheen, in this nicely told story of a small group of peregrinos on the Camino de Compastelo.Martin is at his best and does a nice job of making you dislike his character and then falling in step with him near the end.The scenery is fantastic and beautifully captured.We have viewed the film 3 times and have enjoyed it more each time. We would recommend THE WAY to all audiences."
4,Poor streaming of film ruined it for me.,I enjoyed this film but would have enjoyed it more If the picture hadn't stopped every 3 minutes or so due to streaming difficulties. Very hard to maintain interest in a presentation like that.
5,The Way,"A friend who actually walked the Camino told me about this film. So when I saw the DVDThe Wayavailable on Amazon I immediately purchased it. I have to tell you, vicariously experiencing the Camino through the film was certainly much easier than my friend's real experience, say 2 hours instead of 40 days!! She suggested that we should watch it again with the director's comments. That will be next."
4,Very Good,"Very good movie. I had never heard of ""El Camino de Santiago"". It reiterates the love of a father and son, as well as the deep down goodness of total strangers. A movie that I enjoyed immensely. Very thought provoking and funny. A movie all will enjoy."
4,Walking the Camino,"While I don't recall a mention of blisters, bed bugs or weather, which are hot topics of conversation along The Way, this was a movie I enjoyed. It showed some of the lovely areas--and avoided those where you walk next to a highway.It's not as easy as they made it look, but I've always appreciated Martin Sheen's acting and wasn't disappointed. The ending is classic and so rewarding!For those of you who are now going to walk it, check out some of the Camino Web sites for advice and encouragement. Buen Camino!"
5,Must See Movie,I highly recommend this movie - I rented it initially and decided it must be in my home collection. A wonderful family collaboration.
5,"There is only one way, ""The Way""!","We watched this movie with 6 close friends. Very engaging. Some tears. Some laughter. Great photography. I have multiple scelerosis, but still felt compelled to take the Pilgrimage after viewing. This movie caused all viewing to take a self inventory. Quite a moving expierence."
5,A movie you can both agree on,"This is one of those movies I could watch repeatedly. It's a journey movie, one where the characters discover what's important along the way, and how the main character ends up on the trail is actually rather sad. However, the scenery is breathtaking, the drama feels real, and it was a movie that my significant other and I both agreed was fantastic. Since we don't find many of those, it's definitely one that I'll be adding to our collection."
5,A little jewel,"I was a little skeptical about the value of this warmer, but it really does a great job and is able to keep tortillas warm. The tortillas that are heated in the microwave inside the warmer are soft, and not the least bit tough or chewey. The warmer is easy to use, easy to clean, and is attractive."
5,Terrific!,This really works very well. I had purchased one previously at another store and loved it! I bought several and sent to many people in my family. I recommend it highly.
2,No a good product - uneven response on a smooth surface,"I use a synco carrom and I am using (trying to use) this striker for past 8+ months.Looks - This is a very heavy striker looks and feels bulky but good.Works - It stops (abruptly brakes) in between. Initially, I thought this is with my carrom board issue, however when I used other striker from Synco it works better and smooth.I am not able to figure whats exactly wrong with this striker but as of now its useless for me."
5,"Great Report, Egomaniacal Author","This report is a must-read for multiprocessor enthusiasts. Yes, anyone with a multiprocessor or anyone that's seen one will recognize the genius of the authors. That's right. There's more than one author. Not that the self-promoting reviewer would ever ackowledge that fact. I'm proud of my multiprocessor. He hides in the bathroom with his."
5,Heavy user - and a year later it continues to work great!,Used my sony camcorder every day and love having the extra battery life this unit gives me. 1 year later and with a full charge it still reads over 700 minutes every time.Would buy again and have recommended this product to family and friends.
4,Very Satisfied,"I am very pleased with this Battery. It seems to last about 7 hours, and also shows up in the hours and minutes left screen in my camcorder, something that most generic batteries won't do. The Battery is a little large when trying to view through the eye piece, but not enough to prevent that function."
5,I hope is will be a excellent product.,I bought the Sony battery for my daughter in law as a gift. I don't know she ready use it or not. And also I just received a battery charger order from your guy. I know is will be a excellent stuff.
1,Not so good!,After few months the mp3 player is not working well! :-(Some problems with headphones and the sound.
2,What planted the seed which brought forth root?,"The social sciences sufficiently got rid of the human dimension long ago so that discussions on the human resemble something wholly different. Philosophy, these days, often wants to fine-tune what is popular (in the sciences) and that is what this book does. Rather than reinvigorate a field in need of much oxygen this book mostly reconsiders issues in a politically correct pragmatism. It's highlight is that it is easy to understand; doesn't seek to shroud in mystery the hinges that move the thinking that it is based upon."
4,I have liked most of books,For some reason this story had an extra element that the author put in the plot line that seemed to make it different than some of her other cavanaugh justice books.
4,"Quincy, Sammy and the Count...perfect together!!","It was a thrill to hear Quincy and a smoking big band for the first time in far too many years...and with Sammy on the premises, this was a great concept, paying collective tribute to the great Count Basie (for whom both once arranged).I can smell another Grammy for Q next year!!!"
4,"Very cool since I listen 2 ""Q's Jook Joint""","I actually heard 'bout this album he did back in '99 or '00 since I heard it on a interview he did on Bravo! Entertainment. I think it means he returning back to his jazz roots since he worked with so many greats like Ray Charles, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Patti Austin, Frank Sinatra, etc.I don't think it ain't that much of a disappointment knahmmean. I think is much more mature since the last album he put out which was great in '95-'96 classic Q'S JOOK JOINT.I think it's a must-have for those who are real fans to Basie, Ellington, Sinatra, Miles, Dizzy, Bird, Goodman, Woody Herman, and/or real big fans to the jazz/big band greats of Harry Connick Jr., Brian Setzer, Maynard Ferguson and Big Bop Nouveau, etc. I think my man Q would deserve a high A+ 4 this one knahmsayin."
4,Suzanne,This book had me hooked in two pages - the lovely Linda and her crazy belief in superstitions! I continued to be drawn into the story and was amazed that the author could so well convey the emotions and feelings that made these characters come alive for me. Kevin Cropp is a wonderful story teller and I look forward to reading his future work and watching him develop as a writer.
5,I read it in one sitting!,"The Time Keeper caught me, kept me and would not let go. I cried harder than I have in years. I myself, not feeling at peace with my relationship with my own mother (she passed away also) this book really hit me hard and yet gave me hope in life. What a wonder! I await other writings by Kevin Cropp with eager anticipation and will not be ""loaning"" out my autographed copy of this wonderful work of art."
3,delicious,"a little much to pay for just a can of frosting and shipping and handling, but i certainly enjoyed and made use of it"
1,Don't waste your money,"I have a set of coins and a striker for my carrom board but we wanted a heavy sturdy striker. This striker is small, light and sits poorly on the board. I can't believe I wasted 12 bucks (10 plus 2 on the shipping) for this product."
5,Wonderful,This casette is wonderful. My daughter is a baby but listens to it every night! Highly recommend.
4,A bittersweet reflection of color-crossed love.,"At last, a romance that depicts reality rather than fantasy. A disturbing story echoing disturbing times."
4,okay,it was good but i thought it was kind of lame that the boys were mad that james got kicked out of school. i read it in one night. i couldn't put it down
2,I wouldn&#65533;t agree,"I wouldn't say I'd be feeling so good. Great beat, but Jennifer comes in and she screws the whole damned thing up. She should have never been nominated for a single music award. Should just stick to the big screen. Just my luck."
5,Buy this book!,"fantastic book, well researched and a great gift for anyone with an interest in the great drummers of these genres of music!"
3,"Good, but not too durable","This is a very utility bag, which can hold many things. I put six of my mouthpiece in the front pouch, the cleaning kit, some reeds, and there r plenty of rooms.Aesthetic-wise, I also got a lot of praises when carrying the bag. The experience was perfect until about three months later the seam on the shoulder strap came loose, as the result I had to go to a tailor store to re-seam the strap. If I had not paid attention to the loose strap, Imagine I could have dropped my saxophone while carrying, and damage it. I wonder if anyone else had similar experience?"
1,Too Small To Be Useful. Too Big to Return,"I had forgotten that I have a strict policy against buying anything online or through the mail that can't be returned easily.I got two of these to store extra books, DVDs etc. I'm still trying to find something that will fit on it. It's got the capacity of a spice rack.The shelves are too narrow and too shallow for paperbacks,VHS tapes or oversized DVD cases. It's also flimsy; looks like it would tip over very easily.Worst of all: it can't be returned. The cost to ship it back is almost as much as the cost of the unit itself.Maybe I'll start collecting the little liquor bottles they serve on planes. I think they might fit."
5,"faseli, the mech fighting game.","Faseli is an awesome game. at first, you have to get used to programming your next five moves, but after that, it's THE COOLEST GAME. you command a TS (a mech) and you can get new weapons computer chips, and a cpu to hold the chips. you can buy better TS's that can hold more weapons and items. in battle you can do five moves per turn. the moves are left, right, forward, backward, weapons, items, or reload. a MUST HAVE for anyone with a ngpc."
4,DON'T OVERPAY FOR THIS,"This is a fantastic album. However, there are other means and ways to obtain digital copies of this album and I would suggest going that route as I found them with a little digging. Don't pay the ridiculous prices listed here."
5,Superb Book,"This is a deeply researched and beautifully written book - an essential volume on an immensely important subject. Recent news events prompted my rereading. Since the original copy was on loan, I purchased and recommend the handsome paperback edition. Do not delay buying and reading this compelling book!"
5,muddy waters,I bought this album for my husband who loves the blues. He couldn't have been happier with it. He listened to it all night with his eyes closed and a smile on his face. Awesome.
3,but what are they saying?,"This is, musically, a wonderful set. But beware: there are no song text translations; a fatal oversight for six CDs of almost exclusively vocal music by composers to whom text was as important as melody, and in languages that don't exist anymore. In that regard, it was very disappointing."
3,Omission of Thomas Paine,"It is an interesting comment on accuracy to consider that in Ridpath's text , there is not a mention of the role played by Thomas Paine , Common Sense , or the Crisis , in the American Revolution ."
3,"Very insightful, but very one-sided","This book has great insight into some of our motivations, but it is very one-sided towards the wisdom of older people, and the stupidity of the younger ones driven completely by nature. It's quintessential Barbara, advocating responsibility and structure ahead of dreams. Romantics will be crushed."
5,WOW This book is a life changer!,"Have you got to 40 and thought your life was over? Well think again. It's Only Too Late If You Don't Start Now is here to show you that not only is your life *not* over at 40 - it's only just beginning!In this life changing text Barbara Sher teaches us how to ignore social convention, turn our backs on cultural indoctrination and really start living. Did you know that the 'first half' of your life was only a period where you made your mistakes. It certainly wasn't the be all and end all. Bringing into focus once again your dreams, wishes and ambitions, here Ms Sher shows us how we have not yet even started to really live.After reading this book to the end page, I flipped back to the first page and started reading again, it's so profound and a 'different' person finished reading the book than the one who started reading it! I turned 40 this year and this book has changed my life - will it change yours?"
2,"Well written, but very depressing","This book is very well written and has some interesting concepts, but I got so depressed by the negative descriptions of getting older that I stopped reading after about two-thirds.When I bought this book I thought it would be encouraging people to plan a great life and career after 40, but I didn't see anything about a career nor about a good life. It was all about getting used to the idea that it's over and you have to get used to the idea.I also wouldn't recommend this book to a woman who has a husband because he sure wouldn't agree with a lot of the things the author has to say about beauty and love past 40."
4,Nordic Naturals Great Product,"I am about to order this product for the third time...I love it. I dont get a fishy aftertaste or burps. I also give one a day to my son who has ADHD and it has helped him with his hyperness once his regular meds wear off in the afternoon.The only downside is when I first ordered the product I only had to take one pill to get the full dosage, now for some reason they changed it to two pills a day? Other than that I am very satisfied."
5,review of clip art dvd,this is a good source of clip art if you are going to use the image on line or in photo shop. you won't have to scan it. great designs for church banners or anything church related.
3,Bad Girls of the Bible,The book Bad Girls of the Bible is great but the Video does not go with each chapter of the workbook. I am leading a bible study and was hoping that the dvd was done with each chapter. The DVD is good but just a very short story of the book. The DVD is 60 minutes long and it is funny but really doesn't benefit the book and workbook at the same time.
4,"Compare this to ""Instrument of the Devil""...","Right up front I have to say that I have great respect for Gil Shaham's renditions of more serious works and I also think this album is just plain fun. However, for a thematically identical recording, Rachel Barton's ""Instrument of the Devil"" beats it, hands down. First of all, the non-coincident selections are more consistent with the theme. Secondly, Rachel just plays better. An obvious example is on Bazzini's ""Dance of the Goblins,"" neither violinist plays it perfectly, but she plays it with a real flair and he seems to be struggling to keep up. Overall, Barton and her partner(s) play with more energy, more gusto than Shaham and his pianist."
4,Pretty good,"This CD has pretty interesting selection. My only qualm about it is sometimes it seems that the piano is competing for volume with the soloist, especially in Dans Macabre. This rendition is definitely not my favourite version. But some other gems make up for this, like Devils Dance, and La Ronde des Lutins. Devils dance is really well arranged and performed, and thats my favourite track on this album."
3,"Interesting, exciting but factual???",As others have mentioned there seems to be much conjecture and poor or no references to back claimed facts. Could we have some comments from learned scolars in this area- perhaps relevant qualifications/position could be given with reviews- Alan Heath an interested but non-qualified reader.
5,"5 stars for entertainment, 1 star for scholarship","I was led to read The Hiram Key from the Picknett and Prince book The Templar Revelation. After reading the meticulously footnooted book by Picknett and Prince, I am really disappointed by the lack of scholarship demonstrated by The Hiram Key. I am certainly not a domain expert in the Egyptology, New Testament, Gnosticism, Early Christianity, nor Hermeticism, but I can tell when someone is blowing smoke and the lack of documentation for Knight and Lomas' hypotheses makes me very suspicious of their conclusions.On the other hand, the book is a fun read, like supermarket tabloids. The pacing is good and the conclusions they come to make you think. I agree with another reviewer that the value of the book may be as a springboard for some more serious academic research."
2,"Interesting read, whether fact and/or fiction","This is a good book to stimulate one's introspection and speculation. Even if one does not hold a Ph.D nor is a dedicated student of Christianity or Freemasonry, there is much controversial literature available, some of it having been discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi Library and Agnostic library, to cause one to question the authenticity of much of the Old and New Testament of the Christian Bible. Unless one is extremely serious about whether the info in this book is actually factual, it is a good book for causing one to research further many of the statements made herein. I found the book interesting, although at times challenging by their findings."
4,"Nice Work, BUT...","One of the best reads I've had in a long time. The authors do an outstanding job linking different items. But many of their conclusions are just that. The majority of the path they lead makes sense, but the references are few and far between. Aside from a few footnoted book titles, the reader is left without a place to back up the authors' otherwise very plausible deductions. Overall, a MUST for any true theologian or Mason.WARNING: Devout Catholics, Hardcore Christians, and Orthodox Jews without an open mind will be offended.Also non-Masons may not see a few of the connections the authors make."
1,Pseudo-Science at its Best,This is one of the poorest books I've ever read. The science is so poor it is laughable. Truly a waste of your money. The education system has definitely failed us in this case.
4,Fascinating!,"The Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasonry, and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of JesusIf you enjoy books that challenge convention, this one fits the bill. Through their research on the roots of modern Freemasonry, the authors present a highly entertaining and thought-provoking look at the history, hijacking and politicization/corruption of religion as a powerful means of control. Quite a lid-blower!"
2,Conjecture posing as history,"The authors present heavily biased conjecture as a rigorous analysis of historical esoterica and, not surprisingly, arrive at their own foregone conclusions regarding the origins of Freemasonry.The work is very poorly documented. Assertions of historical fact are based on the flimsiest of evidence. Alternative interpretations of the ""facts"" are either not presented at all or are simply dismissed out-of-hand.As a useful work of history, ""The Hiram Key"" ranks right down there with Van Daniken's ""Chariots of the Gods""."
2,Just don't believe it all.,"This book makes an interesting read, but I my jaw dropped when the authors dragged the Shroud of Turin into it. Also, the book is quite Anti-Catholic. There are bits and pieces of interesting research here, but they are put together with innuendos, half-truths and very broad suppositions to make a confusing picture which I consider false."
3,"Interesting, but highly speculative.",As an active freemason I found the book very interesting. However the authors take very small amounts of evidence and form far reaching speculations. Though highly interesting the book falls far short of being a scholarly historical work.
2,"Some interesting bits, but....","The book has some bright spots, especially some information about the Freemasons that is not readily found elsewhere. But, overall the book is not very well written - there are many leaps of logic, which may have been quite clear to the authors, but are not clear to the reader. Certainly there other books of this type that are much better - viz, ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" or most of the books by Graham Hancock."
4,Let there be light...,"This book draws many conclusions, some far fetched and some brutally honest. It is a must read for anyone interested in history or freemasonry. The main thing that stuck with me during and after reading this book and the sequal (The Second Messiah), is how today's ""Christians"" so blindly follow what they are told. How time, political pressures, and money have changed the teachings of a great man/prophet/messiah (your choice). Anyone that is such a fervant believer should do their own investiating, not just sit back and listen to what you are told. You can go to China or Cuba for that."
4,A must have for Zappa fans,"Been a Zappa fan since the first Mothers of Invention but, I agree, you either love him or you don't like him. If you love him you must have this DVD. If you don't like him, pass this by and get something you like, this will just be more slime from the video"
1,Nanook oh nono,Really looking forward to the band playing these 2 classic albums live.But nooooooooooooIt's just another doc dressed to misinform and make a buck off Frank.I'd like to use the lead filled snowshoe on the producers.
2,I'm disappointed.,Hand straps are too short to be able to carry it easily. Have to remove the shoulder strap to get to the trombone after the case is opened. Zipper is coming loose after only one month of use. Interior does not hold the bell portion of my King 3B with f-attachment securely. All in all I wish I had returned it when I had the chance but didn't start using it until two months after it arrived.
5,Virtual Pool 3,"I had a LOT of trouble getting the game to load and run, but after I ran the diagnostics for the dx version that came with the game, everything ran fine (even though the diagnostics all came up fine [no problem detected] - dx must have been sleeping). RocknJoe Computers (the seller) was great in helping me work out the bugs - offered advice, provided support web site info, offered a refund if we couldn't figure it out, etc. RocknJoe was great!! The program works and looks great, even though the tracking angle displays aren't accurate with english on the cue ball."
5,Absolutely amazing program!,My sons had learned a little bit of spanish from Dora the explorer on TV< but aside from that had never been exposed to other languages. However with in 5 minutes of watching the Dutch session they were both running around saying different words in dutch! They seemed to have an extremely good understanding of what they were saying as well! I am SO thrilled about Dino Lingo!! We will definitely be using Dino Lingo Programs in general to help advance our children's speech and language abilities!
2,No carving,The button you receive is not carved.The item is somewhat misrepresented as the picture shows a carved animal and the seller does not say the button you receive is not carved. It is just a button.
4,A solid rendition,"After just having performed the show at my high school, I have had the pleasure of listening to this CD for the last two months, and I have yet to tire of it. The songs are all solidly performed, with some truly stand-out performers. The actress who sings ""Becky""'s role, however, has a voice that grates on the nerves at times, especially in the earlier songs. All in all, however, this is a good recording of a GREAT show!"
3,Not exactly what we wanted,"Unfortunately this video is not what I thought it would be. My expectation was that it would be more like an exercise video. However, the kids don't move from one pose to another. There is time in between where there are no poses going on and we sit and wait for the next pose to begin. My daughter is 22 months. She enjoys the Mom and Toddler Fitness DVD from Parents much more than this video. We like this video, but it is not exactly what we were looking for."
4,"Very, very good for novices and the expereinced","the writing style is a bit stilted and strained at times, but the content is worth the worse than average writing style. Both the novice and the experienced will benefit from this book - it has a little bit for everyone. Especially enjoyed the ""couples"" aspect of it."
4,"This time, Ice age.","This time, Jack and Annie traveled in the ice age.They have to find out an item to help Morgan.In the ice age, it is too cold for them.But they found out clothes made of fur.This story can teach to me about words concerned with ice age."
2,Pirated,"I'm fairly certain the dvd I purchased is a pirated copy. It doesn't seem right compared to the other seasons. It plays fine, though."
5,Wickedly funny TV show and delivered on time,"No doubt one of the best situation comedies EVER on US television. Our family loves to watch these episodes over and over. We couldn't wait to receive this DVD, which arrived on the day it was released. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,Great Present to make someone laugh,"I ordered so many copies of various seasons of Modern Family as Christmas presents for family and friends. Everyone can relate, it's a great and hilarious show. Highly recommended. VERY fast shipping."
5,Hilarious,"This show is hilariously funny. We couldn't stop watching. We missed the first two seasons and caught up by buying the DVDs. Our kids suggested the show to us. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at a sitcom. The family is just dysfunctional enough to funny, but not so much as to be condescending and they, in a comical way, broach a lot of controversial subjects. We're going to watch them all again and we hardly ever watch reruns of TV shows until about 10 years time has gone by."
5,Very good deal and with a FREE fine point marker,Good price on a good marker. It came with a free pointed tip marker. I always have Amazon Prime because I buy a lot yearly so it came out to $1 each and no tax for a few more months in California. That's the bad news for Californians. The state is going to start STEALING a whopping 10% on everything I buy soon. I'm working on how I can steal from them.
1,Dissapointed,I bought this cable for travel with my external HD and iPod. I was unable to mount either the iPod or the HD on my Mac even thought they worked with other cables I own.
5,Brilliant album,A brilliant album of songs from the era and a must have item for any one seriously interested in folk / rock. This band started it all
2,always a reason,"When am I going to learn. There are always reasons something has been off the shelf for so long. The long unavailable. The ""rarest"" of releases. Please. Please. Oh the guitar playing is fine. It has a mood. But the singing is arch, embarrassingly didactic, stiff, etc etc Your pick the word you would use todescribe that bad poem you wrote a significant other in high school or college. This has been buried for the same reason most of its ilk has been buried...bad songwriting. Boring, boring, boring."
2,Poorly organized and somewhat rambling,"This book is for intermediate players, so my review is for intermediate players.Better defenders identify declarer's concerns and intentions, resulting in a line of defense to realize the concerns and frustrate the intentions. The card play and signals support that line of thinking.This book is backwards as it focuses on card play and signals with the thought process all over the place depending on the subject at hand.The clarity of writing itself is only OK, and I have no issue with the content.I just had trouble trying to apply the disorganized specifics to my actual game."
1,Not good,This mat claims that it adheres to the floor but my little kitten could move it all over the floor. It did collect litter but trying to vacuum it off just kept moving the mat around. I ended up throwing it out.
4,Straight foreward information about cooking,"French Cooking in Ten Minutes: Or Adapting to the Rhythm of Modern Life by Edouard De Pimiane will give cooks basic information about preparing a meal in a short amount of time.Written in 1930, the quick and easy recipes can be just the thing for a change of pace in the kitchen.Translated from the French, this little cookbook gives us a view of life 58 years ago when things moved at a fast pace and people had little time for cooking after a long day at the office. Sounds like today!De Pomiane's recipes utilize pre-packaged and canned foods, fresh fruit, and step by step instructions. De Pomiane, a doctor by profession, makes even the trickest of sauces appear easy to make. All in all, not a bad addition to the kitchen bookshelf."
4,'Cause the dice roll...so indifferently,"This compilation appears to run in chronological order, and if so, it shows us how much better the band got with time. The first four tracks are a bit strident for all but dyed-in-the-wool fans. Haven't heard many of these tracks in several years, and I had forgotten how good some of them are. The landmark ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" needs no introduction, and was even mentioned in a ""Simpsons"" episode. In my own time, this song was the subject of considerable controversy because it had a reputation for ""encouraging teen suicide"". Underappreciated treasures on this CD include ""In Thee"", which transcends its humble Pop and Country origins, and ""Burning for You"", which takes a page from both Faust and Kerouac!Though you may be past the point of buying this CD just to scare your parents...get it now because time has turned it into the voice of your generation."
5,an awesome collection from new york's greatest band,"dont fear the reaper is a superb single disc compilation from the greatest rock band to come out of long island ny.this is rock music at it's finest.all their big hits like CITIES ON FLAME WITH ROCK AND ROLL,RED AND THE BLACK,FLAMING TELEPATHS,DONT FEAR THE REAPER and the ballads I LOVE THE NIGHT and BURNIN FOR YOU are present in this compilation which is good value for money.for a better overview of this great band I suggest you to get WORKSHOP OF THE TELESCOPES a double disc box set.very highly recommended"
4,Cool,"This was my first BOC cd, and I think it's pretty good. It was a good intro for me, but other people said that it's not really a good BOC album. Oh well, I guess this is an introductory cd for people who want to hear BOC. Also, isn't that one of the coolest covers you've ever seen?"
3,"Good, but...","The music is good, but the songs listed on the case aren't in the same order as the songs on the CD. Plus the number of songs on the CD are not the same as the number on the case. I called Putumayo, but they had no response."
2,SLOW DOWN,"I've been playing for like 5 years now, 20 previous to that on Bass. This dude doesn't play ONE Exercise at NORMAL tempo until like exercise 12 or so.The CD is almost worthless because of his heavy distortion, even delay !!!Finally he plays something ""Slow"" and I can make it out.. I read music but even his ""progressions' don't sound like what you hear on the CD.. #2 specifically..Slow blues #1 I heard but again its friggin fast ! I can get it but its not what you'd expect. Even his exercises, he holds the last note in the exercise but that not noted in the book. Your just supposed to know that.. I'm going to finish the book but I'd never recommend it to anyone...I seriously would prefer my money back.."
1,Expensive regular toothpaste,"I have been using this product without the whitening accelerator and my crest whitening toothpaste that i purchased for less than 4 bucks works much better. This item leads you to belive that it will still whitten your teeth without buying the accelerator, but i guess you do need it because without it it just doesn't work. In addition, the whitening accelerator runs somewhere around $40 to $50. So i don't know how well this product works without the combination of the two, but just the toothpaste alone does not do anything!"
4,helps avoid plaque build-up,"My dentist recommended this (and sold it at cost--$12), so I tried it. I think it helps whiten my teeth a little (I don't use the companion whitening product), but not enough to justify the price. The real reason I keep using it is that it has eliminated plaque build-up between my lower front teeth. I flossed everyday, and I still used to get a yellowy build up between cleanings. No more! For that reason alone, I think it is worth 3 times the price of regular tooth paste."
3,doesn't whiten my teeth,This toothpaste feels really good on my teeth. It leaves fresh clean feel after brushing. My teeth feel extra smooth!! I don't see any significant improvement on the color of my teeth.
4,"""The Icon"" and ""Freedum fighter"" is very good!!","I have a same title CD of Import version. This CD contains a bonus truck: The Icon and Freedum fighter. I think these performances are very good and are the most beutiful and strongest tunes in 70's American hard and progressive Rock. I recomennd Import version, if you want this one."
2,Not as strong the second time around,"While it's hard to go wrong with Kenny Loggins, this CD was disappointing to me. As a big fan of his previous ""Pooh"" release (House at Pooh Corner), I expected to love his latest CD just as much. I found it a bit flat ... not as engaging or heartwarming as ""House at Pooh Corner"" at all. If you own neither, I suggest passing on this CD and going straight for the first one."
3,More from Pooh Corner.,Good songs but it doesn't have the heart of the first one. It seems more...I don't know... commercial. Half the songs are from recent movies.
4,"Big, silly, melodic fun","What an unexpectedly cool find. _Blame Everyone_ reminds me of nothing so much as Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine at their creative peak, updated for the 21st century with even louder guitars. The one-two-three sonic punch that opens this album -- two-thirds of which was featured on multiple movie soundtracks, and justifiably so -- is hard to beat for making that new set of speakers earn their keep, or for blasting with the top down on a summer day. Things fall off surprisingly little after that, and the anthemic ""As Good As It Gets"" in particular pretty much lives up to its name.I highly recommend taking a chance on this one (and not even all that much of a chance, given how ridiculously inexpensive the used copies available here tend to be at this point).""No brakes but you know we got a radio / You gotta move when we're rockin' on your stereo""? They really do have a point there."
3,Almost Amazing,"I purchased the French version (eventhough I speak a little) and immideatley fel in love with it promping me topurchase the english version as well. While the songs are truly amazing, I can't help but acknowledge the fact that most of them sound too similar and that most of the melody is a bit slow or 'romantic'. But if you like the story of Nore Dame de Paris or musicals in general then this is an excellent pick. But if you want something more upbeat and even darker, get Der Glockner von Notre Dame which is more gothic and powerful."
1,Disappointment in the Cathedral,"After hearing the wonderful French CD, the English recording is a big letdown. I saw the great new English language production which just opened in Las Vegas, and couldn't wait to get a recording in English. Unfortunately, this is the only one that's available, and it is only a pale imitation. Even though the music is the same, and the English lyrics are great, there's something missing on this CD. First of all, most of the exciting dance music is left off. This record is primarily ballads. Secondly, compared to the original performers on the French CD (and the American performers in Las Vegas) the singers don't seem very passionate. Which is surprising since several of the singers on the English CD are the original French singers. The only good thing on the album is Celine Dion singing a bonus track. At least she knows how to put some feeling into it. In summary, if you want the real thing in an album, get it in French."
5,Adore it!,"My son and daughter-in-law saw the stage show in Las Vegas and went out and purchased the cd. While visiting in Florida, he played it for me and I loved it immediately. I went and bought it myself, and although I have nothing to compare it too...i.e.the French version...I am completely in love with the writing and the arrangements. I play it over and over again, whether at home or in the car. I am now very curious to hear the French cd, although I do not speak the language. Sometimes I feel audiences want too much. They don't want to ""work"" at all by opening their hearts and spirits and allow the music and voices to flow in. I followed along with the written lyrics, and was right there with the charactors. So all of you who felt this recording was boring...open up and try again. I love it."
5,"Serengeti, nothing else...","Polarmax drivers sunglasses are the best sunglasses money can buy. They are lightweight, comfortable, they eliminate nearly all reflexions. They give you a sense of security while driving. You can see anything. Your vision is crystal-clear."
5,"What Marlene was to Berlin, Alison Fraser is to New York!!!","I don't live in New York anymore but I love to listen to this CD and remember what a sexy great town it is, evoked so richly by Ms. Fraser's sexy great voice. This album only reinforces the sense one has that Ms. Fraser is the only young musical theatre star who could have held her own against the legends of the 20s, 30s and 40s. She has wit and style, a supple voice, great material, and is a wonderful actress to boot - I was fortunate enough to see her on stage in ""Secret Garden"" and ""Romance Romance.""Truly, she sounds like no one else. Anyone who wants to hear what a real singing star sounds like, or who - like me, wishes they were in New York - need only put this CD in, sit back and enjoy."
3,Quality was disappointing,"I followed the advice of prior purchasers and ordered a full size longer and wider, so fit was fine. However, the stitching on the inside of both insteps was not finished properly and was very stiff, which resulted in scratching and chafing of my instep. I specifically ordered these slippers for my post surgical healing and, since I was able to trim the bad stitching with a razor blade to make the slippers satisfactory, I have given them 3 stars. Although the leather slippers look good, truly, the workmanship of Daniel Green has diminished. If you're an old customer of Daniel Green, you're going to be disappointed."
1,Extremely disappointed,"Years ago, Daniel Green was THE slipper to buy. Unfortunately, their quality has deteriorated over the years to the point where I would never recommend them.First, they are not true to size. I had read about this on many reviews, so when I ordered the slippers, I chose one width wider, and a half size longer. That worked.They are very shoddily made. I bought the slippers in gold. In just a few weeks the color seemed to be coming off in spots.After about a month, the material at the toe part of the slipper started to bunch up.Stay away from this slipper. They are definitely not only not worth the money, but are not worth any price."
1,Disrespectful,"I think if you consider yourself a true fan of Selena, and want to keep her memory alive, you should not read this book. This is a WAIST OF TIME AND STUPIDITY. Mrs. Ararras needed money at that time (I believe) and she used murder Yolanda Saldivar just to sell.(well, I really do not think she sold many copies though). I do not understand how the media keeps giving credit to this crazy Yolanda Saldivar who is desperately looking for attention in any way! there is no secret mentioned in this book, because there is no secret at all. period. Selena was killed by her ""friend"" but Mrs Arraras tried to show the human side of Yolanda Saldivar...but there is no such side of her. It is just a waist of time.... I read it and I do not recommend this, at all...."
1,Poorly written with little journalistic integrity,"Poor Selena. This book only brings to light half-truths and lies, all under the guise of ""journalism"". On page 250 Ms. Arraras writes: ""If you have read this far--and if you've read between the lines--you know that I have revealed much in an indirect manner."" I read that far and the only secret I can ascertain is that you can get published simply because you interviewed the murderer on television, rather than because you have something new to say. Selena had a short and interesting life, and it's too bad Ms. Arraras found it more important to tantalize with innuendo than to actually do some reporting."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"Arraras is such an arrogant woman that she took up a lot of space saying how she wasn't taking sides, when that is clearly not the case. She puts Saldivar on a pedistal and makes her out to be the victim. What is this ""secret"" she talks about? Apparently she knows, but because of a vow to not tell, she wastes the reader's time with a bunch of crap. If this secret is supposedly going to clear Saldivar, then just say it. I bet there is no secret, just a bunch of garbage to get people to waste their money on a book that is poorly written and one sided."
1,dumb book!,Selena was a good person. Why did this author have to make stuff up? if anyone wants to read a real book about selena read to selena with love by chris perez. That's a very good book and he did not make stuff up!
3,"Good study resource, not as readable as I hoped","I like the parallel column format and the layout of the book. The text is easy to read, the markup format is clear, and the volume is a comfortable size for my hands.It only includes the verses which changed from the King James Version, not the entire text of the New Testament. I had hoped to use it as a single volume study source, without having to continually cross reference to my own copy of the New Testament. That would have worked better for me than flipping back and forth between my copy of the New Testament and this side by side comparison of the changed verses.It would also have been nice to have the ""difference markup"" somehow show the differences between NT1 and NT2 in those sections of the Matthew where there were differences. It takes some detailed reading to discover the differences. I've started circling the differences in my copy so they are more apparent the next time I read them."
1,OMG - from an adult perspective,"When I was a little kid I saw this movie and loved it. Years later images popped in my mind of this movie, but I had no idea what it was called and I wanted to see it again. Internet searching provided me with the name and through ebay I purchased the DVD. I could not believe how bad today this movie is (to an adult). Horrible acting, horrible visuals, music, the list goes on. I wish I could forget it. :) This is definitly a cute movie and kids will love it, but beware if you are an adult."
5,a must have,this movie was fantastic!! it really hit home. i cant even explain how i felt when i watched this movie all i know is that it took me at least an hour to quit cring.
4,The Christmas Shoes,"Although ordered at the same time as the two other movies I purchased, approx. (Dec. 19), this one arrived only last week (approx a month later) seems an awfully long time and not sure why."
4,Love but...,"I was disappointed this movie wasn't closed captioned. I'm hearing impaired and find it easier to have the closed captioned. I loe this movie, though!"
5,An amazing movie.,This will be a Christmas classic. i was deeply moved. The actor and writers did a tremendous job.
4,Nu-School Breaks,"Rennie Pilgrem does well here, keeping the beat broken and the sound funky. There is not too much of this stuff around, at least where I live (Australia). Makes for a fantastic break from the globalunderground-4-to-the-floor stuff that seems to dominate the dance world, but seems to me to just get boring after a while, what with its superstar DJs and repetitive nature. Give me a does of breaks or drum n bass anytime A few techincal criticisms of the relase though.....it is recorded at a too low sound level, meaning you have to turn it up LOUD, and it is just one long track, which makes it hard to skip to your favorite parts.All you need is Love Broken Beats forever"
1,Idiotically Boring,"We watched this video for my Humanities class. I do have to say these videos are extremely boring. From my observation over a third of the class was sleeping. If you feel like showing these videos, make sure you are fully awake."
3,Have not read it yet.,I am currently reading something else. I glanced at the first few pages. I think I will like it. It looks interesting.
4,"Yes, oral Glutathione can work","For aging skin, oral glutatione is great. My skin looks tremendously better when I ingest this product. I'm a 52yo woman. I've read not to take it with oil, but that is when it works best for me. Omega 3's and this product work overnight."
1,Disappointed in the premise,"I was expecting some advice on how to deal with the emotional and psychological issues of losing a parent.Instead, this book was more about shamanism and spirit guides. That would have been fine if the book was titled as such.As far as being a helpful book on dealing with death, it is more of a new age tale."
5,TPB Fans Enjoy!,"If you have seen Trailer Park Boys and like the show, you will love this movie, too. If you haven't seen TPB yet, I suggest watch the show first, maybe a few episodes.Funny show! Great movie!"
1,Hated it,"I enjoy the TV show to no end, the characters are great. But this movie down right sucked. Don't bother."
3,Are you a Trailer Park Boys Fan?,"If you already love Julian, Ricky and Bubbles and are just looking to finish off your collection of the Trailer Park Boys...then by all means, spend your money on this movie. If you are new to the ""Boys"" then your money would be better spent on a season of the series - better yet the entire season of the series!Trailer Park Boys: The Complete SeriesThis movie follows the same premise as pretty much every episode of the series - funny bad idea followed by more funny bad ideas with some recreational drug & alcohol use thrown in with badly quoted sayings - and somehow manages to only contain about a quarter of the laughs. The production values and cameras seem to be of better quality, if that is something that is important to you; but the ""documentary"" style shooting of the original series has always been part of the charm for me. One plus to purchasing this movie is that the extras, especially the lost interviews, are almost worth the price of the DVD for any fan."
1,Do yourself a favor- Buy another Brand!!!,"Don't buy it! The 4 GB mini-Hard drives that come with this unit fail after a few weeks. Trying to get RCA Customer Support is impossible. Their on-line support is pathetic. To get an idea of how bad these units are, just Google ""RCA File System corrupted"" and you'll immediately get 129,000 hits!! You don't even have to reference ""Lyra"" or a model number in the search. That's how bad these are! In fact, there is a Class-Action lawsuit vs. RCA and Thompson, the manufacturer of the Hard-drive pending in NY. So, don't waste your money. Buy some other brand- anything but RCA!"
1,"Zero Customer Service, I would not recommend RCA Products","Recently we have tried 3 different RCA products and had problems with all 3. When you call RCA Customer service, you will end up talking to someone in India or the Phillipines who barely speaks English and doesn't really care about your problems.We bought one of these RCA MP3 players and contrary to what it says, they will not reliably play WMA and MP3 songs mixed together. We had been unable to get an answer from RCA as to why and whether there is a fix. We were lucky enough to be able to return the unit for a refund."
1,Major disappointment,"I received this MP3 player as a Christmas gift. I had problems with it immediately, freezing while trying to switch between songs and such. I think I got maybe a handful of uses out of it before receiving the ""File System Corrupted"" error message by February. I'm extremely disappointed that a company can get away with selling such a majorly flawed product for so much money. Worse yet, the waste of metal and plastic is still for sale!"
4,pretty nice,"this rca lyra isn't all that bad.who does need a ipod?i think ipods are just over priced.this lyra transfers songs from wma real fast.and this is a good price for a 4 gigabite.i just bought this a while ago and still works fine.it come's with a carrying case and earphones,and also a cd that contains lyra jutebox and lyra dj.this is a good mp3 player.anouther thing is it isnt that big.the width is a little bigger than a nuber 2 (pencle).but i would denfinatly buy this.well worth your money.and the two people that wrote this is a piece of junk.they must not know how to use a computer or work the mp3 player."
1,Great player until it just DIED ON ME!,"this player worked out great for me, for a while... i have a mac and i thought it would only work with my PC but i found that it works great with my mac and i can just drag files onto it like i would any external USB storage device... but that was until the day that it just died on me... i have had it less than a month and i was listening to it this morning and everything was fine... then when i went to turn it back on this afternoon it would just keep clicking with the RCA screen in the boot up... then after about 25 seconds it would say ""FILE SYSTEM CORRUPTED!"" this happened out of the blue and there is no way to fix it... i basically just threw away nearly $200!!i DEFINATLY DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!!"
1,If you are in the military stationed overseas don't buy RCA products!,"I bought this MP3 player for my son last July. Six months later, it stopped working. Contacted the company and was told that I had to send the item back and they will issue a replacement after I pay $69.95. I sent the item, and authorized them to charge my credit card. Several calls later and I have not received a replacement. Every time there is a new reason why the item has not been sent. After six months of waiting, I was told today that they cannot ship the item to a Post Office Box. Well, we are in the military stationed overseas and only have a post office box. The funny thing is that my husband came today and said that he found an RCA MP3 player and would like to buy it. My answer: over my dead body!"
2,File System Corrupted,"We bought the RD2762 Lyra in mid 2005 to listen to audiobooks from Audible.com. The placard at the store indicated that this model would support Audible's .aa format, but once we got it home we discovered that it did not. I found an online press release from RCA that indicated the RD2762 would have a software upgrade later in 2005 and would support Audible at that time. It is now mid 2006 and their software still does not support the Audible format... To top it all off, I am experiencing the ""File System Corrupted"" on the Lyra. I have yet to research any solutions or contact RCA about the problem, but I am disappointed in this product.As for the goober that says consumers who experience problems must not know how to use pc's or mp3 players, ID10T."
3,Not my thing,"I had heard a lot of positive things about the author, but the writing and plot unfortunately weren't to my liking. Just a bit too strange, I suppose. Strange can be good, of course, but I guess I didn't get it this time. I'm glad I gave the book a try, though."
2,The Wind-up Bird Chronicle,I am a stranger to Haruki Marukami. His titles intrigued me and I wanted to try something different. I am afraid that this particular novel completely baffled me and I wondered why I bothered. I know that many people are addicted to his writing but this just wasn't for me. I found it rambling and pointless. Maybe I'll try another one of his to see if it hits the spot.
4,Don't pick this up if you have to get up early.,Wind-Up Bird is the first time I've encountered Mr. Murakami though it most certainly won't be the last. I'm buying a copy now for a niece and I very much look forward to reading everything he has written. It's been a long time since I so enjoyed a novel and it's been even longer since I've encountered such an imagination. Looking for a good time? Start here.
3,Not his best...,"The Murakami book's I've read to date seem splintered for the first half. You stick it out and stay confused, only to see it resolve in the end.I took six months to wade through The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, following the plot but not really seeing the overall point. Perhaps there is no point. The main plot thread found resolution...sort of. Everything else was left dangling in an anticlimax of an ending. It makes me wonder if the publisher made him remove pages.It does, however, have the prototypical Murakami writing style, and his classic characters. But it goes nowhere...for 595/600 pages.I was dissapointed. I recommend Hard Boiled Wonderland or especially South of the Border, West of the Sun."
4,Good - more of the same - but good,"If you are new to Murakami, this novel might not be the first one you should read by this author. I would recommend starting with ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" which, in my opinion, is by far his best. In the Wind up Brid Chronicle you will recognize many of the same types of characters and intriguing plotlines that are laid out in A Wild Sheep Chase. However, in the Wind up Brid Chronicle the plot is not quite as nicely laid out and the book does not flow as well. That being said, Murakami is one of my favorite authors and the Wind up Brid Chronicle is a fine example of his craft."
4,worth the time,"Although this is a long novel, I found it completely satisfying -- and strangely haunting. Murakami's images are vivid, and the tale could be depressing but stands short of that by its dream sequences. Or were they dreams? Murakami replays images, and I, for one, have several etched into my brain, where they can join the likes of Rushdie's."
4,Weird but engaging,"Toru Okada, the protagonist, loses his job, his cat, and his wife and goes looking for all three. His search introduces him to a bizarre collection of characters. Strange occurances abound. In the end, this book has too many loose ends (perhaps because the English translation is abridged) and wanders into the weird too often. I do, however, continue to think about the book after finishing it."
4,Imaginative and Strange,"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is one of the most imaginative and strange books I've ever read. The story is set in modern-day Tokyo, and it contains historical references to the Japanese-Russian conflict in outer Mongolia during WWII, but there all connection with reality ends. The book's characters are unusual people to say the least. Almost all of them seem to be blessed with various other-worldly powers. Viewed in one way, the book is a 600+ page collection of their histories, and it is as a storyteller that Murakami excels --- his descriptions are vivid, imaginative, and quite captivating.But what is the book about? I'm not really sure. Perhaps it is about self-reliance and responsibility. The moral is not as important to Murakami as the stories themselves, and the images and people of this book will probably stay with me for some time. Give this one a try if you're in the mood for a mind-bending read."
1,"Full of sound of fury, signifying nothing","The only thing that kept me going past the halfway point of this 600+ page book was the hope that, by the end, the author would somehow tie together the long and eclectic list of characters and story lines. Alas, there was no attempt at all to do so, the result being a collection of seemingly random people, places, and events that bear little if any relation to one another and serve no purpose in the overall story. I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading the good reviews, but after finally finishing it I wish I had pulled a different book off my shelf."
4,"Wow! --- Well, except for the end.","I hate saying that a book is amazing, until the ending, but this book is exactly that. I will definitely (and have) recommend this book to everyone, because the journey that it takes the reader through is unforgettable."
1,Read anything else...,"Wow, what a disappointment. I bought this book because EW put it high on the list of their best contemporary classic novels.It started out interestingly enough and I like the characters but I realized about halfway through the book that the story was going nowhere! Having a bunch of odd occurrences and characters does not a good story make. I'm trying hard to speak in generalities here so I don't ruin the story for anyone but I shouldn't because there is not much of a story. The ending was the most terrible part of all. You would think all this abstractness would tie in in a satisfying way at the end but not even close. I was actually angry; waste of my time.If you want to read a book that is a little out there but tells a beautiful and haunting story read the Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell instead of this garbage."
2,Interesting but unsatisfying,"The book wasn't hard to get through at all despite it's length, which was nice, but it was seriously flawed. I felt like, to keep things interesting, the author felt the need to cram each chapter with strange phenomena, complex backstories, and fascinating details, which seemed cool at the time, but were ultimately disappointing. Because along with these wonderful tidbits came an unspoken promise, or feeling, that they would all somehow have some significance, that everything would tie together in the end. That wasn't the case. The book just ended, with a startling jolt, and no curiosity was satisfied. It's a book that was seemingly written chapter by chapter, while all along the author had no idea where he was going. None the less, fairly entertaining, so hey."
3,this one not for me,"I loved 1Q84, so I purchased this book. I think the author is great, and there are many interesting things about this book and its characters. But, it just did not engage me. Perhaps the many pages missing from the translation had something to do with it, as previously discussed in other reviews. I appreciate the scholarly comments but it did not make the book more interesting for me. As much as I like the author, I cannot recommend this one to others."
2,nope,i guess one has to be very intellectual to understand this. i only know that there are many things left without explanation and characters comes and goes without resolution.the main story is interesting but since there are too many things happening in this book at the end i didnt care for it.not recommended.adiós.
4,where reality begins and ends,"This book had entered my psyche before I was even aware of it. It altered my dreams, my perception of life, my identity. It does what David Lynch films do to a certain extent yet is much more affecting. You start to see people in the subway differently. I voluntarily isolated myself and revelled in my distance from the world because of this book. I felt as if I know something no one else knows. It is that powerful."
5,Strange but Wonderful.,"Like all of Murakami's works, this is a strange and wonderful book. While in the midst of reading something by this author, I often feel annoyed by the ""strangeness"" of the plot. That sensation immediately disappears once the final page is read, however, and I'm left amazed and impressed by such genius."
5,Difficult but worth it,"Murakami's work is not easily accessible for many readers, but his word play (even in translation) and fantastic character constructions make the work worthwhile."
4,Unique,"A very eccentric plot and story line. The characters were enjoyable, complex, and yet believable.I would read more stories by this author."
1,Boring,"After reading ""Noreign Wood,"" ""South of the Border, West of the Sun,""and a couple of others, I bought this book. What a disappointment. It was boring and It had no point to it."
2,felt tricked,"I feel somewhat tricked by this book. The first half of the book was interesting, and the writing is certainly good. But, I really hated the second half with pointless substory after substory. And the main story itself didn't go anywhere. At the end, it felt like a big waste of time. I was very dissappointed. If there is no ending, no goal to your story, it is fairly easy to make up interesting stuff (which might have been better off as short stories) and keep going on and on, and then just drop the ball. I don't see much value in that."
2,More questions than answers!,"Reading this story causes you to admire the discriptive ability of Murakami but leaves you with more questions and lack of understanding than any book that I've read! The explaination that I read that best explains this was the reader that said 3 chapters were not included by the publisher! I will read more Murakami but with a suspicious ""eye""! one more!)"
2,"blah, blah, blah...","I made a mistake while reading this books and that's the reason I am rating it with two stars instead of one or none. My mistake was that I was reading Faulkner's ""Light in August"" at the same time. Every possible comparison is possibly unfair an out of turn but I couldn't avoid doing it anyhow.Murakami has some good ideas and bring it all together in an attempt to convince us about his hie sociological and metaphysical concerns. I don't deny them but he gives the impression that he is trying too much. Why? Does he try to sell something ? (actually he does, doesn't he?)His prose is silly and boring, possibly good for teenagers though.In my opinion, this book has nothing to offer unless you have plenty of time to kill."
1,"With so many good books out there, don't waste your time with this one","This is the most random and boring novel I have attempted to read since Bleak House. Ironically, on page 380, the author writes, ""This reminded me of several so-called art films I had seen in college. Movies like that never explained what was going on. Explanations were rejected as some kind of evil that could only destroy the films' 'reality.'"" Haruki, I think you just described your book perfectly. If you like reading page after page of what a jobless, friendless guy with absolutely nothing going on his life does to try and occupy his time (insert detailed descriptions of meals prepared, chores accomplished, and random train rides to a train station to stare at peoples' faces all day), this book is for you."
1,SKEETS,"every thing is terrible about this film, from the storyline on down to the acting. Do not waste your money like i did!"
1,WTF??,"This movie was whack! It shouldn't even be associated with the original. BElly was a classic. The story line was dumb as h***. And the ending was worst then the storyline. But I already knew it wasn't going to be good because it went straight to video. Honestly the movie had a little potential because of the actors but they failed miserably. Sorry to break it to you but the highly anticipated sequel to one of the greatest movies ever, tanked."
4,The Reality of Millencolin,"Anyone who listens to one type of music simply because they wanna be coo is cheating themselves of the opportunity to hear a quality compilation by Millencolin. Sure, maybe they slowed down their beat a bit, but is loud, fast paced music the only basis to punk's appeal? No, the smooth progressions, creative bass lines, and variatons in each song's style create a true punk masterpiece. Hardcore ""punk only"" fans may deem Pennybridge Pioneers a pebble in the mountain of punk music, but those who truly recognize music for it's creativity will agree Millencolin's newest album towers over the rest."
4,A GREAT ALBUM FROM SWEDEN¡¡¡,"THIS IS AN A GREAT ALBUM, I THINK THE RIFFS AND THE SONGS ARE MORE MATURE THAN THE FIRST CDS, I RECOMEND MELODIC PUNK BANDS LIKE PULLEY (THE NEW ALBUM)STRUNG OUT, SAMIAM, FACE TO FACE(THE NEW ALBUM), THE GET UP KIDS. LISTEN THE EMO STYLE¡¡¡ HERE IN PUEBLA A SMALL PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAN I KNEW, AND FRIENDS LISTEN THE PUNK ROCK AND I DONT KNOW WHY? IS AN EXCELLENT GENRE OF MUSIC THAT MAKES ME HAPPY¡"
2,Blind Promises (Love Inspired),"I have been a fan of the author for years, but I think that this has to be the worst book that she has written. The plot was dull and the characters were unrealistic. The only thing this book inspired me to do was take a nap."
1,Good grief,"...It was so one-dimensional and so populated with cardboard characters that it bored me silly by page 10. I did persist and finished it but really don't see how this can be ""love inspired"" in any size, shape or form. If it is supposed to be about people of faith, it gave us a man who handled his lady roughly, raged at her and never seemed to me, at any rate, to grow up, find any spiritual dimension or develop any real feeling towards those around him. The inference made to the heroine's mother being better off dead, bearing in mind she had been an unhappy alcoholic, was incredible to say the least and was really quite offensive. The dialogue was strictly B movie and stilted and strained. Also, the book was clearly given a bit of a re-write to bring it up to date (eg the use of computer technology circa 2003 and not the early 1980s when it originally appeared) but it didn't work..."
5,Bits and Pieces,"In the world of television soundrtracks there is one name that stands above the rest...FRED MOLLIN! I recognize his distinctive sound on all of my favorite shows, but on the Forver Knight soundtracks he rises above them all. Greater still we get excerpts from our favorite actors. This is a must have!"
3,Confederation,"I watched Confederation and enjoyed it. The characters were well played by this group of people that I understand did the movie just because they like to act and they believe in the potential of James Clement. They are proud to be a part of creation from a young director, writer, producer,and everything else pretty much single handedly. I liked the character ""Tinman"" alot. The special effects in the movie were very good considering that Mr. Clement reportedly had pretty much a zero dollar budget without the fancy labs, makeup artist,lighting,etc. All the costumes i guess was homemade. They were very good considering this. I hope to see more works by James Clement in the future. With the proper break and financial backing, this man could really amaze us in the future. I am happy to have bought the movie and be a part of a spirted crews ambition to achieve and entertain."
5,Every Recipe Has Been Delicious!,"I got this as a gift from a friend and was a bit skeptical as I'm not much of a Junior League type of gal. However, every recipe I've made has been wonderful. The Sausage Bread appetizer was a huge hit at a party and has been requested since. The Chocolate Bar cake is divine and not very hard for a homemade cake. Chocolate cream cheese frosting - yum! Recently, when pressed for time, I tried the Chocolate Kahlua cake that starts with cake mix. My friends were impressed! Very delicious!! I would definitely get this cookbook. It's a good mix easy and more effortful recipes."
4,Junior League of Fort Lauderdale Cookbook,"You can always count on the Junior League Cookbooks. They are the best, and wonderful recipes. I love all the fish recipes, and maybe it will help my fish cooking skills."
3,It was funny for 10 pages,"After the first 10 pages or so, the joke got old.OK, I get that it's a parody, but a parody can only go so far. Once you recognize that by Clements' exaggerating Dan Brown's hyperbolic writing just a little you realize what a bad writer - albeit great story-teller (not the same thing)- Brown truly is, ""The Asti Spumante Code"" gets very old very quickly.I would only recommend the book with the caveat that it's silly."
3,Returned,The bra was too long through the torso but was of good quality. It also appeared to be smaller in size than the brand originally worn.
1,Worst Cycling Book Ever,"As a huge fan of pro cycling, I couldn't wait to read this book. I was very disappointed when I did. It's poorly organized and written, and it reveals nothing we didn't already know about the life of a pro cyclist.I read it about a year ago while I still believed in Lance and Postal. Looking back, now that we know what was really going on ""Inside the Postal Bus,"" I can only conclude this book is a very poorly written fraud."
4,"Listen, really listen","I can't tell what I like best: the vocals, the audio quality or the songs. So where's that leave things? Simply put, this is an altogether splendid CD. SACD is, of course worth the additional cost if sonics mean anything to you. Not to take anything from Ms. Barber's fine songwriting, but her intrepretation of The Doors's classic ""Light My Fire"" really does just that for me."
4,Dead Prez : An Mind Opener,"It's been a while since we heard some truth about the reality that faces the Black Man. It has now come in package of Stic Man & M1. This is one of the best albums I've come across in a while, phat beats & a message to go with it. But some of point brought on by dead prez are over the top. Like not getting educated the way today's society requires you to, etc. But the stuff about ... being brain washed by the media is all true.And just don't think like average, & you will what I'm talking about.UHURU"
3,Cry Story,"This is a good cd because theres talent and good beat.The whole cry story bout how bad blacks have it really kills this album ,this is the year 2004'we all equally treated.I could see this album droppin back in the late 80's and then it would have made a lil more sense."
1,garbage,"I am black, I am proudly black. But, being proud of who you are don't mean you gotta go blaming everyone else, especially white people, for your troubles. If Dead Prez fell this way, why are they signed to Loud, a label run by Steve Rifkind, a white guy. How come when a white guy says bad stuff about blacks he is considered racist, yet when black people say bad stuff about white people, it is considered good, healthy pride? It's complete garbage. If there ever were black skin heads, dead prez would be it."
4,powerful and thought provoking,"i purchased this cd upon recomendation from a professor. i am studying urban education, and this album touches on the topic in many ways. i was surprized to listen to this album and realize that it was changing my thoughts on urban education in more ways than just the lyrics presented that focus on the issue. this album challenged the way i currently think, and made me concider if i was part of the problem or part of the solution. i haven't heard music with this much political energy come out of my generation before."
1,Not Good,"Political and racial messages aside, this album is very bad. The monotonous lyrics and insipid beats make my ears want to escape from the wackness that is Let's Get Free. Now, there is one exceptional song on this album. Track #15, You'll Find a Way is very good. An instrumental song seems extremely out of place on this horror of an album, but at least it's well done. With the muted cornet, drum beat, and piano this track makes one wonder as to what was going on during the rest of the album. I recommend not getting this album because it is very poor. If I want to listen to a speech about equality I will do so. I do not need noise from Dead Prez. I urge people not to buy this."
1,SUCKS,This product didn't work my phone wouldn't charge with this but worked fine on the new one i bought. I wouldn't ever buy anything from that company again.
3,OOook,"I thought this book was going to be another fantastic King work. It was just ok, and the whole idea was kind of hokey. There weren't that many times when I stoped reading for a moment only to find myself biting my nails in sheer nervousness. I gave it a three for a decent effort."
3,Not Up To His Usual Par,"I don't want to give anything away, in case you do read the book, but I really couldn't connect to this book the way I always have with Kings earlier works. I usually love his work, but Rose Madder seemed forced, stunted and at times confusing.When I was done I felt empty, without any closure. Save your money for one of his better works."
3,Good at first but then...,"Rose Madder is the story of a woman who has been abused by her husband for fifteen years and decides enough is enough and leaves while he is away at work.I felt this book was a fantastic piece of literature up until King made it into a fantasy type of story. It was really believable at first, both the story and the characters. I was hooked into it the moment I picked it up and through most of it I could not put it down. I was curious to see what would happen to Rose on her quest to escape her horrible life and her husband, Norman, was one of King's best villians.I know King is a horror writer and tends to add a bit of the supernatural to his novels but I think this one should have been the exception. I feel he ruined a perfect story by adding the silly stuff at the end.But overall, I would still recommend this book. It was one of his best.P.S. Please read my other reviews."
2,King puts up a brick.,"This was the only King book I couldn't finish.The characters are flat and to much like characters from other King novels. The violence and gore is really way to much and is a way over the top. He also makes this book Dark Tower related which was the last straw and made me return it, The Dark Tower thing just didn't work. Over all this book is too much a combination of his other books to work well as one book. It's Cujo combined with the Shining and a dash of Desperation. The end result isn't pretty."
2,King's worst,"I've never read anything like this from King. Go ahead and get it but I'll tell you its terrible. This may be a good read for a woman, but I think if your a guy I doubt you will find it interesting. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but I'm giving it to you straight, man."
4,"A dramatic and terrifying thriller, of brutal spousal abuse.","ROSE MADDER is one of the best books that I have read that has made my stomach cramp up in pain of the thought that somthing so terrible could happen to a human living creature. This unexpected feeling of fear is going to drive you to the edge of your seat. You will want to skip a head to find out what happens next. From the picture on the wall turning into reality to the women with the hideous face, that you dare not look into, you will fall in love with another one of Stephen King's novels. If you love unexpected things, then you will love ROSE MADDER by Stephen King."
4,Rose Madder,"I deeply admire Stephen King for his intelligence and contribution to society. I really enjoyed this book, especially the reality-based part. In fact, I read a straight 12 hours one day in order to finish the book. Both main characters kept my undivided attention throughout the story. However, on page 322 there was an editing error that had Norman shooting people without a gun in his pocket. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the reading, and I would recommend this book to others."
4,Almost 5 stars,"I would have given this book 5 stars except for the out-of-place fantasy sequence in the middle. I think it detracted from the story because it seemed like it came from The Dark Tower novels (don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the Dark Tower, just not in the middle of an otherwise somewhat reality-based novel).Mr. King's portrayal of the abusive husband who's also a serial killer on the side is chilling. I can imagine that's really how people like that think. And once again, his understanding of the battered woman is evident."
3,Not one of Stephen King's Best,I found this book to be very slow and strange in some parts. It was more like a romance novel then a thriller.
3,Greek Myths meet Stephen King with...,"...a touch of The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe!!I enjoyed (if that's the right word) the concept of the story and felt that King seemed to have remarkable insight into what the main character, Rose was feeling. He rather scarily manages to get into the head of a psychotic abuser too.However I just didn't feel very happy with the ending. I felt it had kind of lost it's way from the stark reality of most of the book to a vague unsatisfying surreal feel.I would still recommend reading it, but the ending just left me feeling a little cheated."
3,Stephen King's ROSE MADDER,"After years of mental and physical abuse by her husband, Rosie Daniels is shocked into making a stand when seeing a single drop of blood. With no contacts, no skills, and nowhere to go Rosie finds strength in a peculiar painting she finds in a pawn shop. Slowly she begins creating a new life. But she knows her husband Norman is searching for her with instincts developed from being a career cop. If this story had been written by just about any other writer of horror it would be considered a success. But King has always proved himself a cut above the rest and ROSE MADDER is run of the mill by his standards. However, he still does a great job developing the two main characters. Watching Rosie blossom and Norman regress is a real treat..."
5,The Best Book I ever Read !,"I read this book in three days thats how exciting it was and its about 500 Pages long!!! I Couldn't put it down. This book really puts you into the life of Rose. You feel apart of her life. Its mysterious,romantic,and scary. If I had to recommend any book this would be the one!"
2,I expected better than this from Mr. King.,"I managed to drag through this book in 4 days. Rose Madder lacks any hint of suspense. It spends too much time ""inside"" the painting. There is too much detail in some parts, and not enough in other places. If this was another author, the book might have a 5 or 6, but this is the renowned Steven King, who has been too streaky when writing over the past couple of years"
2,thumbs down!,"I am amazed at the positive reception this book hasreceived! Since ""The Tommyknockers"" King's writing seemsto me to have gone steadily downhill - and sadly thisbook keeps up the trend. Cliched, predictable withtwo-dimensional characters, the ""supernatural"" part istagged on clumsily - perhaps had this been a straight-fowardnovel about a battered wife it would have been better? Itdoesn't even have the Stephen King ""feel"" that earliernovels had in abundance. A BIG disappointment!"
2,Looking to make your Velcro dollar go farther? Fuggeddaboudit!,"Compared to the 3/4"" the 2"" Velcro is really disappointing.First, unlike the 3/4"" the backing material is lacking that extra width that allows easy separation, you have to resort to a razor blade to separate this stuff--it's maddening! Second, the stickiness isn't even close to the 3/4"".I'll stick with the 3/4"" Velcro! (sorry)"
1,Worthless in Florida Sun,"I needed something to secure some solar screens over vinyl windows. I installed this to the vinyl window and the metal frames, worked great in the morning when I did it. By the end of the day my screens were on the ground, The glue did not hold at all. Yes it was the industrial Velcro. I did not want to drill holes in my vinyl window frames. I have no choice now. Do not use in Florida Sun."
5,Velcro,What can you not do with Velcro! I bought it for hanging acoustic foam on walls and I have found many more uses for it.
5,not so bad...,"Everyone needs velcro at some time or another...this stuff is pretty darn strong and the price is not that bad. Even at Home Depot, it isn't cheap...good to buy it here!"
4,cat loves this,my cat loves this she sits and stares at me then the mouse to see if I am going to pick it up. she will chase the beem for ever if I would let her. shipping though hugh!
5,Contemporary Jazz at its finest,"OK, I'm relatively new to jazz; does that disqualify me from writing a review of this terrific CD. Probably. But don't let that stop you from buying this gem. Paul Taylor's musical talent and creativity oozes from this piece of art. Enjoy!"
5,Qualtiy foundation for moderate prices!,"This foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look, while also giving a good coverage. I've been using this foundation for years, all year long, and it is one of my favorites. Not too heavy and not too light, it's the perfect foundation.Being Asian American and with a light complexion, finding a good color match had always been a problem unless I spent $40 for a bottle of makeup. Zhen is one of the best deals around - clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside!"
2,disappointing!,"There are a few good tracks on this CD, but mostly they just took an opera track and put a beat to it, and didn't even bother to match up the two. A lot of the times, the beat is a little off from the rest of the song, which is annoying. When I bought this CD, I was looking for something more like the Opera diva song from the 5th element. Execpt for 2 tracks, I was disappointed. I'm sure there's something better out there that mixes trance with opera."
1,This sux!,"I love this kind of music, but this disc is awful. The sound quality is not great. The tracks themselves are not mixed very well - and they all seem to be done in the same or similar style: fade in electronica version of the classical theme, overlay beat that doesn't match, degrade from there. It's awful and unoriginal. I wish there was a money-back satisfaction guarantee - I would take advantage of it. I'm very disappointed."
4,Worth the Read for the Spiritually Minded,Hyrum Smith of Franklin Covey lays out some sound ideas and thoughts on the plan of salvation and what role pain plays in our daily lives and how to keep it in perspective. He draws on some personal examples of himself and poor choices he made to lay out his points. I found it worth the read and a solid perspective for me anyway on some of lifes daily issues.
1,what is this,"i finf it so uncane to need to stay on this tablet so long , to be remined the mess i recieved."
4,BEAUTIFUL !,"This is wonderful music. It kind of reminds me of the music of Yanni. The melodies are so haunting. The artist is a very talented pianist. I've played for years, and I'll never catch him! Just great stuff. I'm on the lookout for another."
2,To big!,"I gave a low review, because the filter was too large for my Coffee maker, now this could be a coffee maker error, but I'm not to sure of that. Also it was bent in a few places, which was unfortunate for the price they charge. I did not return the item, because I'm giving it to my mother for Christmas, hopefully she will get some use out of it...."
2,not worth the money,"I thought I would spend the money and get the best but it turned out to be just talk. I was using the melita 12 cup drip method grinding with a blade grinder - melita paper filters. Taste was supurb but the filters were expensive in long run. Well, the swissgold, using the same grinding method, made fine coffee except for thesludge at the bottom of the pot.The only way I could deal with the problem was to hand make a muslim liner that I place between the melita cone and the swissgold. So really, my expensive gold filter is just used to hold my handmade liner in place.To be fair, I bought an new Bodum burr grinder (thinking my blade grinder was grinding too fine), using the recomended setting for drip pots. The result... still the sludge, but not as much.The only good thing about this swissgold is the extender that comes with it, which makes it into a 12 cup filter and the gold looks good on the shelf."
2,Where is the beef?,"I did get one soundbite that I hope I can use in my life from this book, ""Be yourself, unless you're a jerk"". However, I got so tired of: be nice, have integrity, be an example, on page after page I was only able to make it through half of the book. All of that is important, but they covered that quite well in kindergarten. If you pick it up to read on the plane bring a backup book; you will need it."
1,Overall Disappointed,"With all the stellar recommendations for this product one might expect an above average result. My teeth are no more whiter than when I began using the product over six weeks ago. I like the toothbrush and the toothpaste has a nice refreshing taste, but I can get my teeth equally clean with a $2 tube of Colgate. Perhaps it is best utilized by those who have had their teeth professionally whitened and need a maintenance program."
5,Truly as good as it gets...,"These albums were legendary when they were released more than twenty years ago, and they have surrendered nothing to the intervening years. Aside from the obvious technical mastery and consummate professionalism that both Ray Brown and the late Jimmy Rowles brought to the procedings, what made these sessions unique was the telepathic interplay between two very distinctive musical personalities.To put it bluntly, neither of these storied artists ever released finer recordings than these. The performances are spontaneous, quirky, and yet never mannered, and virtually every tune receives close to a definitive performance - even the hackneyed Bert Kaempfert ""L-O-V-E"" comes off as a masterpiece. The recorded sound on the original records was demonstration quality, and of course on CD you're tempted to offer the performers a drink. At Concord's ""2-fers"" price this is more than a bargain - it's a steal."
5,Loved by a 6 yr old,I bought this as a present for a 6 yr old boy. His mother tells me that he loves this toy.
2,Missing Parts on my son's birthday,"We ordered this and my 3 yr old son opened it on his birthday. It was missing the last leg (the 3rd) of the base. We were careful to look around the entire package and were sure that it wasn't there. I guess given the price, its not that big of a deal, but we weren't happy w/the end product all the same. We could still make do by holding it, but he couldn't use it independently. Do we really want to pay to return it and wait for it to come back when our son was excited about it? Probably not. I will email Amazon and/or the company to see if they try to make it better."
2,not durable,"The idea is good, but the rocket itself is not durable. My 3 year old broke all the rockets into pieces in one day. May be good for an older kid"
3,Works but very fragile,"Although this item shoots up as high up in the air as it says, you have to be careful where to shoot. Countless times we had to go over to the neighbor's yard or try to get the rockets off of our roof. It's a good idea to buy the refill rocket kit. Additionally, it needs good care, like a grandmother. Don't leave them laying around outisde. They're not weatherproof, and because it's foamy, you will wake up to chewed rocket pieces all over your yard if you have pets or other animals in your neighborhood. Overall, it's fun but won't last long."
2,Doesn't work very well for the age group indicated,"Our 4 year old had a very difficult time with getting this to work. His hardest stomps barely got the rockets off the launch pad, even when he was jumping off a bench onto the stomp pad. Our 10 year old had no problem getting great high launches off, so I know the product works okay, I just don't think its operation is well designed with little kids in mind."
2,Disappointed,"Based on all the previous reviews I bought StompRocket as a gift for my 3 1/2 year old grandson. We put it together the first day he had it and he loved it. So did we. BUT - the next day things began to fall apart - 2 rockets lost a fin, the screw holding the air tube to its post just would not stay tight and had to be retightened every other time a rocket was launched. The 2 pieces of the stand kept coming apart if handled too quickly. What a disappointment. If I had bought this at a store and not online I would have returned it. I see it is made in China which might be the reason for its shoddy components."
3,fun but the base falls apart easily,"My kids enjoyed this for a few days, but the base constantly falls apart and they are asking me to put it back together. It is a cheap toy so maybe my expectations are too high, but I'd be willing to pay for a few more screws to keep everything together better."
3,Good,"This thing is so darn cheap. You will need zip ties if you want the plastic stand to stay on. Very poor design, they drilled a hole through the hose! You're probably losing 25% of the air around the small bolt. This also takes the air 5 times longer to come back in to the jump pad! It did work and goes very high when you have 200 LB adult jumping on it jack rabbit style. Great exercise for a 2 year to go back and fourth fetching the rockets :) They have to be making a killing off these has to be 50 cent or less in production."
1,MIssing pieces!!!,I couldn't really review this item because the wingnut that holds the tube onto the stand wasn't included in the box. It's always great giving a kids a toy for his birthday that he can't even play with. Thanks a lot.
5,Absolutely awesome!,"We've had this for a year (bought for my daughters 3rd birthday). The launcher and rockets have lived outside the whole time, and are still in good shape. Kids love it. Once the excitement of launching them wore off, they played 'catch the rocket' trying to catch it when it landed. Sure, plenty have wound up on the roof, but they roll off most of the time, and if not, that's what Daddy and the ladder is for."
5,Great Fun for Great Value,I bought this toy for a friend's 3 year old and he absoluately loves it. He was shooting rockets the whole time I was there. For such a great price it is hard to go wrong with this toy. That is if you don't mind getting a couple rockets in the face:)
5,Wonderful Buy!,"My kids LOVE this toy. It's cheap, safe, and they have had many hours of fun with it. My 2 year old is just big enough to get the rocket up in the air. Both her and my 4 year old love seeing how high they can get the rocket to go. I wish I had one of these when I was a kid!"
5,WOW! This gift was a suprise hit!,"Bought this for nephew's 4th birthday. Was not even the main gift.....but all else was forgotten once this was put together (easily). His parents report that it has not lost its appeal weeks later and it is tough to get him to leave it it when it is time.A lot of fun for all to stomp on and see how high it goes! Description is accurate, though I did not see if it glowed or not. Doesn't matter. 5 stars!"
5,Loads of Fun,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas and it was a big hit or I should say it was a blast! He not only stomped this toy to launch it with his feet, but being a rambunctious boy he stomped it with his knees, his stomach, and his bottom. We finally had to make him stop when he wanted to stomp it with his head we all had a great time with this toy, he even had fun retrieving the rockets.I would recommend this product to a friend."
5,Couldn't ask for better,"Love it. protects my guitar very well. inside storage will hold my picks, tuner, extra set of strings and even my strap. I accidentally got it wet once and it maintained a seal so everything inside was dry! Totally a bargain."
5,nothing quite like it!,"Now here's a rare treat... A clever, zany romp in the continuing adventures of Little Vampire. It's an unpredictable, rambling adventure, brimming with inventiveness and full of heart -- and it's a comic book. Kids 6 and up will find lots to delight in, but it's aimed at the 10 and up, who will revel in the wit and exuberant artwork. I'd bet the books in the Little Vampire series become classics in no time. Definitely nothing else like these.Be sure and get the first book LITTLE VAMPIRE GOES TO SCHOOL if your young reader doesn't have it already. One of the few books he or she will rank higher than most video games."
3,Returned it,Just wasn't happy with the look of this donkey. It didn't really look like it's picture - not very cute.
4,Imagining the next phase of jazz,"Curtis Fuller's Imagination is of special interest to me as the 1959 release marks the first documented commercial issue featuring McCoy Tyner (an artist whose output I collect). It would be a few more years, and some time on the bench with his mentor Coltrane, before McCoy's signature left hand sound would develop, but his lightning right hand was already in full effect. Witness pretty much any solo on this collection...A reasonably straightforward hard bop set that somehow stands out...there is just enough idiosyncrasy in the compositions and solos to foreshadow where jazz was heading as the new decade was arriving.The set takes its name from the one standard included, with the rest of the program consisting of Fuller originals. All arrangements were by Fuller.Available digitally and on CD, copies of the vinyl appear to be in short supply. If you have any leads on one please do let me know! Thanks."
4,GundamSideStory:0079,I really like this game.It's kinda short but once you connect with it you'll never stop.Beat the game get the codes.I hope you dont expect GundamWing cause this is far from it.
5,"Great, great, great","This is an amazing CD, both sonically, and musically. Best appreciated on an audiophile level system. For me, the best track is ""Too rich for my blood""--one of the best tracks I've ever heard. A must for people who really like to listen to music, actively listen."
4,High-End standards,"I spent quite some money for getting the vinyl version and it was worth every penny (I own the CD as well). Someone needs to like Patricia Barber's music; but if you do so, I can only highly recommend the work. Certainly, this LP is often used for presenting high-end equipment and such, the actual value of the music (other than just the good sound quality) might be underestimated. On the other hand, if the equipment is not so good, the actual music might miss a lot or could even become boring. P Barber is not my favorite (voice) but I would highly recommend her to voice-o-phile jazz-lover."
3,it is just ok,ok so the bristle is good but who knows how long it will be like that after several usage. so far it is good as a dry brush only
5,skin brush,"this item arrived in a timely fashion. since it is a brush, there's not much to say. it performs as a brush should."
5,LOVE this brush!,I was skeptical about the wonderful comments on this brush prior to purchasing it. But when I got it in I immediately used it and fell in love. After several uses it made my skin feel so smooth. You can literally feel it stimulating your body's circulation. I love the long handle because I can reach the back of my body with ease. As you brush you can see the dead skin flying off and just knowing I did something wonderful for my body makes me feel even better about this purchase.
5,Excellent skin brush,"The brush is ideal for my needs. It is a DRY skin brush. That means you use it dry, not wet. I normally do a fully body brush down each morning before I take my shower. Brushing helps to remove all the dead skin cells, as well as stimulating the superficial lymphatic system. For me the stiffness of the bristles is just right ... it is invigorating without being irritating. The first few days I used it I had to brush fairly lightly as my skin was not used to this kind of sensation, but after several days it became a pleasant feeling and I was able to apply more pressure. If you have very thin skin or brittle skin you should probably start very, very lightly and as your skin becomes healthier, increase the pressure. I chose this brush over others primarily because it is a vegan product. I am very happy with my choice."
4,Very Nice,"What a great product! The bristles are all natural and sturdy. They brush itself feels great in your hand and is easy to use in the shower. It allows you to get all those hard to reach places.The bristles are firm, but they are meant to be that way so that blood flow will increase through your skin."
4,Pretty good!,It is a great brush. The bristles are very coarse so it will take awhile to get use of it against your skin. It is great quality. The handle does have a tendency to come off easy.
3,Some problems,"The brush does not have a strap as pictured in the amazon photo. The handle wedges into the back of the brush, both items being made of hardwood, they swell and shrink with humidity or lack of humidity. It is a constant problem to maintain this connection. My search was for a shower brush, it is now advertised as a ""skin brush"". I can't think of a use I have for a skin brush."
1,smells AWFUL,"I liked the harsh bristles, but after a few uses this smelled so badly I had to throw away. I really can't describe the smell, it was a rotten, foul odor. I tried many product trying to clean it--soap, shampoo, etc. But, I could never get it to smell nice again. In the trash it went!"
3,Pretty standard fare ......,"Definitely written in Victorian style we find our young heroine, Gillian, working as the 'Mistress of Instruction' or what would be more apt 'Chief Orgy Architect' at Crwford House an exclusive gentleman's club ...Ok the sex is hot and the contrived scenes are yummy but I only gave this book 3 stars since it certainly lacks a story and some level of character development ...."
1,Wow! This is baaaaad.,"This movie really stank hard. The Howard Hughes character appears for five minutes at the beginning, then has nothing to do with anything that happens in the movie until the end. In the mean time, we get to see this looser Melvin and his slutty wife mess up their lives doing one stupid thing after another, together, then apart, then together again, then apart again. At one point they win some money on a lame TV game show, then squander the money. I never really cared about either one of them even though I'm usually a Mary Steenburgen fan. At the end Hughes dies and this will turns up (which Melvin planted) and he defends it in court. Then there's a sequence where he remembers back to his encounter with Hughes... I have to admit I was hitting the scan forward button toward the end so it's a bit of a blur. It's amazing this script ever got funding, much less some of the big name actors who have bit parts in it.Oblio"
4,Quilt National 2005,The photos of the quilts are stunning. The color resolution is good and the photos show detail.
1,Broke the first use,This had the best review on Amazon when I purchased however I was very disappointed when the pump cylinder at the base of the tank cracked. The construction materials and the engineering on this product are poor. I'll be returning this for a refund.
3,Awkward and Uncomfortable,"This sprayer is not for big jobs. If you are looking to treat your entire yard, this is not for you. I tried to use it to spray broadleaf on an average size yard and wore myself out. A full tank is very heavy and I was never able to adjust the pump lever to allow me to pump a full stroke. The pins holding the lever worked themselves out and were lost. I had to replace them with cotter pins. I put it on the shelf and bought a battery powered one and strapped it to my two wheel cart."
5,castle cake pan,This was a very easy pan to use and decorate. I like the idea of being able to create different castle when decorating. I look forward to using this pan again in the future and creating a different castle.
4,Classy!,"I bought this watch to complement the Tungsten Carbide ring I wear on my opposite hand. The silvery gray metal is very classy looking. The watch itself is extremely heavy, but that is because the material is dense and exceedingly solid. The beauty of tungsten carbide is its high scratch resistance (mohs hardness scale of 9), which means it cannot be scratched by most ordinary substances including steel, cement, etc.The watch retains its polish exceptionally well, goes with most colors, and it's sleek enough to wear with a suit or other professional attire. The band feels a little clunky and bulky, and I wouldn't wear it while playing sports or diving, so it loses a star for that, but otherwise it's a great timepiece. I receive compliments on it regularly!"
5,Deserves 10 stars,I used this tent on a recent backpacking trip. Took up very little room in my backpack and was nice and light. Setup was a breeze. I sprayed it with a waterproofing silicone before my first trip. Glad I did because this tent kept me nice and dry during the rain. Fit one person and gear comfortably. Two people would fit without any gear. The zippers worked very well. I would suggest this product to anyone based on my recent experience using it.
2,TEXSPORT CAMO TENT,Side loops are too high thereby pulling top middle of tent downward. Guy ropes fray easy and guy rope tighteners are plastic and subject to break. Setup instructions are incorrect.
4,Good buy for the money,I bought 2 of these for my wife and I to keep in our bug out gear in our vehicles. I don't forsee these tents lasting a long time with continual use but for a SHTF bug out senario for a few days they should work fine. I also have an ENOS 8pt rainfly that I will put over the tents just in case...
2,"Neat, but lacks staying power","The kids liked it and played it with it for a couple days, but I can see the dog is destined for the shelf. After watching it dance to the music for a while, it loses its appeal. When hooked up to an Ipod or MP3 player, it is barely hearable. I haven't seen any other complaints about this, but our dog's volume barely reaches above loud headphones sitting on a table."
3,Short Life-Span,"This was a Christmas gift. It was cute at first, my daughter loved it but then it failed to work after a short time. We changed the batteries, we let it sit for awhile thinking perhaps it was overused but to no avail. I personally feel we propbably received a ""bad product"". It happens with mass production. I am pleased with how well Amazon took care of the return. We will continue to purchase items from Hasbro and Amazon. Buyer beware! THANKS Amazon for your courteous customer service! 5*****! for service!"
4,Good Christmas Classic Movie,This dvd was purchased to replace my vhs version. It is a good Christmas classic that I enjoy watching every December.
4,A true Chritmas classic.,"What can one say with such a great cast, scipt, and subject matter except buy it. The actors bring the story to life. My Christmas librarie has not been complete without this version of ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Now i don't have to shcedule around what some one else decieds to put on TV, Cable, Satalite, or some other form of programming. I can watch it at my timimg. It just doesn't seem like Christmas without it. Great Christmas movie, great acting,and so on. You get both the ""original"" black and white version as well as the ""updated"" color version. Has some good bonus features to."
4,Lovely Holiday Film,"Natalie Wood steals the show as precocious Susan Walker who doesn't believe in Santa Claus. So, who shows up but old Kris Kringle himself, delightfully portrayed by Edmund Gwenn. The sweet and endearing Kringle touches everyone he encounters and proclaims that he is, indeed, Santa Claus. Those who don't believe seek to have him committed and a hearing ensues. Is Kringle successful in proving his identity? Does Susan have a change of heart? Sit back for 90 minutes and see how it all unfolds. You won't be disappointed."
5,Don't need to see it first - the movie stands for itself,"I bought this one for the fact that it has both black & white and colorized. I expect it this week. The excellence of the movie was not in question. This is a classic for the ages. The casting is superb, the story is heart-warming, the acting is engaging. See it if you haven't. Not the remake, though (doesn't hold a candle)."
5,great,"Great Movie!! Have loved this movie for a long time. If you are looking for a great family Christmas movie,then I would recommend this one!!"
4,Great Christmas Season Show,"This show is great for the whole family, warm story, and has lots of laughs. The Actors for the movie seem to just make the show!"
4,Can't Help It,"Awkward, formulaic, even leaden at times: there's just something about the sentiment in this movie I can't resist.This isn't a great movie, but it's a good one. The very premise -- standing up to common sense at a time of the year when we want so much to believe in the inherent goodness of people -- can get you right where you live if you're willing to give yourself over to it. Edmund Gwenn and (a very young) Natalie Wood help us to do just that.The rest of the cast is a bit stilted, but it just doesn't matter. Besides, the 90-second screen debut of Thelma Ritter would make any movie a gem. (Naturally, she manages to do in those 90 seconds what most of the cast struggles to do in 90 minutes: make us believe that what we're watching could be real.) A great story, some great performances and a truly great sentiment."
1,all blue rays suc,"Just don't bother purchasing blue rays, maybe they will go away, there allways a trouble to play and there is no special clarity to them"
3,charming and enchanting,"this story is about santa claus coming to a town and being comitted and even tried.the kids will like it.a cool saying from the movie is""youve heard of the french nation,and the british nation.well this is the imagination"".thats pretty clever!its one of the top 10 best x-mas movies.santas out trying to prove hes the real deal.its an abselutely magical and touching tale.the important message is....do you really knowwhat reality is?could you?"
2,Not colorized -- BIG disappointment,Miracle on 34th Street is the best colorized movie in the history of cinema. This is a CHRISTMAS movie. Christmas is the most colorful time of the year. This is a HUGE disappointment . . . they could have easily put both B&W and colorized versions on one blu-ray disc. What sap in Hollywood made this decision? . . . they just lost tens of thousands of sales because of this major screw up.
5,Excellent Christmas Movie!,"This is a classic to the entire Christmas movie collection that no one should be without! It brings back memories when my husband and I were children as well as now establishing traditions with our grandchildren! If Kris Kringle can change the hardened Macy's executive Doris Walker to believe in Christmas, he will make you into a believe in Christmas too! Merry Christmas everyone! GMomma D"
5,Ginny,EXCELLENT! One of my favorite Christmas movies. Brings back childhood memories. I watch Christmas movies all year long. Love this movie!
2,Who's starring?,"The description here at Amazon was really confusing at first. No mention of Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne or Natalie Wood, the feature stars of this Oscar winning movie. In my opinion, this was the very best version of which there were many. Don't care for seeing it colorized..but someone mentioned it was also in black & white. I'm not planning to buy the blu ray because I don't see how they could improve on the original. Haven't seen anything in blu-ray that warrants buying it, but my husband seems to.As far as the movie is concerned, this is a very endearing film. How can you not love the diminutive Edmund Gwenn as Santa Claus? Natalie Wood does a wonderful job and is very believable when ""Chris"" blows the bubblegum bubble that snaps. If you don't have Miracle on 34th Street in any version, I'd say run out, buy and enjoy it over and over. But I don't think the extra price for blu-ray would be worth it."
5,Joyful,This is a wonderful family-type movie. Natalie Wood is so cute in it. Maureen O'Hara is as good as ever.
2,A Big Long Santa Claus Commercial,"I don't understand what the hype on this movie is when the Christ child is the REAL reason for the season; this world made Christmas too commercial. If He wasn't born, why would Christmas exist at all? This IS a classic, but just don't use it to motivate your children about Santa since the real St. Nick died a long, long time ago."
2,"But Virginia, there is NO Santa Claus","I did not like this movie because its theme is that you should believe in Santa Claus and everything will work out.THERE IS NO SANTA CLAUS!!!I much preferred ""It's a wonderful life"" because there it shows the value of a human being's life and what you can contribute to the world, instead of relying on a mythical santa.Note that I am not running down spirituality. God is real, and people can get real strength from Him, but telling your kids Santa is real is lying.Yes, yes, I know this is just a movie, and you're not expected to believe it. But the whole culture of lying to kids that Santa is real is just reinforced by it."
5,Always enjoyable!!!,This is an all time classic and won't ever lose it's standings as an all time favorite. I don't watch any of the remakes of the good ole classics....nothing better than a couch with your favorite blanket and a great old movie that you don't have to worry about the content being unexceptable for any child to see. LOVE THE CLASSICS!!! :)
4,A Standard Gym Bag,"Nothing flashy here, folks. A little snug, but I've never needed that much space for a change of clothes and some hygiene products. Two side compartments that will take up the middle space if filled up. The navy bag looks nice but doesn't draw attention (which is nice if you don't want stuff taken out of it at the gym).The only drawback (and the reason I dropped a star) is that there's a STRONG plastic smell that lingers in it. I've had it airing out in my room for a month or more now and it still makes any clothes I put in there smell like cheap plastic.Otherwise, a great little gymbag for those of us who travel light to the gym."
1,Region 2 DVD being sold in Region 1?,"This DVD is an import from the European market and does NOT run on US machines. I have 4 DVD players and all 4 rejected this item. Amazon is trying to refund me 8.51 for a 22.98 purchase that THEY SHOULD NOT BE SELLING IN THE US in any case. What a ridiculous rip off. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Amazon is totally irresponsible in selling it. James Blunt himself should be furious. BAD, BAD, BAD deal."
4,A Must For Hardcore James Blunt Fans!!,"I bought ""Back To Bedlam"" last november and warmed to James Blunt's song almost instantaneously, Chasing Time: The Bedlam Sessions is a Live Concert CD/DVD that features some of my favorites off Bedlam as well as two new songs and the B-side to You're Beautiful ""Fall At Your Feet"" (A Crowded House cover), unfortunately I had trouble playing the DVD on my conventional DVD player but was pleasantly suprised when it played on my PC, the concert is great and as a bonus there are videos for You're Beautiful, Wisemen, Goodbye My Lover (starring Mischa Barton), and 2 versions of High also included the making of docs, would've been nice to have watched the DVD in any player but all in all a must for any Hardcore James Blunt fan"
2,Wrong region dvd,"Sadly my dvd won't play either and I was so looking forward to the dvd. While the cd is almost worth the purchase, I really wanted the dvd. Amazon suggested I return it but cannot be certain I will receive the correct region dvd. Mine says NTSC 2,3,4,5 on the back so maybe they saw they NTSC and assumed it was Region 0. In any case, just wanted to share that this looks like it will happen to anyone that orders this. By the way, if you only want the cd it is available without the dvd as an import here on amazon as well."
5,Skins: Les Baxter,"""Skins"" could very well be the best bongo album ever. A true classicfrom the beatnik era. The bonus album ""Tamboo"" is not bad either."
3,old-skool gabba part II,"If you want to hear Hellfish & Producer at their best, I suggest you hunt down ""Constant Mutation"" on Mike Paradinas' Planet label. It's a great mix CD of extreme hardcore techno and the best track from ""No Mistakes Allowed"", ""The Way Of The Homeboy Part II"" is on there too. By the way, the Real Audio link for the second track ""Religion II (Bringer Of War)"" just ahead of this text is in fact a link to the track 5 of that CD, namely ""The Way Of The Homeboy Part II (The Winter Of Discontent)... Everybody messed up that tracklisting."
1,Absolute waste of time,"If you are studying contemporary ethical theories, do not read this book - it will only confuse and mislead you. It is poorly written, devotes too little space to its alleged topic, and seriously misrepresents the history of its topic. The whole presentation is warped around Odell's pet-theory - ""Folk Based Practice Consequentialism"" - a theory that is of no interest to anyone but Odell himself. One can only wonder how a reputable publisher such as Wadsworth could publish such drivel - as a textbook, no less!"
5,Absoutely brilliant!,"Having borrowed and fallen in love with a friend's copy of ""Temptation"" (and never returning it), I was really excited to hear about Lawerence's new CD, especially after seeing him play live. This guy just seems to get better and better. This CD starts at with some moodier tracks by Animated Rhythm and Cassidy and just keeps building with smooth mixes into a mesmerizing climax with a beautiful track by Baby Doc and Lawrence's own ""Rush Hour"". Lawrence deserves major respect for maintaining his underground sound, when many other so called trance DJs have gone the commercial route. I give this a BIG recommendation. Excellent quality trance."
2,Ann Landers or Abigail van Buren?,"Even in the Homosexual world of BDSM: Advice colums are best saved for Ann Landers and Abigail van Buren. This title serves to embarass the gay community of our BDSM community because it is only commentary and the perspective of one individual. Advice columns are that way and dangerous if taken too seriously or for purposes other than for entertainment. Highly entertaining, but nothing more."
4,Not a Bally bavel in sight!,"I was shocked to say the least. Not one mention of bavels. I would have thought that I, Mistress Saskiella of Roxburghshire, would have had a mention also.Damn you people. Damn your foolish ways."
1,vampire Christopher,"Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture. Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha. Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book."
1,Distastefully Disappointing,"This book is one of the worst examples of sour grapes I have ever read. Christopher Byron uses the written word as a weapon against someone who may or may not have ever done something wrong to him.His narrative is angry, ruthless, and one-sided. Byron has chosen to focus on every negative aspect of Martha Stewart's life, by using overly dramatic punch words and accentuating the discrepancies in media stories.As a narrator, Christopher Byron would wonderfully suited for thrillers or suspense novels, but as a biographical writer, his objectivity leaves something to be desired.Martha Inc. is labeled as an unauthorized biography, when in fact it is simple character assassination. Everyone knows Martha Stewart is human and has faults, but with such blatant disregard for the theory of creative license, it is my opinion that Byron steps over the line.This book is senseless and more than a little annoying."
3,Interesting but not that exciting..,"Here is a story of someone with all the normal human faults and foibles that made good.Incredibly ""good"" but chose success over compassion and caring and conscience.But does she really have to be nice to be clever?And I guess that's the question we're left with.Most enlightening but a tad judgemental- I'm left with the feeling of not really liking Martha but definitely admiring her talent, motivation and determination.And since when do we have to like talented people?"
5,Disney fan,"If you are a hardcore Disney fan, you should add this movie to your collection. I had seen it on TV many times before, and just had to own it. Product is basic, just the DVD and case, but quality is excellent."
5,no flats,"Don't like flats. these tubes do the job very well, the price is the best I have seen in the last 100 years. Yes I am that old, and cycling a road bike is the key to forever young without any make up."
5,Pretty good,I've been riding on the Sunlite Thorn Resistant tubes for 6 months now and so far no flats. A bit heavy but being super sturdy I use them on long ride workouts where I don't have to worry about getting stranded in the back country...
2,Heavy and Thick... Not for me!,Honestly it's probably a great tube. I just don't have enough room in my equipment bag for this tube. It's super thick and doesn't compact well. I will stick with normal tube since I can fit two in my bag. Like I said... it looks bullet proof... just not for me!
5,Of course it's good!,I love this author. Tess Gerritsen does not hold back and her writing will suck you in with every chapter.
4,Abridged audio version is very good,"Some of the other reviews lead me to think the editing did favors for the story in this edition. There are a few loose ends, but overall at 4 discs it is an entertaining listen as long as you have the pre-requisite stomach for grisly details. (Carolyn McCormick doesn't have to wear herself out with accents the way she did in Bone Garden)."
5,Right Up There,"After discovering I had skipped this novel, I had to back up and read how the Mephisto organization was introduced, As usual, this was a good read and right up there in the style I have grown accustomed to from this author. This series leaves me anticipating the next mystery with the characters I am so comfortable with."
4,"Great book, even read out of order","I read "" The Surgeon"" a few years ago, and then sort of lost track of the Jane R story line. I didn't realize it had come so far! I regret reading this out of order, but it was still great. Like others, the ending felt, to me, very rushed compared to the slow build-up of suspense during the rest of the book."
5,"Incredibly funny, daft, inspired comedy","This movie has a huge number of very funny moments. It's one of Mel Brooks' funniest films, and I laughed out loud during a great deal of this.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,Now I know what hell feels like.,"This is a terrible, terrible movie. This is not funny at all. Seriously. This is not funny. I had to turn it off halfway through. This is not a joke review. This is mel brooks worst film."
5,This is the funniest movie I have ever Saw,Oh my goodness. This movie is very very VERY FUNNY. I don't care how many movie Mel Brooks makes ....this is his best. To have Gregory Hines as a slave in Rome is genius. While using the enigmatic Madeline Kahn. I couldn't stop laughing through out this entire movie.I think Mel Brooks should make more movie just because of how wonderful this one is. As I am writing this I still can't stop laughing. If you buy or rent one mive this day. PLEASE PLEASE let it be History of the world. I promise you will not be disappointed.
5,The best comedy I have ever seen,"Maestro Brooks has reached the maximum quality a comedy can ever get in the History of the World. From the stone age to the French revolution, you can find the turnaround events of the history in the most funny way one can imagine in this movie. One piece of bad news for the nes who have watched the first part: The second part, advertised at the end of the movie, has never been shot - pity for Brooks fans like myself. ""The producers"", ""High Anxiety"", ""Silent movie"", ""Life stinks"" were a piece of art, but in ""History of the world"", Mr Brooks really outdoes all of his past and future work. Two thumbs up, truly deserved five stars..."
3,"Good, But Not As Good As His Other Work","I love Mel Brooks and his movies, but compared to some of his best, this didn't measure up. I don't hate it at all, it's just a little too slow for me at the beginning. They spend too much time on the Roman period, and it doesn't really pick up until after the Roman times. I loved the Spanish Inquisition song, that was great. From then on, it's fantastic.Gregory Hines, Mel and everyone did a great job in this movie. Even though I said I didn't care for the Roman part of the film, Dom DeLuise did a very funny Caesar. Overall the music was great, the story was just a tad slow at the beginning but picks up by the end."
2,It seemed a lot funnier 25+ years ago...,"After more than 25 years of its theatrical release, I still had a faint memory of some good laughs.Well, maybe the problem is me (25+ years older), but it doesn't seem that funny anymore.If you are a teenager than there are some good laughs in it for you, but more mature crowd will probably dismiss it as rubbish.My wife slept halfway, but I somehow managed to go all the way to the END. 2 stars for old days sake..."
5,greatest comedy movie ever,"I have owned this movie for a while, watched it so many times, and I love it. This movie is probably the best comedy movie ever made. I highly recommend it."
5,great book,"Joan Aiken was my favorite childhood author, and I will neverreally have enough of her work, no matter how old I get! I lovethe Dido Twite series, so of course love this book!"
3,cute but too pricey,"I thought my granddaughter would enjoy it. But once the novelty of making his nose grow wore off, it was never played with. it's a very nice quality item, but I wouldn't shell out the bucks again. Unless your kid eats sleeps and breaths pinocchio I wouldn't waste my money."
5,what,why do you require sixteen or more words. I don't have time to write a long review on each item. you need to make things shorter. Five stars should be enough!!!!!!
4,a sweet tangy candy... It tastes great!,"I love smarties, and they taste really, really good! They almost look like a pill, and taste very sweet and tangy. They come in different flavors, including purple, orange, red, green, and pink. They're really good!"
5,Possibly Lee Hammond's best book,"Even if you own Lee Hammond's other drawing books, there is still a wealth of information to be gained from this one! The author provides clear instructions on a variety of topics -- from drawing stunning glass objects to producing the most technical architecture renderings -- it's all here, in the unique Hammond style.If I had to choose one drawing book to keep, out of my entire collection, it'd likely be this one. I'm thoroughly enjoying the reading of it and looking forward to practicing the many tutorials it offers.I give it a resounding A+.Jan(...)"
2,Smudging? really?,"I really like the set up for this book and there are some really interesting suggestions, BUT most art teachers abhorre the smudge and smear technique. Though the technique may make a beginner artist feel proud, know that higher level art teachers will not be okay with this technique and will not take you seriously.If you are buying this book for your own personal sketchbook and enjoyment than fine, but if you are trying to enhance your skills for an art class or something AVOID IT!"
4,Charly,"While the film is ""outdated"" in its photographic methods, the message about how we tend to deal with the mentally retarded still bears our attention. And of course Cliff is superb."
1,Awful!!!!,This movie is absolutely awful.I hope no one has to go through the terrible experience of watching it.The acting is bad and the book itself is boring.The movie doesn't follow it anyway.Those people at the oscars must have felt sorry for Cliff Robertson because he does an absolute horrific job.
3,Needed more examples,"I was hoping that this book would offer more examples of how to plan your acreage. There was one plan for each identified space. I also was looking for information on keeping horses out in a pasture but did not find any shelter projects. Since I live in Florida, I loved looking at the pictures of snow and lush green grass but it doesn't really exisit here- especially not the snow."
1,Horrible,"Player would not play any region 1 discs, picture was grainy and the remote is terrible. Proof that you get what you pay for,"
5,important early work,"i won't use alot of words. anyone who admires this important artist's work will appreciate these early tracks. yes, these tracks can be found on other compilations, but this is a good one. and no, they do not bare the signature heavy rhythm section that defines so much of his later music. the production is ""nashville-lite"" but you can just feel Waylon's art growing. he is a genuine mutation of rock, blues and country. and sometimes this polarity of styles push and pull against one another and that's exactly what makes this such an interesting american music document. Picasso once said, ""innovation is ugly"". deal with it."
1,eegah.......ugh!,"very campy movie, sound and special effects in todays standards less than basic. I seem to remember seeing this movie back in the 60's when I was at high school.Not at all what I envisaged."
2,Disgustingly cynical,"I found the level of cynicism in this book extremely repulsive. Weinberg consults for large organizations that apparently don't really want their problems to be solved or don't accept consultants' solutions, and he has therefore built an elaborate structure of ""wisdom"" around continuing to take their money and performing pointless services nevertheless. If you find yourself in his situation, you may enjoy this book. If not, read Alan Weiss's book Million Dollar Consulting instead, which offers advice for building a successful consulting practice around genuinely useful services."
5,The single best book about consulting on any topic,"I first read Weinberg's book, Secrets of Consulting, several years ago. It took me years to realize just how much I'd learned from it, although even at the time I would have told you it has the highest density of epiphanies-per-page I've encountered in any business book. His ""orange juice rule"" has helped me to do and say the RIGHT thing... wow, I couldn't even estimate how often.I've looked at a lot of consulting books. This is the one I keep coming back to."
3,Don't Blame Van!,"The songs on this album have indeed been released many times over, but don't blame Van Morrison for that! He has no ownership or control over these early tapes. If you want to hear what he thinks about that situation, listen to Big Time Operators on the album Too Long In Exile. For anyone who loves Van's music but doesn't know this early material, the best album to hear is The Bang Masters, and there are some great songs despite the ragged production."
3,not compatible with some programs!,"I read the reviews for this and after much comparison shopping, I decided this was the way to go. The only program that you can transfer songs to the mojo with is the Unifi program that comes with it. It does NOT work with Windows Media or Real Player, or the Moodlogic it comes with. Unifi kept freezing and causing me to reformat the mojo. I've had two different Mojos in the past week and experienced the same problem with both of them. TDK Support couldn't figure out the problem, so I figure it must be something on my system....not that I have anything weird on it.When I was able to get a few songs on it, at first they sounded great, then it started making this chirping sound every once in a while. I don't know what my problem has been with this thing, I really wish it would have worked for me."
1,Its a piece of junk,"This player is a piece of junk.First the USB really doesnt mean you can hot swap. You can access the files only if the software is installed on the computer which means that you cannot pick up MP3 from any computer.Second, it gives errors with XP. It tries to install drivers every time.THird, removing old and adding new MP3 is such a hassle. It takes minutes to delete old files and add new. Seems like you are working with a floppy.Fourth, its Mojo software hangs all the time.Fifth, it sucks battery life.Sixth, if your MP3 is not in a directory, i.e. if copied directly, it wont show. Then it wont delete and will show 200 MB as not free space. Formatting is the only way out.Seventh, it came with a mail in rebate which never showed up.Overall, a bad experience."
2,Live fast die young,"Looks nice, light, incredibly small, great features, unfortunately mine only lasted 6 days. Completely stopped working, fortunately J&R took it back with no hassle."
3,Kid's books,"This book was OK. I had seen another copy that motivated me to order this one, but it wasn't as good. The information is great for kids to read."
4,Pretty,"As with all Le Creuset products, this one looks great in my kitchen. But, truthfully, it's awfully expensive for what it is. You really have to set great store in its *looks* when you consider buying this set."
2,wonder boys cd,I purchased the wonder boys cd which was suppose to be brand new (not used) and when I received it and played it I found all the song titles on the cd cover did not match up in order with the songs being played. Also the names of each artist for each song was not listed at all. Which makes me think someone just burned this cd and hastily threw on song names where ever they wanted. I was really disapointed and feel like I've been cheated. Makes me not want to buy from Amazon ever again. Babs A
1,Scuba information=Weak!,Not much information here for planning dive trips.Just a bunch of fluffy information about fish and animal life.Pictures are so-so. MAYBE a coffee table book. But no way on a reasonable amount of useful dive information. Save your money!
2,"Great tracks, but they are all in mono on this CD!","This CD is a digital edit (a DJ mix assembled on a computer rather than a live mix set) of classic Todd Terry tracks from 1988, plus 3 tracks from 1994. The music is great, but there's just one major, major problem with this disc. The intro and segues are in stereo, but the tracks are all in mono! This is fine if you are blasting it at a party or on a crummy car audio system, but for any other kind of listening, it is terribly annoying.Since I have the original 12""s of a number of these tracks, I know that Todd Terry's music was in fact recorded in stereo. It is a crying shame that the dj who mixed the disc, Anthony Acid (an artist who released some mediocre dance tracks of his own back in the day), mastered all the tracks mono and left his segues in stereo. Was it intentional? I wonder..."
5,"In the 90's, I used to exercise with ""Dynamite Legs"" workout","In the 90's, I used to exercise with ""Dynamite Legs"" workout, and till this day, I am grateful to have worked out with this particular fitness instructor's video. I do wish that modern workouts are as thorough as this one. Immediately after implementing this workout into my routine, I had several people commenting that my legs look great, and the muscles on my legs being toned were mostly due to this workout. Good memories.I haven't used it for a while, because it is in VHS.This workout should be digitized into a movie file for future customers on iTunes."
2,"to much ""less"" for my taste!","I think that the book showcases work that would normaly place third in a design show. The idea of New Simplicity is simply a nice way of saying little color, little visual metaphore, little interest. If you are buying this book because you think that this is a swiss simplistic book DON'T! If you are buying this book because you think it's of the likes of Jan Tischold, or of the Bauhause regime, DON'T. This is a book that can add another inch to your design library, and give you a few ideas for how to make a few colors, and minimal design have some minimal impact."
2,bored out of my mind,"I cannot believe that anyone would be interested in fashion design, and yet not know how to sew a seam. This man has a wealth of information to share, but he did not give much on this set. There is really not one word about drawing clothing. I am under the impression he had planned to do more DVDs, but it has been several years since he did this set."
3,good...but not something that really inspired me.,Bob was not articulate at all. It was good. But not inspiring. I do not regret this purchase...but I definitely could have saved by you-tubing the info instead.
2,Two Stars ... In Deference to this Great Author,"I do love A.L. and most of her books, but this was not one of them. I couldn't wait to read it after reading the wonderful book BORDER LORD, about Malcolm's father, Duncan Kerr. THAT book was great, THIS book was awful. So boring, the plot was not interesting, and the characters were hard to get to know. I was SO disappointed, as I'd waited a while to get this one, too."
3,Decent R&B cd,"This cd is pretty good but could have been a lot better. The 2 really good songs on here are Don't Rush and All My Life. Other songs on here worth checking out are Last Night's Letter, Just For Your Love, and You Bring Me Up. It isn't great, but it IS worth getting, so check it out today!"
3,I know these people!,"There are people who will read Jeff Gomezs' work and wonder who on earth behaves in such a repulsive manor... And then there are people like me who wonder if Gomez went to the same college that I did. When put together with his previous work, ""Our Noise"", Gomez has carved a fairly realistic example of what life is for a lot of todays bored post-college/pre-stuffy generation (myself included)."
1,Make them all go away,"When you read a novel, it's helpful to find at least one character that is sympathetic with qualities that make the reader care about them. Don't look for such a character here. The characters are (a) shallow as a wading pool, (b) snakes in the grass, (c) complete jerks and/or (d) borderline retarded. Toss in plenty of stilted, unbelievable dialouge and mundane paragraphs setting or developing scenes and finishing this novel becomes a test of reading endurance. By the end -- if you make it -- you don't care what happens to anybody. How this set of characters ever warranted one book, much less two, is very difficult to believe or understand. Measures should be taken now to ensure these characters never surface again."
2,BE ADVISED!!,"These ARE NOT the original Cheetah Girls! Unfortunately, you won't realize this until AFTER you have purchased the cd. This bit of information is inside the cd case. I don't believe that my daughter is aware of this ruse because the girls on the cd sound pretty close to Raven and the others. BUT...if you want to hear the original singers, do not buy this cd."
4,Buy this! Not the cheetah girls soundtrack!,This is a great product. It's really fun and gives you a lot of enegery and makes you want to dance and sing. My only complaint was that they have all the same songs as the cheetah girls soundtrack plus the karoke.The cheetah girls soundtrack though only had the vocal version of all of the songs. The problem is they are both for the exact same price. I'll give this product 4 stars becuage great but not fabulous.
3,The Gospel of Judas,"Right away, I purchased The Gospel of Judas when it was first published by the National Gergraphic Society. After reading these many reviews, I am confused by this book by Pagels and King. Some of the reviews seem to have their own axe to grind. From my understanding, before I read The Gospel of Judas, I wrote that Judas gave the Peace Child to the enemy. An Analog from Adam to Nero. The Gospel confirmed, in my own mind, that my thoughts were correct. I continue to check and recheck the data in my publication. I do not know what liberty the authors have taken, but I would not disregard the contents of their opinion."
2,weak,"Instead of the Authors simply presenting this for what it is (an ancient document, with an unknown author, giving his 'take' on Christianity at the time), they try to create some controversy that isn't there. I call it the ""Davinci Code Effect"". The content of this document is as interesting as any, of the many, documents from the time. But I couldn't get past th authors trying to create some drama."
3,Not Sure It Was Applicable To My Needs,"The book was well written, but I was expecting it to be more of a text of ""The Gospel of Judas"" rather than the content contained. It just wasn't what I was looking for."
1,This book lacks a sense of unity and flow in thought,THe Ghost writer of this book would have done better to have sat down with the people of Toronto rather than have written it from sermon / video clips. This accounts lacks a sense of reality and doesn't reference people within the movement at the time. The author starts a chapter theme then bounces off into the bushes so to speak.
3,"Happy and gay, easy to listen to, and nothing else","Just a mediocre 70's fusion, as you can make sure with the samples. Seems like soundtracks for B-class films.Only for the collectors."
4,Sweet and Simple,"Being a Jason Isaacs affectionado, I could not pass it up. I'm glad I didn't. It's a sweet little romance about a Portuages women who vows never to love again after loosing her husband at see. Then in comes Jason,aka Charlie Beck who is a gambler and falls in love with the lady after hearing her sing. I'm quite curtain this is Jason's first Romantic-Comedy leading role and he pulled it off without a hitch. The other actors were just as wonderful, which is important to make a movie memorable."
3,not enough support,This is an attractive shoe but the support is not good - I had to put gel inserts into the toe area so that I had some level of comfort.
3,shoes,"I like the shoes, but they are a little tight, don't think the width is accurate, length is good. The wider width wasn't available in my size."
1,This book is an illegitimate claim of having flown in combat.,"This book deserves no stars. It is so full of inaccuracies that I question the author's claim to have been a combat pilot. Descriptions of terrain, routes flown, personal relationships are completely bogus. Ex: He states that the monsoon starts in November. Wrong! He got his personal equipment briefing just befoe he left on his first combat mission. It didn't work that way. He says the PDJ was named after a Frenchman named Jarres. Wrong. He was sent on his first mission totally unprepared? Not likely. I was a Skyraider pilot from the same base just before this author claims to have been there. This was written by someone who wants to be called a hero, but who wasn't."
1,A book of fiction,"While I enjoyed the authors description of the spooky guys who met his plane after his night landing in Long Tieng, it never happened.I worked/lived at Long Tieng from early 1970 until almost the end of the war in Laos. No C123 ever made a a night landing at Long Tieng in the 2 plus years that I was there. A query to others who lived there before me elicited no one who saw such a thing happen.Buy this book as fiction."
1,wooden,"Potentially good story turned into a stupid book full of inaccuracies, wooden dialogue and unlikely events. A waste of time. A real editor would have helped."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I bought this book because so little has been published on these kinds of operations in the Vietnam War, especially with C-123s. As a pilot, I like detail on actually flying the aircraft as much as, or more than personal reminiscences.The flying stories in this book are interesting, even riveting in places, although there's not a lot of detail about operating the aircraft. The cornerstone story about an emergency landing in the dark is graphically told, but is so remarkable, it's almost difficult to believe.I deeply respect the author's service to this country, and his gallantry. However, there are some aspects to this book of ""getting even"" with the USAF leadership and some of his colleagues, and maybe exorcising some subsequent nightmares. All quite understandable, but they diminish the appeal of the book for me."
5,A Must Read For Pilots,"If you are a pilot, you have to read this! The Author takes you in and has you sitting right there with him. It is exciting, true, and is a must read. AAAA +++++."
3,Mediocre--But Forgivable--Latin Verse,"Ausonius of Bordeaux was perhaps the greatest grammarian of the fourth-century. His admirable efforts as a poet, politician, father and schoolman, won him the lofty title of consul and fame that echoed to the ends of the Empire. As a poet, it would be safe to say that he fails to surpass his younger contemporary Claudian, although at times--for instance in his Moselle--Ausonius rises to Virgilan mastery. The poems preserved in these two volumes are various and diverse in their versification and style; and their contents are a more valuable source for history than for their merit as pure Latin verse. Nevertheless, occasional brilliance marks the elements of Ausonius' writings; his faults as a poet are to be dismissed due to the flaws of his age. This volume is a definite recommendation for students of the Later Roman Empire."
3,Amzing until.. the end.,"I did not find this puzzle to be difficult and finished it rather quickly. I was disappointed in the end when I realized the puzzle I received was defective. There were 500 pieces, but 2 of the pieces were the same, so I was missing a piece. Immediately returned. The quality of the pieces are good."
3,"Decent reference of chord sequences, but not for writing songs","I have to echo what a previous reviewer said: this is a book of making chord sequences, not for making songs. I suppose it has some value as a reference library of possible chord sequences, but I doubt if you will turn them into ""great songs"" -- unless of course you already know how to write great songs! The way I see it, chord sequences is the easiest part of songwriting - writing lyrics, finding the rhythm and coming up with great melodies and getting the right ""mood"" are all the more important, and more difficult, aspects. Of course, others may feel differently."
1,Songs are more than just chords...,"This book should be called ""How to turn chords into chord progressions"" because that's pretty much all there is. As a reference book it's pretty decent, but working through the whole book is a tedious process. Also there is no index in the back which makes it har do look up specific subjects.As a whole, this book promises more than it delivers."
5,Excellent,Excellent source of material to take your songs up a notch. The author provides clear examples. The book is extremely well organized.
5,Pick it up,"This makes for a good read, the kind of book you can pick up, open to any page, and find something worthwhile."
5,A very special book,Rec to anyone wanting to understand the true gift of giving or receiving flowers or growing a meaningful flower garden.
3,Party With the music of THE EL DORADOS,All I can say is the CD bring back memories. Good rich style and sound for the time of the 50s and 60s.
1,shes wrong,"she forgets to mention shesonq or jesus christ in her book and she lacks many things like kenneth kitchen findings about joseph being sold 20 pieces of silver matches the prices of slaves during that period, she would need to read jeffery shelers book is the bible true?"
5,"Reader from Silver Spring, MD","I just returned from a trip to the Middle East and picked up this book. I wish I had been able to read it before I left. I traveled to many of the sites it mentions, such as Jerusalem, the pyramids in Egypt and Mount Nebo in Jordan, but there was so much information in the book that the tour guides don't tell you. The most interesting part to me was the chapter about Egypt and the Exodus story. I had visited the pyramids, but had no idea that just a short distance away from where I was standing, archaeologists had uncovered an entire cemetery of graves of workers who built the pyramids. The information that archaeologists are providing about what the workers' lives were really like is different from the image that I had of what it must have been like building the pyramids. The book provides an additional history of the region - all the information not found in the guidebooks and travelogues!"
4,Elegant Iris Folding,"Iris folding makes a neat, semi-inexpensive way to make beautiful cards which will be keepsakes for receivers."
5,A thought provoking book,"I bought this book when I was on a trip to Alaska. It is a great story about prejudice toward the Alaskan natives, but could be applied to all races. Very thought provoking, as well as a great story. I think I read it in two days, couldn't put it down."
4,good travel read,"I picked this book up in Alaska, and found it so enjoyable I wanted to share it with others. It depicts what the early settlers faced and the harsh weather those in remote villages still contend with."
5,Tisha,"I've had this book for many years and I've re-read it many times and enjoy it each time. It is an amazing story of courage and love. I feel as if I'm in Alaska each time I read it. Currently, I'm reading Tisha for the 6th time."
5,Tisha an amazing read,Trully a real heroine. I great lesson in willpower and self reliance who overcame prejudice and extreme hardships with a spirit of unquenchable determination unlike so many today who expect a free handout.
2,Interestingly probative; woefully incomplete,"Let me first say that I enjoyed reading this book. It helped me better understand both music and neuroscience. Music's influence on us is a fascinating and powerful subject.That having been said, however, I do need to make at least one criticism. Levitin's evolutionary explanation for the development of music is egregiously one-sided. He suggests, with others, that music may be an outward demonstration of intelligence and physical prowess - look at me, I can afford to waste all this time and energy - akin to the male peacock's tail. THIS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD FOR MALES, BUT WHAT ABOUT FEMALES!? I read not one sentence in Levitin's book explaining what evolutionary theory would have to say about female singing. I'm willing to accept adaptive explanations for many things.. but in this case Levitin does little to ward off the inevitable criticism that his book features a number of very half-based ""just so"" stories."
5,"Excellent treatment for the musical and so-called ""non-musical"".","An excellent study of how the neurology of music is most important to being human. Music is an essential part of our evolution and Levitin makes an excellent case. His own fascinating biography makes the book even more interesting. It is well written, easy to read, but neither is it ""pop""-science. I bought a few for gifts to my musician friends and relatives."
5,Excellent informative read!,I really loved this book because unlike many books related to this subject it has not been too watered down. It is accessible but still contains loads of information. Somehow Levitin has managed to fit an 800 hundred page draft into a 200 page book! I will continue to refer to this book for a long time to come.
4,Plenty of detail,"The most striking feature of this book for me is that it blurs the line between music as an aesthetic experience & the study of the brain as a scientific exercise.So while it does a great job of defining the various parameters we appreciate music by ( notes, pitch, timbre, meter etc), it also delves into the way memory is organized in the brain, how musical appreciation is connected to our emotions, what makes a great anything (10, 000 hours of practice, apparently) etc.The chapter on memory is tiresome & is far too academic for general readership. The initial chapters on musical parameters is very helpful to somebody with no training on music. The connections to emotions, & the music we like are very interesting reads.Overall, a more than moderately good book without being exceptional because of the insufficient sieving out of unnecessary detail."
1,"I'm a music therapist, and feel let down.","To be brief, this book was based on an individual's point of view yet he attempts to portray it as fact. I read it, disliked it and returned it all in the same day. I won't write anymore because it's all been written before in these lower scoring reviews."
3,"Familiar concepts about music, and some dodgy theories","Does it help to know why you can't get the music of Pink Floyd or Mozart, Adele or Miles Davis out of your head? Levitin's theorizing makes the reader at least consider the effect of music on the human mind and its functions. While some of his conclusions may be up for discussion (the ""sound of a tree falling in the forest"" debate gets a surprising ""no"" answer -- so much for the laws of physics) many of his book's concepts are very familiar to the general reader: music, beginning with rhythm, has been a human component for a long time, and is intricately connected with many human activities. This book won't change the reader's listening habits, or even musical preferences -- but it should sharpen an awareness of the role music plays in our everyday lives."
3,A disappointment,"Perhaps there simply isn't enough information yet on this subject to justify a book for the general reader, but the author's lame prose style doesn't improve matters. He may be a good enough scientist not to give us suspicions and hunches, preferring to single out what is technically verifiable, but that makes for slim pickings at this point in neural science. This might have been a decent essay, focusing on the most interesting findings thus far, but the author stretches to provide frivolous anecdotes, often needless examples from pop and classical composers, and irrelevant autobiographical details. Pay heed to the detailed three-star reviews here, and vow (like the chastened reviewer I am now) never to buy a book based on a title (and chapter headings) that the author surely lacks the wit to create for himself. They represent a good job by some publisher of jazzing up a dull writer."
4,Attention music lovers,The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it might only appeal to readers who are curious about actual brain functions while listening to music as well as the simpler pure enjoyment of notes strung together in a pleasing way. Take a chance on it and just skip over the parts that go into too much depth - or read every word and be fascinated as I was. This makes a perfect gift. I got one for my son and one for my nephew.
3,i am not a musician,"and apparently this book is aimed at me, a member of the general public who, the author asserts, is an expert at listening to music, if not a musician. well, i am a biologist, so the neuroscience isn't new to me, and i have to say that i was hoping for deeper insights. in a nutshell, this would be a good book to browse at the library rather than to buy.though perhaps to non-scientists the book is more interesting. i actually bought it for my boyfriend who, like the author, spent his adolescent years jamming (while i was reading). according to him, the author is trying a bit too hard to show off his music-cool, and he while the book is interesting, tales of adventure of wildlife biologists like alan rabinowitz are much more so . so, we'll stick with the three stars = browse before you buy."
3,Jim DeCicco - music producer review,"As a music producer, i am exposed to a large community of artists and am able to see firsthand how music affects people very deeply, on a mental and physical level. i think the subject matter that this book focuses on delves into an emotional space that is yet to be fully quantified. if there is one thing that is certain, it's that our emotional connection to music we experience during the most meaningful moments of our lives will resonate for generations to come.Apple iPad MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)Jim DeCiccoexecutive producer & co-founderhollywood music in media awards"
2,Irritating,"I, too, found the endless name-dropping endlessly irritating. As to the rest - I leave it to the more knowledgeable among us. However, I do recommend reading ALL the reviews before reading the book."
4,Your Brain on Music,This was a fascinating book more so because I am a deafened adult. I had my memories when I lost all hearing in 1977. Experiences I've had since seem weird to me because I remember. Now I understand why. This is a very informative book from both the music lover and indifferent listener points of view.
4,VAPORTRANSMISSIONS,the best cd ever..well not as good as there debut but it is really good. I LOVE IT :)
1,CRAPOLA,"AAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! What a freaking piece of crap!!! Please people listen to real talent such as Dream Theater, Queensryche, Rush, Led Zeppelin. This is the worst album I have ever had the displeasure of purchasing. Leave this album on the shelves PLEASE."
3,Very lackluster,"Two great songs on it with a few ""eh"" songs on it. This whole CD sounds like the stuff that normal bands would put near the end of their CD where everyone just gets tired of listening to it after the hits."
4,14 bucks well spent...,"Orgy's got a fresh sound. Don't let ""Fiction (Dreams In Digital)"" throw you off purchasing this album. While it's a good song, it's very mellow compared to the rest of the album. I particularly like the way the tracks are arranged. First, it's got a cool cyberpunk intro. Second, it's got a few fast-paced tracks with harsh-sounding guitars and cool sound effects. Then, it slows things down a little bit with Fiction, and it picks the pace up a bit again. If you like groups like Nine Inch Nails (particularly Pretty Hate Machine), you'll have to give Orgy a try. I think you'll like it."
5,"Can we say ""Gods?""","Candyass was a breakthrough ablum, mixing sounds from different genres and eras to create a unique sound. Vapor Transmission shows them settling down- not in volume, but in thier style. This cd shows much more delicacy than candyass (the layering on fiction is astounding), yet has much heavier parts as well.This cd stands out from any other popular music on the market. It has a heavy sound associated with the new sound of rock, yet Jay actually SINGS. Eva, is a song written from the heart. It's musically delicious, but the lyrics hold meaning as well. It's been a long time since mainstream musicians approached music like that.This really shows the diversity that Orgy has. ""Odyssey"" sound very Korn-esque (in heaviness), while Eva could be Sting. They have been compared to David Bowie, and I think the judgement is fair. Thier talent is as great, and thier influences as broad.I certainly recommend this cd to anyone!"
3,Very Lackluster,"Big beats kick off this album after the lackluster introductory track. Two great songs on it, which are Fiction (Dreams in Digital) and Opticon. There are a few ""eh"" songs on it. This whole CD sounds like the stuff that normal bands would put near the end of their CD where everyone just gets tired of listening to it after the hits. Other notable tracks are the Odyssey which is a fast paced ride through the band&#65533;s warped visions of high school. Eva which totally slows the pace with a guitar melody, solid drum beats and great vocals. Eva would make a great song to back a movie or real life. Eyes-Lies-Radio, is a boucing, peppy beat which is somewhat popish and unlike Orgy. Saving Faces is totally from a video game with its technological sound scape backing the vocals. If you are looking for something unique and will take you on a voyage to a different futuristic world, this CD is for you."
4,cool sun glasses,Sit kinda funny on face.get them custom adjusted and it's fine.gradient lens is barely noticiable when they are on.
4,Not The Worst....,"I'm not a fan of Colin Baker as the Doctor, but any story with Daleks in it is alright in my book. It was really creepy seeing people become Daleks. And I've always been a fan of the white Daleks, who really came into their own in the story Remembrance of The Daleks. I'd check that one out first, though."
1,"pretentious, cutesy drivel","It's been about twenty years since I put a book down without finishing it. I'm obsessed with finding out how things turn out, even if I find I can't stand the writing. I put this book down, happily. Actually, the ease with which the book can be tossed is the best thing about it. I can just imagine the writer tittering at her deliciously wicked bon mots. The prose is agony, the characters are lifeless, the clever chapter titles are pretentious, fake and forced. After forcing a few chapters down my gullet, with a plot nowehere in site, I put this one down. If I had a paper shredder, it would go in the cat's litter box."
5,Writing is like art,"I loved this book. I had been told by a friend I would either love it or hate it, and to me, it was remarkable. I'm well-read, but there were words here I was unfamiliar with (how lovely!), and I just reveled in how the sentences were winding together towards the climax, which admittedly took me completely by surprise. I can't wait for another book by her -- I immediately looked for ANYTHING else she had written, but apparently I'm going to have to wait!"
1,Pretentious elitist ill-conceived P.O.S.,"I won't list the reasons why I hated this thing. Not because the reasons aren't good, but because I feel like I already wasted too much time out of my life reading it. If you want to know what the book is like, just look for the most useful reviews, both the most useful favorable review and the most useful critical review, they absolutely nail the problems with this book, so I don't see why I should write a redundant critique. (Note: when the most useful favorable review is very critical, and the most useful critical review totally trashes your book, I'd say you have a problem)I'm noting down everyone who gave this P.O.S. five stars so in the future I can stay clear of any other books they like!"
4,"Creative, intriguing, & just plain fun (in most places)","What more can I add to the many positive reviews this book has received. I picked it up out of curiousity not intending to really read it -- it pulled me in and then I was stuck weeding my way through the funny, the mundane, the serious, and the confusing. At times all the ""citations"" drove me crazy and I skipped over only to sometimes back track and then burst out laughing.The book totally held my interest until approximately the last 75-100 pages when the unraveling of the mystery begins to take place. At that point I felt like I was walking in deep snow. (thus the four stars rather than five).This book certainly isn't War and Peace, but it is clever and just fun to read. A great effort! (But, I wouldn't recommend the author attempting this style again--like a clever joke -- funny the first time, not so the second)."
4,Hang in there (and pay attention),"Yes, the first half of this book can feel like very slow going, but Pessl is putting a lot of things in place -- if you skim through or skip pages, you will miss out. By the time I got to the last third of the book, I had trouble putting it down. I thought the ending was quite satisfying -- if you've read carefully, everything comes together very nicely; in fact, you will understand things that Blue herself is overlooking (or refusing to let herself see). This is not light reading, but I thought it ended up being well worth the effort."
3,"Good story, overly verbose","I had trouble deciding how to rate this one. On one hand I liked the underlying story, but on the other hand it was hard to get to the story through all of the overbearing literary allusions, metaphors on top of metaphors, and just plain wordiness.I felt like Pessl was trying too hard to write a ""literary"" novel and in doing so just came off as overly pretentious. I prefer to read fiction with literary value, but this book tried too hard and in doing so did not succeed.I think Pessl has some potential because the underlying story was quite good. I liked the illustrations and while the beginning of the book dragged on and on to the point that I almost quit reading, it speeds up considerably by the end. Basically, it is a 300 page story trapped in 500+ pages. I'm hoping Pessl will have a better editor for her next book."
1,oh please!!,If this is a brilliant debut then what else these publishers are looking at must be really abysmal! The characters are cartoons....the writing is glib and I just kept thinking...who cares? I am just stunned by the positive reviews and the hype and I loved Secret History by Donna Tartt. If there were minus stars I'd give it one.
2,Too much buzz,"This book is seriously overrated. Yes, Blue is a brilliant oddball. Her father is curiously distant at times and the professor we all wish we'd had at others. But in the end, this is not a new story, and much of the quirkiness ends up being far too cute. The relentless citations become absurd. Pessl has created some wonderful characters and overdone them in this novel. The tension between the characters and the unique form (the chapter titles, the final exam, and the movement between a regular high school pack and Blue's mind) in which she has chosen to write, ends up obscuring what is good about the book. It needed to be one or the other. These characters and their plot, combined with its clever form, create a book that outweighs its parts."
4,Quirky Fun,"This book was fun and quirky. It cites various books, movies and plays throughout in order to show the protagonist's mindset and if one is well read (or watched) it makes it a fun adventure...like sharing a secret. There are also some quirky little linguistic things that she does (I won't give it away) that made me smile and relate as a writer to her tactics.I bought the book for a book club read and ended up reading it really for me.Quite enjoyable!~stormy"
2,like viewing a car accident,"I really slipped up on this one - and let the gimmicks of the cover and a quick scan entice me into buying it. It's clearly packaged as a clever, humorous and pretentious mystery.I'm now on page 233, about halfway through the book, and am hooked on two-dimensional characters, unconvincing literary allusions and overstretched metaphors. I've been unable to tear my eyes away from the gory technique splattered across each page.But this isn't healthy so for the sake of my remaining karma I'm going to put it down. Can't recommend it unless you either have karma to burn or like your metaphors and allusions cheap & plentiful - like the steaks at the $4.99 All You Can Eat."
3,Details to distraction,The author made a short story long. Tedious and distracting details slow the reader's flow. I was worn out by the time I reached the 2/3 point in the book and the ending suggests that the author shared my weariness.Paladin
4,Very entertaining,"Enjoyed this book, was a work involving many interesting characters and was an entertaining yet thoughtful book. I really enjoy her writing style- nice to read a book by someone who has a knowledge of the English language. Will be passing this book on to my daughter and recommending it to her."
5,Ends with a bang,"Damn good read. This is interestingly plotted with a little too much Donna Tart influence, but still a load of fun to read. Can't wait for her next!"
2,yikes...,"Too many tangents relating to literature the average folk has not read. Plot kept me going but this book is so overwritten. I couldn't recommend this to a friend. It was agonizing to get to the meat of this story. Unless you've majored in world literature, the countless sources of literature referencing the story gets so old. I kept fighting the urge to read the last chapter to get it over with. I love a good book, this was not it."
1,Thoroughly Distracting writing style,"I ""think"" I would have loved the story had I not been driven to total distraction by the writing style with the embedded footnotes, rambling sentences and strange references that seemed often not even pertinent. It took me 3 trys to make it far enough in the story to catch my attention. Even then, I carried it with me only to appointments or lunch where I had nothing else available to read. I stuck with it, trying to ignore many sections that didn't seem worthwhile. I found myself caught up in it finally by the middle, only to be disappointed by the totally annoying ending. I wanted a good, solid read, and it was a potentially great story wrapped in distracting writing style. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, it's going in the discard pile.."
2,Barely Worked,This post is just for historical purposes as I can't believe anyone will be purchasing the 6700 ever again. This door barely held on. I ended up having to use duct tape. Really embarrasing :(
3,Deeply Optimistic.,"This book can touch someone on all levels. It consists of inspirational, humorous, and yes naive lectures the author gave from 1970-81. I found the two most important chapters to be, ""Thats Where The Light Is, and Choose Life."" The former gives insights to the importance of living in the present and shows that we need not fear death, if we have lived. The latter details some sorry statistics about our society and how we as individuals can choose to make our lives better. The brief story of the leopard shows the positive aspect of passion. A good upbeat book that can raise ones spirits."
1,No content whatsoever!,"All the ""life advice"" in there could be summarized in about one sentence : ""get a grip, this is your life, so do something with it that makes you happy and stop blaming everything or everyone else"".That's it! that's where the content stops. Wow, what an aboslute no-brainer. I actually flicked through the second half early on to make sure I was not missing something. No. Just empty pep talks all over. I could not believe it, not after the raving reviews the book gets, but there it is.Stating the obvious,starting with his own experience, on and on. Plus, this book is full of repetitions (of Buscaglia's childhood anecdotes mainly), because it's a collection of his speeches, making it even more boring (if that's possible)."
5,one of the best kids books in a long time,"""Dogzilla"" is hillarious to say the least. We discovered this book quite by accident while waiting for an appointment. We read this book five times before our name was called and laughed until the tears were streaming down our cheeks. I had to write down the information before leaving because we had to get our own copy. Well thanks to grandparents and amazon we've laughed our way through this book several more times. Even sent it to school with my four year old to share with his class and they laughed their way through it too. well worth the money as it will quickly become a treasured favorite for the whole family. most definitely five stars."
3,right-handed only,"These turned out to be useless for us, because my son is left-handed. This means that the fork and spoon point the wrong way for him. Most babies are fairly ambidextrous, so it's not an issue for most parents, but if your kid shows a pronounced tendency for left-handedness, these utensils will only frustrate them.Aside from that, though, these are still only mediocre. The handles are too thick for my 1-year-old son to grab, but the gap in the middle of the handle is too small for his fingers. Even as a toy, these aren't very good.Also, the color change takes 30 seconds, which is a lifetime when your irate toddler is begging for food, and only kicks in at 105F, which is way, way too hot. Just stick your finger in the food to see if it's a good temperature. It's faster, easier, and more informative."
2,Warning: Objects are smaller than they appear!,"The description gives you dimenstions of the teapot are fairly accurate, but in reality the thing is tiny! This is a teapot for one person only! It holds about two small cups of tea or hot water, which tend to go cold rather quickly.That said, it is pretty adorable and makes a great gift for a tea lover with a small bladder!"
5,Had a great influence on me,"I discuss this book on Episode 7 of the Real Time Decisions Webcast if you want to hear some of my thoughts (search for it on the Web or iTunes). In short, this book helped me to become more comfortable with my role as a technical leader, understanding that the informal aspects of leadership are as important as the formal, or more so."
5,This is the one,"Twenty years ago the print edition of this book allowed me to move from the middle to the senior ranks of my profession.The book is easy to read, and full of conversational, accessible stories that clearly illustrate the important material.The book is also demanding -- if you're serious about learning how to lead. It isn't an easy transition to make, and thisbook gives you more tools than I've found anywhere else but in a personal mentor. It's one of the cheapest sawbucksyou'll ever spend."
2,"Book contents awesome, but Kindle edition has NO ToC","I wish Amazon wouldn't lump reviews for all forms of books together. This book is a classic which I'm reading for a third time, and wanted to convenience of reading it in Kindle form. But there is no Table of Contents! I've encountered this situation for free Kindle books and figured you get what you paid for, but this book isn't free. Stick with the print version until Amazon does the right thing. I'll happily change my review once a Table of Contents is provided."
4,Fun series to read,"What a fun series! My only issue was that the editing wasn't very good. Words spelled incorrectly, or broken up with spaces, periods, or dashes. Other than that, I was pleased with the ending and how things wrapped up. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough!"
5,Storage box review,Excellent product for organizing your workbench. Heavy duty storage box that shows contents of all compartments. Fairly sturdy and should last a long time with care. Recommend this product for your organization of several small items that can be viewed at one time.
3,Stanley Storage Compartment,"Product is what I expected and the same one that I bought at Menard's for half the price. Unfortunetly, Menards doesn't carry this model any more and I needed these three to complete a cabinet of them in my wood shop.PT"
5,i could not believe it clean my shower that fast,"I live outside of town with iron in the water. Every 6 months or so we have to scrub and scrub our shower with abrasive cleaners, which takes about 6 hours start to finish. I used super iron out and it only took me about an hour. I made a paste with the cleaner and water and wiped it all over the walls and floor. I came back in 10 minutes and it was already turning white in some places. I gave it about 15 more minutes and re applied the ""paste"" to the walls and floor with a sponge and wiped it down again. I rinsed it of and i was done. There were a few spots I had to use some elbow grease, but way easier than before. (my porcelin bath tube and toilet took longer to do, about an hour longer, but it worked as well) Would recc. this if you have a lot of iron in the water. As a side note, I was suprised as a consumer that a product called Iron Out actually worked."
3,A self help book by Willie?,"I first picked up this book browsing in a real life book store several years ago. Opening it at random, this piece of wisdom jumped out at me: Don't be dazzled by your own bull shit. After quoting this phrase to myself and others over the years I finally bought the book. Folksy and funny and wise, and, it's from Willie."
2,Hi Willie..,"basically an old man's mussings. you can get this talking to an old fart at the vfw, post office, bar or hanging out in the garage. Love Willie but sometimes things go the way they go and being as positive as you can is the way to get through it but things don't always turn out so rosy. especially those who's talent is just being able to go to work everyday. they don't like it but they do it anyway. They don't have a talent that is going to rake in millions. No audiences, no applause, kids hate them, spouse is indifferent, etc. you know the backbone of the country."
5,A Definite Christmas Classic,"Linda Eder shows again why she is the most exciting singer of the past decade. I bought this disc back in October and it has constantly been played ever since. Her renditions of classics like ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, ""What Child Is This"" and ""Do You Hear What I Hear"" are warm and heartfelt. But it is the three new songs that delight the most. The title track ""Christmas Stays The Same"" is fantastic, sure to be a holiday favorite. Her dedication to her son ""Christmas Through a Child's Eyes"" is a simple, sweet moment. The last track though is the best. ""The Bell's of St Paul"" sung in her warm, strong, emotional style is a definite showstopper. This disc will be a favorite of Christmas's for years to come."
5,Christmas Stays the Same,What's not to love about this cd...an absolutely amazing voice singing the most beautiful Christmas songs.
4,Christmas doesn't stay the same - it gets better.,One of the best Christmas albums in recent memory (which is saying quite a bit). Linda delivers aided by some truly great arrangements (a standout is Kim Scharnberg's arrangement of 'Here comes Santa Clause' - WOW!). Give your ears a present this season and pick this CD up...
4,"Enjoyable, enlightening, thoroughly researched.","I'd have given this book 4 1/2 stars given the option. The only reason I didn't give it 5 is that it gets somewhat dry towards the end, but I blame my attention span for some of that. It's full of fascinating stories, tidbits and opinions from musicians, producers, friends and agents who worked with Ella. You'll come away from the book with a new understanding of Ella the person and Ella the musician. You'll learn much about the times and the musicians who created the story of popular music and jazz in America. You'll also have a fascinating guide to her recorded music, the whys and the hows of it, the circumstances that made it wonderful or less than great. I recommend this book!"
5,Prestige Aneroid Sphygmomanometer with Matching Royal Blue Carrying Case,I received this item before my expected date and time. I purchased it for my wife as she is taking up practical nursing. She loves it! I will recommend this item to my friends if they're looking for an affordable and yet so elegant one.
1,Did not last,"This item seemed like a good buy and worked fine at first. However, 1-1/2 years later, the rubber hoses and pump bladder have become brittle and leak. The unit is no longer usable. Poor materials have made this a DO NOT BUY recommendation from me."
1,"I bought this in late 2009, and its junk",The tubing crumbled to dust and there is air leaks everywhere.. The cuff won't even inflate. In 2 short years it was a compete loss.
2,Only If It Looked As Good As the Picture,"Overall, I rate this 2.75 Stars. I don't hate it, I don't love it, and after it's all said and done, I won't be keeping it. The picture on Amazon makes this piece look more substantial and much nicer than what it is. When I received mine, I was disappointed at the quality as this thing is not nearly as thick as it looks in the picture. In fact, it's bordering looking on the cheap side (I suppose for the price, I shouldn't be surprised). Due to this, it is probably not going to make the cut for it to be displayed in my kitchen so I will be re-gifting it. I do have to chuckle (and agree) at other reviewers comments on the shape of the spoon rest."
3,Stainless spoonrest,Spoonrest is okay. A little flimsier than I expected. Does wash beautifully in the dishwasher.
1,An utter disapointment,"I found this book to be dismal. I recieved it as a gift, but I found the advice to be narrow...perhaps ""Making the best of Harvard"" would have been a better title. The opinions stated are fully based on research there, and allow no room for other teaching/housing/living styles."
2,"Disappointing, but depends on frame of reference.","I had recently bought Fatboy Slim's On The Floor at the Boutique. That really was a fantastic album, and I keep coming back to it. I wanted to hear more of the series (and 'The Boutique' is a large series), and made this my second selection.I was pretty disappointed. Where Fatboy Slim had a lethal plate of beats and 303's, this album has a lot of remixed old hip-hop songs (Jungle Brothers and Blackstreet). This isn't really bad in and of itself, but it detracts from the main theme of the record: Big Beat. It is, afterall, the Big Beat Boutique, isn't it?So, that having been said, I liked the blackstreet remix. I even liked the Jungle Brothers remix. But I find that I feel ""strange"" listening to an album that preaches on and on about ""blackness,"" as a white person. Perhaps if the All Stars had focused on the music instead of skin color, the album would have seemed brighter and a little more coherent.Buy used, if at all."
1,Cool idea ruined by attempt to integrate 3D first person,"The premise is great: build a dungeon, raise an army of evil minions and kill the heroes. The execution even starts out well, but it all falls apart in 3D first person. Trying to lead your forces from this horribly-designed game mode fails completely. Too bad it wasn't optional. This game comes from an era where 3D first person was still something of a novelty, so, at the time it may have been excusable, but now, it's virtually unplayable."
5,INCREIBLE,Este es uno de los mejores sistemas de karaoke que existen. El chip de las canciones en español es bastante completo. Les aseguro que se divertirán bastante si lo compran.
1,not worth it,My cat loves catnip so i thought this would be perfect. She has no interest in it and neither do any of the neighborhood cats...i Swear its not catnip or something. If you go buy the catnip plant at petsmart it is wayyyy better
2,Absolutely Boring,"I have been in the ballet world for over twenty years, and this is absolutely the worst tape I have ever purchased. If your are interested in seeing a good New York City nallet tape, then you should check out the Prodigal Son with Mikhail Baryshnikov. Please don't waste your money on this tape."
5,Airships,"Dr. Eckener's Dream machine is a very well written account of Dr. Eckener and his airship, the Graf Zeppelin."
2,Why Mess With a Good Thing?,"This can opener is nowhere near as good as the model it replaced. The old space saver opener was woderfully designed and engineered. Why companies can't stick with a quality product, I'll never know. I can just see some new Black and Decker employees sitting around a conference table or in a design studio dreaming about getting that big bonus for designing something ""new."" It's a condition all organizations are afflicted with from time to time (it's probably happened to Amazon, too). They can't resist the idea that ""change"" is better than ""good."" For what it's worth, I'd like to see someone at Black and Decker put on their ""rational"" hat and re-issue old, great can opener. I'd buy one."
3,Automatic function isn't very automatic,I was able to install the can opener fine but my wife wasn't able to use the automatic function...no problem since we bought manual can opener at the same time.
1,Waste of money - AVOID,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer,this opener has no power and even sounds like it's agonizing over the chore of opening the lid. It is definitely hard to get a can started since the cutting edge will not lift up enough to be able to hook the can edge into it, and forget about even trying to see the blade while doing said placement!After only a week's use, it stalled numerous times while trying to open a large tuna can size. The can gets jammed and the motor continues to whine, and it took herculean effort to get the can back out of its grip. I had to unplug it several times to keep it from burning out its motor while I tried to free the can.I cannot believe the poor design and jamming problems from the B & D namesake, much less the highly touted Spacemaker line of appliances over the years. It's definitely back to a Proctor Silex like I had before and this piece of junk is outta here!"
3,Change for change sake is not always good,"I bought this to replace an older model of the same B & D device. I was disappointed to find they had needlessly changed the mounting hole alignment which meant you had to start over by drilling additional holes when you should have been able to simply install in existing holes.Other than that, function is fine."
4,Works perfectly but not easy to install,"Smooth as silk operation and no unusual noise. But heed the warnings in other reviews about difficulty mounting it. If the bottom of the cabinet is not flush with the front of the cabinet or the bottom of the cabinet is not within 3/8"" of the front trim, forget it. There aren't enough spacers for the back. While the spacers are made for all 4 bolts, they will be probably be needed only for the rear ones and will require easily snipping off the front ones. The unit must be mounted flush with the front of the cabinet to operate. That means two mounting bolts will go through the thickness of the cabinet's front lower lip and not through the floor. The rear two will go through the floor. Recessing it back prevents the handle from operating and from being removed for cleaning so forget that idea. It was worth the effort."
4,Could be a little easier to use,"Like all of the units in the Spacemaker series, this was a snap to install.I have never had time getting the can opener to open something. That said, it is sometimes a little trying to get the can lined up properly."
1,Didn't even finish this book,"I read his first book ""The Dossier"" and didn't think much of that book, but was hoping this one would be better. I decided to not even finish the book, the writing just wasn't that great and the story line wasn't interesting.I wouldn't recommend it."
1,SAME PROBLEM??! REALLY??!,They sent me the bus bars without the covers too! WTH? How can a real business possibly make the same mistake TWICE?!!
3,Good Case - but not great fit for ES-335,"This is a well made case (maybe a little thicker then it needs to be)The interior compartment lid was not as great a fit as it could have been,but for the money you will not find a better made case.The problem I had was it was my old gibson 335 fit very loose in it.I am sure it would be protected fine - but I wanted something more custom.I called Gator about this and they said it use fit tight, but then loosened the specs to make it a more general case and fit a wider range of guitars.That's cool - but then don't call it a 335 case - just call it a slim hollow body case.I paid a little more and got SKB 335 case and it fits better and is not as bulky."
4,mod and vintage all at once,"even before i read the official revue of this cd, i was getting the impression while listening that somehow someone had went back to the 30s or so and had timewarped some musicians from that era here, and was using our technology to put down their sounds on record, with a few twists... and then the manhattan's came in and laid down their great vocals. after the millionth recording of a standard, it's nice to hear them done in a different yet reverent style. worth the listen!"
5,Fabulous!,"This CD is certainly a departure from the MT's previous work, but their risk taking pays off. The arrangements are quite different than anything Armstrong ever recorded, and as such it keeps the material alive and innovative. Considering Armstrong was one of the most important and innovative musicians of the 20th century, he would probably appreciate this artistic approach to his work. But most importantly, the vocalists have never sounded better. They have put together a Vocalese for the new century. Don't be scared off by negative reviews - there is plenty on the album for both dedicated and new fans."
2,Sadly disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Manhattan Transfer, and was delighted to hear that they were putting out a new CD. But, I just don't know what to make of this one. What is it? Maybe technically and artistically it's a cut above; but it's not pleasing, entertaining, and has no ""listen-ability"" factor. In truth, if you're a fan of MT and have numerous of their CD's; this one will be regulated to the bottom of the stack gathering dust. (Sorry to say). I still love 'em. Thanks for the try. You're still THE BEST. This one's not a winner though. (I would have given it 3 stars -- but wanted to offset the obvious ""promotional"" reviews)."
2,Shocked and dismayed!,"No where in the discription of this audio version of the finest books ever written, did it say ""this is a recording of a radio program""! It is a really good radio program and I have nothing against that...however I wanted an unabridged reading! It is done in 13 episodes, and they skip great parts of the text! I am greatly disappointed and would advise rabid fans of the books to avoid purchasing it. A casual fan or someone who had never read the books would enjoy it very much. It has incredible voices, singing and poetry. There is certain to be increased interest in the series because of the movies coming out in December 2001. Just know this set of CD's for what it is, an abridged interpretation done with many different voices."
5,wonderfully entertaining!,"for years i have been in love with this bbc version of the lord of the rings. my audio cassettes have been played and played to the point that several no longer work properly. finding this set on cd was the highlight of my week. if you are one of us tolkien crazy devotees, you should add this to your collection. it is well worth the money. i especially enjoy this on long road trips. ian holm (who played bilbo in the new line cinema movies) makes for a wonderful frodo. the other bbc regulars also offer very enjoyable performances."
1,Horrendous Piece of Work,"This was most definately the worst thing I have ever purchased in my life. First of all when buying it understand that it is abridged,(not the actual words of the book). Second it is a dramatization and lightly follows the storyline and misses many key plots. The voices are mechanical and don't fit the characters at all. Sometimes during playback the voices sound far away. I tried it on different CD players and it all sounded the same. I have been under the understanding that the BBC created quality dramatizations, but this was as I said, horrendous. If you want to actually be entertained buy the UNABRIDGED version narrated by Rob Ingles. They are more expensive but they will be worth your money."
4,Simply Amazing,"I recently purchased this BBC Dramatization and listened to all thirteen CDs in less than a week. I was blown away by it. The acting is incredible and many of the actors characterizations are very different from the one is the movies. I always love to see how someone else interoperates a role. The score and sound effects were also very well done, bringing the listener into the world of the play quite affectively. The narration when there was any was generally good however this is where a very small drawback lies. The battle for Helms Deep would have benefited from some more narration and was therefore somewhat lacking. In all though the production values on this radio dramatization are fantastic and I definitely recommend it to all fans of both the book(s) and movies. One important point to make is that this is a radio dramatization and not an unabridged, or abridged for that matter, reading of the book."
5,Praise it with great praise,"The BBC keeps radio drama alive. This adaptation of British classic ""The Lord of the Rings"" is perfect. The actors are all spot-on, and each of them is a skilled voice actor. Peter Woodthorpe, who plays Gollum, also does the voice of Gollum for the Ralph Bakshi animated version.If you have never listened to a radio drama before, you are in for a treat. The story is treated with respect and reverence. Minor changes are made in the adaptation, but nothing that disturbs the overall story. The entire production rings in at 13 hours.For a fantasy story, this is probably the best way to experience a story after the original books. The imagery and adventure still take place in your mind. The characters will look like ""your"" characters. Give it a try!"
2,SEVERE formatting problem with kindle version,"Does the content provider not read its own books???I use kindle apps both on my windows desktop and on my android tablet.Both show that this book has some serious formatting problems: things don't line up, certain words fail to display, bad spacing, and etc.This is a shame since the book seems good. 1 star for kindle version of the book, 4 star for the book's content."
3,Good value,"It doesn't sound great, but the nice compact design is really a plus. Easy to use remote control. Reads MP3 CDs very well, but no Ipod deck. I am happy enough to recommend for people who don't expect a powerful and very clear sound system."
4,drowning dreams,"Before climate change there was radiation and fears of the nuclear, but in this 1962 novel the seas have risen just the same and the remaining cities of the old world, flooded, supra heated, abandoned, reverting back to the prehistoric are all that remains.As much a novel of the psychological reversion as it is to do with any plot or great events, this is a strange but compelling kind of science-fiction. It is one of Ballard's earliest work and his language is ornate and his love of the extravagant simile here in abundance."
1,Boring,"I will make a recommendation on my course evaluation to have this book removed. It has got to be the most boring, repetitive, padded text I have had the misfortune to use in many years!"
3,Hype without color!,"Material is relavant, however, the layout and overall look of the book not so great. I expected more colors and a better layout. It looks as if a undergrad printed it from a home computer in black & white and bounded the pages. Had a difficult time staying iterested. The authors rambled. Again, the information was on course."
3,just get fight test,"hardly worth buying since you can get the remix on fight test now, but the japanese version is kinda funny to listen to once or twice. glad i have it for my collection, but not for the casual lips fan."
5,Great Book,"This book was in very good condition, and it arrived in a timely manner. I am very happy with this purchase."
3,"Good story, wished it had been better","Bottom Line: Try before you buyThis is a unique story...excellent foundation and explanation of the world. And interesting idea..It just didn't 'WOW' me. I struggled reading it. I did like the book's cover, however. If only the story matched or exceeded the alluring cover.Follows three characters...through a series of issues, with two of them uniting together in the story.. And I didn't connect, as a reader, to one of the main characters, Sebastian. He wasn't written as a guy I had to get to know, or know what happened to him. He wasn't a page turner.I will not buy the next in the series.I'd recommend for strictly fantasy with lots of weird creatures, Rob Thurman.And for fantasy with sex, Keri Arthur (Riley series), or Kim Harrison."
3,what happened?,"What happened to the Anne Bishop we know and love? _Sebastian_ is both a little too gooey and a little too po-mo. Post-modern (po-mo) stuff is all great and fine in novels when it's done well, but the ""symbolism"" of this book combined with Bishop's refusal to make her ""dark"" characters actually dark result in just a sappy love story with social constructivist overtones. Okay, I get that how we see the world affects our experiences in the world, and actually, I agree. But with such an intriguing set up I was hoping for a bit more edginess.Okay, I'm being too harsh. I did finish the thing, will probably buy the next one, and I did enjoy reading it. I think it was the ""romance"" that got to me."
2,Could Be Great...,"I registered for this bottle bag because of the positive reviews on other sites. I could fit 2 8 oz bottles and maybe a pouch of baby food inside. It really kept everything cold- the best I've seen so far. The problem is the zipper pull broke off after about 1 month, then the entire zipper broke off after 1 1/2 months of use. Very disappointing and annoying, especially because it's not a cheap bag."
1,Zipper broke on the first day!,"I purchased this bag from a brick & mortar store before reading the reviews. As mentioned in other reviews, the zipper on mine was severely defective! (The tab broke off on the very first day, and the zipper itself detached altogether within a few days later.)It's a shame, because I otherwise really loved the form factor of this bag. It was light, small, and could fit a couple of bottles with room on the outer pockets for two diapers and some wipes. However, given the manufacturing problems, I would not recommend this product."
4,Classic Carlin,"This is a rather underrated and obscure edition to Carlin's catalogue, but it's a great one. It's really just a lot of logic that packs some good laughs. More focus on observations and commentary than straight ahead comedy, but it's much funnier than some of his goofy stuff. It's actually a lot like his 90's material only more laid back."
3,A paradox- inventive and predictable all at once,"Madison Avenue is a kind of How To Succeed In Business... for the contemporary off- broadway set. It's premise is cute if a bit shtick-y: an advertising firm manages an account for ""Leonard's Lemonade"", a lemonade which eventually is found to work better as a floor wax. The songs are hummable, if cliched. A few songs succeed in being witty, such as ""The Look"", in which a makeover is given, step by step. Also, ""Leonardo's Lemonada"", where the entire cast creatively comes up with marketing jingles, from a Hispanic salsa- type number to a traditional Jewish hora. While it elicits chuckles, this CD is neither fresh enough to compete with similar contemporary musicals nor classic enough to appeal to that set. However, it's perfectly listenable, and a few numbers have tremendous potential, out of context, for competition, auditions, and such."
4,"Massage table case, bad smell","This case fits my table perfectly, and makes carrying it a breeze. It functions as it should. The only problem, is they must spray for bugs when the import fabric, as the thing stinks like chemicals. I have sprayed it with several fabric sprays, that supposedly remove odor, but, some of the odor still remains. If the product could be sold without the smell, it would be 5 star for sure."
1,"Cheap construction, dim light","Although this light looks like it is constructed of metal in the picture, it is NOT. The arms, hinges, base, shade, etc. are all plastic. The arm is very flimsy and I cannot believe it will last long. Also, the compact flourescent bulb is way too dim for a desk light. Keep looking..."
3,It sheds like a real bear =(,"Relative to other black bears found on Amazon I would say that it is one of the more cuter ones. Upon receiving the bear it would be wrapped in a air tight bag. The bear is quite soft and it has beads in it's feet and butt. The beads enable it to either stand on it's legs or sit upright. However, like the title says, it sheds like a real bear without much effort. If there was an option to give zero or negative stars I would with regards to durability. Unfortunately, it seems that I am the first to review this product. I wish I was forewarned."
1,Still don't have it a month later!!!,"Brookstone's customer service stinks!! Can't get a straight answer out of anyone, and still don't have my table after a month of calls and correspondence!!"
3,The Wheels Start to Come Off,"Although I never caught OZ when it originally aired, I have been watching it on DVD and I'm a big fan of the series. Although parts of Season 4 were great, I generally found the season was marred by some ridiculous plots, namely the ""instant aging pill"" storyline, as well as the unbelievable housing of chinese refugees in Emerald City. What were the writers thinking?"
5,A True Classic,"I have owned the original CD given to me by Word Perfect in 1993. I was blown away by the music then-- and now nearly 10 years later. I was also there when Kurt made his appearance and played for a private Word Perfect Party introducing us to his wonderful music and WP5. Funny, but the music has stood the test of time, and is better now before-- and has survived WP5.0!Like many others I have played the original so often that it amazes me how Kurts music has stood the test of time. I'll even admit I made a copy of the WP original for myself, because one day I lost the CD and went into a panic, because the music was not available for public purchase! (Talk about devotion.)The story of Innovators is a wonderful classic that follows other classical music stories of various parts and pieces of be the best innovators in history. It's a MUST HAVE. Get it while it's available."
3,Very Soothing,"This CD, which includes ONE song from Rhonda Byrnes 'The Power', really has a lot of great music on it. This CD introduced me to Mr. Bestor who really has new age-style talent in his music. Not as good as Yanni and Enya, but good all the same. Without listening to 'The Power' and writing down the credits at the end of the book on CD, I would never have happened upon Bestors work."
3,Review of BT325S,Works just fine with my iPod and cell phone via bluetooth. It would have been better to integratethe microphone in the earphone cables so that the controller can be attached to your belt. It's awkward to attach the integrated mic and controller anywhere on your body where the mic is effective.
1,Disappointed,"I have been on a rampage to try to read Newberry Award and Newberry Honor Books. I will soon assign students to read some of these great pieces of literature. I could not get myself to read this book. I tried at two diffent times, but I found it to be confusing, boring, and utterly disappointing. I asked a few other students for their opinions and 2 out of the 3 strong students could not get into it. Very disappointed. Why was this an honor book?"
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read!,I had to read this book for summer reading and by the second chapter I was completely confused. I talked to my friends about the book and they all hated it. The story isn't exciting and it doesn't have a good plot. What's the point of reading the book if you already know they win the Academic Bowl! Worst of all it is so confusing. They jump around from one place to another in and between chapters. I can't understand how this book received a Newbery Medal. My advice to you: don't read this book unless you have to.
3,Confusing,"Overall, The View from Saturday is pretty good. It has some interesting plots and unique characters. But it's very confusing and extremly...uh... different. To enjoy this book you must have an open mind. If you want to lay back and read to relax your mind, this book is not for you. It will give you a headache trying to figure out what's going on. This book is for people who think beyond the obvious on a daily basis, love to expand their mind, and like to see things in all different perspectives."
2,Not impressed,"I wanted to familiarize myself with middle grade literature, and picked this up at Barnes and Noble. I was extremely and unpleasantly surprised to find that the content of this book was as dry and uninteresting as, say, a tome on the use of a fork would be. I cannot imagine a single middle-school student who would find this interesting, or benefit from it. In fact, I looked up the Newbery Medal to find out how they award this honor. It's no surprise that popularity among children is not considered. That doesn't make any sense to me.Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this, whether you're an adult or a middle-school student. There are a great many books that teach you life lessons without being so arcane (and mundane)."
3,I enjoyed it and you will too,"I recommend ""The View from Saturday"" for kids ages 10 and up. It's a great book! The book is about four sixth graders who are beating the seventh and eighth graders in a sort of word contest. I enjoyed the book because in the book it's interesting that the four sixth graders form a team called ""The Souls"" and actually beat the seventh and eighth graders. You should read it!"
3,I read little snippets of it.,"Maybe I should have given this book a real chance, but so many different view points was distracting. I only read the parts relating to the Academic Bowl and didn't feel attached to the characters at all. My fault, but I couldn't get interested. All in all, ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"" by the same author was a far superior book."
4,"Not a classic, but leaves you smiling ...","This book starts off kind of slow, and the multiple viewpoints make it sort of confusing. It takes a while to get into. But once you've finished it, you're left with a smile on your face. The story of four children -- three boys and a girl -- who become an academic decathlon team. This is the story of how they met -- by attending tea parties on Saturday afternoons. Don't we wish we could all have friends like that ? Not as good as <EM>From the Mixed Up Files ...</EM> but worth reading. The only character I really disliked was Mrs. Olinski."
5,THIS BOOK WAS GREAT!!!!,This book is one of the best books I have read in a while. The author has done a great job of writing this book and has writen it in a wonderful point of veiw.This book teaches you about friendship and how you can become friends with the wierdest of people. The View From Saturday was a wonderful book. Everything about it was great. A MUST read!!
4,A page-turner of interwoven stories,"I really enjoyed this book. I liked how the author chose to switch back and forth from present to past to explain how the children answered the quiz questions. I love how I was slowly drawn into the lives of each character. I wanted to know how each one related to each other. The ending is sweet and touching, how the children were trying to lift the spirits of their teacher. I recommend this book for upper elementary or middle school level reading."
4,Insure vs. Ensure...,"I would like to respond to the snotty reviewer who demands Konigsburg made up the TIP acronym and got it wrong. While in today's standard English ""ensure"" would be grammatically correct, at the time of the origination of the ""tip"" jar in 18th century England creative or non-standard spelling was quite common. The acronym is correct and if you don't believe me, look it up in Webster's dictionary, they concur with Julian and the corrected Academic Bowl judges."
5,A gem,"""Every day has you do what you do everyday."" This is a lovely score, and ""Chanson"" makes it worthwhile. Buy it."
1,it doesnt fit the zune!!!!!!!,"well, i got this case to pretect my zune and well it doesnt work for the zune, and you have to really squeeze it in the case and it is so difficult to press the buttons (the play and back buttons)....i'd say buy another case that fits the zune better."
3,Not Up To Snuff,"This was a nice read, but I did not find it up to par with other books I have read by this author. It dragged a little. Characters where hard to care about. Guess that I missed the ususal cast of characters in the bulk of the plot. I will try again when a new book appears on the menu."
5,love this,this makes traveling with cakes easy. I love this.Purchasing from amazon; tracking your purchase is simple. would buy from them again.
1,CupCake Caddy Disaster,I did not like this at all. The cupcakes move around to much and fall over very to easy. I bought a 3 layer caddy at Bath Bed and Beyond carried up to 36 cupcakes. The holder where higher so they did not move around. This carrier is a big disater and I gave it away just to get rid of it.The first time I used it I was going to a picnic and I had the cupcakes in it. I put it gently on the table and some of the cupcakes fell sideways. This is just what I think. Good Luck:)
3,"Good for cakes, not cupcakes","Sturdy product, but it is bulky. Not good for traveling with cupcakes. The grooves are not high enough and the cupcakes fall over."
1,Poor service,I ordered 2 items for xmas. Only one item arrived on the 24th at 3 pm with a note saying that they were unable to fulfill the order and my bill would be adjusted. This left me scrambling to finish shopping at the very last minute. My bill was not adjusted until I filed an A-Z guarantee report. It would have been great if I had gotten an email stating the order couldn't be fulfilled so I could have looked elsewhere. Just poor customer service on the part of JoAnn's.
4,Great mat and bonus DVD,The quality of the mat is good but now that I use it regularly I wish it came with a strap or a bag. The free DVD is actually decent! It's short - just 15 minutes - but I've used it a few times in the morning or in conjuction with another exercise DVD.
2,Superficial first video,"First video on the DVD was very superficial and did not teach how to take a noon shot. The second was better, but not good enough to take a noon shot by itself. It referred to a data sheet which was not included. Overall not as good as the Davis Manual available on line for free."
5,Finally found these on Amazon!!!!!,Saw these advertised in a magazine and could NOT find them anywhere. Thank goodness for Amazon!!!!!!!!!!
4,"ESSENTIAL DVD SET FOR ""HALLOWEEN"" FANS","This 2-Disc 4-Hour Set is a ""must have""!If you're A Horror Movie Buff or just a person who appreciates ""Classics"", this exhaustive look at the iconic Horror series known as ""The Halloween Saga"" is a superb creation unto itself!What can I say?It's ALL there!Loaded with rare clips, photos and always amusing ""Interviews""...this Documentarycovers the whole series up to ""Halloween Resurrection""...but Rob Zombie (strangely enough) is there to talk about his love for the film, at least 3 years before a remake was even considered!The only thing that isn't mentioned as an inspiration for the series is the 1973 sci-fi film, ""Westworld"" which was actually the first to show a relentless, almost indestructible antagonist that could not be stopped no matter what the hero did!This DVD set is never less than enthralling.Just get it...and enjoy!"
4,Finally!,"As a hugh fan, i travelled from Ireland for the Convention in Pasadena, LA. i Was so thrilled to see that footage of the convention, photos etc made its way to the DVD. a great purchase for anyone who was at the convention and a must for ALL fans of the HALLOWEEN franchise. This was my first Purchase on Amazon, All i can say is, very impressed, it was delivered Quick!!"
5,"""See Anything You Like?""","Great nostalgic program of collective material! Great for fans, not for anyone else."
3,"Too little Cheap Trick and no Jon Brant, with either Pete Special or Robert Gordon, or especially Siren, All is Forgiven","Sorry, it's incomplete for the real essenceof the Chicago sound with Jon B Good. Howabout Mary and Blue Chicago? Wrong answer!"
4,top notch tester,"This jewel of an album is my pick for the best way to test your sound system. I've had this album in my collection for years and whenever someone talks jive about their system this one goes in. The superman theme demands to be played at 11 and everything is worthy of praise all the way through to good vibrations. I will admit that I have a health sense of nostalgia for this cd, but I recommend this cd as a diamond in the ruff. Sounds great and gets the ladies."
4,Screened Arbor,"Was fairly easy to put together, the screen had a small tear within the first two days but was patched. It seems to be waterproof right out of the box since we have been in it several times when it has been raining and only felt a few drops near the seams. The plastic bottoms of the legs broke part the day we put the stakes in the holes but luckily we had camping gear on stand by and used it to secure it more. It withstands the wind nicely, will lean a little but all in all it is a good product for the price snd size. Several people have commented on the look of it, they know it is not the local big box store brand."
1,waste of money,"Had this screen arbor up for a month on the deck. After a storm, it collapsed and bent the poles, leaving it unusable. Paid $135 for it. The company would not do anything about the damage, not even a discount on getting replacement poles. Purchased a $20 canopy from a retail drug store, and it survived a worse storm than the one that bent the wendover. Previously had a screen house for 10 years purchased from Sears. Don't waste your money !!"
2,Interesting and repetitive,"This book is very interesting but over-dramatized and drawn-out. The author belabors every point with patronizing prose and obvious observations. I listened to the audio version of this book and literally asked myself if I had accidentally inserted the same CD twice when I kept hearing the same thing over and over. That said, it is worth skimming through this piece to hear a fascinating perspective on the world's most powerful company."
2,wal-mart pub relations??,"Was confused by the great reviews. I downloaded the preview of this book and it read like a production of a slick walmart PR/lobbying firm. Les Scott, lionized! blarg..."
5,Ghost Sea,A gripping bit of fiction beautifully written by an author who is thoroughly familiar with his subject.
5,Raisel's Riddle,"Raisel's Riddle is a story that gives profound meaning to the Cinderella fairy tale , Jewish-style. Instead of beauty being the criterion for selection of a wife, Raisel's intelligence and knowledge are the ""charms"" that win the heart of ""Prince Charming,"" who in this story is a rabbi's son. Another irony is that instead of the woman having to pass the test of beauty, the man has to pass the test of intelligence and wit before Raisel agrees that he is fit to be her husband. Contrary to the feminist critique that Judaism is a system of patriarchal domination, including the idea that girls are not to be taught sacred lore in the same way as boys, Raisel, an orphan, grows up in the home of her grandfather, a Judaic scholar, who teaches her Torah and Talmud. ""Get thyself at once to Amazon.com and buy this book."" It is endearing and heartwarming.Rabbi Fred V. Davidow"
1,Why won't anyone answer?,"I still haven't received this CD. I have written to the supplier twice, and to Amazon at least once. No replies. I give up. It's only $11.47. Keep it."
2,Wrong Product Picture,"This review is NOT for what is pictured. What I ordered is the purple bottle picture you see, but what I got is something entirely different. The product I received is in a different bottle and it's light blue. It's a toner though. The one I did receive doesn't work well with sensitive skin. It burns and leaves red patches. I had used a retinol product recently and it caused that reaction I'm sure, but since my other toner didn't I can only assume this one isn't as non harsh as others. I typically give excellent reviews for H2O products, but because of what I received I can't do it this time. Order only from a certified seller of H2O, that's my best advice."
5,Gold Standard,"Barron's is THE SAT prep. It's kept updated to change with the SAT revisions, is easy to use and understand. Great for self-study."
5,Excellent,"Sturdy, portable, easy to use and (comparatively) inexpensive. If you don't currently have a miter saw stand, buy this one now and you'll wonder why you waited so long. I'll admit that before I bought this product, I assumed that it could only be that inexpensive by cutting corners on quality. (It was only the positive reviews that encouraged me to give it a try.) But, other than the price, there's nothing cheap about it. It's well build and seems extremely durable."
4,Solid value,"For the price, this is a excellent saw stand. It's solid and stable and will accommodate just about any miter saw on the market. The snap-off base is easy to use and clamps back onto the frame in one simple motion. Delta has made a quality product that won't break the bank."
1,I don't see what's so bright about this star,"When I read the back of ""The Life History Of A Star"", I expected a funny portrait of a generation gone by through the eyes of a girl close to my age. What I got was something entirely different. ""History"" starts out very vaguely, with Kristin, the main character, constantly referring to ""The Ghost"" without explanation. I had to read about a hundred pages before I finally figured out what had happened to her brother, although I guessed what it was beforehand. Kristin's dry, cynical humor was funny at first, but after a while it grew annoying. I don't see how anyone could view two hundred pages of whining and reminiscience as funny.The characters bother the reader, as well. Almost all of Kristin's friends throughout the book are mean to her and two dimensional. Her parents aren't involved in Kristin's life at all, and her mom is a bit crazy. Overall, I found ""The Life History Of A Star"" depressing and a waste of time."
1,The Life History of a Star,The book The Life History of a Star by Kelly Easton is about a girl who writes about all the problems in her life. She has a ghost in her attic. But really it is her brother back from the Vietnam War. But he is so sick that she calls him the ghost. Her mom and dad are getting a divorce because her mom doesn't like him anymore. Her best friend is going out with this guy. Her life is a total mess. I don't recommend this book to anyone. This book is pretty much a book about how depressing someone's life can really get. If you really do feel like finding out what happens to Kristen then read the book The Life History of a Star.
2,Rebate Mischief by this vendor,"Before you purchase this product you should be aware that Nova Development has an extremely unethical approach to processing the rebates they offer so prominently to move their product. For example, the address on the rebate form that you download from the Amazon site is located in Calabasas, CA. This is an old address for Nova Development. The Company has not provided the post office with a forwarding address, which causes any rebate submissions mailed to the Calabasas address to be returned to you as undeliverable by the USPS. This fact has been brought to the attention of Company representatives by many customers and the vendor has done nothing to correct this problem. Get the picture? Nova Development will place as many hurdles in front of you as possible to scam you out of your paltry $10 rebate. We as customers have a duty to refuse to do business with unethical companies like Nova Development."
5,Berlitz Spanish Premier,Product is amazing. Learning is easy. Can't believe I received so much product; and paid so little. Best pricing around.
4,Good Product,"Good product, bought it as a gift for my wife and she really liked it. recommended to buy it. Nice look. the image through the glasses are great."
1,Don't waste money,This thing never worked for me.Does nt work with any usb printer. The installation guide and the customer service sucks.The product and the packing also looked like a used product.
2,Caution,"The first Chunky Chew I received worked pretty well for my 60 lb heavy chewer dog. The chew lasted for a few days. However, my second order for two is not proving to be as good. The chew my dog is working on is hollow and was not rolled tight when it was made. This results in a brittle hollow tube that is cracking and shattering into small hard pieces. It sounds like my dog is crunching a hard plastic tube instead of a ""chew"". I would advise caution before buying since you cannot inspect these before purchasing."
5,Made in USA - excellent quality,Bought this for my small dog about 8 months ago and she is still loving it! She is a habitual chewer and quickly destroyed all of the toys we bought for her including the nylon chew bones. Decided to try this large rawhide - mostly because it is made in USA. By now she has chewed one knot completely off and is working her way down to the next knot. She can work on it for hours and it doesn't deteriorate and disappear like other rawhides I've tried. Strongly recommend!
5,Great Read,"This book starts out slow, but it draws you in and before you know it you're really into the plot. Contrary to the other review I saw, I don't find this book negative or degrading at all. This book does a wonderful job painting a picture of the lives of these characters. The characters are all written in a realistic matter and it's easy to relate to them. Meisha did a great job on her first book and I very much look forward to seeing more from her. I highly reccomend this book."
3,Blackened my shoes,"The kit is quite small, but I imagine it will work for blackening my shoes at least 20 times before I run out of polish. For $6, definitely worth it."
5,Really great c.d.,"This c.d. is awesome, but remember to buy it new, not used because the proceeds are donated to the national breast cancer foundation!! The music on this c.d. is so worth paying full price!!!!"
3,It was a good cause,"I found that I only liked a couple of the songs, but it went for a good cause, so money well spent."
5,Great CD!,"I have to say that I originally bought this cd for the track, ""Halo"", because I love the song. I've really come to love some other songs on this album as well. If nothing else, buy the cd and hear ""Halo"" first, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Awesome CD!,"I just got this CD yesterday, and I can't stop listening to it. Every song is phenominal and really captures you where you are. My favorites include ""Feeling a moment"" by Feeder, ""Always Love"" by Nada Surf, ""Missing You"" by Tyler Hilton, and ""Halo"" by Bethany Galeotti. If you're a fan of the show, this is a must have, and even if you're not it's an awesome addition to your music collection. Buy it!!"
2,What good is speed when there are so many potholes?,"I bought this along with a Scanjet 7650. The HP/Vista system was quite ""buggy"" with frequent spontaneous shutdowns, freeze-ups, and failure of the OS to recognize the scanner. I called HP support and got the most incredible advice - I could either subscribe to HP paid help ($149.00) or reformat the hard drive, go buy Windows XP and install that on the computer instead. But no willingness to trouble-shoot the problem. I have since rolled back the computer twice to the original factory settings but the bugs and blue screens persist. I agree with Van that it might all be in the OS, but I bought this as a tool, not a hobby, so Amazon is getting it back."
3,Not for the lactose-intolerant,"The premise of this book is sound, unfortunately, my young son is lactose intolerant and most of her suggested snack/meal alternatives involve dairy. Really disappointing on that front."
3,Doesn't do a good job,"Embryology is a subject of change; from the egg and sperm, to the blastocyst, to the embryo, to the fetus. Learning embryo can be difficult, and Langman's certainly didn't help with the understanding. One of my major complaints is the lack of diagrams that outline processes."
2,Makes a confusing subject even worse,"It's hard to believe that people love this book. It's our text for first-year embryology in med school, and it's pretty awful. More illustrations would make it better; defining terms before using them would make it better; better layout would make it better and less confusing (who on earth was the graphic artist that designed this thing?).The Simbryo CD is marginally helpful; it has monotonous music (think porn-movie soundtrack) and doesn't have nearly enough detail on the particularly confusing stages of folding etc. The MacBaby software covers the early stages much, much better.Strengths are clinical correlations and the focus on human embryology.I hope to find a better book before our next exam."
2,"A good overview, not very high-yield",For everyone thinking of using this to study for the boards - don't. I bought this book when I started medical school (back when I thought I had to buy every book) and I attempted to use it to study for the boards. Needless to say it wasn't the best choice. There are other books available that can help you make more sense out of the subject.
5,A Serious but Not Too Serious Look at a Fun Subject,"Master tin smith Bobby Hansson serves up an interesting and very entertaining book on the many colorful objects one can make from simple tin cans, that is, how to make little treasures from a material one would normally consider as rubbish, worthy - at best - of the recycling bin. Objects range from useful items such as lanterns and dishes and cups to jewelry and toys. Included in this profusely illustrated book are examples from Mr. Hansson's own studio, complemented by pieces from around the world. The section on toys, for example, includes a public taxi from Haiti and a motorcycle from Burkina Faso, both from art collectors. The author shows artists at work and offers both the novice and experienced tin smith great tips on creating highly artistic, original, and iteresting pieces. Yes, he takes this art form seriously - as he should - but not too seriously. The book is written in a light and humorous style, making it a joy to read."
2,Beautiful Lamp but Shade's Quality a Concern,"We bought this lamp directly from Lamps Plus about 4 years ago and have absolutely loved it.Sadly, today the top of the shade, which bears the weight of the entire shade, came apart whereit was spot welded to the base support. While we can probably find a fabric replacement shade,it was the Mission glass that gave this lamp its considerable appeal."
2,Recording/Engineering Quality Renders this Album Nearly Unlistenable,"I'm not sure if it is because of the cd being an Anniversary reissue or what but it sounds like the orchestra was being recorded in a vacuum. The sound of the recording is muddy and suppressed and thus renders the music inaccessible. One of the other two reviewers remarked on this aspect earlier but seemed to downplay the significance. This is not to remark negatively on the mastery of the conductor Ander Previn or on the Royal Philharmonic. It just so happens with some classical recordings that no matter how brilliant the intrepretation (which strikes me as average for the symphony 4), a flawed production can be the ruination of any album."
5,Thanks Secret Hiding Places,The hiding place in the book was brillant! (The Hollow Book) My brother and sister cant find my stuff! Thanks alot!
5,A mouse with the cheese can't be pleased,"I bought the book about a year ago, when my cousin would sneak into my room and take money. I made a video vault and a hollow book to hide it in. My brother made a decoy with a whole bunch of fake paper bills and a mouse trap under it all. My cousin got that bright lightbulb of an idea and tip-toed into my room. He saw the 'money' ane must have taken two fistfuls when SNAP!!! It wasn't pretty, my cousin broke his finger, but I thought the book was awesome."
3,catch anything lately?,"Not a great outing - in fact, a bit of a snore. Janis' intonation leaves a lot to be desired, but mostly it's just a boring album."
3,***,"Not the best Janis Siegel CD but it has a couple of nice colours...That Old Black Magic taken a tad slower, with more whimsy but still jazzy in contrast to the hot, raunchy ""I Just Wanna Make Love To You"""
2,Motorola beats Jabra,Jabra a125s functions well. Motorola is on a par. But you have to charge Jabra and a couple other things. But all you have to do is plug in the Motorola to the IPOD and you're listening on bluetooth. Sorry Jabra. I got my Motorola on sale at Radioshack for just under fifty bucks.
4,Jabra Bluetooth,Fast service and product works. The only thing is product keeps on slipping off from the Ipod.
4,If you really love 'em ...,"I've lived in LA for several years now. Sure the warm weather is nice, the palm trees are awesome, the babes is off da hook. But what's really sold me on Southern California is the Comida Mexicana. And the burrito is king! Who cares if it's not even Mexican? This book will get your mouth watering just by flipping the pages. If you really love burritos, you'll really love !Burritos!."
5,A funny cook book for smart people,"I just read this book from cover to cover while I sat alone, laughing out loud in my favorite coffee shop. Burritos! Hot on the Trail of the Little Burro is a cook book, sort of. It's really about burritos; the history, sociology, science, philosophy, mystique, and music of them. There are taqueria reviews and yes, even some recipes and cooking instructions are included. I learned a lot, laughed a lot, and was even inspired to go to the kitchen and try to make my own burritos. Who'd have thought it?"
5,Wit and Information about Burritos,"Full of really interesting information not only about burritos themselves, but about any subject that can in any way be related to burritos - . And it's written in a very witty, intelligent, and bright way that makes for laughs on every page.You'll like it -"
5,"Corruption and conspiracy in Muncie, Indiana","A fascinating book about real-life corruption and conspiracy in Muncie, Indiana. If you lived in Muncie during the late '60s and '70s and followed local politics and current events, you'll know who many of the characters are in this book even though the names have been changed.The story revolves around Davis' attempt to discover who planted the car bomb that nearly killed his police officer father. His quest takes him on a journey through a small-time world of corrupt politicians, corrupt labor unions, bad cops and greedy businessmen. Add an assortment of prostitutes, hit men and petty thieves and you'll see why Muncie has been nicknamed ""Little Chicago."""
5,Snow Plowing gear,"My son does snow plowing on the side and is exposed to the elements be it snow, rain, hail, sleet. Having been a lobsterman before his present job he remembers well the protection he had wearing Grundens. With that said .... I bought him the same gear for snowplowing. He is no longer wet or cold and is now a much happier snowplower. Excellent item."
5,He shoots...He SCORES,"I really enjoyed this book. I have missed Myron and the gang and was so glad that the story lived up to my anticipation.The story had a good edgy tension that kept me on the edge of my seat but also had the wonderful Myron sense of humor. The scene in the Florida airport with Myron's parents was very funny. I thought the ending was very interesting, I liked the ""saved the girl ... then really truly saved his friends baby"" ending.Esparanza was a Hoot and Win is a great character. We got more insight into his character. And ""we built this city"" was a great way to let Myron know the cavalry had arrived. One of those out loud exclamation moments one gives while reading. Mine was a big YES!!I hope to see a Bolitar book again real soon."
3,"Leave narration to professionals, please","While Coben adequately portrayed the voices of Win and most women, his alternative ""voices"" for men were cartoonish. They all sounded like doofuses. Someone mentioned Barney Rubble. That was on the mark.I enjoyed this story in the beginning but then the plot got so entangled that I began to lose interest. In his attempt to ""fool"" the reader, the author goes out in the weeds to piece his plot together. I've had a problem with Coben's heavily-laden dialogue in the end of his books to explain the ""mystery"". Strikes me as a bit amateurish when someone has to resort to a lot of dialogue to explain the story's end."
3,"Decent, but not the best Coben work","I tried this particular book both as an audio book and traditional paperback. The audio book was not worthwhile. The reading wasn't good, and the story didn't intrigue me (too much of the beginning seemed to be backstory that could have been left out or merely alluded to later). About 1/4 of the way through, the CD began skipping badly, so I gave up and switched to the written word. Without the reading to distract me, the story was better, but still wasn't Coben's best work.This happened to be the first Myron Bolitar book I picked up, which may have been my problem. It did, however, stand alone quite well, without major references to previous books or plots. Some characters seemed to be thrown in randomly, without moving the plot along. In the end, it felt contrived and unsatisfying."
3,"Fun, but not his best work","I've enjoyed and, I dare say, ravenously consumed everything Coben has written to date. I love and miss the crazy comic-book-like regulars from the Bolitar series, and it was good to see them again. All in all, this was a pretty good read, although far from Coben's best work. Definitely an interesting ""hook"" in the beginning, and a twisty end, which are very Coben."
2,Not up to par,I was anticipating this new Myron Bolitar book since it has been a while since a book in the series has been released. I just finished reading the book and much to my disappointment it wasn't worth the wait.The story dragged and the relationship between Win and Myron was much scaled back. The one reaction I had after finishing the book was who cares?
5,Mysteries,Always a good read and never figure out the villian until the last few pages!! Excellent reading. Hard to put down
1,Stick to writing!,"I'm a big fan of Harlan Coben's previous non-Bolitar works and thought I'd give this audio CD a go. What a disappointment! Coben has two voices: one for Bolitar and another hybrid snooty/feminine/smarmy one for whomever Bolitar is speaking to at the time. The ""other"" voice doesn't even stay consistent from one line to the next - listen to his interactions with Claire or Erik if you need convincing - it was difficult to keep the characters straight if there were more than 3 in one scene.Stick to the writing, Mr Coben, and leave the audio to the pros."
1,This no longer works...,"I reviewed this already in the other packaging but don't waste your money. I used to use this all the time and it worked well (although yes it did stink.) Well they've changed the formula(and it stil stinks.) When using it previously it would remove about 99% of the hair. Now it simply-does not work. So it's not me, or my hair, or too much hair, or improper use,etc. It just doesn't work anymore."
3,A bear to put together,"I ordered this quilt rack for my wife. The jury is out on how well it will really work, but I have to tell you this was horrible to put together. Mainly because the instructions sucked. Also I had to make 3 trips to the hardware store to purchase a few missing nuts and bolts. Yes I know I should have checked all the parts first then I could have contacted the company and waited 7 to 10 days for the missing parts. But who in their right mind would count ever one of the hundreds of pieces of hardware? Anyhow they could do a much better job with the assembly instructions. It took us about 10 hours over two days."
2,I think that he could have made it a little more interesting,I think that it is a little to imature for readers in the high school level. I am in the 10th grade and i thought it could have been more 1990's version. S.M.
1,Mas horrible,This gun sucks really bad. do not buy. with in the first day the battery compartment broke and i had to tape it. there is no way this gun could shoot 200 fps. more like 50 fps. theres no way that this gun is comparable to tokyo marui. theres not even a gun like that for 100 bucks. DO NOT BUY!!! ps. i was dissapointed
3,"In some cases, a ""plus"" can be a minus","This is the 5th in a series of various artists albums that Telarc released in the mid-80s.As usual, the selections are diverse and the performers skilled. In this collection we hear everything from requiems to electronic Beethoven to a sea shanty and showtunes-- all in the space of an hour. This interesting and eclectic mix is unfortunately followed up by eight minutes of explosions, cannons and gunfire. This is the supposed ""plus"" that Telarc advertised in the disc's name, ""Sampler Five Plus.""Tracks 21 thru 38 (the ordinance offerings) come with a warning that playing these recordings could potentially damage your stereo's speakers; the user is also advised not to wear headphones for them -- two more reasons to wonder why they've been included at all. My advice is listen to the excellent music on Telarc Sampler, Vol. 5, and skip the fireworks altogether."
1,Do not buy this item,"Ordered this for my pressure cooker that was my Mom's. Probably made in 1960s. I have the original owners manual so I knew exactly which part number I needed. Unfortunately the first thing they sent me was a pressure valve, not a gasket seal. Doesn't look anything alike. They quickly recitified the situation and sent me the gasket seal. Unfortunately, it is not made to the right specifications. The rubber is too thin and it does not seal the lid. Therefore the stream escapes around the lid and I no longer have a pressure cooker. So do not buy this item if you have an old pressure cooker. Even though I needed an S-9885, this one is not made right and won't work. It needs to be thicker rubber. Errrr.....Buyer beware."
5,Language of Medicine...Great Book!,I love the book...It is very descriptive and has helped me tremendously with my medical terminology. I recommend it to anyone looking to do better with terminology.
2,Lokks Great But Maybe Not,"This console is well built and designed with usefull compartments. The really bad thing about it is that the console won't stay on the hump in my car. The area that sits on the hump is too small, it definitely needs to be deeper with little spikes so it will fit the contour of the hump and grab on to the carpet."
3,Incompatible with IBM T40,"This card is not compatible with IBM T40,40p,41,41p laptops. Even though it is almost exactly the same card that IBM will sell you for twice as much, the bios in these laptops will stop you before windows can even boot. In any other laptop it is probably a nice card. Just a friendly word of warning."
1,Don't be fooled! Read this review,"This CD is the ""Keeping the legend alive"" concert, in one of the many poorly made, shortened reissues.Just get the original CD/DVD, with the full concert on both audio and video. Don't say I didn't wan you!"
1,"Love the Webkinz Franchise, Not Overpriced Toys","I love the regular Webkinz, but these are WAAAAY too expensive. The most I would ever pay for these is $30. (Maybe each.) This is an outrage!!! I really wanted the Cheeky Cat, but obviously these are way too expensive."
3,"Cute, but not substantial","This is a slim volume of suggestions to ""make your dog smile,"" accompanied by some adorable doggie portraits. Many of the suggestions are repetitive (how many different ways can doggie massage be described?), but the presentation is what counts. The doggie ""bios"" (of the photography subjects - all in NYC) in the back are a cute addition.This would make a cute gift for a dog lover who has everything else!"
5,Worth it just for the pictures...,"...and a great gift book. I've done a lot of work with dogs (and am the author of ""Lessons to Live By: The Canine Commandments"") and think I can really tell when dogs are happy. This book does a beautiful job of capturing happy dogs!"
2,What?,The shade looks different from the picture here. It did not go on smoothly. You'd think it would. I have cheaper nail polish that glides on more smoothly. Did I just get a bad batch?
5,Along The Infant Way,This book has saved my life in terms of getting my children to sleep on their own and get throught the tough nursing period. I used their methods on both my children and their sleeping patterns are a dream!!
5,Just what I needed!,"Probably most people don't use a pressure cooker these days, but since my mother always used one, I do, too. I have one of the ""old"" ones, and I love it! Have had to replace the gasket a number of times, and one used to be able to go to the neighborhood hardware store to pick one up. No more ... so I was so glad to find this available on Amazon!"
1,Worst book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!,"This book was terrible. In the past year I have read over 200 books and this is the worst!!! The first two chapters were good and had lots of potential, but the rest of the book is psycho!! It changes to the inside of the main character's mind. I hoped with every page it would get better, it didin't. SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can not express how bad it is."
2,a book that takes a while to get into,"i actually am still reading this book but so far I have found the story to have only really gripped me in the the last third of the book(where Jo is in college). however this is only the 3rd day I have had this book and Im allready this far. what i find strange is how so much of the personality of Jo is based on your perceptions of her thoughts, since so much of the book is taking place in her mind, and that isn't a real person's personality. there is another book with the same title of the cheerleader written by a different author that talks about the SAME exact thing as this one-a girl going through a depression for the same reasons. anyway i found the last part very interesting, so if you want to just skip to that part i wouldn't say you were missing much."
3,Doomed again...,"Doomed again to wandering black corridors with some really crappy weapons. The grabber is probably the worst. Its also the hardest to use and must be used to get by the first level, which seems to be virtually impossible. I'm tired of them using the darkness to compensate for decent graphics. It's also a major pain trying to switch between weapons and a light, your doomed right off the bat. The baddies are badder than ever and tougher to kill with lousy weapons and no light. For pure fun, I still say Painkiller and it's expansion pack blow this game away.I don't really understand all the glowing reviews on this title."
4,A very good start for breaking into the field,"with all the information and associations/organizations training and informing about the vast field of fitness, this book breaks it down and gives a well written and concise description of the various areas of fitness instruction and training. It covers all aspects of gaining employment in the field and does a good job."
1,RCA TV/VCR Combo,"We purchased this TV/VCR combo for use in the kitchen and to put in our minivan for long trips so the kids could be entertained. I found the unit's quality to be suspect at every turn. I should know better than buy RCA, and I will know not to in the future. We would use the push buttons instead of the remote in the kitchen, and lo and behold the on/off button pushed in all the way and broke off. Now a gaping hole exists. The tracking and VCR picture has been atrocious and the sound quality pathtic for even a 13 inch TV. Speakers on the side of the unit does not help. I suggest going with Toshiba or a brand you can trust."
1,Digital Copy Not Compatible with iTunes,"Beware, this is an Android only Digital Copy. It will not download if you only have iTunes/iPhone. Fox, in all their wisdom, is punishing iTunes users because of their disagreements with Apple."
2,Too Bad,"[SPOILERS AHEAD] First two-thirds of the film? Fairly riveting and very well acted. The final third? So far-fetched and ridiculous that I have to give the entire film a thumbs-down. I think it's a copout when a writer has to kill someone off to add gravity to a story, as if what was originally on the page wasn't enough. Why can't this JUST be about a guy's sex addiction? Added to that, the part where our main character metaphorically and literally crosses the street to have (shame of shames!) sex with another man because he's so desperate for sex (complete with swelling score to underline his depravity) is nothing less than backhanded homophobia - not to mention just plain lazy storytelling. Despite its documentary-like camerawork and hipster, fly-on-the-wall pseudo-realism, this film's sensibilities are clearly rooted in 1950s melodrama."
1,Waste,I wanted this movie to be good. It was not. I had to purchase the DVD because I had no other means of watching it because if the rating. I'm not even sure why it had an nc-17 rating.
4,A Man Lost,"This is a worthy follow-up film by Steve McQueen after his brilliant and chilling ""Hunger"" also starring Michael Fassbinder. It is about a man in a big unforgiving city on the brink of self-destruction relying on purchasing sex as temporary relief. Both Fassbinder and Mulligan are very fine with fitting photograhy and music as if from antiseptic lenses and pipes. Not an easy film to sit through but one must admire its makers and actors."
5,A superb Porter songbook,"Steve Ross is without doubt one of the finest cabaret artists currently working, and this recording amply proves his talent. Steve takes loving stroll through the Porter canon, embellishing each song with his own brand of wit and sensitivity. His excellence as a pianist and knowing way with a lyric make for a superb listen. Every track is a superlative example of Steve's artistry. Not to be missed."
1,Horrible....Just plain horrible..,"This is something that is SO WACK, you just have to hear it to believe it. Aimed at the country bumpkins who actually like this crap, this has to be one of the worst songs of the year, but will probably get love from the Trash Money Or No Talent listeners."
5,Just what I expected,"I ordered this CD for my daycare kids and my own kid's party times. They love it, thanks!"
3,Good cheap TV,I've had one of these for over a year now. I use it 30-45 minutes almost every day watching the news and weather in the bathroom while showering and getting ready for work. Never had a problem with it. Good picture. Okay sound.
4,Great Irish Stories better than Angela's Ashes,"I read all the Agnes Browne novels and absolutely loved every one!! They are heartwarming, sad and extremely funny, especially if you come from an Irish background. Anjelica Hustom made the Mammy into a move and it was hysterical. The only little problem i noticed is that in one book Agnes' mother's name is Maria and in other it is Constance. I like to ask Mr. O'Carroll how that happened."
5,GREAT STORY ABOUT ONE IRISH FAMILY,"This is a wondeful story about one Irish family living in Dublin. It starts with and follows the life of Agnes Browne. These particular stories start with Agnes becomming a widow and is on her own raising seven children. The author is a natural story teller. He follows the escapades of this wonderful family, it's ups and it's downs. Character developement and humor are the strongest feature of this trilogy. The author is a natural story teller and you will find your self laughing out loud throughout these books as well as shedding a few tears. I cannot recommend this series high enough."
5,Chiropractic without bonejoint snapping,"Interesting book. The author's thesis is that all parts of the body need to be in alignment: all body parts should be square and plumb in order to avoid miscelaneous aches and pains. Egosque uses the force of gravity to bring the body into alignment.I have had back pain for years following my spinal lamenectomy. After about a week of trying them, Egosque's ""Ecises"" seems to be helping to ease my pain. I recommend the book."
1,Groin tear caused by Supine Groin Stretch,"In physical therapy, I was given the Supine Groin Stretch to help improve my posture and the way I walk. Even though it was only for 5 minutes each leg, that was enough force to tear my groin. I have been in pain and barely able to walk for over two months now. Unfortunately, ""Pain Free"" does not include instructions to modify the exercises, but assumes everyone can do them safely."
5,Pain Free,Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic PainThis is a fabulous book. I had borrowed it from a a friend and decided I wanted my own copy. The concept is when your muscles are not strong your body is out of alignment and causes pain. The exercises don't require any expensive equipment and they work. The exercises also are not exhausting nor time consuming. In a few minutes a day you can do them. I love this book and system.
5,Amazing Book,"I absolutely loved this book. It gives an amazing common sense approach to stopping chronic pain... and it WORKS!I suffered chronic knee and shoulder pain, plus random aches and pains everywhere else, for about 10 years. Doctors said I needed surgery and pain pills. I didn't want to go that route. I found this book and read it in one sitting, then tried what it said. Within 48 hours my pain was gone. I started feeling about 10 years younger - as if someone had put oil in my joints. Nearly five years later I am still Pain Free and I take absolutely no medication and had no surgery. All it takes is about 10-20 minutes a day of easy-cises which can be done while watching TV.I am sending a copy of this book to everyone I know who suffers from chronic pain."
5,My husband swears by this book,"He received it a a gift from my brother in law who is a doctor. My husband had a serious herniated disc problem that caused him to break down in tears because of pain. In addition to PT, the Egoscue exercises had him pain free in 3 months--a much faster time frame than what the orthopedist had predicted. I have been using the methods whenever my aches and pains flare up (my work is very physically demanding 0. We are also sending a copy of the book to his aunt who is supposed to receive a knee replacement soon."
1,Disappointing!,Poorly organized and confusing. Had hoped to find some advice for dealing with the type of pain I have. Found absolutely nothing. The index is useless and the content repetitive and frustrating!
5,Life Saving Book - anyone can live pain free...,I have had some major pain for the last 9 years from a car wreck - this book is a life saver. You will notice a difference right away. but ONLY If you do the movements :-) I bought a copy for each of my children AND one for my office manager.
2,Not so sure this does much,I have my doubts this does much. My brother went to the clinic and spent a few bucks (more than a few) and has his doubts that it is effective. He did that first (very time consuming routine) and then had the hip surgery he was trying to avoid. The surgery appears to have taken care of his pain and limited range of motion
5,Egoscue nailed it with this approach!,"This is the very best for those who wish to learn ""self-help"" methods and pain management relative to the spinal column. It addresses all the major pivot points in the human body. I've dealt with two disc-herniations on L4-L5, L5-S1 and surgical procedures on both. If I'd had access to this book over the last 25 years, I could have very possibly alleviated the pain/agony on my own, and saved a small fortune $$$ in the process.When doing these exercises over a week, if done correctly, you will get some relief. Period!It also address ergonomic seating with it's perils and why it doesn't always work with everyone.I spend hours on the computer, and these 'e-cises' have helped preserve my 'sanity'."
5,Common Sense Exercise For Pain,"People who have had pains anywhere from toes to necks, have probably tried a host of treatments, as I have. Egoscue's approach would seem to defy profound treatment methods because they rely on positioning or re-positioning major muscle groups. All of this is based on his understanding of how, as we go through life, we tend to compensate for injuries, strains, etc by changing the natural alignment of our bodies. HIs methods, when followed for significant periods of time, quietly bring the body back to its proper state. It may not work for everyone, but for the conditions he notes in his book, they do seem to work and it's a pleasure to consider the rest of my life living without the kinds of pain that can be healed by following his teachings"
3,Pain Free,I believe it has useful information. One of the exercises I tried was too painful to continue. Others were okay.
4,"Nice Sphyg, bad stethoscope","If you're strapped for cash this is your best bet, the stethoscope is not very clear and just down right bad, the sphyg works well, but the stethoscope is not up to the same standards. It can listen to heartbeat but don't expect much more from that, the sensitive high frequency diaphragm is unclear. Keep in mind the stethoscope is also very painful and tight on your ears and it will hurt.If you are simply getting a sphyg and steth to take your own BP in your house for example, this would be a good investment, the stethoscope serves its purpose.If you don't want to spend a lot this is not a bad model."
1,Don't buy this Prestige product,"The gauge ( sphygmomanometer ) didn't work at all, right out of the box. Instead of returning it to Amazon, as I should have, I made the mistake of returning it to Prestige for replacement. Three weeks later and I'm still waiting for a replacement. An email inquiry to them brought back a canned response that it's probably the mail. The guy never even looked up what happened to my return. Lousy company! Buy from one of the many other choices here at Amazon."
5,You'll be surprised at the quality of this for the price. 5 STARS,"My son is studying to be an EMT and wanted to purchase this combo medical set. Honestly when I saw the price I didn't expect much. I was very wrong. The product arrived well packaged and very quickly. It came in a nice carrying case which is convenient. You'll be surprised at the quality of this product for the price. Very nice, would most definitely recommend and my son says it's works exactly as advertised. He's very pleased with the purchase."
2,BP Combo,I am a PT working in home health and am not incredibly pleased with the product. The cuff is fine but the BP is very hard to hear with the stethoscope. I will likely return this product and get a better stethoscope.
3,Quick response to my purchase.,The directions included are not as clear to understand as they could be about how to position the sphygmomanometer.
4,Prestige Sphygmomanometer,I wish iwas better able to hear the heart beat with the stethescope was a little easier to hear the heart beat.
4,Cheech & Chong in their prime!,"This is Richard ""Cheech"" Marin and Tommy Chong in their first starring role together. This film is Cheech & Chong in their prime. There is so much to laugh at here, your tummy will hurt like a lizard's. The DVD version includes ""Roach Clips"" which are outtakes from the film. This has an optional commentary you can click on. After you have seen the film, watch it again with the Audio Commentary by Director Lou Adler and Cheech Marin. You'll find out alot of interesting tidbits. After this film Cheech & Chong were destined to become a success. Many of us began buying all the albums they could make. This film included has a vinyl album soundtrack released Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke. This album included much of the music soundtrack used in the film, like ""Low Rider"". Some of the highlight scenes in the film are also recoreded on the album too like the memorable Strothers Martin scene and the Ajax Lady scene. The next film is CHEECH & CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE (1980)."
5,Smoke Wit Me I'll Smoke Wit U,"Up Somkes, Is Where My Money Goes, In My Lungs Or Somtimes Up My Nose. Fasheez This Is A Tokers CKlassik.

4,Up in smile...,"When I watched this movie by the first time on TV I just cried. It has been one of the most funny movies I've seen. I loved it, specially the scene when Cheech met Chong. A bunch of fun and laughs."
5,"Awesome, Hilarious, and very Seventies","This was life in the seventie's -- Do drugs, get in a rock n roll band, and Vietnam post war, ""Don't look at the birthmark man."" As for the guy from August 27th, FLOYD, Got a question for you. ""How long did it take you to build that world you live in?"" Your suppose to Critique the Movie, Floyd, Not your drug trip while you were trying to watch it."
3,A good attempt at softening this frightening subject,"First of all, there is nothing elementary about fluid dynamics. This book was recommended in a course I took as a first year Chemistry PhD student. If I didn't have a professor there to ask questions to, I would have never understood this subject just from this book. It is a good reference to this subject, but definitely has no sections that read like a cover-to-cover introductory textbook. Everything I needed to know and more is in there, I just have to read sections over and over to understand it!"
5,Keila's Gift,"One of my students, Keila, brought in this book for story time today. Although I'd had planned on reading another book, the title intrigued me and I wanted to know more about it. Just by looking at the front cover, I was reminded of another book with a similar subject. So, I put the other book down and ended up reading this book to my 4th & 5th grade students. They loved it. After I finished reading it, we discussed it and they offered their thoughts on it. They loved how helpful the children in the story were. They were very impressed with this book.This book is highly recommend- especially for a Special Education class!"
1,Was this book even editted?,"This is yet another example of someone publishing ""true"" facts, before checking on their authenticity. Sometimes I wonder if editors even exist anymore for a number of newspapers and books, given the number of false stories touted as true. Regarding this particular book, you can check out its stories at www.snopes.com, which prints the research and checkable sources for each of their ""is it true or not"" determinations re urban legends such as those contained in this book. (E.g., the one in the book re someone who strapped a super-powerful engine to the top of their car, ignited it, and crashed into a cliff; FALSE, and confirmable as false EASILY by checking the sources listed by snopes.)Save your money and don't buy this book, unless you just want to amuse yourself with some made up stories. (Some people seem to LOVE that, given that they forward e-mails of stories such as those in this book, without bothering to do even the easiest research to see if the story is true.)"
2,Tall Tales---Mostly Not True,"This book is jammed with stories drenched in IRONY...more than humor. Few (if any) stories are true. Some of the tales are recognizably taken from news stories, but were so greatly embellished as to be mostly fiction. The stories are oddball, but disappointing overall. Few envoke even a smile. The author and publisher insult their reader's intelligence by labeling these preposterous tall tales as true."
3,The Sound Stinks!,"Okay... It was great to have this on DVD, but I was horrified by the sound. It was not so bad as to make the disc unwatchable, but still very disturbing nonetheless. If you can get the disc used, or borrow a friend's copy, I suggest doing that. If you still have your old laserdisc, hang onto it!If you have never seen the pilot and are a big TP fan, it is worth it for the story, but it is about 20 minutes shorter than the VHS (and LD) version."
2,"Where there's no sense, there's no feeling.","It's the TP pilot episode which makes it a must have for the TP collector but is this really the best they could do? Whack out a really crappy direct tansfer, ignore all the phase distortion in the sound and just get it on the market for a few bucks? Was Ben Horne involved here? There is so much love and detail in the ""Episodes"" collection of the series that I can't believe this was actually released to the public. David Lynch, help! Push some buttons, make something happen. Get a better pilot with a few extra features released. I'll rebuy it."
1,Horrible Sound,"I purchased this DVD imported from Singapore. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE TWIN PEAKS and the Pilot is awesome. However, how can anyone watch it with a metalic sound that makes your hair stand up?? I find that unacceptable. The Pilot should have been part of The Season 1 set...but it wasn't...so, if you really want to get it, it's better on VHS, even though it's harder to find one that hasn't been over-played to affect the picture quality."
3,"Not worth the price, but...","It's a pity that this masterpiece, that revolutionized the whole TV industry, it's available in such a pitiful package. This pilot is a Chinese DVD with an acceptable picture and a somewhat defective sound. Subtitles are available in Chinese, Mandarin, and English, but this language is so badly brutalized that, if you are hard of hearing, you better don't turn the subtitles on, because there are mistakes or letter transpositions every other world.Overall, the price is too excessive for the quality of the product. It's actually a stick-them-up in a black Shanghai alley. However, we ""peakers"" have to satiate our cravings any way we can, so bite the bullet until a better DVD is available.Anyway, to be able to recreate the feelings that the TV series arose on us, those many years ago when we were young, and happy, and were not aware of it, is well worth the expense. Because these are the small things that make what might well be a gray day, one full of joy and grace."
5,Courage and Determination,"Pam Flowers explains the challenges of her year-long journey with an incredible clear headed humility. Her determination to succeed and push forward against what were sometimes mind numbing odds, while also having the wisdom to know when to push forward and when to stop and rest, for at least a little while, are remarkable. Despite her decade of training and extensive preparation, one has to wonder about the hazards that she experienced on this trip. Her brief journal descriptions can't fully explain what she and her eight dogs must have gone through in crossing the Arctic alone during cold dark winter, and even worse during spring breakup. Her story carries several lessons - the importance of training and preparation, of perseverence and determination, and that a person can accomplish whatever they want to do if they are willing to really give what it takes. She has."
2,Don't Buy,"Cute tv - very good for the office, but after about 6 months the button to switch between tv & radio stop working. So now I don't have a tv or radio to listen to. Save your money, buy something else."
3,Pulling for Victor,"The gangly, greasy and awkward life of teens in puberty and the many hassles, crisis and dramas are lovingly presented in Raising Victor Vargas. Love, in a variety of forms is constantly apparent and comes through by way of the raw talent of the many actors making their film debut. Not to worry, sweet Victor will turn out all right with a heart as big as his.Michael Durankowww.bootism.com"
2,Worth seeing once...probably never again,"After all the fanfare I kept waiting for this movie to get good. There were some subtle subplots going on. It is mostly a tale of poverty and inner city coming of age. I don't feel I really took anything introspective away from this movie, and it wasn't artistic cinima. It had a few good laughs, lots of sibling rivalry drama, disfunctional teen love/infatuation, an overprotective grandmother caretaker who doesn't know what to do, etc.Was it interesting? Not for everyone. Was it funny? A little. Was it inspirational or introspective? Not for me."
3,Seat Protector,"This pad is a nice looking addition to any chair where you need to protect the fabric. I only wish it came in other colors, not just brown. It now resides on a brown chair in our home."
3,More Annoyed than Impressed,"When we moved to a small rural town, we discovered that cable service was not available, and our only choice was between Directv or Dish. We chose the Directv and purchased the receiver and dish set from RCA. So far we have been less than thrilled with the product. The remote control lasted about three weeks and then about half of the buttons went dead. But even before it died, it was difficult to use. Besides that, the people at Directv keep calling us on a regular basis to sell us a more expensive package, which we don't want, but they keep on calling anyway. I think, if I had it to do over again, I would've gone with Dish instead."
5,Great Book,"This is an excellent book - well written, and makes some of the very difficult material very understandable. Examples are good, and it actually shows the derivations of all the formulae."
2,Great sound - poor performance,Quality of the recorded sound is outstanding.I personally do not like the interpretation and would not care to hear this recording again.
5,"Great massage table, great manufacturer too","The table was delivered in a few days with a little cut on the otherwise flawless surface, obviously made during UPS delivery (there was a cut on a box as well). I called the manufacturer, they immediately sent me a replacement, which came without any delivery defects. The table itself is very sturdy, great quality. I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase."
3,"Worth the money, sort of.","It is a little cumbersome to quickly set up and take down and store, but that is not a complaint since I do want something sturdy, and sturdy requires bulk and close tolerances. Size and cushion work well. Adjustmenst are adequate. My only beef is that the head rest is difficult to use and get comfortable. I don't know if it is just me or the design. Naturally, I prefer the hole in the table over the extension to the table for a face relief. It is my first table, and I really can't say if it is better or worse than any."
1,Unconvincing,"Slow, unconvincing, self-congratulatory, not recommended. There. All my thoughts on this book in five words."
2,Not for group or public use,"Not for group or public use.Our set is set up in our front lobby, and we have jokers who come by, turn on the set, play with the controls until they are in the menu, and then we have to call in a repair technician to get the set back into factory settings.The setup for this TV is not user friendly, P52921, and the menus are hard to read, easy to get lost in, and a pain to return to use.Next is obtaining the user manual from the RCA Website. Need the manual for that too.Finally is the price. I have priced several LCD HDTVs at far less than $1400.00"
1,Turbo Tax Deluxe 2002,"I have used this product with complete success for the past five years. Not this year! After spending many frustrating hours attempting to load this program, I gave up. Whatever changes made for this years version has made it a nightmare to activate. The illegal operation prompt continues to appear and as for technical support... there is none!"
1,Avoid Intuit at all costs,"This product frequently leads to ""illegal operation"" and there is no phone support.The live Chat feature does not work and the advertised Free state is a 29.95 charge that you then need to seek a refund for later.Awful, is my rating !"
1,Very Poor Design for Clipping Receiver onto Mouse,"Pros: Very smooth and accurate mouse. Good, quality feel. As accurate as a corded mouse. Simple to use and install--just plug the little receiver into your computer's USB port and Windows XP immediately recognizes it--and your clicking away.Cons: Very poor design for clipping the receiver to the mouse. The receiver clips onto the bottom of the mouse by means of a small plastic button. This action is what turns off the mouse's power to save the battery. The problem is that the plastic button is flimsy and doesn't inspire any confidence that it would stay on if jostled during travel. And if the receiver happens to pop off the mouse, the mouse's power turns on. Then when you need your mouse the next time, it's dead. Also, if the little receiver pops off it could be lost--then you've really got a problem. I wish I would have bought a mouse with a more secure way of stashing the receiver and a more secure way of turning it on and off."
4,"Great mouse, but no carry bag included",I like this mouse alot its not too big or too small its perfect.
1,never buy used idems from amazon,I bought this used logitech wireless mouse V200 from Amazon a month ago. I only used it several times. Today it stopped working! My computer told me that USB device had malfunctioned! I wasted $30 on something that was supposed to be USED- LIKE NEW item and satisfaction guaranteed! I doubt I will ever buy anything from Amazon
2,"worst mouse I have ever had and I had about 25 bad, bad",This mouse does not work unless you have a lot of time. It works but not smooth. The click works off and on. I had a lot of mice but this one is the bottom of the barrel. Save your money and buy a good pencel.
4,Great mouse not so great design,"The Logitech V200 Cordless Blue mouse worked right out of the box. I didn't have to install any of the included software and it started working as soon as I plugged in the receiver. The only downside to the mouse is the design of the snap-on receiver. It is not very secure, so if you don't have a dedicated pocket in your laptop case for the mouse, the receiver can fall off easily and get lost in your bag. For the price though, this is a great mouse, for travel or otherwise."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT,"I purchased a new Dell laptop in Feb; therefore, I wanted a new mouse to go with my new computer. The first mouse I purchased was a Kensington which was a very bad choice. Then I purchased the red Logitech V200 which has worked perfectly on my Dell Vista computer. Tonight I had to purchase another Logitech mouse because my husband was using my mouse and I don't want to share it!! His mouse will be the blue that way they can not get mixed up. I just love this mouse!!!"
3,Red mouse.,"Cute mouse, but too sensitive for me. Not very good for gaming AT ALL!!Mouse is also heavy and not easily moved around when quick movements are needed. I'll stick with corded optical mice."
4,Good mouse!,"Size is right, not too small; use AA bettery, can be turn off by attaching the receiver to the mouse; the optic signal is soft, and tracking is OK; horizontal wheel can be customized; never has wireless issueThe cons are: a little bit heavy, partly due to the 2 AA bettery used; the middle button has limited functionsOverall, this one should be recommended. But if you get the bluetooth, there is another Logitech BT mouse with nearly same size, but without receiver."
5,Good game for communication,This games provides a way to learn a lot about your significant other in a non invasive way. I play this game while driving and I learn a lot about my boyfriend.
3,Surprise!,"The concept is good, and the questions for us (a couple) are reasonable, but we aren't having any ""fun"" yet. Deck 1 is supposed to be fun and funny -- it's not. We're a little concerned about the seriousness of deck 2."
1,Don't buy it.,More than half of the tracks have horrible sound. Much better sounding cd's out there.
3,hour better spent in the gym,"Did you know that running can increase your stamina for sex or that doing push-ups can help you hold yourself up? If you're a complete couch potato and don't know anything about exercise, this DVD might be useful for you. If you already have a regular weight and cardio routine, just stick with it, don't neglect your trunk and core exercises, and pass on the DVD."
1,Too small,"Unless you have the very thinnest yoga mat or a very short one, it will not fit in this bag."
5,WOW!,This stereo is awesome. I have been looking for something to replace my old boom box for years and when I saw this I immediately checked it out. Thsi stereo has wonderful bass but it's not so overpowering you can't hear anything else. The clear sound is excellent and the two speakers (set up at correct angles) give the perfect surround sound. If you want to you may want to get a couple more speakers but you don't miss to much if you decide not to buy them. All in all this is a terrific stereo for half the price of one that's not even as good!
