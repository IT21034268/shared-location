3,"Good Job, needs more detail","Alpah Male is a catchy title and a decent book, but needs more detail in terms of providing acrtual training routines. Could use an upgraded nutrition section as most of the info in the entire book, while good, needs greater explanation"
4,well-priced,"Compared to other products out there, this is one of the better priced ones. In all honesty, though, I can't tell the difference between this an a more expensive product. I don't see any changes on my skin other than I have more acne now, which could just be circumstantial and due to the pollution in the city."
3,Not bad,But I switched to Olay Serum - only because I'm not a 20 year any more :)Thing face treatment IS actually good.
5,Fantastic!,I switched from my usual olay complete to this product and I couldnt be happier. Just the texture alone is enough to bring me back. I highly recommend!
3,Too good to be true,This product was exactly what it was advertised to be ...but the pump in this was broken and I feel it that should've been stated..otherwise the product was fantastic I just had to fiddle around to make it work by switching a working pump from and old product
4,"Effective, but not overpowering","I ordered this because I like the sandalwood shaving soap I ordered from Taylor of Old Bond Street,Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounceand it was reasonably priced compared to other options. It seems to be doing its job as a deodorant, and has not resulted in any irritation as I have experienced with some others I have used. The scent is much more subtle than the TOBS shaving soap, which I appreciate. The scent of the shaving soap abates soon after the shave has been completed, and the deodorant is not so overpoweringly scented that it announces your arrival before you enter the room."
2,"Eagerly anticipated, greatly disappointed.","As a student of Japanese culture and history, I was eagerly turned to the first page of Cloud of Sparrows and was hooked. However, as the story progressed, I grew increasingly frustrated. The author (clever use of the name ""Genji"") had ample opportunity to develop the characters, but concentrated, instead, on detailing the battle scenes. The characters were two-dimensional and left me feeling deprived and disappointed. His descriptions of the countryside, however, were enticing, and I look forward to another visit to Japan."
4,Entertaining,"This one plays well to American audiences for its romanticized images of the Samurai of the late 1800's. Plus, it throws in the East meets West convention, which is always interesting. I enjoyed his parallels. His character development was pretty good, i thought. Good exposition, though the pacing suffered a bit for it. Also, the fact that he borrowed liberally from Herbert, I found interesting. I wouldn't take this one too seriously as an historical novel, but good first time attempt by the author."
4,Good Read - But no shogun,"This is a surprisingly good read, especially considering that it is the author's first novel. I can NOT, however, be comared to Shogun.The time period (right at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate) that the book is set in is an interesting one and it contrasts favorably to the time period in Shogun. Matsuoka also does not use fictionalized names for real historical figures. Matsuoka also does an excellent job of describing the future through a mid nineteenth century samurai's visions.On the bad side, the characterization seems forced and is typical of beginning novelists. Plot points also seem contrived at times; such as one character traveling all the way to Japan from the United States to avenge a murder. How did he know his target went to Japan? Additionally, the characters use modern phrases that no one from that time period used.All in all, a pretty good book."
4,Exciting debut!,"I was expecting zero from this book and got an exciting, action-packed novel that I thoroughly enjoyed. Many of the reader reviews here seem to be damning the author for not having written Shogun. Well, for a first novel, this one is damn good. James Clavell wasn't the James Clavell who wrote Shogun at the start of his career either, so cut this guy some slack. Mr. Matsuoka is good enough now for this very strong novel and I expect he'll only get better. Very enjoyable read."
3,Seriously Overrated,"This novel does not live up to its marketing hype. The story is not that good, and it is a very hard read. Also, the amount of unnecessary gore in this book is enough to make a Marine puke. I found this novel to be testimony to the continuing inability of the publishing industry to get it right. Why do these addle-brained New York editors think an American would enjoy this story, told mainly and violently from a Japanese perspective? Maybe it's selling in Japan, but given its low sales rank on Amazon.com, it's obviously not selling in the good ole U.S.A. And for good reason."
2,Implausible and a difficult read,"I fell for the marketing hype and bought this new novel. I didn't think I was going to get another ""Shogun"", but I did think I would be getting a good read. Instead the book turned out to be very difficult to read...definitely not a page turner.The editor spent too much time trying to make the prose avant garde by adding all kinds of literary devices. Instead of the desired effect, it just tires the reader. The plot also had too many baroque elements to it. The idea of a Western gunfighter in Japan was laughable and totally absurd. Also, it was kind of silly to make Genji somehow clairvoyant. I honestly don't see how this book ever got published by Delacorte Press."
2,Not well-researched at all,"The thing I liked about Shogun and Clavell's other works was the detailed research effort that went into each novel. I'm afraid Matsuoka doesn't deliver on the same level. He basically co-opts Clavell's Gai-Jin plot and then tries to overlay a real 17th Century Japanese historical event, the pivotal Battle of Sekigihara, onto the late Tokugawa landscape. I'm afraid it doesn't work for me or anyone else who knows history, since the samurai were almost gone by the time of the late Tokugawa shogunate. The same can be said for Stark, the American gunfighter who comes to Japan to hunt down a ruthless American desperado, hiding out as a buddhist monk no less! Ha! Ha! Excuse me, but I just have to laugh at this improbable nonsense. Add to that, Lord Genji's strange psychic abilities and you've got the makings of a good soap opera, or anime movie, but not an historical action adventure. The other reviewers said it best: James Clavell remains the undisputed master of this genre."
1,Orff :Carmina Barana,The music would be wonderful if the transcription were not so bad. My original order and a replacement both displayed alternate periods of inaudability and intolerable loudness. I would like to receive a corrected recording.
2,Disappointing,"Alyssa's lack of clothing maybe the only redeeming feature of this film. I love vampire flicks, which was my second reason for buying this. But i was sad to find out that there isn't a good story behind it. Martin Kemp (Spandau Ballet/Eastenders) give a strained performance , but with such a bad script who can blame him. If you like the supernatural and Alyssa, watch ""Charmed"", she may keep her clothes on but at least you won't wear out the fast forward on your remote."
3,Alyssa fans only.,"There is only one reason to purchase this movie, you are a Alyssa Milano worshiper. She did what she could with the poor writing but thats not the selling point. Alyssa doing soft-core is worth the price of the movie. The only thing that could make the movie better would be to replace all of the non-Alyssa-naked-scenes with Alyssa-naked-scenes. If you are looking for a movie with a compelling story or competent acting, look someplace else. This is an Alyssa-ogoling movie and nothing else."
2,"Not as good as any random episode of ""Charmed.""","Despite its cult reputation owing to Alyssa Milano's frequent nude scenes, ""Embrace of the Vampire"" is unfortunately not as satisfying as any random episode of ""Charmed."" And don't rent this expecting to see Jennifer Tilley, who has only a tiny five-minute cameo"
1,Dissapointing Photo Frame,"While the frame looks good, the software is horrible and the power plug is delicate & unreliable."
1,"John Lenski Richmond Hill, NY","Believe me, a one star rating is generous! I've seen some bad B horror and science fiction movies in my time and this one has to rank among the worst. It comes close to Plan Nine from Outer Space, as the worst movie ever released. Poor Bela Lugosi! This movie proves the fact that a drug addict will do anything to get a fix. These type of movies do have a hypnotic effect in that you keep watching because you can't believe how bad it is until at last the horror is over."
1,A Federally-Funded Tautology?,"The federal government funded this ""empirical"" study of the ""choices"" available to those who have filed for bankruptcy.The principal finding? People who file for bankruptcy are broke. A true revelation.So where is Senator Proxmire when you need him?"
1,bad...,"This ramp is bad quality, when i got it i couldn't find the nails. But that's not the bad part. When i was going off it it slid forward it made me lose my balance so i smacked my face against the ground and cut my lip and sprained my wrist. Don't waste your time looking at this ramp."
4,Used as an RC Truck Jump.,"This works excellent as a RC truck jump. I use it with my Team Losi Mini-LST 1/18 scale RC truck, much nicer than a scrap wood jump. Just the perfect width for this wheelbase."
1,"Too, too small","This may be an acceptable ramp for a child 6-8, but an older child would laugh at this one. I was embarrassed to even give it to my son!"
1,Misleading advertisement,There was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts. My son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road. He could not. It is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface.
2,The Thunder of Silence,"While this book has some valuable things to say about meditation and getting silent enough to hear our inner self and spiritual guidance, it is so wordy and convoluted that it is very difficult to read."
1,Too short to connect!,"The USB connection is too short to connect to my Dell laptop. I contacted Lexar and they are looking into the matter and offering me an exchange. Also, cannot find the Private Browsing software/option."
2,Letdown,"Not that I was expecting ""the next biggest thing"" but I had hoped for a fun, light summer read. What I got what a dull book that I had to force myself to finish. Every now and then I like reading a ""beach read"".. something that's fun and flirty like The Devil Wears Prada or anything by Sophie Kinsella. This book is terrible. It drags on and I really didn't find there to be too much of an story to it. Pass on this one."
2,"Readable, But Bad","The Nannie Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada, The Ivy Chronicles... The Botox Diaries joins a long list of chick lit with the theme ""aren't rich people crazy and amusing?"" The twist is that this novel focuses on a forty something women.Unfortunately, The Botox Diaries brings nothing new to the table. The novel is poorly plotted, completely lacking in cohesion. Did the authors outline the plot beforehand, or did they just make it up as they went along?The main character is not nearly as funny or charming as she's supposed to be, and the main character's best friend is downright unlikeable. Nobody would be best friends with someone who doesn't listen to your problems, is completely self centered, and puts you in compromising positions.The hot French ex-husband of the main character speaks tenth grade French throughout the novel. This is really a minor point, but it bothered me.The ending is insulting to the reader's intelligence.Skip this book and spend your money on something better."
2,Don't waste your time...,I have never offered one of these reader reviews but disliked this book so much (not hated--but strongly disliked) that I felt compelled to do so. It is so terribly predictable and flashy in all the wrong ways. Wow a single Mom with an adopted daughter who meets celebs/gets wooed by a very rich frenchman/is allowed to borrow a Chanel dress from the showroom in NY/gets bought Tiffany earrings on a whim/goes on a TV dating show and somehow never has her daughter around at just the right moments is almost insulting to read (read: so totally unbelievable)... this is chick lit at its worst. It seems contrived and very intentional in all the wrong ways.
3,"Unrealistic comedy, not to be taken seriously","The situations described in this book are very unrealistic, specially the gay surfer (a moron), however, some parts are realistic like some moneyed women ogling younger men and trying to have them as toys or side dishes because of boredom in their marriage. But women in their 40s, not rich and really working hard to raise kids will have very little or nothing to do with these women that has money and time to waste in silly things, the so-called society women. Most women described here are vain and have time and money to enact the middle-age crisis.Women in the working class are too busy for this crisis and shows of freakness."
1,So Cliche!,"I usually only feel compelled to write reviews for books that move me. Well, this one certainly did--to the bathroom to THROW UP! This insultingly unintelligent book is chock-full of every cliche known to man (or should I say woman). From leg-humping dogs to French dreamboats, The Botox Diaries is about as cleverly written as a fart joke. As an avid reader, I try to finish a book even if I don't like it. Well, there is an exception to every rule! What a waste of time!"
2,Predictable,"I found this book to be a catchy title, sloppily written with many cliches. Could be a good bus read, but the advertisements may be more inventive."
1,"Really, really bad!...Just BAD....","I think the great reviews are the authors' friends, parent, editors...etc. This book is so dumb and boring it's unbelievable that anyone over 16 would be entertained by it. It is NOT ""funny"", or ""sexy"" or ""fresh"". It is contrived and cliche-riddled and dull as dirt. Also, the writing has a strange aged quality to it. I am pushing 40 and so are my friends, but the women in this book sound like our moms (60+). No hip woman in NYC EVER wears panty hose! EVER. And only dated old fuddy-duddies say ""Blue Jeans"". Those are just a couple of eye-rolling offenses I could remember as I forgot most of this forgettable drivel the second I put it down"
2,Tries way too hard....,"My overall impression of the book is that the authors are trying WAY too hard to be funny. Literally, every other sentence is some sort of joke and it's annoying as can be! Other reviewers have commented on this and say that it takes away from the plot line. Honestly, the plot line is as weak as the authors' poor attempt at humor.I really had to force myself to complete the book because I refused to give up on something so unintelligent that it took virtually no thinking to read.If the book would have skipped its continual attempt of humor, I may be able to recommend it, but then, it would probably only be 10-pages. Don't get me wrong, I love books that make me laugh, and I do have a sense of humor, but this was an insult to those with a sense of humor.I give this book two stars instead of only one, because a few of the characters are somewhat charming. Unfortunately, each one is stereotypical so this is only surface level charm."
4,"Great, but not the best","I do think this book is great, but I've read better(like Samantha's Pride). I love how playful Sierra is,(although Sierra is a girls name) and how much trouble he causes. But I know from previous books that that is not how Mike acts. He's always a lot nicer. And I don't like how the author casts Pride aside to put Sierra in the spotlight. Overall, it's a pretty good book."
1,Waste of my time,"This book was nothing but a waste of time. Samantha is annoying and I don't care about Sierra. So he won a steeplechase, big deal. I like racing better, not steeplechasing. More of the T.B. Series should be about racing, not stupid eventing or steeplechasing. And another thing, isn't Sierra a GIRL name? And Sierra is a BOY! So if you haven't read this book, don't read it."
3,For my model but doesnt fit well,I have the panny vacuum Panasonic MCUG471 and this belt makes noise from running wrong in my model. The belt is a tad thicker then old one must be the difference.It states on panny package of belt it fits my vacuum but it doesnt.I use it but its a pain.
3,Food for the logical.,"The Christian ""leap of faith"" based belief system takes a flying leap in this book by John Shelby Spong. Some parts have an intense venomous and brisk style while not all parts are fully cogent. In one example, Spong spends pages arguing that the premise of an ancient taxation plan which required descendants to return to their ancestral homeplace was preposterous and could not have ever been conceived in the ancient world. However, he seems to have forgotten that those tales were indeed derived from ancient writings. Spong's book requires a leap of faith too in certain portions, but overall his intent is good and sound. The best compliment that one can give to any book is that it made you think. Yes, Jesus for the Non-Religious does."
4,Godology,"This book is properly titled, and not written for anyone who is religious, or fully immersed in their beliefs. Along with ""Honest to God"" by J.T. Robinson, and ""Jesus Now"" by a former Priest, I think this fits very well into a sequence of books that attempt to make Jesus relevant to people in a time period that is 2000 years removed from his life on earth. Bishop Spong follows a path that dates back to the German theologians who recognized that New Testament myth has been accepted as true history by most mainline Christians. The canonical books were chosen in an attempt to prove the humanity and divinity of Jesus at a crucial time in the history of the church. He strips away the miraculous claims with an appeal to reason, while maintaining that Jesus is still relevant to faith in God. Anyone who has trouble reconciling his beliefs with what the Church expects, will find this book helpful and provocative."
5,Religious,"Again, I have had wonderful luck with ordering from book owners on Amazon. The book was mailed and arrived in the stated amount of time and in wonderful condition. Cuddos to you!!!!!"
4,provocative,"This book presented ideas I had never considered before, especially concerning God. I had always accepted the general Christian religion view of a personal God to whom we could pray and seek to know his presence and seek his guidance. This book has caused me to rethink my previous views and at this stage I am unsure of where I stand. I am not a literalist concerning the bible, but the book goes much further than my previous view of the bible. The logical presentation of the book is very convincing."
3,Good set of mostly ballads,"Misty and Hipty Hop, the first two selections, are great. Then this one runs out of steam."
2,Not up to par,"Sorry :( Up to now I have loved John's books. Could not complete this one, but I will keep looking forward to his books to come. Guess everyone can have an off book :)"
4,An Almost Bipolar Album,"""Working Classical"" is a stunning collection of neo-classical tunes. I have not listened to ""Liverpool Oratorio"" or ""Standing Stone,"" but what I hear in this work is transcendent.The music can go to the extremes of soothing deep passages or erratic fast movements, but the large majority is spent in the former. The pieces are usually slow and moving, quite beautiful. One must admit, however, that some of them do this to the point of being fearfully dull. McCartney has endued the music with such passion, though: whenever I listen to some of it, I almost feel depths of depression wash over me.McCartney is a truly gifted composer, as is no doubt proven by this glorious work. I would recommend it to any classical fan who doesn't think there are reincarnations of the style today (albeit some or most of the pieces have a pop edge to them)."
4,Striking contrasts,"I liked a lot of ""Liverpool Oratorio"" (especially the ""toti mundo"" beginning and the end) and I thought parts of ""Standing Stone"" were very evocative (again, the ""I will stay with you"" ending), but the short original pieces here are much more suitable to Paul's talents. Something about the melody of ""Spiral"" is very haunting, in the best McCartney tradition. Listen to this recording and then listen to ""Run Devil Run,"" released virtually at the same time. Is any other musician capable of delivering two such convincing recordings in such completely opposite styles?"
5,For the Long Haul,"What makes for an enduring marriage? My reading of Mimi Schwartz is that a portion of wry detachment comes in handy. Unlike so many women of her (and my) generation who have abandoned a marriage or two on the way to professional success and personal fulfillment, Schwartz has stuck with her Stu, and he with her, and these essays often give off a bit of the tension that underlies such give and take. My standards for good memoir rest more on the quality of reflection than on the drama of the incidents,and Schwartz is a sharp observer of the everyday. But there is plenty of shadow here, most prominently her father's narrow escape from the Holocaust, a family historic event that left her not only cognizant of calamity but grateful for good fortune.Would I recommend this book for newly-weds? Maybe after the first big fight. The more battle-scarred among us will applaud the couples' continuing attraction to each other."
5,A Winner Handsdown!,"This guy's vocals are so startlingly close to the real King's voice and exhibit a range that even Orion couldn't match ....It's eerie to listen to and gives you an idea of what Elvis *could* have done ....What sets this collection apart from other attempts is the high value of the musical production, it's exquisite to say the least thanks to Bap Kennedy who produced the album!There's only one snag here: the American ARK 21 release contains a mere 11 songs, while the original German EMI 1998 release boasts 18 tracks (and is still available)!Different country versions of ""Gravelands"" even featured additonal bonus songs such as ""Riders on the storm"", ""Suicide Blonde"", or ""Come as you are (JAPANESE version)"".The King released a follow-up album ""Return to splendor"" in 2000...."
4,Great follow up,"If you liked ""the lonely position"", chances are, you'll like this one too (1 2). Trust company is a perfect blend of hard rock and smooth, melodic vocals, and had they added a cheesy rapper to the set, they'd be as big as linkin park (the saddest ""rock"" band on the face of the earth, next to good charlotte). No hip-hop influence or turntables here, just straight-ahead, modern rock with a slightly more melodic sound. And the best part is, they'll probably never be seen at #1 on mtv countdowns or billboard charts. Pick up ""true parallels"" if you want some well produced, catchy rock, with enough hard edge and soft melody to even things out. 4 1/2 out of 5 (only because I liked ""the lonely position"" a tad bit better)."
3,A Fall Off From First Album,"Just a quick review for this follow-up CD. Most, but certainly not all, songs seem to be shallow and lacking. Almost as if this effort was rushed out the door without a final quality check. If I could give half stars, I would have rated this CD as 2 1/2 stars. Not bad, but not TRUSTcompany's best work."
4,Incredible Album,"Wow! what can I say about this album? it gives me chills. Not many bands can put out a good sophomore album, but these guys did. this album is so great, it may just be better than the first. Big tracks include..Fold, Crossing The Line, Someone Like You, Heck..all the songs are amazing. The L.L.T (Least Liked Track) for me would be breaking down..it's a good song, but I think it's the weakest song on the album..overall, a must have. They didn't change anything from the last album, which is good, why mess with a good thing? if it works, stick with it. They have the same sound, with Kevin Palmer's whispery voice..which I must say he has one of the best and most unique voice out there. Completely awesome. I get chills when I listen to this record."
3,1st on was better,"This one is ok...nothing to catchy in my book. The first one was way better! I couldnt stop listening to it. THis one, I find myself changing cd's after a few songs!"
1,PikStik,"I actually purchased this to help in pulling weeds that were inside a giant pumpkin patch, which we didn't want to step into (trying not to compress the soil). The PikStik is not able to hold the weed and pull it out. Wasn't sure if it would work or not - now we know."
3,Not strong enough to pull blinds closed,"This thing has good reach and is ergonomically sound, but I couldn't get the clasp to grip the cords of some high-up wood blinds I wanted to open/close. The cord is not that difficult to pull manually, so I'm disappointed that this gripper could not do the job."
4,Great Book For Beginner Coach,This book was very resourceful for my coaching needs. I am coaching a girls YBall Team for 6th grade. I needed some drills to advance their knowledge and skills for the game. THe first 50 pages gave me everything I have needed for this level. I would recomend that you try a few of the drills yourself before trying them with the kids. Since due to my players lower skill level a few have proven to be too difficult. But Overall this was a saving grace for me. I didn't have time to go out and buy a book and I was able to download to my kindle!! Yeah!
1,Much less than I expected,"I was very disappointed with this one. In the introduction, the author reminds us that any games or activities must be relevant to the subject. Unfortunately, I saw very few activities that I could use as-is in my workshops. They would take too much time of a two-hour workshop for little return, or seemed to have little point at all. I saw a few I could adapt to the content of my parent and/or teacher early childhood workshops."
2,Souless playing by Perlman,"At the time of Le Quattro Stagioni's conception, Vivaldi was maestro de' concerti at an all-girl's orphanage. Each year, the orphanage would hold nurmous concerts where adolescent girls would play violin behind a curiously shaded curtain.Op. 8 not only remains one of Vivaldi's greatest masterpiece, but is reflective of the mastro de' concerti at his most musical and creative stage. To play such a passionate, flawless piece of music as Perlman did is, to say the least, insufficient. Perlman's techique and intonation are flawless, but behind that there is nothing else. Tempos drag (especially in the presto movement of Summer), and the dynamics are forced (listen to Winter's 1st movement). Perlamn renders this great piece of music to mere finger exercises, and does diservice to such a great piece of music. I recommand Janine Jansen's account of the reviewed album."
5,"""Flabbergaster""","I found this novel a delightful and interesting read. The inclusion of Buddhist spirituality, an amazingly international array of characters (even a Chinese Muslim (Uighur) tavernkeeper), and emphasis on the Native American experience, make this novel deeper and more meaningful than most other novels set in the American West. Though the plot is intriguing, the novel is at its best in depicting its colorful and diverse characters (Taylor, buoyant half-Indian, with a passion for music, who pairs up with Sun moon, beautiful Tibetan nun)and settings, from a Digger Indian village to Mormon Utah. Despite its realistic depictions of the racism and violence of the period, the story remains light-hearted and humorous. Sir Richard Burton, Nile explorer and drug addict, was particularly enjoyable. It would have been more interesting if his Sufi beliefs were explored a bit further, but of course he was somewhat of a side character."
4,Great vocals and music.,I bought this CD based on the other ones that I have loved. I can play them and get just as transported to another culture as before. The quality of her vocals and the impeccable musicianship of the other members carries me there. My only disapointment in this CD is that too much of it is in English. I like World Music.
4,Excellent Introduction to New Testament Greek,"As a first year Greek student, I found Mounce's large tome on Introductory Greek, with its verbosity and endless depth, to be extremely intimidating. In my opinion, Black avoids such stumbling blocks for the new Greek student, while offering many outlets and resources for the more advanced student as well. Although there were several places in which my own brilliant Greek professor (Dr. Roy Metts) had to adjust and/or replace Black's instruction (e.g., Black's classification system for Third Declension Nouns is somewhat cumbersome), my opinion of this text remains positive and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning the basics of biblical Greek.(P.S. Broadman and Holman's printing company did a terrible job in the binding of this book. Almost everyone I know who owns this book has had the pages separate from the binding within a few months. Be prepared to glue it back together!)"
4,Monster island,"It was really good. The beginning is a little slow but that is only a couple of chapters. The characters are also easy to relate to if you like zombie stuff in general. And the idea behind some of the ""new"" zombie twist is actually really nice."
4,Good entry in the genre,"This one's all about setting and individual attacks. NYC landmarks are worked into the narrative in a very engaging way, and the battles use a fascinating variety of impromptu weapons and tactics - RPG, flare gun, homemade bombs, a tottering pyramid of zombies standing on each other's shoulders. A quick, thrilling read."
2,Terrible,"Another bad zombie book in a long line of bad zombie books. The idea was fine, but the writing was dreadful. Hollow characters compounded by a complete lack of style. The author needs to take a few writing classes and work on sentence structure, grammar, and punctuation. I really wish more decent writers would get into the zombie genre. By the way, I would still have bought the book after reading my review since my zombie addiction is so severe. Just thought I would throw that in."
3,Complex for a zombie thriller,"I got the whole trilogy and read them in order thankfully. The writing style seemed a bit complex compared to other ""undead"" based books I have read.The trilogy one was more in depth and had a supernatural flavor to it. I was looking for a brain-smashing mindless zombie book but this one gave me a different experience. I feel indifferent as it did not satisfy my mindless need for human on zombie violence.I would definitely read all 3 of the books to get full satisfaction but if you have not read ANY zombie books read this one first so you are not ""disappointed"" that it is not similar to the other undead books out there.If you want brain-bashing go elsewhere but if you want interesting characters and a departure from the norm this is a great book."
3,Kind of random plot devices,"Monster Island is a well-paced and enjoyable read, but I found some of the plot a little too over the top. Some elements reminded me a little of Stephen King's The Cell, such as the zombies gathering and telepathy. There are definately better zombie novels out there."
3,Zombies! In New York City! Run!!,This is a good addition to the zombie genre. I don't know of many if any other zombie novels set in New York City. I especially liked the scene when the characters are cowering in the Virgin record store off Union Square as the undead try to get in.This is certainly not the best literature that I have ever read but then nor is it meant to be. As with Monster Nation - Wellington's prequel to this book - the characters can be a little flat at times. Some of their actions and decisions don't ring true and seemed to be made to very obviously push the story in the direction the author wants to go. The book does keep you engaged though and the moves along at quite a pace.Worth reading for the various apocalyptic scenes all across New York.
4,Heart & Soul Review,"After a cheerleading stunt goes wrong, Melanie is rushed to the hospital. She wakes up after a while and is constantly seeming to think she likes Peter.Jenna finally has her own room away from Maggie! She starts to get slightly jealous of Peter and Melanie when the two visit Melanie's house and is shocked to find Caitlin, her older sister, upset.Nicole arrives with Courtney, Leah and Melanie for the modeling contest in St. Louis. Someone mistakes Leah for a contestant and Nicole begs Leah to enter, who agrees. Nicole is scared to death on stage but Leah could barely have cared less--and wins the contest because of it."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"One of the worst buying experiences in my life. I just burned out my 4th set of bulbs, after buying the original set 7 months ago. I've paid for shipping to and from Plasmaglow each time, filled out the paperwork, and wasted hours and hours mailing them back to Plasmaglow. These bulbs lasted between 3 - 7.5 weeks, not months, not years. 40 years worth of warranty, but I can barely get 40 days worth of life out of them. I am an aircraft mechanic for 24 years, I am installing them correctly, but the filaments keep burning out in the exact same spot. They are deamed faulty by the company, and after I pay shipping both ways, a fill out the paperwork then they'll send me a new set. They refuse to help me, now that I refuse to keep paying their postage! They won't answer my voicemails, emails, etc... This company in horrible, do not deal with them!!"
1,"Don't buy these, I want my money back.","What a waste of money, I'm very disappointed . These bulbs have no blue tint at all. They Look like my stock bulbs. They SUCK!!"
5,Movie was hilarious!,I thought the first one was funny...ha. Plus the video quality on Amazon.com is great. I highly recommend using Amazon.com
1,Just Plain Crude,"Eddie Murphy is undoubtedly a talented man. I do give him credit for attempting to play nearly all the characters in this film. However, the humor is regulated for the stinkiest toilet. This movie lives off of a fart jokes and crude sexual innuendo. And the caricatures of the Klumps are grossly over exaggerated to the point wehre its disgusting and even racially offensive. The first Nutty Professor was good as the Klumps were a side bar issue which was fine in its limited dosage. This version does reaks of crass low class humor."
4,Very helpful book,"This book takes you line by line through drawing cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Some are relatively simple, others complex. It is not perhaps an excellent way to learn to draw, but it will help you get a feel for drawing. It also has good explanations for the quartered wheel technique of circles. All in all a pretty good buy for the price-if cars, trucks, and motorcycles are what you want to draw."
5,Varathane - good,"I heard about this from another craft person, who used it for clay beads. I looked for it in the store but they only had giant buckets, and i do not need that much for crafts. This polish is exactly what i need - dries fast, washes of the brushes with just water, water-based, no smell, dries super fast, very glossy."
2,The Best of Bud and Travis,"Your service was excellent, I got it zap!zoom!, and I like Bud and Travis very much, especialmente en Espanol. However, the sound quality on some of the tracks left much to be desired - probably the condition of the master. Is it at all possible that you would exchange this CD for the one that is all in Spanish? Anyway, I have bought from you before, and will again. Thanx, Bonnie Blankenship"
3,Oxford Picture Dictionary: English/Spanish,"The Disctionary is OK,I think its more for Spanish people learning English, but its usefull for me anyway.The delivery was in time.Thank you."
1,"Not Goat medicine, Theory Only",This book is not for practical use. I could not find any information on real medicine. The definition of medicine to me is the corrective and preventive care for the health of the Animal. This book gave a lot of useless high flown theory. Even the section on poison plants liste all of the plants with only the botanical names of the plants. I had to check out a plant names book from the local library to identify the plants.This book deserves no stars and does not belong in the medicine catagory. Even a Vet that I took this book to for advice said that it was useless
1,Highly Dissatisfied,"I really do not like this version of an otherwise excellent body of work. I thought that the ""house"" version of this work did a great disservice to the brillance of this classic work. I know that this may have been an attempt to make the genius of this artist relevant to a younger audience, but sometimes it's better for the younger to appreciate and embrace the work of the elder."
4,Book Alone,"I bought the book used here sans cards and the book itself is interesting. It has about five references to the wonderful writer Julie Smith whose work I'm reading now as a result. She's terrific and until now I had not considered myself a mystery reader.A few of the topics/ideas in the are common sense (well, actually they all are), but I am surprised at how having them in one place is inspirational. I wish I had this book on my writer's retreat last weekend for a craft lesson presentation.The edition I have is a small paperback and has a colorful, interesting cover. It would make a great gift.So, in short, I recommend the book as a gift for writer friends or for yourself to nurture your creative side. I'm so torn between the two, I'll buy another copy."
3,Not very clear and heavier than expected.,"This item is a perfect size for an adult long-haired hamster but it is not very clear - it was a bit scratched when I received it. Also, it is a little heavy for a hamster to push around."
4,Very good.Gets dirty very quickly,"I bought this hamsters ball thinking it wouldnt smudge, but it did.But my hamster like it so im happy with it"
3,My gerbils just don't like run around balls in general so...,"I bought my gerbils when they were already adults, so perhaps they can't really get used to the run around ball. This is the second I've purchased, but for both balls they run around a bit then stop and don't move anymore. I think that maybe if a gerbil starts out running in balls from a young age, they'll learn to love the exercise, but my gerbils are perfectly content in the very large glass tank they live in and spend lots of time on their gerbil wheel. If I ever buy gerbils that are younger, hopefully they would like a run around ball, but not my current ones. There was nothing wrong with the ball, just my gerbils apparently :P"
5,Perfect for a large hamster!,Me and Oreo (my hamster)love this 7 inch ball!The door is sturdy.Comes with a free bag of food.My hamster is huge to most people!He loves it!!!Don't leave them in for too long for they do defecate in there balls!Overall great product and I would recommend it to anyone!
3,The Worldwide debut of Claymation!,"If you like Chicken Run, and Wallace & Gromit, you will be interested in this DVD. I've never seen Gumby, but I went to the site. Prepare to make Gumby a heart of you. (That doesn't make sense)"
4,Awesome salsa video,"Video was like new, even the original receipt was attached to it. Pefect condition."
5,AWESOME BOOK-IT TOUCHES ON ALL ASPECTS OF RUG HOOKING!,"This is a great book! I have several books on rug hooking & this is the one I keep going back to. It teaches everything you need to know about rug hooking. She has many new ideas, & her rugs are gorgeous! Also included are patterns on these great rugs. A MUST read for beginners & seasoned pros alike! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
5,"Purely Primitive: Hooked Rugs from Wool, Yarn and Homespun S","This is an outstanding book! It is full of information for the beginner to the expereniced hooker. The book is full of wonderful,fun patterns."
4,Present Future,"This has to be one of the great 'explain it all' books I've ever read. Mr. McNeal doesn't pull any punches in this eye opener about Christians today and the 'great hunt' for a relationship with Jesus and God, but not necessarilly with the Church. I think he's right...everybody's making money off of the church's problems except the church....I can say this much...it has sure made me look at what Jesus meant in Matthew 16:18....'upon this rock I will build my church.' I'm beginning to wonder if Jesus was referring to a 'church' as a religion, or that he was speaking only of his 'teachings.' I'm beginning to think it was more the latter than the former."
3,"Hits the Mark, but ""Buyer Beware""","This is a well-written, well-documented treatise that is intended to rattle people. McNeal addresses a plethora of issues that plague the current day Christian Church in America. He doesn't pull punches in his delivery. His comparison of the ""organized church"" to a private club should hit many a churchgoer right between the eyes, and sad to say, if it doesn't, it only gives credence to his arguments. HOWEVER, that said, the reader must be aware that he delivers his oration from the pulpit of the ""emerging church"" culture. Some of his ideas (solutions) are as off base as the issues he is tackling. This material should be seen as run through the emerging church prism, and should not be accepted carte blanche. It would behoove the reader to do some research into the emerging church to get a feel for where McNeal is coming from."
3,51 IS NOT THAT ORIGINAL,"Be warned...51 is NOT a ""true"" After Dark original like others in the series. 51 is a SyFy channel tv movie and it shows. Unlike earlier ADO superior efforts, 51 is an amateurish attempt to cash in on the iconic legend of Area 51.Under Jason Connery's (son of 007 Sean) pedestrian direction, the plot is fairly simple: a group of reporters is inexplicably granted permission to tour the legendary Hangar 18 and upon their arrival, one of the captive aliens stages an uprising resulting in the release of other dangerous aliens.There are no CGI monsters, rather a return to the men in rubber suits circa the 1950's. Connery even allows the camera to dwell shamelessly on these creatures to further stress the low budget.B movie stalwarts Bruce Boxleitner, Jason London, Rachel Miner and John Shea try gamely but given their material, there's not much hope. And let's not forget the friendly Yoda clone---how original!51 is sort of entertaining in a quirkish way but certainly not a classic!"
3,Not Terrible.,"Okay, I am not one to enjoy Alien movies. I Like Low Budget, B Slashers. And even though this is low budget, it is about Aliens, and nothing more. Not a good addition, to the After Dark Originals. I Could see this being another sequel to ""Aliens"" Although i wasn't a big fan of this one, it is still an okay movie. You Will LOVE it, if you enjoy Alien movies. After Dark, Stick with the slashers."
2,"Well, OK, . . .","I enjoy watching coyote v. roadrunner cartoons, and thought I would enjoy this. Now I think the two may be mutually exclusive. Firstly, the coyote story is only one of several pieces in this little book. Secondly, I haven't read them all, but having read several, I'm not interested in the rest. Why did this guy think that people who like slapstick comedy would like this stuff? BTW, I graduated with a BA in English, covered with honors, and I'm currently a PhD candidate, so I don't think I'm too dumb to ""get it"". The humor in these stories just isn't evident to everyone. If it finds your funny bone, congratulations. It missed mine completely."
4,Excellent satire by Frazier,"Ian Frazier's work no longer appears in ""The New Yorker,"" which is a great pity to those of us who enjoyed his work there. His later pieces for that magazine are collected here in ""Coyote vs. Acme,"" which is worth purchasing for the title work alone. And although the essays here are somewhat more uneven than those in his earlier collection, ""Dating Your Mom"" (which I also recommend), ""Coyote vs. Acme"" is still an excellent sample of Frazier's work."
2,One Good Essay,The only essay in the whole book that I enjoyed was the Coyote vs. Acme one. That was very funny. The rest of the book was just stupid. Most of it didn't make sense at all and wasn't the least bit funny either.
1,Dont buy from them,They sent me a defective item. I wanted a replacement they wanted to charge me for shipping again back n forth. I paid $29 for the item $10 to have it shipped. They wanted to have me pay $10 to ship item back and charge me another $10 for the replacemnt. They dont have a toll free number. I just called my CC company and put stop order on the payment. The customer service is very rude.
4,Miami Vice DVD's,"Came in nice box but each dvd was not protected in the case holding them.Overall, very nice and viewing quality is great.Thanks"
5,FYI,"I was never a fan of this show, but for those of you that are, this set will be extended in amount of discs and will still contain ALL OF THE ORIGINAL MUSIC! It's a shame that Fox didn't do the same for WKRP or Paramount for Happy Days and other shows. Also, the discs are single-sided."
4,Miami Vice TV extravaganza!!,Great set...must have for Vice fans. My only complaint...probably for most others as well is the cheap two sided disc but that's the way it is. Other than that it's a awesome 5 season collection.
2,Not my cup of tea,"I'm sorry, but I was not impressed with this work at all. I love many types of music, was raised in a home filled with everything from classical to rock to country etc, etc. but for some reason, I just did not care for this. It seems forced, stilted - just not what I expected. Perhaps when I wait and listen at another time, I will have a better reaction to it."
3,Read early Irving instead,"This is early Irving lite. Go back to Setting Free the Bears, Water Method Man, 158-Pound Marriage, Garp. This may be Hagen's debut work-but there is nothing novel here."
1,Asphalt Ballet CD,This CD was a used item and when I received it the disc inside was the wrong one.I contacted the seller and they told me that they could not find the proper disc.They apologized and promptly refunded my money.They were professional and courteous and I would probably buy from them again.
1,blue light is a hazzard,"According to the Macular Degeneration organization (MDsupport.org) , blue light causes harm to the eyes. There is a large amout of info on this hazzard on the internet."
4,Nice Product,I haven't had this product real long to test it out but I really do think so far it's actually does have a positive effect per usage. I'm slowly upping the time and intensity to see if I get better results. I usually don't have a great problem until the months starting in Dec on thru the spring but I want to get a jump start before things get too bad for me.
4,"Bright, compact, and durable","This light is quite bright, casting light sky blue (ie the blue you see when you stare away from the sun on a sunny day).It's much more compact and convenient than the bulb unit I used to use, which did not fit well on my desk and was generally obtrusive. Certainly you couldn't travel with it (the GoLite comes with a travel pouch and can run on batteries, optionally).A nice testament to the GoLite's quality is that I have several times knocked it off of my desk onto a tile floor and it still works perfectly. The seams where parts join are still tightly sealed (something I wish I could say of my cell phone) and the hinged cover is just fine."
1,"Great concept, poor execution","Like the other frustrated reviewer, I found the quality of this product to be extremely poor. My first goLITE worked fine for about three weeks, then individual LEDs started burning out. I returned it for a replacement, only to find that the second unit suffered the same problem ... only within a shorter time frame. LEDs began burning out after one week of use. Perhaps this explains the short 30-day guarantee offered by the manufacturer! The quality problem is unfortunate as the product, when functioning properly, offers great relief from SAD. For my purposes, however, time to move on to another brand!"
3,Pretty but not quite right,"I bought the Lily and the Elegance. The Lily is more attractive, but the top just doesn't sit on there right. It just barely balances on top, its the same size as the bottle opening, so it doesn't fit over the top, it just sits there, and it doesn't seem to line up properly. The Elegance has a completely different kind of top, and does not have this problem."
2,Not a high quality product,"I bought this bottle because of the reasonable price, and the way it looks in the photo. However, when I received this product, I noticed that both the glass and the nozzle are of very low quality. The glass had thin, hairlike spiderweb lines on it (though not cracked), and the bottle is wobbly on the counter. The glass is also very thin. Yes, I am sure it pours oil just fine, but for a similar price I am sure you can find something better. I am returning this product, and would recommend buying a different bottle."
3,Good Jungle Sleaze!,"If your a fan of foreign cannibal exploitation horror than you may very well enjoy this movie. This ""Massacre in Dinosaur Valley"" was also known as ""Cannibal Ferrox 2"". It is actually alot better than ""Cannibal Ferrox"" but not quite as good as ""Cannibal Holocaust"". It is, of course, poorly dubbed and poorly acted as are most movies of this genre. And it suffers from poor pacing. However, it offers up plenty of cheesy gore, a very cheesy male lead, and plenty of wanton violence and nudity. It also offers the 3 sexiest female leads ever seen in any cannibal movie. Suzane Carvalho in particular is a real treat. Its no wonder the cannibals and perverts of Dinosaur Island can't keep their hands off her.."
1,CHEAP!,"I received this on a Thursday and used it the next day . The zipper separated, I used it one time. It is very cheaply made, not worth the money. I emailed the company and didn't get a response back. I will never buy anything from this seller again. The shipping was as much as the Id Holder, and it is very light. What a waste of money! So I'm out my money and an Id Holder.........."
1,Bad Paint,I had bought this rattle for my 5 month old she loved it but I had to take it off of her because the yellow paint around the inside started to peel off she had paint chips in her mouth!! I would not tell anyone to buy this product!
5,Amazing movie,One of the best and most inspiring movies ever about basketball and life. It was the first movie that made me cry.
2,not that good for first album,"ok, I think the course lines are not that good, the verses sound better then the course.The reson I gave it two stars,is because they have one good song that his track 11.but I heard the new materal for thire second album,and thire courses are relly getting better.So I have a good feeling, that thire second album is going,to be 100 times better then thire first album."
4,GMAT 2009 w/DVD Great Investment!,"I'm a 33 year old studying for both GMAT and GRE. This version of the GMAT is a very easy read, great tutorial, and at times entertaining. Before reviewing this book, I was very apprehensive, but now I'm looking foreward to taking the GMAT!"
4,Friendly and good advice book,"The tone of this book is great and so is the method. I especially recommend users register on their website and take advantage of its online practices and tests. The only thing that leaves MUCH to be desired is its DVD. It's friendly and all, but really serves little function."
5,The Best Black Genealogical Book Written,"This is the best source for black genealogy that I have read. It was an easy read and hard to put down. Mr Burroughs gave good explanations and used interesting examples. When he introduced a new concept, he explained it thoroughly and gave an example of why or why not to do whatever he was explaining. I learned a lot of good habits from this book, especially about documenting sources. If you are planning to become a professional genealogist, this book is a good beginning and an excellent reference for your genealogy library. I know I am going to buy it and have already referred several others (who are beginners to genealogy) to read it and/or purchase it."
1,Disappointing,"I've read most of Penelope Stokes' fictional works and have enjoyed them for their entertainment value and underlying lessons of faith; however, Circle of Grace was a politically correct message supporting the world's belief that a person has the ability to create his/her own heaven (on earth) and his/her own god. The few curse words sprinkled within Circle of Grace did not bother me as they were in line with the characters' makeup. However, the continual references to various ""higher powers"" and the underlying message of the lack of true ""Hope"" was very disturbing. What a disappontment to see Ms. Stokes' work has strayed far from a Christian worldview."
5,"Yikes, Scooby! It's back in print!","I would give this book 10 stars if I could. Not only does Congar present his thesis with great expertise, he covers ALL the bases in regards to tradition, scripture, and the Church just as the subtitle says. He's done his homework, now do yours! Protestants beware!This will not be a quick read, however. You'll need to take some time to chew on this one. Other books which you may want to look at include: ""Not by Scripture Alone"" by Sungenis, ""By What Authority?"" by Shea, ""Eucharist"" by Bouyer, ""the Christian Tradition"" in 5 volumes by Jaraslov Pelikan, ""Common Ground"" by Bajis, ""The Vindication of Tradition"" by Pelikan, and ""The Orthodox Way"" by Bishop Kallistos Ware."
1,Very Cheap Glass,Very Cheap GlassThe pictures of the items I got look nothing like what I got. I purchased these:X1102 Handblown Art Glass Blue SculptureX181-2 Glass Purple Vase Elegant 100% Handblown ArtThe Blue glass was not cleaned before it was glued to the base and was full of dirt. Had it been clean it would have been nice. The Purple was nothing like the picture was very scratched up with lots of bubbles It seems to me these come out of China on high volume and no QC... centrally not a gift able itemThe seller did let me return the items however I am out shipping on heavy items.
1,This thing is HUGE!,"bought this two years ago and it is still in the packaging. Either my daughters hampster is really small or this thing was made for a weasel. Haha, I should have returned it... The product might be great but I'm giving it a 1 star because it is not what I expected to get. May have been my fault for not realizing how big a 7"" ball is, just saw hampster ball and ordered it."
3,Worth seeking out,"Well this album sounds hopelessly stuck in traction circa 1991. Kinda a Soul Asylum rip-off which isn't as bad as it sounds really. Would be completely forgotten (well, okay, it probbaly is at that) except that this was producer/singer-songwriter extraordinaire Jay Bennet's band before he helped make Wilco such a great band (and was canned for his trouble ... and of course because he was acting like a jerk) and his talent does come through on some of the great songwriting and tight arrangments. Shame they weren't just a little more cued into where music was going."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"Somehow, it didn't live up to my expectations. His books don't always live up to the standards to which he is capable.,"
3,Not a favorite,I had previously read 2 of TM's books. I really enjoyed them but this one was hard to get through. I felt she took quite a while getting to the point! The relationship aspect was not very strong or interesting.
5,Excellent!,"What more could you want in a novel? Romance, adventure, revenge, intrigue, a mouthy dwarf, and really cool swordplay. Reading ""Lady of Conquest"" was like reading ""Beowulf"" except that it was totally enjoyable. Very nicely done."
2,I FOUND THE HISTORICAL REFERENCES TROUBLING.,"MS. MEDEIROS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS. HER BOOKS ARE ALWAYS SO FUNNY. I LOVE THAT. I LIKE A STORY WITH SWORD WIELDING WOMEN ALSO. BUT I FOUND REFERENCES TO FEATHER MATTRESSES , PILLOWS AND WOODEN FLOORS TROUBLING. SHE GIVES NO DATE REFERENCE AT THE BEGINING OF EACH CHAPTER. BUT SHE STATED IN HER AUTHOR'S NOTE THAT CONN EXISTED 1000 YEARS BEFORE MALORY IMMORTALIZED ARTHUR. IN HER EPILOGUE SHE STATED THAT THE FIANNA WERE ANNILATED ABOUT 280 AD. THAT IS LONG BEFORE THE CONQUERER. WERE THE IRISH MORE CIVILIZED THAN THE BRITISH AND ALREADY HAD THESE COMFORTS LONG BEFORE THE BRITISH? PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG. I KNOW THIS WAS HER FIRST NOVEL. BUT I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPRINTED WITH A DISCLAIMER. I DO PREFER HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS IN MY HISTORICAL NOVELS."
3,cart ahead of the horse,"I ordered the filter and bacteria treatment then took old unit to shop for cleaning. to my dismay the motor bearings were packed with lint, after comple disassembly and cleaning the motor would work but the control panel failed..One other review advised duct taping a regulat furnace filter on the back of unit in place of the inadequate furnished filter which I now see would have been an excellent idea..I use the bacteria treatment as additive to my large pot of water on top of woodstove so not all was lost..Mike"
4,product works,"the products works as expcted, however, I have notice it that it needs to be replaced every 6 months, some other filters last about 3 months which covers the entire season here in wisconsin. with this replacement, I have to replace every 6 weeks otherwise it start smelling funny"
4,"Fun, fun, fun","True to form this is another example of Clive Cussler's great situational writing. The ever present Dirk Pitt once again battles fiendish villians and insurmountable odds. In SAHARA Pitt needs to find the source of a compound that is causing the red tide to mutate and threaten the earths supply of oxygen. With his ever trusty sidekick Al Giordino he attempts to locate the route of the problem in the middle of Africa. During his pursuit he runs into the evil likes of a French billionare who's name I do not care to spell and an African dictator who would just as soon have you shot than look at you. Don't be fooled, a classic this is not, but an outlandishly fun read it certanly is"
4,"Entertaining, a clasical Cussler novel, but a bit too much..","Sahara is, indeed, a classical Cussler novel. Those who likehis style, as I do, will enjoy it a great deal. I could not put itdown!Cussler's ability to interwine past events (usually fiction) tothe plot of the novel was not as well done as in others suchas ""Inca Gold"". The unraveling of these mysteries addadditional enjoyment to this novel, but they could have beentaken out without detrimental effect to the plot (with someminor modifications).Good enough for an 8, perhaps an 8+, but not a 9 or a 10"
4,Solidly enjoyable,"This is the first Clive Cussler book I have ever read. Reading some of the reviews, I see some people didn't like this book, but I actually enjoyed this book a lot. I had been going through the bargain bin of books at the local store and found this book as a marked-down paperback. I read the back of the book and it sounded interesting, so I picked it up. And I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.Yes, a certain suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy this book, especially the part with Abraham Lincoln. But overall the story is well-paced, the characters fun, and the action interesting. There's just so much great stuff going on, I really did love this book. It might not be for everyone, but if you're looking for an action and adventure book with colorful characters, fun scenes, and some pretty cool historical trivia, you should enjoy this book. I give it a solid 4.5/5 stars."
1,Total Waste Of Paper,"This book was near the beginning of the end for Cussler as far as I'm concerned. It's quite simply too stupid for words. Here his dialogue reaches new lows and the storyline is even too ridiculous for him. Ouch....bad book, bad."
2,Precocious Pulp-- Pan? Praise? Preposterous. Pure Pleasure!!,"Following trusted recommendation, I devoured my first Cussler. The successful intersection of daring adventure and... well, not much else, made this an enjoyably quick, yet scintillating read. The two star rating reflects an ""all-in universal score"", much like that used in springboard and platform diving-- difficulty multiplied by kubuki-theater-execution. This is a must-read for no one, but an essential part of the cocktail party repertoire for any BoBo. In summary, I loved it."
4,Another Great Read,"What a premise and terrific subplots ! OK, OK...so it is a bit far-fetched, but that is what good fiction does, it stretched the imagination to possible what-ifs and if onlys'. Lots of the usual twists and turns, but again, Cussler has given us an involved tale with characters we can visualize and a locale that always evokes possibilities. Cussler is a terrific storyteller and I like to think I have helped pay for his car collection...well, maybe a few gallons of car wax !If you are looking for a book that makes a great beach read or one of those books to cuddle up with on a cold night, this is the book - out of his many works. Enjoy !"
3,Not for the seriously interested,"These are ghost ""stories"". There is little or no background or investigative info. If you are looking for an indepth account of true hauntings...this isn't it. The stories are short and boring. I gave three stars out of respect for Holzer not the book."
5,Don't understand why the ratings are low on this item.,"I bought this as a replacement for the cordura nylon (plastic lining) sheath that came with my Buck 119 when I bought it. I lost the original while hunting this fall. The replacement is made of solid leather, witha leather spacer on the edge, plastic lining to prevent shredding of the inside of the sheath, and a snap on handle which goes around the handle of the knife to prevent inadvertent withdrawal of the knife from the sheath. It is equivalent in fit to the original and I have no complaints. The construction appears good and the hardware appears to be of good quality. It is everything I expected and more."
5,Nice sheath,"This sheath seems to be very good quality for the money. I purchased it to replace a lost sheath, and it works great."
2,Sloppy Sheath for a Great Knife,"The Buck 119 is an excellent knife, but I don't know why they include such a sloppy. poorly designed case. On the upside, the sheath is heavy leather lined with plastic to keep the clip point from shredding the leather. On the other hand, the knife rattles around in the sheath, and the guard hangs up on the retaining flap when you try to draw the knife."
1,Beware! not the same,"I have always loved this sause and have used it for years feeling guilty the whole time.My grandma would kill me if she knew I was using Jared sause, but no more.They have stopped using San marzano tomatoes and is no way near as good.Back to making my own sause.."
4,Good light read. Enjoyable.,"Having read all of Tamar Myers books, I decided to give Mary Daheim a try. My husband & I stay in Bed & Breakfasts when we travel, so a mystery in one intrigued me. I wasn't disappointed. It was very good and I didn't guess the killer. I was amazed that the whole story took place in just a couple of days, but as they say, time flies when you're having fun! - solving a mystery that is."
5,Amazing,I've watched it about 20 times with my girls!! They love it:) i'll be watching this one for the next couple of years that's for sure
4,pink tool belt,"Girlgear Industries 69 Pink Tool BeltThis was a gift for my daughter as she loves to use tools and ever since she saw Paige using pink tools on Extreme Home Makeover, she has been wanting one. She is very pleased with it and loves it and will get lots of use out of it in her home improvement tasks. The price was fair and it is of good material. I would buy it again!"
3,Causes Interference,As far as the functionality of the phone goes I have never had a problem. Unfortunately the phone causes severe interference with my wireless network. If I do not keep at least three feet between the computer and the handset while using the phone my network connection completely shuts down.
2,Not for me,"Mine had problems early and stopped working altogether within a month. It also got quite hot, even tho it was in a wide open location. Whaddya want for $25? A little more, says I."
2,Speed dial unusable,"To use the speed dial, you must first hold down the button to get the number to be displayed. Then press phone or spkrphone to send. I'd say about 80% of the time when I used the phone button I got ""number could not be completed as dialed"". If I used the spkrphone button instead it always worked, convincing me that it was the phone button and not something else. I also had complaints that people couldn't hear me, but only when I was using the headset (which is most of the time). I use this same headset with other phones, so I'm fairly sure it wasn't the headset.I returned it for a replacement phone and it had the same problem. I have to say that amazon has made the whole return process very easy. Since the second phone exhibits the same problem, I'll get refunded. I commend their customer service."
1,Too bulky; low battery life; poor quality,"I bought this phone to replace a GE phone. It's a lot bulkier and heavier with a much lower battery life. The sound quality is ok if I'm in the same room with the base, but has a constant ""record skipping"" sound when I leave the room with it. I bought this phone because it was just a few dollars more than a new battery for my old phone. I wish I'd just bought the new battery instead."
3,Redundant,"Although it is full of a lot of interesting ideas, this book is basically a compilation of assorted musings garnered primarily from Elliott's previously published articles. In an age of boundless and readily available information, books that strive for synthesis and brevity are often the most useful in education. As a text for foundations courses in music education as well as inservice reading for music teachers, Music Matters misses the mark. However, as a source for a myriad of ideas and directions in music education philosophy, I have found it especially useful."
2,keyboard non-functional,"It is a decent keyboard, but a couple of the keys are irregular in their response. For me the problem with those keys makes the whole thing non functional. Having to keep going back to retype stuff does not work for me, so I am not using it and wish I could return it for a refund."
2,Potentially dangerous,This car seat frame was a bit scary for me too! My daughter's car seat has also slipped through the frame a few times and now I've decided to just stop using it and get another one. I don't think this should be used with the Baby Trend car seats so it's not really universal. I also had trouble with the front wheels. It does fold down very nicely though and is very lightweight and easy to carry.
5,Awesome product!!,"These blinds work great and I am so happy with them. If you are on the edge of whether or not to buy them, don't hesitate....they are exactly as described and what I was looking for. Thanks!"
5,"really like both movies, picture quality good","I thought this was a great bargain, and I like bothmovies very much.The picture quality was good for both movies: I don'tfeel the need to upgrade to bluray."
2,Choose another DVD,"This DVD is not that cool. If you want a Christmassy ambience, there is a lot of DVD better than this one. And cheaper !"
4,nice product,"Fits well, provides good protection, it extends all the way up to the back of the 2nd row."
2,Good - but kind of cheating,"I'm a huge fan of Lynne Robinson's Pilates DVDs they are well explained and cater to all difficulty levels. But if you have bought any of her previous ones, don't bother with this. It's a mish-mash of the last few. By all means buy this if you haven't used her DVDs before as she is a great instructor but I have to say I felt more than a little cheated by Total Pilates."
2,Elevator Music,"While this CD is a nice idea, it isn't really that enjoyable! The reproductions of the featured classical pieces sound more like elevator music and have become annoying to me. I have searched for music that I can play for baby while I am pregnant and continue to play after she is born. I guess my advice is not to buy something that YOU can't enjoy also, because you'll be hearing it a lot!"
3,Cute stickers,Not much to say. Stickers are cute and they do what they are supposed to - stick to things!
3,Ummmm...Doug? Are you OK?,"UGH. I don't know. Maybe it was reading it aloud while driving through Southern New Mexico with my best friend at the time, the day after she left her husband. Maybe it was the stories I chose to read aloud. I'm perfectly willing to blame my own choices, partly because I do not want to believe Dearest Doug could produce such a boring piece of CBSNews Dan-I'd-Rather-Not fluff. The stories were tired, overwrought and lonesome. I truly did not want the thought to pop in my head that Doug scribbled these stories out the night before his deadline, as though it were a tiresome English paper. Nonetheless, the thought occured.Please, read this book only if you are ABSOLUTELY FASCINATED with the grateful dead or oj simpson. NO ONE ELSE should touch it. i love dougie-pie with all my heart for his earliest work, but this was just, well, yucky.Reading nutritional information held more entertainment value. And I only say that because I love him so much."
3,Good System,this book good for new commers. and I appreciate U and I say again this is very good book
2,no la compren,"le cortaron las partes mas romanticas y ecenas importantes dejaron lo que siempre se ve en todas las novelas, no la recomiendo, no tiren su dinero, mejor ubiese sido grabar 3 discos y grabarla completa aunque cobraran un poco mas por el producto, recuerden ustedes viven del cliente por lo tanto el cliente merece lo mejor y si paga por esto quiere recibir lo mejor. no hagan eso porque es de mal gusto. NO LA RECOMIENDO A NADIE . NO LA COMPREN"
4,Excellent short story compilation,"I liked the fact that each story is only 10-15 pages allowing a quick dip in the 40k universe whenever you have 30 minutes to spare. The stories are grouped in logical categories so that while you are reading from different authors the topic stays focused for 4-5 stories. You get all the Space Marine stories together and all the Inquisition stories together and so on.There are really ingenious plot twists in a couple of the stories that take the expected ""we're all gonna die"" 40k mantra in fresh directions.If you enjoy the 40k ""fluff"" in all the rulebooks and codices then you'll really enjoy this."
4,If you like Xena and Hercules...,... or the Hardy Boys. I feel guilty about enjoying this book so much. I picked it up while waiting for my daughter and had to buy it. Then finished it in one day. I bought the second volume the day it appeared in the bookstore and finished it in one day also. I was hoping the thrid volume might be available already here. Oh well. It's a nice escape for a rainy day.
3,Good entertainment but...,"The Ramses novels by Christian Jacq are good entertainment for people who like adventure and suspense in a historical setting, but that does not mean that these books are reliable from a historical point of view. The writer rearranged facts and added his own creative fantasy to it to serve his goal: the creation of a fairy-tale about a noble, invincible king with supernatural powers and a fairy queen for wife. The story too highly depends on a very active 'deus ex machina'. The dead of certain people suits the writer more than the story. Not to mention a lion and an elephant who think and act like human beings! But, as I said, I enjoyed myself..."
2,Disappointed!,Unfortunately I read The Memoirs of Cleopatra this Summer and found myself comparing the two books. I spent three weeks with Cleopatra and felt like I'd been transported back in time. I spent three days with Ramses and had to remind myself this is a period piece. The writing was simplistic but I couldn't tell if that was the translators fault. I had plans to buy the other volumes as they were released but now I doubt it.
2,Children's fiction?,"I wish someone had told me this was a children's book before I bought it. Then I might not have found the overly simplistic writing style quite so annoying. It was really difficult to form any attachment or even interest in the characters as they were all so superficially drawn and breaking off each incident and anecdote after a couple of paragraphs made it very hard to gain any sense of continuity. I read the book to the end as I was truly interested in Ramses' fate, but I doubt I'll buy any more in this series. Which is a shame as I find history and especially ancient Egypt fascinating. Nice try, shame about the outcome."
4,A good historical journey,"The history of the ancient Egyptians is one of my favourite subject, in particular Ramses due to his significance not only to egypt history but also to other related events surrounding him at the time e.g. Moses. As far as the book by Jacq is concern, it did serve its purpose of delivering the message accross. This should be the fundamental element in any books. With regards to how its written, is just a matter of delivery. What interest me most about the book is that it describe a beautiful life journey of a young Prince in ancient Egypt. And how metaphorical it can be to our current era. It is not exactly the best written book I've ever read, but just like I've said earlier, it delivers the history."
1,"A silly, unimaginative and unconvincingly dull story.","Written for the 12 to 15 age group, this book is a publishing monstrosity. Jaq makes almost no attempt to provide an Egyptian context for his story of Ramses. Can anyone imagine an Egypt without slavery? Jaq not only eliminated the institution but adds that all workers were well paid! The author's fanciful creation might work if the artifical world he created had believeability--but it does not. The author claims to be an Egyptologist, but if he is, then he has cynically removed virtually all cultural substance for the sake of creating a Hardy Boys view of ancient life."
2,Surprisingly...Disappointed,"Frustrated by the erroneous historical facts - I would have appreciated a disclaimer in the preface - especially in light of the authors expertise in the field of Egyptology. And in light of the author's expertise, was disappointed by the amazing lack of detail in describing the scenes,time period, and customs of the people this book was supposed to be about. I generally approach reading historical fiction or a story set in another country with the expectation of getting some of the flavor of the culture and/or time period where the book takes place and this book did none of that. Furthermore, the characters seemed very 20th century in their sensibilities and shallow in their development - we were allowed to get into Ramses's head only to find there wasn't much going on. Was given the very negaitve impression that there wasn't much thought about the book going on in the author's head either."
5,Honest helpful and loving advice,"This little book is quick to read and will help give you courage to do what is right. Sometimes Christian women get so bogged down in guilt and the need to save our marriage, that we forget to save ourselves. This book is a must read for anyone in an abusive marriage seeking spiritual guidance. Solid, Christlike interpretation of scripture will offer much needed inspiration and encouragement."
3,Not worth $300,This ab machine works good but is very wobbly and not very sturdy. I would definitely buy this machine but only for about $150 it is really worth half of its value. I am not complaining about the workout becuz like I said it does it's job but when it comes to physical value with sturdiness etc. after putting it together and trying it out it will tip on someone who is bigger. Maybe more ideal for a women. I can't stress enough.. Buy this machine for a good ab workout but don't pay $300 it's just not worth that kind of money.
1,Product never received.,"Ordered the Ab Crunch Machine the week of Christmas and nearly a month later, I still have not received it. Obviously wouldn't recommend anyone buying a product that can't be delivered with the promise of receiving it in time to be a Christmas present."
2,Not 100 Coverage for CCSA NG exam,This book is totally false advertisement. I sent email to the pulisher for an explanation and never got a reply. The CD-ROM doesn't cover lab simulations and only 64 instead of 250 questions as advertised on the from and back cover. It doesn't cover much detail for every topic in the book which should be rate as INTRODUCTION to CCSA NG in user level.
4,pc caddy does the job,"i wanted a caddy to make my pc wiring more accessible, and i wanted it as sleek as possible, so as not to destroy the aesthetic of my workspace. the allsop did the trick. it's easy to assemble & lightweight too! my one complaint (a tiny one at that) is that the caddy in the photo appears to be brushed chrome, while mine is closer to filing cabinet grey-brown. all in all though, a great item."
2,needs improvement,"The product looks great and functions well. However, putting it together and adjusting it to fit my computer was at best awkward. One of the screws/stems was(were) defective and I had to use pliers to tighten it. Given those issues, disassembling it and adjusting it to another one of my computers at homes would be a challenge. Product could be much improved."
3,A challenge to assemble,"The assembly of this CPU Cart is challenging. There are few parts and it is pretty straight forward but the positioning of the wing nuts on the wheels make it difficult to tighten them fully. Also, trying to tighten the wingnuts to secure the sides in positon after you've put the CPU in the stand is challenging because there is very little clearance between the bottom of the cart and the tabletop/floor/surface you're using."
1,Disapointed,"This is the last time I get a video that's not from a person I know is from a decent lineage. I've seen worse videos than this, but still...a bit dodgy. Rather just watch the Ma family on Youtube if you want to see good Wu Style Push Hands..."
2,Disappointing.,"After reading Bailey's ""Kitty and Virgil"" and ""Gabriel's Lament"", I found this novel a total disappointment. I suppose it was intended to be charming and sad. To me, it was a slight book (in impact as well as length) which relies on interesting plot devices to make the story readable."
3,Half an album,"I currently have the first three albums in the series. Of those three, this album will get the least-frequent play in my iPod. While there are recognized classics like 'Giant Steps' and 'Green Dolphin Street', there are also less-than-classics like '500 Miles High' and some pure dreck like 'Feelings'.Although Joe does as well as any guitarist might, one feels a bit of pressure to be 'current' with tunes like 'If'. Perhaps my own hearing is tainted by familiarity with the originals, but I can't help but feel Joe was polishing a you-know-what. These performances show too much effort in redeeming tunes that just aren't worth it.As far as the real jazz on this CD goes, it's great. Perhaps the solution is to uncheck the pieces I've complained about and just to play the good stuff. Works for me."
4,Does the job,These locks were half the price of cheap locks at retail stores and they do the job for budget bikes. If you have a $1000 mountain bike you may want to invest in something more sophisticated but this lock will stop the casual thief.
3,good but not great,this book kept my interest at first but as I made my way farther into the book I found I was skipping pages to finish.
4,No more ailias' on this job!,"Once again Shawn Smith has come up with an album to put any leading artist to shame! Pure, simplistic and some of the most heartfelt lyrics to come from an amazingly prolific man. The influence by Prince is not as prominate as 'EDC' or 'Pigeonhed' but still it has the rawness of something strong thats just about to happen. If this is his 'debut', I can't wait to hear his 'Sign 'O' the times'."
2,Too many tiny pieces,This toy has a lot of pieces! Within one hour at lease ten pieces were missing. My son lost interest because his attention span is too short to find all the pieces.
4,"Good enough ""plus""",The paper is about half the price and seems of a higher weight than what I have been buying from local repro center.
1,Do NOT waste 88 minutes of your life watching this movie!,"This was by far the worst acting, most predictable plot, most cliched movie I have ever wasted my time watching. I highly advise you to NOT waste your time watching it. The only thing I have found it useful for is pranking my friends. I tell them it's great and they'll love it and watch them in awe of it's terrible...everything and laugh while they attempt to gouge their eyeballs out. I only found it funny because it was so bad."
2,"Horrible acting, improbably storyline","Not good. Bad Acting. Bad storyline. Bad camera work. Bad lighting. The dog is the best one really. My 6-year-old liked it, but I had a very hard time watching it."
2,Not So Cool,"Let me just first say that I can suspend my disbelief but not this much.The dog scenes are so fake and whenever they show his paws you can tell it's just a prop.The worst is him driving a car.Like his legs can really reach the gas pedal and the dog playing checkers?Don't even get me started on that.I guess this dog can do more thing's than some people,including me since I don't drive.I love dogs and I've seen plenty of dog movies but this one was the most unrealistic wich in turn didn't make the movie that good.It's to bad because I liked the story of the dog traveling to New York to get back to his owner but I'm still glad I watched it because the dog was cute but would never want to watch it again.I think kids will enjoy this much better than adults so I would only recommend this for children 10 or younger.2 and a half stars for Cool Dog."
1,Worst acting ever!!!,Don't watch it. Big waste of time and possibly money.The plot is horrible and predictable and the acting is worse.Not sure what to add besides not to watch!!!
2,Limited practical application,"The Business Card Book presents basic information about business card use, generic design hints, and the history behind business cards. The book is not a practical ""how to"" guide -- despite the title. Most of the information is intended to minimally inform a business owner about the business card design process and assumes that the actual design is done by a professional. However, if a business owner contracts with a good designer, this book is essentially irrelevant. The book would be better described as a ""how to check up on your business card designer"" or ""what to look for in a business card designer.""The lack of practical usable information unnecessarily limits the utility of this work for someone seeking information on developing or designing business cards."
5,A must read for all who carry a business card,I had never paid attention to what a business card may or may not help accomplish. Reading Dr. Grants Business Card Book allowed a new and beneficial insight. Thanks. Jehangir
2,ITS A TOY,this gun is more like a toy than anything it is very un acurate and the fps sucks its around 100 fps if even its even that but wat can u ecpect out of a 30 dollar airsoft gun it is good for the price the fps may suck but even at a 100 fps mi frans say it hurts so its ok?
3,Great SMG...but,"I bought this gun looking for a temorary primary. Im 14 years old and on a budget, so after reading reviews and looking for prices, i decided to purchuse this P-90. I got the gun, with no damage to the gear and was quite excitted. Its preety good, but l don't recamend i wouldnt recomend it to rough players or experienced players because onthe first day of use at Combat City in Orlando, Florida it broke :(Pros:Compact design means easy handlingAccurate up to 75 yardsRed Dot ACOG sight quite accurate.Quite ""Handy""High Mag CopacictyCons:Small for large playersRails for attachments aren't best qualityBattery didn't hold charge well; only played with it for it for 45 minutesBreaks easilyOverall, aduquete gun. I would stick with using more expensive guns, as i amHope this helps!!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Not what i expected fires slow, its weak,and the magazine is terrible you have to shake it to get ammo in it. I already sold it on the 3rd week. It has terrible range it says 60 but it goes 20"
3,GOOD GUN BUT POOR CLIP.,"THE gun it self its alsome but the grav fed clip sucks. bbs get stock occasionally, and you will have to shake it wile you fire. also the clip really don't hold much compare to my ak and m16. but also of good stuff came with it through. like the target, i really don't like the bag at the end cause my ak just shoot through it like the paper. but over all its a very good gun."
2,not the best at all.,"I bought this gun because I'm a fan of the p90. this gun is not good! the design is cool. is awesome how the magazine goes on the top. it may look cool but it jams a lot. it may hold a lot of bb, but it does not insert them one at a time into the gun, so you are going to have to shake it to git it unjammed. And the magazine does not have a spring in it so you have to keep the gun level or the bb will not go into the gun. the scope is harible. The flash light is probably the best feature of the gun. NOT KIDDING! Over all its not worth it. This is why I gave it a 2 star rating. Don't buy this gun!"
4,Not Louis' Best Work... but worth the watch.,"It was a little unfortunate... because we all so much enjoyed Louis' animated humor surrounding his children. He filmed this at an emotional juncture in his life, and the kind of dark feeling really is pervasive throughout the special. It kind of reminds me of ""funny guys"" where Adam Sandler stands up and does a really depressing number at a comedy club (and everyone is looking around like, ""really?""). It is entertaining, but just... a little dark. I miss the light hearted Louis. I hope he gets happy again so we can see more of his talent."
5,As good as Stand-Up gets,"Louis is amazing, and is probably the best stand-up working today, with Eddie Izzard and Billy Connolly tied for second. At the moment. What he does that's so incredible is he throws out his entire set once a year, and starts over. So this film is a record of his 2009 material. Each year's stuff gets better and better, and gets stepped up a notch. I saw him live a few weeks ago, doing the 2010 act (called ""Word,"") and it was even better. His is a brilliant, beautiful mind, and it's a pleasure to follow it wherever it goes."
1,Don't waste your MONEY!,This DVD is very VULGAR. Not even funny! Don't waste your money or time. No comparison to my well liked and own Jeff Dunham.
5,louis ck hilarious,Louis C. K. Hilarious...he is the funniest and has such a weird sense of humor....loved it! he free associates and is very relatable.
1,Why would Marcus have to buy his own ring back?,"I shall be brief...why do historical romance authors come up with such stupid concepts for books? Ms. Hawkin's Talisman Ring Series have been hits and misses, the best the first, An Affair to Remember, and to me the worst (prior to this one) was ""And The Bride Wore Plaid"" because Devon was, in a word, a cad. Seducing woman (especially one's friends sister) with no plans to marry is in poor taste. In this story, the one that should have been the best and brought all brothers back for the story, is just wrong. The premise, that Marcus wants the family ring back that has fallen in to Honoria's hands, is made unbearable by the very simple fact that Honoria knows it rightfully belongs to Marcus so her efforts to force Marcus to purchase the ring are just morally wrong and there is no way to get around that in the story. That is the elephant in the room. One can not get past that."
5,Being Home,I have bought this book several times. I love it so much I've given many copies away to friends. This last copy is for myself. And I was very satisfied with this shopping experience. Thanks!
1,Loving v. Virginia,"Have not read the book at all, but I just discovered while listening to oral argument in the 1967 case of Loving v. Virginia, that the Va. Asst. Atty. General used this book to justify a state's right to make interracial marriages illegal. He used this as part of his argument defending Virginia's law under the ""rational basis"" test, no less; the easiest level to lose on Constitutional grounds (for a controversial subject, that is; have to show that making the classification makes sense toward attaining some legitimate policy objective).Like the German lawyer in the film ""Judgement at Nuremburg"" cited Holmes in Buck v. Bell (""three generations of imbeciles is enough"") to defend German judges' orders to sterilize people, this volume is likely useful at least as history of law and social science, showing us how completely wrong we have been, and the ability of courts to recognize that in real time.The Lovings won, after all."
2,"if your professor picked this textbook, i'm sorry","my professor chose this book for the class Intro to Psychology...and i can't wait to sell it.this book has the worst organization. instead of having chapters, it has ""modules,"" which are THE SAME THING as chapters! i think the authors just like the psychology behind using a different word! the information is cluttered and cramped on the pages and overflow normal concepts of margins. it is overwhelming to the eye and isn't aesthetically pleasing. plus, from page to page, the presentation is not uniform, which just adds to the unorganized look. and the pictures are absurd - copyright costs must have been outrageous, forcing the authors/art designer to have to go with free images which look ridiculous.further, i find the information redundant and the definitions vague.good luck!"
5,Great Ski Warmup!,I purchased this dvd having a yoga and pilates background. I had a horrible first experience skiing and thought that this dvd might help me train the correct muscles needed for this difficult sport. It is a good and relaxing workout that stretches the muscles that are used during skiing. I felt much more confident in getting back into skis after using this dvd.
3,ok but not authoritive,"This book is good in that it gives some interesting historical detail about ships and the age they lived in. But the problem is that the authors chose to highlight famous ships and tell their particular story, so the book is left lacking in overall history of these types of ships. Also the artist who did the illustrations is not very good. Some of the ships have grossly incorrect perspective and proportions, and the overall quality looks ""painted"" as in landscape painting. So you would not want to use this book for a reference for modeling."
5,"""I censor my emotions and tell myself to bide my time...""","I agree with many of the previous reviews; this is a grossly overlooked album. JJ is a lyrical satirist with a bulls-eye view. I love it when he sings ""Sometimes love grows like a flower or it grows like a tumor. Love shows that god has a sense of humour."" Joe's poetry crackles with verve, spunk and dash."
3,wish it were better,"I enjoyed this book enough to finish it (its a very quick read), but I have to admit it was disappointing. I'd enjoyed Pope's Decision at Trafalgar, and had high hopes for this book as well. Good story, good writer, had to be a good book, I figured. But neither the people nor the ships ever come to life. This is a story with lots of moving parts, and Pope's failure to flesh out the characters makes it less engaging and harder to follow. (The exasperating absence of maps makes the latter problem worse.) If this book had been more of a labor of love, it could have been outstanding."
2,"Looks cute, but not as good as the ball","Because this toy can only go forward and backward, it's not as useful as the traditional ball. I have to readjust it and guide my hamster everytime he runs into something. It also has the option of using the wheel part separate from the car, but it tips over easily and then the hamster can't go anywhere. I overpaid for this in the pet store, and now I'm buying the standard ball anyways."
2,looks better than is i think,I got this as a gift for my 10year old nephew and his hamster. He was all excited couldn't wait to try it out. He (with helpfrom mom and dad) had hard time getting it to work right (bought the track too). Sonow just uses the hamster ball on the track. So that was pretty much a waste of money..
2,doesn't work,"By all means, this product seems to be amazing, and it would be, if it worked correctly. However, the car is too wide for the wheel to stay on...it becomes crooked at the first spin, or even when you just put it on the floor. This might not be for all the cars; I bought two(one for my hamster, and one for my sisters hamster) and my car seems a little bit better than hers do; her wheel doesn't even reach the ends of the inside of the car."
4,Great book for Tori fans who want to play the main notes,"This is a GREAT book for Tori fans who desire to play her beautiful songs in the basic forms; however, it simply cannot transcribe what Tori actually plays, so it is somewhat toned down. This is at no fault of the editors; Tori is simply too talented. :) It is a great way to play the songs however, and I highly recommend it for Tori fans. ALSO - I think Upside Down is worth it alone, as well as Mother, Winter, and Leather. My only complaint is that they cut Mother short... I wanted to play the gorgeous part when she just sings slowly ""Oooh ooh, mother...leave the light on..."" and so on, but that really isn't on there. BUT!!! I love the book and I think its well worth it. (to address the very first post, some of my pages have started to come out, but I've sort of abused it over the 2 years I've had it). Great book."
3,Spring broken,"I order four hinges , but spring in one hinges get broken after few swing the door . Door is hollow ( 78"" -18"")i wery low weight."
2,Hinges okay but still a problem,"Two problems. First I ordered two hinges. One was faulty so I ordered two more.Second , I need to find a plate to put on door frame to make it so we can latch/lock. This was for a small bathroom and with elderly people if they fell we couldn't get normal door open. I got the idea from visiting a hospital that bathroom doors swung both ways. Can some one help me find this plate."
2,not a good fit,"Chrome is nice and it is packaged well, but it doesn't fit very well. There is a lip all the way around the outer edge that keeps it from sitting on door handle properly (I am installing on a 1999 F150XL). They actually sent me two sets for the one set price, which is helpful because I mounted the first set to see how it would look being mis-aligned due to lip on back and I'm not real happy with that, so I will probably use the bench grinder to try and put an angle on the lip of the second set so I can rip the first set off and try the modified set."
2,"never again, i keep this as a lesson","i knew this sword set would not be very good. i already have a good katana so i know how much it costs for quality. i was simply hoping for an ok katana i could practice with so as not to damage my good one. even for what i paid its not that good, parts were falling off, nothing major just some parts of the saya, but still. i was thinking they were like wall hangers, but they dont even look good. i keep them as a lesson. the handle is bad, its thicker then it should be and they were to cheap to have the imitation ray skin go all the way around, so if you look in the corners you can see the woden inner handle. balance is off so it is not even very good for practice. for your own sake its probably not a smart idea to get this as anything but a wall hanger that no one will inspect. dont get this for practicle use for any reason, but a 50 katana kit. o and it was not very sharp....... at all. the free knife is the only good thing in this deal"
4,Translated ideas can impress too!,"I picked this book primarily because after reading both verse and prose from the author, I know the translation would make a great reading. It did. I liked the poetry, the ideas, and whatever Chinese poets must have thought about was communicated as well as possible in well-compiled text. I cannot read or understand Chinese, but my Chinese friends found the translations to be inadequate and half-hearted representations of what they described as timeless, classic poetry. Knowing the difficulty in faithfully representing a different culture for an author, and the complexity of translation of any verse, cultures, times and metaphors, I think Vikram Seth as always did a commendable job. For real taste of his poetic genius, read The Golden gate or All you who sleep tonight!"
2,Star rating: it depends,"While not up to Fulci's Zombie, this is a stylish, if tedious, zombie flick, with some good scenes, but not really Dawn of the Dead quality. Very gory, but the suspense has some catching up to do with Fulci's House by the Cemetery's relenting terror. 2 stars, for Fulci is a master at gore."
3,Not a four cassette series! A great gore feast...,"A nightmarish gore feast that will scare the hell out of you. Zombies, zombies and even more zombies... some equiped with telekenetic powers to force a victims brains out their ears and their guts out their mouths. Check it out... you'll never see anything like it again. END"
1,Poor reliability,"I bought this drive about 4 months ago. I had it plugged in to my laptop and it suddenly stopped working. All of my data was lost. After doing a bit of research, it was also happening to other people. It supposedly crashed due to a power surge. I was very dissapointed with this drive and would not take a chance with it again."
1,Throw this thing away! 0 stars ! DONT BUY IT~!,Never buy this thing!It is stupid! I give it zero stars
2,Not as good as the first,"Child's Play 2 is very different from the first film. It introduces us to comedic Chucky, why is it that every good horror villian has to be a comedian ? The film does have good effects and one-liners though. Check it out if you want a good laugh."
1,VERY Poor Quality with Streaming :(,"I JUST purchased this movie through Amazon to watch it online, and couldn't get through the first 30 minutes without squinting! The video quality is very poor which irritates me since I could have watched it for free on hulu.com with a clear picture. Sure, I would have waited here or there for loading, but at least I'd be able to see what the hell I wanted to!Smh..."
4,Child's Play 2 hilarious violent fun,"This movie is better than the first in a sense. The first film does have a better story and plot. However, Child's Play 2 conjures up more violence and Chucky seems to have a more abusive language. The violence is pretty good in this picture and I think some of it has been done well. I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for a fun, horror picture."
5,The #1 Oh Wait #2 Horror Film,"This is the best chucky movie, and the best horror film of all time! This is a lot better then the original. It was a good Introduction which was rebuilting the doll. Only Andy and Chucky are back! Now how about that?! And I've never seen the movie till I bought it. It is starring ALEX VINCET. He's almost the main charactor, but you know who the real one is! There were funny parts, EXCPECIALLY the part where Kyle throws the boxes of the the dolls in the factory a chucky, and it the funniest voice he screams: ""WHAT THE HELL!??""And it's REALLY scary too. Watch at night. I don't want to give away the ending. That was funny, lots of gore and languege, don't buy unless your over 15! BUY IT!"
4,Almost as good as the first!,"When this film was due to be released in the early 90's I thought to myself cynically ""Hmm better leave this alone"" but I was hugely surprised by Child's Play 2. Alex Vincent reprises his role as the traumitized Andy. Now with foster parents Alex is hoping to forget about Chucky for good. Plenty of tongue in cheek humour and jumps like the first one but the plot is starting to weaken somewhat. Chucky was burnt to death and shot to pieces at the end of it's predecessor, so why did the factory remake the doll? A silly thing to do don't you think? Well, apart of this fans of the Child's Play series will not be disapointed and will forget about the loose plotline at the beginning. Overall a good comeback sequel, just as scary as the first."
3,backcountry inspiration,"Book was easy to read and inspires reader to get off the main road and really see and enjoy Yellowstone.My main complaint was that much read like it was out of a guidebook (maybe because I was just there and seemed ""same old stuff""). But I am glad I read it and wish I'd done more off the loop."
3,lost in my own backyard,"Booooooring! I got nothing out of this book, and sold it at a rummage sale for a quarter."
1,Terrible,"I am begging you now to put this book down, and run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. If you are outside of bushfire danger zones you might even like to burn it. I know I would have liked to.Tim Winton is perhaps the most over rated author in the history of mankind, and if it was at all possible I would sue him for publishing this drivel because I believe I died a little inside whilst reading it.Honestly, I found it convoluted, boring and in several parts, quite disturbing. If you can read it and enjoy it, then more power to you. But if you are not being forced by the Western Australian education system, I would recommend you stay far far away.Oh and Mr Winton? A hair cut never hurt anyone."
5,Old School Shaving,"Always wondered why my dad used a Double Edged razor, now I know! I purchased this razor a year ago and have enjoyed it ever since. I like the length of the handle and the extra weight . I used disposable razors in the past and there is no comparison in how close the shave is. The quality is top notch and I see no reason why it won't last a lifetime."
1,Too Elementary,"The Bennettmarine DVD on Garmin GPSMAP 5xx Series is too elementary to be of any value, I tossed it in the waste basket. The manual that comes with the device is all that is needed to use the unit, even for a beginner."
5,Portraits.,The book brilliantly discusses and displays photographs by Nadar and Warhol. It focuses briefly on the artist's biography and more on their collection of the photography (which are all portraits). A great buy for that photography lover or to be used for that photography history paper.
2,Not worth what I paid and not a real book.,"If you buy it understand it is a tiny 3 inch book with about one or two sentences per page (many pages have no text at all). So little serious content as to be considered a checkout counter toy. Many of the ideas are like take vitamins. Or you've heard it before- make associations, repeat it, etc. Let's face it, it's a bathroom ""book"" that I would be angry to find in my stocking at Christmas.Buy a real book instead. There are plenty of fine books on remembering people."
4,"Marvelous, but it's always nice to listen before you buy","Beautiful, fantastic, powerful; rock opera at its best. However, there's no need to take my word for it. If you have Windows Media Player, you can listen to samples of La Donna e Mobile, the Flower Duet from Lakme, and Nessun Dorma here: http://www.fanscape.com/Music/Adult/East-Village-Opera-Company/3201396.aspxThere is also a video clip of the artists talking about their music. Well worth the click!"
4,Only for the serious scholar of Roman culture,"This is not a book for those mildly interested or even highly interested but untrained in scholarly discourse about Roman culture. The focus is on sexuality and some of the best known and respected scholars have contributed: Marilyn B. Skinner, Amy Richlin, Sandra R. Joshel, and Judith P. Hallett stand out because their pivotal work on Roman sexuality already. However, it is the essay by Holt N. Parker, ""The Teratogenic Grid"" that provides the field with an understandable model of sexuality in Roman culture. Most of the pieces focus on men, something relatively new in the ancient field, but there are also a few that deal specifically with women. As in any academic work, there will be theories you love, some you see as valuable, and others you disagree with. But this not for someone unfamiliar with the research and changes in the study of Roman sexuality to dive into."
2,Science Book,"Hated this book. Too much info and not enough sub-title break downs. YOu couldn't skim the materials or read the ""highlighted"" information because it was all text that was just flowed in after the chapter pages. Horribly layed out!"
4,quality product,"fast delivery,, wife loves it. the look and feel. the lighter chain is not the best of features. as others have noted, my wife removed it as the fit for the lighter is snug and you have to lift the whole case up close to light a cigarette. A good product"
5,Ship Yourself To The Islands,"Think of Leo Kotke, Ry Cooder and John Fahey all rolled up into one guy. Ship him off to Hawaii for a gentle bake in the sun and surf... feed him tropical fruit drinks, invite him to luaus, let him enjoy the beauty of God's islands. You do this, and ""Coconut Hat"" is what you'll get back.I loved this recording... was immediately transported from the mainland back to the islands with their relaxed sense of time and nature, friendly people and a comfortable, casual lifestyle that suits me just fine."
3,Not solid,"but shiny. The stars are not solid, rather being sort of clam-like. Each star folds together and inserts into the next, leaving a visible gap which makes the bracelet look cheap. It is also very light. One side of the stars is puffy and the other side is flatter, and both sides were easily scratched during normal wear. So much for my 5-year anniversary gift."
3,Decent,"Good and bad. These are good because you cant pop the parts apart and create your own robots. The bad is that the limbs dont have joints at all and my boys pretty much got bored in 3 minutes. Also the girl robot's arms are so tiny that if you drop them on the carpet - good luck finding them! Great idea, but they should have been a bit bigger."
3,Heartwarming childhood christmas tale.........,Nice short story about a little boy and his experiences around Christmas. Is Santa Claus real? Will matthew survive the holidays? Will daddy come home from the war? A simple tale that warms the heart.
1,seems self-published,"can't remember why i had put this on my list, but my husband placed an order and this was waiting in the cart, so...this book is LONG, and seems like it didn't really have an editor. i like the idea, which is of some kids and two adults biking around the us."
4,HD is now wiiiiide,"The Canon HV20 HD Videocamera is really a great camera. But the normal ""wide"" angle of this camera is not very useful inside a house or close to something you want to tape. The original Canon WD-H43 0.7x Wide Angle converter seemed to be perfect. Cheaper converters always had bad reviews, so there must be a reason for this converter to be a little more expensive than the rest. After the part arrived I attached it to my camera and you see no blurry edges or so. Picture is still HD, crisp clear and when you zoom it stays very good.Only minus I have to add, just like many other reviewers, the weight is huge compared to the total weight of the camera itself. But I don't care. The pictures is the result I want to see, not a good looking, tiny video camera :-)"
1,Warps sides of the image,"This product warps the right and left sides of the image i.e. makes it curved. I wanted to be able to use my camera for wider angle shots, but in my opinion, this defect makes the video unusable. So I sent it back."
4,canon wide-angle adapter,I am very happy with this adapter. I think it's a bit more in line with the film feel I was after with my Canon Vixia HV30. It has the nice benefit of adding some weight to the camera as well. The captured footage has greater scope than the standard format available with the original lens. I've also found that at events I'm taken more seriously because the adapter makes the camera appear more professional.I am very satisfied.
5,Awesome Glass With Couple Small Hiccups,"Review of the Canon WD-H43 0.7x Wide Angle Converter.Overall I thought that the lens does what it is supposed to do and was well made. However, two things stand out that make we want to try a different adapter.Number one is that it does not have threads for filters to protect the glass.Number two is that NOBODY makes a lens hood for it. Yes, there is DIY modify of the xl1s hood to fit..... but come on people.... somebody could make a hood cheaply for this. The first time I used the lens straight out of the box I got lens flare.Some people say price is a problem but I had a coupon so I got a great deal on it.Thanks amazon and Vids4Kids !!"
1,Terrible quality not backed by company - BUYER BEWARE,"Swiss Diamond touts that you can treat this pan as any normal pan, using metal utensils and you won't have to worry about it flaking like low quality non stick pans.We used it delicately and used only non-stick utensils and it flaked within weeks of the first use. It took them 6 weeks to replace it under warranty. After receiving a 2nd pan we used it even more carefully to protect our investment in a ""quality pan"" and it flaked almost immediately.This times after waiting months for a reply the company would not back there warranty and the pan went in the trash.Don't waste your money or health this pan is nothing more than a cheap non-stick pan."
5,Best Omelette pan ever,"The shallow side of the breakfast pan is a great help when transfering an omelette to the serving dish. I also use it, with great success to make crepes. Like all Swiss Diamond pans it is magnificent."
5,Great Shaving Cream,"I have used this shaving cream since the 1998 with a great Taylor's shaving brush (bought at their shop in London. I have tried others (Body Shop, Crabtree & Evelyn) but prefer Taylor's."
3,Informative but Not Dynamic.,"I liked this book. It yielded a great deal of insight as to the functioning of unions. The subchapter on the teacher unions was my personal favorite, but its tone is partisan and it undoubtedly won't appeal to liberals or their fellow travellers. The prose is merely average but it does give helpful background on the ways in which the unions have influenced our political process-and not for the better."
1,Enron was non-union,All the union corruption in US history doesn't amount to one tenth of one Enron. Linda Chavez would like to see little kids working in coal mines again.
1,Dead Movie,"This movie boasts Denise Richards on it and also Volleyball, right? WRONG!!! Both of them are not in the movie all that much, especially Denise Richards. She also looks about 21 years old also. It turns out this movie was filmed actually in 1996, must have been shelved for a LONG while. All I can say is don't be suckered by the cover of the DVD unless you want to get be bored for 90 minutes.."
5,"Great taste, variety","This product performs as noted in the description- you will be relaxed! Yogi teas are one of my favorite brands as they do a great job blending practical function with subtle, delicious flavors. My wife has a difficult time sleeping and found this tea helpful in unwinding before settling in for the night."
5,Fabulous Dance Video,"Both the Amina dance routines and advice and Bert Balladine's live class footage are absolutely priceless. The legendary dancers of San Francisco are shown here in live performances, interviews and during downtown street shows.This exquisite dance footage is nothing less than a rare window into Belly Dance history. Every dancer should own a copy."
2,Wallace-an unbalanced view,An entertaining read but more opinion than fact based. Plenty of references but even more conjecture and supposition. Was Wallace so virtuous and Edward so evil? I don't think so. A book written to support the author's point of view with very little objectivity. The writing style is at times difficult to follow with events being related out of sequence or seemingly unrelated to the points being made...this is hardly a scholarly work. There must be better books on this subject....
1,When Love NEVER Comes!,I am so glad i picked up a used copy of this dvd. Generally New Zealand movies are great entertaimnent but this one is not. I was so disapointed. Throughout the movie you wonder who is with whom and what the heck is going on. Was there even a script for this bomb. Skip this one.
1,Stab in the heart - Infant Son from Mistress???,"From others review, I thought the story would be great. Dont mind guy who tried to reform or wooed back his wife. As every human are not perfect.I somehow felt SICK when Emma Rawlins show up with his infant son. It is not that I mind John decided to raise his bastard son in the house afterwards. But from my understanding that son was more important during that time, why the writer not have just girl from Mistress and boy from the real wife to compensate the reader's feeling?I could not keep this book (I normally collect all books I like and less like) but this one I donate it to local library the next day after I purchased it (I read through the nite). I will never touch this book ever. I read books for pleasure, not to be left feeling angry for all week!"
1,BAD CONDITION WHEN ARRIVE!,"I was so surprised there are so many good comments on this genuine cow hide leather credit card holder.Honestly, i don't expect much from something so cheap, but i didn't expect it to arrive scratched and looks used. The leather outside don't even look like it's new, look like it has been thrown in to the dump and revived just so it can be sold on amazon to dumbos like us.Mind you i ordered FIVE, and ALL FIVE arrived in this horrible condition."
1,Terrible - Betta's cut their fins and its Impossible to clean underneath plastic floor,"someone in my office brought this in with a Betta, Betta was miserable, soon the whole tank was covered in green slime because underneath the plastic floor cannot be cleaned and the green slime went crazy. ALso there was such little room for the fish to move and the hard plastic edges of the furniture hurt the fish."
3,"Very cute -- but for use ONLY with a single betta, at most","If you purchase this tank, do NOT use it for one goldfish, let alone two (as pictured on the box). That's cruel -- goldfish require far more space to be happy; not to mention, they produce a lot of ammonia and such a small space could kill them.I do, however, use this ""office fish tank"" for a single betta (aka Siamese fighting fish). Bettas don't require as much room or aeration as goldfish, and -- as their name indicates -- they typically don't get along with other fish and so are generally kept all by their lonesome.So for bettas, this tank is almost perfect (""almost"" because I'd still prefer it be bigger) -- visitors always get a chuckle out of it, and my betta has been happy and healthy in this environment for two years.Just make sure you clean it at least once a week to keep the water fresh and warm -- preferably the upper 70s / lower 80s."
4,cute/good little fish tank,"I have had this since xmas 2005 and have been using it since.Only downfall is you can only fit 2 Miniture fish, so not recommended for people that want special fish/ I have used guppies and now neons. Pretty easy to clean and light weight. KEEP door shut if you have cats,my cat just killed my one neon seeing is there is no lid!"
4,Different than I Expected,"I have tried the general yoga program on this video. It has a lot of props and does not flow nearly as much as I am used to doing in yoga. The poses are good, that is why I gave it 4 stars, but the video was different than I expected. I like the flow and the soothing music of Shiva Rea's video much better. If you want more of a workout type feeling, this video will do the trick."
5,Great book,"This book was very good - full of suspense and interesting plot lines. If you like romance or mystery novels, this book is for you. You are introduced to a number of characters which can get confusing at times, but everything comes together towards the end of the novel. I highly recommend adding this book to your collection!"
1,Ugh!,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was purchased because I never seen the finished product after I was on the set for a few nights as they were filming in Winter Park, FL. Hanging out with the cast was great. The movie, not so great."
2,Mine Broke!,"I had my flash drive about a year and a half, when one day, after removing it from my computer, it fell apart in my hands!!!! And flash drives are expensive....so i'm having trouble finding a new one. Just be careful if you want this one."
2,Not the best I've tried,"I have very little time in my schedule for working out, so I try to get the most out of the time I do have. This delivers a little less than I'd hoped. If you have a choice between this and anything by Cathe, go with Cathe. Once you try her, every other workout will feel like a warm-up."
5,for fantastic erections and great intercourse!,These rings work great! I actually place two of them (one adjusted slighty larger than the other with the larger one placed first) at the base of my penis while it is still soft. Hint: you may want to remove pubic hair to prevent entanglement in the rings. Sometimes I use a little lubricant to get them on easier. Then I work up my erection. I never had such rock hard erections (I am over 60). The penis really swells up for an extremely pleasurable sexual intercourse experience. Very intense orgasm! She gets more aroused also!
2,Improbable plot twists propped up by pop culture references,"I usually like dumb and fun gay novels, but this one was too dumb for me. Several of the main subplots make twists near the end that are cliche and yet completely inconsistent with the character development in the first half of the book, which made it difficult for me to finish this book. The pop culture references also seemed gratuitous, as in ""any gay person reading this book would be impressed by meeting the lead member of N-Sync."""
2,Much Like the Middle East,A confusing rehash of the same ideas over and over with never a conclusion. Obviously a slapped together set of lectures.
2,So What Went Wrong?,"I must agree with Doug and others here, Lewis does not answer the self-imposed question he leads us to believe he will answer by the very title of his book. He spends an inordinate amount of time reviewing the social, economic, artistic, and governmental differences of the Ottoman period but says next to nothing about the early Islamic empire. I was very surprised he did not mention, but for one line, the great Sunni/Sh'ia schism which is fundamental to any Islamic study. Instead Lewis asks a great many questions but gives no answers. His final paragraphs are laden with there-is-always-hope reasoning but that really does not do for what purports to be a scholarly work. All in all, quite disappointing though an interesting read for the uninitiated. Just don't expect Lewis to give you the answers he claims to promise."
5,Best book on the Middle east for a beginner,"I confess I've only read five books or so on the Islamic situation, but this one had a sweep that was so incredible, so amusing, and so authoritative that I would recommend it to anyone. I have mostly been afraid of the Islamic people after Sept. 11 -- and even broke a tooth in a dream one night while imagining fighting Bin Laden in hand to hand combat (he was winning). This book calmed me down considerably and made me like the Islamic people somewhat and see their charm, and the hope that Lewis sees in them I saw, too. All they have to do is become democratic, and liberal, and set up some better co-educational universities. Lewis argues that this is within the realm of possibility. The book gave me hope, and better than that -- understanding. I'm so grateful to Bernard Lewis!"
2,Not a very good book.,"I am an historian and a professor of history and I just finished reading this book, and I must say that as usual, Mr. Lewis presents a very simplistic and pro-islamic view of the world. Bernard Lewis is a hack for Turkey, has he ever written one critical thing about Turkey or Islam? How can anyone take him seriously as a historian when he has repeatedly attepmted to excuse the horrendous war crimes of the Young Turks and the early Kemalists regarding the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1922. Imagine a historian claiming that American slavery never existed or that the Jewish Holocoaust never occurred, he/she would be ridiculed not given a seat at Princeton. For a much more balanced view of what Islam is capable of may I reccomend The Burning Tigris by Peter Balakian."
2,Read an unabridged history instead of this book...,"This book is a ""repackaging"" of a series of lectures/papers by the author over the years. As such, it was highly repetitive, and did not present information in an orderly fashion. If you are looking for a true history of the region, I would suggest other titles by the same author which are not ""taking advantage"" of the events of 9/11..."
4,Quick delivery; some marks,quick delivery - only comment is that there were more marks than I would have expected for a like new book
2,"""What Went Wrong"" with the editing of this book?","I don't doubt that Bernard Lewis is deeply knowledgeable on this topic, but the book is not a good piece of writing. Compiled as it was from a few different lectures and papers, it circles back on itself, and does not draw any clear conclusions. I was deeply disappointed. It borders on sloppy.There are so many interesting and informative books regarding the Middle East and Islam available today. An easy and fun way to get introduced would be to read ""The Haj"", an entertaining but well-researched historical novel by Leon Uris. I picked up the official 9-11 Commission Report when stranded without other reading, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it is very well-written, deeply informative, and strikes me as non-partisan... you should read it. Finally, ""Three Cups of Tea"" by Greg Mortenson is a compelling story from an American with, probably, more experience in the region than just about anyone."
3,What Went Wrong? The Clash Betweem Oslam and Modernity in the Middle East,Lewis brings up some points that are debatable such as tolerance of religions during middle ages in Islamic areas. He would lead the reader tobelieve that Christians and Jews lived therein without any religious difficulties.
3,Shallow & repetitive,"We get pages and pages of examples of how Eastern culture decayed but no deep, *penetrating* look into why it changed the way it did. Yes, they became insular, suspicious of what they didn't understand, and regressive, but *why*? Lewis takes over 100 pages to say the same few things over and over, with lots of examples, some of which are interesting, but many of which are only repetitive. This could have been either a longer book with a bigger angle and more depth, or a shorter work, perhaps a lengthy article in a scholarly magazine. Also, he is as dull a writer as they come. Reading this, despite some good information, became a chore. In fact, you can skim after about the halfway mark. You're just getting much the same info over and over again by that point anyway. Worth a glance, but ultimately I didn't learn anything I didn't already know; I was just given many examples of the same symptoms, but no underlying explanation for the disease."
3,An Essential Point of Departure,"Lewis does a nice job laying down a framework with which to understand current world tensions. There is great historical information in the book, and a reader gets a feel for why it is that today's Muslim societies -- especially the Arab societies -- cannot stand their current predicament. These people are used to being on top, and they're searching for what went wrong. Lewis blames history, and bad decision-making. The Ottomans, one of this arguments goes, considered the West to be so inferior, they didn't even have permanent embassies in infidel cities. Because of such thinking, the subtleties of the diplomacy, statecraft, etc., are trades they're still learning. Lewis also points out that Western seafaring, and the new trade routes to Asia it opened, really hurt the Middle East, since its principalities could no longer generate revenue from traders along the Silk Road. This represents another interesting and fresh point."
2,Rambling,"The author obviously knows his subject well, however, most of the book does not really address the question raised. For the most part the book is a history of the culture and political developments of Islamic peoples. For 90% of the book he discusses literature, music, political institutions and military campaigns. The failure of Islam to enter modernity is the same failure that has afflicted other nations and empires: failure to separate church and state, failure to develop capitalism, and failure to nurture democracy. These are the same shortcomings that have brought down or stunted the growth of other nations and empires. Turkey has shown us that a nation that is 99% Moslem can also achieve modernity."
1,Very Disappointed,"I had used these loppers less than one month to trim crape myrtle branches. The bottom blade broke in two pieces. The blaeds are not all metal. They are only coated with metal. I have always trusted the Toro name, but no more. This is a very cheaply made tool. I would not advise buying it."
3,These Feel Cheap,"After trying three different loppers from Amazon, I returned these. They feel cheap. One plus it that they are light."
5,Excellent for Hypnosis,"Robert Yourell's CD's are extraordinary when used as background music for hypnosis. In my office, I use a music mixer and head phones for my clients. Without exception, my clients have reported deeper trances when my voice is accompanied with Robert's background music. If you use hypnosis in your practice, you might consider experimenting with either Up Level or Personal Journey as background music. I have used his bilateral music personally, experiencing interesting shifts in consciousness. Gary Yeatts, MSW, BCC, CHt"
3,Disappointed.,"The product that I received does not look exactly like the one featured in the picture. The shapes are the same, but the some of the panels are black. The fit is good.This is the second product that I've ordered via ""SportsRCool"", and it's the second product that arrived reeking of smoke. Clearly someone at their facility smokes and does it in the same room as the merchandise, which is weird and gross. A quick wash did not completely remove the smell."
3,Needs more songs,"While the selection of songs is good, it does need more songs added. A couple of songs from the first two albums should have made it and the singles from the Sunset Park and NJ Drive soundtracks are some of her best work."
1,Not worth the money,This DVD is not worth the money. First of all it is misleading to tell people they can be in their jeans in a week. The cueing is off and I think DVD's that have trained professionals with degrees and/or certifications offer a safer workout. There is a lot more to teaching physical fitness than looking good. No celebrity status can take the place of a degree in exercise physiology.
4,Great ball when used properly,"First and foremost make sure you secure the lid properly so it does not come off. you have to put it on and then twist to lock it in place. Our dwarf hamsters love it!!! And it is easy to clean too, well ventilated, etc...If ordering for a dwarf hammie, make sure you get the right size..."
4,Good quality,As with all hamster balls put a piece of tape or two on the lid when in use and it works great.
1,SOO ITCHY!,I remember wearing it many years ago and it was soo itchy that i had to change costumes right before the halloween party.
4,British Humor Is Better Than Hollywood,This us a nice action(spy) comedy (its more comedy than the rest). Would recommend it fir everybody but to enjoy it %100 u need to like British humor.
5,It's funny,"The movie as a whole is original and funny. The cast of characters is very diverse and I actually for a minute or two forgot to associate Rupert with Ron Weasley.Quick summation of the plot: congirl tricks art collector into buying a replica of a Rembrant, he finds out and hires assassin to take her out, the assassin develops feelings for her after observing her daily activities (it's pretty funny to watch her pick pocket and steal without breaking her stride), when he fails to kill her the art collector sends his goons after her to finish the job, the assassin sees her about to get killed by one of the goons and saves her life. Then the story gets a lot more complicated and interesting from there. Ok so maybe it's not THAT original. But it's a really funny different spin on the basic elements of the story.I will say this though: how is it that every time a classic Mini Cooper is in a movie it seems to always steal my heart?"
3,Mild Target,"An efficient but repressed hitman(Bill Nighy) who always gets his man meets his match with a kooky thief (Emily Blunt, whose star continues to rise) who has more lives than the Roadrunner. Both run a afoul of a sadistic gangster (Rupert Everett). Throw in the mix a kid (Rupert Grint) who may or may not have been at the wrong place at the wrong time. A nice mix of Ealing and screwball that ultimately is as memorable as fish and chips. Not bad but had the potential to be better."
4,Olympus D490 vs Nikon 885,"Comparison: Yes I know that I am comparing 2MP vs 3MP cameras, but in comparing the sharpness of the pictures between the two, the 885 wins hands down. The menu system of the D490 is simpler, but that is because the 885 has a ton more features so more menus. The 885 is smaller, lighter, & fits in the hand better. Finally, I like the integrated lens cover of the D490 much better. Overall: Nikon 885!Pros: Great pictures, 3MP, ergonomics, uses Compactflash cards, USB file transferCons (hence 4/5 stars): (...) for 2 rechargable batteries, recharger, & 128MB Lexar 8X Compactflash card (which I highly recommend, otherwise wait 12 seconds, with a Sandisk CF card, before you can take another picture, instead of 5 seconds with the Lexar 8X)"
4,pretty good book,"It was a good book. It didn't follow all of the elements of the games correctly, but all in all, it was pretty good."
3,Underrated rock and roll band....,"Southgang came out a little too late and missed being a part of a great era of music. This disk surfaced in 1992. Had it come out in 1987, it would've gone platinumWorth picking up if you dig the glam metal style music. These boys from Rome, GA do it a with a southern twang. Some absolute classic on here. ""Fire In Your Body"" and ""Best Friends Girl"" are great - but ""The Call"" and ""Misery"" back to back, melting into one long song, are the highlights of this disk. Worth it for those two tunes alone."
3,It's not Pac-Man!,"I was disappointed to find that the game has nothing to do with Pac-Man. Luckily, I like board games, so I will enjoy it with my kids. But I was hoping for an old school Pac-Man game (I guess I'm showing my age). However, my husband brought home a real Pac-Man game called Namcomuseum. So now we can enjoy both."
1,no shine,"This book was so overrated. The Overlook Hotel's past was interesting, but too much detail about unneccesary subjects."
4,Great stuff,"I read a few Stephen King's work such as Carrie, Needful Things, Cell, Different Seasons, Thinner, Misery. I am not sure why I didn't start with some of his stronger work like The Shinning. So, I went into The Shinning with a very high expectation. I am glad to say that it met my expectations and more. In his other works, I find that he is long winded and spent a lot of time on details of each character. And so I was hoping that The Shinning isn't like that. And it isn't. Unlike his later works, The Shinning strike a balance between character development without going into all the unnecessary details. It was so encouraging that I went and bought 'Salem's Lot. I hope this early classic delivers as well."
4,Shining,"It's very good, I love how much detail it has versus the movie. There is so much more to the story. Love it!"
5,The Best,"Stephen King's ""The Shining"" is a perfect novel. It's not only the best SK book EVER, but the best horror novel EVER. I've always been a huge fan of his work ever since I read this book, so if you read this one, you'll be highly tempted to read more which I also highly advise."
3,Caribou in Colorado?,"This book is good, but long-winded. I didn't find it scary in the least. I thought Apt Pupil was creepy as hell, but The Shining just didn't give me the chills. Topiary animals aren't scary to me. But - the most glaring thing in the book is the mention of caribou in Colorado. Caribou don't live south of the Arctic Circle. How did King and his editors allow this error to make it to print? Another thing that I see as a common theme in King's works - the children are always way too advanced for their age. I think Danny should have been at least a couple years older than five. And Jack Sawyer in the Talisman should have been older than twelve. Just my opinion."
5,AMAZINGGGGG,Everything was PERFECT! It arrived just in time and the book looks just as good as a brand new book!
4,A great title,"I really enjoyed the book. As pointed out in the intro by KIng (and by the last review) this book has a lot simplier prose than later books, but its just so good! Things intertwine, the characters are strong,the stroy is well-paced. And, 'o course, its scary. Its a great way to start off on KIng books."
4,Macabre haunted house story.,"He is the master of the macabre for a reason. This story gives you goosebumps and sleepless nights. I found this book had original plot elements that made an old story seem new, and the ending is horrific. Recommend even if you are not a Stephen King fan!"
5,The Ultimate Cabin Fever,"This is the first novel of King work that I read. I had first seen the Kubrick movie and I was scared to death. I had to read the book. I was surprised at the differences. As I got further along in the story, I felt I was inside the minds of these three characters. The dillusions, the voices, the ghosts, the masks. When I completed this novel, I was still thinking about it for hours after. What struck me as the most frightening was that somthing like this COULD happen! Not the SHINING that Danny possessed, of course, but the mental breakdown of this man, stuck in a huge hotel for months with no one but his wife and young son. The mind is a powerful force. It can make you believe things that aren't real. You'll hear things that aren't there to be heard. You'll see things that aren't there to be seen. King goes into a lot of reality with this book, and the mind can be the scariest monster of all. I HIGHLY recommend this novel as a first KING read."
5,The Best King Book. Period.,"King scares at his best in The Shining. The book starts off kind of slow explaining the past and why Jack, Wendy and Danny are going to live in the Overlook hotel all winter. But as soon as Jack trims the hedge animals you cannot put the book down. Literally! I'm not your usual reader, I spend at most 3 hours a week reading but while reading this book I was spending every evening reading for at least two hours! I urge...no I demand any King fan who hasn't read this to READ IT! And anyone who loves the horror genre to read this book too (especially if you think you can't be scared from a book). This is by far (IMO) Stephen King's best and scariest book. Period."
4,scarier than the movie; prepare for some sleepless nights!,"Having read the book first, I was a bit disappointed with the movie, because of the book's greater detail and superior storyline. Perhaps not the ""masterpiece in modern horror"" as advertised on the paperback cover, but neverthless a good read which will make you check all the dark places in your bedroom before turning out the lights."
4,The Shinning,Another thrilling novel by Stephen king. The Shinning is a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a story about a man named Jack Torrance and his family Wendy and Danny. They just move to this town and Jack got a job at the Overlook Hotel. They have no idea what they have got themselves into.
3,Good for a thrill,Definitely gets in to the heads of the characters better than the Kubrick film. Though I say they're about equally as good as each other. Worth a read.
5,"Works well, didn't need PoE","I recently bought a LCD TV that has an Ethernet connection to get on the internet. I dreaded the thought of running a cable to the TV. After looking around for an easier solution I found this and once I set it up as an ""access client"" it worked great. If you can set up a wireless router you will have no problem with the set up. It can be used on anything that has an Ethernet connection. I tested it on an older laptop that is just wireless B (11 Mbps), I disabled the wireless on the laptop and just connected the Trendnet to the laptop and now it is much faster on the internet. I also plan on using it on my new Blu-ray player that has the Netflix capability. I misunderstood the PoE feature as being able to draw power through the Ethernet cable like with USB devices, I was wrong and spent $10 more than I had to. Oh-well, lesson learned. Get the ""TEW-430APB"" unless you really have PoE."
5,The very best if you want to frail,"This is the only banjo instruction book that I'm aware of that would eventually enable a complete novice to the banjo to learn how to frail. In fact, even if you have never played a musical instrument before, after a few weeks practicing with the aid of this book, and the accompanying tape, you'll be able to get the hang of it. The practice songs are set up from easy to difficult and the tablature is easy to read and follow. Highly recommended."
4,Hilarious,My sisters hamster could run around in this track all day! Its so funny to watch. Im actually sort of jealous i didnt come up with this idea haha.
2,GreatForLittleKids,"This is a rather mindless story, but the visuals are awfully cute.The figures themselves bring smiles to adult faces. Great for children 0 to 4"
3,Messner is the King of the Mountains,"Hail to the king of the mountaineers! Read about Messner's climb of K2 without oxygen - an amazing feat even for today's best-conditioned climbers. I'm continually amazed of Reinhold's incredible fitness and knack for survival. He survived so many adventures in some of the world's toughest places. Lance Armstrong is a super human cyclist, and Reinhold Messner is a super human mountaineer. The greatest thing about his success is that he survived all of his epic climbs. It is a 3-4 star book, but a 5-plus star adventure.For another book with tales of adventure on a more ""recreational"" scale, try ""Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection.""Note to Amazon: You may delete my other, older review if you would like to."
3,La Symphonie Pastorale,La Symphonie Pastorale depicts the tale of a pasteur who takes in a young blind girl (Gertrude). The story concerns the ramifications of his involvement in her education and her life. The film sides on the melodramatic and certain physical qualites of both the Pasteur and Gertrude make their roles difficult to believe.
3,Amazon reviewer misses the mark... but still a good album,"Songs For Silverman showcases more of Ben Folds' talent than any other album to date. Unfortunately, it does little more. There's something very obvious missing from this album: fun. Ben Folds Five was an upbeat musical outfit, and this energy initially carried over to Ben's solo career. Songs For Silverman, while more ""musically correct,"" lacks the intensity of previous efforts. It's that X-factor that made Ben Folds' so popular in the first place, and one which does not, as some have suggested, have to pass with age. There are some catchy tunes on this disc, particularly ""You To Thank."" But I would recommend ""true Folds' fans"" to spend their money on the recently released remastered version of Whatever & Ever Amen."
4,Songs for Silverman,"Songs for Silverman is yet another solid release from one of my generation's best pianist/songwriter. He's turning more into a 70's Elton John or Billy Joel, but he's updated the setup for our times.The songs are a little more slower than usual; he's missing the dumb peppy goofiness of some of his earlier albums. This album feels more personal and more authentic.Ben's definitely getting older and it's cool watching him ""grow up"". He makes great music for us nerdy white guys!"
4,Does not play in computer,Dual Disc is ONE disc that wont play in a computer (which means you can't import to iTunes) and plays in some cars. BIG BUMMER of a disappointment.
2,Poor Ben,"Well I'll be the first one to admit the truth about this cd. I'm not impressed. It sucks. Ben is great, but his albums have steadily gone downhill since ""Whatever and Ever Amen"".Unfortunately it all boils down to songwriting. Ben sounds great and the music SOUNDS like I should like it...it just falls flat most of the time.It almost sounds like Ben is trying to be Elton John back in the 70's. I think it backfired. ""Late"" is about the only song on here worth listening to more than once. Most of his songs are starting to sound the same to me. He needs a new producer or something. I don't know."
1,"love the album, doesn't import to itunes","I wish I could put this on my ipod, but because of it's dualdisc nonsense it's the ben album I hear the least because who carries around a cd player anymore?"
5,Ben is peaking,i've followed Ben Folds for a few years now. i consider him a genuine talent on the keys. he sits comfortably between Elton John and Billy Joel.SFS positions him as a talented songwriter in addition to his prowess with the piano. SFS is well built and will be a lasting part of my library. good good stuff.just saw him in New York City. he was at his absolute best. see him if you can. pick up SFS and you will be looping 'Landed' and 'Sentimental Guy' over and over as i have been. or maybe i'm just enamored by the talent of Ben Folds.check it out.
5,Awesome Squared,"Ben Folds has done it again. I thought he was awesome after going solo with Suburbs, but this is awesome squared. Been a fan of ""the band"" since their first cd and I must say since going on his own, he has only proved that he can do it alone. Buy this cd. Its the feel good cd of the year. It will make you laugh, think, and love the music of the genius Mr. Folds."
4,Change is not always bad,"I've read a few of these reviews, saying how this album is bad because it doesn't sound like his previous albums. Yet, I find it funny that if it did sound like previous albums there would be reviews complaining that he has no originality.Honestly, I think it's a great album. No, it's not as upbeat as Ben's previous albums. It's a matured Folds you hear on this album, one who has written beautiful songs with meaning to them. I recommend this CD for anyone not afraid to hear a little bit of a different side of Folds."
2,Not this one,"I returned this book in favor of 600 Modern Greek Verbs, which I highly recommend. This book uses a hard-to-read font and is poorly printed, so it is very difficult to use."
4,Great fun!,"I bought this book for a pre-K to K aged storytime I lead, and it was a great way to introduce Chinese New Year to the kids. It was even more fun to read alone with my own preschooler, as she could lift the flaps herself (always a bonus)! The rhyming text makes it fun to read, as the story follows a family getting ready for Chinese new Year. Includes a Chinese Zodiac wheel and instructions for making a dragon puppet."
3,Not for children younger than 2,"The flaps are very thin and small, and are easily torn off by children younger than 2. A great book for learning about the Chinese New year, geared to an older toddler. I'd recommend ages 2 1/2 up."
5,Vanishing Steam,This product is for rail fans & steam train enthusiasts alike. Watching the trains which were retired before I was born was a wonderful experience.
4,An excellent and enjoyable read!,"This book touched close to my heart. I too, like the central character Paul, have played the piano since I was very young. To fully understand this book, you must listen to the music in it, especially the sad, emotive music that Keller can not stand due to his Plato's originally theory that the beautiful can tell lies. Everything in the book seems to play some significance. Even the bar at which Keller lives above because of its name - The Swan (plays a big role in the Wagner's Ring Cycle).The story lines in the book are terrific. Keller knows that Paul's piano playing is lacking something, and yet ""that small something may as well of been everything"".I recommend this book to anyone."
1,Pointless and Infuriating.,"While the writing itself isn't bad, the selfish and arrogant protagonist makes for a frustrating book. Readers are privy to Paul's lifelong transformation of an ignorant, voyeuristic teenager into an aimless adult who, by his own doing, ultimately achieves nothing. You continue reading in the hope of a dramatic turn around in his attitude towards himself and those around him only to discover there isn't one. The most interesting part of the story is that of Herr Keller, Paul's piano teacher, but because of Paul's inability to consider anything outside himself and his own piano playing, Keller's journey is dismissed until the final pages.In short, unbearably annoying and solely about failure. I only hope to deter any poor soul contemplating buying this book."
5,picture does not do doll justice,"if the image with this listing was not so bad, this doll wodul be long gone. she has wonderful hair and face paint and the colors of her outfit really pop!"
2,Embarrassing,"I believe that chemical sensitivity is real, but this book has too many factual and typographical errors to be useful either as a textbook or for persuading skeptics. It's good for idea generation if you have a good enough education to spot the errors."
4,Bill's Review,"As a person who enjoys classical music but has not been trained in that field, I greatly enjoyed this book. Several times, statements by the author sent me to an internet site, such as Wikipedia, to confirm that what he had stated was true. I was not sure if it was tongue-in-cheek or factual; turns out all the things I looked up were factual. That is the charm of this book. The author tells the reader things in such an outrageously funny manner that one does not know for sure whether to believe it or not. Well, believe it! That's the fun. I know two classically trained musicians, my wife and her sister, who both have read this book, and have also found it to be very amusing, fun, and easy to read.Whether you are a trained musician, or just a music lover, I recommend this book."
3,I'm sure,"I'm sure that the material is very fun to read. My library has an online copy of this and that's how I got access to it. There was one name in my general music history class that our professor stressed for us to spell right and it was that of Johannes Ockeghem. Now, as I was reading the chapter on Josquin des Prez, the word O-K-E-G-H-E-M jumps out at me like a cat out of water. If you're going to include tne name of a composer, at least spell his name right."
3,I would give it 3 1/2 but it wasnt an option,This is crazy...I like it! I dont think that I have ever heard anything like this. Its a little creepy but I love that. I think that I will buy it. This is the type of music that has to grow on u but once it does your hooked. I first heard this lyrical threesome on the Parent Trap remake soundtrack that I bought in 5th grade....Glad I did....
4,Good Book - DVD almost useless,"The information provided in the book is well organized and does a good job of explaining steps and strategies. I would recommend the book without hesitation. However, if like me, you buy it thinking the DVD would be a good way to supplement the material, you'll probably be disappointed.While the DVD does cover the different areas of the test, it does so fairly superficialy and it's easy to watch the entire disk in one sitting, because it's so short. So if the DVD might otherwise give this the edge over another alternative, it shouldn't, although the book will stand on its own merits."
4,Good introductory book.,"I bought this book as a required text for a upper level undergraduate course in Abstract Algebra. I found the book to be a very good source for examples and problems. Many of the problems have solutions in the back which is a good feature. The book is thourough, rigorous, and at the same time easy to read. The ideas and concepts are presented so naturally that you almost forget you are reading a mathematics text."
4,Great story but...,"I liked the anime quite a lot but as with a fair amount of them it seemed like the ending was rushed. Up to the end it was great, a bit bloody but that should be expected with a name like Blade of the Immortal. I would assume (though I have not read the manga) that this is only about half way through the story, maybe a bit more maybe a bit less. I will not say more as I don't want to give spoilers. But I would search out the manga for an ending, I will do so myself. Though it is a great anime and I would highly suggest checking it out!"
1,Inaccurate,"This series of novels is inaccurate. Moses never existed, and thus could not have been present. The exodus did not occur, and thus could not have happened when Ramses was king."
4,"Odd, but compelling","This is definitely an odd album with a mixture of Primus-sounding and Phish-sounding songs as mentioned in the other reviews.I do believe that the lyrics and sound make for an overall darker album than I had expected. I find ""The Grand Pecking Order"" reminiscent of some early Pink Floyd albums, such as ""A Saucerful of Secrets,"" and ""Obscured by Clouds,"" all of which are an eclectic mix of weirdness, darkness, psychedelia, and some catchy tunes. Les Claypool is definitely a fan of Pink Floyd, and it shows on this album.Overall, I enjoyed the sound of the album and would recommend it to anyone into Primus, Phish, or Floyd."
5,A must for any music fan,"Oysterhead's ""The Grand Pecking Order"" is one of those CDs you slap in and listen to over and over again. Trey's guitar is almost unrecognizable in this power trio, but this makes it all the better. Les obviously fronts the band; he does the lyrics for almost all the songs. Any fan of Primus can identify Claypool's aggressive slap bass and this album is no exception. Coupled with Trey's guitar, the listener gets the sense that the band had a lot of fun recording.Stewart's drumming could be considered the ""weak point."" However, there is nothing bad about it. He actually keeps the other two musicians in line. His drums keep the other two from going into prolonged jams. Stewart's drumming is also better than most.Anyone who enjoys Phish will love this album, although the sound is entirely different. In interviews, the entire band agreed Oysterhead is more of a fun project. The listener can easily hear their joy in playing."
4,Virtuos,"A superband with a super album. When great veterans like these get together on a cd like this, you know it's going to be good. It's a very original brand of funk-jam. Check it out."
1,What? Were they thinking?,"Love Phish. Love Police. Love Primus. Despise this album. There might be some interesting socio-political themes but I wouldn't bother to try to find out. Somewhat spacey but lacking everything that's charming about (for example) yoshima/pink robots. This is a non-concept album.If three ""un-famous"" names recorded this, it would never see the light of day. Here is why.Characterless processed vocals. Directionless music. Someone could hear the bass on this? I could not. Dance music for the bedridden. Leon Redbone (or Tom Waits) played at double-speed. The Chipmonks' tribute to the Fugs. Mothers of Invention without Zappa (and certainly without Anastasio). Horribly misconceived.Maybe this is a great album but simply sounds totally unlike my memory of any of the people involved. Maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe not.Unlistenable. Bad trip music. Devo on toy instruments. Gaga for Dada. In-A-Gaga-da-Dada. Save your money, or buy any other album but this one."
2,"Hate to Bring the ""Average Customer Review"" Down....but","**.5I was unpleasantly surprised upon my initial spin.It falls somewhere between a fair Phish lp and a ""good"" Primus rave-up. There's little here that hasn't been done before to better effect on either of the two band's releases mentioned above. Why no new ground was explored here is baffling to me.Furthermore, there is not a single INSTRUMENTAL cut on this disc. Why?With such a plethora of soloing talent and the ability to noodle about in a positive way, it's almost criminal. Instead, we have more silly and self-indulgent muzak.Hopefully, their next outing, if we should hope so high, will have at least some flashes of originality and brilliance.Oysterhead leaves me with the impression that this trio had nothing better to do at the time and just let the tape roll."
5,great sound and very comfortable,these buds are soo comfortable and the sound is great! these buds have great clarity and bass. the bass is not as good as expensive ones but if i were to rate the bass it would be 3/4 points. the memory foam buds are very comfortable after you break them in after about an hour of use. people complain they are too big but u just have to READ the instructions and compress them to a smaller size then let them expand in your ears. i rate these buds 5/5 stars
2,Too tinny,"Don't like these, more expensive than the the Gumy ones, but the sound is tinny, too much top, too little bass. Don't find them very comfortable or that great at cutting ambient noise either. Prefer Gumy, better bass, nicer sound."
1,Not compatible with just keyboard,"Chords used not compatible with keyboard where a bass has to be played due to split section of KB. Also music designed for an orchestra as it is divided into seperate sections for various instruments and drum solos. Too complicated. Was expecting that the music would include ""riffs"" or runs already written out but found none. Maybe ideal for professional musicians already in a band, but not for individual keyboardists gig."
2,A White Elephant at Best,"Full of puzzles and dark fables, plus a twisted bit of pedantry, this book did not meet my expectations. I was hoping for something beautiful but instead got something sickly and unsatisfying. The author had many themes that I enjoyed, but mostly I came away with a bad taste in my mouth."
5,"Great book, I hope he writes more","The Gift is everything I ever wanted from a good fantasy/science fiction book. The writing is just as good if not better than his first book, Door Number Three, which was also an amazing book. O'Leary knows how to write a good story which keeps the readers attention."
5,Enchanting fantasy,"I was drawn to Patrick O'Leary's second novel by Tom Canty's always wonderful cover art. I brought it home from the bookstore and thought I'd read a chapter or two. The Gift drew me in and before I knew it, it was nearing 2 am and I had read it all the way through.The Gift is one of those novels that you cannot put down. O'Leary paints a picture every bit as vivid as that on the cover. Writing as emotionally evocative as O'Leary's has in my experience been almost entirely the domain of women authors.I have already read this book twice in less than a year and I know I'll read it again and again."
4,Masterful,"Patrick O'Leary weaves a masterful tapestry of magic and wonder in 'The Gift'.He is clearly a master of the English language. Every sentence evokes wonderful imagery. This is one of those books where I was on the edge of my chair throughout.There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been mentioned in previous reviews. It's a fantastic book. I disagree with the previous reviewer, it can please people coming from different viewpoints. A Robert Jordan fan will enjoy the magic and the evil crows and the magnificent quest..whereas more sophisticated readers can appreciate the subtler nuances.Those of us who enjoy all kinds of fiction can sit back and bask in a wonderful experience."
1,Disjointed and Unsatisfying,"The story just did not fit together well at all. It also had a confusing narrative style that detracted from the overall storyline. I found it infantile, at best."
5,If you love Teddy Bears....,"If you love teddy bears you must have this book. The illustrations of bears in action are adorable. This cook book has inspired two parties that I had for my son. And, we also decorated our window seat to look like the ""Rainy Day Picnic"" scene. There are plenty of creative ideas to help you plan a lovely day with your children and teddy bears."
4,A Good Read !!,"I likes this book alot. I liked that the characters were very emotional and thought out. I hope there is a sequel, as I wanted to read more about some of the supporting characters."

3,Sturdy but Discolors Fur,Chain is sturdy and durable but it has discolored my dogs fur like cheap jewelry would do to a human. I can wash of the discoloration but would have expected better quality such this didn't happen.
4,The new voice of common sense,"This is a wonderful book that covers just about everything-the war on drugs, affirmative action, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the race wars. Larry Elder does a fantastic job of displaying how multiculturalism, big government, and a senseless bureaucracy are eating away what makes this country great.I enjoy reading books from non-white voices that cover issues of race and sexism and class, so I can rest assured that I'm not just an ""angry white man,"" as Phil Gone-a-hue puts it.Larry paints a very optimistic future-IF, however, the government takes about 10 steps back and gives more freedom in every area of life, and letting the public learn from their mistakes instead of handing out entitlements. Great read from my favorite libertarian!"
5,El inconsciente social de una época,"La novela gira en torno a las emociones y decisiones de tres hermanos. Siendo las vidas de Aliocha, el menor de los hermanos, e Iván, el segundo, las que manifiestan los rasgos más profundos y crudos por momentos. Las disertaciones demenciales de Iván para con quien supuso el diablo (o un mero producto de su imaginaciòn), o las elecciones siempre altruistas aunque conflicitivas de Aliocha que entra al sacerdocio, son los componentes que revelan la cruda realidad de una Rusia previa a la Revolución Bolchevique. A todo esto, los asesinatos de Dimitri, el mayor de los Karamazov, elevan la novela al sitial de clàsico de la literatura universal."
2,something missing,"it was a good book with great writing but I never really liked Phoebe or Faith. I found the reason as to why Faith left, unplausable. Phoebe goes to Europe to retrace her sister's steps and miraculously shows up on the doorstep of the last person that Faith was with. I also found myself skipping lines."
3,"Good reading, but not what I'd consider classic","This book gets off to a slow start, and I initially didn't think I'd finish it. The story becomes much more interesting once Phoebe, the main character, goes to Europe. The high point of the story is when she travels to Italy with Wolf, the boyfriend of her deceased older sister. I think the story should have ended when she found out how her sister died, or shortly afterwards. The ending of the book is very weak, and almost seems as if it has been added on to fulfill a required page length for the manuscript. Despite this, it's a good book and I'd recommend it to others. I wouldn't put it on my list of favorites or classics, however."
3,We're Advised this Racquet is Too Heavy,"My daughter is taking summer tennis lessons. She is nine years old. The instructors have repeatedly advised this racquet is too heavy and that the weight is impairing her performance. So, I guess we'll have to get her a different one. I wish I would have known this in advance as it is not only the money, but the lost time and the lessons which are rendered less effective since she is not properly equipped."
4,Very Good Read,"The central theme of this book stretches the imagination somewhat, but the author pulls it off quite well, and creates a real page turner. Lots of spy vs. spy action on land, and also lots of sub vs. sub encounters at sea. Chechen terrorists, the Russian and US Navies, along with the CIA are all involved in a story with many unexpected twists and turns in the plot. However, the plot could use more detail in the dialog that takes place in the submarines combat control centers. And, a couple more maps located in the text where the action takes place, would really help."
3,NOT hot-swap on 03 server,"have 3 of these... none are hot-swap in 2003 server (or sbs2003), but they do work. there is a rosewill sold cheaper that is EXACTLY the same card."
5,A must for marathoners!!!,"I bought this book while I was training for my first marathon (Honolulu) 2 years ago. I have since run LA and NYC, and plan on running as many more as my body will allow.This book has been the backbone of inspiration for me. I keep it by my bedside and read it constantly. I have numerous pages folded down of marathons I would never have known of, but now plan on running, thanks to this book.The authors have done an incredible job detailing so many marathons - you absolutely will not be disappointed if you purchase this book!!!"
4,Great Buy,"This textbook is considered out of print but my Professor still teaches from it word for word. Taking notes in this man's class is hand cramping, the book is a perfect study guide. As a plus it was much cheaper than any of my other books and was in excellent condition."
1,toxic,"The product is described as 'Childs Snow White Costume'. The package actually has it as 'Shrek 3 Princess'. The crown that's pictured with a Medium size, is not what you're getting. It's the one that comes with Small and Large size. The issue is that the crown flakes and smells toxic. The smell was so strong, that after two minutes, I had to put it back in the plastic bag it came in. The dress had threads and stitches coming out here and there. The detachable sleeves, were barely holding on to the tiny piece of velcro.For the reasons mentioned above, I've sen't it back the same day I got it."
5,Amazing! I have been waiting 2 years for this to come to dvd!,"Me and my wife went to see this movie at black harvest in Chicago in 2008. This film blew everything out of the water! We bought the pass so we can see alot of independent movies but the only one we clearly remember and follow is this film! Prince Adu is amazing. This film captures the true human spirit of each situation perfectly. Who ever rated this film 3 stars is crazy! or maybe just a film snob. This review is coming from someone who loves films like City of God, Rockers, and films as such. You will not be disappointed! Trust me!"
3,Wonderfully Educational; Horrribly Bound,"This is one of four course texts for my Senior Seminar course at Regent University and while it is proving to be quite useful in research and my studies, I was so horribly bothered in the first couple hours of reading that I am now leaving my first feedback for a textbook. Within the first two hours of opening this book and reading it, pages 9-20 fell out. Just to put this out there, I am an avid reader and adore my book collection so I strive to take great precaution in my handling of books, but the pages were merely spread when this happened and talk about frustrating. I hope I can make it through the rest of the book without having this issue again but it's hard to say at this point."
2,Interesting reading,I would not be able to recommend this book. Seems like this book was written by a feminist who was looking for evidence to prove some of today's progressive misconceptions-- women are somehow superior to men- sexual orientation is a result of training.Lol. You must be kidding?!Many ideas presented in this book are completely contrary to obvious evidence of nature. One must delve deeply into one's own mind to believe it.
5,Better than Casio's original,Works great at a fraction of what Casio wants to charge for their useless battery. Great buy!
3,"Scanner is great, support is just awful","The Microtek 4800 scanner is a great buy, as long as it installs perfectly the first time. I have Windows XP, and one reason I chose this scanner is it's supposed to be compatible. Not hardly. Between two computer professionals, we couldn't get it to work. After several phone calls and numerous e-mails, we were told the problem was very complicated and we should use the premium (pay) support. This was before the 30 day free support period ended. We finally got into the registry and got it working. I do like the performance and features, just beware if you have XP or any unique setup..."
2,Windows XP Problems,"The scanner at first installed fine, but after rebooting the sdii.exe file would force the CPU usage to 100% making all programs unusable. I uninstalled and reinstalled the software with the same results. I went to the Microtek website and downloaded the new 5.76 driver. Again, sometimes the scanner would function correctly and sometimes the sdii.exe file would cause the CPU usage to reach 100%.The Microtek tech department was no help. After being on hold for 20 minutes, I spoke with an installation expert who could not help me and tranferred me to an ""advanced"" tech expert. This call resulted in a recorded message. Needless to say, I was dissapointed with the tech support.I later tried installing the scanner on a different computer with a different USB cable and got the same 100% CPU usage rate.If anyone else is experiencing this problem, ..."
5,deep soul,"DAVID SYLVIAN & ROBERT FRIPP-this cd is absolutely one of my favorites. it mixes humorous lyrics with soul-searching ones... Sylvian has been one of my very favorite musical artists for almost fifteen years now. as an old boyfriend of mine once said, Sylvian is God...this boyfriend introduced me to Sylvian so i will be indebted to him for this...in fact, everything Sylvian has put out is excellent. My favorite single on this cd is DARSHAN...with Robert Fripp's eerie and soulful guitar rifts combined with Sylvian's silky voice, this cd is well worth the price of admission ten-fold...I recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent time!!!"
5,One of the best...,I think this is one of the very best cuts you get of George Benson. This shows why George Benson is one of the best jazz guitarists in history...burnin'!!
5,Excellent book to come up to speed on Oracle/VB,"I'm relatively experienced with VB and accessing databases although I had never connected to an Oracle DB. With a new project starting, I had to come up to speed. This book showed me how much I didn't know what I thought I knew. It felt like it was written just for me - from the perspective of someone who has been happily accessing jet db's and thinking the every db works that way. Now I understand how the ""big boys"" work and this information has proved invaluable in my project. Highly recommened."
1,Disappointed in product,"I ordered this product after reading the description. Based on the description, the product appeared to be an excellent guide for travelers in Europe. I am very disappointed to find, after looking at the product, that this product doesn't really deliver. If you are travelling to Europe and don't want to get lost, don't count on this product to deliver you to your desired destination."
3,Wow! So many people seem to not understand this guide!,"Reading the reviews of people who bought this guide for traveling in Europe, it makes me wonder just what the heck they were thinking. So many who posted bad reviews seemed to think that this guide was created to not only tell them about a place of interest, restaurant or hotel...but also navigate them to the place? Not so! This is just a basic travel guide. Nothing more, nothing less. If you want your Garmin GPS device to actually navigate you to a desired place in Europe, you'd better have a Garmin that already has the European maps installed! Perhaps if people would bother to actually READ the full description first, it would save them a LOT of hassles and misunderstandings. This guide is okay, for what it is. It would be nice if there was a way to periodically update the information though."
1,"Yeah, I got taken","I bought this item and the mustard squirt bottle for my grandchildren. In the past I have purchaced them from a magic store and had no problems. The cord inside the bottle would always shoot out about 2 feet to surprize the person you are using it on. This one from Zowie, only dribbles out a few inches. This will not alarm anyone that catcup could be streaming out at them. I tried to get a refund as I was very disappointed, but was told "" sorry "" that's the way the product is suppose to work, so it is not defective and therefore no refund. Yeah for me, now I either have to try again w/another company, look around for a longer cord or just throw it away. Now, I know you get what you pay for and $3 isn't much; however, I do expect the trick to work. Wouldn't that be nice. So do you think I'll buy from Zowie again?"
3,needs some design attention,"Design flaws in metal brace that make it dig into forearm and palm on me and I am a small. Delivery was much later than estimated.The brace needs two people to help put it on, unless one is ambidextrous. I'm not.Suede is nice and breathes unlike plastic, and inner lining is soft and comfortable except where metal inside is bent in which does put uncomfortable pressure on area of forearm and palm of hand.Probably could lever it up with pliers, but have added flannel to cushion contact areas.I was offered 1/2 of the price back in refund to buy back my first review. I felt strange about taking back my honest opinion, but asked for instructions on how to do it. The instructions came couched in a letter that was rather rude and impatient in tonal quality. I don't know if tone was intentional or not. Regardless, I really did not want to sell my opinion. You have it above."
3,Feels Like Home,"An underrated and very interesting record, ""Homebrew"" is a fine effort that wisely captures the musical zeitgeist of the early nineties. Creative and diverse, Neneh Cherry`s sophomore release combines pop, soul, rap, dance, spoken-word and, most importantly, is one of the first albums that presents some songs that origin the genre known as trip-hop. Although a bit uneven, this is still a landmark record that manages to be relevant today. Some of the hip-hop oriented tracks are a tad dated now, but the electronic and sophisticated ballads ""Move With Me"", ""Peace in Mind"", ""Somedays"" and ""Red Paint"" are as excellent as ever. An unnoticed gem worth discovering, ""Homebrew"" as much to recommend.Worthwile music."
1,Cheap fake leather,"I did not receive a chair by Coaster Home Furnishings but instead another company and when I tried to find this company and chair ID number on Amazon it did not exist. This chair looks similar but it is very cheap looking,(not leather as described) I am embarrassed to have it in my home. I can not return this chair because the packaging it arrived in was so beat up and retaped several times. I left the tags on it and saved the paperwork because this chair did not come with anything that says Coaster Havana Retro Style LEATHER Sofa Club Chair Recliner anywhere. I have made several other purchases with Amazon that exceeded my expectation but this......I am very disappointed."
5,Great Repair Manual,I own a 40HP 4 Stroke Yamaha engine and even though I owen the Factory maintenance manual This book goes into much more detail and gives better drawings
4,"Yamaha Marine Engine, Seloc Manual Review","A very comprehensive, hands-on, detailed manual for a plethora of four-stroke Yamaha and related marine engines. Highly recommend.Yamaha Outboard Series Yamaha Outboards All Eng. 1997-05"
3,lost along the way......,"Being a HUGE OMD fan I always felt as though something was a little off on this album. Only now do I have the problem nailed down. This album was simply Over-Produced. There is a core element to the songs that on some of the tracks gets lost along the way by means of Rave-Techno production. But even at that this album is still very good. Although it&#65533;s not quite up there With Architecture and Morality, Sugar Tax or universal. The real Stand out tracks on this album would have to Be ""Christine"" and ""The Best Years Of Our Lives"". Is it worth owning? - Yes. Just don&#65533;t break the bank to get it. If you&#65533;re new to OMD I recommend the singles collection so you might know which era of OMD suits you best."
3,Canyon Adams Was Right,"I recently read a book by Mr. Canyon Adams entitled ""Addiction in the White House: Disgrace of the U.S. Presidency."" The book was excellent! And since Mr. Adams dedicated the book to Gennifer Flowers (and Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey)I found myself becoming interested in Gennifer's story. So I bought this book. I like this book too. Gennifer, I believe your story. Mr. Adams pointed out your credibility, and the President's sickness, and now I see things from your perspective. When I approached your book, I found it very believeable and credible. Good luck, Ms. Flowers. As your book points out, you paid a big price for your freedom from the presidential scandal."
5,Quite Believable,"I read this book as a skeptic. However, in spite of a lot of sleazy details I found Ms. Flowers very believable. Hats off for having the courage to write this in-depth look at the dark and seamy side of this man."
3,Cameroon,The movie itself is good. Just have problems with the DVD disk on it. At the beginning of the Disk the scenes are broken up and you can't see the movie at it's beginning.
1,Re-ordered this shirt since I liked the first one so much however it turned out to be make out of a cheap polyester.,"I was so pleased with the first shirt that I thought it would be wise to order a few more while they have free shipping.To my shock I received a mirror image shirt made out of a very thin polyester which wrinkles when washed.Sweat sticks to this one, not like the first one which was perfect for exercising.So, out of the shirts I receiveed only the first order was as stated.They others seem to be a cheap polyester knock-off.Very disappointing."
5,Blessed is those who read this book,"We are taught what alot of people think and what alot of beleivers think , When I read this book I know what our LORD thinks . Iam not comfused about what is eternal and what is temperory after reading the beatitudes but I sure was . What is the truth ? most of us do not know it ."
5,Skin Medica Uplifting eye serum,I really like to product. It reduces the eye pufiness quickly and efficiently. I love it! I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Absolutely love this series!,"After reading the first in the series I immediately downloaded the next. Getting to know the characters, and following them through their triumphs and struggles is quite an experience. It was as though I was right there with them, rooting for them or crying with them. Excellent series in my opinion."
2,Royal she is not!,"This is a somewhat hard to find R&B cd that is from the actress of Moesha/The Parkers fame, it's not bad for a first attempt but it fails to be of any real substance, it has it's moments but mostly falls flat, the music sounds dated and tends to sound the same, not a great cd.... but nice try Countess."
1,A trite examination of alternative lifestyles,"As most fans of hockey and SoSH know, Jeff Jacobs always brings a different perspective to all of his writing endeavors. This tome, one detailing his personal decent into the unsavoury world of male prostition and child slavery, is no different.Whether he is writing about his affinity for scatological videos or his consuming envy of minority interns, he just cannot escape the fact the while he may be an equal on the vitriolic scale, he just doesn't have the ability to equal the book sales of CHB.Some, like Lanternjaw, say that the Courant is a vile rag, but while I normally would throw it out, when a Jacobs column is featured, I find it imminently useful for lining my cat's litter box.As Jacobs is quoted on the dust cover of this book, ""If I can't match CHB or Buckley, I'll remain in Hartford and expose myself in elementary school yards."""
4,Vacation?,"I cannot believe what Max puts Lora through. The vacation from hell! But I loved it, keeps you reading on and on. Thanks again Karen."
2,"...yes, but it's boring!","The nice things that others have said about this book are all true. The characters are real and well fleshed-out. The things they do are understandable. The atmosphere is very evocative, and the messages about personal connection and war are important. The problem with the book is that basically nothing happens. The characters just basically hang around thinking about things like their relationships with each other and their deepest thoughts, and sometimes talk to each other about those things. But they never DO anything. So if you like that kind of thing, then this may be the book for you. But I can't recommend it to those of us who like a little plot with our stories."
3,"nice book, but about 20% of vocabulary unexplained","Like many in the teach-yourself series, this book is well thought out, presents a lot of manterial, and incudes 2 CDs. But like others in the series, it leaves many words unexplained. This happens not only inside the text, but also in the glossaries at the end.The CD dialogs try to make people speak, which is a pretty good idea. But while getting students to repeat 3-4 times various texts, the authors leave very important works inside exercises and leave it up to students to figure out pronunciation and meanings.Only buy this book if you have an Indonesian-Malaysian dictionary and if you have access to someone who can help you pronounce the words and put the accents in the right place."
3,Catholic approval?,"I'm not sure how this can be called a ""Catholic"" Bible when there is NO ""Imprimatur"" or ""Nihil Obstat""."
4,so nice...,"This is a very nice collection. If you're a huge Mel Torme fan, this might be a 5 star rating. Like the other ""Spotlight On..."" CDs, these are very polished studio recordings offering a wide range of the artist's talents, but I particularly enjoy hearing his voice with the big band sound on this CD."
5,"Melrose Place season 6, V.1","Received as described. Completes my set for this series. Haven't viewed the discs yet, but packaging looks to be in good shape."
2,Virtuosity but lack of musical sense,"Yes, these performances show that Pogorelich can do anything he wants on the keyboard -- but often at the expense of rather than towards the illumination of Chopin. He is a brilliant, wayward artist who seems to be trying to leave his mark on these often-played works; my ears hear distortion more than helpful innovation or clarity. Pogorelich has done much better work than this."
3,Familiar game to many others based on same theme,"Not bad, but for only a few bucks more, get ""Bejeweled 2 Deluxe"", by Pop Com and have the BEST game based on a very similar theme, for which I gave the latter 5 stars (and please see my review)."
5,one of the best for adults & children,"very well done with children and adults performers, all will love it. the children are wonderfull especially the mischievious boy mice. I have seen many versions, but this one is a favorite."
1,Not recommended....,"There are errors in this book.Not enough - indeed any - attention is paid to important parts of the CCNA exam, particularly router configuration, WAN configuration, NAT etc, which feature a heavily in the exam itself.It may be OK if you are doing INTRO (821), rather than ICND (811) or the CCNA itself (801), however the book does claim to be for all three.If you get it ""for free"" from Safari, it may be worth reading as a primer. Some ""real"" books however are recommended instead."
1,Dont depend on this book.,"This book is strong on theory and enumerating the specifics of the OSI model. It functions well as a dictionary and thesaurus for the exam. However, it falls flat in that it covers virtually nothing in regards to routing configurations - which make up the critical portion of the exam. Cisco makes ROUTERS after all - routing is amost half of it.If you want to pass the CCNA:1. Get practical experience doing routing and ISP work with Cisco routers. If you can't get that, buy lab time and get the experience there. If you cant buy lab time, get simulation software. NetSim or the venerable RouterSim would be a good start. There is no substitute for practical experience, but extensive lab work might come close.2. Get another book for the CCNA because this one wont get you anywhere. The official Cisco press books are much better, or theones from McGraw-Hill. But for god's sake, dont bet the farm on this one."
3,Great for kids - not for parents!,"My 5 year old daughter loves to receive her magazine. However, it is loaded with ads for dolls and other Disney items. The stories are great and she loves to look at the pictures sent in by other readers. But, because there is so much advertising- I really don't feel that it is worth the price. I will be looking for a different magazine once my subscription has run out."
3,Power to Create,Caroline Myss is direct and too the point. No muss. No Fuss.Starts off a bit slow and a little harsh but she brings it back around.
2,A little harsh,"I own many Caroline Myss CD's and I love them. I enjoy listening to her no-nonsense lessons on the importance of developing an ""interior life"" that respects the power and wonder of the Divine. However, she seems angry on this CD. Her no-nonsense manner suddenly becomes harsh and somewhat demeaning and the overall message is redundant. I ""get"" what she is saying and I appreciate the importance of aligning yourself with what is deep and meaningful in the Universe and not investing all of your time in gimmicks to bring you lots of ""stuff."" I understood this early on in the CD and did not need her to beat me over the head with it in a condescending, negative way. She also brags about all of her amazing medical intuitive skill and her self-discipline that makes her like a ""warrior."" It gets annoying and is difficult to listen to. I threw the CD out partway into the second one. I recommend ""Sacred Contracts"" and the one about intuition but not this one."
1,great message gets lost in the anger and insult,"She almost touches on a wonderful topic of moving beyond egocentric manifestation to allowing the wonder of the Universe to carry us. But it is hard to sit though her mocking sales clerks, insulting people who seek her guidance, talking about how greedy and petty humanity is etc. I wanted to put my arm around her and say, ""honey, why so angry? Take a deep breath, it'll be okay."" The message she almost touches on is explored by Ernest Holmes, Emma Curtis Hopkins and Troward if you are interested. The reason I gave it one star was because she really slams people who light candles and use oils repeatedly calling them idiots yet she sells ""sacred"" candles, ""sacred stone necklaces"" and oil sets for hundreds of dollars on her website. That my friend is low."
2,"historical yes, fantasy yes, romance NO","The plot fell flat for me. There was no spark or chemistry between Edward or Robyn at all. No build up of their romance or attraction for each other. They just loved each other at first sight? Not believable.Collin was not likable at all. Jo barely, Joy less so. Deirdre was fun but underdeveloped as a character. The reader never knows whether to like or distrust these characters, it was frustrating. I didn't feel I knew anyone, even Robyn very well. They were all paper cut-outs or comic strip charactersAgain, the premise gets 4 stars, but the story itself was weak and the love story even weaker. I didn't sense any of Gabaldon's famous passion between this author's hero & heroine."
2,Boston Liberal,"This show is the left's equivalent of a Jerry Falwell sermon, but funnier. When it isn't bludgeoning the viewer with mindless political dogma, it is amusing and entertaining. I sincerely hope the writers succeed in saving the world: As art, the show has been pretty much ruined."
5,Best from Boston,"This series has some of the best writing on TV. It's intelligent, funny, moving, and exciting, sometimes all at the same time. Definitely great TV."
1,Ruined a great show!!,"This spinoff was the ruination of ""The Practice,"" one of the best legal dramas ever aired. This ridiculously unrealistic sham is a major disappointment."
2,Black Oak Yngwie,"There are moments here in which Yngwie Johann Malmsteen plays so fast that the strings don't have time to resonate. His guitar sounds like a washboard.While I admire his skill, I think his vision falls a little short and doesn't do the washboard justice.A true washboard player can keep going for hours and hours. Getting those clothes clean, as anybody who's been in rehab knows, is spiritual training. Wherever they're from, the great washboard players have mountain eyes.One-handed stroking, a cello player or two, Tokyo, and in-law problems might be the beginnings of wisdom, but not if pride--""showing off,"" as Ritchie Blackmore said of Yngwie--keeps rearing its head.A sense of humor wouldn't hurt. Or a pilgrimage to the hills of Caroline.Given the many rock-band-with-symphony-orchestra pairings of late, it's about time that Jim Dandy Mangrum took what remains of Black Oak Arkansas and showed young Yngwie how to do it right.From idiot to savant is sometimes only a motion away."
1,Dissapointed,"All I ever wanted was for Yngwie to shut up and play; I chomped at the bit for two years before I got this album as a gift. Unfortunately, the instrumentals on his metal albums which I so enjoy apparently exhausted his supply of good material, because not even the reworks of previous stuff on this album are worth listening to. I'd like to send him the cd and ask for my money back. Back to Trilogy I go..."
3,Interesting but oddly passionless,"The book was interesting and informative about the author's involvement in the neo-nazi movement, but there was a certain spark missing from the work. Unlike ""The Autobiography of Malcom X"", for example, which also deals with an individual leaving and extremist group, Hasselbach never makes us *feel* why he ever belonged to such a group to begin with. It is written in a journalistic style, rather than personal one and I never felt like Hasselbach was truly letting his guard down. Still, it has some scary moments and it does give some insight into the life of a very frightening group of people."
5,kaleidoscope of keyboard themes,"balancing act is the correct title because john jarvis mixes up a lot of styles in this keyboard masterpiece.jazz,new age & easy listening instrumentals + 2 vocal performances keep you wondering where the next track will take you. ""rpm"""
4,Hillbilly Shoes-Boot Scootin' awesome!,"I have only heard the CD single that contains Hillbilly shoes, but I can not wait to get the rest of the CD. This is John Michael Montgomery's little brother, and it is obvious that talent runs in this family!"
5,Tattoos and Scars best country album in quite some time,"I probably should have written this review a long time ago, This album is GREAT, if you love kick you in the ...** country then this is the album to get, no filler tunes here. You get what you pay for. More albums should be like this. Brings back the feel of the 70's outlaws ""Waylon, Johnny, Willie, and Kris"" among others. Want good music then pick this up....NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"NOT FOR ANY TASTE, BUT VERY GOOD","Spacey acts brilliantly as always. Amazing. The dialogues are clever and important. But one cannot leave behind the plain fact that sometimes the story may get a little bit boring, because there isn't exactly a history, juss the perception of a history. Anyway, the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat watching the dialogues between Spacey and De Vito ( and the new boy )."
1,WHY?,"What is the point of creating something so boring? I couldn't make it through to the end, got about an hour into it & then decided that no possible ending could justify the previous pathetic hour so I stopped watching. What really amazing me is that people make a lot of money creating this lame crap."
1,5 minutes of action in 2 hours of nothing,"I am a big fan of the theatre. I like going to plays and I have been to many. However, in movie I expect more. 2 hours of mediocre acting by Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito doesnt cut it. I would only recommend this movie to people with severe heart conditions. In fact, even this would be to dull for them. This movie was a complete waste of time. Demand better from Hollywood, people! Thank you."
5,The Big Kahuna,"This is a movie about life as a salesman. Although it is only 90 minutes long this move covers life itself, and it is super. Any college grad should watch this movie two or three time from each characters perspective, you will get alot out of this film.This movie will some be gone from view, it was too short and to focused on one subject but it sure did that subject justice.Let's do some buzzziness!!"
2,"ho-hum, another serial killer","John Lutz has wom the Edgar and Shamus awards, so I'm assuming he's written much better stuff than this, a routine tale of a serial killer who burns people alive. The interplay between the investigating officers was not realistic at all, and the parade of suspects muddies the waters to no good effect. The officers also seemed to have a surprising lack of insight into the workings of the criminal mind, an unforgiveable sin in these days of psychological profiling. The serial killer is a sympathetic character, but we get little insight into his background and motivations."
3,"Adequate, but not what Revere used to be.","My parents had Revereware when I was growing up. The pots and pans were very high quality and designed to last a lifetime. The ones I just bought will do the job, but they are nowhere near the quality I remember. They are well made, but thin, and they will probably last me 10 years, except for the non-stick fry pan. That will be worn out in a year or two."
3,Revere Copper Clad Bottom pans,"I agree with some other reviews, the quality of the pans has decreased tremendously from the other Revereware copper bottom pans that I have from years ago. The stainless steel is lighter and the copper bottom does not seem to have a good quality to it. The copper bottoms has a rougher finish than in the older pans from Revere. They work fine and seem to heat fine, but the copper portion just isn't up to the quality I expected. The older pans have a mirror copper finish to them not a rough one like these pans do. Amazon is great! Got the order right away and a few weeks later saw the price had dropped, Amazon refunded the difference right away. NO complaints against Amazon what so ever, Revere has just lost some of it quality that it is known for."
1,Don't buy the video either!,"Being a preschool teacher, I am a big fan of children's music. All of the music on this CD sounds exactly the same! Completely annoying! Save your money and don't buy the video either, it is worse!"
2,"Gratuitous gore, completely lacking suspense or scares","The jacket to this DVD has a quote from Tobe Hooper (director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) giving it his blessing. Why he does, I'll never know- because just about everything in this schlockfest has been done much better in other movies including Hooper's.There are really no scares and no buildup of suspense- the action and ending is almost a foregone conclusion. Along the way we're treated to various dismemberments and murders which lack any atmosphere to really hold our attention.There are a few moments of amusing comedy, including a parade of some funny t-shirts worn by various players and a rather strange clown who owns the shop where the journey begins and who may or may not be directly connected to the main band of fruitloops who inhabit the house of the title- watch and see.Overall however there are far better (or worse, depending on your leanings) B-movies to expend your time on."
1,horrible,"only one word to describe this movie-horrible. I wish i could have rated it lower than 1 star. Don't waste your time or money. Rob Zombie needs to stick to music, not movies."
1,Sick and twisted & stupid.,"I usually stick it out through bad movies, but this one I walked out on. It's meant to gross out and offend so every other word is the ... word. It was too much when he described performing ...with his mother. I can only describe this movie as twisted.. but not a ""good"" twisted. If you could rate a movie with zero stars that's what I would rate this one."
1,This One Is A Dud,"I consider myself a bonafide horror movie buff. This, I must say, is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.The script made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Rob Zombie must have been zoned out on acid when he wrote this junk. There was absolutely nothing scary about this movie. It had a little blood and gore but none of it was scary or entertaining.Don't waste your money or time on this one, folks. It's a huge disappointment."
1,rob zombie is a freak,"ok sooo i bought this movie and just sold it to blockbuster in less than 5 hours of owning it, me n my gf and her brother watched this and could not believe how stupid/wierd/most of all disturbing this movie was, i LOVE horror movie, im right along with that other guy who gave this 2 stars. But if u really think about, this movie is kinda like sum stoner movie, like, u gotta be high to understand it (think about all this flash scenes every 5 minutes that are so colorful and wierd)so i mean, i dont smoke, so maybe thats why i dont like it. This film was just way to out there for me, and way to creepy, creepy in a bad way, i like being scared and seein gore, but, cmon at least make it have a understanding plot/storyline, not just for the fact of crazyness, cuz that doesnt make a good film at all. Overall, this is Lowbudget stoner [...].and PS, rob zombie, ur new cd [...]."
1,House of 1000 Corpses,"After much anticipation, I finally got to see this movie (although I did have to drive a distance for viewing). What a mess. Since I am quite aware that Rob Zombie has been struggling for over two years to get this movie by the ratings board, I can see that the finished product is a ""chopped-to-pieces"" mess. I suppose Mr. Zombie got tired a fighting the censors and caved in to their demands. And that's truly a pity. The movie had limitless possibilities, but it never really carried through on any of them.So, if you want to see schlock for schlock's sake, this might be your cup of tea. I rated low, but I am anticipating the DVD's release because I'm sure there will be more footage restored to this movie."
1,"Long, drawn-out, and boring","What a waste of film. I didn't expect much and I was disappointed. The movie was so long and the whole time I was stuck waiting for a reason that the production company paid money to put this on dvd... still wondering. The only highlights were Baby being SO fine and Captain Spaulding having a great personality (he was only in about five minutes of the movie though). Finally, I came to the conclusion that Rob Zombie made this film as a joke so that when people saw it and said that he had no business in Hollywood, he could surprise them with a better film on his next try... then I saw the Devil's Rejects and I'm just left scratching my head. What were any of these people thinking?"
4,Ummm.....where's this gore ive been hearing about????,First off I have to say that this is a very good movie. Too many people are trying to classify it as your generic horror movie...and that is very far from what this movie actually is. I watched it the first time and just couldnt understand what was going on at all so I watched again and well it didnt really help any. The main thing that let me down is the fact that so many people built this up to be a really gorey and disgusting movie....but this is obviously coming from people who dont take the time to watch a good horror film. I mean watch jason X and tell me that doesnt have way more blood and guts not to mention bodies than this movie does. So dont expect to be to grossed out and enjoy zombie's sick and twisted mind put to film.
3,Watch it because it is a ROB ZOMBIE movie!!!,"This movie was not that bad, considering how bad the censors were on him to make it a -non- gorey flick. Rob was determined to release it in the theaters, which i think was a stupid idea. He hardly made any money on it and did'nt do what he set out to do (scare and shock us with true horror). I say if he had just released it straight to video, he probably could've put anything his gruesome heart desired onto it. But no, he put it in on the big screen and turned alot of anxious viewers away, while scaring others of the cheesy acting.Don't get me wrong now, it was very different from any other teen sex running through woods away from big knives and burnt faces. But it really disappointed me, waiting a long time for it to come out and lets just say for me and alot of others not what I expected. I expected GORE!Please, Please Rob Zombie come out with a Director's Cut! Until then i will keep the movie on the rental shelf."
1,Beyond Stupid,"there are really no words that can describe this movie. It goes beyond all stupidity that you could ever possibly dream up. Karen Black actually stars in this movie and all I can say to her is a total ""shame on you"". If this is where horror is going now days then Hollywood has become a true disgrace to the art of film making."
3,It's quite good except...,"The First time I saw this movie was on netflix. I didnt really know what to expect since it was directed and written by Rob Zombie, who seems to like like adding alot of pointless nuditiy to his films. I dont mind how violent a movie is so long as its not littered with stupid sex scenes, might as well be watching soft-core porn. But I was truley suprised that there really is not that much nudity, the movie is interesting and has interesting characters, but I couldn't held continuosly thinking throughout the movie...that kinda reminds me of the Texas Chainsaw Masscre...and towards the end of the movie it became somewhat supernatural rather than just human killers, which I found somewhat strange, other than the similarity to TCM and the strange plot twist at the end I can say that I enjoyed this movie and would like to own it."
3,WHERE IS THE UN-RATED VERSION?,"This is one of the better horror films to come out in years. Now a days all we get is PG-13 horror films for a bigger market share. It has been 6 years since the original release and the studio has still not released an UN-RATED, DIRECTOR'S CUT of this masterpiece to 70's horror exploitation films. Why? Can someone answer this. In a Rob Zombie interview he stated the final version of this film is 109 minutes running time. It has been edited by 20 minutes !! Hopefully someone will wake up and finally release the UNCUT VERSION following the success of Zombie's UNCUT VERSION of HALLOWEEN on DVD."
5,One of the best horror films in a very long time,"How can you not love this movie? We have a horror movie made by a true fanatic of horror movies. Zombie didn't want to make one of those horror movies of recent years which you forget about, he wanted to make a horror classic, and he did. He shows his love for the horror genre by going back to the basics like horror movies used to do. All the camera angles, characters, storyline, scenery, and music all mixed together to make an amazing movie. If you are the right kind of fan-this movie, especially particular scenes, will remain tattooed into your mind days after seeing this film. Zombie did a masterful job with this and I can't wait for the sequel."
1,Movie of 1000 Minutes,"Read my review and learn, Rob Zombie:A good guitar riff can get you a 3-minute song, but for a feature length movie you need a good story.More is less."
1,I DID NOT like this movie.,"A friend of mine recommened this to me, and we watched it earlier today. I hated this movie. The acting was bad, the plot was barely there, and the writing was HORRIBLE. I understand that this was a throwback to old horror movies from the seventies, but if you're gonna do it, do it right. It had one or two funny and/or disturbing scenes in it, but for the most part, it sucked. I didn't like the use of satanic rituals in this movie. It really bothered me, and I know that the scene was probably meant to do that, but still. If you're the kind of person who is sensitive to that type of material, then stay away from this film. I have my reasons for feeling the way that I do about that.This could have been a fun movie, and I was a bit disappointed. I wasn't expecting much in the first place, but I wanted it to be amusing at best. Like I said, there were a few good moments in it, but not enough to waste an hour and fifteen minutes of your life on.SKIP IT."
5,A good dvd and movie!!!,"I liked this movie, it was good. I liked all the actors.I liked sheri moon. the grandpa was funny. The dvd has good features."
5,when does this movie come to dvd???,I have been searching and searchhing. my bro left for the navy and is getting on leave sometime and we'd love to buy it but we have no clue when it comes out? plz let me knowthnx so much
1,Trash.,"One word can describe this movie. Trash. My parents wasted their money renting this movie for me. This movie had to have had the worst plot i've ever seen. Take it from me, don't waste your money with this movie. Its trash."
2,Title says all,"Two ill-fated couples travelling across the American country side stop at the off-beat Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen and learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. This ultimately leads them to become prisoners at a house full of murderous crazies. Directed by death-metal rocker Rob Zombie, he shows an obvious soft spot for horror films with his consistant homages to genre classics (most noteably THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), but there isn't a scare to be found, only a showcase of typically expected gore and a flavour of twisted black humour. Most of the fun is saved for the end climax, by then things get really sick! Zombie's insertion of old-fashion film clips quickly becomes monotonous."
3,Utterly Disturbing,"I had been hearing and reading about this movie since I first learned about back in 2000. I was actually interested in seeing it. One of my friends reccomended that I don't. He said it will ""'f' with your head."" I should have listened. The violence was very graphic, particularly when Baby (played by Mr. Zombie's real-life girlfriend Sheri Moon) procedes to scalp one of the male characters. For a directorial debut, I must applaud Mr. Zombie for this effort. It couldn't have been done better if Tobe Hopper did it. As for actual movie quality, there is no plot the acting is just plain B-A-D and the film itself holds no redeeming purpose. For those of you still plan to see it based on the Zombie name alone, be forewarned: don't expect their to be a happy ending a la the original ""Texas Chainsa Massacre."""
2,"Oh please, this is not a 4 or 5 star movie AT ALL!!!","Give me a break. The only part of this movie that was interesting was the last 20 minutes when you get to see the catacombs. The first hour or more is boring and stupid. It is Rob Zombie's style to mix hillbillies, carnie folk, and some disturbing aspects. The only ""cult"" thing about it is that Rob Zombie did it. If anyone else were to have done it...you probably would not have seen it at the theater...it would have gone straight to video like many other B, C, D or F horror movies. Worth renting just to see it and say, ""ya I saw it, big deal,"" but definetly not one to have amongst your DVD collection...unless you picked it up at Blockbuster for $1.50, even then."
1,Some Help,"I am a HUGE horror film fan! My favorite movie is Night Of The Living Dead. I am interested in seeing this movie but I would like to know from others who have seen it if it is better than NOTLD, worse, or about the same?? I am not a Rob Zombie fan but am a ""zombie"" fan! In MY opinion, George Romero rocks!!"
3,"Entertaining, but not scary","For a horror movie, this ain't scary, which IS a problem. Luckily, it isn't too big of one. It's really very funny, which was surprising, and the campiness made it better. I dig the sideburns on the rednecks. If only I could grow some like those..."
5,WAY BETTER THAN U THINK!,"THIS MOVIE IS CRAZY AND ITS A MUST SEE FOR HORROR FANS. ITS LIKE AN ACID TRIP(MEANING THATS THERE IS SO MANY VISIUAL THINGS GOING ON). ITS BLOODY AND GOREY,NOT REALLY SCARY BUT MORE FUNNY IN A REALLY SICK WAY. THE GRANDPA IS AWSOME AND HIS JOKES ARE FUNNY, AND FISH BOY IS HILARIOUS.ITS A REALLY SICK RIDE AND THE CRAZY DR. SATAN WHO IS MORE OR LESS MY VISION OF THE ""ANGEL OF DEATH"" IS A REAL COOL HORROR CHARACTER.BASICALLY its a blood bath with a shoom topping and ROB has a sick mind but i love it"
3,Nice presentation but lacked dread factor.,"Wednesday, April 14, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Nice presentation but lacked dread factor. I had recently picked up Rob Zombie's greatest hits the other day after becoming aware of him with the Living Dead Girl era. When I saw his name attached to this film I was intrigued to see how he'd handle a 70's gore-fest homage after seeing a bunch of his videos on the greatest hits cd/dvd. While never causing any feelings of fear or dread that accompanied my initial viewings of Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in the day, this film was pretty artsy schlock. That is to say it was Corman level in its camp but executed with higher production values. Heh. It never aspires beyond its station and has fun w/ its cartoony gore. Two couples are attacked and locked up in a house of horrors with a freaker family. Yes, it's an overused contrived plot at this point in horror cinema history, but it was an amusing hour and half."
1,Rob Zombie Directing A Film?,"Alright, I had high hopes for this one. I really did. I'm not really a fan of Rob...But the movie preview looked cool, and in reality though this movie was crap. When I was in the theatre watching it I noticed right away, that I had already seen it, back when it was called Texas Chainsaw Massacre! This movie is nothing more than a lame copy of TCM, except for new actors. Thats it. Come on Rob, what were you thinking man?"
1,Retched Vile,"This movie is popular for one reason-Rob Zombie directed it! That's it! It's not frightening, disturbing, humurous, or slightly entertaining. It's like a cross between Texas Chainsaw massacre and The People Under the Stairs. Rubbish!"
4,"What a great, effed up movie!","My favorite part of the DVD is Sid Haig's ranting if you stay on the main menu too long. He is hilarious! Of course, those with more refined senses of humor will probably find him repugnant, but nonetheless I feel he ""makes"" this DVD. The movie itself I loved, because I love all ""gore"" horror movies (i.e. Texas Chainsaw, Friday 13th, etc) so if you do too, get this movie! Plus, the soundtrack is excellent. This is worth buying just to watch that one night when nobody's home, it's dark and scary, and a bunch of psychopath neighbors just moved in next door!"
4,Rob Zombie - I thought it was just a gimmick,"Rob Zombie of the former heavy metal group White Zombie has made a living off of horror. He injected his music with it many years ago, and rode the wave to fortune, and fame. I always thought it was just a gimmick, until I saw this movie. It flashes in and out from scene to scene with more camera effects than a kaleidoscope. With cheesy hicks setting the stage for a blood bath, you'll soon realise what I did. Rob Zombie is a schizophrenic. I think he really sees all of this jacked up stuff in his head. Is it too many years of drug abuse? You make the call. After watching this film though, I felt paranoid, depressed, and every other emotion in the book. If you want to have a very bad trip without taking any drugs, watch this movie. Some of the images will haunt you for quite awhile."
1,Terrible.,"Although all of Rob Zombie's musical ventures are on the lines of absolute crap since he obviously cares more about his image than anything else, I decided I'd one day go with my girlfriend to the movie theater and see if it lives up to the hype of ""most gorey movie ever"". Man, what a waste of $7!!!The movie had absolutely no relevant plot, the ""horror"" scenes were in the vein of the typically corny slasher movies of the 70's and mid-80's at best, and the fact that there was a somewhat cartoonish vibe to all the violence only made the movie all the more cheesy to tolerate, oops, I meant watch. I'm not lying when I say that half the people seeing that movie got up and left half way through its running time, so I guess this was one of those wierd times where everybody's right about Rob Zombie being completely inept at writing music as well as directing films. Do NOT see this movie unless you want to waste both your time and your hard earned money."
4,Campy Splatterfest never better,"Not since Texas Chainsaw 2 has there been a better Cult Horror flick. Rob Zombie has rejuvinated the horror industry with this new cult classic. The unique characters and sweet catch phrases will have you rootin for the bad guys in no time. This is how horror flicks should be done. I can't wait to see The Devil's Rejects, his second film."
2,dissapointing to say the least,I couldn't wait to watch this film......then I did.I could have sworn I saw a similar movie to this one before.It was much better and it was called Texas Chainsaw Masacre.
1,House Of 1000 Re+@rds,"What the HELL was this??? Atrocious directing by Rob ""the hack"" Zombie (who seems to think this is a 2-hour music video based on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). A brainless script that is neither smart nor fresh. An amazingly moronic plot that's neither entertaining nor clever... Rob's first effort in the way of directing failed miserably. Not at ALL what I expected. You'd think such an inane piece of drivel would at least satisfy gore-hounds on account of there's nothing in the way of a refreshing plot. Ho1000C is about as gory as A Charlie Brown Christmas. Terrible, HORRIBLE movie. No wonder so many studios dropped this piece of 5h!+"
5,Superb Horror Film,"I really don't understand any of the negative reviews. Perhaps these reviewers should not be watching horror films, judging by some of the comments. This was a truly frightening film and Rob Zombie is to be lauded in his first time effort. He seems like an old pro at it. I look forward to many more thrills from him in the future."
2,Mediocre rubbish....,"I generally enjoy films that are deliberately trashy and schlocky, however this film was truly amatuerish and just plain pathetic. The film lacked any real atmosphere and tension, and so I found myself looking at my watch for the entire proceedings."
4,A Grisly Homage,"I give this film 4 stars only because I have difficulty giving 5 to a film that isn't completely original. There are a few instances during the movie where Rob Zombie lifts directly from other horror movies (Texas Chainsaw, Hills Have Eyes, etc.). Given the type of movie it is, though, that isn't really a bad thing. Horror movies have been cannibalizing each other for decades (pun intended), and what Rob has done is take only the most successful parts and stitch them into a very well-paced and smartly edited gore-fest.The cast is one of the most well-assembled I've seen in a horror flick in some time. Karen Black is STILL hot. Bill Moseley is as creepy as ever. Sid Haig provides some of the best lines in the movie. And Sheri Moon... well, Sheri Moon is just plain too sweet & too evil.Pop this in the DVD player on a dark & stormy night and soon you'll be curled up in the fetal position, rocking back & forth, muttering ""Bury me in a nameless grave..."""
3,House of 1000 Corpses???,"I heard a lot about the movie being gore and violent.However, It was a disappointment in the storyline and didnt quite get the story at the end.The dvd release of the movie is really good with its interactive menu and lots of extras.Its a good buy if you lower your expectations for the movie.Overall,it is entertaining at certain parts and due to its clarity and great sound,it kept me going.If you are looking for something out of the ordinary,then its worth a buy.Minus the storyline, the rest is good."
4,Sheri is hot!,"Sheri Moon is smokin' hot in this ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""-ish flick. She steals the show and should be showcased in any future flicks by Rob or others. MORE SHERI!!! PLEASE!!!Best sound bite by Sheri...""We like to get f*%'d up and do f*%'d up things, if you know what I mean!"""
1,Zombie made a mess and it cant be fixed,"being a Rob Zombie music fan I watched this movie. by god it stunk, im sorry but it did and you all who liked it can kiss my ass. nothing was good about this movie. the horrible dialouge and gruesome characters only make this a bore beyond the bore margain. a waste of time for me. if you want horror rent something other than this one. one of the worst movies of 2003"
2,Humor-value earns the 2 stars,"While this movie doesn't exactly revolutionize the horror genre, it does persevere through horrid moments by use of humor. Unfortunately, this humor is really childish in some places.If you're in to campy horror, give it a shot. But even then, don't expect too much."
5,Great horror movie!,"I love ""B"" horror movies. In my opinion, I've watched quite a few great ones. However, ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" is one of the best horror movies that I've ever seen. I haven't seen too many that are better.I don't want to give away all of the details about the movie, because I don't want to ruin the film for anyone that hasn't seen it. Let me just say that I thought all of the actors' and actresses' performances were very powerful. On top of that, I thought that the writing was brilliant.Like I said, I would love to give away more details about the movie here, but I just don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the older horror movies that were made in the 1970s and 1980s."
1,Stick to your rock and roll Zombie...,"This movie annoyed me, I couldn't follow it. I mean, I got the whole story but there was a story being told only to be interrupted every 5 minutes by Zombie showing off that he knows how to use a Super 8 camera and add effects to it. Woooo!! Scary!!I think Zombie should stick to rock music especially if he thinks it's worth it to produce and direct a 120+ minute rock video."
1,not a classic,"This is one of the worst horror films ever made. This movie is a sloppy mess about a deranged low life killer family that wreak havoc on travelers. This movie could have been entertaining instead it was dull, very poorly written, and had a very poor plot and almost no special effects."
4,how would anyone know yet?,have you seen it as far as i can see the movie dosn't open till october 18th it looks and sounds very interesting unlike the slasher crap that is floating about these days i know i'll be in line to see and zombie's music simplistic yet highly enjoyablei know i am a musician myself it's not the techniqality he puts in to his music that makes in great but the love of what he does
4,Not as good as I hoped,"I love Rob Zombie's music. So when I first heard about this movie and how he was having problems getting it to theaters, I figured this must be one gruesome and disturbing movie. I really did enjoy it. My girlfriend thought it was morbid and disturbing. But, I thought it was a little tamed to what I had expected. Infact I don't understand why it was so hard for him to get it to the thearter. But, I did enjoy it. And for those of you who enjoy a good ole bloody movie should give it a watch."
3,a visit to St. James,"Although this book goes on a bit too long, the finely wrought detail about life in the middle ages makes the read worthwhile. As a murder mystery, Strong as Death is fairly easy to decipher. But as other Amazon reviewers have explained so well, Sharan Newman's forte lies in her ability to convey the atmosphere and ambience of everyday life in the 12th century. Her characterization of myriad individuals, nationalities, religions, professions, and relationships is sensitive and credible. Her treatment of the ever present conflict between Jews, Christians, and Muslims appears fair and balanced. Newman's prose style is flowing and enables the reader to become immersed right from the start. Well-worth a look."
5,A riot,"Very funny although the author probably didn't intend it that way, the recent addition of VERY funny pictures by the new editor just adds to the joy of."
3,Okay for the low cost,"These were the cheapest screen inserts I could find, and I got what I paid for. They're pretty flimsy, and I do kind of feel like I have to be mindful of not using too much force when adjusting them for the sake of not breaking. I ordered four units. They were all thrown into an ill-sized box, with a lot of empty volume for the screens to rattle around. As such, one arrived with the metal central support bent, and a second had a wooden edge section that was snapped. Despite all that, they work. Once in place within their respective windows, they stay put. So, no regrets I suppose..."
2,"reference material book yes, exam aid, no",This book will get you some basic knowledge of what you need to pass the XP exam. I would use it more for reference than a study guide. I would not suggest using it alone to pass the exam. Get yourself some other more detailed books or study aids.
2,picture of hat looks different then product.,"When I got this hat it looked different then the picture on Amazon.the color was more fadded and the ""S"" was bigger and made it look childish.the fit was off also. I like my hats to fit around my head, not sit on top of it."
4,"Good, Not Great","This season is not as good as some of the earlier seasons, but still very enjoyable overall. I'm still a Project Runway fan!"
4,Book Review: 12 Greeks & Romans,"Great book if you like history, antiquity - Greek & Roman culture, etc.It's a fast reader, full of historic facts. This is a good book for anyone interested in ancient history and how these 10 men really canged the world they lived in - cosequently shaping the world we live in (I say 10 because I don't care much for the last two...). Overall, a great book: it keeps you interested, it's not dry; every chapter gives the reader a chance to delve into a specific period in history - the times of Homer, Themestocles, Alexander, Caesar, Cicero, so on. Highly recommend it."
5,The Beatles Fiction/Non-fiction collection is complete,"Wonderful, epic book on the Fab Four. Great photos bring John, Paul, Ringo, George back to life. Combined with Alan Arlt's fictional masterpiece on the Beatles, THE CARPET FROGS, this book makes my Beatles collection complete."
5,I wish I could go higher than 5 stars!,"10 stars to say the least! First of all, I ordered this book through Amazon and received it VERY quickly - thanks Jeff Bezos!Getting back to the Beatles Anthology, what a job they have done and thanks to George Martin and the late-great Derek Taylor. This book is big and heavy because the Beatles were/are big and a heavy part of our culture. The story is finally told the right way and not to put anyone down like the late Nick Schaffner, Lewisohn, Hunter Davis or others who have written great books. If it weren't for them, we wouldn't know so much in the first place.But this book HAD to be happen. John, Paul, George & Ringo - thanks for everything! One little thing missing - I wanted to know more on the modern day, Anthology video, CD and book get togetherness. Who called who? How was it decided? And, yes, more from Yoko's modern day participation.Thanks for the Love and Music! Can't wait for Beatles One CD!"
5,Impressive,The coffee table size of this books makes it an impressive gift. I'm sure any Beatles fan would be pleased to own it.
4,A Necessary Companion to All Your Other Beatles Books,"If you are a Beatles fan who enjoys reading about them (and not just listening) then you have to own this book. It is the story of the Beatles from their own lips. Is it the definitive Beatles book? Well, the Beatles have a vested interest in preserving their legacy so are we getting the true picture? And Lennon's absence--he's represented as well as possible--slants the overall balance to McCartney. It has more detail than the video anthology which glosses over the break up and many other details. But the Anthology book should be read as one of several crucial Beatles books mentioned in many other reviews. My favorites are the Peter Brown book, Richard DiLello's ""The Longest Cocktail Party"" (as much about Apple as the Beatles but a hoot!) and Nicholas Schaffner's ""Beatles Forever"", still my favorite after all these years. The Anthology is not the only Beatles book to own."
3,Not what I expected.,"This is a somewhat disturbing book. It tends to glorify the Beatles, in a way that has not been done since the 1960's. I am not sure John would be a big fan for this reason. He distanced himself from this kind of thing years before his death. In fact, one might argue that this is the kind of thing that attracts people to the band. Overall though I did like it quite a bit and would recommend it to those who know little or nothing about the greatest rock band in the history of western civilization."
3,"We love them, Blah, Blah, Blah","Yes, I know- everyone just loves the Beatles. Yes, this big cumbersome book is comprised of quotations from the real four men themselves. But who wants to hear someone talk endlessly about how great they believe themselves to be? The Beach Boys were a great band, but there is a point where ""setting the record straight"" can slip into self-aggrandizing. There are lots of funny anecdotes in this book if you have the patience to find them. But this is ultimately more than anyone but a staunch completists needs about a rock band."
2,"High Production Value, Very Little Science","I saw this film in a college genetics class, and found it very disappointing! While the computer graphics are fabulous, and nearly everyone in the film is a biologist, the film is very weak. They make lots of persuasive claims, b ut have absolutely nothing, that's NOTHING to back any of it up. Anyone can suggest the presence of a designer, but as yet it is completely untestable, and CANNOT be passed off as science. This is a flimsy attempt to bring creationist theory into a scientific arena, and anyone who thinks that this film is based on science is not a critical thinker!!"
5,Will blow you mind,"Watch this video and your life will never be the same again, it is that powerfull. Trust me buy it, then invite friends and family to see it. Excelent computer animation on DNA section."
1,Bull...,"I suppose it really is one of the better disguised pseudoscience ""proofs"" one can purchase, but please don't waste your money,I would go for Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion instead, it will much better and accuratley inform you!"
1,This is the worst Spanish book I've ever seen!,"I had no prior experience with a foreign language and have been stuck with this book at my local community college for 3 semesters. It is extremely advanced and difficult to follow. After purchasing additional tapes, CD-ROM, verb conjugator and a Spanish/English dictionary, I am still unable to translate some sentences. This book goes beyond confusion, it is almost impossible to learn from. As a matter of fact, if you are not already fluent in the Spanish language, I wouldn't recommend this book at all! It is horrible! And definitely not for beginners!"
5,worth the price,This conditioner is really really good. It does what it states on the packaging. It's defentely a miracle. Wouldnt hesitate to purchase another one.
3,Too big.,"The pendant is very nice, but it is just too big for my taste. I returned it and got the one parent/one child small one. It is beautiful. I love it."
3,In-depth but Complex,"Speaking from a Layman's point of view, this is no easy read. The book is full of information and plenty of explanations about schemas and their application and origin. This book will likely require a 2nd if not a 3rd reading to fully understand it's concepts.As for me, I found if interesting enough to know what schemas are and how they interpret my life's experiences and viewpoints. This was already brought up in the 1st chapter. But having no desire to pursue a PHD, I quickly lost interest in reading the rest of the book because of the considerable details. The book read more like a 4 th year psychology textbook than a self-help book.Surely schemas are a very important and relevant method of clinical diagnosis, and I will be better off knowing more about them. I only wish the authors could make it less scientific. Perhaps a few more case studies would be helpful."
2,No magic in these dolphins,I am not sure who would enjoy this DVD. We didn't. It was just boring. I mean - how long can you watch fish swim?? I was hoping to show part of this to my students for a musical experience but I don't think they would enjoy it.And the photography is not always very clear
3,We should be ashamed,"The practice exams and instruction were good, but they should be ashamed for presenting a left-wing, anti-american, global warming slant to almost all of the lectures and reading material. Good way to start indoctrinating young people before they have a good grasp of English. Despite all of that, my students did well on the TOEFL exam."
3,No practice test.,The product was good and in perfect condition. The CD also works fine. But I won't suggest this book as the best study material for TOEFL. The official Guide to TOEFL from ETS which has some Practice tests in the CD is way better.http://www.amazon.com/Official-Guide-TOEFL-CD-ROM-Toefl/dp/0071766588/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1328497070&sr;=8-2
3,Not sacred!!!,"This is an OK cd by an OK counter-tenor, but where the title ""sacred arias"" comes from is beyond me. True, these are arias from oratorios rather than operas and therefore have a biblical basis, but ""sacred"" they are not. Many better interpretations elsewhere. Disappointing."
3,Making bigamy rather pedestrian,"Ida Lupino, best known as a pragmatic, sensible, appealing actress of the 30s - 50s, usually playing tough but kind-hearted, hard-luck characters--HIGH SIERRA, ON DANGEROUS GROUND--was also a producer and an independent filmmaker. She acted in and directed a lot of TV too, into the 1970s. The half-dozen films she directed were mostly dramas, often about ""controversial"" subjects. THE BIGAMIST takes a rather stolid Edmund O'Brien, married to a supremely self-confident and classy Joan Fontaine in San Francisco, and since O'Brien is a traveling salesman whose job takes him frequently to Los Angeles, one thing leads to another and he pairs up with with working-class Ida Lupino in LA. THE BIGAMIST sets out to try to understand this ordinary hero who ends up married to two women. Sounds fascinating, and the film has a star cast: why is it such a dull experience, then?"
4,Eric Jerome Dickey - Naughty or Nice,All of Dickey's books are fun to read. They really keep your interest all the way through them. I love the way he crosses some of the characters over into his other books.....just throws them in there even though it a stand alone story. I'm hooked and can't wait to read another one.
2,dont buy it,"i dont think i enjoyed one of his books yet..i don't recommend this one. His style of writing is just wrong, and confusing. i dont think i'm bying any more of his books"
2,It's Just OK,"It took me a long time to finish this one and when I finally did, I just had a ho-hum kinda feeling. The ending did catch me off guard, so I appreciated that aspect of the book, but it was just your typical relationship book, I guess. I like Dickey so this one didn't disappoint at all, but it didn't have that WOW factor."
2,Eric is getting lazy,"I havent read a Dickey book in so long and just when i decide to pick on up, I am disappointed again. I had to push myself to get through this one. He did not take time to develope the characters, instead focusing on their sexual escapades. There could have been a lot more story behind these women. Sadly, he just lost whatever he had in him to write his first couple of books. (Sigh)."
3,Good,"It took me soooooo long to finish this book. It was boring at times, and drug on to no point. I love Eric J. Dickey's writing, but this story really didnt seem to have a point. When I finished reading I was like ""and???"" I've read alot better."
1,Naughty or NIce,This book was horrible. Every thing that happened in this book he could of wrote in one chapter. After reading this I still don't know the story line. Don't by this book.
5,YOU GOTTA READ THIS BOOK!!!!,"EJD is my favortie author. I have read all of his books and they are all 5 stars. It amazes me how much he knows about women. The ending of this book is what completely flips you out... I was actually expecting it to end up the other way around (you have to read the book to know what I'm talking about)..... EJD has re-visited some of his past characters in his previous books, so you may want to start at the beginning and work you way up!!! ENJOY! {Your'e in for a treat)"
5,I Love Eric Jerome Dickey,This book kept you on your toes the entire time. I finished this book in one day and was mad that there was no more to the book to finish. I love the way that this author rights because it makes you feel as though you are there with him and the characters.
4,An edge-of-your-seat suspense novel!,"This was the first Barbara Wood book that I've ever read, and I found it very enjoyable. In fact, I liked it enough to be interested in reading some of her other novels. I found the book very intense in some scenes, and over all, very exciting. I couldn't put it down! The plot was very good and was written at a nice pace, not too fast, not to slow. I can't remember a truly boring part of this novel. Although I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, I thought that some of it was just too much, like the maze and Atlantis Island part. I found that Vegas scene totally stupid and silly, but still, I liked the book. I do recommend this book, but keep in mind, it is only entertainment. It isn't meant to change your faith."
1,Sammy's Disasters,"I am big on recycling, even turning old jeans into pillows & quilts. However, twice in my life I have thrown books in the trash instead of passing them on to others. This book is one that got dumped in the barrel (the other was a mean-spirited biography of Sinatra).I love a good self-deprecating protagonist, but good grief, Sammy needs meds, not readers. Do 26 year-olds really think this way? Are they that self-focused? Does early adolescence really stretch out that long these days? If so, it is a sorry state.Sorry, folks, I hate to carp, but I really tried to soldier on. I couldn't make it past the half-way mark in this book. I didn't learn anything (I already knew our country was run by ambition & immature staffers), & I wasn't even mildly amused.I bought this hardcover for $3.00, & sadly conclude I wasted both time & money. I've been sitting here trying to think of something positive to say, but no luck--"
2,amusing at first...,"I found the book fairly amusing at first, with some nice one-liners that i laughed at. But that quickly grew tiresome as all the quirky digressions,forced cleverness, and well-meaning but ham-fisted diatribes on healthcare, just became too much. Not to mention the book had a total lack of plot. I got to where her senator was holding meetings in Ohio, then gave up and moved on to a Lee Child thriller, because I needed plot so badly at that point.My girlfriend really liked the book, in fact her frequent laughing out loud while reading made me want to read it once she was done. But I just didn't like it."
5,VERY FUNNY - I truly enjoyed the book,I did not expect to really like this book. We are reading it in my book club so it just wasn't one I would have chosen. I am not all that interested in politics and most books that attempt to be funny are just stupid/silly in my eyes.I think at the beginning of the book I felt like Sammy's humor was too contrived (particulary the mismatched shoes) but I must say STICK WITH IT - it's so worth it. The character really grew on me. I was laughing out loud at certain points (very rare for me).What an awesome 1st book - I will definitely get the next one.
4,hypochrondia at its funniest,"Kristen Gore is the third generation Gore family writer. In this book, her fictional characters are hilarious yet oddly believable. This is a fun read, not to be taken seriously. Not for non-fiction only readers, except it might just loosen them up a little. The heroine's hypochrondia, especially since she is adviser to the fictional Senator on health care, is the too funny satire that shows why Kristin is a perfect writer for Saturday Night Live."
5,Excellent for what it is.,"This text is written as a non-technical (although by no means superficial) overview of some statistical methods. It is a joy to read, and gets at the heart of the matter on many topics I'd previously been unclear on. The book was recommended to me as a reference, and I'm glad I took the advice."
3,Nothing special.,"This set up quickly and it prints just fine for regular size paper. It does well scanning also. It prints pretty quickly. The toner does seem to last. However, beyond these points don't expect anything else. Labels shift. Envelopes are impossible to print. I have used this printer/copier/scanner since Jan 05. If you are looking for a basic printer copier. This works."
4,Truly great for the price,"Have had a Canon MF 3111 for close to three years and I love it. Yes the paper tray is just a bit flimsy. We are talking about a sub $200 printer here. Has a couple of its own unique limitations but this has been an amazingly reliable crisp and cheap printer for a long time. At the price we paid we expected a machine much less than this. Only have one complaint. We cannot get a driver for Windows 7 64 bit. Had to give our printer to one of our daughters because we cannot get it to run with our new computer. Devastation. If you are not running Win 7 64 bit this is a genuine deal.However, if anyone knows of a way to get it to work with Win 7, I would be in your debt because it just keeps on going."
2,I can't believe I paid for this!!,"Unfortunately I bought a package deal containing nearly all of her videos. She is stiff and I found myself watching her background dancers who portray by far better dancing abilities the she does. I was surprised as she has won awards yet the dancing I see is not the style of dance that I classify as belly dance, let alone what I know she is capable of. If she were to package it as aerobics and leave out the ""belly dancing"" it would be more accurate. Yes it will get you sweating and give you a nice little workout but there is little fluidity in her 'dance'. It is misleading to think you will actually learn anything from her....although the background dancers...hmmmm...watch them and you may find yourself at least learning a little. I'll stick to Delilah, Atea, and others whom know how to really dance as well as teach."
3,"A nice album for first time listeners, not the best for fans","This is an good collection of songs from an extremely talented soul artist. For first time listeners of Percy Sledge, this album will give a good overview of his music. For hardcore fans of his music however, this cd might be a slight disappointment. Several of the songs are not the original singles from the 60's, most notably ""It Tears Me Up"" and ""When A Man Loves A Woman."" I was most disappointed with ""When A Man Loves A Woman,"" not only because it was not the original recording, but also because frankly, the version of this song on this cd is horrible compared to the original. I guess by itself it still stands up to being to great song that it is, but people who know the original already will not be able to listen to this version. So in summary, if you are looking for Percy Sledge's original masterpiece of ""When A Man Loves A Woman,"" then don't buy this cd. If you don't know his music, then this is probably an pretty good cd."
1,Complete drivel...,"I was apprehensively awaiting the new release of studio material after 15 years. Apprehensive because I wasn't sure if we were going to get some more rehashed power ballads or something fresh and new. Unfortunately this is the same pap that dominated their late 80's and early 90's work. If anyone has heard the material from the never-released label-rejected ""Stone of Sisyphus"" (aka Chicago 22), you will know that this band is capable of exciting and fresh music. Those songs sound terrific even after 14 years. What a waste!"
3,This CD is alright.,"It sounded pretty much as I had read that it would. I like it because I love the group Chicago. However, it had only a few ""classic"" sounding songs. The horns sound beautiful."
2,Not one of their better efforts.....,".......I confess I'm more a fan of their earlier, more progressive material, but I did enjoy Chicago 16 quite alot. I tired quickly of the cookie-cutter pop they churned out afterwards. ""XXX"" is, unfortunately, much of the same, only not quite as good. It's not terrible, it's just miquetoast Chicago-lite. Can't wait to get my mitts on ""Stone of Sisyphus"" coming out via Rhino Records!! Now, THAT'S the Chicago I know and love!!"
5,AWESOME CD!!,THE BEST BABYS ALBUM - I WORE MY OLD ALBUM OUT YEARS AGO. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE OF US THAT WILL FOREVER LOVE THOSE 80'S BANDS!!
5,"Deeply Moving ""Lament and Prayer"" for WWII Victims","I like ""Lament and Prayer"" best in this CD. It is a very serious, beautiful piece, which is dedicated ""in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of WWII and Holocaust"". Pamela Frank, whom this piece was commissioned for, is playing as if praying. The Minnesota Orchestra, especially strings, lead by David Zinman responded very well. In the final minutes, her violin and the orchestra finish in a calm, timeless melody. I was so moved when I actually listened to this piece, played by Pamela Frank, in a concert hall. Air for Violin is also beautiful and serene, but it is a simpler piece. Double Concerto for Violin and Guitar is an interesting piece. The jazz-like first and third movements contrast with the second movement, partly dissonant but richly melodious. Violin and guitar is a very intriguing combination. This Pulitzer prize-winning CD contains masterpieces by Aaron Jay Kernis (b. 1960)."
3,Okay for a TV Version,"While this series does not capture the haunting feeling of dread that permeates the Dead Zone feature film, and Anthony Michael Hall is no Christopher Walken, it is nonetheless a good fluffy sci-fi watch. I enjoyed the whole series but one season does not stick out more than another. In fact, while an enjoyable ride, it's not a memorable series in total."
1,Insulting,"I am not a Native American, but I know a few. This show is an absolute joke and insult to Native Americans. I find it offensive. I have a great deal of respect for the Indian Nations, this country is theirs. I have two Navajo granddaughters, and I find this show repulsive. An attempt to capitalize on an ancient culture and put it in a pickle jar, is disgusting to put it mildly......"
4,Great Map,The Map of the city was very easy to follow and was accurate. The METROPOLITAN (subway) map was very valuable. Laminated map easy to write and mark wiht a pen and did not get managed even on a 10 day stay in Paris. :)
3,Streetwise Paris,"It was not as easy to read as I'd expected. Having to turn it over made it awkward. I found it not as good as a free paper map I picked up in Paris several years ago. However, the laminated surface is a plus."
5,Used it constantly to get around,"We recently returned from Paris, where we walked through many neighborhoods. We tried the cheap tourist maps. They fall apart and leave out the little streets. This map contained all the streets for the central areas along the Sienne River. Even though there was a great amount of detail, all the street names were easy to read. The lamination helped because scattered showers are common in Paris. I recommend this map for anyone who wishes to venture to the less beaten paths."
2,Don't understand why this map got such good reviews in the first place...,"I bought this laminated streetwise paris map, and I REALLY don't like it! The map chops the entire Paris area in half, and displays one half on one side, and the other half on the other side of the map --- you cannot view the entire paris area all at one time, which creates a problem when you try to see which road leads to where -- you're constantly flipping the map over and back and forth, and you still cannot see how the roads (or metro lines) line up on the other side).I really wish that the entire area was on one page (not double-sided)So what that's it's small, it's absolutely useless...eknowlen"
1,Paris street map,"The map laminated which makes it durable, it is also very clear and easy to read. My problem with it is that you cannot see the whole city at once. Maybe I did not register with me when I read the description, but a city map that you cannot unfold completely is pretty useless. There are no East-West, or North-South oriented streets in Paris. You simply cannot divide it horizontally or vertically.In other words, if you are planning to use this map on a trip, don't buy it. It is awkward."
3,Paris Streetwise Map a little small,"I teach French, and I got this for a project for my students. The map itself seems to fit very comfortably into a backpack, so would be very helpful for a person trekking through Paris. It is very durable and seems to have good detail of the city. It folds out accordion-like from left to right, then must be flipped front and back to see the north side and south side of Paris. It does cover the major areas of Paris, from a little west of the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe to a little east of the Pere LaChaise cemetery. However, it seems to take a little getting used to when going north and south. Half the city is on one side of the map, and the south side on the other, with some inserts around the outside of the map. A little cluttered and a little confusing, but worth the money I spent on it."
3,Good,"This is pretty good pop rock, nothing more or less. ""She's So High"" is a bonafide and deserving hit."
5,This progressive space rock album marks the new age.,"When I first heard ""She's so High"" played on the radio, I could sense that his style was testing the limits of Modern Rock. Few male artists of the 1990's can sing a melody with the vibrato, vocal range and beauty that Tal possesses. The Lyrics were refreshingly uplifting for a change. If you long for the quality and musicianship that we once knew in the late 60's and early 70's, Tal Bachman's debut CD is excellent in it's entirety; full of magical melodies, skillful guitar playing and imaginative compositions."
3,Tal Bachman's music is *unique*,"There is only one way to describe his voice... unique. It isn't filled with soul like Dave Matthews, it isn't bubble-gum pop like Robbie Williams, it isn't frat rock like Mark McGrath. While I liked ""She's So High"" and a few others, I would definately recommend anyone who liked ""She's So High"" to borrow the CD (I know stores like Borders let you listen to a CD before buying or not buying) or listen to most of the audio clips off the Internet before deciding to buy it or not. I personally didn't not like the CD, but would have preferred the single instead."
2,Overproduced empty 70s pop,"Very disappointing. None of the songs have intensity like ""She's so high"". Wimpy soft unmoving balads that just don't measure up. I thought synthesizer strings went out quite a while ago. Those inclined towards such drippy romantic excesses might dreamily enjoy this snoozer."
4,Pretty good for what it is.,"This is not my type of music. I prefer alternative bands like Green Day and BLink 182. However, Tal Bachman is pretty good, too, considering I don't typically care for this genre of music. Songs like ""(You Love) Like Nobody Loves Me"" and ""Shes So High"" are actually pretty good. Tal has a pretty good vioce, and he writes great, meanigful songs. My fav on this CD is ""Darker Side of Blue,"" but all the songs are pretty good. So, as I said, this is a cool CD, even is you're not an R&B fan. If you are, raise this rating to 5 stars."
4,Polished and Professional,"This young man is writing music way beyond his years. Although it may be his first album, it sounds as if he's been making albums for years already. This is a very slick production, and I mean that in a good way. Tal Bachman has a flair for powerful and dramatic chords that build to a pleasant crecendo that is very satisfying to the ears. The music is infectious, and should find a large audience. Every song is guaranteed to have you humming along, awaiting the next wonderful chord change. I seriously enjoyed this CD. Mark Lahren goopah@btigate.com"
2,Throw in the Tal kid,"I'm not trying to be mean, but Tal's voice just did not match his music. The lyrics in the songs were totally good and all, but I find my self getting more sick of his voice than anything. I think this cd is not worth buying a full price new, yet better if bought used. I'm not saying do not buy the cd at all, because the lyrics make up for a lot of stuff."
3,"Great tunes, a bit out of tune","This music is simply exhilarating. However, upon closer inspection, this ensemble isn't playing at a professional level. They're not together, not in tune and the musical possibilities aren't really explored. Just good readings by eager beavers."
1,Thoroughly disgusting!,"I was looking for a healthy snack, so I tried these. I did't expect seaweed to taste fishy - it's disgusting! I don't think I can eat these as a snack, maybe I'll try adding them to a soup. Won't be buying these again."
1,Tastes like the bottom of my aquarium smells,"I am very open minded and I love seafood, especially caviar, salmon, sardines, etc. I ordered a case of these seaweed chips based on the first two reviews posted below the product. I failed to notice they were dated in 2009 and it may be the recipe has changed since then.Irregardless, these chips are not salty, sweet and nutty tasting. They taste like the bottom of a fish tank smells. I am sure it is an acquired taste and perhaps they would improve if put into soup (along with other ingredients to mask the flavor.This product has exceeded my edibility boundaries. Yuck!"
2,tastes fishy!,Another reviewer wrote that you either love them or you hate them. I wish they had said why. It's because they taste fishy! Evidently a lot of people love fishy tasting food! If the only fish you'll eat is Captain D's then you probably won't like these. I'm giving mine to a sushi loving friend.
1,inaccurate ingredients list on amazon,"Ingredients list on Amazon website says: ""Seaweed (Finest Korean Kim), Sesame Oil, Sea Salt."" However, I was very disappointed what I received my order to find out on the package that Canola Oil comes before Sesame Oil. Canola Oil is a cheaper oil; it's not an oil we believe to be healthy. We don't understand how such a mistake can be made! Unfortunately, we took the 24 pack order on a 2 months overseas trip and will not be able to return the order."
2,Not as delicious as other brands,I was looking for seaweed as delicious as the kind they use to sell at my local grocery store. I thought I had found an amazing deal on amazon with Sea's Gift Korean seaweed. I was wrong. This is drier than other brands and less salty. The more delicious ones are 20 more calories per pack but worth it. These are still healthy and a better alternative to chips but i have to keep looking for the exact brand I like.
3,tastes good ...,"This tastes great, even my toddler devours it! Be careful when you order this - the amount of seaweed inside is roughly half of the Trader Joes pack. I find that I often need to open two for a snack - what a waste of packaging! Even my toddler can probably eat more in one sitting than is in one package. Might be good to pack in a kids lunchbox, but definitely too small of a pack for an adult. I hate to throw away so much wrapping packaging/ for such a tiny amount of food."
1,I have had many types of roasted seaweed--this one is pretty disgusting! STAY AWAY!,"I have been eating rosted nori all my life. I have to say this is a big disappointment. The seaweed tasted stale and disgusting. And this is not because I am not used to seaweed. Quite the contrary. I am even more disappointed when I tried to return this to Amazon, this item is actually not eligible for returns even though I just received this item. I don't understand. Basically I paid full price for stale food!"
3,Touch of confusion,Okay so I started to read the book and became lost. Now dont get me wrong I read and write what most would consider paranormal genre and I truly didnt get into this book until almost the very end. I thought it was well written but a wee bit lengthy in that it could have ended maybe a little earlier. But all in all an okay read but not the best I have seen to date mainly because when I read it I wasnt even sure what the plot was going to be at first or what would she become. I kept asking myself did I miss something?? But no I felt that way through the entire book and I read it twice.
3,Actually 2.5 star. This is nothing special . Predictable.,"Sorry, Just one of those books that I was glad to finish. Plot was predictable. The one character that could have added some zip to the action is killed off almost immediately. Just don't think I have it in me to get through the other signs."
1,The Comic Books,I coudn't suspend my disbelief. The heroine is sent to a kids store to learn about herself. Here kids write the comic books about the events as they occur. Are the kids pyschic? How else could they do that? Alternate worlds. Superpowers and immortality --but you age? They somehow can't figure out who the heroine's real identity is but it is obvious she is one of 2 sisters and one of them is dead???? This book sucks. Women readers and Comic book fiction do NOT mix. Unless you're 13. Sad because the writer can write --she just needs a good storyline to go with. One that appeals to grown women. We need more women who kick butt stories --just keep it within the realm of beleivable.
3,Different,"A fresh and interesting paranormal story with a comic book-type twist to the characters and world. It is very imaginative and different than the other paranormal stories that I've read.It is set in an alternate Las Vegas where a battle between good and evil is happening, but the regular citizens don't know about it. The lines between good and evil -light VS shadow- are very clearly drawn until our protagonist, a tough and damaged young woman, is brought onto the scene. She is part light and shadow and is believed to be the person who has been prophisized to come along and tip the balance and change things forever for whichever side she ultimately chooses to be on.It is the first book in a series that will be at least a trilogy. I thought that it was a nice change from the vamps, witches and werewolves that are dominating the paranormal market these days."
2,Too long drawn out,The previews looked like this would be a funny movie. Yes there were funny parts but the plot was not highly developed and it dragged on and on.
4,Funny & cute rom-com,"I am shocked that more people didn't respond to this one. It's a great movie with a hilarious supporting cast and cute love story too. It would make a good date movie or just watch it alone even, why not...Justin Long is adorable and the chemistry between the two main characters is obvious and nice to see on screen. Not bad at all & I definitely got a few laughs. This one's worth it...four stars!"
3,A disappointment.,"I had high hopes for Going the Distance but overall, I found this romantic comedy to be crude and rather bland. Most of the jokes in this film have a forced, and overly abrasive sense of humor, the sex references are just really lame and pointless. Another thing that didn't work was the very awkward chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Justin Long, they might have dated off-camera but the connection is just not there on-screen. Long's performance is pretty good but Barrymore who is always rather delightful in other films just looks uninspired and cranky in every scene. Going the Distance does have some tender and cute moments but this is just not a film that made me feel anything for these two characters struggling in a long-distance relationship. It's a mixed bag for me."
2,Not a Worthy Sequel,"I'm sorry- I loved the first book (Cooking With the Dead)- reccommended it to straight friends, bought extra copies, still cook from it, but the new one is some serious barrel bottom scrapings.Truly, we sound like idiots in this book. I won't offend well-meaning sisters and brothers by quoting particulars, but Zipern has not done deadheads any favors in bringing this out"
3,another overrated gergiev performence,"THIS IS MORE LIKE 2 STARS NOT THREE.Im sorry maybe im the only that can hear it but gergiev can not conduct tchaikovsky,i like him better as a opera conductor,his interpertation with tchaikovsky always seems brawny, robust and slavic some people like it but i dont, theres some things that he does well drama,added excitment but this performance suffures from ridiculus tempos and no melodic flow,he brings out the drama well but thats about it,wheres the emotion the passion it just seems gone, its just to personelized,though i liked the playing from the veinna philharmnic its just not enough.i would recommend ormandys 1960 philidelphia orchestra and charles dutiot montreal symphony version very underrated performence.stay away from mrvinsky leningrad very overrated"
5,SOOTHING............,"Most people are not aware of Jackie Gleason's orchestra and just don't know what they are missing. His music is absolutely beautiful, unique, and very soothing."
4,Mellow Christmas music,"Just so nice and easy Christmas music by the late Jacki Gleason's orchestra to make one comfortable and relaxed during Christmas, huh?"
1,absurd,"i received this book as a gift while in the hospital after the c-section birth of my son. my husband and i both read it, and agreed: what [junk]!apparently new motherhood was the closest that this pc liberal feminist from new york ever got to the real world, and it scared her so badly that she had to write a book reassuring other new moms (or reassuring herself?) that they would hate it, too.i gather from her writing (and from the fact that he is the *very* last person to be thanked) that her husband was not much help after the birth of her daughter. is that why there is almost a total lack of masculine pronouns in this book? is she ticked off at all men for her husband's lacking?"
2,BIG letdown after first two albums..,"I'm obviously in the minority here, but I think this alburm is nowhere near as good as the first two unless, of course, you like sappy, sugary r & b. The only song worth a second listen in ""Love in Vain"" Come on, Keb, you can do better than this! We need more stuff like ""Am I Wrong?"" from the first release or ""Perpetual Blues Machine"" from the second. No wonder you didn't play any of this so called music when you played at the New Orleans Jazzfest last year."
2,Falls below expectations,"Poor quality, and fails to deliver on performance due to poor quality and unusable design. Spiral cutter doesn't work at all because the screw is too fat, and grooves too shallow. V-cutting tool is dangerous, be careful otherwise it can easily cut your hands. Twin curl cutter is also very difficult to operate - needed a better handle."
4,A good introduction,"Okay, aside from the fact that you can't actually become an Adams, Stieglitz, or Cunningham in a weekend, the book is a good introduction. It is useful for beginners, and covers the basics well. It will not get you into the Magnum group, but it will improve the quality of your images (primarily by addressing some of the most common errors made by those learning how to make a photograph). I'd recommend it for the person who is genuinely interested in learning the basics of good photography."
4,Super swinging set!,"Great set by Louie and his group. Some boogaloo numbers and some salsa (guaguanco, etc.) supported by hot playing. Get it!"
2,Couldn't get into it,"I am honestly not getting what all the good reviews are about.I like most of Paul Schrader's films, but I really found this one boring, sorry to say, I much prefer the Renny Harlin version.For me, I just wasn't getting into the film.If you're like me, you'll like the Harlin version much better."
4,Very Good,"This is the original version of what was to become Exorcist: The Beginning, which was released last year. This is 100 times better than that. This isn't just a Special Edition of that movie, its an entirely different film. Different cast, different plot, different music, and a different exorcism.If you haven't seen The Beginning, don't. This is the real prequel to The Exorcist."
1,Godawful! Avoid this movie like the plague....,"Well, it looks like the studio made the right decision after all. I really enjoyed R. Harlin's film (""Exorcist: The Beginning"" was more shocking than I'd anticipated. Yes, it had flaws but I enjoyed it.) and had held hopes that Paul Schrader's version would be more ""psychological."" I don't know if I would have enjoyed this film more if I'd only seen it and had not already seen ""The Beginning"" but, I did not enjoy this film. It didn't offer anything that the beginning did not. In fact, I didn't even finish watching it. I think Uwe Boll (who is, no doubt, the worst director of all time..that's a whole new topic) could have done better. (actually, probably not. LOL) The scariest thing about this ""film"" is that I wasted $20 on it. Sadly,THAT might be the only thing about this movie that gives me nightmares...."
2,Disappointed!!,"I was very excited to see this movie after hearing it was better than the ""Beginning"" but boy was I disappointed. It could have used a little gore to keep it afloat. Even the original Exorcist used it's share of gore and we all know how great that movie was. Schrader should have extended the possession scenes. I mean come on, this boy was supposed to be possessed by Lucifer (I Am Perfection) the first angel, not some lowly demon. It is interesting to see the two different versions of this film and I did buy it to put with my collection. Just don't expect too much going in to see it. Oh did I mention the poor CGI...yikes!!!!"
3,Big hollywood made the right call,"This movie is the original version of Exorcist: the beginning as directed by Paul Schrader. Yes it is a descent movie in and of itself, but it just does not have the same ""chill"" factor of the Exorcist: the beginning that did get released into the theaters. The version that made the theaters gave more credit to the series, and this version basically had a feel of ""milking"" the series for another few dollars. If you had to choose which movie to see or buy, get Exorcist the Beginning, but if you are a collector, to have both is still worthwhile."
1,wire strippers,these are awful it states they strip 4 wires at once but it has a hard time stripping 1 wire.
2,Great Tool - Lousy Craftmanship,"I've purchased the Quick-Strip Cutters twice now. The first from the 800 # on TV, then online. The first purchase included a large and a small version. Both worked beautifully, the innovative way it stripped the wire was a great time saver (and so fun - I looked for wire to strip!).Unfortunately, the large pair broke. The pin that held the entire lever at the top broke, fell out, and no matter what I did, the tool was now a paperweight. But Wait! I still had the smaller version. They worked just as well, on most sized wire. They however broke the same way shortly thereafter.The online set was just as good. Both sizes working as advertised, so well in fact, I considered becoming an electrician...only for a millisecond; for just as the others, they broke the same way, same place, though the smaller ones lasted several months.I'll be buying them again, because they are so efficient and darn, I'll say it again...FUN! I would hope that they last a little longer."
4,nicely written,Very nicely written. Can help to provide a deeper understanding for the Jewish faith and traditions. A great add to my library.
5,movie,i received the item quick and in good cond and i will buy from this person again and i will let my friends know that this is a good person to buy from
2,EVIL TREEBEARD,"There really isn't a mandrake in the story. There is a plant that kills people, a cross between Treebeard and that thing on ""Evil Dead."" A rich man sends out a team to recover a dagger, a family heirloom that is 500 years old. They are able to find the grave and the dagger easily. Upon removing the dagger they release a curse which includes an evil tree creature. There are also natives in this area that sacrifice trespassers. Everyone fights everyone.Betsy Russell provides the token eye candy in this made for TV movie. Some blood, some killing, a little horror. No bad language, sex, or nudity. Great movie to let the kids watch before going out on the nature trail. Otherwise, you might want to avoid."
4,"Great Fit, Finish, Quality and Ease of Installation","Although sceptical, this product exceeded my expectations. Easy to install, with clear instructions. Looks great, even matches factory chrome pieces around window, etc."
1,Every Copy of this CD is DEFECTIVE,"Ever since ""Thunderball"" was issued on CD it has contained a defect. I have purchased 3 copies through the years and they all contain the same defect.On Track 5 titled ""The Bomb"" at exactly 2:40 and 2:41 minutes the sound goes dead and then skips a note as it returns. This is one of John Barry's best tracks on this album and it just ruins it, for me at least. I purchased my third copy just this last summer thinking the problem would have been corrected after all these years. It has not.As an interesting note, when this album was issued on Liberty audiocassette it did not contain this defect. When Liberty reissued the audiocassette simultaneously with the ""Thunderball"" CD it too contained the same defect. If you own these on audiocassette you will note that the serial numbers for both audiocassettes are different."
2,An average offering.,"While Stephen Adly Guirgis has become over the past few years a playwright who has established himeself as one of America's most interesting and bright, Den of Thieves marks a shakey beginning.The characters, all funny, quirky and contradictory in standard literate comedy terms hold up better than the story, which seems desperate and caught up in it's own funkiness.If for another reason than an early work by Guirgis, Den Of Thieves offers funny dialogue and bombastic characters."
1,Terrible pronunciation,The story drags along slowly no excitement.I normally love having audiobooks on my ipod to listen to while I am swimming / housework etc but this was dreadful.The reading was stilted many words were mispronounced I will never listen to another book read by this reader.
5,Awesome!,"These are excellent scissors. Expensive yes, but worth it, especially if you've ever cut your baby's skin with the clipper-type nail trimmers, tried to file them, bite them, etc. I bought these after a friend let me use hers. I am still using them on my pre-schooler. They make trimming nails very fast and remain sharp. I now give as a shower gift."
3,Uninspiring but adequate,"Dated and uninspiring format but still has the edge on more modern publications. Often the vocabulary used in the opening reading practice of a lesson isn't given until the following lesson. It's difficult to cross reference the material. There's plenty of grammatical points given but too often important ones are in brief footnotes which are difficult to refer to again without writing notes into the text. Poor dictionary at the end, especially English to Lithuanian. For all of these drawbacks, it's still a better grammar book than any I've seen to date."
4,A Bit Outdated But Better Than Ramoniene/Press,"Although some of the dialogs and readings could use updating, this text is thorough enough for a serious language student. I had previously tried learning from ""Colloquial Lithuanian"" by Ramoniene & Press, but found it lacked depth, which led me to this book. It has a solid reference section, with the exception of the dictionary, which is a bit thin. I especially liked the pronunciation section which really helps you to ""get"" the sounds that are unique to the language."
4,New Zealand Adventure,"This is an engaging book about New Zealand, written in a genial and self-revelatory manner, by an author who approaches the topic from his perspective as a psychiatrist, adventurer and successful financial trader. The author seems to have done everything and seen everything of interest on the Islands, in addition to getting to know a fascinating cross section of its inhabitants. He has accomplished the remarkable feat of capturing New Zealand's essence after a fairly brief but intense stay, developing an easy familiarity with the lay of the land and its history, as well as a good feel for the native people and recent arrivals, commerce and business, all painted in vivid colors, with warmth and affection. There are many subtle touches of humor on the pages of this book, pages which whiz by until one, regretfully, arrives at the last."
2,Good for information,"Dr. Elder definitely describes the places he visits in New Zealand adequately and the book gives some good information for people who are planning a trip in the future.However, I took many of his impressions about the people he met with a grain of salt. Dr. Elder seemed much more forgiving of people who may have erred if they had a good bottle of wine. He seemed harshly judgmental and impatient many times which made me regret purchasing the book, especially since the majority of the text deals with the people he met along the way."
2,Trying to impress you,I was very disappointed in this book as it really said nothing about NZ. Rather it is an attempt of one arrogant New Yorker's idea of how to impress you with how well he can judge people and wine.I couldn't finish it. This is rare for me as I am a compulsive reader. I don't usually review books....but if you want to know about NZ this is *not* the item.
1,Self Righteous nonsense,I brougth this with me to NZ on a current trip and left it behind at my last youth hostel. Not worth anymore of my time. I couldn't stand the tone of the book. It's written by someone who thinks far too highly of himself. He writes condescendingly about booking B&B stays and eating mussels and giving advice to fisherman about finding a specialist for hands. Obvious nonsense that anyone who has ever traveled has had to do do without feeling a need to write a book about it. Not much insight about the country of its people without it being filtered by a very wealthy person's tinted vision and with a need to make himself sound far superior than his audience.
1,Amateurish Travel Writing,"This book desperately needs an editor. Not only does the author repeat information several times, his spelling and grammar are atrocious. The author lacks respect for his reading audience which is mirrored by his smug disrespect for many of the people he meets in New Zealand.Perhaps an editor would have deleted his endless descriptions of meals, cigars, reckless driving, and liquor that crowd out more interesting details of his travels. I, for one, don't really care what he ate, smoked, drove, or drank through NZ. What does that have to do with his reader's knowledge of New Zealand?This book is a personal travel journal by an amateurish travel writer. I hope he will learn to be considerate of others and keep his future travel writing to himself."
2,Not all that,"I bought this book in preparation for a move to NZ for three years. It is a nice quaint little story, but not helpful in the least if one is traveling to NZ. I agree with the other reviewer about the whiny tone of the book. Apparently, Dr. Elder, like most Americans (unfortunately), feel that the world is theirs for consuming. I don't think that the book gave an accurate account of the people of NZ, nor the changing NZ culture in the face of rampant globalization, which is what I had hoped for given the author's expertise. One positive aspect of the book, however, is the historical introduction that it provides. It is well-weaved into the story and does provide a useful framework for learning more."
2,Just so-so,"I'm off to NZ in a few weeks and was excited by the other reviews of this book. It sounded like a magical tour through a magical land. And while the stories were somewhat compelling, I found myself constantly waiting for something deeper, more profound, more passionate. The descriptions and especially the emotions in the writing were very superficial. Eventually I got tired of reading about all the wine and food and put the book down. Each day is it's own 2-4 page chapter which leaves the book with an unsettled feeling. Yes, I appreciated getting to know a little about a lot of things. But all in all, I thought the book was flat."
1,Poor Proof Reading,"Since I've never been to New Zealand, I looked forward to this book.Every thing went fine until I got to page 52. After two words I thought-What is the reason I'm reading this stuff again--a typo?? then more similar words--What's going on??. I stopped went back to where I read these words before. I then found out that pages 21 to 52 were repeated. So The book starts nicely 1- 52; then 21- 52; then on to page 85. I can't believe a book which, is missing 30 some pages, could get through Proofreading and on to the publisher, printed and out to the book stores.I've read the book reviews--No mention of missing pages--VERY STRANGE.I returned the book, got my refund, so money wise I'm satisfied.For this reason I cannot recommend this book, unless you get it for FREEand or have an active imagination."
4,Stories of the soul,"I read a lot of books Cambodia. This is yet another collection of stories about people who survived the holocaust. My heart is always touched by such stories. These types of books are always similar even though the stories are specific to individuals there are common themes. If you are interested in more personal accounts there are 2 others which I would recommend. ""When Broken Glass Floats,"" and ""First They Killed My Father."""
4,DR. Beck's Class,"The book's illustrations were very interesting and creative. The story line was an accurate dipiction of slavery and the history behind it. It connected strong family ties from generation to generation with the beautiful basket weaves and family customs. Those who are associated with the geography of the book can make a strong personal connection to the atmosphere of the book. For teaching purposes, it relates the importance of family history and bonds throught the generations. It also shows how far we've developed as a society. It would be part of our text set for slavery in our classroom."
2,1 in 20 failed quickly ...,"I purchased 20 of these for my home. I've had them in for 2 weeks and I've had one fail already. I sincerely hope that the others last much, much longer than that. ** update: No more have failed in about 1 year of regular use. **The quality of the light has been good. It is a very ""white"" light. The bulbs do take a noticeable amount of time to get going -- when they first go on they are quite dim -- they brighten gradually over 3 to 5 minutes. I don't mind this, its kind of nice actually."
3,"Good dealer, product damaged","The dealer was honest, the package was closed and in it's original seal but the center of the DVD was cracked. Don't think they knew that when they sent it cause u can't see the disk so I don't think it was intentional. I was worried that the disk wouldn't play but it does so it's ok, however, I think it's susceptible to becoming a bigger crack and then it might not play. It's not from amazon themselves so I'm not sure what the return policy is"
5,ice crawlers,"This is an awesome movie that I saw.It has gore,creature violence,terror,action,an explosion.And the mostimportant thing a kinda happy ending.So do more good reviews for this movieok."
5,Wow.,This is a powerful and unusual novel. I'm surprised that Gray isn't more widely known. His writing is challenging but rewarding.
4,Late 60's psychedelic pop redone for the modern era,"This is a great album. If you like late Beatles or early Pink Floyd--or more contemporary bands like Ness, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, or The Warlocks, Silver Sunshine is the band for you.Poppy, but not in a bad way, this album is a great debut. Check it out!"
3,Winsome Wood hall table,"This table is very nice but it has one big problem: the 4 wood screws for attaching the lower shelf are the wrong length. The supplied 1.25 inch wood screws were too short to hold when screwed into the table legs. So I went to the local hardware store and purchased 4 similiar screws 1.625 inch length, and now the table is o.k. The price of the screws was only 50 cents, but the inconvenience was frustrating."
1,boring,i thought this was a film but instead it was a bunch of cut up episodes. and they were all boring. a total waste of cash...
4,Good product,"I ride a motorcycle so fog in the helmet is not a good thing. Bought this product on a recomendation of a fellow rider and what a difference it make. After using the cleaning wipes and then the Anti-Fog wipes, I nolonger have the fog problem on the visor. It is pretty interesting to be riding in 30+ weather and seeing your breath, but it doesn't stick to the visor."
2,Like Snorting Wasabi,Figured the reason this works for headaches is that the searing pain in your nostrils distracts from the pain in your head.
4,Operations Management Text Book,"Received the book in good shape, binding a little loose but not bad. Perfect condition for what I need it for."
4,Good Book,"Like most textbooks it depends on the teacher to make the material interesting. There is a free student companion site which I like, because several publishers make you put in a code and if you buy the book used, you end up having to buy the code. The only complaint is that it appears the student power point slides are not as comprehensive as the instructors."
3,Silly but fun,"I read this in about an hour ...(Sorry!). It's a reasonably intelligent, moderately amusing, and fairly witty read. Not one for the ages, but I suppose it's a kind of Maee Bincy or Terry McMillan for gay men. The epistolary form (here rendered in email messages) is an interesting change of pace, though the voices get a little repetitive at times. Also, without being tiresomely politically correct, I do wonder about the depiction of gay Asian men here (I'm white). True, Andrew is a wealthy, somewhat independent gay Asian (with daddy's money), but the others are depicted as childish or primitve--and Joey's fascination with them seems a little uncomfortable. I'd wait for the paperback, but it would be a fun beach or cruise read"
3,I was expecting better,"I like the premise of a novel written in the form of correspondences between the characters, and the premise worked well here. But I was disappointed in that it seemed to be slow in the first half, where it was not clear where the story was headed. Things picked up in the last part of the book a bit. The best part really was the ending, because it did not end up going down the predictable road I was expecting. I did not find it funny; indeed, all the humor seemed to depend on a stereotypical ""old queen"", whose cultural references were sometimes too obscure to generate a laugh. Also, I did not really care too much about most of the characters and found myself just wanting to get to the end to be done with it. If you want a good gay romance with this correspondence-exchange format, read ""Almost Like Being In Love"" by Steve Kluger.Almost Like Being in Love: A Novel"
4,Soothing,"Very soothing. Calms my baby everytime I play it! And yes, they actually do listen to music and enjoy it! I recommend this as an essential item for any new baby!"
1,terrible condition,"When delivered, the binding of this book was coming off. I was very disappointed in Amazon.com and am afraid to order in the future."
2,"Good Book, Horrible Transaction.","This book is very interesting and has ALOT of wonderful information, but when I bought this book, it was listed as ""like new"" when I received the book the covers and spine were completly removed from the book and a note accompanied the book saying ""this is how I got the book"", so now this book will have to become a perminent part of my collection since I cannot ethicly sell this book back to someone else as I intended."
2,Missed the big picture,"Doenitz clearly speaks with authority, given his role in WWII. However, he missed the big picture of what was happening and how some of his own decisions (e.g. constant radio contact) contributed to Germany's ultimate defeat.I found this book very difficult to read. You should either be well-rested or stock up on caffeine before tackling this tome. (hence, the two star rating)"
1,Total disappointment,"These came highly recommended to me and I was very disappointed to find that rather than grabbing and pulling stray hairs, the Rubis tweezer actually chopped the hair into a shorter stubble that was impossible to grab with any tweezer. My $8 tweezer from the drugstore works better. Waste of $."
5,Razer ExactMat,"Pretty simple decision, if you don't have one, get one. The Exactmat is the ""only"" mouse pad you should be using. I got so tired of the neoprene type pads, 1. they get dirty, 2. they come apart, 3. lots of mouse drag 4. they are too small. Once you own the ExactMat you will wonder why you ever used anything else and why it took you so long to put down the extra few bucks it takes to get one. Even though the ExactMat is more than two times more expensive than the ""neoprene"" type pads, it is by far the best bang for you buck in mouse pads. I am a CAD engineer with lots and lots of mouse time, I demand as close to effortless mouse sailing as I can get and the ExactMat is a joy to use. Am I over the edge, maybe, (don't tell anyone but I also sprayed both the ExactMat and the bottom of my mouse with silicone spray and then wipe it off for almost frictionless clicking). Bottom line: this is a great product and I can't imagine any user that would not benefit from using one."
3,Nice but flawed,"Although this product seems great, with the large size, substantial weight, and dual coatings it has one major flaw.The mouse I'm using, MX700, does not track properly on it. Neither side does. And oddly the rough side seems to offer less resistance on the mouse motion."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this instead of the Baby Bjorn, and ending up purchasing the Baby Bjorn after all. The Infantino just doesn't provide the support baby needs, and can be tricky to put on, especially when you're in a hurry. I've used a Baby Bjorn throughout my daughter's infancy, and it's still in great condition, ready to be used for the next baby."
2,Found better.,I've been through this one and a Snugli carrier and both were not very secure feeling or as easy to put on. I finally bought the Baby Bjorn carrier and have been so happy with it. I use the Baby Bjorn every time I go anywhere with my baby and my baby loves it. She goes to sleep in no time while in it. I guess because it's makes her feels secure.
3,not good for growing baby,"I thought this would be a great product. I could finally use this when the weather was nicer, but when my son was 4 months old and wanted to see where he was going. The flap never stays down and he usually ends up chewing on it. Also the straps are not easy to maneuver if you are putting in or removing baby."
5,great instant film,Better than the Polaroid it replaced. Excellent tonal range look and feel. Great product and I won local Photo contest with first pack against many digital 11x17 color prints. Good stuff.
5,One of the BEST Bond soundtracks!,"This remastered soundtrack from OHMSS is one of the best in all the 20 films. It has emotion, action, gentle interludes, drama and it draws you into the movie. I am so happy that many of the Bond soundtracks have been remastered since all I had most of them on were old LPs.This one stands out and if you are a Bond fan, you should enjoy the extra tracks on the new CD!"
4,This is why James Bond is O.H.M.S.S.!,"When I got this CD, from this very page, I thought ""Okay. The film was good, and I liked the music, so does that make the soundtrack good?"" The answer is: Yep! This is one of the best film soundtracks I've heard. Track 1, by Louis Armstrong, is one of the best James Bond themes I've heard! Track 2 contains clips of Barry's The James Bond Theme and totally expresses the feeling of the scene. And, all in all, this is an excellent soundtrack! I'd say buy it. If you like this CD, I also recommend ""For Your Eyes Only"", also available on Amazon.com."
3,why does it have to end so badly,This anime series had the potential of being one of the greatest but it ends just so badly. It doesnt seem they'll be making a follow up. When watching a series you shouldnt get the feeling that hmmmm was that it? Am i missing like 5 episodes!!! Up to the end i enjoyed the entire series good charachter development and plot.Except the series doesnt follow the same plot as the Mangna i mean where the hell is the skull knight? He never even shows up hes suppose to save Rickert and give Gatts the dragon slayer but it seems they seemed content with ending the series with Gatts having a clay in his eye and Caska getting rapped by demons i mean.... what the hell.
1,Very disapointing,"I just received this package and was looking forward to viewing it.However, I wass very dispointed.The Stockdale interview is the only good part of it.The rest of it is mostly made of a guy reading VERY technical minute to minute battle stories while showing battle scenes that probably have nothing to do with the narration as you can easily notice that they are showing the same battle scenes over and over, in loop!I'm sure there ia a much better product out there.But I haven't found it yet."
2,Cheap,"The narrator sounds like he's reading the script for the first time, and the footage is dark, grainy, and seems unrelated to the storyline.The best series on the Vietnam War is BattleFIELD Vietnam.A 12 hour, BBC produced series that aired on PBS over 10 years ago. It was released in the U.S. on VHS and in Europe on DVD, (PAL format). Incredibly good military history of the war, no political bias."
1,I feel bad..,"for the people who got roped into contributing to this project without knowing what the final product would look like.A blatant ripoff of BATTLEFIELD Vietnam..Only cost me like $4.99 while X-mas shopping at Marshall's, but I can't get back the time I wasted hoping it would get better as I watched."
5,Straight from the horse`s mouth,"This book by the first remote viewer is powerful because of who Ingo Swann is in remote viewing history. I have read everything around by the top remote viewers and what they have remote viewed this is by far the most interesting and enlightening because he was one of the first to do it after he left SRI. The fact he tells what he saw years later doesn`t diminish it. Today all these things are commonplace in todays literature of UFO`s and extraterrestrials and he corroborates them. His humorous writing style gets the reader involved because he is so down to earth in his opinions about the government, military and the CIA. A facinating read from a true pioneerin the field."
5,The essential Zombie reference,"The essential Zombies reference, with the history of the band and complete discogagraphy of every recording in every configuration issued through the publication date. Not a literary masterpiece, but a fine book that nicely fits an important niche. Well recommended."
2,Good watch....lousy lap/start button,"good functionality except for start/lap button. Big hassle if you're doing laps/repeats in the pool. You've either got to slam the button, or nearly stop your training and push the button hard. The audible beep is barely audible so you end up pushing the button several times...which gives you a few laps of 0.2 or 0.1 seconds. Hard to get a good average lap time when you throw in some extreme low values like 0.1 and 0.2."
2,dissappointing,"This book is really only a small bird species guide. It really doesn't tell how to care for birds much at all. If you want a small reference manual for caged bird species then this book is for you. If you want a bird care guide, look elsewhere."
3,Not Really Secure,"The problem I see is that they are not really secure. The ""tape"" does not extend to the edges and, even more problematic, they are, once sealed, easily opened and resealed with no indication they've been tampered with. The ""spit on the glue then seal"" type are far more secure (to me)."
5,GREAT Album.....Don't Listen to the Critics,"While this album was roundly panned by some of the so-called ""music critics"", I must disagree with them adamently on this one. I really liked this album, and it may well be one of the Doobie Brothers best efforts. I'm one of those fans who like the original Doobies sound (that is....pre-Michael McDonald), and that takes NOTHING away from Michael McDonald (he is a fantastic artist in his own right). This album just sounds like the Doobies efforts of the 1970's and Tom Johnston's lead vocals could not be any better. A fantasic, satisfying effort from arguably the best rock band of the 1970's. If you are a Doobie Bros. fan......you will love it."
4,A Heartwarming DVD For Christmas,"If you want to experience a ""feel good"" love story, especially around Christmastime, then you need to see ""Regarding Billy."" The principal character, Billy, played by Ronnie Kerr, is a truly believable--and loveable--person who always puts the needs of others before his own, as seen in his unselfish love toward his mentally challenged brother, Johnny, played by Jack Sway, after the death of their parents. Billy's unspoken and unexpressed love for his boyhood friend Dean, played by Jason Van Eman, brings just the right amount of tension to the storyline to keep everything interesting. And, of course, we are rewarded with a great ending when Billy summons his courage to tell Dean how he truly feels about him, and discovers that Dean feels the same way. Yes, indeed, it's always great to see the good guys win every now and then. If you're a hopeless romantic at heart, then check out ""Regarding Billy."" You won't be disappointed."
1,stinker-oo,"The plot was stupid, and not very interesting. The ending was so predictable, I figured it out before the first scene ended. The romantic nature of the story was forced, and seemed totally unrealistic. The main character keeps crying, his retarded brother keeps saying cutesy twaddle that tugs at the heart strings, and the jock looks cute and uninvolved all through the picture. This stuff went out with Shirley Temple. The hour and ten minutes went by like three hours. The music track was just an exercise in cheap sentiment. Avoid this movie like the plague. BORING!"
2,my mother died. boo hoo hoo.,"come on. the reviews for this movie are seriously disturbing. You cannot judge a movie just because of the biceps or just because it has a sweet happy ending. Honestly, there is no artistic merit in this film at all. The storyline is very contrived, as if it were a fairy tale or a fantasy of getting it on with your best friend who was in the army. Also, there is way too much crying and tragedy in the film and thirdly, I know the film has a low budget but look at ""Ethan Mao""! It too has a low budget but is more compelling. The scenes in Regarding Billy look like they are snapshots of some lousy karaoke mtvs. all in all, not the best indie gay film i have come across."
5,"Great thing, not only for DJs","For an amateur DJ as myself (small to medium home parties) this is a great device. It's not only great thing for the ""DJ activities"". I actually discovered this is a nice way to connect iPod to my stereo system. It provides nice output sound level and iPod finally sounds perfect on my main stereo. This last thing alone is an excellent reason to get this mixer."
2,Disappointed,"I think this book is nothing but a review of other books. It did little for me to deal with advising a youngster how to deal with death of people that are very important in his life. I am 72 years old, and the main male in a 8 year old boy's life. I could die at any given moment, and was in need of advise how to best prepare him in case. I am still looking for a book to help me with this project."
3,fun rock & roll and or pop!,"This music, is based in rock & roll, with direction to pop. It is from the 80s, and made in Argentina. Something for latinamericans like me."
5,Excellent guide,"This small book will fit in your pocket/bag so you can take it with you. each bird is depicted on a full two page spread - the left hand page is a photograph of the bird, while the right hand page gives a brief description of the bird. The description also includes information about similar looking birds, and a few of the author's notes to help with identification."
4,Fond Childhood memories . . .,"I can remember staying up very late on Saturday nights over a friend's house so that at some ungodly hour, on some channel I'm not even sure of today, G.L.O.W. would come on and we would be mesmerized! I don't think most people today would ""get it"" and you either love it or hate it. Watching this disk made me want to call my old grade school friend and invite him over for another round! On a side note the DVD and video are identical so the other review by D. Hoyt is relevant to this DVD release."
2,Teachers Beware,"Copyright restrictions allow NO copies or transparencies for classroom use to be made. I wish I had known that before I bought both books. It never occurred to me that a book written by educators for educators would have such restrictions.I rated the item two stars because of the inconvenience and $$$ lost, but to be fair...it is a good book for individual use."
5,"Sipping cognac by the fire, wearing my ascot and monacle","Actually, amped-up Texas blues and r-n-r. Scratchy, distortion fueled sound that must be played loud and often. Saw them live some years ago and was blown away-thought they were the future, and then they broke up."
3,"About ""The Youngerman Guns""","Lewis Patten is an immensely talented writer with many fine stories and novels to his credit.Unfortunately, this is one of his weakest books, and I finished it only with difficulty.If you're a Patten fan, skip this book.Not recommended."
3,He knew people and how to find their common ground.,"If only more people would try to negotiate in their lives like he did with other countries, we would be in a much better world."
2,Disappointed,"I don't think this service manual was written by people with hands on experience. Or they just aren't willing to share that experience with the reader. They generally say what needs to be done, just not how to do it! They don't tell you where the nuts and bolts are, or what size they are, that hold ""X"" on. They just say: remove ""X"". This service manual does have some value, but not much. Your still pretty on your own to figure out how to do the job with this manual. Although I think it's probably better than nothing at all. All I can say is I am Disappointed."
5,Terrific!,"SHE'S NO PRINCESS is a wonderful story of a young lady looking for love and a place to belong and a handsome calculated stuffed shirt looking to avoid love. Together sparks fly, scheming plans takes place and eventually love is found. This is a continuing tale of the GUILTY PLEASURES series. Be sure to first read, GUILTY PLEASURES, followed by HIS EVERY KISS and THE MARRIAGE BED."
3,because Guhrke can't write a bad book,"I gave this book 3 stars because of the writing. She's No Princess had the kind of heroine I dislike most--the spoiled little girl who wants her way and won't take no for an answer. I waited a long time to read this book, picked it up at a used book store, and will return it to said store. It was okay--only because Laura G. can't write a bad book. But, the attitude of the heroine kept this from being a keeper."
5,"A great anime, a horrible dub.","Yami No Matsuei is a really good anime, but... the English voices just killed me! Halfway through the first episode I decided to watch in its original Japanese, which is much better. But I'm a fan of subs in the first place, so perhaps my opinion is less valid?People tend to argue about if this should be considered shounen-ai or not. You could certainly argue it either way. But I think most people would agree that YnM is at least slightly shounen-ai. That being said, I think that both shounen-ai fans and those who aren't fans should be able to like this anime! ^_^[...]."
5,"True, funny and bleak as yesterday and tomorrow","Of all the books I've read written since the 1960s or so, I think this one will stand the test of time. It's a dazzler.Like watching a sleight of hand artist on a high wire who never makes a slip. I don't like a lot of so-called ""post-modern"" convoluted books (I have real trouble with Pynchon, for instance), but this one transcends the genre. I recently started DeLillo's Libra and already it's taken my breath away. Can't wait to read more of it. In my opinion, DeLillo is one of the finest writers of the last 25 years. Oh, hell,why be stingy? He's one of the dozen or so greatest American writers, period."
1,I was dying to read this book and ended up wondering why,"Although somewhat engaging for the first 100 pages, the book moved from interesting to banal. I had to force myself to finish it. I was especially disappointed since I had heard that it was extremely funny."
1,The archtype of everything wrong with modern lit.,"If you enjoy books where a faceful of minute observations takes the place of a plot, where the main character is a lunatic wandering around in a lunatic world, where the author is so involved in constructing some type of difficult to discover meaning that when you figure it out, you realize that his 'insight' was so inane that it wasn't really worth five minutes of effort. Yes Don, modern life is kind of odd and confusing sometimes, can we please move on. I would only recommend this book to you if you are the type of psuedo-intellectual who reads estoric books to reveal your superiority to an uncaring world, the type of person who bores others for hours about the beauty of modern art when you couldn't tell the difference between a Jackson Pollack painting and a painters dropcloth, this is the book for you. All others, you have been warned."
1,I prefer life to death.,"I read this book because a friend whose taste I respected recommended it. And by recommended it, I mean he said ""I didn't like it, but maybe you will."" Well, no. Droned on and on and on about death. The characters had no dimension- they were just mouthpieces so Delillo could set up conversations about death. I'm sorry, but I'm not that consumed by the thought of death. I will die one day, so will you, but for now I will enjoy life and not waste it obsessing over death. If you happen to have an unhealthy preoccupation with death, you will most likely enjoy this book, but I found it so terrible I almost wished for death. Writers like Hunter Thompson or Vonnegut or Tom Robbins or Keroauc will give you a much better insight into American culture, and are all FAR better writers."
4,Poetry 9 Action 1,"Imagery defeated action in this book by the score of 9 to 1. 90% of the book is like a museum exhibit with dialog. Nothing happens. Vivid imagery happens thanks to the narrator and somewhat humorous commentary happens thanks to the strange and socratic children and acquiantances, but you have to wait until the final 10% for action. It's curious because the physical action is rather compelling and very real. I don't know, 4 stars may not be enough, because I liked reading it."
3,"Based on reputation, I was expecting a postmodern masterpiece.","However, I discovered that it was more like second-rate J.G. Ballard crossed with The Simpsons, with a little bit of Barthelme and Vonnegut mixed in. In other words, I was disappointed. If your expectations aren't too high, it's actually not bad. It's an amusing diversion. But it's not the greatest American novel of the 80s as some people have proclaimed."
4,Fantastico!,"Hilarious and moving. I would have been happy to trawl through 'Underworld's 9,000-plus pages if they were all as good as the ones in this little marvel. A superb example of what a novel should be."
2,Black Noise,"The protagonist is a professor who intellectualizes his family, his career, and his experiences into existential angst, like a college sophomore strung out on Sartre and Camus. Characters talk alike, and the plot reminds me of static between radio channels. If this is satire, it rings hollow.The protagonist's father-in-law, the most lively character, makes a brief appearance, delivers snappy parting lines, and disappears forever. The book gets two stars because of that character and because the descriptions are good.Spare me another ""modern"" novel like this, limp in spirit, vapid in plot, short on progress toward meaningful resolution."
1,"Poorly written, poorly read","Although one would not know it from this book, words do have meanings and must be selected with at least minimal care. With no plot, no character development and no discernable raison d'etre, this book would probably not make it past a college level creative writing seminar. Don't waste your money buying it or your time reading it; there are too many other good books that deserve both."
2,"What I Liked, What I Didn't Like","*DISCLAIMER* >>> I only read 140 pages of this book.What I Liked:-The sentences, their structure and variety.What I Didn't Like:-The post-modernism. The book seemed more concerned with critiquing society than [something having to do with the characters/being human]."
4,A strange but good book,"I read through about half of this book without being sure if I liked it or not, but I realized that I couldn't put it down. All in all it's a great book that confusees you at times."
4,Good Book/Happy Reader,"When I first read the title I thought it was a controversial book on race issues, but it turned out be a satire on a society influenced by pressing technology and mass media. The protagonist is a college professor with a neurotic family. The author doesn't really do much in the character development on a personal level, but does an outstanding job in developing them through what they encounter on a day to day basis. This in my mind keeps to what I think the books tries to speak about; how the agents of technology shapes us, and this book does a superb job on a level of inanity that's enjoyable to read."
4,Good interesting book,White Noise is an excellent book to read as it incorporates the various aspects of popular culture and mass media in everyday life. DeLillo does a tremenous job in this novel.
2,Shameless Plagiarism,"Every good idea in this book comes directly from ""Gravity's Rainbow"". OK otherwise."
3,One Dimensional,"This book did raise some questions for me about how a human views death, but what annoyed me about the book is that all the characters are too similar. There are not enough differences for me to read and see contrasting points. Possibly that is what DeLillo was trying to achieve, but for me it just didn't work. It made the story and plot unemotional and unmoving."
3,marginal novel at best,A decent story with no endings. DeLillo's style is uninspiring and uninfluencial. This book probably should be read but just not re-read. I would recommened something with more emotion like Marquez or Roy.
3,At least he got the title right,"White Noise is supposed to be a book about our relationship to death: our fear of it and our fascination with it. It is supposed to raise deep and troublesome questions. Note the keyword ""supposed."" It should, but doesn't.The story, in as far as there is one, is dull and implausible. The characters are incomplete and shallow (with the exception of Heinrich, who sometimes comes alive). The dialogue is overly clever and strangely artificial. With this backdrop it should come as no surprise that the question of death is presented in a clumsy way. We never really have any reason to care about it, or the heartless creatures that so unconvincingly claim to be obsessed with it. I hate to admit it, but White Noise left me cold.Why then three stars instead of one, you may ask? Language. DeLillo may not have a story to tell, but he tells it anyhow, and he does it so elegantly you almost let him get away with it."
5,Wonderful !!!,"What a wonderful book!! Ricoeur talks about his life, his journey through philosophy, his thoughts, feelings and much more. He talks about his encounters with some of our centuries great philosophers, such as Heidegger, Jaspers, Marcel and Gadamer. From his childhood to his experience as a prisioner during W.W.II; talks about his teaching years in both Europe and USA (he makes an excelent analysis of the two cultures). A must read for anyone interested in philosophy, ethics, history, phenomenology, psychanalysis, religion, art, education, politics, european and american culture. A great introduction to his work and life. Very pleasant book. I highly recomend it!!"
5,Nice little chain saw for the right job,If you're only doing light cutting and do not want to cut down redwood trees this is a nice little saw. They solved the chain oil leakage problem described earlier by supplying a small plastic chain oil bottle that can be kept in the scabbard. Battery life is reasonable. Buy an extra though because charging is overnight.
1,Electric chain saw,Problem is that item is not compatable with Australian electrical supply . You should advise purchasers that such items cannot be used in countries that do not have the appropriate power supply
4,HARD TO ASSEMBLE,VERY GOOD ITEM-- ONCE YOU GET IT PUT TOGETHER--( HARD TO POSITION TO PUT BAR AND CHAIN ON) BUT WORKS BETTER THAN EXPECTED!
5,Great machine,"I wasn't sure about trying a battery chain saw but I'm glad that I did. This machine holds it's own & has done quite a lot of work in my overgrown, tropical backyard. It is easy to hold and use. I like the safety mechanisms built in so there is no chance of injury. Very happy with this chain saw. Worth while for small yard use."
1,"Chain Loosens, Oil Leaks","I have the B&D 18V hedgetrimmer, weedeater, and cordless broom and love them all. But the chainsaw is a different story. The chain constantly comes off and is almost impossible for one person to put back on. It doesn't help that the oil leaks all over the entire saw making it difficult to hold on to when adjusting chain. It has a significant kickback so use with care."
1,This book should be a zero!!!!,This book uses real names & sort of fake names of Clubs and meet & greets. He should have a law suit against using all the names. Anyone that knows of this auther and (I thought I did) knows the people & the places he is stating in this book. It is pure slander. Anyone that is in the lifestyle (really in the lifestyle) knows not to brag using real names against the person's wishes. Total NO NO. Which I am sure he does not know what NO means.
1,Garbage and Lies,"I don't know why people couldn't put this book down. I had avery hard time picking it up. It's the worst erotica I haveever read. If you can get past the typographical errors, you'llbe bored to death! The entire book is an attempt to boost hisown ego, using names of real people without their consent andput them in his own fantasies."
3,Conversational English-Cebuano Made Easy,"This is a simple textbook rather than a dictionary. The dictionary section is 89 pages long and is English to Cebuano only. There is no Cebuano to English dictionary section. This small 210 page book is 18 cm x 11 cm x 1 cm in size. It is paperback and printed on newsprint-style paper. Publisher: Jucip Books. Printed in Manilla, 2004."
1,If it worked it might be nice,I received two of these. First one would turn on but nothing happening with the fan no matter what I tried. Luckily the returns process wasn't tough. The second one came with scratches and a loud grinding noise coming from the fan so it went back as well.
2,"Bad, and def not worth the price","Loud, has loud beeping when selecting speeds, looks bulky, air comes out as sharp concentrated stream even during low setting. Sending it back.Overall, I was very dissappointed with this fan, and was fooled by the few good reviews on amazon. Elsewhere, this fan has received negative reviews and complaints, wish i had seen those reviews first."
4,Great little fan!,"I have only had this fan for a few weeks and it has received limited use so far..but wow! This is a great little fan that really moves the air for it's small size. I work in a call center environment and this thing is quiet enough to run with people on the phone all around me. It sounds like a white noise machine more than anything else. I love that it has a timer for 1, 2, or 4 hours of operation.I would definitely buy this fan again!"
5,great program,i like this program in themes and in back grounds and desktop danceresits have many thinks great and the media or mp3 onverter it help all the people to use and make the computer great in display
3,Aquarium is Beautiful,"There are alot of items on this CD, the Hyper-Bowl and the Aquarium screensaver are the best.."
3,"Not a Windows XP Media Center ""Upgrade""","I bought this hoping it would allow me to do some of the cool slideshows that XP Media Center allows you to do, but I was wrong. You can make a slideshow ""movie,"" and there are games and new backgrounds, etc., but not many photographic tools or anything ""productive"" for that matter. No big deal, since it was really cheap, but not for me personally."
1,Not worth the money!!,Don't even bother wasting your money!! The screen savers make your computer work way to hard they are not even worth using and the games have one level and then they expect you to pay for more. The Wallpapers are the only worth using with this software. All in all a rip off.
3,Squeezing the Customer - MS Plus Superpack for XP,"What there is of the package is okay. The aquarium screen saver is nice - has four fish in it. If you want more fish you have to BUY more fish. Yes, I said BUY more fish. This is insanely stupid. You pay good money for a program (in this case a screensaver) and you have to go somewhere on the internet and BUY more fish. This is yet another case of pushing the customer to the limit to get as much money as possible - squeeze until the pocket is completely dry! I'll just use four fish thanks. BUY MORE fish indeed!"
3,Buyer Beware - INCOMPLETE Set ! ! !,"Let me start off by saying that I am a BIG Queensryche fan and have enjoyed listening to all this music many times over, BUT !!!!!, this box set does not have the full original artwork, no lyrics, and no new artwork & info!. This is why I give it only a 3 star rating. If it had a booklet(s) with the photo's and lyrics, it EASILY would have been given a 5 star rating. It does have all the new bonus tracks which are great indeed and it also has the Promised Land CD ROM game with a booklet and a nice fold out sleeve, but over all this is a cheap way to package up these classic Queensryche recordings, when compared to the individual remasters that come with the lyrics and artwork. I feel like I was cheated. BUYER BEWARE ! ! ! !"
4,Good Plot,The writing was pretty good. I enjoyed the plot in this book - It was mysterious but easy to follow!
4,Stephanie gets man--s best friend,"All the crazy characters are back and Evanovich throws in a few more to keep the laughs rolling. With Ranger FTA (failed to appear) Stephanie refuses to go after him, but takes all other bounty cases, somewhat to her dismay. Grandma moves in and takes driving lessons. Are there going to be any cars left in New Jersey? Great book .. a little on the doggy side, when Stephanie acquires ""Bob."" Would have given a higher rating, but felt mystery was too secondary to humor. Then again, give this puppy a 5.0 As the acronym says... still ROFL"
3,Hot Six is not 'hot' at all,"in the book Stephine has to bring in Ranger and although she refuses to do so, two idots are following her around to get him for their boss, the bounty Hunter, Joyce, ends up following her too to get Ranger.i flet like Evanovich was trying to make is like the first Plum Novel, ONE FOR THE MONEY, becasue Ranger and Stephine have a little romance going on throughout... i felt like she was trying to top her first book and it was not working! the only charater that i really enjoyed thoughout was Carol. and thats about it."
3,Easy quick read,"Janet Evanovich's books are always a quick light read, so is this one too.Stephanie Plum is helping(???) Ranger this time to solve a murder of Gun Mafia's son where Ranger is the suspect.Of course, there are other incidents of apprehensions in the book. I ready variety of books and usually read Janet's when I want some laugh and quick easy read. I am not disappointed with this but at the end what happened with the money seems so made up, unreal. Whatever!!!...., in the last 40 pages the dots are connected.Yeah!!, Lula could have appeared more. I read it more for Lula :-)"
4,Best One Yet,"Love the series and this was a fantastic story in the series. Fun, sexy and hilarious, I love it and I look forward to reading the next one."
4,HOT SIX,"This is the sixth part in the Stephanie Plum series. None of these short, easy reads should be taken seriously, and if you are looking for a book to build brain cells, keep looking. You will enjoy this series more if you know what to expect out of the books and can read them for what they are: silly, fun, sexy, and full of giggles. All six, for me, have been light and funny, all six having the same flavor. But like eating six - not so good for you - yet, tasty potato chips, you tend to want another with a sense of mindless habitual consumption."
4,Cracks Me Up,"I started reading these books this past summer on vacation. When I came back to civilization I headed straight to the book store to find some more of them. For some reason, these books just crack me up. They are laugh out loud funny to me... Being from California, I guess the setting has a stong appeal - hard to believe that people actually live in New Jersey. Plus Stephanie is really a goof ball, very silly and mostly not very ""Sherlock Holmes-like"" at all. The plot is sort of secondary to the very well drawn characterizations and locations. I love her family and all the bad guys are really really slimy. Just a hoot."
3,worth buying,Not Teena Marie but this is worth buying. I can listen to this from beginning to end. Jesse Johnson did a good job with this group. To bad The Time ended (best band ever formed)
5,Outstanding Playyard,THis is one of the most well made durable play yard's I have ever seen. It was a real value. And its beautiful.
2,Disappointed,"I researched the Madison playard and decided on registering for it based on the reviews. I just set up the crib last week, my son is 3 months old, and I was very disappointed to find out that there are no sheets that fit the matress. Graco sheets fit but then the matress can no longer velcro to the base wghich is an important safety feature. I contacted Evenflo and they told me that they do not recommend usig a sheet. I find that silly, because how will you clean the matress?? Also the snaps of the bassinet broke after 3 uses. Evenflo said that part is backordered and they will ship it in 3-4 weeks. By then my son will no longer need the bassinet portion of the playard. I ended up returning the crib to Babies-r-us and purchasing a Graco instead."
4,I Love It!,This playard is gorgeous! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors & it's so durable! I use this same playard (*in seamist print) @ my FIL's home so I knew buying this one would work great for my home! & I was right! But what is more appealing about this playard are the arched sides it makes it look so elegant! & it's perfect for your lil boy OR girl! I wouldhave given it 5 stars but they still didn't fix the minor downfalls I had w/the Seamist playard! But it's still a great buy for the price!
4,Still missing stereo cuts on key recordings,"For years I've been buying supposedly newly found versions of the early and mid hits of Del in stereo. First, 'Runaway' appeared. Later, 'Hat's Off to Larry' finally was released in stereo form. However, the next set of songs - namely 'So Long Baby', 'I Won't Be There' and many more are still only being released in mono form. Unfortunately, when you look at the track info, it is very deceptive, because some cuts are tagged as (mono), some (stereo) and many with no designation whatsoever. Thus, I give this compilation 4 stars for offering many, many tracks. I also subtract 1 star because the songs I really want to acquire in stereo are still not here. Very disappointing..."
3,Got hosed on the price,"I needed packing tape, but I probably should have shopped around for a good price instead of assuming that Amazon Grocery would send me a deal (as it usually does in the past). The tape works great (I find that tape is one of those things that you actually get more quality with the brand names), the dispenser is a bit bulky and large but works fine. But I found 8pks of packing tape at my local warehouse club store for about a third of this price, which is currently listing on Amazon for around $67. I've definitely got buyer's remorse on this one."
1,Not sticky at all -- utterly useless!,"I don't know who all these people are posting 5-star reviews of tape (who would be motivated enough by their packaging experience to do that?), but I suspect they are sock-puppets for Scotch. Now, it's possible that I got defective tape, but I bought several rolls and had to throw them all out. The tape would not stick to cardboard, period. After trying to tape a box for shipping, I could pull all of the tape off without damaging the cardboard in the least. It is basically just plastic strip that is *very* mildly tacky. I could run it between my fingers with very little friction at all. Certainly this is not suitable for packaging anything. I guess maybe you could use it for masking, as it would pull away from the wall very easily without damaging, but would also allow paint to leak under the tape, as it does not adhere to any surface."
1,Packaging tape not sticking at all,The review is kind of a mix. This deal comes with 6 rolls of tapes but 3 out of 6 not sticking at all. Can't even stick to a piece of copy paper.
2,Not as great as I thought.....,"After reading all the reviews for this baby journal, I couldn't wait to receive it. It is pretty - the colors and set up is fun and different, but I was really disappointed in the overall book. There is not a lot of room to insert photos and other memoirs......which is why I will be returning it for a book that offers much more space for these items."
4,A Quick & Accurate baby journal... easy to record facts.,"This baby journal is simple and quick to record the baby's information in. I purchased this book when my daughter was 3 months old and was able to quickly make it current with her age. I love the milestone pages because it reminds the parent what milestones to be watching for. It's a nice baby book for any parent who wants to keep record of their baby's developement, but who doesn't have tons of time to do the recording. There will be no horrified stares at blank pages in this baby book.I have purchased and completed four of these journals for my 4 children... and just purchased my 5th book for baby #5 who is due in 5 weeks... I love the simplicity and thoroughness of this journal!!"
1,Bad CD,"I don't know if I would have liked it or not, the CD would not play or load on CD player. Hopefully future customers will not have my bad experience!"
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"This cookbook contains a decent variety of recipes, but seems more geared towards low fat cooking than low sodium cooking. If you're casually trying to reduce sodium a bit this may be fine, but if you're on a very strict diet many of the recipes probably won't be acceptable. I found many of the recipes a bit unimaginative and lacking excitement, being perhaps geared towards people who find mild picante sauce too spicy. And the book itself sounds like it was written by a government lawyer trying to avoid litigation with frequent use of awkward terms such as ""acceptable vegetable oil"" in recipes. There are better choices out there."
4,This Book Made Me Feel Prime,"Mesler is truly a talent to be praised. TALK: A NOVEL IN DIALOGUE is an exceptional piece of Literature that allows the reader a fantastic view of a provocative married life, faithful or not. Any person who enjoys reading sultry narration (dialogue) needs to pick up this book and feast. The people who write novels like this belong to the ages. Mesler is a magician of words."
3,Incredibly enlightening but hard to comprehend at first.,"This book will be of tremendous use to you only if you manage to take it as a whole. People don't like that these days, they want instructional books as a collection of easily digested factiods. Alexander's book matches the conception of the human self that it describes: it cannot be broken down into different parts but must be dealt with as a whole. You come to understand more and more as you read, but you don't really see what he's saying until you can consider the whole book in retrospect. So it takes some work, but in that regard it's a brilliant analog to the ideas it contains: you must read this book holistically, just as you must deal with your self holistically."
4,Fantastic for a first book,"I, like the majority, really liked it an found it original. Fantastic alien culture!!! Great religion, great view of life at that cusp.Got me so involved, I stayed up till 4 in the morning to finish it."
2,sorry but i found it boring!!!,"Ok, here it goes...with all due respect to my fellow reviewers, I have to say , sorry , but I found it extremely boring. I am more of a fan towards the series that would appeal to an ""american"" audience, where more action, and a faster pace is present. I am accustomed to series like NIP AND TUCK, DEXTER, WHITE COLLAR, SONS OF ANARCHY,etc, so this series really had no appeal to me on an entertainement level. I barely got through the first disc, and couldn't finish the second one. all of this of course is my own personal opinion, since I am not a movie critic,neither am I trying to be one. This series will appeal to fans of Agatha Christie, or maybe of Sherlock Holmes, but if one is looking for a fast pace, action, intense dialogue....hum...look elsewhere."
1,wrongly listed as hardcopy,"We've greatly enjoyed the Foyle's War DVD series, despite lack of subtitles, but wanted more backstory, so ordered from Amazon the Simon Passmore Foyle's War HARDCOPY listed on Amazon, and were disappointed to see there was no book available, just the DVDs. I consider this false advertising. Despite receiving a refund upon return, I see that it is still falsely advertised on Amazon.com as a hardcopy book."
5,Brilliant,"All four episodes in this series are totally absorbing. The pace, the acting, and the script hold your attention. This set was money well spent. The second series has been released in the UK, I trust it will soon be released on Amazon."
1,Horrible message to both straights and gays,"I thought this would be an interesting movie about the history of homosexual characters in cinema but it turned out to be a guy searching for any slight hint of a gay stereotype that most nobody else would see. Even gay people. If a character in a movie talks too sophisticated, is interested in the theater, or just likes hanging around his male best friend, he must be gay. To me, this kind of attitude is what makes many straight actors stay away from these kinds of roles and instead choose the roles that are mean spirited towards gays. Now a guy can't even get another guy a cup of coffee without some wacko out there thinking he's gay."
2,Sistema Pressure Washer,Unit arrived with no marks on packaging but the unit inside had a broken case in three places. After a call to warrantee service I as issued a return authorization and the unit was repaired and returned.
2,Poor quality of picture and sound,"I had previously purchased 4 EMI classics DVD's and was satisfied with all. Thus I was very disappointed by the poor sound and picture quality on this DVD and have returned it. The Heifetz Mendelssohn is the worst. The Rubinstein Beethoven is better, but the muted sound of the orchestra in the Beethoven is not good. The Piatigorsky Walton has some bad picture problems near the beginning, but overall the picture is OK (not great, however), while the sound varies. There is no point in buying any of these DVD's just for the sound, in my opinion. If the picture is bad, don't buy. And if the sound is bad, too, then definitely don't buy."
3,Not the book I ordered,The book i received is not what is pictured. It was leather bound easton press but the nicer cover pictured is not what I received.
5,Great product! Great people!,My package came earlier than I was expecting. It is in great condition and will get lots of use!!!! You are the best!!!! I will order from you again!!!!
4,americantis,"Cleaver lyrics on a myrid of subjects in the fine tradition of singer,songwriter.The sprinkling in of harmonica always works for me being a player myself.I particularly enjoyed Grown up now and Less polite."
5,Hot Damn!,"This is a very nice cookbook with tasty, easy to cook recipes involving ingredients that are commonly found.It should be stated, however, that some directions are so simple that they lack clarity.Also, many recipes involve usually alot of butter or cream, giving this book a noticably french sentiment."
5,Lightning Across the Pages,"I don't know how a reader of this brilliant work could consider it stodgy and predictable as some dolt observed in a review printed above. This work moves like a bolt of lightning across the page. The plot and characters grabbed me by the throat from the first chapter and didn't let up until it ended. What delicious torture. Garcia-Roza's detective protagonist is wonderfully fresh and human, unlike any principal character I've encountered in the detective genre. I've read all of the work in this series save two. and I can't wait to get my hands on them.George GilbertSan Francisco"
3,A leisurely trip to Rio,"Maybe I'm an impatient reader, but I found the pace of this mystery leisurely to the point of glacial. The translation seems pretty mundane as well, rendering the dialog stilted and formulaic. I did appreciate the author's descriptions of Rio as the story eventually unfolds. Despite four murders (and a few more killings) the only real action in the entire story is confined to the final dozen pages or so. Despite the shortcomings, the setting kept me slogging along, hoping the pace would eventually pick up."
1,Rip Off,"The cost of 4 bottles of soda (2L of Inca Kola) was $36, the cost of regular ground 2 week shipping was about $32. So the total cost for this soda was $17 per bottle.Since my young son ordered this, I didn't know what he did. Obviously, he won't have access again to order any thing where web sites can take advantage of people."
5,Passing,I bought two books and both brought fresh ideas on widow hood and life. If your in the same place these books are a must to survive widow hood.
4,"Pro or Con, Too Much Too Soon","I was a very new widow when I read the book the first time. Many things did not apply to me at that time, like dating or remarrying. The first few chapters were so wordy that I got lost. The later chapters were not so wordy and everything made more sense. The book helped me to understand what I was going through. Now that some time has passed, I think I will read it again and see if I get the same response from the contents. I loaned the book to another widow who is 20 years older than me and she had a different response. I think age does make a difference in the way the book is received."
4,widow to widow,"This book is one of the best informative and supportive book on widowhood. It is written by a woman who lost her husband and knows how to relate because she has ""walked the walk""!!"
5,This is a great tool for widows!,"This is a must have for widows! I just started reading this book, but so far all of the stages of grief are spot on!"
4,Ordered for My Newly Widowed Mom,We lost my Dad about 3 months ago and my mom was having such a difficult time adjusting after 65+ years of marriage. I appreciated the fact that Amazon.com shipped it directly to her so quickly and she read it right away. It is full of practical advice; something that was helpful to her at the time.
5,IT WORKED FOR ME,"November 2007, I was hospitalized for 7 days and I was at least a pack or more a day smoker. I asked the hospital to give me the PATCH to help with the withdrawals from not being able to smoke. At this time I was 53 years old and had been smoking full time by the time I was 17 years old (36 years). The patch was a life saver. I did still have some cravings, but I was able to get over them rather well. When I went home I continued the steps of the patch. I did have one cigarette after going home and discovered that I couldn't stand the taste and wondered how I use to think it tasted good. Well it is now February 3, 2013 and I am still a non-smoker. I never thought I would be able to quite. It feels good that I am not tied to cigarettss anymore...THE PATCH REALLY, REALLY WORKED FOR ME. If I could quit after smoking for 36 years, anyone can!!!! DO IT NOW!!!! JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I DID ALL (3) STEPS."
5,It works if you want it to work!,"It is not easy but as others said, if you really want to, you can quit. I had urges every now and then not too bad, but the secret is to remember that there is no such thing as ""just one"". You have to constantly remind yourself that if you give up and light-up ""just one"" cigarette all your effort was in vain, and for what? You don't really need it anymore, so why ruin a good thing?The patches worked for me, I am now on step 2 (over a month smoke free). I hope they work for you, too. Good luck!"
1,EXPIRE DATE 3/2012 ORDERED IN JUNE 2012,"I USED MINE, BUT HUSBAND HAS NOT OPENED HIS, MINE SAID EXPIRE DATE 3/2012. SAD. IT WORKED BUT MAYBE WOULD HAVE WORKED BETTER IF IT HAS NOT EXPIRED."
2,"Convenient design, but inadequate detail","The Streetwise London map is very convenient if you limit yourself to central London and only need to find important attractions and/or streets of major or moderate significance. But many smaller streets in central London are NOT even named on the map and are not listed in the index. This was definitely a problem for me in finding smaller hotels, restaurants, etc. and lesser tourist attractions. In addition, the map includes some decent subway information, but nothing about buses. The reason for these inadequacies appears to be that the map is not detailed enough for there to be room to label the smaller streets and lesser tourist attractions. In summary, I suspect that this map will work better for first-time visitors than for repeat visitors."
1,"magnifier, please","This is not a usable map. It is so small, that it would be impossible to follow in anything but broad daylight and even then it would be difficult to use."
4,Solid,"This book gives a very good, solid overview of the legal requirements of a working band. Highly recommended for musicians at all levels of the business."
5,Un libro para leer a tus hijos y volver a soñar,Mi padre solia leernos este libro a mi y a mis hermanos. Ahora yo tengo la dicha de hacerlo con mi hijo y todo cabe en mi kindle.

4,"A Stately Menuhin, wonderful footage of 3 concertos","This set of Black and White recordings were made in the 1960's. Menuhin is around 50 years old and appears very stately, and composed. He plays wonderful Beethoven, it's almost as if he is immersed in it and communing with Beethoven himself. The expressiveness and the way he closes his eyes and feels the music shows his understanding and grasp of Beethoven. For the Mozart concerto, Menuhin conducts and plays the violin part, much like Mozart would probably have done. Bruch is very emotional and Menuhin is best at really getting into the pathos of the piece. Later in life, Menuhin would concentrate more and more on conducting, and as seen in the Mozart, he really feels the music, whether playing or conducting. This is one DVD to add to your collection of 20th century violin superstars."
4,consciousness in compartments,"The themes aren't new, but Victor Pelevin puts them through a distinctly modern and Russian lens in his novella The Yellow Arrow. Superficially, this work involves finding the universal scenario of finding ourselves stuck on trains with, shall we say, an abrupt ending rapidly approaching. The story isn't as much about a fiery and grandiose end as it is about ourselves throughout the process. Indeed, this story is more metaphorical and philosophical, providing doses of levity within its doubtless Russian based allusions and symbolism. Through the seemingly degrading classes and compartments of a train, it's mainly a contemplative progression, pondering the nature of time and more particularly consciousness. Moving from beyond the small time swindlers in the dining compartment to the funerals held in corridors, it's a story about acknowledging the graffiti in the bathroom that's meant for our eyes that will ultimately help us apply the brakes."
3,Brush Up Your Spanish,"If you haven't kept in touch with the language, or need exercises to solidify the learning process, this is a good book to use. It would be useful if it had several self-correcting tests"
2,Tough,This is a tough watch with a few flaws. The wristband pins have bent and failed causing me to almost lose the watch. The battery died after only two years. It will cost nearly $100 to replace the battery and do a pressure test.
2,Not much there...,"The book is short (just over 100 small pages of text with lots of diagrams and photos), and so the coverage of topics is pretty shallow. Most of the information is stuff you can find yourself by scouring the web for an afternoon (throws, marks, defense, offense, and drills). The writing is mediocre, and so are the diagrams."
5,Superb Starter Book!,"I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to learn more about ultimate frisbee. Twenty years ago I was playing this game in a midwestern college, only to return to West Virginia and receive blank stares when I mentioned the term. Now the sport has grown, with West Virginians as well as people from all over the globe playing! This title is evidence of the sport's growing popularity.Studarus starts with the basics of ultimate, including the rules of the game, the spirit of the game, and numerous descriptions of how to throw a disc. He then covers a number of offenses, defenses, and drills to sharpen skills. The book concludes with some historical information regarding prominent ultimate teams and well-known ultimate players.If you're new to ultimate frisbee and want to learn more, this title is the one to get. If you're a seasoned ultimate player and don't have this book in your library, it would be a wise investment as a basic primer."

1,A disservice to a great composer,"You might assume, as I did, that this would be an album of solo piano instrumentals written and performed by Augustin Lara, who is a justifiably famous songwriter and a hero to the Mexicans. Unfortunately, the performers are a couple of unknowns. The instrumentation is not solo piano but multiple instruments, all of which sound fake. Sounds like someone got an electronic keyboard with a built-in drum, string section, and chorus. Pure Shlock."
5,Latin instrumental.,"Great CD for latin music lovers, and Augustin Lara is phenominal!! Great CD, I love it. His music is wonderful and soothing to listen to, the rhythms are wonderful and one does not get tired listening to it."
3,BETTER COLLECTIONS OUT THERE NOW,"Anyone who is a fan of the incomparable Martha Davis will probably want this CD since it has some cuts on it that are just really hard to get otherwise.But there are other ""greatest hits"" or ""anthologies"" out there of the MOTELS that are much, much nicer sonically. It would be hard to go wrong with CLASSIC MASTERS or the ESSENTIAL COLLECTION even though both of those CDs have fewer cuts on them.Had to rate this down to a 3 STAR because the sound quality of it grates on me and makes me not play the CD all the way thru most of the time.Hey Capitol, when are you gonna release a remastered LITTLE ROBBERS, the best album that the MOTELS ever did?"
1,drug lordz,"This is a piece of junk, low budget movie. Do not waste your time and money its not worth, reviewing it."
1,breaks,"I've come to check these reviews after 3 months of using my sony player because the cd player stopped working. Another customer says the same thing happened to him after 9 months.All i know is that it worked perfectly until two days ago when it started giving me ""No Disc"" messages everytime i tried to play a cd. Very Frustrating."
1,If I could give it ZERO stars I would,"The unit has good sound and plenty of power, but as you'll read from others it breaks easily. Mine stopped working after only a few weeks - bad tuner. so I said ""Oh well, that's why I bought a Sony - good design, good warranty - Hah! You cannot bring these devices to any Sony authorized repair shop. You MUST ship it to Texas and for me that meant about $20-$30 because the unit is heavy and I'm on the east coast. so in reality the Sony 1 year warranty is worthless unless you live near Texas.My advice - buy a Panasonic. I wish I had."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTING,"I was excited to receive this product and start using it to catch bugs for my bearded dragon. Within the first 5 minutes out of the box I pushed the trigger in and when I released it the vacuum remained on. Now I have to keep the battery housing loose and push up on it when I want it to go on and off. It also has very dissapointing power, you can't even pick up the bug until you have the opening of the vacuum completely covering it, even on the highest setting. Overall this was a very dissapointing purchase and wouldn't reccomend it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was VERY disappointed in this product's ability to suck live bugs into it's chamber. I even changed the batteries and it STILL would not remove bugs from any surface I tried to lift them from. It would not even suck a mosquito into the chamber let alone an ant. I considered this toy a complete waste of money and even though there were return instructions, the only pleasure I derived from this product was hearing it hit the bottom of my trash can!"
2,not the same lagerfeld,"not the same lagerfeld anymore! this ""NEW"" lagerfeld is much weaker than it used to be in the 90s.very big disappointment."
4,good fireside reading,"engaging book about an english mum with a hotel and heartbreak to boot esp. missing her dear husband being dead and all. Mum is trying to keep the Pennyfoot Hotel running with it's accompanying high and low society types. You can relate to all the characters, sounds like the people in your own town. Enjoy this one in front of a fire with a good drink and a large popcorn."
5,Charlie's Angels music,"I have one word to say. Wow! This soundtrack is amazing. It has some of the best songs from the 70's and 80's. I encourage everyone to buy this CD it's great.track 1 5/5 very catchy, and a great new song.track 2 4/5 good Elton John song remake. It' so good.track 3 4/5 David Bowie has done it.

3,Does anyone know this song?,"Hello,I was just wondering what the song is that is played during the start of the motorcycle race. It has a nice beat and i wanna learn it on guitar. Can anyone please tell me what it is called?Thx."
1,Does anyone know what song is playing on the juke box?,I was wondering if anyone knows what song is playing on the juke box during the movie?
3,Question about song,What's the name of that song they play as Louis Stevens (Leo) is entering Bosley's (Bernie Mac) house? Its an old one.ANSWER: Nothing But a G Thing by Snoop Dogg & Dr Dre
3,ehhhh...coulda been better,"Sure, all the songs on here are pretty good -- but what's the deal? They didn't include any of the Prodigy songs from the movie or Rage. I think it's safe to say we would much rather have those songs included on the soundtrack rather than than the torturous song ""Last Dance."""
3,song??? need help please.,"does anyone know the song, in which the charlies angels find out that demi moore is bad, when she turns around on that platform and shoots that one guy from terminator( liquid metal guy ) , it kind of starts out like a synthesizer sound. please tell me thanks you."
5,Amazing characterization,"I've been an avid Koontz fan for years, but this book tops the list for me. The characters were so real; I felt like I knew China. I finished the book at 4:00a.m. and couldn't go to sleep after that! The story was captivating from the first few pages. A definite ""must read!&quot"
1,Same old thing from Koontz,I think Koontz peaked a while ago and now he has traded in suspense and horror for gore and graphic sadism. I was ready to tear my hair out a few times because he can't seem to move things along at a good pace -- He insists on describing the living hell out of each scene and dragging it out to the point where it's almost unbearable. I think his readers are extremely undemanding -- why else all the five-star reviews? It's beyond my comprehension!
1,I'm in the minority -- I thought it was a big yawn,"I thought it was a lousy book. The main character was just another typical cookie-cutter Koontz heroine. They're all the same. I'd swear that the escape from the chains/chair was related in ""real time."" Did it really have to go on that long? I saw the big ""twist"" coming a mile away.Also, the thing that bugged me the most: The killer is, well, killing or something and he thinks, ""This was exciting... In fact, it was... INTENSE!"" Get it? Because that's the name of the book. The killer loves the feeling of... INTENSITY! So he has to keep repeating the word INTENSE! Usually I pass books on to someone when I'm finished and know I don't want to keep it for myself, but with not the least bit of a feeling of INTENSITY I tossed this one in the trash."
3,Intensity... may contain spoilers.,"I like to keep an open mind about books, so I tend to read most or all of the book before deciding it's not worth my time.I read half of Intensity and found myself gritting my teeth everytime I had to listen to the so called ""villian"" voice his opinion about things, both important and mundane. I wanted, during several of his spouts about wanting to kill things because it's extreme, and this and that because he's just so great, to just throw the book out. He's really redundant... and if I do say so myself, a stupid character.The main character, Chyna, is also redundant... she herself took the liberty of explaining a saying she came up with as a child... in no less than 4 pages... it wasn't really nessisary to go back to the same area in her childhood every few paragraphs and explain it over, and over again.All in all it's a book I'd recommend to people with ALOT of patients. I'd like the hours I spent reading it back please."
2,First time Dean Koontz reader,"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker and, while I found the first 80 pages horrific but captivating, the rest of the novel lacked creativity and I found myself reading on only to see what implausible thing Chyna would do next. Dean Koontz will not make my reading list again."
5,INTENSITY,This book pulled me in from the first few pages. Every page kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. Best book I've read in a long time.
5,What an apt title - this book was INTENSE!,"My first Koontz read and I was hooked! If there was ever a definition of ""suspense novel"", this is it. I couldn't put it down and I have read a lot of so called suspense novels, but this one is the ultimate! Wonderful read and enjoyed every moment of this intense novel! My heart raced with the heroine of this novel every minute of the way. The detailed descriptions during moments in the book when the killer didn't know of her existence were enough to start butterflies in my stomach... I hope Koontz's other books are as enjoyable as this one."
4,As the title says.......INTENSE,"I really enjoyed this book. I listened to it in the unabridged audio book version. Reader Kate Burton was fantastic. I almost gave this book 5 stars. The only thing that held me back was the periodic excess tangents that the author went off on. BUT, don't get me wrong; this is a highly recommended book. I was sad as I approached what I knew was the end. I wished it had ended a little differently but, hey, it worked. This book is a GOOD view into the demented mind of a psychopath. Chyna was a strong heroine character, liked her a lot."
3,Elk,Where is the closure on the elk? What was their purpose? Where was the follow through? Did I miss something?
4,Well done Mr. Koontz,"Finally, a Koontz book worth purchasing! All I will say about this one is that it truly is a ""page turner"". The bad guy in this novel, Mr. Edgler Foreman Vess, is one of the most terrifying psychopaths I've encountered in a novel. Calm, Cool, Collected, and completely out of his mind!Bottom Line: This book will not change your life, however, it is extremely entertaining, full of suspense and (FINALLY a Koontz book that is) eerily realistic. Well done Mr. Koontz!"
5,great book!,"Dean Koontz is a great author. I love the way he puts detail into his stories and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Now, I'm onlly 14 but i still know a good book when i read one, and this is a very good book and I reccomend it to anyone who likes detailed, ""cool"" books."
3,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, this was not one of his best works. The storyline was intriguing but there were times when the action was strung out between pages of uninteresting and unneeded rambling. It lost my interest several times. I did, however complete the book because I am an avid Koonce reader and I knew that there would be a surprise ending. It just seemed to lack the constant, compelling suspense that his other works have."
4,Great book but there are better,"I recently starting reading Dean Koontz books since I finished reading all the Stephen King books who I absolutely love. I chose Intensity because of all the great reviews I read on it. I really enjoyed the first half of the book. I couldn't put it down and I read through the first 200 pages very fast. I thought the book actually lost it's intensity near the end. I was expecting a better finish to it all. Overall, a good book. I still don't think that Koontz books can compare to King's but are enjoyable none the less."
1,Skip This Book,"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, however, I was terribly dissapointed with this novel. Koontz did not take the time to develop his characters effectively, rendering most of the character decisions made in the book silly and laughable. Was Mr. Koontz trying to beat a deadline???"
2,Metaphor....Metaphor...and did I say Metaphor?,"My first Koontz book. Wow. The story line popped up between zillions of metaphors....like weeds popping up through flowers that blow gently like a mother's kiss to her baby. UGH. Interesting plot - great to be in a 24 hour period during the book, but my gosh, the metaphors. Really made it hard to plod through. Disappointed."
2,There's more to good writing than intensity.,"No. Sorry. Serial killers like Mr. 'God fears me' Vess are best left to Patricia D. Cornwell and John Sandford. They have protagonists who can handle them. The ideal Dean Koontz antagonist is science-fictionized (The Bad Place, Watchers, Phantoms) and two- or three-dimensional. And the protagonist is an ordinary person (The Voice of the Night, Watchers, Midnight), not a Superwoman who breaks oak chairs and fights off guard dogs with cleaning fluid. This book was intense all right; unfortunately, that's ALL it was"
1,Don't bother!!,"The positive response to this book is so overwhelming that I must put in my two cents worth. I started to read it, I even held out hope for 100 pages, because I like Koontz. After 100 pages I found I still wasn't interested or involved in what was happening - I really didn't care about the characters or their eventual fates - and I put the book away. I felt I had better things to do with my time"
5,Beautiful lamp,the lamp was beautiful and arrived in perfect condition.It was as pictured and was the enjoyment of the person who received it as his gift for Christmas.
2,Not recommended - too many negatives,On the good side:-Keeps accurate time.-Long battery life.-Reasonably loud alarm.-Easy to read in daylight.On the negative side:-Not possible to set accurate alarm - can easily miss by up to 10 minutes.-Thicker than it needs to be.-Battery cover tends to fall off in luggage. Ours is Scotch-taped on.-Alarm On/Off switch easily pushed in luggage. Ours is taped off.-CANNOT SEE WITHOUT A FLASHLIGHT AT NIGHT.-HANDS AND NUMBERS ARE NOT LUMINOUS.Braun usually does better than this. Too bad.
4,SHOULD BE CALLED SEVENTIES SOUL RELIVED !!!!!!,"THIS DVD INCLUDES AT THE BEGINNING ABOUT 5 HIT STYLISTS SONGS WHICH ALL SOUND PRETTY GOOD. I FOUND THE CHILITES HITS WERE WELL DONE, ESPECIALLY HAVE YOU SEEN HER. THE DELFONICS HIT LA,LA,LA MEANS I LOVE U WAS A LITTLE OFF, BUT THEY DID BETTER ONCE THEY WARMED UP DID A BETTTER VERSION OF DIDNT I BLOW YOUR MIND. THE FAKE HAROLD MELVIN CLOSES AT THE END WITH THEIR TWO HITS WITH HIS VERY POWERFUL VOICE. THEIR CLOTHES WERE RETRO SEVENTIES OUTFITS WHICH WAS PRETTY COOL. BUT I GOTTA SAY I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THIS DVD VOLUME #1. GLAD I GOT IT. BUT I DONT RECOMMEND VOLUMES 2 AND 3 WHICH WERE DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST. VOLUME 1 IS EXCELLENT.THE DINOSAUR DANCE MOVES WERE HILARIOUS AND A COUPLE OF THESE GUYS LOOK LIKE THERE READY TO CHECK IN TO AN OLD FOLKS HOME"
5,Perfect,I ordered this box for a birthday present and when it arrived I was so excited. It is exactly as it is shown. I purchased a tiny angel and placed it in the box to give to my cousin.To respond to the negative feedback regarding the size of the box: this is labeled as a keepsake box and the dimensions are given in the description. I don't believe that it is fair to give the item a negative review when YOU are the one that did not read the description and did not understand what a keepsake box is.
1,Worthless piece of hardware.,"This computer has been back to HP 3 times for a broken wireless card and a messed up screen that blacks in and out. Luckily it was still under warranty, however the headache I went through spending hours on the phone with customer service in a another country, and waiting days on end for a manager to call back was not worth it. It was ""fixed"" and worked for another 6 months, but now the wireless card is not working again, and what do you know, the screen turns itself off and will not come back on until I do a hard reset and shut it down by the power button. I hate this computer, and HP."
1,Don't make a mistake by purchasing HP,"I have the Pavilion dv6000 Entertainment PC. Don't be fooled by this computer's sleek look. I have made numerous calls, been on hold, hung up on, and struggled with a language barrier (someone from India was ""helping"" me) and finally just gave up. HP's idea of customer service is to ignore you until you go away. It works! Great tactic! This company is not interested in selling quality products or providing basic support services. The laptop speakers have not worked since I plugged in external speakers. Now the external speaker port is screwed up and only plays sound on one side of the speakers or headphones. So much for an ""entertainment"" pc. The CD Player rarely works, won't eject CD's, and randomly turns on and off by itself. The wireless controller doesn't work PERIOD. The only good thing I can say about it is that it's PRETTY... and we all know.. pretty just doesn't cut it anymore. I won't purchase another HP again."
3,Didn't ship as advertised,"My laptop was advertised as having Windows Vista Ultimate, but arrivedwith Windows Vista Premium. I'm waiting to see what Amazon and Elecsurf.com will do."
2,fiction,"If you assume this is fiction that might help. The detail in the book is rather rich, so it does have a way of involving one. I liked some of the characters but I didn't feel anything of worth was coming from the endless stories. No wisdom, no meaning.While this book tells different sort of stories than Carlos' books do the tone is very similar if not the same.I can't recommend it as I feel no wiser for having read it.Make up your own mind of course but perhaps it would be wise to read this article too:[...]"
2,Wow...,"Okay, I admit I got this to add to my evergrowing Feldman collection. But if there's ever a movie that has you wondering what the hell is going in from title to end credits...this'd be it! Thought it'd at least have the ability to follow some kind of plot. All I got was...well...a G rated baaaaaadly acted sex movie. It shall stay on my shelf for collection value...but not watch value for sure."
3,"Not good, but not completely bad.","I saw the film being a big fan of the original two. While the action scenes were very good, the storyline and plot were very weak and not up to the rest of the trilogy in my opinion. The characters were left undeveloped and while the story had so much potential, it ultimately let down by not exploring the many possibilities. Essentially it ended up feeling like a Saturday Night Live parody skit, rather than the real deal."
1,Damien Donnelly.,"I was lucky enough to get a decent copy of this movie before it came out in the cinema.I have to say i was a bit of a letdown,the story was weak but the action was good,i also have to say the movie wasn't long enough,T2 was over 2 hours long this movie wasonly 1 hour and 40 minutes.If james cameron had directed it it would have been a smash like T2."
2,What a turkey....,"I'd heard this one was bad, but I wanted to see some explosions and and car chases. If that's all you want, this movie is worth seeing, otherwise, forget it. The script stinks, filled with stupid throwbacks to the previous movies and silly situations. The acting stinks (if anything, Arnold's gotten worse since T2, and he's certainly looking older. Do Terminator's really age?). The characters are inane (who really cares about these versions of the characters). The worst thing is that this movies isn't even bad in a good way. Some movies are so bad you can laugh at them. This one, sorry, it's not even funny. Just kinda dull.The interesting stuff in this series has already been said. Go watch T2 again. Leave this turkey on the shelf where it belongs."
3,It's Worth Watching and Possibly Buying,"The truth is that this is not a bad movie, but it isn't really a great movie either. The script could have been better, but it did bring up some interesting questions. John Connor and Katherine Brewster's relationship could have been a lot more involved, but at least the writers didn't have them go too far and have a sex scene. Sure the Terminator wasn't as cool in this one as in the others, but come on Arnold is getting old. There is a lot of stuff like that in the movie, but the action is cool and you've got to give it that. I don't think that movies should be judged by how much action there is, but it works for a movie like this. So, basically it isn't as good as the first two by a long shot, but it's okay. And if you're like me and you love the first two and feel like you need to buy it so that you can complete the trilogy feel free to. You won't watch it as much as you do the other two, but you might just watch a few times a year."
2,"Worth seeing, however....","The first one was ground breaking and put Arnold in the perfect role. It was worth seeing again and again. The second one took a risk, and it paid off big. Great flick.Then somebody had to push it. It's not that this movie wasn't entertaining and doesn't have some great special effects, but it just doesn't work. It doesn't flow. It was a big let down from the previous two films.Is it worth owning? I guess for those that are totally into the series it is. I'm not in a big hurry to even see the film again, which is a shame, because the first two were so well done. A mild recommendation."
5,ITS SPECTACULAR,"I thought it would stink, I was very wrong.t3 is just as good as the original and close to the 2nd.third chapters in movies mostly [are bad],but not this one.The action never stops and it actually ends on a dark note like the others."
4,Not to bad.,It is a pretty decent movie & doesn't necessarily have some of the action or graphics that the first two did. It is supposed to be science fiction within our own time era. Since when can a multi wheeled crane as wide as 2 lanes of traffic travel at 50 mph with the boom & stabilizers out sideways?
2,"This movie is a flop, but good special effects.","Its another plottless movie, bad guys chases good guy, they fight and someone wins. Special effcts do rock in this movie.I hate to say this, but everyone dies at the end. The killer is really Elmo from Seasme Street. He traveled through time to kill everyone so big bird and burt & ernie could run the mob. awesomespecial effects. I would say ""a must see movie."""
2,Horrible re-hash of T2,"I was really excited to finally sit down and watch this as I always enjoyed the first two Terminator movies. So this is not a review from someone who hates cheesy unrealistic sci fi or action films.I was really disappointed by the:1) Plot2) Script3) Acting4) PaceThere were some cool special effects and a hilarious chase scene, but overall the movie is terrible! Its worth watching if you were a Terminator fan, but don't get your hopes up that it will add anything significant to the previous two stories. It would have been interesting to go forward into the future and focus on the wars against the machines."
3,Very entertaining - great FX,"OK, I won't include any jokes about California. Though the futuristic concept is getting tired, the special effects still shine through. www.jafguitar.com"
2,"Rise of the Machines, Fall of the Series","If you enjoyed T1 & T2 then just wait there is still time for you to be disappointed. T3 could not be more so. It falls short completely on story line. Compaired to T2 it falls way short on special effects. Rise of the Machines, Fall of the Series!"
4,Better than expected,"I've set my standards a little lower for Terminator 3. After all, it's not a James Cameron film. But boy, was I surprised upon viewing the DVD (and watching it after the first two). It finishes the Terminator trilogy quite neatly with its logical and satisfying conclusion. The movie moves briskly, there are no boring moments, kudos to Jonathan Mostow whose quick pacing has been honed in equally watchable movies like U-571 and Breakdown. Get this disc for the jaw-dropping chase scene across downtown L.A. involving a crane, fire truck, police vehicles and a pick-up. Simply spectacular! Finding out how they did it in through the commentary is worth the retail price. The other disc is okay to have, but doesn't contribute much to the story or the Terminator mythology."
2,T3 the terminator of Arnold's career,"I saw the movie over the weekend and I am a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie did have great stunts, special effects and explosions. But the movie did not have much of a story line to go with it. The poor plot of the movie did not link well with what the original movie and T2 set as the foundation for the series. Arnold has not made much of an impact at the movies lately and this T3 basically looks like a career-ending move for him."
4,"Better than the original, didn't top the second.","Teminator 3: Rise of the Machines is to the most climatic point that u could get in the TerminaTOR seris. The thing that I didnt like about it was that the morals completly changed. The moral of t1 was: ""U can choose ur destiny."" And in t2 they kept repeating ""No fate, but what we make for ourselves."" But now they tryed to bring out ""U can't escape ur destiny."" Personally, I donm't beilve in fate, but I beilve that everything happens for a reason.., Anyway,, I dont wanna find enlightenment, all I'm saying is that they need to stick with a common moral..But It really was quite entertainig.Lots of ction and plot galore."
2,Rent Terminator 2,If your looking for the best Terminator movie turn to the Second one its still the best. The effects in the 3rd mabey updated and well done but the intesity and story are the best thought out and done in the second
1,awful,"Why. WHY?! This movie joins Alien Resurrection and Jurassic Park 3 as movies that took a good idea, ran way too long, and ended up stupid. this had so much potential and it just died. We sat in the theater laughing because this is histerical, but it wasn't supposed to be. The ""funny"" parts were boring and the serious part cracked me up. Gotta say though, that the part where she locks him in a dog cage is kinda funny, again not meant to be, but it is. Oh, and why would they pick Claire Danes for this? She did nothing but scream throughout the whole thing, the relevation regarding her in the future was seen a mile away, and where was Linda Hamilton? I'll tell you; she probably took one look at the script and wisely said hells no. So easy solution, we kill her off.So sad. go watch the frist two, forget yuo ever saw this one, and enjoy your Terminator world where there is a possibility of a happy future.Terminatrix was hot though..."
1,Please Don't Make Anymore,"Terminator 1 = THE BEST MOVIE EVER!Terminator 2 = Okay, it's pretty goodTerminator 3 = Are you sure this isn't a parody?"
2,Not Impressed,"I have to say that after waiting for many years for the third installment of the Terminator series, that this movie was a big disappointment. The acting was marginal and the characters didn't even seem likable. Claire Danes was very annoying throughout the movie, and I think they could have picked someone better. Arnold did good, but I really didn't care for Terminator X. She was just plain boring. Nothing really stuck out in the movie. I hated how the movie ended only because I felt like nothing was accomplished from the beginning to the end. This one was a big let down."
1,THE WORSE TERMINATOR MOVIE EVER MADE,"The movie is so cheezeee.... the action is so phony, the guy who plays John Conner sucks, in T2 the kid was cool in this one he's a big dork. So much money put into this crappy movie, it's a one big joke if you a ask me. Whatever ever happend to the cop that pulled over the evil robot chick, all the sudden they decided not to show that part. The huge truck was alreayd parked next to the animal hospital to be driven on little street and destory everything in it's way...oh please....THE MOVIE PLAIN SUCKS...T2 is still the best Terminator MOVIE. period"
4,Terminator rocks,"Ok so this isn't as good as t1 or t2, but so what this movie is very exciting from end to finish and I can't wait to view it in dvd...I hope t4 will be made because this movie leaves open ground for another sequel. Although I don't think it will be the same without Arnold."
3,Does not compare to T2,"Ok movie, made me miss T2Whole movie was a little sillyBetter than T1Would not watch again ."
2,IT IS JUST A CHEAP COPY OF TERMINATOR 2!!!,"not good, it's just a cheap copy of the awesomeTERMINATOR 2, judgement day.the car-chases, the speach... and the scenes are all likeTHE ""TERMINATOR 2'S""INSTAID I RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THE SPECIAL EDITION OF TERMINATOR 2, It is worth the price i tell you, do not buy this movie it is waste of money."
2,Full of holes,"I bought this just to have all three. James Cameron set the benchmark which has never been exceeded in sci-fi with Aliens, and T2 and T1 we're very well done too. This was made without the eye for detail and plot consistancy one unfortunately expects with the bulk of todays movies, and this one is no exception."
3,Could have been a 30-minute movie,"Frankly, I am surprised by all of the 4s and 5s that were given. I liked T1 and T2, and this one had an interesting plot, BUT the story line was about 15 minutes long and the action could/should have been condensed to 15 minutes, too. Some of the effects were cool, but the fight scenes were way too drawn out. Even my husband, a Terminator fan club member, was disappointed. Wait for the video. I still give it 3 because it has T1 and T2 (and T4?) to redeem it."
2,so overdone that it was bad,this movie went into the wrong direction from the first five minutes. unlike the legendary t2 . t3 in my opinion had horrible and excessive oneliners that make a 2 year old smart. the acting was horrible with the exception of shwarzenegger. the personalities of haracters in t2 such as john connor seem to be forgotten and the characters seem to be running in circles with out any thought. what made t2 so great was the dark atmosphere which appeared only once in t3 and i will not give away any spoilers. the director made a bad choice by not following james camerons style and it learly shows. also many of the action scenes are pointless and don't have th flow that t2 had.it was just action scene after action scene with no real story to go between it.
3,I've read this one too,"The author of this book spends all his time detailing the problem without a single keystroke of solution. Is there a book out there that realy turns the advantage back to parents and Internet users? The only book I like is ""Life and Death on the Internet"" by Keith A. Schroeder. At least two-thirds of Life and Death is solutions. Who cares about the problem. We all know it exists, just open a newspaper. I would pass on this book. Life and Death on the Internet is better."
3,ok,"condition of the book was good - book was used as the former owner wrote throughout the book. They also ""flagged"" many pages with yellow sticky notes. Therefore, I give it 3-stars. However, I still feel it was worth the cost."
2,A surprisingly uninteresting drawing book...,As expected the book covers a very large spectrum of drawing techniques but in a relatively shallow way. I felt as if I had seen most of this material before in other books. Good only for those with little or no drawing experience who need a general overview of techniques.
5,refreshing fairytale,"A good fairytale, with a feminist twist.A King offers the hand of his magnificent daughter to any suitor who can wrestle as well as she, and asks one hundred horses of every man who is thrown from the ringSadly an underappreciated aad rare book. Worth seeking out."
4,Time Changer?,"If you're looking for science fiction or a good time-travel movie, this movie's not for you. This is really a drama which as a matter of necessity incorporates a time machine. It is mildly entertaining, often humorous, but primarily it serves to challenge present concepts of societal normality by providing a glimpse of what was considered normal for society until about the 1920s."
5,Time Changer,"Excellent story! Thought provoker! I trust Christ is your Savior! Jn. 3:16 ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten SOn, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life."""
1,This is not a film,"At best this is a poorly made commercial for some sort of evangelical Christian sect. (Being a Jew, I find it appaling that any religion could hold that the only path to salvation is through some arbitrary acceptance of some mythical figure. All the Jews, Muslims, and Hindus are doomed to eternal fire becaue they do not accept Jesus, whatever that means. The film does not define the process of acceptance. The idea of somebody dying for somebody else's sins is so alien to Judaism, that I find it silly.) This hokey film is trying and failing to prove that without ""accepting"" Jesus man is doomed to a state of some immoral anarchy. The plot, the acting, the special effects are on the level of Japanese kiddie SciFi flicks of the 1950s. Enough said."
3,"A entertaining movie for the family, but not great.","It's ok, but not the best Christian movie I've seen. The time traveling was good & today's generation should be more respectful & obediant to their elders; they should watch this.Recommends: 'Road To Redemption', 'The Gospel of John', & 'Something To Sing About'."
5,Thr Time Changer,"Time ChangerGavin MacLeod was wonderful and played a believable character in the movie. His committment to the truth is refreshing and appreciated in a world where the mindset seems to be whatever feels good, do it. If it's right for the individual, then it's right. God does set the ultimate standard for what is right snd what is wrong. We need to pay attention! Thanks to Rich Christiano for writing, producing and directing something fit to watch!"
4,"The acting could be better, but it is an important message","I have used this movie to show my children the double standards in today's society. The movie points out that although curse words are common place in modern society(freedom of speech), the name of God used in any positive way is no longer acceptable.It is also sad to see in the film, the state of many churches of today (thankfully, not all). The acting could be better, but considering the film's budget, they did great."
4,This is NOT Hokey Christian stuff!,This is an interesting an enthralling movieAlthough ths movie may seem out of this world the morals in this movie are remarkably true and actuallly related to time today. Today we have gotten away from the church and say 'I ain't got no time for no church' but we should really think about spending time with God and fellow church members. This movie shows that we should not stray away from the church and from God. You should go see Time Changer. The message and the impact is very forceful in the spiritual rilm. Go see Time Changer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Drek,"I exited watching the flick a little over half-way through, having figured out I'd been decieved into a Fundamentalist propaganda meeting. Deception being a bad thing, by the way.What struck me is the amount of falsehood presented as fact in the movie and the amount of hypocracy it took to create it. Not only would the science involved with time travel have been shelved by a Fundamentalist ""scientist"" because it would involve things such as accepting the ancient age of the earth, but the claims of the religious nature of the start of this country are patently obvious to anyone who has actually sat down and *read* our Constitution.Apparently it is OK to use technology which invalidates the belief in the inerrancy of the book (like time-travel or the movie industry itself) to promote the inerrancy of the book.Hypocritic, propagandic, deceptive drivel.The flash of time-travel was pretty, though.Too bad one can't give it 0 stars."
5,Fresh perspective everyday,"No matter how many times I've read a particular daily meditation, every reading brings a new understanding of the spiritual principle being discussed. This book encourages new layers of recovery year after year. I'm grateful so many people came together to share a new way to live, one day at a time. I've also been told that if you read the entire chapter in the Basic Text that the day's subject quote comes from you'll read the entire Basic Text in a year."
1,"To ""cheap"" what i needed",The material was very cheap and it might as well of been 300 ply because there was so much space between them it wasn't very useful.
2,It came defective!,I was so looking forward to watching this one and it was defective. The CD would not play. I was very disappointed and I am returning it.Susan Kaylor
5,Finding Nemo,Got this as a gift and my girlfriend loved it. Decent movie even though I'm not into Disney movies.
5,movie purchase,this one is not just for the kids all the adults in my household love nemo and company
4,Don't buy it for the 3D,"This is a great story, but the 3D conversion is disappointing. The 3D in Disney's Tangled is vastly superior, because it was created as 3D from the beginning."
5,Great Pixar Stuff,I love the Pixar animation. It's so much more fun than cartoons for adults to watch. This movie has a great message for kids and a seperate message for parents.Our kids range in age from 1 to 10 and all of us can sit down and enjoy this movie together.
5,"Very, very funny","My mom bought this for my 2,4,& 10 yr old. It is the one movie that they can agree on. It is also very funny for adults, but be prepared! My kids now run thru the house screaming, ""mine,mine"", (ie the seagulls). But there are no dirty words or graphic scenes even in death, always a plus w kids. The supplemental stuff was lacking in my opinion, but I am big LOTR fan & used to big extras on DVD. My 10 yr old did like the info you can learn about fish, but I thought if you are going to add deleted scenes, then animate them."
5,THE BEST PIXAR MOVIE EVER!!,hey they really over did there selves. i mean it is my favourate movie now and i came to see if can preorder it now cuz i want it on dvd as soon as it comes out!! i am 12 and i went with my mom and lil bro and lil sis to watch this and i mean it is really the best movie ever to go and see!! if u didnt see it yet u have to go NOW !! I LOVE IT !!
5,An Unforgettable Classic,"This movie is so good that in my opinion it ranks up amoung animated classics such as The Lion King, Beauty and The Beast, and Cinderella it will leave you with a huge smile on your face for as many times as you see it"
5,LOVE this movie!,I bought this for my 2 year old great nephew. He is going to LOVE this movie and all the characters in it. I can't wait to watch him watch it!!!!
4,"Smart, witty, and funny.","Finding Nemo is the perfect summer film for the family. It's not raunchy at all. Sure there is a little kid humor, but then again this is made for the kids. There are smart jokes and just plain funny jokes. It should appeal to everyone. It's a 4 star flick that should been seen with the family."
2,Finding Nemo,"This DVD was delivered. It had some skipping in the beginning, but they kept them anyway. It could still be shown to the grand-kids. I also enjoyed seeing the DVD."
2,not very good,it was not a very good film the ending at the dentist ofice was great but nothing else intrested me
5,Loved this movie,"People often enjoy movies the first time they see it, but lose interest by the second, third, or fourth times. I've seen Finding Nemo 4 times, and I've enjoyed it each time. The plot is originial, the jokes are fresh, and the movie is lighthearted enough for little kids to watch while still being exciting and suspenseful enough to catch an adult's attention. The Toy Story series was pretty good, but this movie is great."
5,"'Finding Nemo' is a great family movie,.","Finding nemo is a great movie, it has fantastic charactors and has a good story line. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, it was that adventures. The charators i most ejoyed watching was the turtles they were so realistic and funny. it suited that animal.I would say this movie would be great for 6 to 14 years olds."
2,You Better Make Sure All the Disks Are Playable!,"We had this on pre-order forever. It arrived Turesday and we tried watching the 3D disk tonight. It hung/skipped from 1:00 until 1:07. We have returned the movie to Amazon and are having it replaced. I saw another person on a different site complaining about the same problem on the DVD disk. Very disappointed in Disney trying to save a few pennies at the customers expense. Typical America business pratice today. As far as the 3D portion, it was good to watch the movie again after such a long time but I expected more our of Disney for the 3D portion. I want items to pop out of the screen and very few times did that happen. If you do not own Nemo and want to buy it though I would recommend buying the 3D version over the reguler version. BUT, make sure and play all the disks to make sure there are no bad spots on them."
1,Very disappointed,I didn't know there were different series I got a DVD that was released in another country and it won't play
1,Poor streaming quality,My 3-yr old son often asks to watch movies from Amazon instant video but the result is always frustrating: chopped video and interruptions.
2,Kind of Scary and Predictable,"At the beginning of the film, a barracuda devours Nemo's mother and all his siblings. Only his father and the unhatched Nemo are left. The deaths are not shown, but the great emptiness afterward is. More scares follow, as Nemo ventures off the safe reef and is scooped up by a huge scuba diver looming like a cliff.Supporting characters are more annoying than funny. The end is completely predictable."
3,transmission problems,"love the movie, but it kept skipping and cute the end off...the last scene was gone all together- just kept saying 'loading' for 10 minutes before I switched to TV"
3,sad but happy,Findig nmo is very very sad. findig nmo is also very happy!I like finding nemo very very much!
4,Funny and sweet (but can be scary too!),"Great story for parents about letting your children go to experience life, success, failure on their own. My 6-yr-old was quite scared during several scenes...but he is pretty sensitive. Funny too!"
1,DVD was damaged,"I was looking forward to watching this great movie with my daughter, but the DVD was damaged. We could only see parts of it."
5,A wonderful Film.,"This is a movie about a fish that gets lost and kidnapped and his father adventure to find him, while Nemo (the lost kidnapped fish) tries to escape as well. It's a great movie...funny, great graphics and an all together great film. Totally recommend."
5,surprised,I went to the movies with my little cousin to see finding nemo and i expecting it to be like a regular cartoon but it was unbelievable good.
4,Pixar is now 5 for 5,"Pixar has a flawless track record in terms of putting out quality stories for any age. Their stories contain a perfect blend of tragedy and comedy, adventure and drama. Every character in Finding Nemo has a want, a need, and a past. There isn't a character in the movie that seems like a puppet for a plot. My favorite character of the film is Dory voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. Where in so many other films the sidekick is used just for an occasional laugh, Dory has perhaps the most emotional and heartbreaking scene of the film.The animation is amazing. With each film Pixar sets the bar higher.Is this movie perfect? No, in fact it's not even my favorite Pixar movie (which is Monster's Inc.). In selected scenes it gets a little too overdramatic, but this is just nitpicking. Finding Nemo is definately one of the three best movies of the year."
1,Finding the Tylenol,"I had never seen this movie when it was out in theaters and my wife and I usually buy every Disney movie that comes out on DVD, so we bought it thinking it would be another cute entertaining movie like the rest. Oh boy were we wrong.I cannot tell you how incredibly boring this movie was. I am normally a big Albert Brooks fan but his character voice over was annoying. I fully anticipated Ellen's voice over to be annoying (she is annoying in real life). Every time she spoke I wanted some painkillers to ease the pain of the incredible headache it gave me (especially the whale imitation scene, yikes!)The story was lacking, I didn't care about the characters. I was ready for the shark to come along and eat them all so the movie would be over.Well, just like with Lord of the Rings, I am but one of about 10 people in the world that thought this movie was horrible. No shame in that, I actually like movies that have an engaging plot and interesting characters. Funny me I guess."
2,Too American,"I, Robby Genepri, have languished long and hard while critiquing this film through and through for any revolting gratuitous cartoon violence. After finding little to boot, I must admit that I am still taken aback by the sheer audacity of Disney to release a cartoon film that encourages fish to fend for themselves. I feel it incumbent upon the cartoon industry to underscore the increasing importance of interdependence, or collectivism, if you will. Nemo, in his despicable American individualism, sours the taste in my Marxist socialist palate."
5,Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),"Life along the Great Barrier Reef is full of dangers when you are a tiny clown fish. And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. An engaging undersea story that your kids will find cool. A treat for everyone."
5,colorful,Watching this in 3D is awesome. Everything is just more alive. Once you see movies in the 3D mode I don't believe you will want to watch them regular again.
5,Perfect for adults and children,A great movie to watch with your kids or by yourself. This movie is too cute and has parts that will appeal to adults as well as children. The special effects are extreamely well done and the scenery created is wonderful. The characters have great and distinct personalities. Right from the start you will be drawn into the movie. A wonderful film.
5,The greatest movie,"Finding Nemo is my favorite movie and i am 14 years old. It has a great, funny, heart warming plot and all the characters add so much to the movie. This movie is great for all ages because my friends daughter at 2 loved it, my sisters at 8 and 5 love it, i am 14, my mother is 42, my best friend is 11, and my aunt is 65. We all enjoy watching it and collecing the memrobilia from the movie. I hope that this review was helpful in letting you know that this movie is for all ages and that the spirt of the movie makes you laugh everytime!"
4,"Good, but it could've been better","I thought this movie was a very fun movie to watch plus it had great animated special effects. I just didn't think it was as good as some other movies that Pixar had done in the past like Monsters Inc. or Toy Story 2. Mainly because there wasn't as much humor in this movie as some other animated movies that I've seen. Some of the scenes in this movie were funny, but not many. Also I'm not a really big fan of Albert Brooks or Ellen DeGeneres. But if your looking for a movie that is good for the youngsters to see, this is a good one."
2,Way too expensive,"This is whats wrong with movies today. $33 dollars for a movie! Who buys a Blu ray and then says ""Gee I hope this comes with a low resolution DVD version too, or I am not buying it."" All I want is the 3D version because I already bought the Blu ray disc but instead, I'm gonna be forced to pay for a DVD I don't want, a 2D disc I don't want, and a digital download that I don't want. People wonder why piracy is rampant, well this is why."
5,Great Movie,I saw this 3 times with my granddaughter she loves itand actually so do Iyou have got to see it
4,Muddy Rivers,"This is a pretty good collection of Johnny Rivers' hits, but it is by no means definitive. Notable hits that are missing include ""Under Your Spell Again"", ""Muddy River"", ""Help Me Rhonda"", ""Swayin' to the Music"" and ""Curious Mind"". But if you can find a cheap used copy of this CD, it may be worth picking up."
2,Pompous and nonsensical.,"This book is presented as a conversation between two poets, but really it's an excuse for Allen Grossman to talk. His tone is condescending and patronizing toward both Halliday and the reader, which instantly makes you dislike the book. Beyond that, the insights that are in the book are vague, not well argued/supported and very abstract. This book does not open you to thinking about poetry, but rather attempts to lecture you on a single viewpoint that's incomprehensible. Save your money and read poets that actually matter."
3,"Good, but...","I agree with the second reviewer of this book who reviewed it in 1999 and which I quote following this sentence. ""Weiss fails to place the concept of evaluation within a larger theoretical framework. Her book contains a short discussion of the political legislation that triggered the growth of evaluation science, but it does not outline the assumptions or the alternatives behind the legislation. Evaluation is best used as a reference for clarification on particular evaluation research issues, and not as a text from which to understand the implicit assumptions of evaluation science."" I agree particularly with the reviewer's last statement that EVALUATION is best used a reference book, and that's how I will use it in the future."
4,"great printer for price, small bugs","Printer works great, warms up quickly, prints fast and double sided printing's amazingly fast and reliable. its network printing allows me to print without pluging in my laptop and the printer is tucked away out of sight (though its a bit big...). only complaint is when printing with the mac os, not sure why, but i can't seem to alter the print settings in the print menu like i can on a pc over the web based settings. but its great price overcomes any of its small bugs."
5,Yet another winner,"This is the second Brother printer that I've owned. The other is a few years old, an HL-5170DN with much the same featureset.I haven't put the HL-5250DN through all that much, but I have been printing like crazy. I'm required to read a lot of technical papers, and they're much easier to read on paper than screen. I've printed hundreds of pages, almost all duplexed, and *one* has come out wrong, and that's because I tried to print a PDF inside a browser using the browser's print dialog rather than the Acrobat plugin's print dialog. Excluding that one mistake on my part, everything has come out quickly and perfectly.For anyone wanting a printer, I highly suggest going with a Brother laser printer. They're nicely priced (especially if you can find one refurbished) and very reliable."
3,Where's the Battery?,Hello all .... Everything is great about this phone.EXCEPT THE BATTERY. One 15 min. call and it is dead.Any ideas from Linksys? Please advise. Thank you.wtkeller
3,Good WiFi phone over all!,This is a good phone. The only thing I have noticed is that the signal has to be pretty strong or the phone won't connect. I wish you could IM with the phone since it is Skype.
2,Linksys WIP320 iPhone falls short,"The product description in January 2007 is inaccurate:batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours, not 60;there is no hands free speakerphone;if you use a standard plug-in headset, the microphone does not work (tested two units).There is more:the headset is very loud (you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear), but there is no volume adjustment;the microphone has low sensitivity, so you find yourself yelling into it;the clock resets itself when the power is turned off.I returned mine."
1,"No Speakerphone, False Advertising","For a phone that costs $169, the lack of any features is pretty disturbing. But the one that Linksys actually points out in their documentation is actually not available on this phone. That feature would be a speakerphone, a mainstay of about every phone sold today. The phone works, but the speaker is apparently only to play the startup noise.Also, it feels pretty cheap when using it. I was afraid I was going to break a button. This one went right back to Amazon."
3,Battery Life is Low,"This phone is nice. The setup is really nice and easy too. However, the battery life is extremely low. I get less than two hours talk time. I have to keep it plugged in at all time just to make sure I can receive calls."
3,"ok phone, but with issues","when the phone works it is great. clear, loud sound, etc. however there are quite a few times when you can't connect on the first try, sometimes a reboot is required. also the battery standby time is pretty short.has one disadvantage over the phones that have base (like this one:Netgear Dual Mode Cordless Phone with Skype), it has no way for you to pre-set your location, so that means you always have to dial + (or really 00), then area code, then the number. i wish there was a way to set a default location.tried other linksys skype phones and one from netgear, with all the faults of this phone it still beats them."
2,Nice but wouldn't buy it again...,"The Linksys WIP320 offers good sound quality but:- Battery weak; lasts an hour in speaking, you have to charge it always during standby to make sure you have enough power when a call comes in.- Had several situations where the phone made a reset by itself or didn't reacted anymore (so the battery had to be removed, then it would restart).- Can't join wireless networks which require authentication- offers just a few ringtones to choose from and they all sound horrible. There's also no way to load additional ringtones via the USB port- Somewhere ""speakerphone"" was mentioned... well, not that I ever managed to get that working.- Headset port doesn't work with every 2.5 plug headset."
1,Forgive me,"I feel bad about saying this. Mr. Burke failed terribly with this book (In the Moon of Red Ponies). I don't know what happened with his writing, or did he write this way on purpose? Got me. All I know is I found myself skipping paragraph after paragraph after paragrapph. Nearing the end of the book, I actually begin skipping whole pages.I've previously enjoyed his work and always was happy to find a new release of Mr. Burke's. This one was a waste of time, his and mine."
3,Not up to his previous work,"Although this book is beautifully written with lyric prose and photographic imagery, the plot left me baffled. Billy Bob and his family were usually so far from the center of action, their presence seemed little more than an artifice to tie subplots and characters together; their actions never justified the perils that engulfed them. The secondary characters were for the most part well drawn and compelling, but even they were not consistently well-motivated. Three stars for style, not for story."
2,A big disappointment,"James Lee Burke's thrillers, whether they revolve around Dave Robicheaux or Billy Bob Holland, are written to an unvarying formula: a tightly-wound hero convinced of his own morality encounters flawed and self-destructive people from his past who involve him in a struggle with evil forces. Though the hero attempts to ward off trouble by self-righteous rudeness to all around him, he is inevitably drawn into the vortex that leads to a deadly redemption for the figure from the past and a dose of rueful wisdom for our hero. Though this formula has worked for him before, Burke goes to the well once too often in his latest novel.""In the Moon of Red Ponies"" was clearly written in some haste with little concern for plot. The author's anger at politicians and corporations makes this effort more like an eco-terrorist's recruitment tract than a novel that cres about its readers. Pity."
1,Formulaic BS,"I've read several of the earlier Robicheaux novels, and liked them. Sorry, Mr. Burke, but it seems you've degenerated into turning out pap to pay for your ranch in Montana.Poorly developed and unbelievable characters, overloaded with trite prose about the Montana scenery and Indian/Christian hokum. I'm disappointed, sir."
3,Excellent guide!,This book is an excellent guide to begin making projects in Dreamweaver. Easy step by step instructions. Anyone can use this computer program if they follow this book!
3,"No CD from Warehouse Deals, Inc","I eagerly opened mine, which I ordered from Warehouse Deals, Inc here on Amazon, looked in the setup guide, and the first thing it said to do was insert the installation CD. I looked through what came in the box over and over and over, but there was no such thing. What am I supposed to do? Judging by the other reviews I am sure this product is amazing and wonderful, but, thanks to Warehouse Deals, Inc, I may never know."
1,Horrible do not purchase,"I recently purchased this DVD huge mistake. Not only are the characters annoying and often seem under the influence of drugs, there is also very little in the way of actual yoga. To make it even worse the packaging states the Approx. running time of the DVD is 35 minutes but it actually only lasts about 15 minutes. Terrible, Terrible, terrible, sums it all up!"
2,Only for the Celtic of heart,"I ordered this knowing it was a chance, not being able to listen to any samples. If I had been able to preview I wouldn't have ordered it. This ensemble isn't without quality or style, just not for the non-Celtic of heart. I'll be donating this to my local public library."
4,Small Doggie,"I somehow thought this engagement calendar would be a bit larger, but it is quite small, which I like since it fits in all of my purses... It has lots of space for writing stuff in, including notes sections and a special dates to remember page for every divider.The only thing I dont like was that apart from the front and back covers Doggie pictures, it only has SIX more dog pictures inside which also work as two month dividers. The breeds featured are: Golden Retriever puppy, West Highland White Terrier, German Sheperd puppy, Beagle, Wire Hair Daschund and finally 2 Jack Russell Terrier puppies.It is very handy and it covers my needs, but if you are looking for pictures... this one isnt for you!!"
2,Tough to install and parts fell off,"I have installed several sway bars of other manufacturers on similar vehicles, I have my own shop. This one while much cheaper in price was much harder to install with drilling the frame, and with in 3 months one of the mounting brackets on axle fell off, I even used my torque wrench to follow instructions. Spend more and get a better one. It did improve handling until it fell off."
4,Molly Moon Review,"The book was interesting because there was so much suspension i didn't want to put it down. It was also a good book because there was a lesson woven into it like most great books. There was an evil villan that had the dreams of a crook, and a girl from a harsh and unloving orphanage, to discovering this book and having a whole new world opening up to her!"
2,Molly Moon,"Molly Moons Incredible Book of Hypnotism is a book that would proubably be enjoyed most by readers ages 7-10. This book is for someone who doesn't mind a longer book and is able to wait until the really good part. The protagonist (Molly Moon) is just your typical orphan girl that happened upon a magnificent book. A book that could get her anything she wants. The antagonist (Dr.Nockman) is a hard-headed crook trying to get his way to the top not only through Molly, but also that wonderful book. This book is something that I didn't enjoy all that much. I'm not someone that enjoys waiting quite a while for the climax. But overall it was a pretty good book."
5,I love your books,"I am Andrew and I love your books, they pull me right into them.I love how everyone is descibed,I also love what Molly does with the incredible book of hypnotism.From andrewmy nickname is TJI'm from Brigham Utah"
2,Huge disappointment compared to the 2005 edition !,I saw the 2005 edition of this guide at one of the colleges we visited and really liked it. So I bought it. However the new 2007 edition is so much tamer and more politically correct than the earlier one that it is much more boring and much less helpful than the 2005 version. The student comments have been totally watered down and the star ratings are gone.Bottom line: you're much better off getting your hands on a used copy of the 2005 edition (which is called The best 357 Colleges).
5,Koos Couture Collage: Inspiration & Techniques,"Hello,The book arrived on time in excellent condition. As a matter of fact this book is one of my favorite reference books still today. It was a pleasure doing business with you.Thank you again.Respectfully yours,"
4,superb photography and casting .,"FugitivasYou should watch this movie at least once. If you can't rent it, buy it."
3,Good - somewhat awkward,"This CD includes some of Mozart's most sublime work. Like most compilations, each piece on the CD exists out of context, which sometimes feels awkward. Also, some of the performances are not up-to-snuff. In particular, the flute and harp concerto (K.299) is clunky and strangely juxtiposed with an outstanding performance of the K.622 clarinet concerto. I was also a bit disappointed with the metronomic performance of the K.361 adagio, which is among my favorite pieces of music. This CD is outstanding as background music - it's simply lovely, but it's not particularly good listening for the serious Mozart fan."
5,Great book!!,"My son has had this dinosaur book/card leap pad for about 4 years. He is now 8 and still plays with it. Has of yet to loose a single card. Our grandchildren also play with it and they are 14, 11, 9, and 7. Dinosaurs are universal. He wore out 2 electronic leap pads. Will need to pass this on to other family members when he finally decides that he has had enough!!! Just found the Leap pad 2 and 3 Dinosaurs, Hope they are just as fun!!!!"
3,Good Things Taste Bad,"I still haven't figured out how to get a goodly dose of Calcium Ascorbate past my tongue and down my throat. It's supposed to be easier on the stomach than Ascorbic Acid - but it tastes like rather bland-tasting dirt. If I live through getting this down, next time I'll get the Ascorbic Acid."
3,Maroon one is better than the blue one.,The maroon PaperPro Prodigy Stapler gets five stars; but the blue one gets only 3. I assumed both colors would work identically...but they don't. The blue one bends the staple when stapling only two sheets of paper AND it is so powerful that it feeds the point of the staple from the back onto the front of the paper. It's odd. Both the maroon and the blue look identical; but they behave quite differently. I ordered two maroons and two blues and tested all four with the same results. The maroon ones did not bend the staples and did not send the points of the staples to the front of the page while the blue ones did. I'm sending both blue ones back and keeping the maroon ones.
5,"staple away, baby!","Great stapler, especially if you have to staple large stacks of stuff on a regular basis. It's also easy to load and uses standard sized staples...The one I got was blue, white, and red (patriotic, which I didn't realize until after I'd ordered it), but the black/silver one looks spiffier.It's also very stable on it's base."
5,Innovation Never Ceases in a Free Society,"Who would have thought that you could improve on the simple office stapler? Well, some smart person who got tired of traditional office staplers jamming and not having any leverage decided to make an improvement. The Paper Pro is quite an improvement! It uses simple mechanical advantage that should have been thought of 80 years ago. Great device !"
5,Highly Recommended,"Staples are bad for scanners (when you have a paperless office), but when you must use a stapler these are AWESOME! A little loud, but definitely low impact. I'm under 30, so I'm hoping using this will help minimize damage to my joints & prevent carpal tunnel."
4,1989 was a pop/dance music lover's dream year,"I consider nineteen eighty-nine to be the American music industry's last hurrah in terms of popular music. A string of solid pop records (when they actually *were* records!) were released that year that have, in my opinion, stood the test of time and continue to bring a smile to my face everytime I hear them. The Cover Girls' ""We Can't Go Wrong"" is certainly no exception.I used to have this album on audio cassette tape and am looking forward to adding it to my collection again as I really enjoy the title song as well as the fun ""All That Glitters Isn't Gold"" (I did chuckle everytime I saw the video on MTV), the upbeat ""My Heart Skips a Beat"" as well as the fun ""Up on the Roof"" and the equally fun and upbeat ""Cute.""In all, ""We Can't Go Wrong"" is one of those rare pop albums that I can leave running from beginning to end and not have to fast forward to skip through songs. - Donna Di Giacomo"
1,What Happenned To Carole King??,"this collection is one of the worst (and, frankly, most embarrassing)of Carole's releases. I thought ""Simple Things"" was a departure from her previous artistic integrity, but, ""City Streets"" sunk Carole to a new low. Overly synthesized, bad writing, and bad arrangements. Carole should have retired after ""Thoroughbred"". It was her last well produced and listenable album. Only redeeming song here is ""Homeless Heart"", and it's heatbreaking to hear, being remembrance of what Carole King once was."
2,"20 Hooks, Not 32","Be aware that even though these are better quality than most for sale (1/4"" and not 1/8""), the description language is somewhat deceptive. Yes, there are 32 ""pieces"", but 12 of those pieces are spacers and screws, which most people don't want or don't need. We just want good quality pegboard hooks at a low price.So be aware that if you buy this set, you will be getting a higher quality hook than most sets, but you'll only be getting 20 hooks, not 32."
4,great order,I like the book was cheap and I can use this book for life. It was in great condition and there was no marking inside the book.
2,A Typical D.W. Griffith production,"D.W. Griffith was a racist bigot to say the least. His depictions of Blacks and Hispanics in his films will make your blood boil. Unfortunatly, he was a product of his times. (May we never see their like again) If you are looking for historical accuracy, forget it. If you want to see one of the first ""Alamo"" movies, then grit your teeth while you sit through it. Only the vaguest of historical detail are present. Oddly enough, this is one of the few ""Alamo"" films to actually depict the execution of some seven Anglo survivors. (Crockett was not among them)"
1,An insult to two great jazz masters,If you prefer the outtakes and the interviews on a movie DVD then you'll love this album. If you like to hear the best of the best then forget it. This album is of no real historic or musical value.
1,Dont buy this.,"I bought this case, and within a week, the little plastic latches broke off. It was not made from very high quality plasitc, and cracked when i dropped it onto a carpeted floor. Also, dirt and grime can become trapped underneath the case, and it pitted and scratched my screen."
1,For you sanity DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this one without reading other reviews and almost lost my sanity. It would drop connection often, pulling it out and replugging it in would help sometimes, but eventually my computer refused to acknowledge it's presence. Rebooting helped, same symptoms were duplicated on my laptop as well as desktop and finally, one fine day it died (the led would not light up). This was after only 1/2 a dozen uses. Now I am back to my wired connection, I am still in shock and it would take some time to recover before I try other USB wireless adapterS!!! So buy it at your own risk AND SANITY"
2,Ok,the product is defected after one year. the trendnet company tech support is suck. they don't want to exchage it.
1,USB Adapter does not work for me.,The Trendnet 108mbps wireless adapter worked the first time after is set up the software but does not reconnect on the same computer and wireless router. The software may be the problem it is not user friendly and at this point i cannot get it to work at all. I would not recommend this product.
5,I Got the CD,If anyone need a copy let me know. I'll give it to them. It's a great cd and I don't mind sharing.
5,- SOMEONE GET THIS CD (COPY) TO ME!,I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS CD OVER 15 YEARS! IT WAS ONCE FOUND FOR ME BUT IT GOT STUCK IN AN OLD PLAYER. IF YOU HAVE THIS CD AND ARE LOOKING TO EARN YOUR WINGS IN HEAVEN PLEASE CONTACT ME. MUST I TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'D APPRECIATE IT???
1,PhotoShop Album Not Good Software,"Adobe Photoshop Album is not worth the price. I would not buy it again. The primary reason is that, regardless of advertising and info on the box, one cannot make an acceptable quality VCD and, of course, no DVD quality disks. Even Adobe admits they do not support MPEG-2 or true MPEG-1 quality. The only value to the product is the ability to send slideshows(very limited editing)by creating a .pdf. Most receivers can then open and view your pictures. Do not buy version 1.0."
2,Didn't Work,"At first I was excited about this product as it organized photos easily and I spent 5 hours putting together a great slide show. My disappointment happened when it wouldn't burn a DVD viewable slide show as advertised....got constant error codes. After numerous lengthy calls to Adobe Tech Support (Non-toll free!). They acknowledged a possible software interface problem with Windows XP and ""their engineers were investigating and it could take up to a month before a fix was developed."" Adobe customer support disappointing too. Called an hour after their advertised opening time only to recieve taped message stating they were closed?"
2,good idea - buggy,"i think some of the features of this program are excellent. the tagging is a very easy and intuitive way to organize the photos. i have about 2000 images and i just blasted thru them... tagging/cross tagging every photo.the problem is... it worked for a few times, and now it hangs everytime! and then i can't end it. i have to do a soft reboot using the power button. XP home (totally new install). i've updated the program w/ 1.01 (which, inexplicably changes the version number to 1.050) and it's still the same problem.so, i can't recommend this program. wait for version 2.0."
1,Buggiest Adobe application ever. Do not buy.,"This is the worst piece of Adobe software ever. If the higher priced applications like Photoshop, etc. would be so bad, Adobe would not exist today. When I installed my copy, I could not even browse to files on my D: partition. Album could only recognize files on the C: partition. Unusable.Look for hundreds of other complaints on Adobe's support discussion board."
1,WATCH OUT!,"DO NOT TRUST THIS SOFTWARE PROGRAM TO SAFELY DOWNLOAD FROM A CAMERA OR CARD READER AND THEN USE THE ""ERASE PHOTOS"" FEATURE ON THE SOURCE!!! All you'll get is thumbnails that can't be printed or viewed! And I had to reboot to find this wonderfull fact out! As the helpful customer service rep at Adobe told me; ""Always copy your digital images to the hard drive first, then acces the images with Adobe's Album. 'Course if you don't have another software program to download from your camera, you're out of luck. I guess I'll go back to using the software that came with my Canon. It never lost any pictures! And another glitch; Album would not download 100% of the photos unless numerous attempts were made...Strange"
4,Very pretty for the price,The earring is very pretty and intricate. An awesome value for the price:)
4,theme book based on the popular series,"It is Valentine's Day and the Builder Team is hard at work. Along the way, 18 flaps of sturdy material can be lifted to reveal various valentine-themed objects, though Valentine's Day itself is never discussed. If your child likes Bob the Builder, this would be an enjoyable book."
3,Wrong Format,"I recently received my long awaited copy and, to my dismay, I discovered it was in Region 2 and would not play on my dvd player. I'll have to return it."
3,It's alright,"This is one of those cheesy classics from the 70's. I enjoyed it somewhat.Basically to sum it up...A group of people growing dope get dusted with a chemical meant to kill their crop. They turn into flesh eating zombies and try to kill campers in the same area.It was alright, it didn't take too long to get to the juicy parts. Although, in my opinion it is NOT worth the Amazon price of 21.00. I'd probably pick it up for 5.00 maximum."
5,Lashner is the best!,This was my first William Lashner novel and still my favorite. After reading this I bought all his books and took a vacation. Lashner's writing skills are unmatched. There are only two writers who can make me get up and lock all the doors and laugh out loud all in the same page. Nelson Demille and William Lashner. Only William Lashner is better. The characters are so real you can almost touch them. After reading all of Lashner's books I find myself wondering aimlessly through book stores in search of a writer just as talented. I'm always disappointed.
2,Wilted Flower,"This book was a disappointment to me. I like to LEARN from anything I invest the time to read. Bloom had a subject more suitable to a short story. Stretched out to novel length, it needed more technological depth, and characters that were more like John Irving's, and less like Tom Clancy's. It definitely had it's moments, but not enough to sustain me through the hours it takes to read."
2,"Excellent concept, poor execution.","Bloom's concept grabbed me right away. Unfortunately, the tone is annoyingly breezy, the plot is predictable, and the characters are unconvincing. The author is an engineer, and it shows; he should have spent less time inventing twenty-second century geek jargon and more time developing his characters."
3,Great beginning; lousy ending,"Gripping, enthralling . . . at least at the start. However somewhere in the book, around three quarters of the way through, the novel takes a turn for the worse. But that was OK, McCarthy could have pulled it off and it still would have been a decent novel. But, NO, the last few pages see another twist and the book spirals in for a crash and burn. And so it ended, leaving me asking this question -- What? Was the manuscript due in a real hurry?"
5,Love this movie!,"This has become one of my all time favorite movies, such a shame it never got the proper audience it deserves. The characters are great and the movie is fun to watch--with a feminist's touch. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again--just fantastic!"
2,V.H.F.,My record of today :ZUCCHERO SUGAR FORNACIARI -Oro Incenso & Birra 'cause it's easy to listen and then I wish an overdose of love to my mother who tomorrow will undergo an operation at fermur--
4,Great cover,"I bought this because during the winter the steering wheel is too cold for comfort and I don't always remember to wear gloves. It fits my Honda Pilot well. It's quite thick and plush making the steering wheel quite bulky for those with smaller hands like me. Nonetheless, I'm glad I got it because I no longer have cold hands."
4,Good product,"It was purchased for my wife's car and she loves it. The one that was on there was falling apart, but this one seems to be exactly what she wanted."
5,Sheepskin Steering Wheel cover,"I completely recommend this product to anyone who wants warm hands duringthe winter, and wearing gloves isn't even necessary with your handswrapped around this product! The cold steering wheel can't be feltwhatsoever through this natural sheepskin product. I have the lightbeige one to match my car, and there is no flyaway fibers that I cansee."
1,VERY VERY poor customer service.,"After waiting about a month for my order to arrive I contacted the seller. They replied to me saying that they would submit a refund. I checked my bank account a few days later to find that they had deducted it AGAIN! so instead of the book, of which I never received, costing me 16.74 it cost me 33.48. I have since e-mailed them again and I never got a reply. I will NOT be using Amazon, or this seller again."
4,HELP!THIS IS TOO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IT'S FUN!IT IS SMALLER.I BOUGHT THE REGULAR ONE. THEN WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE NEW ONE I GAVE IT TO MY SISTER NOW I HAVE THE CHAOS ONE
2,False advertising,"Folks this machine sells for $154.00 at Walmart regular price and even less at other locations. Google it, you will find this machine is not even near the original price it claims of over $449. Prime example of false advertising. Check it out yourselves, don't fall for it."
5,AMAZING machine for the cost!,"This machine is so easy to use, the stitches are great, and the automatic needle threader saves so much time! I bought this as a beginning sewing machine, and I couldn't be happier! It has tons of stitches to choose from and even does button holes! Highly recommend!"
4,"Sewing machines have come a long, long way","Bought a new sewing machine after 20 years and the Brother CS6000 is a dream device. Lightweight, multiple stitch patterns, button hole styles. Wow! It was a little difficult to figure out the automatic needle threading and buttonhole features, but they did work well in the end. The machine is shipped with just the brother sewing machine box, not a separate enclosing box, but it arrived safely anyway. I would buy this machine again and would recommend it to friends."
4,Best value for the money,"I bought this machine through [...] and I received it in less than a week! Their price was the same as Walmart's in my area plus it qualified for free shipping. I have used it for two weeks now and love it. I was looking for a sewing machine (NOT a Singer) that I could use for quilting; on this machine the feed dogs will drop and it came with the walking foot, free motion foot and the extra table. I think it was supposed to include the 1/4"" foot but rather than try to get it through Amazon I bought it at a sewing store. Everything I have tried has worked on this machine. The only thing I would change is the light...it's just not bright enough. I did alot of comparison shopping and read all the reviews and I think it is the best value for a machine of this caliber."
5,Love it!,This is the best sewing machine I've ever owned. The price is amazing for what you get. I use it for quilting and love it!!
2,Smoke and just about flames,"This was a pressy for my partner, first time using it and BAM smoke fuming out not a good start."
3,Bernadine,"It seems to be a good machine, but it is very hard to thread the needle. I haven't been able to get the needle threader to work."
4,"Good price, good machine","After much research I finally decided to order this machine. I received it promptly and had it set up and sewing within 30 minutes. I tried all the stitches and accessories, and all work well. The only accesory it didn't come with was a ruffler. I am making a quilted pillow top and so far so good. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that after I changed thread colors I kept getting an error message and I had to clean it to get it to work. Never did find any jammed thread. Hope that doesn't happen every color change. I love all the decorative stitches and the buttonholes. Since I don't plan on using heavy fabrics I think it will be fine. I have a 30 year old machine (another brand) and will use it for any heavy fabrics. It is a little more noisy than the old one, but I think that is because it is so lightweight. Overall I am pleased with this purchase."
1,disappointed,"My expectations were to high for this CS6000i , it has some good features but in general , for the type of work I do with a sewing machine dog coats mainly for large breeds of dogs it did not match my old Janome Excel II 5024 .Doing buttonholes on polar material is a nigthmare and using some of the fancy stitches on thicker material does not come out very well .The speed lever , can accidently be touch when you sew , just by turning the material for example, this is a bit annoying .I would have taught that with all the sounds alerting you, that this machine would at least alert you when the bobin was out of thread , if you sew with dark thread( which I do a lot ), you don't see well if you are running out of thread .And I do not know if it is me but I have found that I go through a lot more thread with this machine than with my Janome .I will have my Janome reajusted so I can use it again , and I will keep the Brother as a back up ."
3,"Great machine, except ...","I bought this machine nine months ago, and it really is a super little machine except for one thing: you can't maintain it beyond removing dust from the bobbin area. After nine months of reasonable (not even heavy) use, the motor locked up and gave me an error message. Turns out, it just needed oil, but the user can't do it--you must take the machine to an authorized service center, and in my case that service center was over 100 miles away.Except for that one little wrinkle, I like the machine a great deal. It has loads of decorative stitches and sews beautifully on all the fabrics I've tried it on. But if you're any distance from a Brother authorized service center, consider buying a different machine that doesn't require service to perform a simple task like routine maintenance."
5,"works great, easy to use",This thing is awesome. It works great and is easy to use. Brother makes great stuff and I'm happy I bought it.
2,Good machine when it's working...,"I sew quite a lot, at least three times a week and have had this machine for four years. At first I was in love with it, the features were great and all the stitches were wonderful. However it didn't take long before it started acting up and now it seems to break on me every 3-5 months. It may just be that this machine is not made for such frequent usage, however my most recent (and most expensive) problem that I have run into with this machine is that the whole feed dog component collapsed into the machine. It would have been cheaper to buy a whole new machine than to keep forking over $50 here and there to maintain this one. If your looking for an inexpensive machine for beginners than this is a good choice, you pretty much get what you pay for so if you are a frequent sewer than I would recommend forking over a little extra cash and getting a more durable machine."
3,Nice machine,"Overall it's a nice machine, I was a bit dissapointed with the automatic needle threader, the ledge/contraption that has to be pushed down in order to thread the needle seems flimsy and fragile. All in all I like it so far."
3,Some issues.,"I have done a few projects on my new machine. For the most part, it has been really good, nice and easy. I really enjoy not having to use the foot pedal. My last project was not so good. My top thread kept breaking. At first I thought it was a chip in my plate, but that is not the case. I have yet to bring it back out and explore it further. Hopefully it is just my needle or something very fixable, and not a permanent malfunction."
4,use it all the time,"I use this all the time. Kind of lightweight though compared to my old one but I got used to it. The auto needle threading is great. Don't really like having to reset the stitch each time I turn it on though. I wish there was a way it would stay on what I selected, but can't figure how to do that. But overall good sewing machine."
5,Purchased for my wife,"The Brother CS6000I was purchased for my wife. She loves the machine. It is so light weight she can take it anywhere. I have asked her to finish the review.... This has been the best purchase for my new quilting hobby. This machine is comparable to my heavier machine which I love, too. I was suprised on all of the features it has compared to my other machine. The extended sewing surface is a real plus. The variable speed feature, 60 different stitches I have tried out are enough for me to use at a quilt day camp. It does not have the built in scissor function but for a lot less I can carry a pair around with me. I have even made a lap quilt on this machine. Three of my friends at the quilt guild have this same machine and just love it. I have now shown this to my friends at church and they are interested in purchasing this machine simply because of all the features and how light weight it is. I recommend this machine to everyone!"
4,Good sewing machine,"I bought this machine around 6 months ago. It really is easy to use. I especially like how easy it is to change the stitch type. . . you simply press one button and presto, you can go to zigzag, straight stitching, and any of the other 60 stitch options. It's lightweight and easy to move around. I agree with one other user though, that filling the bobbin with thread isn't the easiest, but once you get that done, the sewing part is fun. Worth the money in my opinion."
1,Worst money I have ever spent.,"I set up the machine and wound my first bobbin, however as soon as I finished doing so, the machine decided to blow up, and wouldn't stop smoking for the next 5 minutes. I would not recommend anybody buy this machine and I will definitely be getting a refund."
5,Very pleased!,I have not had this sewing machine too long but already do enjoy it. It has great features and is a great machine for any starter. It has made sewing easy. The stitches are great and there are a variety of them from which to choose. It sews at different speeds depending on comfort level which allows for tedious sewing as well as simple straight stitching. Overall it has been great so far.
5,It is everything it is advertised.,"I received my machine in just a few days, exactly as advertised. I have not had a new machine since 1989 when i had a Singer that cost $1500. This machine so outperforms the Singer. The technology has come so far it is amazing. I am thrilled with it as it will do everything I need if I am mending a seam or making a new Santa Claus suit for the hubby. What a dream machine. I am so glad the old one broke and I purchased this one at 1/10 the cost."
4,Brother sewing machine,This is a great basic sewing machine. The instructions are easy to understand and the machine runs smoothly. Very nice machine for the price.
3,Brother sewing machine,"I am a beginner sewer. My mom who has sewn for about 40 years is giving me lessons. I purchased this machine, and she had a very difficult time getting it setup. She said it was very hard to get the tension right."
2,Not as good of a deal as it looks like!!!,"I bought this sewing machine last February after I read the reviews on Amazon and I thought that this will be good for easy sewing at home. I am a seamstress and I also have a very good sewing machine that I use constantly, this one I bought just for the different stitches. I haven't even used it that much until last week when it broke down completely. It was probably defective from the start, (my husband fixes appliances and he looked at it and couldn't believe how cheaply made this is) and thinks it had a problem from the start when I bought it. I am very disappointed with it because I've had problems constantly with the thread breaking in spite of doing everything right and using the right needles. If you don't have the expensive good quality thread, good luck sewing with this one. I want to warn people that this is not as good of a deal as it looks like!"
4,Wife likes sewing machine.,"My wife likes this machine that replaced a much heavier and hard to use Pfaff machine. After too much frustration, we threw the old machine in the garbage.My wife is not a heavy sewer, but needs to hem pants and skirts from time to time. After reading the minimal instructions, we figured it out within an hour. So far, she has hemmed three pairs of jeans for me and a couple skirts for herself.The machine would be easier to use if the LCD screen showing type and length of stitching was back-lighted.pjs"
5,Great machine for the price,I bought one of these for a gift and one for myself as well. The gift was a hit and I made Christmas gifts with mine this year. Nice machine.
5,Love it!,"It was time to recondition my 1953 Singer sewing machine once again. A year older than me, I have been using it for many decades. But when I received the estimate for the recondition, I decided to look for something more affordable.This machine is amazing! Admittedly, updating from a 58-year-old machine to a 21st-century machine is a big jump. But it has been wonderful. I love it, and it's great to be able to push a button and have all these wonderful stitches to choose from. I am finishing up a quilt, and it's great fun to be able to add all these fancy stitches to my quilting with a mere push of a button.I highly recommend this machine!"
4,So Far So Good as a First Sewing Machine,"I've only had this machine for about a month now, so I can't say anything about the long-term. However, it seems to work great as my first sewing machine. I enjoy the fact that you don't need to use the foot pedal. The user's manual is also pretty useful and instructive (especially as user-manuals go). I did run into some trouble getting tangled thread, but that was my own fault for using the wrong needle."
4,LOVE!,"I have been using an $80 Brother for about 7 years, and I loved it. Then I found this one for a great price and Santa (aka UPS) brought it to me for Christmas. I AM IN TOTAL LOVE! It's exactly like my old machine, only a million times better. It is smooth, it is intuitive, it has a ton features I am going to use all the time. The only complaint I might have is it is a lot louder than my old machine. Packaged great and set up for basic sewing was a breeze, can't wait to try out more features!"
5,great,I am still learning this machine. It has started acting up a little breaking thread. I thinkl I might need to read a little more to see why
4,works great,"for the price it is a good little machine. If you want a decent machine for mending and crafts, etc.. it is well worth the money"
4,Great choice for everyday use.,"Works very well, reliable and durable. have been using it for about a year excellent. Would recommend this to others."
3,Price skyrocketing before my very eyes,"I bought this machine 3 months ago for $151. It's now over $180. Every time I look at this Amazon page, the price goes up a couple of dollars. Ridiculous. I need to buy another one, but the price is skyrocketing as I watch, and for that reason, I'll pass on another one."
1,Worst Machine Ever,"I purchased this machine for light craft sewing and thought it would be fine. It is the worst machine I have ever used. I threaded everything properly, high quality thread, etc. The bottom stiches look like there is something wrong with the tension. You can only adjust the top tension, not the bottom. I adjusted to all possible positions, but no luck. I took the machine to a local dealer and he checked it and said I am doing everything right, it is just a bad machine. Furthermore, I had a problem with another household appliance purchased from Amazon, which the manufacturer replaced with one that worked. So, I am beginning to think that the products available for such great prices on Amazon are knock offs, or rejects. I will not purchase another piece of equipment this way."
5,nice machine,"My old machine was unmanageable any more. I got this machine. It is very easy to use. I completed 2 absolutely different projects. 1st was a winterized curtains, and 2nd was Christmas dress from very light fabric. Both projects turned amazing and fun to do."
4,good sewing machine,"this is a great sewing starter sewing machine for a reasonable price. i had no idea how to use one, and after an hour i figured it out."
1,Do NOT buy this,"This model did not work for me. I was looking for a middle of the road machine since i do not sew as much as i use to. It is very lightweight, has the feel of a toy machine. It ""travels"" on the table when i sew.There is not much space between the needle and the arm of the machine so larger projects are out of the picture. Due to an error on my part (I did not change the setting for a stitch) the needle arm jammed into the throat plate. There was no way to correct it. I have sewn for over 40 years on an old singer model with no problem.I brought it to a local repair shop and the cost of repair was not worth throwing good money after bad.So i upgraded to a much better Brother model.Buyer beware. I should have researched this better before buying."
2,Tension Problems,"I too bought the Brother and had tension problems. I returned it for the cheapest computerized Janome I could find. I got the 8050 from Hancock Fabrics (same as the DC1050). I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Janome. I have had it for about two months. I use it nearly every day. I've done quilting, denim, and knits and have not had a single problem with it tension-wise. It's easy to set up and works like a dream! The only downside is that it is hard to find accessories, as the Brother and Singer class 15 bobbins that are sold at Walmart and JoAnns do not work on the Janome. It does not come with nearly as many feet as the Brother. The Brother would be a great deal if it worked. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Great machine. Easy to use.,"When the ex left the machine went with her. This sewing machine is lighter, does more and is easier to use. Great buy."
5,Very Good Machine,"This machine is a great buy. We bought a sewing machine for $80 a year ago, and it fell apart already. It was really loud, moved while sewing, got tangled regularly, etc. But, we started getting serious about constructing garments, and knew we needed a new, better machine. This was my final choice. It was between this one and a Singer model for $500. This machine had more accessories included, and better ratings, and a better price. Since we received it, we have used it a ton! We love the one step buttonhole option. This is a great product for anyone looking for something with a wide selection of options without a large price tag. Really great value for the dollors spent! Recommend it to anyone!"
5,nice machine,THIS IS A GREAT SEWING MACHINE. I'VE SEWN FOR MANY YEARS AND USED VARIOUS MACHINES. THIS IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND VERY EASY TO USE.
3,Missing Pieces,"Got the machine 2 days early couldnt wait to get it out of the box. Any way I went through the feet that was suppose to go with the machine and I am missing the 1/4 inch sewing foot! and that is the foot that I use the most! rather upset it is not there..... I know, I know its a small thing but when that is a foot that you use the most it really is a bummer. Can you send me 1? please or do I need to spend more money on 1?Also just for a heads up, was missing a bobbin, but thats not a big deal. bobbins are cheaper then dirt!"
5,OMG!!!!!,"OMG!!!!! I have not touched a sewing machine in 35 yrs and when I received this machine I was a bit intimidated by it but within 20 min. (I kid you not) I was sewing like I knew what I was doing!! I LOVE this machine, very user friendly, just read the booklet and followed along and I had absolutely no problems. I also bought the universal carry case with it but decided to send it back (thanks Amazon for making that process very, very easy), the case was way too big for the machine. This machine does come with a cover that will work for me when I go to quilting class. Thanks again Amazon for making this purchase worth every dollar!!!"
5,Wow! Amazing!,"This machine is awesome! I have never sewed on a sewing machine in my life and my husband got this for me off my wishlist (thanks amazon) and it arrived yesterday, I made a scrub top last night! It is so easy to use a child could do it! Love this machine! Can't wait to do more projects!"
5,My Wife Loves Me,"I bought this sewing machine as a gift for my wife's birthday and I think she called it ""The best gift ever."" I'm not sure since she was busying kissing up on me and being all happy.She's already used it several times and says it's very easy to set up and straight-forward. We haven't had any issues thus far. She'll even be using it to teach me how to sow soon and simple is very important for me since I'm sewing-impaired.Overall, a fantastic machine for a low cost."
1,A good book for children w/ no knowledge in robotics.,"The author says that the book is geared towards 7th-12th graders, but the book is far more basic than that. If you don't know a thing about robots or robotics, or would like to interest a child in robotics - this would be a good book to get.If you already know about robotics, and are pursuing it, this would not be a good purchase. The book has no how-to information, only what the robot does.The information in the book is most often a picture and name of a robot, who it was built by, what the robot does, and what sensors it uses. I already knew about every mentioned robot, before I purchased the book just by surfing the internet."
4,What do you want to know?,"Its a red sash, goes around my 50 inch waist once with plenty of slack, a thinner person could wrap it twice or so like they used to. It hasn't broken, is still red, and has yet to catch fire at random. I recomend it. For heavy people like me get 2 and some thread for a proper waist sash."
3,There are better books on Shamanic practises,"This book is OK at telling you what American Indian Spirituality is, but does not give you information you can actualy use.Read any of the following books for that information. I have listed them in the order I recommend them.""Foolscrow: Wisdom and Power"" Thomas E Mails""Native Wisdom"" Ed McGaa""Mother Earth Spiritualiy"" Ed McGaaIf you have questions or comments; E-mail me. Two BearsWah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
2,Too theoretical,"I didn't like this book because I didn't find any useful suggestions to put theory into practice. It does give a description of the 7 Paths, but it doesn't say exactly what you should do in each step of your transformation. It is very philosophical, and the only parts where it gets practical are the sections in which the author tells her own experience. Even though I understand that for some people just reading about someone else's experience is enough to understand and copy their attitude, I need something more. Maybe I expected a series of tips and instructions, and this is not what this book is about.That said, the author seemed to me a very inspired woman and the things she says are interesting, from a merely philosophical point of view."
5,Gorgeous,"I am amazed at how fast Gem Ave shipped my ring I got it 4 days ahead of schedule and it is a gorgeous ring. i am so pleased with the quality and I will definitely order from them again. Love, Love, Love this ring."
4,Like Taking A Moment To Catch Your Breath,"Admit it; it's hard to resist a book that explains how to simplify your organization and ""make smarter"" your approach to work. Not to mention it's hard to resist any book that quotes both Groucho Marx and Epictetus at the same time. There's symmetry to Bill Jensen's approach to dealing with information overload and the blur of life at internet speed. This book is useful and worth the brief investment of time it takes to read. It's also laid out in a way that shows the author walks his talk when it comes to information design."
2,It's a pity,"The topic is right - and the direction is correct. However: A book on simlicity should be more simple, more structured and especially more to the point. I may say this because I know the challenge on a day to day basis: - How to communicate IT-Value to top management ? - How to explain business to IT people ? - Why should some thousand sales people work with our applications ? What's in for them in using their PC ? If you have to do that you soon learn the value of simplicity and a basic understanding of how it works. If you've worked through that book you probably get some sense of it, however: - It takes you longer than necessary. - It doesn't help you so much in applying simplicity. - Instead you find assertions like those that teams don't help you with simplicity - If you ever worked in a non-teambased environment, you know that that assertion is - simply - WRONG."
4,Recently it out performed my trusty sandisk reader.,"Got this a while back, but use it mostly for traveling. Recently I tried to download my micro sd card on my trusty sandisk multicard reader, but it wouldn't download it, so I popped in my travel reader. Worked like a charm. Only wish that it had a led on it like my sandisk and that the cord was longer. Other than that, great little device. Love it."
5,great jacket for all around use,"tough shell with a great fit, very comfortable. not designed for cold weather w/out layering clothing. you will stay dry in the jacket during wet weather.highly recommend"
5,awesome CD,"This CD is one of the best CD's I have ever bought! You have songs such as Ms. Jackson, So Fresh So Clean, and The Whole World. I recommend that you buy this CD, not only cause of the artists, but also the beat of the songs."
3,Good album but doesn't have all their best songs,"I feel that this complilation does not do Outkast justice in that it does not have all their good songs. Where is ""Wheels of Steel"" and countless others. Do your self a favor and get all their albums, because they are all classics!"
1,"Donkey Tonkey , I mean are you Joking me?!?!","I dont know where they found this joker. This music is simply not good. Its like smooth jazz with this guy singing along to these ridiculously simple song structures that simply are repetitive and don't sound good. This music goes absolutly no where and it is very boring. A lot of this guys music is [borrowed] too. Also their is a song called Donkey Tonkey on here which really made me want to [hit] this guy, its like a kids anthem ""Do the Donkey, the Donkey Tonkey"" ..."
4,"The Indian Doctor, Series One","A very charming beginning for what promises to be a good series, with many ongoing stories blended into the main idea. I'm looking forward to Series Two!"
5,Switchblade sharp,"Silva has endeared himself to the crowd that seek more than just 007 spy action. He has created human characters that struggle with the reality of their actions. He lifts the veil on the German machine showing the grays that are usually depicted as pure black in other creations. The Unlikely Spy is a book that I had an unusual amount of fun reading. And the ending was very enjoyable. Too many times you reach the end of a book like this and it just doesn't live up to the action and intrigue of the body. Unlikely delivers from front to back. If you have any interest in espionage or WWII fiction, you can't miss this."
1,put me to sleep,"I can't believe this book got such rave reviews - and even worst, that someone compares to ""Eye of the Needle"". I had high hopes and expectations and kept at it for a while hoping that at some point it would pick up but at best it's a mediocre, unsophisticated attempt at a thriller - without feeling and without real character development. By the middle started to skip entire sections hoping that at some point it would l but generate some excitgement but finally gave up."
4,Daniel Silva is Brilliant,"Mr. Silva took us back to WWII in this intriguing book. Simply put, I have never read a Daniel Silva book that I did not love. I look forward eagerly to each of his new books."
4,The Unlikely Spy,"I thought that this was a great spy/WWII thriller. The beginning was a tad slow, but kept me interested. From the middle to the end I could not put the book down. Being a real spy/thriller authority, I rate this book at least a 4.5 and well worth the read. This is a fresh new author."
3,"Well-written, easy to read, utterly predictable.","Just how in the world did the Allies ever pull off theNormandy landing? With so many spies, double agents, deepcover agents, and traitors eager to get the straight dope tothe Fuhrer, are we really sure we're not living in the ""Fatherland""?""The Unlikely Spy"" slinks through very familiar territory, from ""The Eye of the Needle"" to ""WhereEagles Dare"" with a side trip to Le Carre land thrown and an optional visit to ""Enigma"". From the first attention-grabbing brutal murder, through theobligatory sex scenes, to the stop them at any cost!finale, the reader encounters the expected.There are, however, worse ways to spend an evening thancurled up with a beautiful spy, tenacious British cop, handsome American architect/officer/patsy, and the other usual suspects. We may know them all a little too well, but, we'll always have the Pas de Calais."
5,DANIEL SILVA AT BEST,"I'm collecting Daniel Silva's books, some I've read before and am reading again. I just like a good action thriller, never disappointed in his plots."
5,Poirot season 2 a delight.,"I have enjoyed both season 1&2. Poirot is delightful and done with great panache by all of the cast. Would recommend to any ""period"" loving person. The setting seems truly authentic."
3,BIZARRE RELIGIOUS SHOCK SCHLOCK,"HELL HOUSE is a Halloween Horror Funhouse designed as an evangelical soul-saving tool by the Trinity Assembly of God Church on the outskirts of Dallas, Texas. Begun in 1990, the tradition has grown to include actors and special audio and lighting effects crews. Special tour guides dressed as demons guide 10,000 visitors through scenes of high school massacres, date rapes, bloody botched abortions, gruesome drunk driving crashes, AIDS related death scenes and more. The filmmakers -- in true verite style -- make no commentary as they record everything from initial script meetings through the lavish stage production of this peculiar, over-the-top sermon meant to scare the hell out of non-believers. I was absorbed by the intimate portrait of this individuals in this religious community -- so isolated from mainstream culture -- who fervently believe in their enterprise. The film features a score by Bubba and Matthew Kadane."
5,One of her best,"This coming of age story of two sisters in India is one of Kamala Markandaya's finest works, and my favorite of hers. It is a story of awakening, exploring a time when a child, through events beyond her control, loses her childhood naivete, descriptively termed as her ""bubble"". An adult book with a timeless story that explores childhood, womanhood, poverty, abortion, prostitution and humanity in a chaotic world."
1,BATTERY,THIS ITEM WAS SENT WITOUT AN ORIGINAL PACKAGEAS SEEN ON THE PICTURE. TWO BATTERIES WERE PUT IN A SMALL PLASTIC BAGAND IT WAS ALSO WRONG. 625A WAS SENT INSTEAD OF 625U.
5,Great Book,"Although, I have not had the chance to completely review the book, my brief scan showed it to be very interesting. I am sure the book will give me some brilliant ideas to work with."
2,Ink Cartridges,"These arrived rather mangled and one of them didn't work. Rather than fuss with trying to return it, I decided I would go back to buying locally."
5,Good Purchase,"Not only will you save a lot of money on the cartridges, you will find that they perform every bit as well as the original HP carts."
5,Could this be the answer?,"The impression I got from reading this book is that Shri Mataji is someone with a lot of common sense, which really helps when wading through the vast number of books that touch on similar subjects. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a simple, practical, and wise approach to life."
5,Transforming,"This book is filled with a strong dose of wisdom mingled with common sense, to understand the social and psychological problems we face here in the west. Lack of Spirituality and maintaining Sacred traditions as referred by this Author, cause an emotional vaccum within our beings which we as a culture try to fill in with materialism. Hence, the feeling of true joy remains elusive. We are not just physical and mental beings but spiritual beings who without connection to our spirit feel empty.This book reaffirms to me the simple truths of Life and the need for us to feel a spiritual connection within ourselves and with others. It is transforming because it shifts me from the belief that I am merely human, to someone who is connected with the Divine, and therefore more precious."
5,An amazing book,"I love this book, because it speaks so simply about the reality we are all facing today, and also gives so simple and truthful ways to solve some of these problems.Each time I have read this book, it really opened my heart and gave me such comfort."
4,Very interesting book.,Very good book ! Honest presentation of the work of Max Freedom Long. I am still reading it for my research.
1,Waste of money. Ice melts in a hurry!!,"OK so we have the marine version of this cooler, which I think amounts to a change from blue to white plastic. Otherwise it's identical. We should have returned it right away, but didn't - now we're stuck with a cooler that keeps ice for about 2 hours. Had a lot of the features we wanted incl a food tray. It's incredibly heavy when full, and without wheels OR A DRAIN this thing is a pain. Yes a cooler this big WITHOUT A DRAIN! Who'da thought?It's a pain in the a## when 20 lbs of ice melts in 2 hrs and you have REMOVE YOUR STUFF to dump out gallons of water to add another $4 bag of ice!!DON""T BUY! We were hoping for the best cooler ever to take on the boat. You are much better off with a regular $19 Walmart backyard cooler."
5,A great read,"Jack Warner is a master storyteller.I've been privileged to enjoy Warner's work for more than 20 years, from his days as a wire-service deskman to newspaper reporter to his station in life now as a novelist. He is one of the finest writers I've encountered. He doesn't waste words or mince them; he can tell you more in two sentences than most writers can in 20. His writing is elegant and illuminating and never flabby. He is effusively efficient.After only a few pages of ""Shikar"" you will feel the man-eating tiger's yellow, glowing eyes stalking you. You will also feel a strong reluctance to put the book down. You might also never look at a walk in the woods the same way again.This is a heart-stopping thriller but also a sweet story about a noble old man and an innocent young boy with more in common than one might imagine. These are characters with hearts and souls.My wish is that Jack Warner writes faster. I can't wait for his next book."
1,Yeah - she's a true artist,"This album really shows Britney stretching out. The songs are entirely different from her earlier albums, and I think you can really detect the difficult life she leads and the inner turmoil she feels in a lot of the touching songs.Really an amazing album. The cover clearly indicated that this was not to be confused with her other albums."
4,All grown up,"{BRITNEY} screams independence. Britney's songs shows that she wants some fun and space. I love this CD.The first CD says...'im a pop princess',the next CD says...'im a hottie in red spandex', this last one says...'gimme some room to find who i am and what i want'.Brinteny's music is kool, and she is my idol...i just wish she'd rethink her clothing sometimes."
3,this is hard...,"Alright. I listen to Britney Spears, and have this cd. It's not what you'd call brilliant, but it isn't slutty or much. She has talent, but most people can't really see it-they just see the photos and the clothes, then immeadiatly diss her. I wouldn't listen to this cd day and night, but I think it's totally fine...though she sounds sorta creepy in the first song. SO...I'm not saying she rocks-or sucks. I'm saying she deserves the credit for this cd."
3,Britney,"Um...WHAT HAPPENED??? Her last 2 albums were so good... well, this album is okay. It's not as bubble-gummy as her first two albums. Worst songs:I'm a Slave 4 u, Boys, Let Me Be.Best songs: Overprotected, Cinderella, I Love Rock 'N Roll."
3,eh..,"well..after hearing this album, I was thinking, ""Hmm..what time is it?"" the album was pretty much boring and I thought the music was pretty much the same; they were like her other albums/songs only this album has more cuss words (hmmm..like 3 or 4 in total), the repetitive use of the word ""sexy"" and ""baby"", and less slow tunes. Don't get me wrong, i thought some songs were great, but most of 'em were kinda bad. The best song would have to be ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" or ""Anticipating""."
5,AWESOME,You dont have to be a Britney fan to love this one!! Its mixture of her classic POP and the brand new Britney's own R&B and Rock&Roll. Britney defenitely speaks her mind on the 6 songs she wrote...So my tip is: BUY IT. If you didnt like any of her other album...forget them and get this one...cuz' Im sure you'll love it Just like I did!
2,Her weakest album yet.,"Britney Spears's Britney album is a 12 track fiasco. Only two songs truly grabbed my attention which are That's Where you Take me, and Lonely. She shows potential on songs like Anticpating and Let Me Be but the rest of the songs are pretty awful and embarrasing like the song, Bombastic Love. In the Zone and Oops...I did it again are her best albums. Of course lately I could care less about Spears, her career is in the toilet and she knows it. This album was a waste of time and money for the pop princess, I am sorry to say but she could use some singing lessons, her success ain't because she has a spectacular voice, her success is all image. This disc belongs in a junk yard, skip this one."
2,What happened?!?!?!,"Britney Spears was very popular when I was a kid. My sister gave me her first 2 albums (which by the way were great!) They were fun, had good songs, and good albums for a young girl. When I got this album I was to young to understand some things. Now I understand everything clearly. When I listen to this CD today, I think to myself ""What kind of a song is BOYS?! That is the most stupidest, weirdest song on her album!"" Along with I'm a slave 4 u. Uh, get real, Britney. Those are inappropriate songs that I don't think kids parents would want them listening to. I know my parents aren't a fan of them. It's kinda like rap. It's not the best music out there. Even though it's everywhere..you don't need to like it. So, you dont need to like Britney and some of her songs because it's not all that good. But if you like her, I don't care . Go ahead and buy her CD!"
4,not bad but could be better..,"This girl isn't very good with expressing herself very well lyrically. Some of her songs are very good and some are very bad. she needs help leaving the kid department and entering the adult category. it shows she has the potential in this CD. But with songs like ""What It's Like To Be Me"", ""Bombastic Love"" and ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" ya gotta wonder. The rest of the CD, especially the bonus songs were very beautiful. I didn't think she had it in her (the bonus songs), but I was shocked because she was so good and honest. ......."
5,You go girl,This is the cd for the fans from Britney. Britney has really grown from album to album you can totally tell from this album how she has grown as a artist. This has to be the best cd yet! When I first heard it I had to look at the jaket to see what songs Britney wrote and she kicks ...for a songwriter!I am glad she is writing and making sure her voice is heard. Way to go girl I am so very proud of u for showing us the real side of you!
5,britney rules,"well she did it again...all the haters and the critics were wrong, she is back and better than ever. this cd is amazing and she is the next madonna, no doubt. every song on here is really good but the stand-outs are ""im a slave 4 u"" ""overprotected"" ""not a girl"", jeez they are all awesome so go out and buy this cd today!"
4,Great Job!!!,"I am a Britney fan, but this is honestly the first of her 3 CD's that I buy. I really, really like this CD. Her voice sounds better than her previous work, and the songs are more grown up. I love tracks #1,2,4,8,9. The others are also good, but those are my faves. Anyone who likes her, will also love this CD!"
1,who would spend money on this?,"Britney tried to go a different direction with this album, and reaaly she should have just stuck with being a marketing tool. She CAN'T sing. Her music is just plain terrible, if she wants a different, sexy direction that would be artistic then being a stripper at some classy bar would be a better bet than releasing this.If you bought this album, then I suggest the best way to use it would be to beat the person who reccomended this to you with it. If you are looking for some good music I reccomend Tool or Pink Floyd. If you want an album that has been released recently I suggest either the new Perfect Circle,the Beatles album, or Coldplay."
1,what were you thinking britney?,bad is the only word that can describe thisalbum listening to this cd makes me wonderhow down can she godont buy this cd or you will be badly disapointedin one hand the music is suitable for young girlsand in the other hand the lyricses are not suitable even foradult
1,really really bad,"my friend got this cd, and i must say it really ... she really looks and sings like a .... (no offence to britney) sure the first cd was kinda cute, but after that they just all went way downhill. now if u want some GOOD music, worth listening to, i suggest Eminem (the eminem show)or Good Charlotte."
4,THIS IS BRITNEY BEST ALBUM TO DATE!,"Many would consider Britney Spears a pure sex-pop seller, but this album is good crafted pop tunes, nothing more, nothing less, as almost every album release, this collection includes timeless classic(I'm A Slave 4 U), great unfairly judge songs(Overprotected, Boys, Lonely, Cinderella, Bombastic Love), fillers (Let Me Be, That's Were You Take Me), bubble gummy songs (Anticipating), junkie covers (I LOve Rock N Roll) and bad songs (I'm NOt A Girl Not Yet A Woman) sounnd like 'nsync on ""What's It's Like To Be Me"", this album is great to listen too, it's easy pop that you need in a daily day basis, great buy!. Check Mandy Moore's self titled album better than this one."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was surprised to find myself enjoying most of the songs on this CD. On her previous ones, I liked 2 or 3, but on ""Britney"" I like all the songs EXCEPT 2 or 3. She did well to sing fast, edgy songs that fit her raspy voice rather than trying to pretend that she can sing. Even the ballad, I'm Not a Girl, is good and doesn't ruin the tone of the album."
1,Horrible!,"Another album with slutty songs written by horny guys who can't get any action. Britney gets more pathetic with each album. There are so many more talented artists out there: Ashlee Simpson, Gretchen Wilson, Leann Rimes, Shania Twain, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore n Hilary Duff. All who write their own music and have actual talent. I agree with Kristen Dunker ""Kat"" This album is pure smut and sends an inappropriate message to young girls. Girls are under enough peer pressure and they don't need this tart adding to it with suggestive lyrics and skimpy outfits."
3,Predictable.,"I love Britney and everything, but I definitely expected a little more ""personalization"" with this album. I was hoping the album would be a little more personal than it was. I like the sound of the songs, and it really isn't a bad album, but I would really like Britney to get down to the nitty-gritty and let us in on how she feels, without repressing herself. Its definitely sounds different from her other two albums, but sound is one thing, and lyrics are another. If you like POP, like I do, then I would recommend the album, and of course, any Britney fan better not go without it! :)"
2,So this is it ??,"Although I liked the first single ""I'm a slave for you"" for its freshness I have to say that Britney's 3rd album is disappointing.Most of the songs are lame. And unlike promised she did not write ""all the songs except 2"" only co-write 5 tracks.Contrary to her last album this one does not seem to have a theme that dominates it, it is more like a chaotic mix.The cover version of I love rock'n'roll is nice but not innovative at all.The songs Overprotected, Cinderella and Let me be are funky though.But I don't think that's enough to save the album."
3,Fun for a party but holds no substance,"As much as I love the music as something I would more than likelyh hear at a party, the songs on this album don't hold a lot of substance showing some actual effort was put forth to compose the various songs"
2,I won't of bought this cd.....,"I actually Got Britney free through an offer. I only gave it 2 stars because there is a few songs because there is some good songs. I'm Not yet,a woman is good. I'm A Slave For you is good also. I don't reccomend this cd though. If you like the chipmunks then this is for you because that is what she sounds like. If you are offered this cd free only take it for the few good songs."
4,And she leaves em in the dust...,"I gave this CD 4 stars b/c I think it rocks (the full 15 song-version) but there's always room for improvement. For example, the remixes released as singles were a BIG improvement over the album tracks. The best songs: When I Found You, Not A Girl (remix), That's Where You Take Me, Lonely, & I Run Away (she sounds awesome in this song.)I think people underrate her singing. She sounds chirpy sometimes on CD but that's b/c of the songs she sings. She has an amazingly low and soulful voice when she sings slow ballads and she could improve on her sound if she sang more like that.By now, I think she's obviously proved she's left her clones and competitors in the dust. She definitely is the only one with long term staying power and she keeps raising the bar with each release...I can't wait for the fourth. Rock On, Brit."
5,Let me Share my Opinion of This Britney Album with you......,Barf!!!!!!!! Puke!!!!! Gag!!!!! Belch!!!!Thanks for allowing me to share these sentiments with you.
