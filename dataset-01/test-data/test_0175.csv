5,TADA the Black stallion and the sonsssss there of for too4th,Every Girl or Woman Young at heart needs this read. I can not believe There is such a house hold that does not own a copy of this wonderful read.Hey even the young guys that like girls will want to have read it a half dozen times.Yes Claudette I read it that many just to leep up with you in the third grade. Yeas I said Leep up or is it leap or was it keep UP UP and away.Hey we moved away when I was 10 but I did learn thank you very very much.dray
4,A good book about war-time London,"""Sally of Seefon Grove"" by Dee Williams open up the funeral of nineteen year old Sally Fuller's mother. The untimly death of her mother marks the changes in Sally's life. The coming of World War two will change the live of everyone in Seefon Grove but as a many as Sally's life.This is another great book by Ms. Williams. She really shows the reader what life was life during the war. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that for some people, the dialogue may bother some reader."
2,The vampire Lovers: A Tale of A Female Vampire,"I've seen some of this film. I am confused as to what this film is. is this the hardcore 91 minute version, or the softcore 87 minute version. I would buy this tape if i knew.From what i've seen, and heard this film is a waek adaptation of Seridian Le Fanu's vampire novel. It was rated Pg in a dVD double feature with Countess Dracula. I find that hard to belive.I heard that there is a DVD version of the 87 minute cut film, and I'm looking for It!-The Hammer Film Reveiwer HIMSELF!!!"
3,"Solid content, bad format","This is a case where some good content was obscured by inappropriate style and formatting. The format of the visual quick start guide series is two have two columns on what is already a fairly thin page. One column is explanation for the screenshot on the other side. That works great for learning about Powerpoint but isn't so great for basic C, which is mainly text. The screenshots just waste space and the code in the explanation side has to be so compressed that it is very tough to follow.As an alternative you should try O'Reilly's Practical C, or Bruce Eckel's Thinking in C++."
2,Average Quality For Price,"The Amazon Marketplace seller substituted Merkury and Bower Optics for the Tokina Professional products listed. Other than that, the products provided appear to be of Average to Good value for the price paid. Use of the 3x Telephoto will require use of a tripod or other stable platform to insure adequate image focus. Due to the extended lens barrel length, use of the camera's flash will leave a shadow on the images.Reality check: At Best, using Optic converters on a point-n-shoot camera provides a level of flexibility to novice, cost conscious photographers."
1,its a roll of the dice with this one,"i bought this it took 3 wks to break in, did the recomended modifcations, got it setup and bubbling ran out of the house for awhile and i came back it had over flowed and the tank was minus 2 gillons, so people say thier great but I can not"
4,Had 2 for years,"I've used a SeaClone100 hanging on back of a 55-gal for about 10 years and it works fine. Keep the O-Rings fresh, clean the joints, intake and filter and it will last for years. I use another SeaClose100 on an 80-gallon and I have to empty the cup every two weeks. Can't find better in this price range."
1,Daughter disappointed with guitar,"I purchased this for my 5 year old. The television commercials made the guitar appear to be a karaoke sing along. The guitar does hook up to your TV set, but it loads a game that appears on the TV display. You have to press the correct keys as the Bratz Rock Angel sings. The graphics weren't very good, and even I wasn't able to press the keys quickly enough to win the game. Overall, we were very disappointed and returned the product."
1,The only part that works is the rain gauge.,"I bought this for a home school unit for my 8-year-old about the weather, and was so disappointed! The only part of it that actually works is the rain gauge (so my only compliment is that that part does not leak)! The thermometer says it is always exactly 48 degrees, and the wind always blows north. If I hadn't spent so long assembling it and it weren't such a hassle, I'd send it back. Since I don't plan to, the next best way to make my point is to advise everyone else not to buy one!"
2,The Cliff Notes on DVD,I read and enjoyed the book and was curious how the movie would play. Ugh. This movie was like taking the cliff notes and filming it. What a disappointment. Robert Pattinson as Jacob was a mis-cast if ever there was one. A more likely role for him might be blue jean model in a poster on the side of a bus. Reese Witherspoon did as fine a job as could be done I suppose.If you haven't read the book forget about this movie and invest the time to read the book. Whatever your imagination does to fill out the characters while reading will undoubtedly be better that what was done with this movie.
2,Wheres the beef?,"I thought WFE would be a terrific old fashioned Greatest Show On Earth type movie from hollywoods earlier era. But boy what a boring and predictable yarn this was. Hal Holbrook and Christopher Waltz make the film watchable. The lack of romantic chemistry between the two leads is pathetic. There simply was no passion on the screen at all between them. But the biggest fault of this film is that the director decided to put Rosie ,the elephant, in the backdrop of the story- Unforgiveable. Rosie is really what the film should center around. Instead we get a lukewarm love story. I really wanted this film to blow me away but alas it turned to be another quick fader. Could have been a masterpiece. Instead it is just a piece."
3,3 stars,"It was a pretty good movie that generally followed the book. But there were a few major deviances from the book, clearly made to simplify things, I was not pleased with. Also, having read the book first, I just couldn't see Reese Witherspoon as the leading lady. I love Reese and all, just not in this role."
4,circus lovers delight,i enjoyed this film so much all the actors were so talented at their roles and the animals were amazing!
2,Not new in box,"I was under the impression that I purchased this item new, but when it arrived it had been opened previously!"
5,Water for Elephants,"I was really impressed with the actors, it was as if you knew them,,very good movie, it kept my attention. would recememd it to others."
5,Water For Elephants,Water for Elephants is really an amazing movie. I bought a copy for myself and for a few members of my family for Christmas!
4,Water For Elephants,"This dvd was well received, and held attention as it was fast moving and interesting.Acting was good, and story moving."
1,Elephant was abused during training,"The elephant in, ""Water for Elephants"" was abused during training. Given the story line of the film, it is particularly offensive. The owner's of the elephant in this film, Have Trunk Will Travel, were video recorded abusing the elephant during training (hitting and stabbing with metal rod, electric shock and whipping). If you google it there will be numerous links to the video footage."
3,Will Smith,"This book is pretty good reading for someone interested in Will Smith's journey through life. It covers Will's life in West Philly to his rise in Hollywood. Very funny, and enjoyable!"
5,I Don't Understand the Music Business,"Music is incredibly personal, but I still don't understand why this album hasn't hit the Big Time. I come back to it over and over, impulsively cranking the volume on evey other tune (Wonder and The Girl is Crying are my favorites, but they really all rock). I don't think they sound like Better Than Ezra; I hear a slicker version of another great, obscure band, the Gigolo Aunts. It's really worth giving it a spin."
1,"Movie Yes, Soundtrack No","Sorry Samuel, the movie ""Black Snake Moan"" was good, but the soundtrack not so good."
5,Childhood Replacement,"This was a gift to a friend who grew up with a Webby doll, but has since lost posession of it. She was extremely happy to have the doll and a link to happy chilhood memories. I would recommend this to anyone who grew up in the 80's with the Duck Tales."
5,SMART STRIP,"Energy Saving Smart Strip with Autoswitching Technology and Fax/modem ProtectionVery good item,needed somathing like this for years"
2,Disappointment,"I like the arrangement and number of the outlets. That's why I gave it 2 stars.The outlets, ALL OF THEM are functionins simply as OUTLETS.The ones that are SUPPOSED TO TURN OFF, DOESN'T !!!!It's smart alright, from a marketing view point to sell these.But not so SMART to buy one."
4,So far so good,"Power strip works great with my home entertainment setup. The cabinet stays cool during the day now that the transformers for all the electronics are turned off. While it's still to early to gauge the actual energy savings, I estimate the unit will pay for itself within a year."
4,baba,"Once you figure out where to plug things in, you realize how much it can save you in electric bills. Good investment."
5,BRAVO V.C. ANDREWS WRITERS!,"I have read and own every v.c. andrews book ever written. I have never been a big reader until the day I picked up one of her books. These are the only books that I can read from cover to cover. Yes, they are sometimes disturbing, but at least people aren't getting killed in bizarre ways, like Stephen King. I do agree that children or young teenagers should not read these books. I also feel they should make movies for all of her series. Keep it up V.C. Andrews writers!!"
4,Good getaway book,"A good read, and probablly the best series. However, it bothered me how this book didn't bridge to the others in that Luke's character changes dramatically and contradicts how he is portrayed in WofD. Later on, it is said that he sleeps around on Leigh during their marraige and ends up as an abusive fater toward the baby he swears to her that he'll love. A little unbelieveable, but interesting and bittersweet."
2,Sooooo dull,"Ugh, i couldn't see a trailer for this anywhere so i thought heck let's try it. Sheesh, this movie is dull and a bit too modern for what i wished to get. I felt no suspense no fear, it lacked atmosphere and was just a drab ""who done it"" of some guy in a ski mask threatening some duke for stolen diamonds and choking people at random in his household. If you want an older HORROR film stay clear of this"
5,a great sophomore release,"This album is great, especially if you dig old guns n' roses or hanoi rocks. I would recommend searching the used cd racks for there out of print self titiled debut, it's better then anything they have ever put out, no lies."
3,"Good, but needed work to assemble","Overall, this is a good quality stand. There were some issues assembling the stand because only half of the holes were actually pre-drilled. I had to make a template and drill the remaining holes.Up close the stand looks like it could use some work. The vertical portion of the stand is not perfectly square. From a distance they look great. They are stable and work well to support my Polk Monitor 40 speakers."
5,Loved It.,"I thought that this novel was a great overview, if you will, of French politics and the Royal Court at its highest peak right before the collapse. It included both the glittering, fast-paced and devilish life of the royals and royal-hangers-on and that of the poor and struggling lower classes that were subject to the mercy of kings. Laker deftly handled spanning four generations of women without leaving gaps in the story and without really missing a beat. She did a great job of exploring a good portion of France at that time and held me in thrall throughout the book. This was a great read and I look forward to reading some more of her work."
4,"Good album, Recommended!","My favorite song from this album is ** Whisper a Prayer to the Moon ** ~~this one song makes it worthwhile to buy the album! I'd never heard of Eleanor McEvoy until I heard this song played in the 1998 irish movie ""The Nephew,"" which was produced by and co-stars Pierce Brosnan. The rest of the songs on this album are pretty good ~~ ""Trapped Inside"" is catchy. I like Eleanor's album Snapshots slightly better than this album. All in all, her music reminds me of Sinead Lohan and I recommend this album to new fans. I hope she gets some airplay on the radio!"
4,delightful!,"This is by far my favorite Sesame Street album. The songs are not likely to lull anyone to sleep but the lyrics are so loving, tender and unforgetable you will find yourself singing duets with your small fry very often!"
3,"Michael, There Is A Bypass...!","This book is actually not too bad, anyone who really thinks it is blasphemous must really be a curtain twitcher with nothing else to do, probably the same people who picketed Mel 'Jesus Is My Homeboy' Gibson's Passion of The Christ when it was released.The Da Vinci Code, reads like a bad episode of Knight Rider. The characters have no depth and are as stiff as an old gate, even when you solve the puzzle half way through you want to continue, as it is a real page turner, and also to prove yourself right.If you have a few hours to kill at say, an airport, or a beach this is a cracking read. If you are looking for an innovative, outstanding peice of literature, then please do not read this. It is a fun, fast paced book and best not to take it too seriously.It gets three stars as it has a good storyline, albeit let down by characterisation. Not great, but not particularly bad either.Go on, its worth a read."
4,.,"Interesting; I had never read a negative review of anything by Murakami until I glanced over this page. The negative reviews are interesting, and in a way I see their point. Murakami's ""casual"" style is a bit clumsy in Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, (the Hard Boiled chapters especially, it's true), and it's not as exciting or intense as one might hope. But although I'll detract a star for the Hard Boiled half of the book, the End of the World half was captivating. The way the two stories are interwoven, the wonderful, dream-like End of the World segments, and the incredible, bewildering, and understated ending, as well as the sheer imagination injected into each of these elements -- earns the book a solid 4 stars. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
3,Probably deserves a second read for understanding,"I wanted to read the author's newest book but followed others' people's advice in reviews to read start with another piece. For the first third or half of the book I was thoroughly confused. I was better able to enjoy the characters and the strangeness of the story when I stopped trying to understand what was going on. I figured it would all come together in the end. And it did, sort of. Probably this is one of the books that needs to be read more than once to fully appreciate but it the end it just might be worth it."
4,"Harder, yes. That's a good thing? You'll have to judge...","Think Philip K. Dick. A little Jonathan Lethem. A little Jonathan Carroll. But still thoroughly Murakami. In a style most like the Sheep novels by the same author, this one almost seems to slip out of control late in the action, but manages to tidy up better than I expected in the end. The first half and second half seem to have been written at different times, because the transition is not smooth. Other than that, this is a great Murakami book. It's not his very best work, but it's a great place to start if you are a regular Sci-Fi reader, or a magic realist. After that, the gateway to Murakami-dom is wide open..."
2,"Good writing, bland story","Just finished this book and I was left with a feeling of being let down.The writing is very good. I found no problems or inconsistencies with style, form or thought.My problem is with the story itself; it wasn't very interesting. Very little in it grabbed me, very little filled me with a desire to care and read on. After starting slowly and gaining a little momentum, it felt like the series of events that unfolded just limped along to the end.I'm not discounting that this could be an enjoyable read for some. But for me it was anticlimactic and disappointing."
2,Garden of Eden,"This is Hemingway's worst book. It's hard to know if he was going for the ""titillation factor"" or if he was simply this jaded, cynical and without compassion. If ""three ways"" thrill you, this is your Hemingway book; otherwise, it simply illustrates how superficial and careless he could be -- and his writing in this one is pitiful."
2,"First 100 pages are worth reading, may skip the rest",It looks like the second half of the book is compiled by far less skillful writer.
1,never received this order,I think they would have been good... really wish I could have experienced them. They've never arrived.
2,not good,"I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie. The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie. You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart. Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us)."
5,What else is there to say?,"I've been craving oreos for the past week. What better way to satisfy my needs than to order online and have it delivered right to your doorstep?Comes in 12 packs of 6 oreos each, which is perfect for a little snack or to put inside a bag to eat later."
1,Does not work with analog video source,"This product does NOT work as advertised. Do not buy this if you want to capture anything from an analog video source, such as from a VHS VCR. It will skip frames seemingly at random.It does capture nicely from digital sources though such as TiVo or a DVD."
2,same problem as api-500,"yes this unit does wonders when you capture digital video from your dvd player but dont think you can capture analog from your vcr or any other source or analog video tape, maybe if the videos are close to new you might, just migh if your lucky,again dont buy it if your planing on conecting your vcr,youneed to have a TBC unit in the middle, if not your in deep ****and TBC units are 180 to 300 us dollars! wich some body elsehad mention this before"
5,A wonderful example of the Acid Jazz format,"When I first heard this album I discounted it as trite. Two months later while driving to L.A., I put the CD in and listened to every cut. I listened to this album daily for the next three months. This is a monster album, the music is fresh, funny, and lively. If you, like many people, are diverse in your musical taste, you will appreciate, what to me is, the natural evoloution of Jazz. From Bebop to Cool to Modern to Smooth to Acid. I am now loving Acid Jazz to the fullest. Every cut is a killer."
5,Insight,"PG Maxwell Stuart offers a variety of texts concerning the occult that were heretofore unavailable in an English translation. Texts are grouped into categorial chapters and translated into concise modern English. Includes works by authors such as Martin Luther, Newton and Nicodemus."
3,Good campy movie.......,"If you're looking for a movie that's fun in a bad way and that you don't have to take seriously,then this is a good one.If there's a movie that needs to have the MST3K treatment,then it's right here...Bad effects,but then it comes from a guy that did Amazing Colassal Man,so what do you expect?? Good silly fun...."
4,"Good, genuine blues","Alvin is a reasonably competent player and singer who gets a quite authentic old time blues sound here. There's better players and singers in the genre, but who cares, because Alvin's music stands on it's own merit and is definitely worthy of a listen. I've done some research, and Alvin did NOT say what the reviewer directly below seems to believe he said. Racist comments in reviews are not necessary."
1,"Sappy, inaccurate portrayal of infertility","I'd been anxious to read this book because I've had infertility for four years and wanted to see how a fictional character dealt with it. This storyline was such a disappointment. While the author acknowledges that she hasn't experienced infertility, I felt she should have done more research into the actual medicine (i.e., one doesn't just do ICSI standalone, as she suggests). And of course, even here the infertile couple ends up with a happy ending (unlike real life).I felt this book was an insult to couples experiencing infertility.I put this book down with a sour taste in my mouth and a vow to not read any more of this author's work."
3,Dumb woman,"I have enjoyed Delinsky's books for the most part. However in this book, it is very hard to read about Amanda who can't even follow one aspect of her own advice. Just not up to Delinsky's Coast Road, etc."
1,Anything But Soft,This set is anything but soft.The set is also very heavy. Washed several times and never got softer. The only good thing is they are plenty big for a pillow top matress. Not worth the price.
2,600TC sheet set,"This product arrived in what appeared to be good shape, but upon washing became blotchy and discolored in places making them unusable. Very disappointed."
3,review,Book was pretty good and had a lot of optimistic visions for the future of reiki integrating with western medicine. Makes me want to read more about reiki.
5,almost the same as the Swiss Army Climber,"This Climber II pocket knife is exactly the same length and thickness as the Climber. The only difference is the Climber has a Philip screw driver and the Climber II as a cork screw. The Climber is glossy red while the Climber II is flat dark red. You can get the Climber II for less.Both are 9cm in length, 16mm thick and 20mm wide.I couldn't decide which one to buy so I bought both so now you know.Both knives are built really well and last a life time unless you lose it like I did.It's not too big and not too small, it's just right.It weighs a lot less than a leathermen."
4,Excellent knife,"This is a great knife. You have to be extra careful when using it the blades are razor sharp. The only inconvience, if the knife is attached to a key chain the small blade opens towards it. The price is good."
3,different color,"why the pictures show it was bright red, but the real thing is actually very dark.... and the texture is not polished, either"
4,"Handle finish is matte maroon, not glossy red","The handle is matte maroon, not glossy red as on most other Swiss Army Knives. This isn't a functional problem, but I don't like the aesthetics as much. Also the logo on the handle is stamped and painted, rather than inlaid aluminum as on other Swiss Army Knives. Again, it's an aesthetic issue. The size and the tools are identical to the Swiss Army Climber II Knife I bought through Amazon a few months ago. This one with the matte finish was a few dollars cheaper, but the other one included a pinch light (not mentioned in original posting) and the aesthetics were better."
4,"Good product, slightly misleading description","As other reviewers have pointed out, this is the budget version of the Climber with less attractive scales. Unless you know that the ""II"" means ""budget"", or that the budget scales are nylon (I didn't), you'd never get that from the description.The budget version is still an outstanding knife at a price lower than should be possible, and Amazon's discount makes it a screaming deal that I'd recommend without reservation. It would just be nice if the description was a bit more up-front about what you're buying."
1,Poor quality. Disappointed,I bought this as a gift for my son's 8th birthday. It was his first pocketknife and he was so excited. Sadly the quality was not what we expected. After only 4 months of supervised use something inside the knife gave way and now there is a piece of metal sticking out of it and 4 tools/blades won't open at all. Is there any kind of product warranty?Added later:I finally got the tool opened. Looks like the metal piece that acts as a spring on the scissors broke. I was able to remove that part and can now open the other blades but the scissors no longer spring open.
2,"Difficult to follow, poor subtitling.","The main problem with watching the English version of this film is the subtitling. There seems to be quite a bit of innuendo and colloquialism, and the subtitling is extremely literal. I seriously doubt the woman who subtitled the movie speaks any English.The story itself is confusing. We're not sure whether Andrei's is gay or not, or whether he's even having issues with his sexuality."
2,"""Secrets"" nobody cares about","Poundstone's previous books are interesting, but this reads like a collection of out-takes. Who cares about Joan Collins' REAL birthdate? Antiquated, anal-retentive, non-applicable material; the only practical entry (all of 3 pages) is the entry about Lottery tickets and how they work. Should have been a cultural survival manual, but it's mainly nonsense. I wish the author would dig for more significant material; a stale twinkie."
2,Hard to read,There is some good information on dog behavior in this book but the book is very difficult to follow. I have read the Monks' of New Skeet books and German Shepherds Dogs for Dummies. I have read these books more than once and continually refer back to them for training information. I put the Turid Rugraas' book down after reading a few chapters and I doubt I will finish reading it. There are much better books on dog training that are easy to understand and enjoyable to read.
2,Dog training,"Definitely not worth the money. It is a book that is beyond the basic dog training world. The title is very misleading. The author's interpretation of calming signals is somewhat helpful but not for the beginner. I found many dogs especially my own, yawn for other reasons than just trying to calm situations around them. It is not very precise and confusing."
3,On Talking Terms with Dogs,"Interesting, but not very practical. This was an interesting book and revealed some things about dog behaviour and ""language"". While it claimed to show how dogs communicate with each other, it was not explicit enough on how one can communicate with dogs in their language. I find body language can work but it is not necessarily the same body language that dogs use with each other."
3,A simple little book that helps you talk with your dog,"I found this book to be beneficial in helping me understand my dogs' attempts to calm me down, but to me, most of the book was ""filler"". It could have been written as a paper in 2 or 3 pages instead of 37, and I think it was worth paying perhaps $1.00.As another reviewer mentioned, the author's continuous use of the word loose instead of lose drove me bonkers. If you are going to write and have a book published, charge for it, edit it.Having said that it did help me better understand the raw basics of my dogs calming signals, yawning, swerving on walks, eye movements, etc.If the poor editing doesn't bother you and learning a few things about your dog from a 37 page book would be of value to you, then I do recommend it. I was just a little disappointed."
2,Calm dogs equal good dogs,"A light book with some good advice but not a book that should be taken in its entirety as a failsafe ""How to"".Some of the advice is vague and some of the behavioural signals written about are confusing as too are many of the guides."
5,Good little book..,"Bought for fun and learned a thing or two about dog signals and how they communicate, helped me become a better owner trainer."
1,More photos than text,"I suspect many buyers of this book may be intrigued by the words ""calming signals"" and purchase it with the hope it will contain some helpful advice for agressive dogs. If that's you -- don't waste your money on this. The information it contains could be summarized in a paragraph, and if you deleted all the photos in this little booklet, frankly, that's all that would be left. This will be the last book I will purchase online without having viewed a hard copy at a book store first to make sure it's worth it. I can't imagine anyone buying this book, given an opportunity to scan it first and realize that there's nothing there. There are a few tidbits from observing dog body language, but nothing of consequence to help dog owners with challenges. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND: 1) How to be your dog's best friend; and 2) Good Owners, Great Dogs."
5,awesum,if your not into sick humour dont buy this. but if you like your humour to the extreme this is something for you. tom green directed this movie so if u like what he usually does. then yeah. u wil love this.i love it
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!,This is the worst movie I have ever seen.. well partially seen since it's the only movie I have literally walked out of the theater on. I got my money back too. This movie is terrible!! There is no story to it and it's extremely disgusting. Tom Green just goes too far on this one.. it's not funny at all.
1,If you like stupid movies then here it is.,I guess I am one of the lucky ones that decided to rent this so called movie before buying it. I found this movie to be more stupid than funny. If I wanted to watch some dude (Tom Green) play with a horse I would have rented a different movie.
1,My brain hurts,"I want the hour-and-a-half of my life back. This movie was so dumb that it gave me a headache. I realized that the headache came from my IQ slipping a few points. Tom Greene should be arrested for making this movie. The producers should be ashamed of themselves for even entertaining the idea of putting this movie on film. The story was half-written, the acting was horrible, and I still have a headache. Please don't waste your time - make sure to pay your friends NOT to give this movie as a gift."
5,Incredibly funny!,"""Freddie got fingered"" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Its up there with ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" in my opinion. The movie stars TOm Green as GOrd, a crazy 28 year old aspiring animator of bizarre cartoons. Co-starring and stealing every scene he's in is Rip Torn as Jim, Gord's dad who is just as crazy and more violent than his son! The supporting cast is also solid especially Gord's wheelchair-bound girlfriend Betty. But this is really a father-son movie. The funniest scenes are between GOrd and Jim. The movie has a pretty simple plot and a lot of gross but funny scenes. Highly recommended!!"
1,Absolute Trash,I love comedy's but this one is sooooo ridiculous and stupid that it hurts to watch. There is no point to this movie at all. If the producers had picked someone other then Tom Green no one would have seen/liked this movie.
1,Oh god another movie I would never see again.,This had to be one of the worst movies I have seen. I walked away feeling like my brain hurt because the movie was soo gross. I know that a lot of people will say you have to be a Tom Green fan to get it. Well I am a sorta Tom Green fan but this went over the limit with some of the gross stuff in the movie.The only good thing in this movie were some of the actors that were in.
2,I didn't know a movie could be so jumbled.,"I went into this movie hearing that it's not really that good, but I like Tom Green, so I decided to give it a chance. Did I do the wrong thing? Yes. This movie is really bad. Even for fans of the show, it wears a little thin when you enter the hour and a half mark. There were a couple moments where I laughed at the material and other times when I just laughed at how truly bad it was. I understand what Green was trying to accomplish with the story, but I just feel he went about it the wrong way. He was trying to portray the importance of making your parents proud after they raise you, but I don't think you do that by ummm doing ""things"" to animals. You don't want to know what those ""things"" are trust me. In the future I would recommend that Tom stick to acting and let someone else write the movies."
5,An extremely overlooked comic masterfeces,"Yes, its plot and acting was thin. but in a way, it was a revolutionary movie. because it KNEW that it's plot was thin. It KNEW that the acting was bad. It KNEW that having Tom Green swing a dead baby around the room by it's umbilical cord would make people question their own ethics for seeing it. Thats why it was so wonderful. The film make so little sense, that it bordered on genius. The whole thing was so absurd, that I turned around to see other's reactions. EVERYONE in the theatre had this ""What the heck is this?!"" look on their face. Im sure they all hated the movie. And that... is why I loved it. call me unintelligent, but if you look at the movie as a ethic breaker, you may agree. So many recent gross-out comedies have completely missed what they were striving to do. This, is what they were striving to do. Watch with open mind."
1,Makes You Want to Hunt Him Down,"This is the worst, most maddening movie I've ever seen. I heard Tom Green in an interview in San Francisco, complaining that Drew Barrymore divorced him after this movie. After seeing this useless waste of time, I'm surprised she didn't put a contract out on him, or at least sue him for defamation of character for simply being associated with her. Tom Green is an utter loser, mean-spirited, and so annoying he has you looking for a baseball bat in the first 30 seconds of this movie. You just wish the Earth would swallow him up in a fiery, searing poof. Or that he would perform his own death-defying stunts and screw up. Or fall into a running wood chipper. Or just go away."
1,Is This What America Media Has Come To?,"Is this really what our media is coming to? I can't imagine a movie more terrible than this one. People say that it's funny. It's not. It's perverted, to the extreme. The acting is bad, the storyline simple. What this guy does is absolutely gut wrenching. I have no idea how warped a person's sense of humor needs to be before they think swinging a baby by the umbilical cord in a hospital room is funny. I personally don't laugh at being offended. Granted, the movie does do what it was meant to accomplish. It will offend you. You will be blasted with profanity throughout the entire movie and with a relentless fear of how bad the next scene will be. Designed to attract teens, it does so, but the message it teaches is so wrong (in anyone's viewpoint, really) that it even pushes most of them away.If you laugh at offense, you'd better bring Kleenex to wipe away the tears. It's a shame something like this actually made it to the theatre."
1,WARNING:This is the most retarded movie ever made,I watched it a quarter of the way threw and shut it off. Filled with cheesey effects and horrid humor.This is a sleeper.
4,"PRetty good, Tom Green brings the enitre movie out!","Alough many people on here complae about it,,, ITs more of a movie that a 17 or a 18 year old would like the comady is more on the teen/young adult leval. And I do agree the movie wouldent even be close to the movie if Tom Green I mean think of it with someone like Jim CArry takeing his place or Andy Dick? Well Andy Dick would probly pull it off but No one on earth can replace Tom Green and what he does. Rent it, if you like it buy it, if you hate it go abck to Blockbuster and demand your money back (if they still have that garente deal thing still going)The Specail fueaturesare great The Deleted Sceans are he best ive seen in movies in a while......"
1,where is PETA?,Peta should have this idiot arrested. He molests animals and it made me sick. and it IS NOT FUNNY. anyone who is into beastiality really really needs mental help. tom green should be in jail.
5,Get Fingered,"This movie has changed my life. Was it for the better you wonder? Yes it was. Although, if your life has been going pretty well so far and you don't have a crazy need for ridiculous humor you may feel different. I know every word to this movie if that tells you anything. I love Tom Green!!!! Buy this movie right now and turn your life around!"
1,One of the worst movies of all time.,"I'm noticing that only about 16 people reviewed this film and I have a theory about this: they were embarrassed to say they rented it. I feel your pain as well. This is easily one of the worst movies of all time. I think Tom Green has mastered this skill well; that is, making terrible movies.I was going to make this longer, but I don't think I really need to."
1,the pits,"The problem with saying that this movie features [strange] scenes and offensive, politically incorrect humor is that people may like funny movies that contain these elements. I enjoyed Kingpin and Something About Mary, truly funny movies that had [strange] or insensitive sequences. So, a review that focuses on the [strange] and offensive may entice some potential viewer to see the film. ... It is just unbelievably unfunny. Tom Green's little skits on TV were amusing but this movie is just so [weak], NOT because he portrays umbilical cords and bodily fluids, but because the writing is [weak], the acting is [weak], and the direction is [weak]. It is not funny. Don't let your curiosity get the better of you because you'll be completely, massively disappointed. ..."
5,IT'S A TREASURE !!!!!,"First of all ! I'm an animator, so watching this movie made me follow each part of it soooo carefully !! I can say that I match the character and what he had in his life with me :) really !!!!! quitting his job, people complaining of what he does ! I mean being an animator !! AND THE BIG ONE MATCHES ME is that his brother is a Banker !!!!! I had this chance to be a banker but I left it to become an animator !!!! and much much more from Gord Brody's life in this AMAZING movie ... I can say that this movie ... is a treasure .. it has advices it has many great things you learn from mixed with comedian sense !!!! It's my BEST MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!"
3,A Curious London subculture,"Kureishi, who is also responsible for My Beautiful Launderette, provides a window on Pakistanis in London a couple of decades ago. It is wildly funny, with over the top takes on multiculturalism, the punk music scene, and the coming of age of its protagonist Daniel, half Pakistani, half English, and not really either one."
5,What a 'Live' album should be.,"Poco's ""DeLIVErin"" is what a live album should be. From the opening song,""I guess you made it"" to ""A man like Me"" to the ending ""Consequently so Long"" the energy is here, and what energy it is. The music is heart thumping, hand clapping, good time country rock and roll. Also included here is Richie Furay's classic ""Kind Women"". All who love country-rock should have this collection of tunes in their CD player."
3,looks like After the Gold Rush,"I have read 'After the Gold Rush'.Checking out the index of Professional Software Development: Shorter Schedules, Higher Quality Products, More Successful Projects, Enhanced Careers reminds me very much of that book.I am rather afraid that it is just a second edition of 'After the Gold Rush' which prevented me from buying this one."
1,It does not seem a McConnell book,"I totally agree with the 1-3 star reviews. I have read Code Complete and Software Estimation, and this book does not have the same level.Although the book does not deserve a 1 star, I also think that the average rating is too high."
2,Very Hard to Finish...,"I am by no means the well-read expert on the subject of spirituality. I am searching and always open to a good book discussing the topic. This book was totally lost on me. I found it to be mundane and it seemed to be pointless. It treated most of the topics (see the table of contents link) from a schoolbook theoretical view, offering me no practical knowledge.For better reading, I would refer the reader to Carol Adrienne's ""The Purpose of Your Life"" or James Redfield's ""The Celestine Prophecy"" (a novel).It is probably worth noting that ""The Seat of the Soul"" was a national bestseller (according to the cover) but I for one will not find it a memorable book."
1,New Age Fluff,"I'm afraid this review is going to generate a lot of negative Karma. I couln't buy Zukov's description of an apparently new religion. He treats his subject as if it is established fact rather than the fanciful theory that it is. It would have helped if he could have supported his premises with some real life experiences or better yet shown how great thinkers might have supported his ideas. What one reviewer called a poetic writing style, I found redundant and ponderous. I'm sorry but I'm not ready to pray for the dolphin soul in order to lift them to a higher state of consciousness."
2,Seal of the Soul,"Again, same order, same disappointment in'time to receive...believed it was offered to bereceived quickly...not happy with content, either.h"
4,wow!,"I agree with some of the reviews that the absolute of his writing may turn people off, however, if you can look past that aspect of his writing you will gain much insight from this book. Even if you are far from a new age thinker. Many of what was addressed makes sense, his approuch has helped me see things differently, a more freeing feeling. I see his intentions as helping create positive in all of us, how could his efforts be criticized. His absoluteness, I believe, is his Faith. Read with an open mind and absorb his message."
1,Falsely Represented,"After Oprahs show I couldn't wait to get the book! Was suprised that it was about reincarnation. I felt on Oprahs show that Mr. Zukav falsely represented what the book was actually about, by failing to mention the jist of what the book is truly about. I was very disappointed and unhappy with my waste of money."
2,"a nice message, but kind of boring","I enjoyed the main messages from the book. However, the book just did not excite me. I had a hard time sticking with it, as it became kind of boring. It seemed to offer a lot of ""cotton candy"" philosophy, but little concrete examples to help me apply it to my everyday life."
3,"nuggets of wisdom, too many theories","I really liked his fundamental idea and the description of growth and development possible and its way. This part was much too short for me and did not go into sufficient depth and descriptiveness. I felt like he had started to write something truly interesting and then did not flesh it out.I really disliked his theories about ""group souls"" ""souls being only partially present in the specific person"" and so on. Not because I disagree with him (I have no idea whether animals have group souls and whether I have a 1/158 of a soul or more or less) but because he just says ""this is how it is"" and does not explain why he thinks that and where he gets it from. If he did explain, I might find myself agreeing with him (who knows?) but I find such theories without explanations very irritating."
1,"Laughable, at best...","If this is the best that Harvard can come up with we're in big trouble. The infatuation with Eistein's theory of relativity applied to social and ""spiritual"" thought has got to stop! Nothing more than clever writing utilizing unfounded assumptions to mask preconceived notions. For example, if you don't smoke, don't drink and never had a sexual urge you'll find a lot of support for the arrogance and superiority complex of your highly evolved little self. The idea that the highest human value is to ""value others above yourself"" is the root of every misery known to man (& woman), and that marriage, monogamy and fidelity are the state of the ""highly evolved""--let's see, was Jesus Christ married? Or, Oprah? Or, who DOES run ""Promise Keepers"" anyway? I read 3-5 books a week, and I'm a writer. Even a neophyte Taoist would find this book laughable, at best. One of the few books I'm sorry I wasted a few bucks on..."
2,Theoretical gobbledy-gook. Boring too.,"I watch Oprah, read self-help books, love animals and people and have done a lot of soul searching. But this book can put me to sleep better than any college text book I ever read. I can't get myself to pick it back up to finish it."
2,"Zukav struck gold by capturing Oprah's ""soul"" and publicity","O.K.....we all know there are hundreds of books on the market that ""delve into your soul""....well, after Oprah's HUGE push for this book, I bought it thinking there simply MUST be some magical thing about this book. What I found page after page after page was simply one mans ideas and explanations for our existence. I would read a sentence referring to the ""guides and teachers"" that would help our souls review our lives (after our death of course) and would think ""Now how does Zukav know this?"" You could ask yourself this question after every single sentence in the book. This book is very simply ONE MAN'S ASSUMPTIONS OF OUR LIVES, OUR SOULS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. Unless Zukav talked to a burning bush on a mountain one day........this is a work of fiction, nothing more."
5,"a connection: Zukav's ""new Species"" and Native Americans","This book is an amazing piece of work for me as a Native American to read, in that it is so similar to many Native religions. However, we would make some division between soul and spirit, to me, Mr. Zukav has actually accomplished a non Indian translation of some very basic Aboriginal concepts. I would suggest therefore, that when he speaks of a ""new species"" he may really mean the oldest of cultures, those who sought connection to the spirit and took responsibility for their thoughts and actions-Aboriginal people."
5,"An ""ah-ha"" moment on every page","This is the type of book that you read and want to highlight every word or take notes in every paragraph. My favorite part of the work is when Gary speaks of the soul as your mothership and how if we are not following our mothership on this earth (the earth school) then our heart will die a little every day (paraphrasing of course). I could literally tweet daily for a full year with all of the excellent thoughts in this book. I recommend this book to all of my clients, family and friends with no hesitation. I love that he approaches the soul in a secular yet extremely sincere voice.Rhonda Hale Warren"
3,Great philosophy but .....,"I appreciated much of Zukav's philosophy - it was in accord with my own views in lots of ways, but it was also illuminating and refining in other ways.What I didn't like about the book was the - well, what was it, religion? that he used to justify his views. It kept reminding me that there are people out there who believe 'Lord of the Rings' actually happened, or 'Star Wars'. (And I don't know enough about L Ron Hubbard to know if there are parallels there too.)For me belief is an extremely personal thing - something we must all sort out for ourselves. What Mr Zukav describes to justify his philosophy (as if good ideas ever needed justification!) is simply no part of what I believe and I can't see it becoming so."
5,PROFOUND,"This book explained many of the concepts I have known but never had the glue to put it all together before. Its made me realize why I've been going through the last 3.5 years of things blowing up in my face. I know this book isn't for everyone, but if you've been going through a tough time and NOTHING seems to be working, this may be the help you need. With me, I've known that fear was at the seat of my problem, but couldn't get beyond it without more understanding. Fear, and the many forms of it (hatred, anger, greed, jealousy, etc.) are discussed in depth. This book opened my mind, helped me accept what's going on and why its been going on. I now feel I'm able to more forward with new tools."
3,Rereading essential to grasp some of Zukav's thoughts.,"I have just finished reading ""Seat of the Soul"" or should I say I read it at least twice to finish it. I found myself reading some passages over and over again to grasp some of Zukav's insights. In reading the passages I needed to ask myself what is the author trying to tell us as he also repeated himself for emphasis on numerous occasions. I think the author should be commended for his attempt at putting together a ""manual"" on human spirituality but he does broaden the field to the animal soul, reincarnation, extra terrestrial life and I believe his creativity places the reader in some difficulty to comprehend the whole of the work. I expected more so I'm a little disappointed."
2,Book,"If Christianity was chocolate, and Hinduism was peanut butter, then Gary Zukav has just invented the peanut butter cup."
2,Spiritual Twinkie,"I have to agree with the others who have panned this book. The only reason I give it more than one star is that it at least ""explores"" an area that every soul should eventually consider. Someone who finds Mr. Zukav profound or original may know how to read, but, in this area at least, has yet to read much worth reading."
3,new age?,"New age does not mean ""non-christian"". Did you ever listen to new age music? It often has a Christian background!"
1,Writes in Riddles,"Zukav pretends he is authority on some special insight into the way things ought to be. However, his credentials are limited. The words he uses in many of his sentences are confusing and contradictory as to attempt to provide different meanings to different people. Thus, unless one is a dolt who reads between the lines to gain some abstruse meaning, this book, as literally written, is a piece of trash."
1,"It's not science, it's not philosophy, and it's not true.","What's there to say? The book merrily takes for granted the truth of various New Age claims, most deeply, the existence of the soul. Meanwhile, in the centuries since Descarte's ill-fated dualism, science has understood that the mind exists as the computations of the brain, not as some sort of magical soul-essence.Why waste your time here? Zukov tries hard to paint a cheery picture of a comfortable world where humans are special, but does it at the expense of the rationality that distinguishes us. For a better understanding of what you are, try Steven Pinker's ""How The Mind Works"" or Daniel Dennett's ""Consciousness Explained""."
1,out of stock? take my copy!,"I agree with the two reviewers who decry the complete lack of substantiation for Zukav's half-baked theories.When Zukarov said people have individual souls but animals only have one ""collective"" soul -- all dogs share one ""dog soul"" -- I knew the guy was crazy.Maybe I'll just burn my copy lest some poor fool becomes a convert to this delusional man's new 'religion' or whatever you call his way of life, promoted at his website. I'm no censor, but I could, free of conscience, take this one out of circulation."
2,A big disappointment after Wu Li,"I recommend Zukav's first book, the Wu Li Dancing Masters on my website. I was eagerly looking forward to a continuation. I expected it to be about what we have learned about the soul and consciousness. Instead, he concocted an ecumenical soup of new age beliefs from astrology to reincarnation and wove it into an elaborate metaphysic, fluffed up with abstract words like ""negativity"", ""learning"" and ""frequency"". It is a merangue -- no substance, no backing, no examples, no reasons for why anything he conjectures is true, and no way to apply it practically.It reads like a channeled hynotic trance induction. It sounds good but says little.He explains that you should not think it unfair to see someone homeless and that humans are superior to dolphins even in a soul sense. This is a self-indulgent book, where Mr. Zukav treats his every intuition as divine revelation."
1,The Seat of the Soul,"An acquaintance of mine gave me ""The Seat of the Soul"" with high praises. To accord any praise at all for this book is much more than I can consciously offer. The author presents a theory as if he were the sole owner of all that is in his book of ""wisdom."" There is absolutely no acknowledgement of others who have explored the nature of soul. No documentation and no definition of what appears to be one of the author's central points, the ""authentic personality.""Having said all this, let me say that I have no problem with much of what the author propounds in this book. It is his notion of the ""multisensory"" person whose soul is guided by its soul-force ranging for generations back in history that leaves me at a bus stop waving goodbye; and wondering why I ever got on the bus in the first place!"
1,"Pontificating style, told as if it's all substantiated fact!","Zukav is obviously very impressed with Zukav. This book has no spine, not supported with facts but told as if it has all been substantiated."
1,You Must Be Kidding!,"Having been a student of metaphysics for years, I'm amazed at the success of this book because it is merely a rehash of very old ideas--without their original complexity. This book should be subtitled: *Everything I Know I Learned from Plato* (most especially the dialogue titled *Phaedrus* There's absolutely nothing ""new"" about this ""New Age"" tome. A visit to Zukav's website may also give one the impression this is about making money, not helping souls. Hmmmm . . . ."
1,For True Believers Mainly,"I read a great deal: nonfiction, fiction, history, art, religion,philosophy. I've completed masters degrees in computer science and business administration. I even scored 760 on the verbal section of the SAT. I'm not interested in bragging ('cause who cares anyway?) but saying I'm not exactly illiterate or unfamiliar with struggling with unusual concepts. Yet entire paragraphs would go by without any real comprehension on my part or acceptance either. For all his mild-mannered appearance, Zukav is telling us the way the world is according to Zukav and either you ""get it"" or you don't. He lays down the law, the truth, and you believe because he says so. Sorry, really, I want to understand but in my heart I believe Zukav is either insane or conning us. God bless you if you accept him. I don't."
4,Excellent Villa Lobos Etudes,Compared to Barrueco and Kraft I prefer this CD. The tempo chosen for the different etudes is lifting the music to a new dimension. The rich quality of the music comes out more beautiful then ever. The ginastera piece is not really my music so that's why I give it a four star instead of a five.
2,Amanda Cross in poor form,"I hadn't read an Amanda Cross mystery in years, but I remember being fond of her feminist academic Kate Fansler, so I gave this one a try. I'm sad to say that this one is way off form. The plot is contrived in order to conform to a group of Shakespearean quotations - a conceit that has been far better by other writers - and although it is somewhat convoluted even I, who am generally not one to figure things out before the author explains, was able to see what was coming a mile away.Further, I have to say that the character development was wooden, the mechanism of the plot was creaky, the dialog stilted. I did enjoy some of the academic overtones, but that probably isn't enough to give this one a recommendation.Scott Morrison"
3,well written but disapponting,"I have read all of the previous Kate Fansler novels so looked forward to this one. Alas, the prose is stiff and formal while the plot barely moves from page to page.The converstaion is so perfect, almost literary. Perhaps there are people who speak like this everyday but it does not make for exciting reading. I appreciate good writing and well edited books but this one comes across more like emotionless non-fiction."
2,'The Weakness' in the Animorphs series,"Unlike most people who have reviewed this book, I don't think Animorphs is getting worse. But this book was definetly bad. It was just the same old thing over and over again, action, action who cares? It did have a few good parts though. The ending was good and a big improvement on the rest of the book. It also showed you what happens when Rachel gets out of control, but didn't we already see that in #32? One thing I did like about this book was the cover."
2,Disappointred,"Having read all the Sharpe novels, I was excited to watch the DVDs. Not knowing how they were going to be, I ordered a few and just watched the first one. Sharpe's Rifles. Where do I start? The acting is horrible. Sean Bean and the writers catch none of Sharpe's personality. The battle scenes which were small ones in this story were terrible. They looked like what you'd see in a high school stage production. I don't even know what to say about Wellington except that was not a good portrayal. Sgt Harper is off by about 6 inches and 100 lbs. Did I mention how flat Sean Bean is? It needs to be mentioned twice. I hope the others are better. Thankfully I started with only 3."
4,"An old fashioned swashbuckler, but still enjoyable","I first saw Sharpe's Rifles on the local Public TV station and enjoyed it. The film does NOT follow the book by Bernard Cornwell, but don't let this stop you. There's plenty of sword play and shooting in all of the Sharpe films. The costumes, uniforms and weaponry are quite good, although sharp (no pun intended) history buffs will spot inaccuracies. Sean Bean captured the part in the first episode and made it his and Darragh O'Malley is the definative ""Srgt. Harper""."
4,Good anime with a killer story line(so far),A good mix of hot babes and action with a little bit of drama. A little bit for every one!!
1,Does not do incremental backups,"Began failing on incremental backups in September of 2005 (at OS version 10.3.?), worked before that. Also fails on 10.4.0-10.4.6. Always gives the same error message - indicating a programming error. Prosoft has offered no help after many attempts over a 9 month period."
2,No blue sheen,"I had no clue what a ""double thick"" colar was. It was just quite literally twice as thick. I'm not sure why you want that, but it didn't bother me. What did bother me is that in the picture it has a lovely blue sheen. When I got it it was just lavender. I was disappointed and ended up returning it."
4,Good Book!,"When I read the first sentence in this book, I automatically had a good feeling about it. Many people had described it as haunting, and it was. The protagonist was calculating and manipulative, yet eerily likable. The double narration through the third person of the author and the journal of one of the characters was very effective adding depth and intensity to the plot. I really enjoyed this book though I wanted more from the ending. It was an easy read and a great original story."
1,The ending was no better than the beginning,"I read it cover to cover just hoping it would get better, it didn't. The style and direction that the author appeared to be taking really held a lot of promise; this could have been a great book. Instead it was mostly choppy, at times disjointed and didn't leave you wanting to return to any of the trite players once you thought you might have escaped their prosaic lives. Disappointingly two-dimensional, there were relationships that needed to be explored, but weren't and characters that could have been developed but were left as props for this banal show of middle class anti-society angst."
2,Slow Read - Low Action,"The book is well written and it certainly is a dark and compelling story. However, very little actually happens in the story. There is almost no action in the book. It is basically 200 pages of mood setting. The author spends most of the text describing the mindset and thoughts of the characters and very little text to the actual events. I prefer reading the story as it unfolds rather that the more cerebral approach of solely getting into the heads and moods of the characters. I kept wanting him to get to the point - which he never really got around to."
4,Pond Lite,"Not quite as energetic as their first release and not quite as daring/expiramental as their second. It's saving moments, however, are contained in such songs as ""Spokes"" and the very lovely ending to an otherwise staightforward song in ""Flawed"", proving that singer-songwriters Chris Brady and Charlie Campbell are a duo to contend with. The slide guitar is haunting and the harmonies harken back to their first album."
3,Don't get this book if you're looking for instructions,"The pictures in this book are beautiful, but I will probably be reselling it on Amazon because it is just like looking at a coffee table book. Once through, and you're done. There are so few really good polymer clay books (The Art of Polymer Clay being one of them), and this one is not one of them. The photography is impressive, the designs are beautiful and innovative, but if you're looking for a book that teaches you something - forget it. This isn't it!"
4,International Insight on Industry,"More than just a look at Ford v. Nissan, ""The Reckoning"" gives some perspective on the fundamental differences between how the US and Japan approached industries vital to the economic health of their respective nations. A solid lesson in how arrogance and complacency can lead to mediocrity, opening the door for new industry champions."
5,Must read for any automotive enthusiast or professional in the industry,"Classic, must-read, definitive work on the history of the automotive industry... very relevant today. Buy two, give one away!"
3,Whoops!,"As always with David Halberstam, this book is a monument to relentless reporting - he must surely be the most energetic reporter of our times. It presents vivid pictures of the insides of Ford and Nissan, with an eye toward developing his main theme: that America really blew it, that the Japanese are gonna take over, that the American economy is going down the tubes. Too bad that entire theme is ridiculously wrong. The book came out in 1986, just as the American economy was gearing up to reinvent itself, as it had many times before, and as it will many times again. As a history of the car industry, the book is dandy; as another of Halberstam's attempts to explain the world, it's an exercise in hubris."
3,Funny But Too Short for a Boxed Set,"This boxed set could have all been on one DVD and save me some storage space and money. The entire 3 DVD set is 2:30. Volume 1 contains 2 shows from the original Def Jam in 1992 and 1993 hosted by Martin Lawrence. There were some hilarious moments and some funny moments. It brought back great memories of the early 90s. Volume 2, hosted by Steve Harvey was okay and also only contained 2 shows. Both Vol. 1 and 2 are available separately so Vol. 3 is a bonus and therefore only contains 1 show. I was expecting 5 or 6 hours of material since it was broken into 3 DVDs. What was I thinking?"
5,awesome ride...,"tommy lee really shows his talents in this cd. i got it from a friend, and i became addicted to it....its really great from the lyrics to the collaborations.no matter what, when im listening to this cd im always having a ""good time""..."
5,Tommy Lee...The Ride Is AWESOME!!!,"This CD is incredible. Not often do you find one that every track is good and never skip past anything. The mix of rock ballads and some harder tracks keep this disc spinning all the time. Guest vocals are top notch and content (if you are paying attention) is a riot, even the Butler is funny. Would have liked to see more contributing info on the jacket/liner cause trying to figure out who is singing on Makin me Crazy almost drove me crazy but well worth it! I am thinking about going out and buying 3 more copies (one for home, one for the office, and one for my kid who keeps stealing mine) because it never leaves the CD player in the car! Tommy...way to keep us rockin!"
3,what's with the F words?,"i'd like to give this disc a better review, but the best song on the cd, tired, has a huge beep editing out an F word about 22 seconds in!!! what's the point? either change the word or use a different type of censor. it ruins the track completely. track five ""the butler"" and six ""tired"" have this nuisance. either put out two versions of the disc (one edited and one not) or just let the word happen. geeez! i had a download of the entire album, but figured the original disc wouldn't be edited. my mistake. i could've used that eight dollars on blank discs... i looked all over the internet for some mention of the disc being edited or censored, but couldn't find anything, and that's why i decided to write this review."
5,I Love this album!!!,"I think this is some of Tommy's best work to date. If you like Tommy Lee, you need to buy this CD! I have to say my favorite songs on the CD are ""Good Times"", ""Tired"", ""Say Goodbye"", and ""Hello Again"" (acoustic version). Tommy lays it all on the line on this CD. Check it out!!!"
5,Some Things Are Better With Age,"Tommy Lee has always been an all out rock god who wasn't afraid to do the wild and unusual. This album is a clear example of that. While it is a little more mellow than expected from the drummer of such a notorious band as Motley Crue, the songs are fantastic, and speak with a lot of depth and talent, while implying a lack of caring about what the industry wants, and being true to himself. Some are catchy and leave you humming them all day, while others inspire you to sing along. Some of the songs are just plain fun, and others touch you emotionally. In all, I thought the album was well worth the buy, and I don't think any true rock collection is complete without it."
2,Very Dry - written more like a textbook,"I did read the entire book. I was waiting for it to become more exciting and interesting. That didn't happen, and it is a slow read. I would not recommend this. You may enjoy 'First you Fall' by Scott Sherman instead."
3,not a favorite...........lacks something,The story would have been so much better if Molly wouldn't have let her ex run all over her. It spoiled the book. Weak women are not appealing to me. I'd rather them be fighters. Not so in this story.
3,"Good, but has weak points","It's a bit outdated now (US helping Sudan and not bombing it...), but possible in early 90s. I found annoying that aouthor explains military terms (I know what SAM stands for and probably anybody else who reads military books). Maybe it lacks Israeli intervention, as they would surely have some part in it."
2,This book was slow to get through. Not like his other books.,"I enjoy Harold Coyle. He is my favorite author but I have to admit this book was slow and dreadful. He tried to be a Tom Clancy and failed. It took me 2 full years to finish it(usually 2 days). If you buy a book on size alone than this one is the one to buy other than that, leave this one on the shelf and pick Team Yankee, Sword Point or any of his other Awesome books. This is his only slip up out of all the books."
1,"racist, socialist nonsense","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Beatty, a wealthy playboy, tries to paint all whites as willingly racist and stepping on the poor, while at the same time demonstrating anti-semitism. Nice divisive garbage, Beatty. Not funny. Not relevant or at all honest."
5,hilarious,A very different comedy and a stellar performance by Warren Beatty. Never have enjoyed a movie this much!
2,So what?,"Middling political satire about a burned out US Senator who takes a contract out on himself and as a result suddenly feels free to say what he really thinks as he campaigns for reelection. As he does so he begins to feel liberated and regrets the contract. Interesting premise generally falls pretty flat and has an ending that is easily predictable one hour before it happens. The film contains a few funny moments, but unless hearing Warren Beatty rapping over and over is your idea of fun, you can skip this one."
3,Could be something if we only knew what it was,"I watched this film,and it seems unclear. You have this senator who puts out a hit on his self. Then tries to changes it. He goes around and raps and take up African American mannerisms. What is his point? Now, I can see that he is tired of his life and the way it's going,but what does it have to do with getting with African Americans? The best part of the picture is when Beatty dogs out these LAPD, and this little kid remarks how this is the best thing he ever saw in his whole life, and he's no more than eight or nine. Imagine that. This could have been a great film if only you knew what it was."
4,The best political movie of the last 20 years.,"This movie seemed to disappear from theaters before anybody had a chance to see it, which hardly surprises since it is the best political movie made in America in twenty years. Warren Beatty has earned himself cult hero status by putting his money where his mouth is, while also biting a good chunk out of the hand that would feed him. An exhillerating, dead-on critique of our political wasteland, and the media's complicity in promoting a brain-dead electorate. As good as Preston Sturges at his most iconoclastic. It's a crying shame that critics failed to support this film. Mr. Beatty has, evidently, the only set of balls in hollywood. Thank goodness he's rich and radical. Rent the video."
3,Halle Berry is Hot,"Halle Berry was the only saving grace of this movie for me - she was hot! Overall, it was very contrived and not as funny as I expected. The actors who portrayed Bulworth's campaign mangers were really good, but otherwise most of the performances were lackluster in my opinion."
1,Terrible,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I have seen some bad movies, but this one takes the cake. from the start you know you got yourself a terrible movie. Then you wait till something good happens, and you wait and you wait...nothing. It just gets worse. My advise..stay as far away from this one as you can"
2,Hmmmm...,"This was pretty annoying. The movie started off great. The first 20 minutes or so are funny, satirical, and to the point.The rest of the material is ridiculous. It feels like the writers had a great idea and had no clue how to develop it or what to do with it. I like Warren Beatty and Halle Barry, but this was a low point for both. The worst thing about this movie is that if you saw the ads and trailers, you saw all the good parts already."
1,Breathtakingly awful,"This movie left me and the rest of our household speechless. It is the story of a corrupt man who has lost all sense of balance and goes insane. He uses his political position to make speeches about corruption, generalizing his own lack of decency to other politicians. The movie shows him gaining acceptance in a depraved underworld of filthy-mouthed criminals equally lacking in values and social conscience. He falls in love with a hired assassin. I knew from the beginning that the movie would be a braindead social commentary, but I quickly switched to sympathy for Warren Beatty that he has degenerated from a legitimate actor to a director glorifying mentally unstable people."
5,The Class of '43!,"Documentary covering New York City, through the eyes and memories of New Eutrich High School Reunion Attendess, and names like Mario Cumo, Joe Franklin, Pete Hamill, and others.Everything from street games, to Professional games at three ball parks (representing the best in Baseball), to movies, music, radio, is brought back mostly through black and white clips, some from the media, some from the folks.As a New Jersey-born guy, I can say alot of New York filtred over to West New York, to Hoboken, to Weehawken. The population was not as diverse and the excitement level was lower, but many of us worked in New York, or had friends and relatives there. There was something about it.This VHS tape much of the production values of Ken Burns' documentaries and it is tastefully done."
5,Mollie Katzen is the Best,"This is a wonderful book, as is it's ""sequel"", Honest Pretzel, and all the books by Mollie Katzen (we have several). The recipes are delicious and the book is fun to look through, for the great food descriptions, gorgeous pictures, and quotes from kids who made the food. My brother, who's five and loves to cook, loves it, as does the rest of the family."
1,the lost world why you shoud read the book!,there are great books and there are great films the book is one of the best adventure stories you will ever read the film is not crying out for a screenplay and script simpathetic to the authors masterpiece the (film) gets very little right although it does put the actors into period costume forgiving some of the film and giving it a fair bit of artistic licence the latter part of the film is absolute rubbish an opportunity lost please read the book
3,If it WAS Widescreen I might have been worth the price.,"The word Widescreen is used to promote this two DVD set.It's all over the packaging as an exclusive feature of this edition.Too bad they forgot to tell the people producing the DVD not to pan and scan the film. If I wanted a panned and scannned version I could have taped it off A & E when they broadcast it.This is an overpriced,falsely advertised, rip-off."
5,Fanstic,I got Franco De Vita's new cd in walmart over the weekend for 9.72 on sale and let me tell you that I love it. I had only heard 2 songs before I bought the cd so I was not expecting much but its fanstic. I aslo want to get the cd before this one because he had a hit song or 2. When I get that one I will also rate it. Thank you.
2,not well designed,"It works, but not as well as it could. A simple fact about the front leg structure of a cat is that their shoulder blades rise and fall as they walk - this harness unfortunately locates the small top plastic part right in line with their shoulder blades and appears rather uncomfortable for our cat. Not the greatest product I've purchased from amazon, that's for sure."
3,"It was good , But it need a little help with the story line.","I felt that the book over all was ok, but I did not feel that the story line was realistic. I also felt that there were certain flaws in some of the supposed factual information."
3,"Great beginning, but it fizzles in the end.","Robert Sheckley did a wonder job of building up the story to the point where you begin to care about the charecters. The problem is that this book had the worst ending in the long, sad history of bad endings. I was ready for this to be the best of the aliens series, but the ending took out most of the feeling out of the story. There are just too many loose ends that should have been tied. Nice try."
5,What a deal !,"Very high quality for the price, excellent value for the length, works great for studio application and it is heavy duty"
1,SHARP AQUOS,"DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR, put your wallet away. 3 months into my ownership the sound card gave up, that was on Dec. 10th. today is Jan. 11th. and nobody at SHARP or their local ( pardon the expression ) service vendor, can tell me when I will have the unit back. Dear God buy from some other manufacturer."
3,"I'm not a ""completist""","My review is not about the story, it's about this facsimile edition. The Amazon.com Review mentions this is for the Tintin completist and I wish I'd payed attention to that before I purchased this edition. I used to read these books to my children when they were little and this book didn't look or feel like the ones I used to read. It is longer and there are noticeable differences in names and places, but what I missed the most was: COLOR! This black-and-white edition just didn't do it for me."
1,This book could have been better,Cigars of the Pharaoh is not very interesting. Most of the Tintin books are very interesting and there is a lot of humor and adventure. This book lacks both humor and adventure.It gets really boring in the middle. It would have been a lot better if it was not so dull.
4,As stated,This item is great. You get what you pay for. I have had no trouble with it at all. I would buy it again.
3,A good read but an annoying character,"The main character here, Michael is a egocentric Californiacated yuppie with a lack of observation of others that is truly remarkable in someone over the age of 16. He has been rated as a trainer by Hegel who runs his training house more like a dating service than anything else and Michaels lack of training eventually leads to Chris' proposal in The Archenemy. It is also our first sight of Anderson another of the series major players. I find Michael's character rather off-putting but this is still a good read. I would give it 3.5 but the system doesn't allow for that.Unlike some standard erotic fiction these books by Laura Antoniou have plots, humor and good character development with interesting characters."
4,Starting the 40 Days,"I just started this book, and it seems promising. I can tell that the author tends to focus a bit too much on her own life, but I can relate to the emotional breakdown that she wrote about in the introduction...as long as you can get past that. I'm reading this along w/ A History of God by Karen Armstrong, and during my own faith-questioning journey. Together, these book are great for me. I think 40 Days and 40 Nights goes well w/ any book about religion and theology. It reminds you that only you can determine what is truth to you, and you can view the other matierial w/ an open mind, not committing yourself to believing everything the author has to say. ...So to sum up all this babble...Vanzant's book is very good for those questioning their faith, or on some other spiritual journey."
5,This book opened up my eyes and my heart .,"This book is so spiritual and so deep I had to tell my friends and family about this book. I feel every woman should read this book because, something in this book will relate to something that occurred in there past. Read this book it is very uplifting, postive and true."
2,"Buy it used, if you must!","I'm not sure what annoyed me most about this book. The plot holes you could drive a truck through. The plot devices you can see coming a mile away. The heroine who needs intensive therapy to get over her need to kick the ass of every man she meets. The alien world you learn next to nothing about, despite the fact that three of the main characters are aliens. Characters who seem entirely one dimensional.Actually, I'll have to go with that last one. The heroine, Mia Snow, doesn't seem to really connect with anyone in this book, including the hunky alien love interest, and neither do we as readers. If the characters are strong enough, I can over look a lot of problems with a book (say, items 1-4 cited above), but this book is populated by crudely drawn stereotypes I couldn't bring myself to really like. I won't be buying the sequel, just because I don't really care what happens to these people.If you must read this book, buy it used or borrow it."
2,Interesting ideas badly written,"I read around a third of this book before I finally gave up. It has some interesting ideas in it -- an alien huntress is a nice change from all the other kinds of paranormal heroines -- but it's SO badly written that I couldn't stand to read any more of it. God, what was her editor thinking of, to let this through? Cliche after cliche, dialogue that's supposed to be tough and kick-ass but sounds phony instead: it's like someone put Anita Blake, Eve Dallas, and Spencer in a blender and pasted the result on the page.There are a LOT of people out there now who are writing tough women, and all of them write better than this one; I suggest you read one of those, instead."
2,Little disappointed,"Showalter disappointed me with this book. I was leery of her at first but her other titles in the Atlantis series are really good but this one was slow in the beginning, and when the book got on track it slowed again. The herione in this book wasn't as memorable as the others from Pleasure Slave and The Nymph King."
4,"Aliens, Cops & Danger","First, the cover design rocks. I was one of the people who thought this was a paranormal romance, but it's more of a science fiction mystery. It's a darker story about an alien hunter, Mia, who has to work with a dangerously attractive -- and plain dangerous -- alien because her partner will die if she doesn't. It's one of those who-do-you-trust? stories and I liked it a lot once I got into it. I was reminded of the politics of non-humans vs. humans in Charlaine Harris's novels."
1,Wow!! Really Bad!!,"I'm a huge fan of paranormal romance. Unfortunately, there was very little romance in this book. The heroine was totally rude, immoral and a totally unlikeable person. I actually hoped that she and the hero didn't get together in the end, believe it or not. As a reader of romance for many years, I've never wished this before.Overall, the book was badly written. I'm not just talking about it being written in first person, just badly written in general. My first time reading this author's work. I definitely won't try her again."
3,Anita Blake meets cheesy romance novel,"The protagonist will remind you a lot of Anita Blake, only more of a spoiled brat. It makes you wonder why all the strong female leads in this type of book are written in the first person, and are tiny, dark-haired, dark-eyed women. The book started out well as a paranormal adventure, then degraded into a cheap bodice ripper. The ""secret"" that we discover about Mia was pretty obvious. There are lots of loose ends, and the romance between Mia and Kyrin was poorly developed."
5,Great boots,"These hip boots are great. They are made of High quality and unlike most pairs of boots, they size correctly. I normally wear a size 12 and these were the only boots that I've ever found that I also wear a size 12 in. Great product and they shipped extremely fast!"
4,Packaging Review,I have seen this show a few times and really enjoyed it but I never boughtSix Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Setsince it was quite expensive and I was waiting for the price to go down.This new set is cheaper ($67 - the old one is now discontinued). All 24 dvds are hosted in a book you can flip with one disk per spread (made of cardboard with glossy inner pockets - Similar to HBO Rome complete DVD set). It's a third of the size comparing to the original boxset.The 2 CD soundtrack is not included in this boxset.
2,Bad Packaging,"I bought this because I've heard such good things about the series. But I only got to see the first episode from this boxed set because after that the discs were unwatchable. I had heard the packaging was bad, but I didn't think it could possibly be this horrible. When I removed the discs from the box some of them had paint on them and others had glue on the edges. I couldn't watch it and had to send it back. Safe to say I was disappointed."
5,one of THE very best shows on television,This series might be the best show to ever air on TV. The series finale had me sobbing and brought the show to a complete close. The character development and acting is AMAZING. Can't get enough.
5,No Regrets!!,It was awesome to watch Six Feet Under from beginning to end. It was better than watching it on HBO whenever i was able to catch an episode.
5,amazing box set,"I really had no idea about this show until I caught a few episodes on cable, but it is extremely addictive. This set is a must have, commentaries are great, and they have nice featurettes on some of the discs. I started watching with my fiancee` a few weeks ago, and we find ourselves watching episode after episode... outstanding show!"
5,the best tv show ever,"A friend of mine bugged me for years asking me if I watched this show. When I finally got it from Netflix I watched the entire first season in a weekend! The characters are fantastic! Quirky, strange, dysfunctional and wierd. From the very first episode you know that you are in for a wild ride. And the very last episode? Bawled my head off --- the best ending possible to a great show..."
5,excellent viewing,"I loved the series and am looking forward to watching it ALL again, loved the astro-turf and grave stone on the top, too. Cool touch!"
4,Caron Wheeler's absence is sorely felt!,"Although vocalists Kym Mazelle, Victoria Wilson-James, Lamya, and Marcia Lewis perform well on their respective solos, the powerhouse performances of Caron Wheeler from the group's first album drops this recording down a few notches.With that in mind, the instrumental selections are clearly the better offerings here: ""Time (Untitled)"" and ""Courtney Blows"", are jazzy enough not to be pop and pop enough not to be jazz.That is Soul II Soul's contribution to the music industry: being something for everyone."
5,So much Fun!,"Love it, it was easy to figure out and it was really fun. It was the best playing it with 6 players,"
3,One Crazy Movie,"I saw this movie way back in the early 80's, and being a fan of Linnea Quigley, this is the earliest and most you will ever see of her, you can tell she is quite young because there is signs of teen acne on her face, overall the movie is quite amateur-est and poorly done, so if you are a Linnea Quigley fan check it out, if not you might want to skip this one."
1,Don't Buy This Product Ever!!!!!!!!!!,This product adds spyware to your computer. It may remove some spyware but it also adds it too!!!! I had to pay a computer repairman $130 to get all the junk off that spysweeper put on!!!!
5,Excellent book on early history of Rio de Janeiro.,"This book provides an excellent view on the life on all classes of people living in Brazil throughout the eighteenth century. Well doucumented, easy to read, and fascinating."
2,"Great reputation, horrible design","I purchased the Companion 2 as a backup to my Bose MediaMate speakers. Both cost around the same retail wise. I am highly disappointed by the sound i get out of the Companion 2 speakers. The bass is soo pumped up you cant hear the lighter tones. When Listening to one of my favorites Slayer songs the guitar riff completely disappears just like it did on the BOSE 141 speakers. I also found that turning up the volume doesn't help any. If anything it distorts the music.I would highly recommend that if you want a pair of ""GOOD"" Bose speakers look for the mediamate. they are far superior."
4,good speakers,"These are great laptop/desktop speakers to sit on your desk. I use it for listening to mp3s and watching dvds, and the sound is good and clean, and i now hate my laptop speakers (which i use when i'm not at my desk).There are two downsides, first the speakers are too large (for me anyways) to be lugging them around the house or take them anywhere, and second, there is no power button on them."
3,"Fabulous Sound, Unconscionable Price","Hey, these sound great, but they cost too much. Given that you can get Creative's little pocket speaker for a laptop at less than half the price, it's hard to justify the incremental cost OR size.That said, though, these are highly competent speakers and uphold the Bose traditions well."
2,Good sound when they do not buzz,"For the price I paid them I am very disappointed. The sound was good and pure in the Bose tradition but sometimes in the midrange the left speaker was unpleasantly vibrating with a buzzing noise. You can get better than this with half the price. Sadly. I returned them and got a pair of ""trivial"" creative and feel more satisfied. I hope my review will be of help."
2,Go for Klipsch promedia 2.0 in this price range.,"Bose makes fashion statement products. For the same price you get 3 driver klipsch speakers with dual woofers/single tweeter, vs bose lone single range driver.Klipsch has 30 watts RMS for the system, Bose won't even tell you the amplifier rating. I found many great reviews for the Klipsch 2.0 on the web, none for the Bose 2.0s."
2,Started Out Good,"When I first plugged these speakers in they were fine. I was perfectly satisfied with the sound, though there are better things out there for just a little more money. It was only after the first night that these speakers started to go down in my book. I believe it was the power cord that made the speakers crackle and moan loudly, but I couldn't stand the sound. I encountered two other sets from the returns I made until i finally decided to upgrade them using the replacement plan that I got."
1,No response,I needed to return this product. I got no response from the seller re my inqury on what I needed to do to return the product.
3,It fits. Don't know if it works. Not for toilet.,"Seemed like a good idea for my weekend home. The part fits and works for the icemaker and dishwasher. The version for the toilet does not work. Will not let enough water in to fill the tank.Now, I don't know if they actually work in an emergency until I have an emergency. It seems that you will never know if it works, only if it does not."
1,Fuel For The Big Tire Fire,"We have a big fire burning out of control about a hundred miles east of here consisting of discarded, old tires. This would be a welcome addition."
2,Traditional it ain't,"If you like good traditional Christmas music, don't buy this album. I was too distracted by Bolton's style and distortion of familiar songs to enjoy it."
2,A bit misleading about the content,"I was expecting the usual flirting content common to this genre (girl-boy interaction with possible brief toplessness followed by the bleeding nose for males). I was expecting the equivalent of an ""R"" movie in the theaters. The level of toplessness and sex acts (although not fully shown) puts this film as at least NC-17 and possibly ""X"" (I only watched to a certain point). The early part of the film warns that NOONE UNDER 18 SHOULD SEE THIS FILM...there are some people over 18 (even way over like me) that do not want to see this...I did not finish the film. The plot itself is not bad and I tried to stick with the film...it was just saltier than I wanted to see. If this is not hentai it is fairly close. Parents need to be warned...many still think anime is for kids (I have heard comments to this end)...some is and some very clearly is not. This clearly is not."
1,offensive,The album is heavy handed and ponderous. It is very self conscious and the Bob Dylan worship is far too distracting. The name dropping is nauseating. And his voice is about as appealing as a meal of lemon dripped fox tail. Pretentious sap. Bern this sucker.
3,WHITE FEMALE RAPPER,"AS A DEBUT ALBUM, THE ROTTWEILER IS PRETTY GOOD. THE CD HAS MANY LEVELS FOR DIFFERENT LISTENERS. THERES ALOT OF HIP HOP, BUT THERE ARE ALSO A COUPLE OF DANCE TRACKS. I THINK ONE OF THE BEST SONGS ON THE ALBUM IS EX-RATED. THE SONG HAS ALOT OF DOUBLE MEANINGS AND EXPOSES A PERSONAL SIDE OF RED DAWN. AS A WHITE FEMALE RAPPER THE ROAD FOR RED DAWN WILL BE HARD, BUT IF THIS FIRST ALBUM IS ANY INDICATION, SHE'LL BE FINE. THIS ALBUM IS A MUST BUY."
3,cheesy good fun,"What can I say about this album, if only that it's crazy good 80's fun! This might not have been Amos' best sample of writing, but there are some gems here. Cool on Your Island, Floating City and Etienne are fantastic. Only a couple of tracks are truly awful and the rest are charmingly 80's nostalgia. It's not really bad, because 95% of the music in the 80's was like this. :PThe version I purchased from Amazon was a genuine copy, that was not a bootleg and did not come with the extra tracks. I bought the vinyl version that was neither opened, nor a bootleg. Be careful about purchasing bootlegs!"
2,Another Mediocre attempt at best.,"Well, what can I say? To say I am disappointed by this movie is putting it mildly. Again, this is another movie of which the standards were extremely poor.The audio and visual of this movie were in any case extremely saddening. To see that movies made by Arabs, for the Arab Americans who reside in this country or any other country for that matter, are made with such total lack of resources or talent is maddening to say the least.Salam, which is the main character,(whose voice is played by an adult woman I might add) is a boy who could be drawn into a world of lies and thievery.Thankfully, Salam has religious parents who would not let this be. The moral of the story is the only redeeming quality. A person must not lie or steal. One should not hang out with friends who could be a bad influence on them.I just believe that they could have spent a little more time, effort and money to make a better educational film."
5,Great Product,This DVD goes a little beyond the basics and teaches good ideas for placement on return of serve and net play. Would recommend for the intermediate tennis player.
4,kitchen set,"All the grandchildren, aged 6 down to 18 months, love playing with this. The 3 yr old boy managed to pull it down on top of himself but no one was injured. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it took us 3 hours for two of us to assemble it."
1,Opus Dei,"I'm a Catholic, but I find Josemaria Escriva to be a thoroughly disgusting person. Whether he was canonized or not makes no difference to me - his teachings include corporal mortification and other forms of what is basically torture in order to be ""closer to God"" and I feel as though this is not what should be taught to people seeking religious fulfillment."
3,Smells great,This coffee is very good provided you make it stronger than you normally would. The coffee smells and tastes like blueberries but remember to really use alot of beans
2,Couldn't swallow the deus ex machina,"This was an enjoyable enough read, I suppose, and it certainly contains some cool ideas (e.g. the concept of a cellular automaton rich enough to support a simple biochemistry). However, the bulk of the plot hinges on a deus ex machina that I found impossible to swallow, and this tainted my enjoyment of the book henceforth. Also, the characters were totally flat, not that this is unusual in ""hard"" SF."
3,5 star ideas from a 1 star writer,"This book presented great ideas. Unfortunately, it presented them via a horrible book. Egan is a wonderful thinker but an awful writer. The characters/plot/story left much to be desired. I know I know the characters/plot/story are just ""vehicles"" for his ideas critics say, well, that sounds like a cop out on not being able to write an interesting AND enjoyable read. Very interesting. Not enjoyable. Can't say I'd even recommend the book due to the pain of having to slosh through his ""writing"" to get to the cool ideas/theory. Maybe if he could team up with another (better!) writer..."
3,I AM STILL MIDWAY...,"I haven't really finished the book & I find it very tempting to simply give up, close the pages & stuff the book in my shelf. Although I enjoy reading 'sci-fi"" books, I find this too technical & unfortunately, I really do not appreciate it as much. However, after seeing the other readers' comments, I feel inspired to continue reading the book till the end no matter how much effort it might take me to do so. Hopefully, I will have a better opinion to share with afterwards."
2,"Too much technical detail, too little plot","There are a lot of interesting ideas in this book, but unfortunately none are fully developed. There is very little plot and the characters, who were difficult to tell apart, are simply devices to carry out the techical details. The author missed a great chance here to explore the philosophical implications of the technology. Without knowing anything about the author, I'd guess he writes technical manuals and this is his first try at a novel."
5,Vague Nostalgia,"I read this when it was released in 1995 and still have my copy. It unerringly makes my list of top 10 speculative fiction works.At this far of a remove, I don't remember the details beyond modeling a slightly simpler universe inside of a computer, but It opened up a new world of science fiction for me. This was one of the first science fiction books that I read the year it was published, and thus the first without the ""past looking forward through a present not my own"" feeling that Asimov and Heinlein and many others gave me."
3,"Lee Van Cleef always good, particularly in Westerns, but this spaghetti W. DVD is flawed by bad reproduction!","Beware the 'Passion Productions' copiesof this original 1971 Italian/Germanproduction! Fine film overall, but no-where near as good as w/ Eastwood inFor a Few Dollars More. Might be worthgetting for Lee Van Cleef fans. Also,check out Armed Response, one of hislast, The Octogon, w/ Chuck Norrisand Escape From New York, w/ KurtRussell!"
3,Van Cleef the guardian angel eyes!,"The Grand Duel is a fairly well made spaghetti western with the usual revenge theme of a man falsely accused of murder.There are some good stunts in the film, along with a lot of gratuitous violence and some brief nudity.Overall a pretty fair example of the genre."
5,The children love it,First grade on like this game. It helps with adding 2-digit numbers in the Queen count. I allow the students to add up all the number cards (mostly 1-digit) in their hand (and have others check to see if they are right) so they can discard them and get a new set of cards that hopefully includes a King card.And then there is the fun of stealing a Queen or putting one to sleep.There's enough variety to keep the game interesting.
4,"A good, quick card game","My daughter got this for her birthday last year, and it has become one of her favorites. We like to play this as a family, and it can be helpful in teaching kids to count by 5's. There is also some strategy involved in stealing queens, which queens to steal, and why. An enjoyable game overall."
2,"Emphasize the world ""sleep""","This was a big bust as a present for my grandchildren ages 6, 5, and 2. It ended up on the floor and was never played.So the Queen sleeps in peace."
5,A Great New Game for Us!!,"My daughter is six and at that age it is VERY challenging to find a game we both enjoy. This one is engaging enough for me and a lot of fun for her. There is a little math in it, but not so much that she doesn't like the game, and it can be played with no math at all for younger players. My husband will even sit down and play this one! The characters are clever and the rules are many, but fun and easy to remember. This is definitely one of the best games we've gotten!"
5,My 6 yr old LOVES IT!,We got this for our 6 year old daughter for Christmas and we've played at least a couple games every day since. She LOVES IT! And I wouldn't have ever heard of it except on Amazon. Never seen it in any stores. It's a great family game and pretty easy to learn. I wish there were more card games like this out there!
4,Kingston SDRAM,"This is an excellent choice to upgrade the limited capacity of Dell PC'swhich generally are 1Mb. After checking with Kingston on using higher fsbmodules, I found the memory bus speed of my Dell is limited to 133Mhz andis therefore not upgradeable.There is no reason not to use SDRAM at the full rated fsb speed of mother-boards in Dell computers, or any other manufacturer. Dell does not offerit and charges too much money for the same private label products like theKingston SDRAM reviewed here. Why buy from Dell when you can get the samething or better for less? Unfortunately Dell limits the memory bus speedof their builds less than full rated fsb. With a schematic there could bea resistor value change available to enable full fsb speed on the memorybus, and then an upgrade path to faster modules is available when done."
4,No Chemical Smell,Happen to like this fragrance. Lasts a day or 2 without any chemical smell or heavy scent. Use primarily for a quick shot when picking up someone. Quick and easy.
4,COULD BE BETTER,"Boston has that certain ""feel"" to their songs, and all the songs on this Greatest Hits cd, feel like they could have been recorded, just for this cd. That is good, but also bad. About the only changing the band has done on their 4 cds since 1977, is change lead singers. Their is 4 new tracks, one of which (Higher Power) is on the cd twice (why?, the song is good, but not that good), no big change in either version. the other two is Tell Me (yuck), and an insturmental of the Star Spangled Banner, which Jimmy did better. But still not a bad cd to start your Boston collection."
5,Boston - 'nuff said,One of the best all time American bands to ever grace the stage and radio. Boston personifies what 1970's classic rock is.
4,Nice collection of sets from Boston,"Like it, as I liked Boston. These is a nice collection of many of Boston's best tunes and it's sells for a very reasonable price."
5,For Real Rock Lovers Only,"As someone who grew up in the 70's, appreciating great bands such as Boston, I must say that this is one of the best compilations available for those who really need a good dose of classic rock. For those music misfits who rated this album poorly, they need to get a life and adjust their ""virgin ears"" because they compare this to the crap that plays on the radio today and it's no comparison whatsoever!"
4,A few changes would have made this perfect...,"BOSTON is a great band, allbeit hardly a prolific one. KISS released more albums in its first few years than Boston has in two-plus decades. Nevertheless, this album sums up their career quite nicely. There are a few missing tracks that would have made this a better collection. My suggestion would be to dump the ""Star Spangled Banner"" and the ""Higher Power (Kalodner Edit)"" -is anybody else sick of these stupid remixes/edits? What a waste of space- and add in their place:Hitch A RideWe're ReadyWalk OnThese small changes would have made this album the perfect collection of Boston material. The new tracks are pretty good-I was pleasantly surprised. Even without the above three tracks this is still a good intro to the band for those who have none of their stuff. You get the all the most important tunes.Recommended."
1,You already have the first and 3rd Stage...,"So don't waste your money on this pointless release. ""Boston"" and ""3rd Stage"" are the best to own and this offers nothing new that you can't have off of those two. This is nothing more than a gimmick of ""let's milk Boston for all they are worth"". Who is Tom Sholtz to trick us into believing a new singer is Brad Delp? Stick with ""Boston"" and ""3rd Stage"" and you'll have the only Boston you'll ever need."
1,Queen if Outer Space,"This video was bought by me for my Eric Fleming collection. He was Mr. Favor on RAWHIDE in case no one recognizes him as Zza Zza's leading man. In other words, I never would have bought it except for Eric."
4,"Campy, but very sexy","Yeah, it's campy, but I loved it! As a child of the fifties, I find the women in this movie very hot. Of course, there was no sex in this film, but the kissing scenes were outstanding. I wish I could have been in the shoes of the Lieutenant, or the commander, who gets but one kiss with Zsa Zsa.They don't make them like that any more, but I wish they did.Harmless fun. Probably shot on a dime, too."
2,Jennifer Is Nice To Watch But ...,"I just finished watching this and whooeee, I'm gonna have to fumigate my house after this one. A complete ... marries a wonderful princess (odd combination you might think) and she decided, after he kicks the ...out of her, to kick the ... out of him. Unnaturally meaningless and shallow. But then there's Jennifer Lopez, which brings the rating I give up to two stars."
4,"Not ""Enough"" Development","Although I enjoyed the movie, I felt that the development of the characters, ie the huband and his police friend was completely left out. For the sake of time, the movie makers could have reduce the time spent on the chase scenes and the dialog between mom and the (real cute) little girl and given it to the development of those men."
1,Get out!,"This was one of the worst, clichefests I've seen in years. Everything that happened was predictable and not so much foreshadowed as hammered into the viewers heads. It came across as more of a dramatization of a WEAVE pamplet than a movie that came from an actual script or was given an thought or care. At one point the words ""GET OUT"" flashed up on the screen and my friend and I took that as a sign from God and did just that."
1,Enough said...,"Turkey with Jennifer Lopez as a victim of marital abuse. After finally having the courage to leave her husband nabbing her child in tow, Lopez moves to a new location and goes on a bodybuilding course to return back home to kick her ugly husband's (Billy Campbell) lily [hiney]. Ridiculous, predictable film with a plot so wafer thin it's laughable.Enough proves to be another rehash of one of those shameful TVM movies about a battered wife who seeks revenge on her violent husband. Had it not had so many plotholes and miscast characters, Enough may have survived the critics test but as Lopez films go- this one really takes the biscuit."
1,Not worth it...,"This movie was terrible. Not even worth one star, if you ask me. I only went to see it because I'm utterly obsessed with Noah Wyle (who's only in a few scenes, SO DISSAPOINTING!).Here's the deal though....this movie has an ok premise. There are points in the movie where I was like, ""gee, this could be a good movie."" The thing is, they take every last LITTLE plot point and they serve it to you like a smack over the head with a 2 x 4. Nothing at ALL is left to suspense or to the imagination.I read in the Chicago Sun Times that this movie completely parallel's Julia Robert's 'Sleeping with the Enemy' and that all the details are like completely the same. Maybe SWTE is a better movie...For what it's worth though, save your money and DON'T see this movie unless you like really tacky, cliche, all-too-long movies."
2,The only thing good about this movie...,"is that Jennifer Lopez is in it. She is beautiful and does her job well. The story is an improbable one at best with a supporting cast that doesn't quite get the job done. This could have been a superb movie. As it is, this is a remake or wannabe of ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" with Julia Roberts which was a first-rate movie in every way.This one just doesn't manage to elcit much emotion except for boredom."
5,Great movie!,"I dont know how she manages to play her roles this way, but she's really beliveable, no matter what character she plays! This movie is amazing, every single woman that ever was in a relationship which turned to be abusive, knows how hard is sometimes to say stop and go your own way! This movie shows this situation in very special way, and Jen's playing is great, yes I am a fan of her, and I know every single movie she did, but I can say which were really good, and which dont worth it, well this movie worths it! i wont say what is it about, you all know it. But what I want to say is that even if you're not a JLO fan, or of any other actor involved, you still would love the movie. Worths all the money!"
1,Enough is enough,"Here's a classic Hollywood case where Ms Nobody - Lopez - is quickly transformed from a diner waitress into an abused wife of a wealthy husband who in spite of JLo's refusal, insists on imposing his extramarital relationships into their marriage. Lopez dares to abandon him together with their 5 year old daughter, but since the legal system is inadequate in offering her protection and her ruthless husband finds countless ways to harass her, she decides to become a proud combination of James Bond and Bruce Lee and extinct her abusive husband.Pros: J.Lo in tightsCons: Everything else"
3,Too Far Fetched!,"Lopez as a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband with her daughter and goes into hiding. With huge financial resources and a bunch of mafia like goons behind him it is only a matter of time before the husband tracks Lopez down.As a last resort, Lopez goes to train with a martial artist who trains her to be able to fight back against whatever attack her husband may throw at her. When her training is complete Lopez goes with the intention of actually beating him to death but later learns that her humanity will not let her do it.I felt a lot of the movie is a little far-fetched to rate it higher, otherwise I would have given it four stars. Lopez does toughen up in the movie (a la Linda Hamilton in Terminator II) and gives a totally different persona than she normally shows."
5,BEST JLO MOVIE EVERRR!,Jlo is the best in this moviethis is oscar worthythe bad guy is cute and does good tooThe ending is pure ectasy!Everyone needs to rent and Own this movieGo to youtube and see the music videos they have for thisBetter than Chocolate!Can i rate this 1 million stars?
3,Just magical.,"We follow the story of Cassy, Gus and Verne, three students in a magical realm hidden from the eyes of Morties(non-magical beings), as they battle magik school and the evil wizard Zarlak.This is a 'What you see, is what you get' DVD! It contains 3 episodes from the UBOS series and nothing else, no special features other than the standard episode selection. Picture and sound quality is good but not great.An overall lame release, basically a DVD version of the original VHS release."
2,This one is flawed . . .,"This is a good tape to own if you are into contemporary music, and want some variety in your collection. Although the sound quality is poor, the music is really fun and it is well choreographed. Once you get the hang of the moves (trust me, if I can do it, ANYONE can) it is an easy and fun routine that I look forward to doing. However, it isn't very challenging and wouldn't be suitable for all fitness levels. And Amy Acuff, who is supposed to be the main attraction, is not that great. She is so uncoordinated and confused me when she was on the screen. Stick to the high-jump Amy! She is the reason I gave this tape a 2."
3,a good intention,Very valuable information but not usersfriendly.The essence of the message is very simple but the author does not seem to master the art of simplicity to get it across.As a self help you need a lot of persistance to go through the whole book.Also the exercices don t present anything new.Nevertheless I found it a good idea to combine Western psychology with Eastern wisdom in one book.
4,Theoratical and elegant,"This is a book essentially about turning adversity into advantage and it's written with good linguistic skills and beautuful ideas. However, the practical aim of the book is to help readers ride out their storms and gain as much as possible in the process but the content is delivered in a rather literary and technical manner. As a self-help book, simplicity is the key because most readers who turn to books of this genre hanker after precise and concise words and messages. Thus, the main and perhaps only demerit of this book is the message of the book and the way it is delivered are not perfectly attuned to one another. That said, as a self-help book, it is not of first choice. But as a book in general, it's a good-quality and highly readable book."
2,"Pretty, but will they ever chime?","I like the way these chimes look, including the rock base, but I have yet to hear them ring. We've had some big storms the past few weeks, and neither wind nor rain (nor dark of night?) has made them chime. On their looks, they get 4 stars, but on their sound they get a 1."
2,Should have listened to the Amazon Reviews.,I ignored the reviews of those submitted by others and learned I shouldn't have. I liked the design as we were go to use it at family events as a remembrance of those no longer with us. The idea being as you passed by you could ring the chimes as remembrance without words. The chimes were difficult to ring even with enough effort that you felt you needed to hold the base which resulted in a couple of clunking sounds instead of a chime. It was the first item we ever returned to Amazon.
2,Garden bells,"Great concept, however, the wires on the chimes are so stiff that I haven't heard them ring even in high wind situation. Thought maybe they were rain chimes (needed water in the cups to move) - but even the extra weight of the water won't make them chime. However, they are very pretty and make a nice outdoor piece."
2,not a good choice,"don't buy it. there is no real instruction. the viewer is expected to follow the instructor visually. that is not enough with yoga, especially for beginners. the setting is nice, the production is good, but the guidance and instruction is not there. breathing is one of the foundations of yoga, but there is no mention of breathing until the tape is almost over; even then, it is lacking. i didn't even show it to my wife, and getting her practicing was half the purpose of buying the tape. this is coming from someone who has taken yoga for several years: it's not a good choice."
2,Too Easy,"One would really have to be out of shape to find this tape worthwhile. I did like the fact that it's only 20 minutes--makes it easy to fit into a busy schedule. But, it's just too easy. I also did not like the fact that most of the positions were done on a chair. That seems inconvenient."
1,Be careful when you try this one!,"I bought this tape to strengthen and stretch out my back after recovering from a pulled lower back muscle.After doing the tape, I had a sore neck for nearly a week from doing the twisting poses.I wish I had my money back."
4,Insightful.,"Tom Friedman's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls; states v. markets v. individuals; and the comprehensive failure of the Arab street, leadership and Muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out. From reading this compilation of NYT columns, I understand where Friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book, 'The World is Flat.' Although I sometimes disagree with his opinions, his ability to see the big picture is spot on."
5,Superb and Insightful!,"I am a devoted fan of Tom Friedman's, and his latest work does not disappoint. While I did not agree with all of Friedman's viewpoints (I found him overly supportive of the Bush administration's realist politics at times) I appreciated his frankness in discussing how September 11 affected him personally. Moreover, his clear, concise reflections on Middle Eastern politics changed my perspective on certain issues, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Finally, I sincerely enjoyed Friedman's fascinating accounts of his meetings with some of the movers and shakers in the Middle East. ""Longitudes and Attitudes"" is a ""must read"" for anyone grappling to understand the impact of September 11 or anyone who is interested in the Middle East in general."
2,could have been better.,The book starts with the usual liberal diatribe that the 2000 elections were stolen. What this has to do with the geopolitical situation anywhere in the world but the USA is a mystery that goes unanswered. The second part of the book is more interesting as it details humorous incidents that happen during the author's travels but if I wanted a travel book I would have bought a travel book. Sorry but this one didn't do it for me. Your mileage may vary.
3,I've seen worse,"I've read the other reviews and I agree with both the good and the bad. This is not a great film. I doubt that it will ever be even a ""cult classic"". However, I have seen a lot worse. The characters are decently drawn, in that you probably dislike all of them. The story is interesting if a bit unexplained. The acting is at the worst decent and at the best competent. Lindsay Goranson does a good job with the stepmother and Josslyn DeCrosta is competent as the main daughter. On the bad side, some of the effects are less than wonderful, there are sudden lapses in acting by several characters, the story line is not developed well and there is no explanation for whatever happened in the Irish village to cause this curse. Still, all the main female characters are attractive and at least competent, the faux Irish scenery is nice and there is enough action and gore to keep most people interested."
2,I can't believe this is a Katie Fforde book,I have loved everything Katie Fforde has written but I really had to make an effort to finish this one. Her character developement in this book was soo basic you could see what was going to happen from page 1. The Grace character is so down-trodden and put-upon that it is hard to feel sorry for her. I am really looking forward to Flora's Lot to get me back in her fan club
1,"The same person who wrote ""Wild Designs"" wrote this? I don't believe it!","This storyline sounded promising. But I really had to struggle with this one. Midway through I put it down and re-read ""Wild Designs."" I find it hard to believe these two books were written by the same person.I simply don't believe it. Unless ""Restoring Grace"" was written in a weekend. Sloppy. Too much mindless dialogue. Several characters with absolutely no appeal.More than half the dialogue in the book was unnecessary. It did not move the story along. I got the feeling the book was written and then someone - perhaps not even Katie Fforde - padded it with dialogue.Don't bother. Unless you are easily amused."
4,Good biographical detail,"Asa Hoffmann is a NY master with the reputation for skinning $$ from unsuspecting opponents. He was also poorly portrayed in the movie 'Seraching for Bobby Fischer'. Once you read this book however you may have a different opinion of him. No doubt somewhat eccentric his games here display the fighting spirit we all associate with the typical underdog. A slim volume but with fine games, photographs [which I love to see in all chess books] and some insights into the psyche of a master player. Recommended."
1,A very neurologically biased book! Not recommended.,"This book is basically a book written to bring more business to neurologists. Written by two neurologists who state ADD is best treated by neurologists and with medications. Their bias gets in the way of this book being useful. In the real world, try to find a neurologist who will take on ADD patients! Psychologists and psychiatrists are much better trained and equiped, AND available to treat this disorder. I would never recommend this book to my patients!"
1,The worst textbook I have ever seen,"I just finished Chapter 3 of this book, but I have had enough of it. Conceptions about Fourier Transform are not clear at all. And the most unbearable thing is that, there are many printing errors which may lead to misunderstanding."
4,Please bring more of that,"It's funny: I bought this book in the early nineties, forgot about it and just now read it in one session. So I tried amazon, hoping to find out more about the author and her books - and zilch. I couldn't agree more with the other reviewers represented on this site: If there is more to be had by Ms. Stevens, please put it onto the shelves!"
5,You can't get this anywhere else!,"Someone said below ""you can buy kings quest 15th anniverary with games 1 through 6 much cheaper and then purchase kings quest 7 separately much cheaper""This may be true BUT, this collection has more than 7 games. There are also 3 full additional non-king's quest game and a handful of bonus games. Buying 1-6 and then buying 7 seperately will make you miss out on the other games!This collection is fun for all ages - either for nostalgic reasons, or just b/c you like adventure! Highly recommended!"
4,The Colonel's Bequest,"I bought this collection for one reason only and that was it contained the fabulous murder mystery Colonel's Bequest - a true lost treasure.Laura Bow accompanies her friend Lillian to her grandfather's estate in a Southern bayou for a weekend where all her relatives discuss her grandfather's will. Of course the first night is riddled with murder and your job is to find out who is killing the guests.The game has no ""point"" system in it which makes it hard to play and to complete the notebook at the end. But this will keep you playing. You won't believe one bayou has so many secrets. Play this game at night for maximum effect like I did. I also believe the early VGA graphics add to the errie atmosphere. A must play for a cold lonely night!"
2,"OK CD player, very poor AM/RM receiver","CD player works fine. But the AM/FM receiver is very poor.The receiver is very subject to interference. LOC doesn'thelp, and infact often makes holding a station worse."
1,BOOORING,"I think I did not read the same book as the others here read. I was bored to death with this book. I've read other books from this author and because of the rates I tried this one. Not a good choice, not a good choice at all."
1,Doesn't Work,"I've been using Nuface for almost a month--everyday, 20 minutes a day. Absolutely no results. I'm a 42 year old woman with some sagging, etc. and I was hopeful about this product. Not only does it not work, but it also seems to really dry out my skin and leave it parched and almost more wrinkled-looking. Does this really work for other people? I find it hard to believe unfortunately."
1,Save your $,Hurts and have not seen a difference in my face. Feels like you re getting a little shock each time you use it.
1,Eye muscle stimulation and perception of flasing lights- be careful!,"I read the all of the reviews, read through the entire instructional booklet that accompanied the device and I the instructional DVD three times to make sure that I knew how to use the product correctly. I take very good care of my skin and really wanted to try this product to maintain and firm my skin.While using it, I stayed away from the eye orbital area as stated in the instructional booklet, however, I experienced the perception of flashing lights during my treatment. I looked back over the instructional booklet and did see that on page 9 , under the precautions heading, this may happen due to the stimulation of your optic nerve. I am very unhappy about this experience and I am returning the device. It is just not worth it to take a chance to me."
3,"Works great, but breaks after a year","I was one of the first people to purchase the NuFace device when it came out. I loved the results, but unfortunately after a year, the device broke. One of the silver ball connectors came loose and fell out. NuFace (Carole Cole Company) would not repair the device since it was past the 1 year warranty, so I purchased a 2nd device hoping to it was just an anomaly. Amazingly, exactly the same thing happened again. Just past the 1 year warranty, one of the silver ball connectors came loose and fell out. I contacted the company to see if they would repair it, but again they declined to do anything even though I told them I had purchased two devices and had the same problem.I am an aesthetician and a fan of microcurrent treatments, but I think at this point I'm going to look for a more professional device that I can invest in that won't break down after a year."
4,Development,"This game introduced me at a young age to communial development planning, and money management. This game is, I guess you could say, one to grow with, it takes time and it helps one to learn along the way. I'd also like to add that it helps, especially a younger mind, to experience freedom with their money allowing them to spend it as they choose. If he/she spends it unwisely (go bankrupt) that person will know to become better managers of their money the next time."
3,A Good But Undetailed Game,"This game is a great game for anyone who enjoys simulation games. The point of the game is to build a money-making metropolis. You start with a gigantic plot of land, your goal is to build and make your sims (simulated residents of your city) happy. You can do this by not raising taxes to high and supplying their demands. The game simulates time very fast but you can pause and modulate the speed. Overall, this game was great but the graphics are bad and gameplay is nothing compared to Sim City 3000."
2,Very tedious read,"The problem with this book is that are so many characters that they are hard to keep track of. When the book changes scenes you have dig the names back up to remember who has done what. On top of this a new character is introduced about every ten pages once the main characters have taken shape.It is very hard to understand the humor in the book. The only way to tell that a character has made a ""joke"" is that the characters laugh. I scratched my head many times trying to find the humor.One thing that is good in the book is the description of tactics and battle formation. Intricate battle scenes are written in a very visual way."
5,"Good Job Mister Fleming, Ian Fleming","This was one of my favorite books when I was a little kid. I am so glad that it is still in print.I never knew that the author, Ian Fleming, was the same author of the James Bond novels. That is so cool."
2,I tried to like it more than this,"It was disappointing and surprising when I finished this book and didn't like it. I genuinely tried to set aside my knowledge and love of the movie, which was successful, but even that didn't help. It seems silly to say a book about a flying car was over the top, but it's the truth. The situations were too silly to be seen as realistic, and yet too grounded in reality to overlook their silliness.That being said, it is easy to see how some children (especially boys) would find this book engrossing. The adventure and thrilling cliff-hanger chapter endings do make for a fast pace. However, those who have seen the movies may not want to cope with the differences."
2,bored to tears...,"1st things 1st...I love Woody's films and consider myself a true fan but after several re writes, scraping almost the entire film, re casting almost every role I found this film completly boring and just too claustrophobic..."
4,Love Elaine Stritch!,"This small ensemble film centers on Lane (played by Mia Farrow) who has returned to her childhood Vermont home to try and figure out what she wants out of her life. She soon falls in love with writer, Peter (Sam Waterston) who doesn't always seem to return Lane's affections; but becomes smitten with Lane's friend, Stephanie (Dianne Wiest), who is visiting for a week or two. It would be better if Lane had interest in next-door neighbor Howard (Denholm Elliott), who obviously pines for her. But then enters Elaine Stritch as Lane's mother Diane, a famous movie actress who's star has faded, and is intent on getting Peter to write her biography. Stritch is in rare form as Lane's mother, giving the movie a large dose of hilarity that it needs. She gets upstaged, however, when Lane trumps her on the elements of a story from their past.This isn't one of Woody Allen's best films, but it is definitely entertaining and well-made."
2,~Scent... :(,"This Fred Hayman perfume smells so bad :( It seriously smells like medicine (cough syrup or something)I would not recommend it to anybody. Save your money and buy the other 273, it smells way better!!"
4,Noaa radio is great,"This is a very good product for the price. We are very happy with it, but wish that the clock light could be adjusted dimmer or brighter."
3,Overall a good unit,"The Midland weather/clock radio is a good little unit. It could stand a better speaker and better antenna. Another thought would be a brightness switch. In the off mode the light is too dim for most viewing,even in a dark room. It's still worth the price here at Amazon."
2,Not what I expected.,Big disapointment to me. Diffacult to set the alarm and to reset. I struggle with this this daily but I will keep trying.
3,"Arrived promptly, speaker wire fine, spool broken","All fine, except it was packaged in a bag, and the plastic spool was broken in transit.Already putting the wire to good use. Would suggest better packaging for shipping by the vendor."
3,Too small,Really adorable dress but it's too small for my 6 pound dog (tag says an x-small should fit 3-7 lbs). Returning for a larger size. It's t-shirt material and the skirt is just girly enough. The rhinestones are good quality and large.
2,A poor choice,Sounds good- except the phone has a permant cord that allows you to move about 2 feet from the wall. It probably would never work on a desk/counter. This is not worth the trouble that it takes to unpack it and not to mention to add the batteries(not included).
1,Very dated and offers nothing new,The field of GIS has changed so rapidly that nearly everything in this book is out-of-date.There is nothing it offers that could be valuble today.
4,"Nice bed, but you can get it cheaper elsewhere","This is a very nice bed. Fits American girl or any 18'' doll. However it is expensive at Amazon. Try Walmart, there it is much cheaper."
2,cheap,"The bedding on this bed is so cheaply made it was not worth the money spent. The canopy slips all over, will not stay ""over"" bed. Not even a little foamy mattress, just a cheap piece of cloth. Very dissappointed :("
4,Excellent demonstrations,The illustration is Excellent but this Book could have been better. I do love some of training and I do use most of the Jumping routines. You will be disappointed with the training that involves partners.Overall this is a good book for your collection and Plyometric training.
5,whole series,Getting the whole series up to date is wonderful. This is such a fabulous show. It arrived on schedule and new.
5,The Closer,"This series centers on a soft spoken feminine detective boss with a Southern accent, who, once she gets her teeth into solving a crime and getting the culprit doesn't let go. Her methods leave you gasping with your jaw hanging open most of the time.Her colleagues just sit back and watch in awe (and entertainment). Most of the time, one just doesn't see what is coming. This series is extremely witty, dramatic, well acted, and just plain entertaining. Kyra Sedgewick is amazing in this role. Go on! Get hooked!"
5,A review & collection of the young talent of the league!,"Super value package! A 2-DVD set with full of exciting content! The highlights of the young stars on and off the court are more than you expect! If you've missed their highlights from these years, you should get one to keep them! Or you will sorry you haven't watch those plays! But as always, the shows had never enough! Never too long!! The Disc 2 featured the complete All-Star Game 2004 and Rookie Challenge, it is a great idea of NBA that finally they are selling the 'games'. Of course the quality must be better than us recording from TV. These money had to spend... But, why you've cut the part of introducing the all-stars?? Not complete!!"
5,Simple and Functional,"This is a simple and useful nail clipper set. With the clean stainless steel construction, these clippers are expected to last forever. The only reason that one would have to replace them is if they are lost."
2,Weak,This is the weakest of Pratchetts books.It is not a Discworld and is more sci-fi than fantasty in genre.For true fans only.Not a good introduction to the Pratchett-verse.
4,Help,Does anybody know the name of the song when Jim Carrey walks into the restaurant all dressed up? I have been trying to find that song for months!
1,Wrong rulings completely destroy validity,"The ruling in this book on quickplay magic cards is incorrect. They can be played at ANY time during your turn, not just in main and in battle, for your information. This is not acceptable in an ""official"" guide. These rulings come from konami of japan via pojo.com. These rulings hsould be reliable."
3,Ancient & Medieval Modelling (Osprey Masterclass),"This book is not about so-called ""how to paint for biginers"". It only has a small chapter with basical miniature modelling techniques. But very nice work in it, not only converting and scratch building, but olso author showing about the ancient and medieval back ground world. It's intresting to read. Good guide book for miniture modellers who wants to jump-up to next step."
2,Looked very used and worn,This book was very worn and used looking...and a duplication of the paperback version below....very disappointed....how much more can i say...
5,LOVE The books..HATE THE PRICE,I have read and reread these books since they first came out in the 1980's. they are fantastic stories and would love to reread again on Kindle but NOT at these prices. I refuse to pay full price for a digital copy. Please Amazon..get with these publishers and tell them how much that are losing in revenue.
2,Won't bother with the rest of the series,"Perhaps it's my bad for not reading all the reviews, but I thought each book in the Spellsinger Adventure would tell a pretty complete tale--one with a beginning, a middle, and a climactic end (like each Harry Potter book). However, this first book is just a beginning. I was dismayed to learn how abruptly the book ended, and although the characters are pleasant enough, there just wasn't enough going on to make me want to continue to the next book, given that there are 8 total! I'm sad I wasted my money on an introduction, especially since the story in Book One doesn't contain much that isn't already in the Product Description."
4,Funny and full of Adventure,"I have to disagree with a previous reviewer in one regard. I do think that the animals in the book are cute and funny. Granted, the animals act in realistic, sometimes noble, but more often crass ways. Part of the fun in this book is the sheer absurdness of the animals and the world at all.I think you have to treat the book slightly humorously. I think humor was a great par of Mr. Foster's intent. The original cover has a bespectacled turtle on a boat with two humans and an otter. The turtle has drawers in his shell which open. I laughed quite hard the first time I looked at the cover. The hero gets to the fantasy world after smoking marijuana. The hero wins his battles and creates magic by playing and singing rock and roll.....BADLY.A very fun book but also treat it as fun and not high fantasy."
4,a collection of short stories/varied authors,"This collection of short stories edited by Lin Carter is a nice mix of science fiction and adventure tales. Storm in a bottle for the barbarian lovers,Bag full of Dreams for the Magician in us all, The Tupilak by Paul Anderson is somewhere in the arctic circle Long long ago..Swords against Murluk for the lovers of the battle between light and darkness; The lands Beyond The world for more barbarians and some ghost riders included to thunder across the pages with a beautiful princess to be rescued. This collection of stories is a fun and entertaining glimps into the sword and sorcery genre. Imaginative and fun."
4,Focuses on a key problem,"This book faces the issue of what drives the behaviour (so much of which is ultimately dysfunctional) of youngb black males. Starting with the need to fit in, to cope and to find a way to command a place in their environment. A good basis for understanding what needs to be done to lead them to being more fulfilled members of the wider society."
5,Great item,"If you're a clock watcher anyway, this clock is for you! It is unique, eye-catching and well designed. The instructions are easy, and you will be able to tell time with this clock in...well, no time!"
3,It's ok,"I use these for my turtle tank. They are decent, but the connections to the air tubes is very hard to get on. It might be easier to use the soft airtubes if you buy these.. Maybe one of those extension things might help as well."
1,Feh,"Ok. First I want to say this was the worst game I have ever played. I think it is awful! AWFUL! The graphics stink, the music is bad, it is practically impossible to win a battle without taking weeks(!) to build your army,you have to wait for the computer to take its turn, you can never seem to click on the unit you want, the map is dumb and keeps repeating itself, the menus are hard to understand, the icons for the units are worse than the graphics.In short, I consider the... I paid for this an overpayment.(I got it on sale at Office Depot)Spend your money on Starcraft instead.Feh!"
1,buyer beware,"this machine is a nightmare. i recieved mine about a year ago and it has been in the shop several times each to the tune of $100 or more. everything has gone out on it, the warranty is a joke. i still have not completed an entire design without it churping at me that the design transmission has been interrupted and cannot resume. go with the brother brand. afforable and reliable."
1,If I could rate it zero stars I would have.,"I had the CE100 for all of 3 days and it was just awful, I ended up exchanging it for the CE200 (so glad I did) The CE100, has some problems, first off, it doesn't sew, and considering this IS a sewing machine I find this to be a big problem!! The bobbin thread will not lock your stitches, and on top of that the top thread breaks like every 4 stitches. And for those of you wondering I have sewn for over 15 years and believe me I called customer service, and they told me that the CE100 series has a problem with the bobbin casing cracking. Well call me crazy but why are they still selling the dumb thing then?? Seriously, I spent 3 very long days doing nothing but being upset, angry, and aggervated, not to mention saying ugly words and making up new ones when those didn't work:-) Save yourself from what I went through, just spend the extra money and get the CE200, once you get it and figure it out , it can be addictive! Good luck and happy sewing!!"
1,I can't believe I sat through this.,"The Cable Guy starring Jim Carrey could possibly be his worst film of all-time. He is absolutely horrible in this and so is Matthew Broderick. Their strange chemistry is completely off and even the funny Jeanne Garfalo looks like she hated filming this dark comedy. The only funny scene is when Carrey sings the Jefferson Airplane song, Somebody to Love. I hate to say it but this one is a stinker!"
5,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although I am a kid!,"Hilarious! I love this movie! It is one of Jim Carreys greatest performances. It is so funny every time I see it I crack up. It is one of my favorite comedys one of the funniest movies Ive ever seen. Mathew Broderick did great in it also, and so did Leslie Mann(super hot!) This movie is a very dark comedy I heard it did not do so well. I dont know why Ben Stiller did an excellent job directing it."
3,relevant social commentary interspersed with dark humour,"Jim Carrey's 5th mainstream feature didn't perform up to the standard of his previous ventures at the U.S box office and was subsequently ignored by close-minded fans. However, 'The Cable Guy' is an unconventional film that combines a relevant sub-text that refers to the level of media influence over rejected, disaffected individuals lifestyles and the deconstruction of the family unit that ultimately paved the outlet for this grim social reality. The film's paradoxical manner dosen't always succeed but is still worthy of praise despite it's obvious shortcomings in the analysis of an intergral aspect of mainstream/popular culture. Worth checking out nevertheless."
1,Dissapointed,My daughter got this as a gift and was very excited. We did everything according to the instructions but the sequins just didn't attach. We've tried various fabrics but ended up with the same result. Poor product.
2,Artery clogger,"This book was given to me by a friend that received two. While the recipes are interesting combinations and I am sure are tasty they are also nutritionally awful! I was amazed at the amounts of sodium, cholesterol ,fat and calories in a serving . What is lost in frying in butter/oil is gained by what is added to the marinades, sauces and the addition of cheese and other meats ie grilled chicken with fontina and prosciutto, per serving 576 calories, 35 grams fat,158mg cholesterol, 656 mg sodium, 0 fiber. That is over 1/2 of what is recommended for the daily intake of fat and cholesterol and a 1/4 of the sodium intake, 59 grams protien which is over the amount needed in a day. The vegetable recipes are better but still not what I consider healthy. I would not recommend this cook book if you trying to limit your daily intake of calories,fat,cholesterol, sodium etc."
4,Life With Zoe is good too,I just wrote because I didn't see any appriciation of Life Without Zoe mentioned...I loved the piece - it was innocent and precocious in an endearing way - the girl plays at being an adult like many adolescent girls...Zoe is still learning how to be an adult and she's excessive in some ways...I think Coppola lovingly depicts her character...it had a lot of charm...I wonder if other reviews expected a different tone from Coppola...I also really liked Life Lessons ...Oedipus Wrecks was entertaining but wasn't one of Woody Allen's stronger pieces...and im a big Woody Allen enthusiast.Incidently Woody Allen uses adolescent girl charaters similar to Zoe often: including in the movies Everyone Says I Love You and Crimes and Misdomeanors
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This rewrite has turned a culinary masterpiece into Just Another Cookbook. Most of the new material is duplicated elsewhere, and the unique qualities of the old version have been jettisoned.Only those who are unfamiliar with the original could consider this dumbed-down shadow of Mrs. Rombauer's magnum opus worthwhile. If you don't like some of the the heavier meat dishes in the original, there are plenty of vegetable, legume, and luncheon dish recipes, and the informational sections show you how to adapt recipes to your own taste.I think I'm qualified to make the call on this one, since my grandmother cooked with the first edition of the ""Joy"", my father used (and is still using) the 1936 edition, and my first cookbook on my marriage in 1977 was the then current edition. I still use it daily.Sorry, I won't be wasting my money on this one. If there were negative stars available, it would get several."
3,good cookbook but oversights,"If I had reviewed this cookbook a week ago, I would have given it five stars. But this weekend, an event occurred that changed my mind.I bought an ice cream maker. Naturally the first place I looked for ice cream recipes, traditional and new, was The New Joy Of Cooking. And there was not a one! No sherbet, no sorbet, no frozen yogurt, not even any just plain vanilla ice cream!I just couldn't believe it, so I called a friend and she searched, too. Nada! She then looked through her older Joy Of Cooking and found dozens of recipes.I can (possibly) understand that ice cream is not as exciting as tilapia and chapatis, but it is still an American staple. I think the New Joy Of Cooking is missing an entire section on frozen desserts, and I consider it a major oversight."
2,A Great Disappointment. . .,"I have an older edition: ISBN 0-02-604570-2, possibly the forty-second printing of 1986. We looked forward to the *ALL NEW* *ALL PURPOSE* Joy of Cooking, thinking all the old goodies would be there, PLUS new things which have come into everyday kitchen life in the past 20 years. ""All new"" is right - so much of the old has vanished. I'll give this copy away and get instead another copy of the 1986 version."
4,New text formatting reduces ease of use.,"In the previous edition of this wonderful cookbook the ingredients were a distinctive bold text. In this edition, the embolded text is weak and we didn't purchase."
3,"Great content, LOUSY MANUFACTURING","I use this book a lot. The publisher chose to cut costs by perfect-binding 1156 pages, a big NO-NO. (Perfect binding is the kind of glued binding used for paperbacks, but they at least have the added strength of the paper-back cover.) Here the perfect-bound pages are inserted into a hard-cover case, and have no support. The binding broke after two or three openings, pretty bad for a book you want to use often."
2,New is not always better,"I bought this to replace my vintage 1973 wedding gift edition which had fallen apart from overloving use. This new edition deleted all but one of my favorite recipes from the older book. It wasn't until I tried to develop a vegetarian meal that some of the dishes listed as ""veegtarian"" in the menu section and index included chicken broth or other meat products. I was disappointed after 26+ years of a previous edition being my favorite cookbook - I bought an earlier edition that was available in paperback to replace ""old faithful."""
2,Bring back Granny Rom!,"A big let-down. I happily bought the ""New Joy of Cooking"", figuring my old sauce-speckled copy could use an update. When I got the new one home, I found that it had been yuppiefied! Recipes for tzimmes, whatever they are. And tea eggs. And pork satay. No more ""Supper and Buffet Dishes"". No instructions on freezing food! No section for vegetarian dishes. And woe betide us, no ""Fudge Pie"", the most begrimed and be-chocolated page in my old ""Joy"". My advice, buy the earlier edition, and give this one a pass."
3,Joy of Cooking,"Not quite as good as the original, but, nevertheless has good new material. I'm glad I didn't toss the old one I have."
1,Trash,I don't like it's language; different format. A poor imitation of the original! Ought to be removed from circulation.
1,"Only because there is not a ""no star"" option","The 1975 edition was a great book with wonderful insight and hints regarding foods, igredients and recipes. This new version is but a ""microwave companion"" with most of the original good advice and ingredient intelligence, along with the personality of the book, carefully edited out.The original is still available and well worth the money. The new version is suitable for starting fires."
4,"Layout problems, excessive goat cheese","Although this is still a comprehensive kitchen bible, it has lost much of its clean layout and concise editing. Now, pithy comments by Irma & family are replaced by gushing ""Perfect"" ""marvelous"" comments of no value. The text and icons are much less useful (and less consistent) than in previous editions. Tiny type with more white space make it impossible to read while actually cooking. Like Mrs. R's original, popular international dishes are well represented. Goat cheese is over represented. The book now suffers from ""too many cooks"" but probably remains indispensable. However, hang on to your earlier editons."
4,My absolute favorite...,"I love this book. I have cooked everything from appetizers to desserts from this cookbook. The Potato Skins were a huge hit last New Year's Eve. I love the mix of traditional and ethnic recipes, as well as the easy to follow ingredient lists and instructions. Whether I'm serving guests or my own picky kids, this is where I look first."
1,Worthless Garbage,"The original version of Joy is a strong contender for the best cookbook ever written. In this modern re-write, the new editors have completely demolished a venerable and valuable classic.I am not sure what sort of stuff the new editors were smoking when they came up with the idea for this re-write of Joy, but they must gotten a hold of some really good stuff, judging by the peculiar results. As it stands, it is mostly a cut-and-paste affair, cribbing from many cookbooks you probably already have. Note carefully that the ""new"" material is of substantially lower quality and value than the original material. It is now a typical trade hardback that you would expect to find in the cut-out bin at the book store. I am not sure why the authors thought it necessary to do this re-write. Any intelligent editor would have torpedoed the manuscript.This revision of a venerable classic is a waste of perfectly good trees."
1,Doesn't Live up to the Original,Growing up the only cookbook we every used was the original Joy of Cooking which was a fabulous reference. I recently looked at the new edition and didn't like it at all! Very hard to understand a recipe - so many recipes 'refer' you to other pages and you rarely find a simple recipe with a list of ingredients and instructions. They should have stuck with the old format. Not recommended.
1,"If I could give this negative stars, I would.","This is, without question, one of the worst cookbooks that I've ever had the misfortune of looking at. I use the OLD, reliable, Joy of Cooking as a springboard for recipe inspiration and modification. I received this ""hunk of junk"" as a holiday present, and it has MAYBE been opened twice. They got rid of all of the sections that I used on a regular basis, and replaced them with poorly-written sections, that have very little bearing on what I would actually cook at home on any sort of regular basis. Perhaps in the future, the publisher will actually come out with a revised version worth acquiring; until then, AVOID this one, buy the older version, it's more redeeming."
4,Very helpful,"Wonderful for the beginner or pro, but I love it for the basic instruction on how to cook anything...I refer to it often as I create my own recipes."
2,The new book is not an improvement over the old.,"The ""new"" Joy of Cooking is missing many recipes and techiniques that people have come to rely upon in the older version of the book. While the older version served as a reference for pretty much everything, the newer one is a pale comparison."
5,Loved it,The bowl arrived in perfect condition and made a lovely Christmas gift for a Friendly Village collector. Glad to find it.
3,Disappointed,"I loved the bowl but I had placed an order for 12 of their place setting of Johnson Brothers Friendly Village to match the bowl and Amazon cancelled the order. These items were available when I purchased them, they were in stock and would be delived before Christmas. But, I feel I got these place setting at such a great price they didn't want to sell them to me and cancelled my order. I don't think they thought someone would order 12 of them. I have purchased a lot of things from Amazon but this is really disappointing. I really wanted these dishes for my Christmas table. Don't let them do that to you."
4,Daughter loves this!,Very sweet and made rather well- daughter is four and has next to her bed and has to tuck her baby in before going to bed--rather cute! Can be wheeled all over house- so that is very nice--- cute and very feminine!
1,Save your $,"I bought this for My Dewalt 12"" compound miter saw. I thought it would be nice to add the laser to it.It is very easy to install, it just replaces the outside blade washer. There are no adjustments and the unit dosen't fit exactly like the orgininal washer, the shape of the ""flats"" on the Avenger are not the same (it is universal for many saws).You have to start the saw to activate the laser (turns on at 500 rpm). The problem is it will cut about a 1/32"" off the laser line. It should cut right on the edge of the line or the center of the line. So you have to estimate where the cut will be.Your better off with the saw off, bringing the blade down to your piece of work to see where the cut is. Or with the blade running sight down the blade.The saftey feature of the laser should be to line up the cut with the blade not spinning, thats not the case with the Avenger. The blade must spin to activate."
3,No Wonder Irving Berlin Hated The Film,"Sorry but I've waited years for this release--just like the rest of you. But what I remembered as being superb is merely mediocre I'm afraid. Unfortunately, it's all due to Betty Hutton's overacting, mugging, and generally chewing up the scenery and slaughtering Irving Berlin's score with a sledge hammer approach which produces a one note performance--LOUD! Even at her most desperately ill, Garland was somehow able to dredge up more from her inner resources than Hutton is able to deliver on her best day. Still, it is a somewhat entertaining film and I'm glad to have added it to my collection."
1,I'm disappointed.,This product came from the UK and I could not use it on my DVD Player. This was not clearly stated when I ordered it. It took three weeks to get here. Sending it back is not worth the $10 I paid for it. I feel like I was took.Dolores Clark
5,There Really Is No Businesss Like Show Business!,"Annie Get Your Gun is my favort play.And now it is my favort movie. I loved being in that play even though i was only 11 years old i still loved doing it.As I got older I found out that there was a movie and when I got the movie I could not stop watching it, and now my future goal would Be Palying Annie Oakley. And I think Annie would be proud."
1,Disappointed altogether,"I was anxiously awaiting my copy of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN and when I finally went to watch it, I got a message on the screen saying something like this was not available in my district. Very discouraging. I may not order again like this."
2,Decent!,The DVD is a good one....BUT THE FLAMES SHOULD HAVE WON THE CUP IN GAME 6! THE PUCK CROSSED THE LINE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE WON THAT GAME! THE LIGHTINING GOT HANDED THE CUP BY THE NHL OFFICES IN TORONTO BY NOT REVIEWING THAT!
5,Was a great help for my care plans!,"Until this book, I didn't have a simple reference for all the NANDA diagnoses with interventions/rationales. This one is laid out very nicely specifically for care plans. The only thing that could have improved this book would have been to include more reviews of each topic, but then again its a CARE PLANNING book and if it offered more, it would weigh 50 pounds. So I thought it did CARE PLANNING very well!"
3,good game for the most part,"this game graphically and in many other ways is better than Street Sk8er, the levels are mcuh better and you have to work at the moves instead of pressing ""X"". however, whoever made this game must be a poser cos what once had good punk music now has lame metal music. not something that you'd want to skate to. how many other skating games do you play that skate to Static-X and Deftones? especially when the first one had all punk bands. the music was what Street Sk8er had going for it the most. also, the announcer on this game is 10 times more annoying than the first one. so, aside from all that, it is a good game but there are much better games out there for us skate punks such as grind session, tony hawk, and some others that i have yet to check out."
5,what do you want?,"If you are wanting your child to learn to read, these are the books for you. If you are wanting your child to be entertained, then you need to go shell out the money for ""Hooked on Phonics"" or some program like that. The above reviewers all complained that the book had no pictures, as the print copies do. As a home schooling mother of 7 children, 3 of which have graduated, I have taught all my children to read with readers from either the early 1900's or late 1800's. I find the pictures to be a distraction to the young children anyway, as they are looking at the pictures attempting to make the story say what the picture tells them. As I said, you need to know what you're wanting before you download these books: a good, solid foundation in reading or a feel, good, story time?"
5,Perfect for kids!,"My 17 month old son absolutely LOVES these claves, and he has been playing them ever since we purchased our first set about 9 months ago. We have since purchased several additional sets to makes sure we have plenty around the house for him to play with. I love to encourage a love of music in him, and these have made a great addition to quite a good collection of other instruments he has so far.In my opinion, these do have quite a nice sound if an adult hits them just right. I can get some serious volume and resonation from them! Enjoy! AM"
3,Wood claves are a great musical toy,"My toddler likes these, but maybe I like them more than he does? He prefers to use them as drumsticks, but as he ages I think he will get the hang of it. I am sure they're not for a young age but they make a fine sound. Lots of fun for singing around the house with the kiddos!*****Ok, one year later and he has only touched them a couple times. I'm still a fan of the claves!"
4,Not the movie directed by Joe Dante,"This is not the movie directed by Joe Dante as cross-referenced to Internet Movie Database, but rather a very good documentary of the tumultuous 12 years of American History following the Civil War."
1,isnt height adjustable.,"although this is wide and heavy duty. It is not adjustable. the others are, wish I had noticed that before I bought it."
3,Only Sean Penn acting is great,"Maybe the best Sean Penn's perfomance ( he is my gavorite actor with Robert De Niro ), but i didin`t like the movie, because i cannot understand how a woman ( Robin Wright ) can walk away from her two daughters, in order to escape with Penn's character. Travolta gives a simple perfomance as the new husband."
4,"Actually, 4 1/2","I like electronic music from afar. 10-12 CDs of that genre satisfy my needs completely. One of them is this ""Experience"" which proves that when a band (or a musician)is not ""commercially recognized"" it is free of cliches and is capable of creating good music. As soon as they experience big commercial success the music becomes less and less interesting. The only exception is, probably, Tom Waits"
5,Prodigy at it's BEST,"This is definately the best Prodigy CD. Fat of the Land is to metalish almost to be called techno. Jilted Generation is also a great CD. I love Fat of the Land, don't get me wrong, but the true Prodigy sound is found in Experience. Some of the most creative, crazy, mind blowing beats will be found on this disk."
2,Carbon copy CD,"This CD sounds like all the other nu-metal thats coming out lately, ill nino and no one. The only thing thats slightly any good about this CD is the way the drummer uses some nice accents but thats all. The lyrics are absolutely horrible."
4,Excellent Dog Training Resource,"Terry has done a good job of explaining the variety of different reasons dogs can bark to excess. By encouraging the owners to first analyze and understand the problem from the dog's point of view, she helps the owner take the first step in resolving the problem. Every dog owner needs to know how to manage their pets barking behavior, and dog trainers, too, will benefit from this ready-reference type resource! Get this book! This is on the recommended reading list of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers,and of the National Association of Dog Obedience Instructors."
1,DON'T BUY THIS RECORDING!!!,"**PLEASE READ**There is a bootleg of Frank's music called ""The Truth 2"" being released on the Internet WITHOUT the permission of Frank McComb.**Frank McComb IS NOT affiliated with the release of ""The Truth 2""This is very unfortunate for Frank as he is in no way profiting from the blood sweat and tears that he has put into this music and by supporting this album, you are not supporting Frank McComb but rather someone who is trying to profit from the works of Frank McComb"
3,Overwhelming for New Players,This is a good reference book for experienced players-- but don't by this book if you are trying to learn method! No explanation of method or practical use. Really...it's just a scale dictionary
4,Schwinn Sting-Ray (Enthusiast Color Series),"I liked the book very much, but I was trying to get a message to Liz Fried. First, I wish that it contained information on how to purchase bikes, products, accessories, etc. Also, on page 81, she states that the Koal Krate and Grape Krate are urban myths. Last October 1999, I purchased a brand new limited addition single speed Grape Krate from my Schwinn Dealer. Schwinn has rereleased two of the single speed Krates (apple & orange) and the Grape Krate was a limited addition. I am coming forward as she has asked in the book and would be happy to have it photogaphed if she wished to update her book. Please forward this information to her."
3,"Yawn, read the others in the series","Altough I love the Aliens book series, this one was a let down for me. For some reason I just couldn't get into the story. The authors didn't do a very good job of building up the characters. I found myself not really caring if they lived or died. Secondly, there were way too many people in the story. I think the novels where there are only a few people trying to stay alive are much more interesting and suspenseful. I mean, there were like 150 good-guys, way too many in an Aliens book. And finally, the ending was so stupid and predictable I almost laughed. The evil scientist dies and the heroines escape, couldn't see that coming. Contrary to how harsh I sound, it was a pretty good book, although it got boring towards the end. The Schofields are good writers and I've enjoyed some of the other books they've written, but this one just didn't measure up."
5,THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK,Well i thought this was great book even though it was boring sumtimes but it was cool how the space marines live and the new alien is cool
2,Makes no sense.,"What really bothered me about this book was the complete lack of accuracy when describing the aliens. This book refers to drones four to five times the size of humans.....wha? And the new species, the rogue, is said to rival the queen in size at almost fifteen meters tall. Fifteen meters? Sorry, last time I watched aliens the queen was about fifteen FEET tall."
4,Enjoyable read,"This is the first book I have read by this author. If you like the medical thriller genre, then you should pick up this book.The main character is a psychiatrist with his share of flaws. The mystery itself was not all that great, but the writing style is very enjoyable, and you find yourself wanting to read more by Keith Ablow. Already, I have started reading Psychopath and look forward to reading all of them."
2,A predictable plot that serves Ablow's delusional fantasies,"This is the 3rd book I've read by this author and it will be the last. Although some of the character development is intriguing, Ablow makes careless errors (the victim begins as a five month old baby and changes to a three month old midway through the book, and the father invests in Acribat (?) Software). Clevenger is a thinly veiled portrayal of the author who apparently fancies himself irrestible to gorgeous women despite his many character flaws.I lost interest in the plot halfway through the book and Clevenger's lack of professionalism is serious distraction to the story."
2,Whiny Shrink,I think the main character-Frank- needs more therapy. His issues distracted from the story to such an extent that I couldn't get into the mystery. He needs to keep his professional self separate. This is the first-and last =book I'll read from this author.
5,Very good cable for the price,"Gold plated for good conduction, works perfect for hooking a computer up to a tv monitor, picture is very sharp and clear. Very good deal."
3,"Take a basic noir plot and ""look,""","then give the whole thing a half-turn to the left. That's the best way to describe this film, I think ... a basic story that's just a bit out of kilter. And, of course, that's what makes it so watchable. Billy Bob and Gandolfini are damn near excellent, as is Frances. It's not a film that moves smoothly along; you have to stay with it a bit, but it's worth it, promise."
1,"It drags like a wet cigar, chomped half to death in the corner of my mouth","Coen Brother's hit and miss film-making style did it again with this miss. I am a HUGE fan of their work, and an enormous fan of noir. But this was just too dragged out. The cast was great, the characters were great, the film was beautiful, but it was just boring. The narrative was ridiculously cliche, even for the neo-noir genre. It really broke my heart. I had hoped for sooooooooo much more. Go read some Fante, Faust, or rent some good ol' Mike Hammer DVDs."
3,Boring and a disappointment.,"This was one of Billy Bob Thornton's three major releases during the fall of 2001, the others being ""Bandits"" and ""Monster's Ball."" Though many touted his performance as a quiet, cuckolded barber looking for a break as brilliant, I couldn't tell the difference between acting bored and boring acting.Thornton's the best thing about this movie, but that's because I thought the movie was an uninspired dud. Frances McDormand and James Gandolfini are on screen far too little, and her character's given little to do. The twisty plot isn't really all that twisty, for you can see the consequences coming a mile away. Knowing it's a film noir homage, as well, you're clued in to the fact that none of this is going to end well.Beautifully photographed in black-and-white, the film is unbearably tedious, particularly its third act with Tony Shalhoub's performance as a smarmy lawyer injecting the story of the film with much-needed energy and narrative color."
4,"Heavens to Betsy, Birdie!","What a great movie. Only for movie lovers, that is. Most people will find it kinda boring... My 24 year old sister fell asleep 15 min into the movie, I guess you can't account for taste! Then a movie buff friend like me found it wierd and funny, black & white yet colorful....Anyways, see it first."
2,Slow. Dull. Stupid.,"The negative reviews of this slow-moving silly melodrama are pretty much on target. But if you wanna watch Billy Bob Thornton smoke cigarette after cigarette, this one is for you. Seriously man, this one has NOTHING going for it at all."
2,Coen's Film Noir Falls Flat,"I had high hopes during the opening shots of this film. The black and white film-noir feel was intriguing. It visually interested me...but my interest quickly waned. The character of Ed Crane, a barber who blackmails his wife's lover so he can invest the money with a guy with a bad toupee, narrates the film in a very monotone manner which almost lulled me to sleep. The pacing of the movie was painfully slow and the dialogue was uninspired, which is highly disappointing coming from the Coens. Alot of acting talent, such as Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, Tony Shaloub and James Gandolfini, went to waste in this picture. The tone of the film was flat and subdued. This is the weakest of the Coen brothers films."
2,"An art ""fillum""","Yes, this film contains some fine acting and some clever reproductions of the ""film noir"" genre from the late 1940s. But the script leaves a lot to be desired, and the directing is at times extraordinarily inadequate. How many times do we need the same shot of a man smoking, staring into the distance, and mumbling a few words of no consequence? The plot has a few twists that are unpredictable, but it's hard to follow, given the poor script. I can imagine that film studies types will find much to cluck about here. I was reminded of the many Ingmar Bergman movies I used to sit through in the 1950s, thinking them quite profound. Having grown up, I realize that they are a bore. This Coen brothers production is more boring than most. Two stars. One of the least of their works."
2,Not one of Jackie Chan`s best.,"I heard this was a really good movie, but I thought it was a bad one. Some of the fight scenes were poorly done, and the acting was bad too. If you watch it to many times it gets boring, and barely whatchable. The fight scenes were good, but minor things in the fight scenes were bad, like when Jackie hit the bad guy in the head with a bottle, it looked as if it didn`t even hit him, and then it made this loud ""BONG"" noise when it hit the bad guy. Stuff like that made the fight scenes in ""Rumble In The Bronx"" bad. I don`t think it should get five stars."
2,One of Jackie Chan's worst films.,"My god, was this film ever awful. Jackie Chan really frustrates me. He has all the qualities of a big-time movie star and more, but he insists on making these terrible movies with minimal plot and third-rate suppoting actors. I just hope to god that Jackie will try doing a project with a big-name director(why dosn't he work with John Woo again?) and competent actors. Don't bother with this film. Jackie Chan's best films are Police Story, Crime Story, First Strike, and DrunkenMaster II."
2,cute,"rumble in... montreal? this isnt Jackie Chan's best movie, but if youre a fan, youll dig it. Its entertaining, to say the least, but lacks the rawness of his older films."
3,.............,"Im a huge Jackie fan, and watching this when I was younger I thought this moive was awesome, but watching this movie now............... The only reason I gave this movie threes stars is because of the fight scenes, minus the the last fight scene which was just boring and wasnt even a fight scene. The gangs were'nt even believeable and for some reason they dubbed the actors speaking engligh into english if that makes sense. It was just really corney, not even shot in the bronx. Reading some of the other reviews, I should have took the time and tracked down the original un-cut and un-dubbed, movie with longer fight scenes and so on. Watching this movie as im older was a dissappointment."
5,What a Life,"Doris Day didn't have the perfect life everyone thought she had.She was abused by one of her husbands,her son was almost killed by Charles Manson,and her Father married an Africa American Women,that Doris loved.This book is fantastic,and no stone is unturned.I wrote to Doris Day when I bought this book in 1975,and she wrote back a beutifull letter signed in Ink.I still have this note,and Cherish it with all my memories of Doris Days great films and music she has given us over the years.I think Doris did the right thing,retiring while she was still on top,and enjoying her life with her animals,and beutifull house in Carmel."
4,Why not sell the waterproof one online?,"I have this mascara in ""aquastay"" which is the waterproof version. Its great, gives a slighly dramatic look to my lashes, but not fake. The only downside is sometimes while applying a lash might stick to another one - annoying."
4,Do a little research before,"I do think this is a good kit, I agree though that they should probably just go ahead and include the wax in the kit. I would suggest doing a little reading before just buying the kit. The instructions that come with it are pretty slimmed down but if you have some idea of the basic techniques you should have no problems with it."
5,Bobby Dazzler,"This is the best album I have ever heard. Once you have listened to it I am sure you will feel, as I always do when I listen to it, ALIVE. Go out right now and buy this album, you will be pleased you did. Mark and the lads if you read this, love you loads."
3,2.5 stars...,"I must say that when I bought this album a few years ago I was excited. But, despite the energy in the album the music really doesn't give me something to connect to like their later release of The Fat of the Land. Out of all the artists who make techno, dance, etc. music that I've been purchasing I'd have to say that this takes the cake for the album I have to force myself to listen to and when I do I find myself waiting until it is over. It is a good CD though, it is relative to your past experiences of the music within and since I have none I cannot connect. I'd much rather listen to Lunatic Calm, Chemical Bros., Oakenfold, Van Dyk, even Micro."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST,"The Prodigy are simply the best musical act around...simple as that. This cd is definitely the best by The Prodigy, but Fat of the Land comes in second. To anyone who likes good techno, you must get this cd."
1,11:14 1:26 minutes wasted,"Nothing compared to crash or like I was expecting. The movie is just a couple people who get hit by cars and slight humor to lighten the mood, but I was thoroughly disappointed. I had a guest walk out on it and I would recommend to not waste your time with this."
5,Twisted Dark Humor,"I don't buy movies, but once I saw this movie on HBO, I knew I had to have it so I could savor the twists and turns of the tales again. Five separate people, five separate story lines, all converging one night at 11:14. After watching the movie, I remember thinking that I needed to draw it all out, to better understand the criss-crossing paths of the characters. Instead, I chose to buy the movie.If you like dark humor, you'll love this movie. It's too twisted not to grab you. In fact, you're hooked in the first couple of minutes..."
3,Rather strange fare,"Very strange movie...you must pay close attention to get it all in. Every thing that happens does coincide but a few things are never answered and left hanging, so I feel it is a decent movie. But in a few areas it lacks. Patrick Swayze and Hilary Swank give great performances."
1,Doesn't work with Comcast,"This modem is on the comcast approved list, but it actually doesn't work. I got it, and had to return it after the comcast folks told me it had reached its end of life.Very frustrating and annoying experience.(more annoying though is the fact that comcast won't sell me the modem they already leased to me!)"
2,Silly,"Great stunts, decent story, good fight scenes, but some of the action was just plain silly. Most Jackie Chan movies try WAY too hard to be funny, and this one is no exception. It just isn't funny and the attempts are silly and unintelligent. They should just stick to fighting and stunts and they'll be fine. Jackie Chan is terrible at comedy."
1,Twin Dragons stinks,"I LOVE JACKIE CAN, but this was pithetic. Bad plot, bad dubbing, and all around stupid. Skip this and see First Strike, Who am I?,Project A or Supercop."
1,Stick with an Original,"Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. For ANY of HK movies, ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though."
2,"Good, but not great...","I thought that this movie was good, but I saw some flaws in it too.. When the ""Twins"" were in the bathroom, it seemed that the Shoulder of the twins had run together! It even looked like the Jackie on the left looked like he was matted in! The magic of the scene was lost... The Story could have been better too. The people that kept fainting all through the movie,was rather stupid at times... Sorry Jackie... You struck out with this one..."
3,A Look into America From Outside Eyes,"American culture from days past is sometimes interesting to look at. Nowhere can a less biased view of the 1950's be found than in the eyes of a foreigner. If that is what you seek then this is a good book. The plot kicks off pritty well. The book draws you in, bringing forth events that make you think. I reccomend reading to page 197 to anyone. Then strange things start to happen. Labro goes on for a few chapters about springtime. With the kinky/racey stuff long-gone, the reader might as well quit now. There are a few high moments before the end but it doesn't come near the intrest found in the first half. So overall I give this book a decent score because it is based on something that really happened. We can't all expect our lives to be interesting. If you're a book lover, you'll like it. If you speak french, it might amuse you. If you're looking for something more enlightening to read, try Ayn Rand."
1,what's taking so long?,well i ordered this CD on 12-18-01 and right now its 12-30-01...they said it would be here around the 22nd-25th uhh...can i please find out what happened to my CD that was supposed to be a x-mas gift?
2,who is this guy,This album isnt all that it is cracked up to be. For me there is only a couple of good songs on the album (pony and holler).The rest of the songs are not anything amazing and frankly made me fall asleep. Im not saying its the worst album ive ever heard im just saying its one of the worst.Ok pony is a great song and the beat to it is tight but what the hells going on with the rest of the album. was he drunk when he released it?The ladies probably love him because of his looks and his nice body but men can see right through that. Men dont get impressed by him takin his shirt off. The men actually look at the lyrics of the song and how well the song is presented and from a mans point of view it really is dreadful.If you want pony go and download it and dont bother buying the album. I made that mistake.
5,Gin-U-Ine,"He is 100% on tha real. Ginuwine is the best R&B singer out there him and Sisqo can dance like WOAH but SIsqo cannot and willnot ever be able to cmpare to ginuwine. His song PONY will forever be a classic and it will always be tight. That is the best song to play at a party if you and that ""sombody"" wanna get close and dance. You feel me?"
1,Cheap hard drive,"I have had this thing for about 5 weeks now. I thought it was great as well, I had about 15 recordings done and was happy with everything the machine had to offer. Until the hard drive crashed. Tascam needs to seriously consider the parts used in this machine's construction. One day worked fine, next day it wouldn't even boot. Now I have to send it back, and try and remember the songs I recorded (which are usually improv.)"
1,Hard disk failed again,"When I first got it, I thought it was great. Easy to use, adequate sound quality (not great). Then, as other people have said, the hard disk started grinding, and I lost all my songs. I sent it back to Tascam with a note for them to send me recovered songs if they could, and they did not. I got a new one which worked fine. Then yesterday, the hard disk locked and I lost the song I was working on. This time I could retrieve my other songs, so I mastered them, but the hard disk still grinds and I'm going to have to send it back again. Obviously a design flaw, and not the only one (why doesn't it have a back lit LCD? Why no digital inputs?). Don't buy this unless you want to lose all your songs."
4,Does the job,"This chair folds easily and my assistant has no trouble lifting and fitting it into a standard size trunk of a car. Larger back wheels make it easier to push than normal transport chairs. I have a sensitive cervical spinal cord injury so I like that it rides more smoothly than other transport chairs. Downside: something about the way it ""sits"" is different from the same model chair I bought last year, so it's not quite as comfortable, thus 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Crockpot Cooking,This book has many recipes for the crockpot and will enable you to cook any meal to impress. The index is self explanatory and will guide you to any recipe with easy steps to take the stress off cooking.
2,Questionable quality,"Good price, but the connectors at one end of the cable are loose irregardless of what I plug them into. The slightest movement makes them fall off the equipment they are plugged into. I slightly squeezed the outer wings of the connectors to make them hold a little and plugged them into the TV since that is moved least frequently. I don't notice any signal quality problems despite the loose connections."
4,Good stuff,Bought/read this anthology back in '83 I think. The stories are still powerful and make great reading - was overjoyed to find it available and in very good shape.
3,Not what is pictured,This product is similar to what is pictured but not what I was expecting. I'm sorry that I ordered two of them now.
3,Only OK,"Puppy loved it immediately, but it's not the greatest. Those extra squeakers are needed - she has already killed one of them - now this puppy has had several of her toys for weeks without a squeaker dying. Also the velcro spot inside the snake mouth where you exchange the squeaker is a magnet to a curious puppy - so the velcro is going to be very short lived.All in all she is having fun with it, but I limit time with it and strongly urge frequent inspection of puppy toys."
3,something to consider,It is important that we not swing back to an exclusivley feminine deity. It seems that most of these books are happy to paint old goddess religions as the ultimate utopian example. We are made up of both genders. Focusing soley on one gender as divine is harmful to everyone.
5,His tory of our present predicament,"This is a very interesting book containing parts of history which have not been told. It shows how we have become a world of violence- both to people and nature. It also shows how we may chose a different path of equity , caring and respect for all people and nature. We have a long way to go, but nature will- and is- becoming violent because the actions we perpetuate upon it are not caring or respectful."
5,Other Options for the Human Race,"It was wonderful and freeing to read this book. Even if there were some oversimplifications, how liberating to have other possible explanations of and options for human history! This book has inspired me to question and reexamine beliefs and attitudes that are so ubiquitous in our society that it's hard to even know that we hold them, let alone question them. I'll always be grateful to Ms. Eisler for helping me find greater freedom in all aspects of my life."
1,It was terrible,"This book, while being an, 'Introduction' is not at all that. The author has little command of the English language and, while he does have great knowledge regarding the philosophy of logic, is unable to communicate it in a method capable of actually introducing a beginner to the world of logic. The Tractatus makes more sense than this maze of jargon."
3,Fun and versatile but don't drive in the dark......,"A good representation of all the Porsche models ever manufactured. Many different tracks and levels. Beautiful landscapes and cars. A must for any Porsche enthusiast. Electronic Arts generally always comes up with the best racing games manufactured. HOWEVER... The night tracks are almost impossible to drive on much less qualify on. The graphics shows the car has lights yet they are non-existent when it comes to driving. It is easy to get stuck on a night course without any idea of how to get back on track. Its like being in the pitch black of night. Would have given this game five stars but because of this major oversight in night track programming, I'm only giving it three. Other than this, an excellent game for any avid racer."
3,Only for Porsche crazys,"I have all the NFS game except this one, i just tried it with a friend. Same quality as usual, but i think you better be very interested by Porsche to go to buy this game. In my opinion, the best NFS game was the 1st one, because of the road course in the forest, (you don't race around a race track), then come the NFS High Stakes, because of the High Stakes mode, car upgrades, and the special car (the one you can't buy, especially the Porsche 911 is great, but you need to be good to win with it). NFS 2 was quite Ok, not enough track and cars. The one I didn't like was NFS 3. No felling in the car, not very realistic."
1,Alundra 2,"I have played some very bad games in my ten years of gaming but this game tops them all. When I first bought it I hoped that it would keep up the excellent standards that Alundra set. I was wrong. This game is totally rubish as far as I am concerned. While the graphics may look good they become very annoying. The music is o.k but the worst features of this game have to be the lack of a decent storyline and the camera angles. Overall, u think that any real RPGest should go out and buy a decent game such as FFVII."
2,Aflumpa 2!,"I was so disappointed with this! The original Alundra was fantastic boasting a cracking manga intro (although this was a bit revealing), a good solid game engine and above all gameplay that worked! Here none of the above apply...What shocked me the most at first was how much the graphics had been degraded! Instead of nice to look at cartoony graphics here they have adopted graphics recently took on by Shadow madness (that's not a good thing by the way!) Surely a sequel should move forwards not backwards?To make matters worse there seemed to be an epmphasis on bad camera work! I was so sick and tired of adjusting the camera to attempt an impossible jump! I really had high expectations of this, considering the success of the original... My advice to you is leave this alone and catch up with original, as it is superior in every way possible."
1,Wish I hadn't bought it...,"To be honest, I think this is one of the worst Playstation games I've ever experienced. I LOVED the original, and bought this under the assumption that it would reflect all the great qualities of Alundra.....sad to say it does not. The 3D format was an admirable idea, but it limits the actual length of the game to an unbearable level. One of the originals best attractions was it's immersiveness due to it's long duration, but this is lost in the sequel. I feel so strongly against this game I've gone out of my way to write this, it's a BIG disappointment."
3,A good fun movie,Riot is a great movie that was desperately in need of some editing. Many of the characters in this movie were given far too much time considering that they were either about to die or not be seen again in the movie. The fight scenes were great but much of the action had to be sacrificed to the movies gloomy lighting which made a little under half the fighting a matter of guessing what the heck happened. This movie tried to keep the fights unique by using a fun sound track and some professional sounding scary music. The real applause go to the action scenes like the one with the helicopter (although the fire looked very fake it did look very cool) and the parking lot scene where Gary Daniels runs from two cars trying to hit him. This was a good movie for those willing to wait for the story to come back in but I would prefer that it went into a little less detail of things that didn't matter
5,Great,Very good buy.Recomend this phone for people who do not have a corded phone.It will still work when electric goes out.
4,More English Humor.,This is a low budget cheesy movie that is saved by the cast. This group of actors are so good together.
3,It's Okay,"I love this series, and had never heard of this movie. It had all the right elements, but missed the mark. The sexy knickers bit had been done before on the show, more successfully. All in all, it was just Okay. For a real laugh watch the original series."
1,Don't Bother Watching this,I LOVED this show with its quip humor and fantastic cast but this movie is the WORST i have ever seen in my life. I can't believe money actually went into this project because it is the randomest script i have ever seen. theys start off going on vacation in a crappy hotel in spain and then everybody is trying to get into each other's pants but then guerillas break out into a full out war in the hotel.... HORRIBLE! by the time it finishes you can't believe you spent your precious time watching this.
1,Awful,I see why this cosys $6. The movie is a repeat of several episodes. It begins in the store using the Grace Brother sponsored vacation storyline. It is very boring and the plot is non-existent. Save your money and buy the series.
5,Love it!!,I love to watch this series on pbs and just had to order this movie. I think it is just great. For the decade it was the dialog is unbelievable. Planning on ordering the whole series.
4,Very helpful,Is a great book but you will need to buy the internet package when purchased used. Keep that in mind.The supplier expedited the shipment; very good service.
5,A must for all ages!,A wonderfull book and song that show how children work togother through love. Beautifull illustrations with a simple but wonderfull message that even an adult would appreciate.
1,this phone is a junk!,"I purchased this phone to serve as one of my emergency gadgets,in case of power outage.But,I was terribly disappointed.It will take minutes before the call is processed.You also,have to press hard to dial the number,oftentimes it doesnt work at all.I replaced it with ATT slimline phone and I can tell significantly the difference,just from the sound of the dial tone.I was compelled to write this review as I dont want any prospective buyers to be victimized by G.E..This is the worst electronic product I have ever purchased in my life.I will have second thoughts of buying any GE products in the future!"
4,Suprisingly Good,"I get alittle critical when I try new author since they seem to fall short of my old favorites. But Logan has written a good book for her second novel. I thought both Peter and Emily were wonderful characters and they book seemed to flow fairly well. I hate when authors get off to a great start and lag in the middle. But this author gave me fairly fast moving book throughout the book. They seemed to have good chemistry together not great but good. I am a stickler for chemistry. Some feels forced others have none at all and others have fireworks. This book did not have fireworks but it was still good. I liked the plot of the book, I found it interesting and I liked him be a Runner and not some titled lord. I will be eager to read other books by the author in the future. Good Read!"
4,My 7 year old son loves this one.,"My son age 7 would rate this movie 5 stars, but his sisters (ages 4 and 9) don't agree. He has watched it 5 times, then tired of it. For the girls, it was once each. For me and mom once was definitely enough. So. There you have a qualified 4 star rating depending on your age and gender. Try any of the land Before time movies especially the first three or the brave little toaster if you looking for alternatives to disney."
2,Absolutely useless,"I own a Sony Cybershot DSC-P72 and I bought a 4-pack of these batteries so I could have backups. Even after fully charging, they ran out in about 1/4 of the time of the Sony batteries that came with the camera. One freshly-charged set ran out after about ten minutes while my camera was USB-connected to my PC. I put another charged pair in and the camera wouldn't turn on at all.I put my Sony batteries (partially-charged!) back in and voila, the camera worked again.I would not recommend these if you have a Cybershot. Stick to the Sony batteries over <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000996BL/qid=1107366870/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-2696869-7453763"">here</a>"
1,Very boring,"All the other reviewers are talking about how good the acting and directing is but none of them really say it is an enjoyable movie. The plot is just plain bad. At one point the two main characters are just sitting down pointing guns at each other. Then one gets up and runs away and the other chases him. Why didn't they just shoot? Then when Jack Nickolson does shoot, the guy gets hit in the neck, stands up and walks away like nothing happened. I might want someone to watch this just to see how horrible a movie can be. Half of it takes place in a strip club that has nothing to do with the plot. And there are many other unimportant scenes that just don't fit in and don't make sense. I guess they needed lots of filler. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie."
3,Searching for soundtrack,"Does anybody out there know of a soundtrack of the film? The film had songs by Jewel, Springsteen etc. Please post here."
3,it looks so real..,"I got for my 18month old daughter who is crazy about the ""itsy bitsy spider"" rhyme. She has named him itsy :) and she finds him cute. Although I must say, this spider has scared some of my friends..lol!"
3,Fuel Belts are just Good Ideas,"I used it for a half marathon, and I was very happy that I had it since the water stations were not set up properly. I only wish the pack part of the belt was a little bigger so it could fit a cellphone, but other than that I would say it is a good product."
5,The Best There Is,"Kurt Elling is like a GOD to me. His voice, his main instrument, is REAL, emotional, multi-layered. He does vocal improvisations, putting his on-the-spot improvised lyrics to famous instrumental solos, a technique originally mastered by John Hendricks (Hendricks and Ross)who were famous in the fifties and who also appears on the disk. Can't wait until he comes to New York to gig."
5,a must have,great. a must have alice in chains.i hate i waited so long to get it but glad i have it now.
4,Good Album,"If you are an Alice In Chains fan, you will not be disappointed in this album. A must have for your AIC collection!"
2,Alice In Chains does not sound as good accoustic,"I have every release from Alice In Chains and I love them more than the next person. However, they do not sound nearly as good acoustic than the original releases. The only thing this CD really provides is variety from the usual hard rocking music from Alice In Chains. The song lineup is less than stellar, with lots of six and eight minute songs where the band just jams. So a person could easily fall asleep listening to mellow guitar riffs and light drumming. If you are looking for a better way of listening to some good music from Alice In Chains, get the Best of the Box CD or their Live CD."
5,Awsome,I am a pretty big fan and I have to say this is my new favorite. On this album the guys play like they still love the music. The unplugged renditions rock harder than you would think. I highly recommend!
4,Fit perfectly.,"This latch was a perfect fit for my sliding glass door. It took less than 10 minutes to install, and took only minor adjustment for the hook to catch."
1,Misleading and discriminatory,"This book is misleading about the events that lead to the arrest of Kevin Mitnick. If you would like to know the truth read ""The Fugitive Game"""
1,Not so great,"After reading the other reviews on this book, I felt that it may be a good read. I was mistaken. This book was sketcky, boring, and poorly written. It should only be used for casual bathroom reading. ""Easy to put down"""
5,great,Perfect for any student. This dictionary has multiple color picture pages as well as a complete written dictionary.
3,Good record of your baby's first year.,"Nice - it comes with stickers to remind you of things to be watching for during the first year. Also, I like that there is a place for a photo in every month so you can see how your child changed throughout the year. Happy with it - also bought the Zoophabet Baby Memory Book. I like the Memory Book better than the calendar but it matched so I got both."
1,Karaoke Home Recording?,"OK performance for an oldies night in the community park, or in an old folks home. To pay for, even in MP3 distortion, when original, rerecording, and professional impersonator tracks are readily available, pass."
4,No ATA/133 controller card,"The technical specifications indicate an ATA133 IDE controller card is included in the box. It is not!In the box: Hard drive, MaxBlast installation software, Ultra ATA cable, ***NO*** Maxtor Ultra ATA/133 card for Windows, user's manual (English only), and screws"
1,NEVER STORE CRITICAL DATA ON THIS DRIVE,I bought this drive about 1 year ago and didn't use it very often. It totally failed just 10 days out of warranty.
4,Great Book!,A must read for anyone with an ADHD child. The individual question format really works well. Instead of having to read through stuff you may already know about you can find just the answer needed.
3,a,"This album is only good if you like live albums. Every song on this cd is great, but hearing them live makes every song terrible!!!"
1,30 day money back guarantee?? Ha!,"I purchased from this company and had to return the item, which I did within days of receiving it. I contacted them 3 times about my returned item and I never got one response. You cannot contact the company directly only through a form you have to fill out on thier website. They have no phone listed. I never got my money returned and I don't have the product. If you buy from them you better hope you don't have to do a refund or exchange. I got ripped off!"
3,30x loupe,Pretty good but have a hard time telling the difference from my 10x loupe. Clear glass lens and nice holder.
3,low quality,"its a really low quality can not rally ask for more for this price but i wont rally last more then a few months. the scews start getting lose, if you want quality buy something more expencive. but it is a great price for what you are getting for."
3,"Overall, good beginners loupe",I found this loupe to very good for me as a beginning loupe. The quality of the product is good as well as its functionality.
4,A VERY GOOD 30X LOUPE,"I AM QUITE SATISFIED WITH THIS LOUPE, MOST PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING ITS HIGH QUALITY AT A LOW PRICE. I ALSO SOMETIMES USE A COMBINATION 10X/20X LOUPE."
4,Not bad for the money,"The price is amazingly low. It comes directly from China in a padded envelope. Very handy. Certainly not professional quality, but fine for my purposes. I keep in my desk to read very very small print and to perhaps locate a sliver on a finger. Magnification might not be 30x but seems a little stronger than 10x. Optics seem fine and distortion free. Lens set in shiny metal frame and comes in small plastic case. Hey, for so little money I ordered another one."
3,Jeweler's Loupe 30X21mm Chrome Plated,This product works OK but not all that great! Mine broke off completely at the opening in and out area within a week and I had only used it three times before it just broke off as I opened it. I don't think they are worth but a 1.00! You only get what you pay for!
2,10x not 30x,"Well, it is a nice little magnifier and comes in a nice little box, but it is not a 30x. It is almost exactly a 10x magnifier."
2,Got what I paid for.,"Very low price consistent with the product I received. It's a rather cheap loupe, but it cost almost nothing. Shipping from China to a VERY long time and I wish I'd known from where it was coming before I hit the final purchase button. This will be an acceptable backup to the one I had to buy when I figured out this one would take so long to get here."
1,low power,"I bought this for higher magnification, but it is no higher power than my 10x loupe and is even a lesser quality than my puritest 10x loupe( I can see more clearly and with better magnification with my 10x)."
5,Perfect!,"Wonderful loupe! Small, powerful and easy.The price was right, and delivery was swift and smooth.No problems, no complaints, and very pleased."
3,Not 30x,"This is a nice loupe but it's only 10x. I have one of identical size 21mm and side by side looking at something there's no difference. Again, still a nice 10x loupe for the money but not what I paid for :("
4,I can see pixels!,Does the job just fine -- I use this when reviewing pixels on an iPad or iPhone app I'm developing. This shows pixels even on a Retina Display.
4,30x Jeweler's Loupe,Purchase was made to use in finding details in rocks. It can also be used in a survival kit as a fire starter.
2,Predictable and Boring!,"Another dissapointment from what used to be my favorite author. Granted, this was not his own work, but I found this book to be a real waste of time. Very little suspense, and even at only 400 pages, there was a lot of fluff inserted.If this keeps up I'll have to scratch Ludlum from my list"
2,Ludlum Lite,"Lite as in co-billing and lesser quality, not fewer pages. A pretty standard Ludlum international global conspiracy of evil plot, without any memorable characteristics. Read it if you're bored, I guess, but this is really the pop fiction equivalent of an insipid t.v. sit-com."
5,The start of what could be an exciting series,"In the prolog three seemingly unrelated people dye of a uniquely fast acting virus. Prepare for gushing blood and more.Our hero, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jonathan (""Jon"") Smith M.D. from USAMRIID, is warned by an old friend to be ware of the Ides of March. Oops I meat that the friend xxx warns him that he is in trouble. Evidently the warning is too little too late to save the love of his life. He spends the rest of the story with the help of some extraordinary friends, tracking down the culprits.All the characters are bigger than life. They can go anywhere and do anything whit out the annoying details that would make the story impossible. Of course Robert Ludlum is a tad over descriptive and fluffs a 100 page tale into a 400 page tale mostly with gushy stuff (I suspect the influence of Gayle Lynds). The very thing that makes this story surreal is the very thing that makes this story fun. I am looking forward to the next book in the ""Covert-One"" series."
4,The Hades Factor,"I am a Ludlum fan (read them all) who loves a good story...not one of those fans who thinks they are a book critic and nitpicks every phrase or fact. If you like a good suspense/espionage story with solid characters that is hard to put down then you will enjoy this book. Lt. Col Robert Smith, MD. is a strong lead character and Marty Zellerbach is an extremely interesting supporting character. Watching Marty battle his Asperger's Syndrome (type of autism) really adds an interesting wrinkle to the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read a good story that is hard to put down..I read it in three days! I look forward to the second book in the series and to reading co-author Gayle Lynds other works."
3,huge,"way too big to get into a mat, thus severe limitations in use. Pictures should show scale of this item"
2,One major flaw...,"This is okay, though as another reviewer said, too big to be very portable. The pegs work fine for us, no trouble so far.The big negative, for me, is the fact that it's all one piece. If the two players' boards snapped apart, you could use it in a car. As it is, you have to sit facing each other, and it's just small enough that you need to do it on the floor, or on a very small table.Oh well - I got it because it was on sale, and we didn't have a regular battleship set. If my kids like it enough, I'll get them a better version - one with separate boards for each player (good in general, not only in the car).Fun - battleship is a fun game; the awkwardness of this set takes away little.Educational - there is some learning of how to...""spread your fire"". One son took all of his shots in a single line at first, for example...not the most efficient.Durable - don't know yet.Overall - size and setup kill it - too big for a portable, too small for a ""regular""."
2,Too Big to be travel size,"Travel size should mean smaller to fit into travel bags. These folio games are huge! They are only a little smaller than the game in the original box - which for me, defeated the purpose. Save your money on this one - they take up a TON of room!"
3,3 Stars with work!,First thing you need to do is sand down the pegs that hold the ships to the board. Nearly all! My son had cracked his board twice before I saw what was happening. The pegs that mark shots taken are fine. He likes it.
4,Color displays of weather and bridge,"In 1997 photographer Richard Misrach began photographing San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge at all hours of day and night, creating a year-round workbook of seasonal bridge views: GODEN GATE is his catalog which packs in over eighty images culled from a series of over seven hundred shots. Full-page color displays provide a wealth of mostly-distant bridge images set against changing skylines and backgrounds. Weather plays a large part in these captivating images - but so does history, and art historian T.J. Clark adds an essay which provides background information on Misrach's interests and approaches, with geographer Richard Walker adding commentary on geography and viewpoint. The result is an artistic catalog with appeal not only to any California resident but to any interested in Bridges or architectural art."
1,Pay for an advertisement-NOT,"These picks have the ""Musician's Friend"" logo on them which is not specified. It looks like it was pasted on the picture on the webpage, but it's actually on the picks like that . . and they are all exactly the same color, no variation. You think if someone wanted to sell an advertisement for their own business they would at least make it look a bit more nice. For this reason I will not be purchasing any more items from ""Musician's Friend""!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"Yes it is a humor book not self help. I cried out loud and laughed to tears. At the time I read this my daughter was a pre teen. If you have at least a pre teen daughter, this book is a must read."
5,dust collector,"My Husband loves his new dust collector. We thought it would be loud and it is really very quiet, my vacumme is lounder. Does a wonderful job in his work shop and hooks up to all his tools just wonderfully"
2,240 operation,"I haven't had the dust collector long enough to comment on its performance. But, its listed as 120/240 VAC, to run on 240 you need to purchase a different switch from Delta($30). After a discussion with Delta customer service, I was informed this was an option not a standard part, even though its advertised as a 240 machine. So for me, this item is not as advertised, and customer support is poor."
1,A vacuum cleaner from a $.99 store would have been better,Have been running this since November. The arm that holds the bag up snapped off from a cheap chassis and bad weld job after 3 weeks. My welder explained he has re welded 3 of these now because they all do the same thing. I might start using it to collect ping pong balls off the floor but have doubts it can handle it...
3,Vaccuum system,While the machine is well constructed it fails to do what it was meant to do. That is to vaccuum. My Craftsman shop vac has way more suction than the Delta.
4,A improved machine,"A good dust collector, has some improvements over older units. Only thing it needs is A on / off switch that can be wired for 220V power. Had to buy one, looks identical to the 120V one that came with the dust collector."
4,Good Value,"For the price this Delta dust collector seems to be a good value. I like the fact that the bag filters down to 1 micron of dust. Even though the cart it is mounted on, is on casters, I am using it as a non-movable dust collector. If possible I will post a video of how I have it connected up to some of my equipment."
5,Great product,"Great dust collector, has good suction, installed a seperator in front of it combined with the 1 micron bag there is a noticeable reduction in the amount of dust in my workshop."
3,Delta 50-760,"Good unit ,all in all, for the price...Farly quiet..good suction..could use somthing else in place of the cheesy platic bag for the sawdust collection.."
3,lives ruined by literature,"I read this book for my course in ""Lives Ruined By Literature"", and indeed, they were. This book is certainly a classic, and it certainly reveals the Romantic mindset, but it is DEPRESSING! If you're the type to turn off the radio or television when a murder news story comes on, don't read this book."
4,Excellent,"Except for the fact that a scanned text document output in PDF takesa very large space, everything else was fine, and Iam very happy with mypurchase"
2,1yr in & Looking to Replace it.,"I have had my MP600 about a year. Although I've had my 3rd MP600 far less than a year. Out of the box, it didn't work and was replaced by Canon. It's replacement worked for 2 months and it had to be replaced by Canon. Now the 3ed one keeps telling me the output tray is jammed. Seems like a bad sensor cuz there's nothing there. I'll call Canon again, but why? Great features don't mean much to me when it doesn't work."
1,Canon Pixma MP600 Printer Fiasco,I purchased the Canon MP600 printer on 7/25/07. I printed one test page to see if it worked. Everything worked fine. Anything else I tried to print after the first page caused the paper to bind in the machine. I have spent close to four hours trying to return this machine and neither the manufacturer or the vendor want to help me out on this. I would not recommend this printer to anyone based on my experience with this product.
1,Stay away,"There's several things to complain about, but there's one single thing that makes this a complete and total disappointment for me. I bought an MP600 a year ago, and I'm now throwing it away, out of pure spite. Why such an immature reaction?Because: The SCANNER will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels. Yup. Even if I don't want to ever print color, the scanner won't work unless I keep the Magenta at a defined level.Thanks for 12 months of sluggish performance, and goodbye."
1,LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!,"THIS WAS A GREAT MACHINE FOR A WHILE. WHEN recognizing the ink cartridges DOESN'T WORK (U150 ERROR) WHEN THE INKS ARE STILL FULL! YOU CAN'T SCAN, YOU CAN'T PRINT, YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING! NOW I CAN'T EVEN PRINT BLK AND WHITE PAGES....................>_<"
4,Very Satisfied,"I've had this AIO printer for two or three weeks now. I am very impressed with Canon and especially the MP600 All-in-one photo printer. It replaces an older HP882C Desk Jet and an Epson 1370 scanner. It was very easy to setup. It took about an hour. Photos are exceptionally sharp. It is so much faster than my old HP and the overall quality of photos and printed material is much improved. I like having two paper sources; the cassette and the sheet feeder so you can keep two kinds of paper loaded all of the time. The control panel is simple; not a lot of buttons making it easy to use. Scanning is very easy and produces excellent, if not better, results than the original documents. For the money, there is a lot of value in this machine. Unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to use all of its features. It also has a fairly big footprint on my computer table."
1,The worst printer i've ever had,"This is probably the worst printer I've owned. It is, huge, even bigger than many other multifunction printers. The cords are designed so they are in a difficult place to put in and take out. But more importantly, it has broken twice and after a while it isn't worthwhile to fix it.I only recommend this printer if you have a huge desk and if you can face the printer backwards to see the cords."
4,Excellent Printer,"One of the best printers in the market. I was looking for an all in one for quite sometime and this one struck-me with its printing quality. The Photo prints are really sharp and crisp but at times the photo-prints tend to be a bit on the darker side. This can be avoided by touching the photographs a bit before printing, a pain!!! nevertheless. It comes with a HD panel to preview the tasks it will perform. Copying, document printing, scanning and photo-printing etc are all cool features.This printer though, is an ink-guzzler. You print 50-60 photos and it will yearn for a new print-cartridge. And cannon provides the propriety ink-cartridges that are priced too high for comfort. I just hope that they bring the price of the cartridges down a bit. All in all, a wonderful product with all the features you will desire, just watch-out for the Ink cartridges, they call for your attention very often."
2,not crazy about it,"I had a Pixma IP4200 printer that worked just fine. Then my husband decided that we had to have a scanner. Instead of buying a separate scanner, I decided to look at the all-in-one printers. I purchased the MP600 because it got such great reviews. There are things I like about this all-in-one printer. It certainly is more compact than separate units and the scroll wheel is a very nice feature. The printer itself is comparable to my IP4200. It produces very good quality prints. The scanner and copier functions are an entirely differnt story. The color reproduction is horrible. I realize that I may need to play with the settings for the scanner but I don't understand why the color is so off in copy mode. I'm seriously considering returning this product, reinstalling my IP4200 and buying a separate scanner."
1,No Power issue solved,"Put one star originally because of the following problem, however, now that it's fixed I wanted to change it to 4 stars but it won't let me. When I originally bought this printer, I thought it did an amazing job with both pictures and documents. Unfortunately, after only 6 months of sporatic use, it just stopped working. It wouldn't turn on. I tried plugging and unplugging it from both the wall and from the printer itself. I tried different outlets too. It just wouldn't power on any more. I was very disappointed because I loved this printer when it was working.I called tech support and they told me to completely unplug it for 20 minutes. I thought this was stupid since I had plugged and unplugged this multiple times since it had broken. However, I did as he said and unplugged it for 20 minutes. Sure enough. When I plugged it back in, it started working just like it had before."
3,Big trouble with Vista installation,"Even though this product has the Vista certified logo on the outside of the box, my new Vista Home Premium system would not accept the installation from the enclosed CD. Product did install flawlessly on my old Windows XP system. I spent 3 days trying to get it to install to Vista. Vista installation instructions were ambiguous and conflicting. Tried the Canon website Vista driver download, that also would not work. Canon has no realtime online chat help. I did get a response after 1 day by email, but you can guess how much help that was. I eventually got the Vista system to recognize the product but it required some 25 different installation attempts with variations. The product performance now is good. Good luck with Vista Home Premium installation."
3,not as awesome as it looks,"print quality is good, but not as good as I had hoped. paper feed wore out quickly and had to exchange twice- three printers & still not happy."
4,Nice full featured printer/scanner,Not the speediest kid on the block but that may be due to the ten foot USB cable. Lots of great features and nice print quality.
2,Can't print on stock heavier than 28 #,"Just finished setting up my new MP600CANON PIXMA MP600 Multifunction Inkjet Printer/Copier/Scannerand after printing about 10 reasonably high quality sheets for which I was quite satisfied, I finished reading the manual to tackle other projects and found that paper heavier than 28# cannot be used. Since I print my own greeting cards and photo greeting card stock is 81# and cover stock is 67# the printer is unacceptably limited for my applications. So I have to return it."
3,Historical reconstruction of a fascinating story,"This is local history for me, although not my relations. Mr. Rosholt, the author, was from Rosholt, WI. The 3 stars are for the clumsiness of the writing. The rest, however! This is the story of the abduction of a settler family's child, who, in turn, re-abducts the child from the Indians when relocated. Except that it is the wrong child! Mr. Rosholt may not be Kenneth Roberts, but his attention to the historical record is astounding. Using land records and the court records surrounding the case, he brings together the cast in a reconstruction of the events surrounding the abduction and its tragic results, while keeping the reader informed of the historical sweep of events - the founding of towns, the spread of the settlers in Wisconsin to government lands, constant relocation of the Menominee Indian tribe. Every detail is attended."
3,GPS and Land Navigation,"Being new to hand held GPS techniques, I purchased The GPS & Land Navigation DVD, hoping to acquire detail information about GPS techniques. I was very disappointed. This product only tells part of the story. Most subjects are casually mentioned, NOT a lot of detail, the one exception, however, is the UTM system. With a bit more effort, this could have been a great DVD. Each topic presented appears to be rushed.One reviewer complained about the author using the Garmin Etrex Vista for illustration. That's not a valid complaint. To illustrate a concept, a typical product is used [by books, DVDs, etc] and this is certainly a popular handheld GPS.This DVD will give you an over view of GPS navigation. You will want to acquire additional sources for complete detail information. A book I found helpful is ""Outdoor Navigation with GPS"" by Stephen W. Hinch."
4,Escaped,"Has the hit Open Arms and this release pretty much defines their style from here on. Stadium rock with big production power ballads. I agree with other reviewers that it hasn't aged well and I don't agree with the reviewer who gave this CD 5 stars just because it is the best Journey album. In its time, this group was more successful and better than average but they are not in the upper echelon."
2,SACD Stereo -- NOT 5.1,"If you have a SACD Player it's probably an analog 5.1 Multichannel. This is a SACD and will only play on a SACD player, but it's stereo only. What good is that!!! The standard CD sounds much better when you play it in a digital 5.1 or 7.1 stereo mode. With this stereo SACD, you are forced to listen to it in 2 channel stereo. YUCK, what a disappointment!! I didn't even know that they offered SACDs in stereo."
4,Dizzee Dun Gud,"Dizzee is tha man! U gotta check this album, if u dnt try it out then u is a fooool. Showtime as got evrfin frm mind playin n word twistin lyrics too finely produced and unique beats. This guy shows wat its really like on tha streets ov london and even tho im a manchesta boy am still feelin wat dizzee's got2say. He talks about evryfin a kid like me can relate too, girls, smokin too much whizzy and makin doh. Goin 2 c him at manchesta academy nex month, guna bee heavvyy lookin 4ward 2 hearin tha bes tracks...*Respect Me,*Stand up Tall,*Dream and *Imagine. Buy Dis Album MuvaFu**A!!"
3,Flute Review,Bought for my granddaughter based on her recommendation. However she discovered that she has to play the music at an octave higher than what is in the book. So check first before buying to make sure the songs can be played as printed in this book. Great Disney songs and works great for me on the piano. I recommend it for Disney musicians.
2,anatolian knitting,"Both instructions and charts are not very readable. I would keep it, but it is not worth $36, maybe $5."
2,Arts And Crafts Time!,"Although well put together, this book is very much on an elementary school level. It would be great for teachers but not if you are interested in designing, making, and performing professional level puppets. Cute little book, but NOT 'The World's Most Incredible Puppet Making Book Ever'."
5,great filter medium,"This arrived several days early. Is packed very densely. I ordered this to be used in my aquaclear 50 on my 29 gallon community, and planned to use it for mechanical filtration instead of that sponge that comes with it, but it turned out the AC50 has WAY too low GPH for even a 29 gallon so I returned it and plan to get an AC70 which is big enough for my tank. (you really have to pay attention to the GPH on aquaclears, for such a good filter they have GPH ratings much lower then the tank size they're intended for) Since by the time this floss arrived the AC50 had all ready been returned, I didn't get a chance to test it, but I plan to update this review when I get the AC70 in a few weeks."
1,Avatar by Kohler a mediocre choice,"The Kohler Avatar faucet looks good, but doesn't live up to its promised performance or the price we paid for it. We needed a spray head replacement kit within the first 18 months, and after another 2 years (of light use, mind you), it needed more replacement parts for the stem controls which govern the workings of the internal water flow column. This latest fault caused constant leaking down the stem all over the granite countertop behind the sink (and of course, it also leaked all over below the sink, too). I will never buy another Kohler product. For the nearly $400 we paid for this unit, I would have expected 20 years of flawless function aside from an occasional change of a spray head gasket or filter screen. Kohler FAIL."
5,One of the best TMNT games ever,"Really Great Graphics , straight foward gameplay , cute characters , fun setup and story , and a almost cartoon like look too it. Ninja Turtles is simply and fun enough for us old schoolers and modern enough for today's gamers. The controls are fairly easy and simple enough like any Ninja Turtles game , to allow anyone to have hrs. of fun. Jungle's , sewer's , running and jumping over the top of New York City . . . So Many different & creative level's make this a fun must have for your entire family and a Jem for your Playstation.Warning: This Game might be addictive."
2,Steve Perry album with Schon and Cain as reluctant guests,"Journey was one of my favorite bands in the early 80s, and I eagerly anticipated this album after loving Captured, Escape and Frontiers. What a huge disappointment. Why would a band 'Raised On Radio' make elevator music? This is lite pop except for a few good songs (""Girl Can't Help It"" and one or two others). It seems that the rest of the band was as disgusted with Steve Perry's new direction as were fans. The band dissolved through the making of this record."
5,ROR Needs More Respect!,"This and Trial By Fire are by far my favorite Journey albums. There isn't a single song on this one I can't listen to every day, and I do! You feel something with every song. The title song is one of the most fun pieces I've ever heard, the use of old song titles is just pure joy. You cannot sit and have to sing along. And the last song, Why Can't This Night Go On Forever is one of Journeys most beautiful. The combination of Neals killer guitar and Perry's soul touching voice is in force from start to finish. This effort is as fine as any Journey has ever produced, it's sad that we will never hear such magic again."
1,Here I go again bashing Journey,Be good to yourself is probobly the gayest song these sell outs have ever done. It's really hard to say which Journey album is the worst but if you say this one I won't argue with you.
4,A more romantic Journey,"Very much one of Journey's underrated albums. The songs here have more of a romantic touch to them. Steve Perry's vocals once again are terrific, Neal Schon's guitars are always a delight to listen to and Jonathon Cain's textured keyboard work really shines on this album.The vocal harmonies are really emphasized and new touches as a saxaphone are featured on the songs.The title track is clever play on words using song titles from classic songs of the 50's and 60's recalling the glory days of radio. Girl Can't Help It, Positive Touch, Once You Love Somebody, Happy To Give and I'll Be Alright Without You are among the best songs on the album."
2,"Oh, argh.","I'm a big, fat Enigma fan. Yes, yes I am. And not even this fuming heap of an album will change my mind.I like the recurring O Fortuna theme. It's cathedralic in classic fashion: good. Lovely. But where the *heck* did the cheesy affirmations in the second track come from? ""Don't accept average habits""? Couldn't they have said it in French, at least? It's positively embarassing to listen to, even with no-one else in the room. And that embarassment lingers with one throughout the rest of the obviously lackluster album, making it difficult to relax into the trademark Enigma meditative state.Yes, I'll buy the next album. I've got them all, why break the chain? Why let this unfortunate rotten dumpling in the rich multicultural stew that is Enigma spoil my entire opinion? I won't hold it against them, and neither should you. Nail the pretty CD picture--in the case, with CD included--to your wall. And wait it out."
5,powerful secrets,"It is very interesting to discover the prevalent Carmina Burana thread to this work - despite no mention of this on the sleeve. Obviously a bold and potentially disastrous move - interweaving one's own work through this monumental thread - is pulled off with aplomb by Michael Cretu, aka Enigma. These songs are mysterious, deeply moving and varied. Overall, this guy is still at the bleeding edge of trance/pop/new age mélange and his keen vision justifies the usurping of one of the most amazing pieces of classical music ever heard. He took a risk and made it work."
1,Definately not Enya,"Anyone who would say Enigma is comparable to Enya probably wants to sell CD's more than listen to the music. But that was the pitch. You got me this time, and it looks like it was a successful promotion. When people discover though that the orchestration, rhythms, voices and overall tone is nothing like Enya, you may have fewer takers next time. You can sure you've lost me."
4,Love It!,"While at first this latest work from Enigma wasn't exactly what I was expecting, I am nevertheless excited about this newest release. I love the way the entire set of Enigma works ties together. And, as is always the case, each time I listen to this CD I hear something new. Great work. If I had any wishes for the next Enigma CD, it would only be that I'd like to hear fewer vocals by Michael. Don't get me wrong, the vocals are meaningful, but I enjoy the songs without Michael's vocals much more, probably because they allow the mind and spirt to wander without the guidance of a lead vocal. Thanks for the great work!"
2,Sounds too much like Enigma 3,"ENIGMA 3 + O FORTUNA + CRETU SHOUTING + NASTY GUITARS = SCREEN BEHIND THE MIRROR. As simple as that.I can't deny that from a more technical point-of-view we could say this is the best Michael Cretu production to date, but it sounds just like Enigma 3! While listening to it I thought: ""Hey! This song is a faster, remixed 'Why!'"", or ""Isn't that from the last track of the first album?"", or ""Somebody tell him to stop shouting!"". Most elements and instruments used in the songs sound as if they were RECYCLED from his earlier work. Also, there are too many ""O Fortuna"" adaptations and remixes out there to listen to random samples across an entire album. There is no strong ""hit"" song either, or at least as engaging as ""Return to Innocence"", ""Carly's Song"", ""Why!"", ""Mea Culpa"" or ""Sadeness"". If you want more Enigma 3, buy this album. If you'd like evolution in Cretu's work, look elsewhere because in this album there is none."
3,A mixed bag at best.,"I fear that this album seems to veer somewhere between each of the previous Enigma albums, with the end result sounding mixed at best. The fact that previous albums are sampled doesn't help this much. ""Push the Limits"" (Le Roi style) starts the album off quite well, and I thought for a moment that perhaps this album could pull the sort of grand vision I liked so much from Le Roi. But then we get ""Smell of Desire"" (MCMXC, almost literally), then ""Modern Crusaders"" (Cross), and everything's off track... The album continues to stylistically wander around for the rest of the music, unfortunately. It's not bad but it doesn't shine.So, my recommendations: if you like one particular Enigma album and dislike the others, this album isn't for you. If you like Enigma in general, I'd give it lukewarm support. If you just want spiffy background music, this might just do, but I'd prefer Deep Forest myself...or Le Roi."
4,Enigma,"I purchased a lot of Enigma's songs and still have them. Some I didn't purchase were too hard to understand the purpose, but for the most part they are awesome just because they are different and experimental in their messages they try to release in their songs."
3,"A must have for true ""Enigmatics""","I had to have this CD, being a die hard fan of Enigma, but I must say it does not deliver where the last albums have. E1 was a masterpiece, E2 and E3 were beautiful soundscapes, but E4 is missing something. You can easily hear the techno influence here, but I wish Cretu would stay behind the console and away from the mic. The oversampling of O Fortuna was also dissapointing. Gravity of Love has to be the standout track, a stunning blend of vocals, synth and drums, but still reminicent of Return to Innocence from E2. A bit overproduced, but still a must have for true ""Enigmatics""."
2,Fourth and Declining,The latest Enigma album is perhaps the largest dissapointment. Cretu's talents seemed to have been somewhat strained with this album. As always he add's his voals to some tracks. His voice while okay on the first album has gotten steaily worse. Becoming both grating and often incomprehensible. The lyrics have become almost mundane in there effort to be amibigious. It is still listenable but I do not suggest playing it along side the previous albums
5,This CD left me numbed by emotion!,"I didn't really know what to expect from this cd since I had no previous Enigma cds, but after listening to it all the way through I was taken back. Each song brings about a different emotion that get under the skin leaving you wanting more. The sensual and breathtaking voice of Olive creates a mood like no other. With the combination of world-music influence along with the unique beat patterns, I was left saying ""Why didn't I hear about them before?!"" This cd has a bit of trance, trip-hop, and New Age comfortably molded together creating a sound that will tweak your senses. I love it!! This is definitely one of my favorite cds."
2,"RUTH-ANN FROM ""OLIVE"" ONLY GOOD THING HERE....","Damn you, Curly, don't you know that Orff has been sampled now FAR TOO MANY times for you to come along and do it and expect to be considered original? I find it VERY difficult to get by Enigma's over use of the Carl Orff samples... they distract from a very good piece of work, and from an otherwise SPECTACULAR song, ""Gravity of Love"". I have been a fan of Enigma AND Olive since both of their respective debuts, and Ruth-Ann's vocals are as strong and passionate as ever, here. If any DJ or music producer reads this, give ""gravity..."" a remix WITHOUT the ""Carmina Burana"" samples... ;) After a bit of a disappointment after E3, I am underwhelmed over all with this outing. Buy Olive, ""Extra Virgin"" if you havent already... IT'S WORTH IT. It should be the litmus test for all other music in this genre."
1,The Screen behind the Mirror,"Nothing new.If you have their greatest hits album and want more dont bother with older albums,because you already have them."
3,Most focus is on lower body,"I bought this because I am VERY right handed and have an obvious muscle imbalance of the arms, shoulders, upper back. Unfortunately in the screening, it's all for lower body and core. Does have some good stuff for those areas but forgets the upper half."
5,Must Have!,"Everybody should buy this book and read it, even if you are not an athlete. The self movement screen should be done by everyone. In just a couple of weeks of doing the progression exercises, pain is leaving my body. If you are a trainer you must have this book.Reviewed by [...]."
1,Terrible,"Awful space rock. Chord progressions very tired and predictable. ""A Design for Life"" is the only song here I can tolerate."
5,"Brilliant, evocative and simply surprising.","The Manic Street Preachers are one of the world's best and sadly unknown bands. Finding an album of theirs in America is nearly impossible, but if you can, I highly recommend Everything Must Go. Bradfield's Mercury/Daltrey voice soars bringing the listener to emotional heights. It's difficult to write simple, yet complex addictive melodies, but the Manics nailed it every time. A brilliant, evocative ballad such as A Design For Life needs to be heard by everyone with a heart. I wish I could give it more stars, it deserves it."
2,Stop while you're ahead,"This book totally [was bad]. The series was good, but it just keeps going downhill. I think Francine Pascal should have stopped while she was ahead. The series was good, and she could have ended it after Loki died. Without him, there really isn't a story plot. I don't want to hear about all these stupid high school problems. If I did, I would have bought a Sweet Valley High book (also written by her). I guess if you read the series, you might want to read this, just to see how it goes. I'll read until the end for curiousity. And the fact that it can't get worse."
3,zzzzzzzz....,"This book is very very very usefull... as a paperweight. Don't get me wrong, some content was very helpful but this book is definetly not for beginners. its too lengthy and I wished it showed more step by step examples!"
2,THIS BOOK IS OUT OF DATE,This handbook is updated every 2 years. This edition is completely out of date. Don't waste your $!!!!
2,Covers no new ground...,Goes into great detail about guns and equipment but doesn't give any history or real story behind these things like 3025 did or most of the other equpment books do. Reads more like a D&D weapon book than a good and informitive Battletech source. This is another example of late era FASA junk. It would have been great if they had written it in the mid '80s.
2,Nothing special,"Don't know what the other reviewers read, but I do feel misled. I appreciated that the hero didn't hide his motivation from the heroine, but the pacing was painful. It's just too slow to gain any momentum. The characters are solid and the plot is ok, but it's not a stellar read. It's just ok. I don't think this is representative of the author's other works."
5,Perfect for graphic novel (and anime!) fans - but watch out!,"Before I begin... I've read all ? books (U'll see!) and own all ? books in the original Asian format. NEways, I've read the English version and the translation is pretty good -- not to mention the characters and story plot. Oh yeah...and I love Tasuki! *winks* But though the story is pretty tame so far, it gets pretty ""wild"" later on. I won't spoil the plot, but here's a fair warning: This series was intended for the more mature audiences. If I had to rate it the ""American"" way, it would be at MINIMUM, PG-13. If a person is impressionable, I would up it a notch. The anime should definitely be rated higher at the NR. Fushigi Yuugi is a wonderful story and Watase Yuu can really draw, but the story is definitely not an everyday fairy tale for children. Parents: DO NOT buy this for young and impressionable children!"
4,Listener Appreciated,"I was very impressed by the mix of songs on ""Listener Supported."" The only thing I could ask for would be more of the tracks from R2T like ""I'll Back You Up"" or ""One Sweet World"". But LS, the 2nd live release from the entire band contains many of DMB's best live songs including ""Jimi Thing"" and""Two Step."" It was also nice to hear some of the songs formally only available on bootleg like Boyd's ""True Reflections"" or the sample of ""#40."" The highlight of this box set has to be the incredible rendition of ""Long Black Veil"" which is beautifully assisted by the 'lovely ladies'. Not bad.. not bad at all."
1,"Unoriginal, repeating piece of......","If you think my title of this review is undeserved, try browsing through the setlists of DMB. You will find very little variety and several songs that are repeated in the same position several shows in a row. Hmmmm, will Watchtower be the second set closer or the encore?Put down this Pop Music and try listening to a band worthy of the title Jam Band. Try moe., Widespread Panic, Leftover Salmon, or Galactic. If that doesn't sound good to you, go ahead and listen to Phish. But if you're a fan of Lame Mathews Band, you probably already have all the Phish music anyway...."
1,Give me a break,"For the past 5 years my nephew has said this band is awesome. I broke down and listened to it, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. I can't give this cd a better review."
3,"OK, Better Stuff Is Out There","The latest release from the Dave Matthews Band, ""Listener Supported"", is not a great release. Don't get me wrong- there are some songs that were done very well here, like #41, Rapunzel, and Jimi Thing. But this CD leaves out the great tunes- Ants Marching, Recently, What Would You Say, Tripping Billies, Satellite, Dancing Nancies, and Crush, just to name a few. A great release would've been the 5/30/98 show, which gives a quality performance with a great setlist. Oh well, still a great job by DMB. ROCK ON!"
3,Not as energetic as Red Rocks,"This is a really good album, but it is slower than the quintet usually is. I really noticed the speed on Rapunzel. The song is incredibly fast on Before these Crowded Streets. I've been trying to learn to play bass on that song for a little while now, so I know. It's so much slower on Listener Supported. Live @ Red Rocks was incredibly energetic. It had a lot of power. Especially good on that CD was the Watchtower redition. I rank that above Recently and Listener Supported's Watchtower versions. I do like the CD a lot, but I'm really just waiting for the new studio album in 2000."
3,"Looking for some great live DMB, keep looking!","If you are looking for some live DMB purchase Live at Red Rocks or Luther College. Listener Supported lacks energy and can't come close to the emotional rollercoaster that his previous live albums take the listener on. Plus there are many weak songs that detract from the lineup (#36, Long Black Veil, #40) and an experiment gone wrong (True Reflections) in allowing Boyd Tinsley to sing. Tim Reynolds guitar energy is needed here as opposed to a keyboardist replacement Butch Taylor. I do not recommend this CD unless you are a HARDCORE fan and can't live without every DMB CD."
3,"A solid performance, but...","I was there that night in north Jersey (6 years ago today!), and while DMB delivered a typically good performance, even then I could tell it was not one of their best. Because it was planned in advance that this particular concert was going to be recorded and released for a PBS broadcast, it seems that the band took a while to warm up with all of the cameras flying around. The opening jam wasn't memorable, ""PNP/Rapunzel"" was stiff, ""#41"" never took off like it usually does. But they eventually got into it around ""Jimi Thing"" and the rest of the show was stellar. ""Red Rocks"" remains the definitive (official) live recording, but this album is certainly a worthy purchase for DMB fans."
2,Same ol' Same ol',"I'm a huge dmb fan, but I dont think this cd was worth it. He's already put out two live cd's that contained mostly previoiusly released songs. Red Rocks was fine because it was the first one, and Luther College was ok because it was accoustic, and with tim, but another live one--- its getting a little redundant. The music itself isnt bad, but i dont see the point to paying for the same stuff. I'm looking forward to the next cd though."
5,Great Concert a must get!,"Hello all...I have to admit...I never really ever got into the dave matthews band, but now I am addicted...They are so amazing...You have to get this for yourself, for your friend for everyone...its so good..."
2,STICK TO THE STUDIO ALBUMS!,"I think it is time that someone dismiss the theory that the DMBAND is better live than in the studio. This is simply ludicrous. Too often in concert, Dave's voice cracks or does something totally annoying that is easily covered up in the studio. Plus, at times, the band tends to add to parts of songs attempting to make it sound fuller, when in essence it makes it sound cluttered and noisy. Compare the versions of ""Don't Drink The Water,"" ""Two Step"" & ""Jimi Thing"" to their originals. It is no comparison. My suggestion would be to stick to their 3 studio albums, all of which are incredible."
2,It's Just........Blah,"If you're a true Dave Matthews fan, than you DO NOT NEED THIS CD. Having been at the PBS concert in NJ that this CD is taken from (it was mostly teeny boppers there, not true fans) , I was skeptical when I heard that yet another live CD was being made from it, and upon listening to it, I was dissappointed, as expected. If you're looking for quintessential live DMB , you're much better sticking with Live at Red Rocks, or better yet, a taped show. Don't get me wrong, Dave is still one of my favorite artists, but the live CD thing is getting old, although I respect the difficulties and strain of touring for more than a year straight. Bottom line, I was so dissappointed with this CD after listening through it once that I gave it away. Maybe its okay for the occasional listener, but long time Dave fans won't find anything new here."
2,every girl round here got built in dave radar,"this is not one of dmb's must buys. it lacks energy, and dave doesn't put on a very good vocal performance. many songs on this have been on three or four other albums, and many others just seem to gone on without purpose. ""two step"" is my fave dave song, and it really wanders off to nowheresville on LISTENER SUPPORTED. ""crash into me"" is very dissapointing, and so is ""#41"". all in all, a descent album, but not up to the standards of other dave greats such as LIVE AT LUTHER COLLEGE."
2,Loved the original Anne of GG and Anne of Avonlea (the sequel) but skip the rest - horrible,"The classics written by L. Montgomery are wonderful and at that time the director, Kevin Sullivan seemed to understand the characters and it translated in the films BUT I GIVE HIM A HUGE 'F' FOR THE FOLLOW ON MOVIES/SCRIPTS THAT HE WROTE. The choices he has Anne and Gilbert make are COMPLETELY out of character for them...I mean come on, they wanted to both be in Avonlea and he had them sell the house, let it go to a pigsty with trashy tenants, and they moved to NY where they did nothing even remotely similar to their character's foundation and beliefs. Just horrible. Don't buy this full set, but the first two by L. Montgomery only. So disappointing."
5,"Anne of Green Gables, Complete Set","This is a great boxed set for lovers of the Anne of Green Gables series. It has every one of the movies, some that I didn't even know existed until recently."
5,WOW!,"This CD has it all...upbeat and fun, powerful and emotional. You can't miss this one. After you get it, you'll have to have the two before it and you won't be disappointed with any of them. This family is truly gifted by God and their ministry through their songs is spectacular. What voices!"
1,Don't waste your time. What a rip-off !!!!!,"It is suprising how small 386-words are as well as completely useless. Never again will I waste the money through this Digtial locker concept. Great idea, but where's the beef? Extremely disappointed. Just surf the web for this topic. It costs less and there is much more information for free."
4,Settle Back and Relax.....,"I bought this CD with a lot of caution.... not really expecting much... But I was sadly mistaken! When I first heard this CD, all I wanted to do was lie back in a bubble bath and light me some candles. The CD is senusual and smooth... and some of the songs actually have the ability to impregnate you... they are just that seductive. I admit.. there a couple of songs on there that should be erased... never to be heard again... but some of them are gifts from above, meant to sooth the savage beast in all of us."
4,sublime funk from a true musical bravado,"My initial reaction to Brown Sugar was one of ecstacy as it was profoundly fresh. A departure from the mundane sampled sounds that keep you interested for a milli-second and ultimately keeps you trapped in an unemotional vaccum. This album on its first listen was not so surprising in that this is D'angelo, clearly and definitively carrying on the spirit of exemplary soul masters of decades gone by. But on my second hearing he uses their spirit and musical genius and goes beyond their defined realm to add his own dab of innervisions or introspections to give a sound that is both comfortable and disturbing,tight in approach and rich in flavour. He has been brave with his application,both lyrically and musically. I can't wait to hear it for a tenth time as I'm sure I will be surprised.Long may his creativity continue to inspire us all."
5,Classic Material for the 21st Century,"This album is tight! D'Angelo truly outdid himself on his 2nd album. This album sounds so much better than anything thats out at the moment. The tight cuts are One mo'gin,the root, send it on, Africa, spanish joint,untittled, etc. To truly appreciate and this album you must play it from beginning to end like old school music. I actually think this is better than Brown Sugar because its so different, but better! Classic Material, Nuff Said!"
5,An Excellent Sound,"D'Angelo brings to the music business something we do not see often in modern records: music. From his smooth voice to his funky, talented band of musicians, the musicality of this record is tremendous. The slow, easy melodies of Untitled (How Does It Feel) and Send It On, and the up-tempo, beat-heavy Devil's Pie form a brilliant, panoramic landscape of sound. D'Angelo's Voodoo is a welcome diversion from the monotony of modern music."
2,Repetition,"D'Angelo lost some of his music since his last recording, and this album is more about style and mood than it is about music.Many of the songs are produced the same way - with easy flowing beats backing two or three tracks of D'Angelo's vocals. That's okay for a couple songs, but it gets old."
4,Great,"I wasn't going to bye this Cd when it came. Im more of a hip hop head. What changed my mind was reading MikeDef's review. Thanks to him, I found a new favorite aritist"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"After realizing regular tampons are pretty much carcinogenic with the chemicals they contain, I decided to give these Seventh Generation tampons a try. Foolishly, I bought 4 boxes thinking they would be fine. First of all, they are wrapped in plastic, which is very, very difficult to get off. You actually have to use a scissors to try to remove the plastic, then it cuts into the tampon. Once you accomplish getting them out of the brutal wrapper, inserting them is worse. They are so uncomfortably dry, I tried dipping them in oil, just to try to get it inserted. It is very uncomfortable. Also, they tend to not go in well and leak. To make a long story short, they suck. I wish I had only purchased one box. I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to help someone else not make the same mistake. I'm still looking for an organic product with an applicator, that inserts smoothly and does not leak. By the way, I would give it less than 1 star, if I could."
5,Great product!,"Comparable to Natracare brand but much less expensive. No complaints! Very comfortable. I just wish Amazon offered them in smaller lots. What am I going to do with TWELVE boxes of tampons, all in the same size?!?"
2,Worst designed applicator,"The applicator is so hard to use, it does not slide well so I have to struggle to push it in every time I use it. It's the stupidest design ever, and I don't understand why they can't get such a basic thing right. I'll never buy this product again. I'd rather use the Natracare organic tampon that doesn't have the applicator. Stupid stupid stupid."
2,Uncomfortable,"I'd heard many times, ""If you insert it correctly, you won't even feel it,"" and many times, no matter how I inserted it, it was uncomfortable. I was hoping that things would be different with the Seventh Generation brand, as I am a fan of their other products, but I had no such luck. I could feel it stabbing me whenever I stood or sat. It's wonderful that Seventh Generation is working toward safer feminine hygiene products, but I'm much happier with my DivaCup than I ever was with any tampon."
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this for my grandson he's been wanting it for a while.It's very hard to trace a picture. I even had a hard time. Save your money!
2,Touching My Father's Soul,"I found this book hard to read because I am a Christian and the continual reference to Buddhist pratices was sometimes hard to read. Not only because it goes against everything I believe in but because some of their beliefs are a little silly to me. I do respect that they have a great deal of faith and spirituality but it was still very difficult to read. I almost felt like I was reading a book on witchcraft. Also, he was very judgemental towards America and our ""lack"" of spirituality."
5,A dynamic experience for your students,"This book is part of the GEMS workbooks. I have used several of these books in my classroom and they have never failed to provide quality knowledge or learning experiences for my students. This book provided top quality background information with several lessons. It also included everything you need to know in the way of safety and storage of dry ice for the labs. I recommend this book to any science teacher who want to engage their students in doing science, rather than just reading about science."
4,"Easy install, but adapter needed for car use","As expected, this works much better than an FM transmitting modulator. It's a piece of cake to install if you have any experience at all working under the dash, and I have very little. The problem that I have is that there was no 3mm adapter or cable for hooking it up to an iPod. It only comes with a long left-right audio cable. I had to go to radio shack to get a a 3mm adapter. Until I find a mountable female 3mm adapter, the lengthy left-right speaker cable is just hanging out discretely through one of the panels with the adapter on the end."
2,Beware of the endless repackaging of David Bowie material,"I like these pieces in context of the original releases, but end on end they become a bit annoying. Since Bowie sold the future royalties to all his music, you can expect endless repackaging as those bonds have to produce returns. I would stick to the classic masterpieces that these instrumentals are culled from, Low, Heroes and Lodger. Those albums are pure genius. The big question for me is, will David Bowie ever produce anything new that matters?"
1,k-mart techno,Prodigy just seems to get worse and worse. People don't realize this group got started doing gimmicky techno (sounding like 2 Unlimited). Now all the bozo critics treat them like some kind of hard-core techno pioneers. This is just stupid glam rock fused with hip-hop and disguised as techno. Total junk music.
1,Brainless,"""The Prodigy"" must be one of the most ironic title given to a group of musicians, as these guys' productions are totally brainless garbage. I cannot understand how anyone could consider these guys as serious electronic musicians. Inspiring millions of other trashy skateboarder themes world-wide, the music goes no further than repeated curse words and ever-nausiating *boom, boom, boom*. The only thing that distinguishes their music from all the [lower quality] punk bands out there is that these guys torture their drum machines instead of actual drums."
3,Decent,This CD has three good songs and nothing else worth listening to. Prodigy has proven their ability through certain songs so hopefully their next album will be better.
3,Good album...,"...but not nearly as brilliant as their previous one ""Music for the Jilted Generation,"" which is one of the best cds I own. ""Fat of the Land"" is above average, with great tracks such as ""Breathe"" and ""Firestarter"" but stumbles a lot over ones like ""Serial Thrilla"" and ""Narayan."" ""Jilted,"" on the other hand, was amazing techno all the way through. Skip this one and buy ""Jilted"" instead."
4,Fat of the Land,"I first heard Prodigy in Chicago last year. My buddy and I were going to see Meat Beat Manifesto and we arrivied late. We saw Prodigy. That was the loudest, heaviest, head banging music I have ever heard. My ears were ringing for daze! I loved it! I just recently bought the cd because I have not been getting enough techno in my diet. I bought several cd's and Fat of the Land is by far the deepest bass that will rock your neighborhood. Turn it up and your friends will hear you coming from miles away! I've been told that this music kills more brain cells then mushrooms but has less calories than a Guniess!"
1,Clowns,"Prodigy used to be one of the countless, faceless ""techno"" bands making 2-Unlimited-esque ""techno anthems."" Any wonder they got dropped from their previous contract? Then the world waits all that time for the group to squeeze out this sad effort. This is predictable, obnoxious big-beat throwaway stuff. For every decent song we get 2 booming tracks that sound alike or that feature ""vocals"" by Keith Flint."
2,Get The Wolverine Guide,This guide is cheaper than the Wolverine one and for good reason. There just isn't much information. I ended up having to buy the other book upon arriving.
2,Skipping Meadows? don't buy this book,"I'm not very impressed by this updated guidebook. While the new guidebook does include the Meadow river climbing areas (incredible climbing there), it's hardly an improvement over the contents of the old version. Very brief descriptions, inexact topos, but worst of all mistakes from the last version are still present in this book. On a trip to Fern Buttress my friend and I found inaccurate bolt counts as well as incorrect grades for more than one route. My suggestion is that if you have the older version, don't bother with buying this unless you plan to visit the Meadow river."
4,Lemme take you to the candy shop.,"No seriously get in, it smells great. It's like walking through a forest of cotton candy that then becomes a forest of flowers. This is a Uni-sex fragrance imo, it smells good and ins't too forceful. I gave it a 4/5 because the smell goes to skin level within 3-5 hours on my body."
4,Super sweet,"If you don't like sweet fragrances this is not for you. It smells great to me, I can see how some would think this is feminine. Just know you're going to smell like sugar all day long. Great buy."
4,A great rock cd. If there can be such a thing.,"This is a great overall cd. I was amazed at how profound the lyrics were. My favorite song was ""Wait"" I also liked ""Not An Addict"" despite the controversial lyrics. I also liked ""Old Woman"". They were all great songs. I am probably going to try to buy this cd. It Rocks!"
2,Not a lot of substance,"I loved ""First Date,"" the first book in this Bridesmaid series, but ""First Kiss"" wasn't what I thought it should be. Kiki, the main character, is an annoying, shallow snot, who may be involved in some funny situations, but I can't stand her. I'm on page 214 right now. I don't even know why I'm still reading it. I guess just to make the series complete. Kiki's supposedly fab ""Fab"" isn't fabulous either. We barely get to know him. This book just doesn't work for me. Very disappointed."
5,Remarkable non-algebraic development of the topic.,"This authoritative and profusely illustrated work is singular in it's derivation of the topic in it's native language - using geometric rather than algebraic vernacular. Not a simple-minded abridgement, but rather a deeply philosophical treatment of the subject with an extremely rare insight as to it's broader context in the natural universe."
3,Classical and metal doesnt quite mix here...,"I found it hard to get into this album. At some parts the orchestrations are great, but at others it seems to ruin the vitality of the metal parts. For instance: the sextuplet rapid picking part of One. During the guitar stutter the symphony keeps playing. For me, that ruined alot of the power that the stutter conveys. Michael Kamen is supposed to be one hell of a classical composer but he has done much better than this. Only get this if you are a die hard Metallica fan. Not because it has the orchestra."
3,A good routine except for my idotic pet peeve,"While other reviews mention the high points of this DVD (which I completely agree with), halfway through I noticed Ralphie tacking ""OK"" onto the ends of sentences, and then in the middle of sentences. I've worked with a couple of people who do this and have developed this weird compulsion to focus on it once I notice it. If this is the kind of thing you notice, be careful watching this disc!Just to make sure I was hearing as many ""OK""s as I thought, I kept count on a 2nd viewing and ended up with 227 ""OK""s in 1:46. I know this is picky, but it really is one of those things that distracts me when people are speaking (along with ""You know"" waaaay too many times per minute).With that said, I still think this is a better stand-up routine than Ralphie's earlier discs. He covers a broader range of subjects and is still funny as hell! The last 10 minutes is worth the disc alone."
1,My Father's Daughter,"This book is from a spoiled jealous child that still hasn't gotten over her fathers choice in wives. From what has been written over the years about this man, Frank Sinatra was a very private person and I'm sure that he wouldn't be very happy with this book. It seems that Barbara is the one that can hold her head up high with dignity. Tina needs to get a life, and a job. Making money off her fathers name isn't becoming."
1,Could be Good,The iTalk Pro does not work (yet) with IPod touch. Griffin is waiting for Apple to unlock the iPod touch. Write to Apple and implore them to get busy with the next system upgrade so I can start using my iTalk Pro. Thanks!
3,"Relates the ""Big Picture"" but not much detail","This book would be helpful if you need a big picture of Microsoft's product line under the .NET banner. It's brief and readable, not going into much detail under any section. In the first part, the authors cover the .NET framework but give rather skimpy coverage to ADO.NET. The second section describes the .NET Enterprise servers. Much of the material can be gathered from other sources, although the authors tie it together with some basic descriptions of e-commerce strategies, web services, and how the servers are employed. However I think the retail price is a bit high for the value added.If you want to get a broad overview of .NET and don't need descriptions of the .NET Enterprise servers, I would suggest ""Introducing .NET"" instead of this book, since it provides more detail. If you don't care about the $$ but want an easy read pulling together Microsoft's strategy and product line, this book might suffice."
2,"Disorganized and ""uncut""","I had to purchase this book for a graduate school course. There is a lot of good information here. Unfortunately lengthy examples and tangents muddy it up pretty badly. Also, I think the author(s) could have safely assumed that readers are familiar with programming; maybe that perspective could have grounded and guided the chapter flow a little better.Looking at any 1 section, the writing is good and the explanations are clear for the most part. The catch is that the book as a whole is a collection of enormous disorganized chapters; chapter 2 is almost 100 pages. This work is dire need of editing and some understanding of its intended audience."
1,Terrible book,"This book was used as the primary book for my last college class. The material is poorly laid out and very difficult to follow. Unless you are in your last year of CS or a Engineering student, do not buy this book. I even emailed one of the author's of the book to see if there was any other material available to help better understand the text, and his answer to me was, ""you can buy the Advanced book."" What a joke."
5,If you like citrus fragrances,This is a very good one. An excellent lime fragrance that is not strong or overpowering but does last quite awhile. It is not sweet or feminine but really a refreshing fragrance for a man.
1,What I was sent has to be a knock-off,"I have used (and liked) Royall Lyme for decades. This time, the product I received from Amazon had a musky smell. I wrote to customer service at Royall Lyme Bermuda to ask if they had reformulated the fragrance. They replied that the fragrance should have been the same as always and asked where I got it. When I told them ""Amazon,"" they replied that they had no reliable sellers on Amazon or EBay and that knock-offs were common on the internet. I'll never buy it through Amazon again. I was ripped off!"
1,TrulyAwful Stuff,"This stuff is terrible. It has a strange acrid, fusel smell to it that makes me feel sick when I wear it. I don't know if it's a bad batch or if they've changed the recipe but the bottle I got is bad. A great substitute is Ogallalla Bay Rum company Lime and Peppercorn. That stuff is awesome. This stuff is not."
1,very disappointing,"Royall Lyme was one of the very 1st cologne/aftershave products I ever used. The deep and rounded lime scent started strong and lingered gently but distinctively. My dad introduced me to this product; so it has many important associations. What a disappointment to find that today's version is a poor imitation of the original. Initially the scent is only vaguely citrus and quickly fades into an unidentifiable chemical trace. Even the packaging is cheap and unimpressive to anyone who remembers the original. I feel cheated. If you, too, remember the original, save your money and your good humor: buy some other product."
5,Great Lime scent!,"This is a true, wonderful smelling Lime scented cologne! It has a fresh, clean lovely scent. The packaging is wonderful!! There is all this writing on the heavy paper that wraps the cologne box and it's very entertaining to read. It reminds me of a J. Peterman ad for a product!! I recommend this cologne highly and I am a very picky cologne/perfume consumer that usually only finds a scent I like once every couple of years!!"
3,Smells like I have been swimming in key lime juice,"It smells like key lime and nothing else. No musk, no wood, no flowers, nothing but crisp lime that you smell when you scratch the thin green layer of lime skin from an actual lime. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the smell!However..... scent will last only about 30 minutes. In about an hour, pretty much no projection. One would have to stick his nose on the skin to smell the faint shadow of lime that was prevalent when sprayed.Feels like I am being cheated by accountants at Royall Lyme of Bermuda so I make my own lime cologne with Florida Water($3.95) and Key Lime Essential oil($3.95). 7 oz of lime cologne for around $9."
4,Hurricanes over Bermuda,"Like several of the recent reviewers, I noticed a difference in the last two shipments of this venerable product.I began to worry about the company after a series of devistating hurricanes hit Bermuda. I have lemon and lime bushes here on my property, and they have struggled from the storm damages.It takes years for fruit bearing trees to recover. I want to say ""be patient"", and I hope the companies have not been taken over by the banks. Some things are worth waiting for.Cheers...H"
3,Headphones Replacement Pads,These replacement pads did the job. It was the correct size for my headphones. This product arrived at a reasonable time.
2,Animorphs,"Well, the Animorphs are getting kinda boring and predictable. But think about it. Don't you want to know what's going to happen later? Don't you want to know what's going to happen in the #42th book or something? I didn't give this book too many stars because compared to the very first Animorphs book, this is a thumbs-down."
2,The Hidden?,I read it and it was not as good as the other books in the ANIMORPHS series.I think that it was quite boring.
5,Perfect,"This book arrived very FAST and for being ""used"" looked like new. I couldn't be happier with the PERFECT service."
1,Not for dog lovers,"Don't be fooled. This is NOT a book filled with heart-warming stories of dog-human relationships as the title and the cover picture suggest. In fact, this book could be very disturbing for people who consider themselves dog lovers. So disappointed and disgusted I returned it to the bookstore the next day. Don't buy it."
1,Misleading Movie Info,"When reading the release information for this movie, it is listed as being a 2012 (April 17th) release, but the movie was actually made in 1972. By looking at the image, you would think that the movie has some decent special effects (further contributing to the concept that the movie is a recent release) but it is actually a streaming release from a 16mm film.At first, it looked like a ""retro"" film, but within a few seconds, you can tell that it's actually not ""retro,"" nor ""steampunk,"" but, rather ""of the age"" of 1972.In all honesty, after the opening copyright in the credits, I stopped watching, so I can't tell you if the storyline itself is any good. Just don't buy or rent this title with the expectations that the film is a recent sci-fi/horror release."
5,A wonderful mystery for young readers.,A very entertaining story for young readers. A perfect mix of suspense and intrigue. Somewhat dated as this story was written in the 1950's but still has a contemporary tone. Can't wait to get a copy for my daughter.08.08.08 Well my daughter is now 19 and every couple years she still will curl up with this book. A very simple but timeless story.
3,I must have gotten a crappy version :(,"The movie itself is easily 5 starts hands down! I saw this when it was in the theaters and watched it dozens of times since then. The reason I only give it 3 stars is the copy I have is a horrible bluray transfer. The menu looks great when it showing the movies clips but the movie itself looks just like the plain dvd version. Plus, it's not in widescreen."
2,Not what I expected!,"I purchased this movie because the reviews say that its better than ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" but I dissagree. I rather enjoy modern werewolf movies because the special effects make it more realistic, especially when the wolf shape shift's, and attacks. If you are going to purchase one of these movies I suggest you chooseAn American Werewolf in Paris"
1,"Talk about screwin the pooch, err wolf. Should have been a serious movie.","Werewolfs are like the Terminator. They cant be bargained with, they cant be reasoned with, they feel no pity or remorse and they will hunt you down until you are dead.Well this alleged werewolf movie could have worked on the same premise. It opens with the protaganist and his friend arriving at a English Country Pub and not being warned by the townsfolk what lurks out there, just stay on the road they are told in short. Of course they dont and one friend ends up as a midnite snack. From thereon in it starts to degenerate into the poor kid who mutates into an animal that one can only describe as being part gray squirrel part wolf with a bobblehead that keeps, ehh, bobbing up and down and sideways as he walks and snaps.Ladies and Gentleman, behold the WEIRDWOLF.Not funny, not scary, not a werewolf movie by any means."
2,Classic film- disapointing tranfer,"There is no doubt that this dark comedy horror- is a genre classic. Award winning make up fx from Rick Baker and the usual fun direction from john Landis.The film works on many levels and remains as one of my favourite movies ever, still fun after many viewings- and the 'english rose' Jenny Agutter is pleasing on the eye.The one thing that lets this version down is the transfer to HD-DVDtaking into consideration the age of the film (1981 i believe- or there abouts) you'd expect grain- but with todays technology and other older transfers being incredible! This is a disapointing transfer and showed up very grainy on my 1080p tv- especially the moors sections which looked worse than my DVD version!?? (how they managed this i do not know)Great film- dissapointing transfer- if got on dvd already- save your money- you'll be let down."
4,"it'll be classic, I think","So these two american guys are walking around england, on vacation. And they come to this creepy little town out in the middle of the misty moors. And ... they don't stay the night; instead they choose to push on, despite the rain and general nastyness and their being on foot. Which, given the general attitude of the townsfolk, seems perfectly reasonable.Anyways, I'd never seen it, I'd never heard anything about it when I watched it. It's funny and gross and silly, and I love the music. (Is there a soundtrack? ""I seeeee a baa-aad moon risin'..."") I recommend it to werewolf & horror fans everywhere."
3,Pretty good horror movie,"I personally think this film is a bit overated as far a excellent tranformation scenes and humour are concerned. The Howling will always be number one when it comes to those things. Just the same, this is still a fairly enjoyable and well-made movie that is scary and worth repeated viewings."
5,Classic,"This is a book that will never be obsolete. Even though styles and trends change by season, this writer has shared wardrobe tips that will never go out of style. This book is now a coffee table accessory and I will refer to it indefinitely."
1,Don't waste your money.......,This book was so outdated and so ugly and can't believe I spent $41.00 on this god awful book......I don't recommend this book to anybody.....Boring!!!!!
2,Very Disappointing,"I must say that I was very disappointed in this game, after reading so many positive reviews. The single player game is awful, as it does not allow you to save where you want. I found myself having to repeat one mission (protect the ambassador)several times because I would die and have to start at the end of the previous mission.The online game turned out not to be the cat and mouse game that I had hoped. Players tended to congregate near stairwells (I believe the ship was the Andria Doria) and killed fairly indiscriminately."
2,Not very instructional,"I've had a number of Spanish books. My number one issue with this one is that it doesn't have enough instruction. It almost seemed as if it was an exercise book missing its partner book with the actual lessons. If you're looking for a self study book, I would not recommend this one."
3,a lot writing in book,I was dissapointed when i recieved this book and there was writing on every single page. I had to spend hours erasing it.
4,"Detailed, Lively, Discussion of Women and Medicine","This text is remarkably detailed, offering evidence from non-fiction and fiction during the period. Moreover, it is readable and lively. It is a good choice for scholars and general readers alike who are interested in the state of medicine in the nineteenth century."
3,"Adequate, but not the best on Gandhi","This is an informative, but slim read. Merton has taken some good quality material from Gandhi's thoughts, but he has missed many gems. Fischer's Essential Gandhi provides a much more comprehensive summary of Gandhi's thought. This volume has a few quotes that Fischer's works lacks, however. It is a good, slim volume, and Merton's introduction has some fine observations on Non-violence. Original sources and places where Merton found the quotes are missing, however, so the reader is left dependent on Merton's academic integrity, which one ought to think is fairly good. Overall a good work, but not exceptional."
4,could've been longer....,"...but it's a good selection of Gandhi's thoughts on the topic, and Merton's intro is wonderful."
1,False Advertising!,"Why did I give this product one star? Well, because, unfortunately, I couldn't go any lower!!! Seriously, though, I feel completely ripped off by this product.The display page says it contains the cartoon ""Easter Yeggs,"" which is what I was looking to buy. This is a collection of snippets of a few Looney Tunes Cartoons....Easter Yeggs is not even one of them! This is a blatant example of false advertising, which should be illegal. Apparently online this practice is acceptable...for shame! I hope I can prevent others from wasting their money as I did on this waste of tape."
5,A Plesant Suprise,"As the follow-up to ""Private Education"" I was very suprised when I first listened to this CD. That is by no means a bad thing at all. Night of your Life is easily one of (if not my favorite) album released this year. All the songs are good and they combine the elements of Chris' older songs with his more recently released stuff. If I had to pick a favorite song I'd go with ""Nicola 6"" because of the smile it put on my face the first time I heard it."
4,12 years later still pretty good!,"I'm just purchasing this cd now simply because I love ""I don't ever want to see you again"". All the other reviewers said everything there is to know about the cd. However, its a testament in itself that after all these years this cd still sounds great!"
2,Boy II Men ponen el liston en el cielo,"Y lo hacen con la presentacion de este album interpretado por la magnifica voz de Uncle Sam. Unas producciones que llenan desde el primer tema, con un estilo del r&b mas contemporaneo, bajando suavemente hasta el soul mas clasico. A lo largo de los 11 temas que lo componen te ves inundado de la voz de Uncle Sam. Disco imprescindible para los amantes del buen sonido, del autentico sonido Boyz II Men."
4,genuinely good,"I dont read that much any more, because a lot of books seem too cliche, or even tacky. Everything seemed like it had been done before. However, this book was actually, totally, completely genuinely excellent. Although a little slow at the beginning, the pace was soon picked up and the book flourished. It was amazing, and defenitely one of my favorites.:-)"
4,"Delightful, though surprisingly scared my 5 year old","Very cute and funny book about what happens when Nicholas switches places with his cat for the day. My kids giggled a lot, especially at all the cat-as-person and person-as-cat antics. THey also enjoyed seeing some of the cats from Kitamura's other books. The witch is a little unnecessary (I don't think the story required a reason for the switch) and frightened one of my children a little."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover.,"Although I do enjoy many of Charles Warren Eaton's landscapes, I found this book to contain alot of black and white reproductions of artwork and alot of text to fluff it up. The cover enticed me to purchase this book, a wonderful painting with vivid color and bold brushwork. But the interior color plates are not nearly as exciting, and too few in number."
5,A Stimulating Inspiration,"I count ""Intimate Landscapes"" as the most stimulating critical analysis of Tonalist Painting I have read. Clevelands' writing is both brilliant and challenging. My humanity has been improved and my understanding has been enriched as a result of reading this outstanding book. Many art books are just picture books. This one not only has the finest collection of Eatons' work in print, but you've got to read what Cleveland has to say about the art and times. He's Brilliant! Thank you!"
4,Great Game!!,"Power Grid had some new and interesting game play for me. I enjoyed the strategy required by the game a lot. Watch out for the end game, lot's of strategy there. I strongly recommend this game."
1,Don't waste your time,"Robert Ludlum has spent years writing great thrillers, and now it seems he's decided to let others write a book, he'll say he co-authored it and cash in. Good for you, Robert, but maybe you should read the book BEFORE you agree to put your name on it.This was my first experience with the co-authored book. I've seen the Tom Clancy and Nelson DeMille co-authored series too, and I've always been a little wary. My suspicions have now been confirmed. This book was a quick read, predictable as anything, and could be grasped by your average 3rd grader. Philip Shelby kept the audience in complete suspense by waiting until the 4th chapter to identify the conspirators to us. About halfway through the book you knew what the evil plan was and you knew how it was going to end.My expectations for a Robert Ludlum book have been set way too high to try and pass this garbage off as his work."
3,My first and last Covert One novel,"I have come to realize that Ludlum's name is simply being used to sell these books, I very much doubt he is actually writing them. I have been a long-time Ludlum fan and his works stands out, it is brilliant in every way and the plot is very very thought through. The Covert-One series, however, have been ""co-written"" with someone else, yeah fine, whatever, and is severely lacking in any form of believability or truth. Significantly over the top at times, seemingly in a desperate attempt to wow the reader with Ludlum's classic style of writing, but it falls way short of Ludlum's solo work."
5,bigger bags?,"I love love love these and would really like a bigger bag. 24 one ounce bags is ok, but would like to choose my own portion. They came very fast and were in perfect condition."
4,A Very Good Snack Chip,"Flavor is good, not excellent. I really like these but I have to stay accurate here with the review. They are very good but not the best. I guess there are some limits you get from staying healthy. As a health snack I'd give them 5 stars though.Secondly, they leave almost no oil residue in your mouth. So you don't have to wash them down with any strong soda to cut the film off of your tongue. And let's face it, a healthy snack is not healthy if you have to use some unhealthy drink to wash it down.All in all, these are one of my favorite healthy snacks. Very good."
3,Not like a real chip,"These had good flavor but not the texture. I thought would be like a real vegetable chip or at least be like a real potato chip..you know, crisp, etc. I really don't like the pringle like texture..if you do, you'll probably enjoy these"
1,Awesome item but can't order in Alaska,"I loved this item, and wanted to order, but wasn't a option in my area. I would really like to order Good Health Veggie Stix, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 10) but says they cannot ship to my area. I gave bad review becuase they won't ship to my area. Alaska is a state. Its not like its out of America!!"
3,carrie can be scary at nite,well this movie can either scare you or it can put u to sleep depending on your persona. i find it scary at nite but not during the day. watch it at nite and u will be scared but watch it during the day and u will find it boring. go figure...
4,A nice young upstart by 70's heartthrob John Travolta!,"An excellent horror fim, more of a suspense though. Piper Laurie is truly frightening as Carrie's religious fanatic phsychopathic mother. John Travolta has a good supporting role as the punk Billy Nolan, whose character is so believable and more of a heavy than in his small screen T.V. show ""Welcome Back Kotter"", as Vinnie Barbarino. William Katt does good as the nice boy next door Tommy Ross, who takes Carrie to the prom as a favor. Nancy Allen is good playing the troublemaking Chris Hargensen. And of course Sissy Spacek does wonderful as Carrie.A good teenage type film with a great cast! 23 years later there was a sequel which was fairly good, but nowhere as good as this one! Spacek and Laurie teamed up together again in the film ""The Grass Harp"" with former ""Gimme A Break"" T.V. star Nell Carter."
3,Not as impressed as by the sequel,"After watching the sequel, The Rage: Carrie 2, I had to watch this movie to see if it impressed me as much as the sequel did. While neither rank among the scary movies of all times, both, this movie and it's sequel, kept my eyes glued to the screen to see what happened next."
5,Carrie (1976),"Sissy Spacek is Carrie White, a teenager who is about to graduatebut is constantly teased by her class mates. The precense of a religious finatic of a mother (Piper Laurie) doesn't help her high school trama either. After strange things begin happening at school after she gets angry or upset, Carrie eventually notices she has telekinetic powers and begins using them on her enemies.Spacek is so good as Carrie and Piper Laurie is amazing as the mother. Nancy Allen and John Travolta bring out the hate we should have for them very nicely in their debut roles. The second-last scene with Carrie's mother trying to commit murder to her daughter is so eerie and the music helps put the atmosphere into it. The famous prom sequence is very cool."
4,Carrie- WOW!,"This film was great! It scared the hell out of me and i had more swear words coming out of my mouth while viewing it than i care to mention! Carrie is an amazing and complex character, one you can like, pity and hate all at the same time. Spacek is a wonderful actress too. I recommend this film to anyone, but don't expect to get a decent nights sleep after watching it...YOU WONT!"
1,Not worth it. 16th june 2004.,"Didn't really watch all the way through it, but it was soooooo boring anyways."
3,Started great but ruined at the end,"This could be a masterpiece really. From the opening and most of its running time, this movie shines with stella performance by actresses/actor. Especially two leading actress (Daughter and Mama surely) have done fantastic gobs. I consider this as a sad life story of a girl rather than horror movie. I enjoyed it but as it comes to the ending, it's ruined quickly. She harms 'everyone' so that finally she proved she was a creepy monster indeed? There were some good peoples around her at least.BTW, there were some flaws. If you put blood somewhere overnight, you will have a loaf of coagulated blood rather than 'liquid'.But overall, this movie is worth watching due to the fantastic performances. The voice of Piper Laurie is...wow!"
5,This movie is so mest up!,"This is one of the most disturbing movies ever made! It's really scary and disguisting! The best King movie is Salem's Lot, but this is right up there with it. I would recommend this to any horror fan!"
2,Is this the same story?,"I read the book, and I couldn't believe how great it was. When I saw the movie, cheesy horror scenes were added, the story was told differently, and it was hardly as moving as the book was. Obviously some cheesy horror scenes were added just to make the audience react. I guess the people who made this film didn't think the original story was as grabbing. If they stuck to the story, this movie would have rocked. I did think that Sissy Spacek did an excellent job and the cast chosen for the characters were matched perfectly."
4,A Great Movie: Sissy Rocks!,"what a great movie! The Dvd version is soooo good. The picture quality is good, considering how old it is, the dolby 5.1 is really good, compared to the mono version. i love all the extra features."
3,For an older movie...,"It's good enough to watch at least once...I had to watch the film for my psychology of adolescence class but if I had to watch again on my own, I probably would pass. However, I am interested in watching the remake."
5,carrie,This movie is a horror film yes. But it's not as scary as films now a days. This film is about a girl named Carrie White. She is picked on everyday and has no friends. Soon she figures out she has telekenetic powers. She reseaches it and learns that other people have it. Her mother sees that she has that power and is upset. Her mother thinks that everything is a sin. If you ask me the mother is the scariest thing about this movie. Then the classic prom scene. Almost everyone is dead. Carrie goes home and kills her mother and the house collapses. No more Carrie.
4,"A tad overrated, but faithful to the book","CARRIE is definately a true Stephen King classic; good acting, one of the creepiest films of the '70s, good special effects and nice gore. It is a little overrated, but not that much. It follows the novel quite accurately, and anyone who liked the novel will definately like the movie. Also, the chemistry between Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek was dead-on!"
1,carrie on bluray,very disappointed with this blu ray dvd i have a dvd copy and it surpasses this bluray transfer i wasted 15.00 on this i was really looking forward to seeing the hd picture of this favorite film of mine seller wouldnt give me my money back either so im trying to get in touch with mgm to let them know this is a bad transfer of a great film. : (
5,great item,this was a great purchase for me very satisfied. purchasing this item allowed me to save money big time service from this company outstanding received my item quickly even around this busy holiday time. definitely will continue to purchase from global sportsman
2,So / So game play,"The game mechanics are sort of hokey. By that, I mean there's really nothing to it more than marking off items on a checklist. I re-read the instructions twice to make sure that was really all there was to it. Sure, you absorb a little horse knowledge out of it, but the learning isn't really important to the strategy - more important is landing on the right squares and the horse you start out with. Think horse monopoly.While it is very well made, it was boring (sorry, but nobody in our family likes it - even our horse obsessed daughter). Get Herd Your Horses above this. It is VERY fun and what you learn from it is actually unique among horse games (wild horse habits)."
5,terrrific Beatles DVD!!,"Unlike the worthless Beatles Stories DVD, this one was terrific. i love this DVD. Never knew about George Martin's wife! She is really charming. Terrific history about the ""Fifth Beatle!"" I highly recommend this DVD. Stay away from the Beatles Stories cheapie and stick with this one!"
3,Good for timepass.,"It think it is good for time pass because the beyblade toys are much,much,much better then this."
2,Mysticism-lite,This book takes one far afield from the brilliant potentiality in mysticism and off onto some twilight. Read the real books on mystical consciousness by Happold or E. Underhill and others first. They contain incredibly transforming truth and instruction. This is mysticism-lite to such an extreme that only the lite shines-through.
1,Book uses words that I wouldn't want my son to use,"Although this is a good story for kids to read I found it hard to read to my son or for him to read it to me and having to say ""stupid"" and ""dumb"" - 2 words that are repeatedly used in this book. Instead of stupid, author could have used the word silly. I know children will eventually use these words but why make them part of their reading material???"
4,Another Dinner & Lounge Mix From A Paris Hotspot,"I buy a lot of this stuff and there are only 5 tracks of the 23 that I had before, so even though it's kind of the same old story, there's plenty of new stuff and most of it is quite good. Same concept as Claude Challe's Buddah Bar: first disk is ""Dinner"" and the second is ""Seduction"", but without the Far East/World influence. Starts out as chilled out, ambient, light trip hop and ultimately ends up in sampled, deep house. Nicely mixed but not so seemlessly you can't hear it. Would sit nicely next to Naked Music, Kevin Yost, Costes, or anything lounge or deep house (no divas). Would be a good buy both for someone new to downbeat, chilled, house as well as someone trying to get their hands on more."
5,NASTY METAL,"Down is a bad ass group of Beer drinkin,pot smokin,long haired,tatooed rednecks that make kick ass music.We got Phil Anselmo(Pantera),Kirk Weinstein(Crowbar),Pepper Keenan(Corrosion Of Conformity)Rex Brown(Pantera),and Jimmy Bower(EyeHateGod)Well theres enough sweat,booze,and reefer referance in this album to even make God himself feel nasty.This band hopefully will continue on with makin music because they kick ass.Stain Glass Cross,Ghost Along The Mississippi,The Seed,and New Orleans is a Dying Whore are all great songs to dring and smoke your ass of to.But my personal favorite is Learn From My Mistake it's a power-ballad and it just flat out kicks ass.Phil's voice sounds so clear and you can feel the regret pouring out of his soul and into the mic.Thers a great ,make that 2 great solo's by Weinstein and Keenan the cd is great if you like any of the members other bands then give Down a try."
3,PHIL ACTUALLY SINGING ON THIS ONE,"I HAD LOW EXPECTATIONS OF THIS RELEASE DUE TO THE FACT THAT PHIL CAN SING BUT RARELY DOES IT IS USUALLY JUST SCREAMING AND NOT ALL THAT GREAT, HENCE I NO LONGER LISTEN TO PANTERA ALL THAT MUCH ANYMORE! ON THIS RELEASE PHIL'S VOCALS WAIL AND THE LYRICS ARE GOOD! IT IS CRANKING STUFF AND THE GUITARS ARE VARIED AND EVEN BETTER YOU CAN HEAR REX FOR THE FIRST TIME! THE GUITAR SOLOES ARE NICE I KNEW KIRK COULD PLAY KICKING SOLOES! THE SONGS ARE MORE VARIED THAN THE 1ST DOWN W/CLEAN GUITAR PARTS HERE AND THERE. I WOULD EVEN LIKE MORE DIVERSITY ON THE NEXT RELEASE!"
2,Just Horrible.,"This is a spoof on martial arts movies like Three Stooges movies are here only this one isn't funny. Everyone giggles all through this entire film and has Chinese guy complete with buck teeth that stick out an inch or so from his mouth. I paid for it or I'd never have watched 5 minutes of this ridiculous film.The movie would be great for kids up to let's say 12 years old that see humor in stupid foolish things. How Jet Li got himself into this is amazing to me for I'd fire my agent immediately. People fly around and no one gets hurt, and it's just a very poor film for ANYONE that has EVER seen a good film."
2,ramra8,Very disappointed in this one. He sounds like he had a difficult time going from classical to what ever he intended this to be. I'm sure he feels avant-garde but it sounds like he missed the keys at some points.I wish that I had not purchased this CD.
4,Scottish Bride - Nice Addition,"Catherine Coulter faithfully follows her Sherbrooke series with this latest addition. Tysen Sherbrooke in the previous Bride books was rather irritating but in the latest finally seems to develope the wit and charm that characterized his brothers. Mary Rose, our leading lady, is at times rather insipid but remains charming as a whole. The Scottish Bride is light entertainment but still worth the read."
2,"Bloody he** , Why did I waste my money on this?!","Don't mistake me. I love Coutler books. I have a huge collection of them, my favorite of course being The Sherbrooke Bride. I loved the Bride series, and the following Mad Jack and Courtship, but this book left me high and dry. I have never felt the need to skim a Coulter book, but unfortunately this book did not hold my interest. Tyson is a nice character. Mary Rose is a nice character. But they are both so boring at times I wanted to scream! It seemed to be that Coulter once she gave these characters their traits, she wasn't sure what she wanted to do with them. The only reason why I even finished this book was to read about the other Sherbrookes, especially my honey Douglas. My suggestion to all of those interested, wait until you can check it out from your local library."
3,Scottish Bride,"I have been a Catherine Coulter fan for so many years. As far as I can tell I have all of her books. The Scottish Bride was a delightful surprise, I hadn't anticipated his story coming out. It always seemed that while Douglas, Ryder and Sinjun loved their brother, he was kind of the odd one out.I laughed all through the book. I was constantly amused at how surprised Tysen was that he was as passionate as his siblings. Only Ms. Coulter could take the prig of a brother and turn him into a passionate preacher. Showing all of us that God gave us faith and love and that the two mix very well. As another writer said when you mix sex and heart you get romance!Catherine, you've given great pleasure over the years and I can't wait for your next book, be it historical or contemporary.BEE"
3,shop vac,"It's a good vacuum cleaner but they could have done better. First it came complete with dents, the factory makes no provision for damage prevention. The cord is OK but the clips used to wind it to the cleaner are such that they are difficult to get to and winding the cord is pointless so I just coil it up. It is top heavy and tends to fall over when all the accessories are in the rear mounted basket. The wheels are cheap plastic and could be bigger. Most of all, it is poswerful, but the suction is not all that great becasue of the 3"" tubing creating a large volume of air that needs to be pushed through. IF you reduce the size of the accessories it gives better performance but you lose the ability to suck in larger pieces of materials. I expected better but it works well enough. BUT, very poor qaulity control in my estimation. Will go with another brand next time."
2,Isn't it ironic?,"It is ironic that this guy's name is Kornfield and his stories and little talks are so ""Korny"". This video would appeal to the California Newage Hippie crowd. The teacher's voice is cloying but it seems to work for the students in the room. This DVD was distasteful to me, but read the other reviews and maybe it will be for you (in case you're wondering, I preferred Maritza's DVD.)"
3,The pretty American did it...,"This book is kind of one of the mysteries where too much effort was madeto make a plotand not enough in trying to make it worth reading?Some old guy winds up with a pitch fork in his throatand he is very old and a widower, it seems a lot like why would any body want to... We get more on the fits of the detective than onany real passion here. It seems to be about a British rent a backyardsystem that is having trouble with corporate urban renewal plans,but is really about a face cream? Like who really cares by the end or the book: boring mystery."
3,"Not bad, but not the greatest","This book was pretty good, but some parts were rather underdeveloped. The title was not altogether fitting."
4,Smooth Jazz at Premium Class,Listening to his music it's a true enjoyable moment.The dynamic rythm show his own premium class.Last the only thing that I miss from this CD is the recording quality. I wish they will launch the SACD or XRCD version very soon so we can enjoy with good high-end setup.
3,Unnecessary,"If you have a couple other Grey Eye Glances album, there is really no reason to buy this one, being largely redundant of material better arranged and produced on other albums. Unless you're just a die-hard fan and just have to have every single thing they've done, don't waste your money."
1,Stay away,"I have the same problems as other reviewers. Stay away from this computer. Worst purchase I have ever made. There should be a class action suit brought against HP for this computer. Non-existant technical help. They will, however, sell you help....that will probably not fix your problems. I am still under warranty but that means nothing."
4,Southern Heavy Metal,"This is one of the many bands formed by ex-Pantera members. I enjoy it greatly. I just think that there are too many ballads. that is why it got 4 stars instead of 5. Phil Anselmo sings, Rex Brown plays bass andd COC's Pepper Keenan plays guitar. It sounds quite Black Sabbathy, with a southern tinge. Lysergik Funeral Procession and Beautifully Depressed are among the best songs on the album. I like it."
1,not HP compatible,"Bought this 56 thinking it would work for my HP all-in-one. It worked great one the first printout! The 2nd time i tried to print, printing became unbelievable slow. Then kaput!! Read error every time i try to reinsert it. I put the old HP cartridge back in, and it read! Put this one in once again, then Error.Just saying,may not be compatible with HP psc lines"
4,Weather Radio,"Like this radio , I would buy it again. Sound is ok on the weather channels but sounds tinny on the AM & FM stations"
2,Don't buy for the clock radio!,"Got this to combine the clock radio/alarm and the weather radio for the bedroom. In theory, that should work but. . .no. Sure, the weather alarm dealio works. You program it and away you go. Yes, it does function as a clock alarm but(and its a big but)the display is very hard to read. The back light is either way too bright or very dim. The icons that show if alarm is on or off, are very small. The device lays flat so you can't just glance at it from your bed to get the time. So, now the thing lives across the room as just the basic weather radio and sometime musical distraction. Lesson learned."
4,Great weather radio,"We put this in our dining room and have NO trouble hearing it throughout the house. Sometimes the warnings go off repeatedly for hours which can get annoying. But, better annoyed and safe then sorry"
5,MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio,Radio performs as designed and does it well. It replaced an older model that would not pick up a clear signal. We live in the mountains of East Tennessee and this radio's sound is clear and the signal strong. Easy to set up. Almost purchased a second one for the first floor of our cabin but my wife advised she could hear the radio well enough on the first floor (it is on the second floor).
5,MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio,"Its from midland! nuff said. If you live in severe weather prone areas, you would be nuts not to have this radio. Large back lit display, fast and easy set up are just a few of the many features this radio offers.Oh and trust me the severe weather alerter WILL wake you up!The order, packing and shipping were on the mark or above average. Thank you Amazon!"
2,Disappointed in blocking feature,"Our first weather radio is the Midland S.A.M.E. Weather/All Hazards A, which will wake you up in the middle of the night even for a severe thunderstorm watch, and keep waking you up. We bought the Midland WR300 because it appeared we could block certain types of alerts. You can, but you cannot block Tornado watch nor several other types. Personally, we want to be routed out of bed in the middle of the night for a tornado WARNING only. We returned the radio and purchased a Reecom 1630 directly from mfr. which I *can* program to block severe thunderstorm warnings and tornado watch alerts, and we can now sleep through the night unless danger is imminent."
3,NOAA weather radio,Looks like a great radio but still not sure if I have alarm programmed properly? Would likr clear and succinct directions about setting up for severe weather and less detail about SAME set up. A little dauting for set up but will catch on.
1,Terrible Product!,"Got the radio today and out of the box I have the following problems:The AM/FM radio is awful. I can hear two radio stations at the same time. Also, a few radio stations can be heard over many, many different frequencies. Totally useless feature.Many of the so-called selectable alerts shown in the manual are not available on the radio's menu, including Tornado Warning, Bio Hazard Warning, Civil Danger Warning, Civil Emergency Statement, Earthquake Warning, Immediate Evacuation, and many many others. They simply do not appear on the list of choices, so they are not selectable.A total waste of money. The radio will be going back ASAP."
4,Best so far,"I have purchased several weather radios, and this is the best one so far when it comes to function and price. There are at least two challenges 1) the LEDs are dim and do not flash--bright flashing LEDs are attention getting features available on other radios, and 2) the instructions are difficult, but not impossible to follow. Some of the instructions are counter intuitive and some steps might be missing."
4,Nice Weather Radio,Good looking product. Little difficult getting it programed. Impressed enough with it to order a second one for our son and family for Christmas
3,Weather alert review,This radio works very well after you get it programmed. I am still learning how to use the features. I had to get my children to help me to program it. the display is hard to see-- I wish the display was larger.
1,Very weak weather band,"I am very near a major city and this radio cannot pick up any of the three weather stations that are indicated for my area. I walked around the house and can only find one place where I can marginally pick up a station. Unfortunately, the radio can not be placed there. Without the weather band it is just a medium quality AM/FM radio."
5,Good Performer,"After owning this alert radio for several months, it has fully met my expectations for weather alerts. While getting it setup was a bit involved, the process was clearly spelled out and went without a significant problem. One feature I really like about this model is the ability to set alarms by type and level of emergency. This makes the few extra dollars for the 300 model well worth it. The alarm is LOUD and will wake you at night, so you probably don't need it to go off for every type of watch and warning. Ours has sounded, correctly, twice for tornado warnings...the main reason we purchased it. The alarm can be heard throughout the house. The unit can be easily hidden behind a picture or set on a bookshelf. Our only use has been as a weather alert/weather radio and it performs these tasks admirably.Recommended!"
1,proceed with caution,"Worked flawlessly for 1.5 years, then failed. Seems its a common problem. Cheap build. No customer service. They will ship a new one if you send your old one in and send $45. Check out this link[...] and also check out the reviews with 1 star. Midland is losing its name as a reputable company. I will not buy another midland product."
2,Not what I wanted,"I was looking for a good weather radio alarm clock. Radio is crap no reception even with the wip extended. It reminds me of some $1 radio at a check out. I have a hard time even finding stations. The display is at a bad angle for viewing if in bed and its on your night stand. If you want the display always lit you can set that up but your room is all lit up bright, way bright. I wanted the an alarm that would wake me up to the radio and this is only an alarm sound. I found a station that came in sort of clear ( a very close station ) when I came back in the room it wouldnt pick the station up. I have a few other radios and they pick up a lot better than this. NWS comes in ok but I am unsure if it picks up all the alerts it hasnt went off yet and we have had bad weather. I wish I would of paid more and got another CC Radio."
1,Many Nice Features but No Reception On Any Channel,This was my second Midland brand radio. The first unit had less features and worked great for the past few years. Unfortunately this new unit had no reception in the same location as the previous radio or anywhere else in the house (all channels). I can not recommend this product to anyone. If I could I would give this product ZERO stars on this review (so disappointed). I just bought a nice super deluxe paper weight.
3,decent,This radio is pretty decent. The reception is ok. I am about 10 miles from the broadcast tower and it works pretty well. At times it goes flaky and you have to move the antenna around.
1,Not worth the money,"This was the first of two Midland radios that I bought. After working just fine for about two months, all of the sudden the ability to recieve SAME alerts and the local alert channels, stopped. The radio works for listening to local stations, but not anything else. I tried to return the product, but it was out of Amazon's return policy by a few days. I contacted Midland a couple of times, and never even got the time of day. I purchased another radio, hoping that this was a fluke, but sadly, the EXACT same thing happend. I put the new radio in the bedroom while this one stayed in the living room. This radio sat in the ONE spot, never moved, never touched, until one day I got a weather alert on my computer, but NOT on the unit. Upon further inspection, it said it had no connection. Very frustrating!!"
2,Not sure about this weather radio!,"I bought this weather radio because we can't hear the tornado sirens where we live and I thought it would be helpful to know if there were any warnings at night. I thought I would also be able to see what time it was in the dark. After 2 nights of being blinded by the bright blue light when trying to see the time we turned the light off and put our old alarm clock on a different dresser. So now we have what looks like 2 alarm clocks in our bedroom!! I really don't know if it works or if we have it set right because we havn't had any warnings yet. To make a long story short, this radio has a sucky display and is confusing to set!!"
4,Midland WR300 Weather Radio,"This is a very good weather radio and is attractive. I would give it 5 stars, except for one issue. The display is very difficult to see because the LCD image is too narrow. For this reason, it does not make good AM/FM clock radio. The display is back lit, but is either fully on or fully off and is too bright to be on at night because it illuminates your bedroom. But, the primary purpose for this radio is weather alert and it provides that nicely. I do recommend this radio to those who want a reliable weather alert radio."
1,"Maybe it will work, maybe it won't.","There is only one place in the entire house where the alarm on this will function and that's only if it's pointing in the right direction and sitting at the perfect angle. When I clean the counter where it rests, it's a struggle to return it to that perfect alignment and I often think I've gotten it right only to find it blinking away to ""check reception"" an hour later. Ridiculous! The radio comes in crystal clear so I'm not sure why this thing can't receive the emergency broadcasts. Being so unreliable renders the product useless as a weather alert."
4,Motorolla NOAA Radio,"This weather radio performed as expected during the Tornadofest that hit the southeast the last week of April, 2011. Moved the radio to the bedroom during the night but it did miss one Tornado warning for our area. I'm thinking it was due to the location of the unit in the bedroom more than anything."
5,Great Product But....,"Great product. But hard to set up. Once set up works great. Buy one, it may save your life."
1,Paperweight,That's all it's good for. I purchased this radio after my last one quit working. I have confirmed MULTIPLE times that the SAME codes are correct and that the radio is in an area in which it can receive a NWS signal. I live in an area that gets a lot of violent weather events - April 2011 there were 20+ tornadoes that came within a 5 mile distance North / South of my home. In March of 2012 I watched a tornado pass within 1/2 mile of my home and this thing never sounded. Since buying this WR-300 it only seems to work when it feels like doing so. Today my immediate area was under a tornado warning 4 different times and this thing never made a sound. The user manual is not very well written and leaves a lot of information / instructions out. Emails to Midland only garner the standard cut and paste responses from their big-book-o-answers.
3,Geat Radio,"Great Radio ,Butthe instructions bite.. I have spent weeks online on you tube trying to see how to program this radiothey want some special codes but they don't tell u where to get them so u haft to find it on your own..if they had better instructions this radio would rock .. and it can it u find the right codes..Good Luck...I am still looking...If u find them please let me know.."
2,Battery life very poor; does not signal when storms in area,"Probably an operator error, but can't figure out how to set it up properly and then test it if there are no storms in the area; the batteries seem to drain in 24 hours even when plugged into AC outlet; again could be operator error"
4,Close...,"works great, but just wish it (or the weather service) would trip it for winter weather advisories, high wind advisories, winter storm warnings and the like...... Not necessarily needing an alarm, but at least trip it so we know what and when"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I BOUGHT THIS LAST YEAR, IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR THE RADIO PART. YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE UNIT NEAR AN OPEN WINDOW TO GET THE WEATHER PART TO WORK. I GUESS IF I TOOK MY SIDING OFF???? I TRIED AN EXTERNAL ANTENNA, NO GOOD"
3,Not completely Intuitive . . .,"I received my MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio this week. I put batteries in it and started following the manual on how to set it up. I was just about to choose my Alert and ... my manual dropped off ... my manual was missing pages 9 - 16 . . . According to the table of contents, those pages cover everything on the alerts, the AM/FM radio and troubleshooting. Thankfully I have Google so I was able to find a copy online. I'm sure this isn't a one-off situation. Quality control wasn't up to par on the manuals!"
2,Its a crap shoot,"The unit does alert you to weather conditions, however,the speaker is terrible. you have to get real close to the unit to hear what is being said.I have another unit that I paid much less for that is easier to use and has clear sound.I am dissapointed with the unit and will be searching for a better one.The old one I currently have cannot be programmed for my area the Midland can.I chose this unit based on reccomendations by a ham radio group and another group because there are so many radios out there,but when you get right down to it,its a crap shoot.Quality is no longer an issue for manufacturers anymore."
2,Worked fine for months then stopped working,"I received this as a Christmas gift last year and was ecstatic to use it. It worked like a charm for months. Then the batteries went dead so I decided to update it them. After changing the batteries, the device no longer worked. Static and no clear reception at all - just white noise. Very disappointed by this. It worked great for months until I changed the batteries. I'd still recommend this product but just be weary about it that's all."
4,Midland WR3000,"This product does all that is asked of it-keep us safe and aware of potential dangerous weather conditions, especially when sleeping. The only suggestion for improvement is the ""backlight"" options. I would suggest an option for the time being visible, w/o the entire blue area being lit, (which is too bright for sleeping)."
3,PROGRAMING PROBLEM,"I THINK IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT I AM HAVING TROUBLE PROGRAMING IT. I WISH THEY MADE IT EASIER TO PROGRAM.MR WANDREY"
4,"Weather Radio, probably would work great if...","If the antennae was stronger, this little device would probably work great. Easily programmable alerts, FM and AM radio stations, but for some reason it does not have a strong weather channel reception, which is what this device is really for. I don't live in the boonies and am 7-10 minutes from the city proper, but it does not receive the weather advisory signals."
5,Midland WR300,Easy to set up for my specific area. Like that it is very clear and I like the warning sound. Good buy for the money.
2,Of limited value,"If you've been to Barcelona, this book will help you reminisce. That's pretty much it.The story is quite bland. A ring of thieves attack the city, and the main character, an American lesbian freelance translator, gets caught in the middle of it. In pursuit of the bad guys, she goes up and down Barcelona and its beautiful monuments.The plot is thinnish and i HATED the ending (don't worry, i won't reveal it... but i found it very frustrating). This book is mediocre beach material.If you really want to learn more about Barcelona, pick up anything by Eduardo Mendoza. Now, that's good writing!"
5,Breakaway!!,"This is the home of one of my favorite DISCO tracks. having been a child of the 60's and 70's music scene and then a DJ from 1981 on I am a great fan of great R&B and disco. ""Breakaway"" from this collection makes me happy any time I hear it. If you remember ""Lovin' Is Really My Game"" by Brainstorm, ""Breakaway"" was always my track of choice to mix out of it. NOTHING else paired with it as well! The fact that ""Breakaway"" stands VERY well on it's own notwithstanding, some of my headiest DJ moments were watching my crowd lose it's mind when I put those two tracks together! Thanks for a SLAMMIN' track!"
3,sometimes Moe. is less,"It's not that I didn't like this cd, but it is not as good as some moe fans might have you beleive. I guess that's why they're fans. It is a solid 'OK'. If you're a lyrics person, you may be frustrated by the many repeats. If you're of the jam-centric crowd, you may be frustrated by the uninspired sessions found here. Reminds me of the Freddy Jones Band."
5,Very thought provoking,"This book is an excellent view of the M&A process from a very different angle. Many books cover the mechanics of the process, but this one looks at the outcomes for human beings - our most important assets. I would recommend it highly."
2,COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER!,"This book has its moments, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone. It is full of errors, contradictions, omissions, misspellings, etc. Having previously read another of Billy Harry's books,(""The Ultimate Beatles Encyclopedia"") I knew that he wasn't too keen on hiring a good proofreader, but the Lennon book is just too much!!"
4,Cornball stuff but the kids will love it,"The Jimmy and Joe series is marvelous for children aged 3-8 . Each story harkens back to a simpler, wholesome time. And the plots usually chug along with events that kids find sufficiently interesting and funny. ""Jimmy and Joe Find a Ghost"" is no exception. The ghost mystery will keep the youngsters in your house engrossed. Imagine a time when the grocery owner from the main street of your suburban town permits kids to go over to his brand new house to indulge their belief that there might be a ghost to be found there. And of course, the doors are not kept locked....and noone so much as comments on how odd that is. The pictures are great, too. One particularly amusing illustration is the dopey smile on the 'ghost' at the end of the story. Yeah, it's obviously a stretch on the imagination, but this kind of goofiness is a huge hit with the little ones."
1,Fiasco,"Everyone likes perfection in arts, and some people don`t even mind uglyness. It is mediocrity that is really scary, and this is what this album is.I have been Lotti`s fan for many years, and this is the WORST of his work I`ve heard so far. The great voice of his is NOT being utilized to its utmost, the music totally LACKS originality, and - overall - ""What`s you point here?""I would not hesitate to recommend other albums by Helmut Lotti to anyone who loves good music, but with this one - do NOT buy it, unless you have too much money and you are eager to get rid of some!!"
1,Why did they have to ruin a great classic movie by saying G--D---,"I was excited to watch this movie with my daughter who just completed the book. And very excited to see how she had retained so much of the book, and was really enjoying this classic--------SO DISAPPOINTED to find the unnecessary language in a CHILD's classic-------What was/is Disney thinking---why did they feel they had to place G--D--- in an otherwise wonderful movie."
3,huck finn is hot!!,"i like this movie coz it has brad renfro in it, he's sooo cute. and i think the acting is good i only seen it on tv once but i love brad so yeah=)"
4,I like it,It is what I wanted and I so like the actors and actresses. Received it in time and was in great working order. Thank you
4,Geri returns - good or bad?,"Geri Halliwell has finally done a good song that deserved to go to #1 in the UK. The ratio of the song that I like is 90% music and 10% vocals.Geri has been slated one of the worlds worst singers and most voted to be kicked out of the studio - but hey, shes enjoying her life so what can you do about.However, the song is a re make of the Weather Girls 'Its Raining Men' back in the old days. Geri has somehow proved herself to get in my good books.The single is an uptempo dance number which has a fantastic beat. The video isn't too bad either. If you thought her last singles 'Look at me' & 'Bag It Up' were good, ya gonna love this."
5,Best album that Wu-members have released!!,"The great producer RZA has put his best out again. On the album there are featuring Wu-Tang stars : Cappadonna, Raekwon, RZA, Method Man, Masta killah, Inspectah Deck and a special quest star Mary J. Blige. This album is absolutely great!!"
5,Ironman,"First off let me tell everyone that Amazon has two different versions of this album, the original release of this album has 17 tracks and the song ""The Soul Controller"" is on it at track 16, now on the newer version of this album it only has 16 tracks and ""The Soul Controller"" is not on there due to sample clearances. Luckily the one I found had it. Now on the review, Ghostface did his thing on here with the classic ""All That I Got Is You (Feat. Mary J)"" which is one of the most heartfelt songs in hip hop history. ""The Faster Blade"" is a Raekwon solo, which is very dope, ""Wildflower"" Ghost has some harsh words to say about a disloyal female he was dealing with, then you have ""Marvel"", ""Motherless Child"",""Camay"" & ""Winter Warz"" (Where Cap spits one of the best verses of all time). Every song on here is worth listening to this is a classic Hip Hop album."
4,Ghost spits flamin darts y'all,"Ghostface's first solo album feat. two of my other fav emcees with Rae and Cappa. With a team like that how can you go wrong? In my opinion not as strong as Only Built... but still a great album, nevermind a great Wu album. I rembmer when All That I Got dropped I was stunned. Ghost paints such a vivd picture of how he grew up and gave us a glimpse into his life. Also with such great Wu songs as Winter Warz, Daytona 500, Camay, Assassination Day, Iron Maiden, and Marvel, this album is definatly worth your money. You can see the evolution of Ghost into one of today's best emcees with his slang verses. To the untrained fan you might be guessin at what he's sayin, but to the veteran of Wu, y'all know exactly what he's sayin .. BUY IT"
3,"Toys like this needs a parents interaction, to learn ,","This toy offers a start to learning a game if the parent wants to be involved. Play awile, put away and your child will enjoy it more and you can have a game to enjoy together. The child will look forwardto it. thanks, remember toys are for fun and learning, not to babysit."
5,Wonderful Book,This book is a rich insight into race relations in the early 1900's. The author is a muckraking journalist at his best by living with and interviewing the people affected by racialism.
3,Average,The only reason that I gave the book 3 and not 2 stars is because of the full illustration accompanying the chapters. Other than that it is quite difficult to follow. Better write down the acronyms as you go along or else you will be lost. Very limited index.
5,"I need a vacation, all this action has left me exhausted!",My favorite writing team has another winner. Only draw back was all the nonstop action didn't leave much time for the main characters to interact with each other. Loved the back ground story of Il Maestro. Look forward to more adventures with Ethan and Micaela popping in.
5,It is a cool 60's view of space travel in the future,"This story has some odd gaps in the story line, such as the overpopulation of 9 billion people? well, it still is an excellent book worth reading if you want a space drama from the perspective on a country telepath."
3,"80's style 80's drama, todays heart","This movie was heartwarming, funny, stylish & yet also had a slight 'brat pack' feel with some angsty ""we're really adults now, OMG"" moments.If you like Kevin Bacon, this is a good movie, but if you don't, don't worry. Its not just about him. Elizabeth McGovern was really good & you where able to see some fun moments."
4,Da Man,"I thought that this wasn't bad;Honda's dj skillz are improving,but his new albulm is a definate must if you haven't already purchased it.The funk level on this album has hit an alltime high,so make sure you grab this one two!"
4,Must See,"If you haven't seen this film yet, hurry up and do so. It is well written, acted, directed and choreographed. The story line is excellent and Julia Stiles steals the show. Can't say enough good about it."
5,Great Movie,"I think this movie has a little bit of everything to please everybody. It has the romance for the women and teen girls, The gangs and violence for the teen boyus and the men, and it's a good date movie because of the romance and love stuff. I loved this movie and urge everybody to buy it. It was my second favorite movie. My favorite being 10 things I hate about you also Julia Stiles. GREAT MOVIE!"
4,Hey at least it had a message,"Well I though this movie was pretty funny as a comedy, and hey it had a decent message. The lives of the primary characters were going downhill when they were ""getting wasted"" every night, and once they took control of their lives things turned around. Hey it was funny too. Yah it didn't win any academy awards, but that is just actors giving other actors awards anyway, so I tend to ignore that."
1,Save the Last Dance (Special Collector's Edition),"I NEVER RECEIVED THIS DVD. I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT ON 5/21/08, AND MADE PAYMENT VIA CREDIT CARD. TO DATE, 6/21/08 I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT. THE VENDOR TO WHOM I MADE PAYMENT HAS NOT SENT THE DVD.WILL CONTACT BE MADE WITH VENDOR TO HONOR HIS COMMITMENT? I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE REGARDING THIS MATTER.HERBERT GREVIOUS"
1,Interracial romantic stereotyping at it's finest!,I hate interracial romance movies they are all the same. It's always a black-white pairing.As if to imply that in order for the race relations to improve we need to date white.As a black woman I find this annoying and insulting.So this movie is implying that whites are more open-minded about interracial dating get outta town!Most people date and possibly marry exclusive within their ethnic background. Interracial dating is an anomaly! Most couples want their offspring to look like them.I admit I find men of all races of attractive not just white men or in the case of black men they can appreciate the beauty of women of all races doesn't mean they're gonna tie the knot outside their ethnic background.
1,PURE TRASH!!,"Trash is the softest word for this ""movie"". If we can call it movie, has no plot, bad perfomance, bad music, bad direction, everything's bad, starting by Julia Stiles, trying to play to be an actress. Don't waste money and time."
1,Just not a good movie,"This movie, in my opinion, was boring. It had a lot of trash talk, no really good dancing, and a predictable ending. Julia Stiles was dull, but Sean Patrick Thomas was good, so if you like him watch it."
4,GREAT MOVIE - a must-see for RnB/Hip Hop fans,"Save the Last Dance is a fantastically entertaining movie. Ultimately uplifting, the movie follows the story of 17-year-old Sara who is forced to move into a mainly African-American neighbourhood and struggles to fit in with the crowd. Her love of dancing was cast aside after her mother's death and Save the Last Dance is all about how one boy helped her to rediscover her passion and talent with a new edge.This movie will have you laughing, crying and dancing with the loveable characters and the fun hip hop dance scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of some inspiration or to anyone with a lor of dance or music!"
5,FINALLY! a good movie!,"reaching your goal, falling in love, and overcoming diversity in the world today are all portrayed in this amazing movie starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas! i reccomend this movie for the young and young at heart!"
5,WOW!!!!!!!,WOW PEOPLE SAID THAT THIS WAS A CHICK FLICK!!! BUT IF YOU LIKE HIP-HOP YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! IT IS SO AUWSOME!!! I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE SAVE THE LAST DANCE 2!!! IT WAS SO AUWSOMNE!!!! IT IS A MOVIE TO WATCH OVER AND OVER!!!! IT REMINDS ME OF ME CAUSE IM MOVING TO SO I KINDA TOOK IT AND JULIA STILES!!!
2,Dang why you gotta play her like that Chenille!,"Sean Patrick Thomas is actually a good actor with some real potential, but even he can't save this movie (or the last dance). This movie is trying too hard to connect with the kids while at the same time attempting to display some emotional depth, while at the same time trying to highlight some real problems in African American culture. Instead of leaving a meaningful impact, it ends up creating mockups of a unique but troubled society. Don't try so hard Hollywood. Make a real genuine movie about the problems of inter-racial relationships OR make a movie about the struggles of under-privileged youth OR make a movie about the struggles of broken families. I like the idea, but the execution is laughable. And Julia, you should loosen up a little and get some soul. Buy a copy of Ali Farka Toure's Niafunke and chill out for a while before every shoot."
5,"If you love music, you'll love this","It's about a guy and a girl who fall in lov, there are ups and downs, but wow, the music's great! If you love RnB and to a lesser extent rap then watch this. The soundtrack is awesome. It features songs such as 'Get It On Tonite' by Montell Jordan which is a fab song, and 'All or Nothing'- a kinda RnB based orchestra track. (This is the song Sara dances to in her audition at the end). I love this film and have watched it loads of times just for the music. The storyline seems real, although it it a bit stereotypical with a single, teenage mother and a group of (teenage)thugs into drugs and crime. However, a great film. And as my review title says, if you love music(like me) you'll love this!"
4,like it,Good puchaseI dont mind giving reviews on items i purchased and would purchase again- but this requires so many words there is not much to say- I like it- glad i bought it- the reciepient liked it- it was just as described
5,Parker vs. Parker is _fantastic_!,"I don't know what I liked better in this excellent book, the Spidey/Bishop banter in the alternate universe, or the confrontation between the two Peter Parkers, which was just _amazing_. The ""main"" universe stuff was okay (I loved the Beast telling the Rhino he should rename himself ""the Hippo""), but the alternate universe was brilliant. Great stuff!"
2,RCA DRC8295N life span too short,"I've owned this DVD recorder for about 2 years. When it was new, it was a good unit with some nice editing features not found on other less expensive models. I transferred many VHS videos, and recorded hundreds of TV programs to disc with great results. For the past 3 or 4 months, though, it has been rejecting an increasing majority of blanks as having a ""disc error"" and not accepting them to record. I now have 200+ blank discs, and cannot record anything. So this is a good machine, but don't expect it to function for much more than a year."
2,Still Waiting for refund of shipping charges,"I had difficulties with this purchase. First one did not work and I had to ship to repair source for repair. Replacement works fine. However, I am still waiting for Digideals to reimbursement me for shipping costs."
5,Great!,"I am alergic to nylon, so must wear cotton. These are the best quality cotton briefs that I have found at a reasonable price."
5,Cotton Briefs,"This item had some less than ideal reviews, but I decided to take a chance. I would purchase these again as I have no problems with them."
5,Great briefs!,"Hanes makes a quality product, for the most part! I love these cotton briefs; they are well made, run true to size, and are of good quality cotton, long lasting. I highly recommend these Hanes briefs, and I would definitely order again and again."
4,Connect 4 Game,"This is a great game involving skill. It comes with a plastic frame, and small chips. You have to try to get 4 in a row. The players have to put their own color chip into one of the rows in the frame. Gravity pulls them down to the bottom, which makes it harder. You must get 4 in a row in any which direction (Horizontal, Vertical, and Diagonal). This will amuse and keep your kids busy for hours! Recommended for ages 6 and up."
2,Formulaic Murder Mystery!,"This film is reminiscent of 'The Silence Of The Lambs' and 'Seven', both much better films. The editing, narrative style, atmosphere and screenlay are all handled wronly. The only good thing are the commanding performances by Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. Formulaic, tedious and overlong. Could of been better, but the ending really brings it down, it seems dumb and out of place. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 5!"
4,Specimens...,"A serial-killer / collector called Cassanova is stalking, abducting, and murdering beautiful, young women. Dr. Cross (Morgan Freeman from SE7EN) must help police track him down before he kills again. Cassanova's latest victim (Ashley Judd from BUG) escapes, giving authorities their first big break. Ms. Judd is tough and believable in her role as a kickboxing doctor. As nutty as that may sound, she pulls it off brilliantly! Freeman plays his psychologist / cop character w/ his usual ease. The rest, including the badguys, are mere fodder. KISS THE GIRLS isn't the best thriller ever made, but it is a good one. Co-stars Cary Elwes (SAW)..."
4,"Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!","A very good movie, Kiss the Girls, sheds light on a series of disappearances of young girls in North Carolina.There are slight hints of Seven, The Bone Collector, Resurrection, and The Silence of the Lambs so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category, though it is way far removed from that level of gore and horror.Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!Overall, though not a masterpiece it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment."
5,Judd and Freeman team up for great film.,"I have to say. I am very critical about my thrillers. Don't get me wrong. They are my favourite, but they have to be VERY good. So for me to have liked this movie, it had to be VERY good. And guess what??? It was VERY good.!!!!!!! I simply loved it. Freeman once again outdoes himself in playing a detective tracking down a serial killer. When one of his own family members becomes the next victim, he turns to the only one he thinks can help him,: An escaped victim of the killer and also a doctor, played by the one and only Ashley Judd."
3,Better than typical,Poet at heart serial killer chooses victims who he does not wish to kill (all girls) and locks them in separate chambers in a basement tunnel forcing them to later perform tricks for him. Detective/Psychologist who is the uncle of one of the girls follows the path of the abductions until it leads him to one of the victims who escapes and aids the police in tracking him down. Above average beginning and goes along being so until the usual elements slip in: two different culprits and a very disappointing killer. Judd and Freeman do what they can and well enough to make this a so-so thriller.
2,Silly premise,"Sure, it's a fun movie, but it's best not to look too closely at the absurdity of it. We have here a serial killer who despite his 40 hour week still finds time to keep a dozen or so women inside his underground slave-brothel. Think about it. This chap doesn't even have a concierge on his staff let alone a maid or a chef. Thik of all the groceries he'd have to buy, the meals he'd have to prepare, the clothes he'd have to wash and the toilets he'd have to keep running. He may be a ruthless sex-villain but it's hard not to feel just a little sory for him. And speaking of toilets, there weren't any in the girls' cells. Nor was there any sign of baths or showers. The killer was supposed to be an admirer of Casanova but there was never any suggestion that Casanova liked his women filthy. No, this is a typical hollywood film that may stir the blood for a short while, but which is so poorly thought out that the viewer never really suspends disbelief and never forgets that it's only a movie."
3,Bootleg copy?,"I got a used copy from a seller on Amazon, How can I tell if it's a bootleg copy? The one disc is shiney on both sides. Has only a little ring on both sides with the name and some information, including the numbers N4438.1.B Region 1. I've nver seen or bought a dvd like this. The packaging is cardboard and plastic- has all the picture and movie information...."
3,"Enchanting little tale, but...","This movie, i.e., VHS The Adventures of Pinocchio, is fairly well done, but doesnt really exhibit the charm and fantasy that the other film adaptations have given. The main reason is because I saw this in the cinema and was hoping for a fairy, and there was none. People who can sit through a movie without magic may up this a star, but I look for enchantment."
4,Well made fanatsy film.,"A lonely puppetmaker (Oscar-Winner:Martin Landau in a Impressive Role), who made a Puppet, the shape of a Little Boy. He wishes one night, that his Puppet would become a Real Boy (Voiced by Jonathan Talyor Thomas) and it came true but in the form of a Puppet.Directed by Steve Barron (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Coneheads) made a good entertaining film, based on a novel by Carlo Collod`s Fable. Good Supporting Cast including:Genevieve Bujold, Udo Kier, Bebe Neuwirth and Rob Schnieder. This was a Box Office Disappointment in Theaters but it did better on Video. Walt Disney`s animated version is much better but this is bit different from Disney`s Version. Great Special Effects done by Jim Henson`s Creature Shop. Panavision. Grade:B+."
3,Good movie.,I somewhat enjoyed this movie but thought the story was a little boring because it didn't exactly mimmic the animated version.
1,One sided account of a family tragedy.,"I only read about 1/3 of this book because I couldn't stand the one-sided nature of it. I realize that Greg and Nancy didn't allow interviews, but they were shown in such a negative light. This just plain isn't true. If you can't get the full story, don't write the book. It shows Greg as a spoiled momma's boy and Jeff as the perfect, hard-working son. You didn't get the whole story! Not worthy of any mroe of my time."
1,Misleading info,"This product staes it works for CB radios as well as weather radios, it does not as the antenna comes with an RCA connection... There are no adapters the will covert this too... I had to buy another antenna.."
1,Order Cancelled,"I have made my order with the company Abacus24-7.I ordered on Sunday, and now on Wednesday the order is cancelled."
5,Worked great at a great price,"We purchased a used Sony Sureshot DSC-W1 with out the memory stick for $8.00. The camera works great with this memory stick and for less than we could get it at a camera store. An earlier post had trouble and only 1 GB but, we have the full 4 GB of memory and it works great."
4,4G memduo great buy,I recently got my PSP and had a 1g and just couldnt save enough data. I was very pleasantly surprised with the price I checked out the local stores and they were much more expensive. It works the way its supposed to and was prety cheap.
3,this meet my need. Shipping fee is unreasonable.,I should charge only one shipping. But it charge 3 shipping fees from one shipment.
5,awesome,This thing holds everything. I always have space for more; like my homework for example...its gotten me outta a lot of tight spaces if you know what i mean (not having my hw with me). Im very happy with my purchase. fast transfer speeds + large storage space = happy me.
1,not what was advertised,This was listed as a retail package but came in a shipping envelope with no packaging. I have not tested the item but would say it is a knock off and will try and get my money back. I went on Amazon so this would not happen. I am surprised that amazon would allow items like this to be sold on there site.
2,How handy are you?,"After receiving my Sony Memory Stick Pro and the adapter, I had to disassemble the adapter and beburr all the excess plastic from the end with the contacts.There was so much of it the brass contacts could barely be seen. This is no easy task! After 20 minutes of fine beburring,it worked perfectly. If you aren't capable of this kind of work, I would steer clear of this product, even at the low price."
4,Good,"This dress was very nice, the color was beautiful and the form aswell. The only bad thing about it was that the length was too long for me. There are miner details about the dress that I did not like, but the total impression was good. I do not regret this buy."
4,Forrest Gump,"I hated this movie at first. I had to go out in the lobby during the combat scene. Even though I did not go to Vietnam, I felt like I did. Forrest moves from Elvis and The Beatles to the disco era. He finds himself in Washington, D.C., the ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. I later developed an affection for Tom Hanks' character when I went to D.C. with my son. We joked about Forrest's girl friend, Jenny, running through the Reflecting Pool. The story ends with Jenny dying of AIDS. Seeing the quintessential boomer life unfold can be painful."
5,The best feel-good film ever.,"This film is a masterpiece. Tom Hanks excels in his role as Forrest Gump and Sally Field is excellent too, as his mother. This film is moving, yet funny and is the best feel-good film ever. Zemeckis' direction is flawless and the story just flows smoothly and fills the audience with joy. One of the best films ever made."
1,ONE OF THE WORST FILMS EVER,"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN.IT TRIES SO HARD TO DEAL WITH OTHERWISE MEANINGFUL ISSUES.HOWEVER, IT FAILS ON ALL OF THEM.OVER RATED ACTOR T.HANKS IS AT HIS USUAL WORST.AVOID IT!"
1,A big old lie,"Having worked for many years with the mentally retarded I was shocked by Hanks portrayal. He has taken a serious and debilitating human condition and turned it into a cheap and tawdry satire. He has created the impression that people with this disability can achieve a level of functioning that is, through no fault of their own, impossible, and further eroded tolerance for these people by creating the impression that they do not achieve these impossible goals simply because they have no ambition or willingness to do so. If my children were still young you can bet they would not see this. Only Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor the Vietnam amputee turned alcoholic indicated any empathy with the human condition."
5,He's as dumb as a doorknobe but we love him,Tom Hank's plays the stupid Forrest Gump who somehow went to college played football how he made the team the football coach saw Forrest running on the field. Their team became champion's and went to the white house to meat JFC. Forrest drank too much drinks and had to go pee. Forrest got his degree then went to the army he fought in Vietnam and earn the highest metal the army can give you (The Congressional Medal of Arnor) then Forrest pulled his pants down.
2,Is this supposed to be a cartoon?,"I've heard about 'Forrest Gump' for years, and recently I decided to rent it. Is this movie supposed to be a cartoon? I know movies can be unrealistic, but this movie is SO RIDICULOUSLY UNREALISTIC I found myself staring at the screen in disbelief. What did this man not do in his lifetime? It's as though he has been blessed by God and everything falls into his hands. The moral of the story.. STAY STUPID AND OBLIVIOUS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND MIRACLES WILL HAPPEN TO YOU."
1,Stupid Is as Robert Zemeckis Does,"I almost feel stupid writing the 152nd review of this movie, but I couldn't pass up the chance to lower the average rating. This movie is so stupid, that I resent Robert Zemeckis for the three hours of my life I'll never get back, and I have taken a vow never to see another of his films again. Not only do I wish I had never seen Forrest Gump, I wish there were some way I could not see it twice.This movie belongs in the section of Video World with Plan 9 from Outer Space, Robot Monster, and Sgt. Pepper.If I had nothing better to do, I'd sit here all night, voting 1 star 151 times just to lower the average even further, but really I should be in bed, and not giving any more time to this stupid, stupid movie."
5,Magnificent!,"Due to all the hype with the release of this movie, I avoided it like the plague. I was sure it would be a chick flick (hey, not all chicks like them) and didn't want to waste the time. I came across Forrest Gump while sick in bed one day and GRUDGINGLY sat through the first 15 minutes, only to find myself hooked. Tom Hanks is absoulutely amazing, making the viewer believe he is Forrest - the supporting cast (Sinise, Wright) is great. Nothing can compare to Forrest meeting his son for the first time (a soon to be VERY well known Haley Joel Osment). Needless to say, I now own this video, and I recommend it without reservations."
4,"Incredible movie, but&#65533;",One of the best pictures made in recent years on two discs and is loaded with extras. But come on Paramount: Where's the DTS audio for us theater-philes?
3,Good . . . but not the best,"I liked this movie a lot, but I hardly thought it deserved the oscar for Best Picture. The Shawshank Redeption, a much more moving film, should have gotten Best Picture."
2,Didn't Tom Hanks have anything better to do?,"Okay movie with a good performance by Hanks. If I could I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. It is hard to really like a movie when you can actually feel it trying to yank out your hearstrings like a Hollywood surgeon, though. Had it not been so obviously manipulative, this could have really soared. ...and talk about wasting Robin Wright. Zemeckis is the last person on Earth that should have been given this project."
4,Great movie,Wish it were a little cheaper but it was fun with the chocolate smelling paper and the feather...it was cute
5,Tom Hanks best movie,"Bought this so my kids could see where the ""Bubba Gump Shrimp Company"" restaurant came from, and so they could see what life was like in the South where I grew up."
2,A cinematic mess of a movie,"Forrest Gump can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or drama, but it doesn't really matter, since it fails at both. A mentally challenged man (Gump) gets caught up in increasingly improbable situations throughout the 20th century. There's no real overall story arc.... just a bunch of random situations strung together. I didn't care about any of the characters at all; Gump doesn't evolve as a person, and goes through the movie spouting terrible one-liners. Most of the other characters are just jerks.I went into this movie with an open mind when it first came out, and boy was I disappointed. I honestly never saw what the appeal of this movie was, as I thought it was literally one of the worst movies of the '90's. The only bits I enjoyed were the scenes in Vietnam, and the special effects are pretty good. That's why I gave this two stars instead of one."
2,Sorry Tom......,"I'm giving this movie two stars because of the supporting actors, and, the book from which the movie is taken. I believe those are what the rest of the reviews are truely applauding without realizing it.Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and, seems like a nice guy, but, he needs to figure out what movies he is 'right' for, and, which ones he should turn down.Tom, Tom .... that accent...ouch! Sounds like you NEVER tried actually talking to someone from Alabama. If you really did...well, honeychil', accents just aren't your thing - don't do no more of 'em!They should have asked an English actor - they do spot on southern accents. Maybe, it's time for a re-make with Jude Law. Forrest was not a handsome man in the book, but, apparently, that doesn't transfer to the screen, so, get a hottie who can do an accent. Tom's just makes my ears ache!"
5,Outstanding movie!,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Tom Hanks is a DAMN good actor and everyone else in it is great too! If you haven't seen this, MAKE SURE YOU DO, because you will NOT be disappointed!"
4,Life is Like a Box of Chocolates?,"Of course you know what you're gonna get, chocolate, duh! Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career as ""Forrest Gump."" The director, Robert Zemeckis was creative and brilliant with his vision. It's about a slow-minded man who did everything. Ran away from bullies, fought in Vietnam, got shot in the but-tocks, met the president, played ping-pong, ran some more (this time around the country) and ate shrimp. Yes, what a life. And then he finally got Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and had a little Forrest. You could tell by a person's shoes what kind of a life they had. If you look at my shoes, you'll see dirt and dog stuff all over them. What does that mean?"
5,El más astuto de todos,"Run Forrest, Run... Forrest Gump es un personaje que sin duda alguna nació con un retardo mental. Su mamá lo adora y hará por él todo lo que sea posible para que no se sienta discriminado. Durante toda la película vemos a un Forrest que crece pese a las adversidades y cómo ve la vida como una persona normal no sería capaz. Forrest Gump sale con frases tan sabias que lo dejan a uno como la H. Muda. Forrest Gump es un MUST en cuando a DVDs."
5,Classic,"Such as classic. Viewing the world through the eyes of a simple man that follows one motto: ""Ain't nothing to it but to do it."" I have a GUMP approach to life and let's just say that I have one amazing life. Tom Hanks could not have been a better actor for this role. I love the director - Robert Z because he directs in a way that elegant - simple communication that reaches all audiences. Classic."
5,a very touching movie,This movie was done so well. Tom Hanks is an amazing actor. I would recommend it to anyone. It really makes you think.
1,Aspect Ratio 2:35:1,"I bought a high definition wide screen TV to avoid letterbox!1:78:1 is the standard for wide screen high definition broadcast. Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park are 1:85:1. If they were 2:35:1 it would not make them any better. Both of those movies rocked! ATTN: Bob Zemeckis, It does not make the movie any better if you use only half the screen! Looks like one less sale for you."
1,This Movie is Garbage!,"I had the terrible misfortune of seeing this movie at a friend's house. I felt as though I should have been reimbursed for the time I wasted watching it. I was very offended by the mere premise of this ""film."" Don't question authority and try not to think too much. Just go through life in a haze and you'll achieve more than the guy who spent his life learning and working hard. Forrest Gump was such a half-wit he barely knew he was alive. Everything was made light of in this movie. Everyone who ever worked hard to accomplish anything was viewed as a joke and worst of all I couldn't figure out if this was a comedy, drama, or parody. It failed on all fronts. It was basically a big nothing. As a lover of movies, I must issue this warning: Stay away from Forrest Gump. Life is just too short to waste watching [a movie] like this."
1,ANOTHER OVERRATED FILM!!!,"The moviegoing public must have turned off their brains when they watched this mindless and stupid piece of contamination. Surprisingly, all the characters act meaningless and they were awfully acting. Plus, the special effects blending famous scenes from the past is just a distraction to keep away the viewer from realizing the filth of this overrated film that will remain, in my opinion, one of the worst films trying to be sympathetic!"
3,One for Tom Hanks fans!,Great blu-ray transfer! One of the best Tom Hanks movie!Although my copy came without the slipcover :(
5,One of the greatest movies of all time,This movie has to be on everybody's all time favorite list and it's even better on Blu-ray. I highly recommend that you upgrade your DVD copy to Blu-ray.
5,Must have for crime buffs or researchers,"Helmer and Mattix have delivered a fun format for such a massive delivery of entertaining information. As I flip through the pages, I feel this book is almost interactive in design-- photos followed by short stories and an on-going chronology of national events interspersed with important definitions and short bios of key players. More than an exhaustive reference work, this book is a one-volume library and definitely a must-have for anyone interested in crime history. Excellent gift idea, too, and a surprising value for the money."
5,Ridiculous,"The best live praise and worship I have heard on CD to date. This album is everything you want in a CD, especially if you love P&W. Vocally - Great, music/musicianship - Awesome, lyrics - deep. If you think about ""All Around"", the line that says ""Everywhere I look your love is all around"", is real deep. Just go outside to a park or something and look at nature. That's God's love all around us. God is REALLY using Israel, Aaron Lindsey, and New Breed. This is one of those few no skip albums that's hard to find now days. Favorites: ""Again I Say Rejoice"", ""Friend of God"", ""You've Made Me Glad"", ""Rise Within Us"", ""Another Breakthrough"", ""Here I Am To Worship"", and ""Holy"". If you been in a cave and haven't bought this yet, PLEASE get it."
5,The Best!!,"I don't think I've ever been so blessed by a CD. For years Fred Hammond was my favorite singer, hands down. That is until I heard Israel Houghton's ""Real."" Then I purchased ""Another Level."" I can honestly say that my life has been changed. My husband and I negotiate over who gets ""Israel"" for the day! We only listen to disc 2 (we love it so much we've just stuck with it). You will not be sorry if you purchase this incredible CD."
5,Two excellent games,"Two excellent games in this bundle. The characters are well drawn, and keep you interested and involved. The first game is characteristic of Sierra's adventure games from the early eighties - blocky, hand-drawn graphics. GK2 is full-motion video, and one of the best examples of the genre. It truly will make your heart race."
3,I don't think I would use this for fish..,"I got these as I needed two large storage bowls for some beads for a craft project for the kids- for that they are perfect! Durable and big. However, when I thought about a fish being in them, I am not sure I would do that- although they are pretty roomy, they are thick plastic and always seem to look dirty and they seem to get really warm I would be afraid the water might get warm- but I dont really know a whole lot about fish so it might be just fine!"
5,Nice,"My preschool loves putting on puppet shows with these, and my baby loves to watch them. Perfect for any little girl."
4,Kosinski reveals Blind Dates with our destiny,"Depicted in non-linear time frames, Kosinski dramatically succeeds in presenting the tumultuous life of one man, George Leventer. Associating with the powerful, beautiful, and lonely people around the world, Kosinski's character captures that elusive state of accepting the paradox of being powerful but lonely, requiring love but displaying violence, and growing old but questioning fate. His narrative is sharp and cinematic in structure and tone. Erotica is insightfully tamed and given in precise portions. I became entralled in dissecting the characters intentions as much as their decisions and actions. A superb study in pychological drama and state of consciousness. Please read it and THINK about what it has to say."
4,Nas It Was Written With A Reveiw Of 4 Stars!,"... It was written is a very good cd but nothing can beat stillmatic the only reason stillmatic is better though is because most of the songs are fast but on the cd it was written most of the songs are slow but if u have (or have heard) It was written u suggest you buy stillmatic the best song oon stillmatic is ""Got Ur Self A..."" (AKA Got Yourself A Gun) well get out there and buy some nas!!!"
5,This album is bangin!!!!,"The song with Lauryn Hill is all that! Also, I'd recommend this album to anyone who cares to know the truth about the hood life and survival of it.I love you NAS!"
4,Nas shows potential,"Nas has some pretty strong music on this album Th first 7 cut ar good, highlighted by the best Nas song of all time:Take it in Blood (#6). Songs like Blood,Watch dem Niggas, street Dreams, the Message, If I Ruled the World are the perfect example of how untouchable Nas is with decent production. And the production on these songs is great. We know he's the best MC already. The rest of the songs on the Cd are okay, but no where near as good as these songs. Most tracks are hits, but their's a few misses."
4,Great for the listener that appreciates lyrics.,"Nas has tight delivery on this CD. I really liked the cut featuring Mobb Deep as well. "" Black Girl Lost"" is a song that every young female should listen to."
2,Less than decent,"Message is really good track, but rest, let me set it straight, sucks! It's VERY decent work, and front cover is terrible (aarrgh!!)."
3,"Thought that the strings didn't work, but they do!","We thought our's didn't work either. Here's the trick...DON'T STRUM them! Instead, you should kind of pull up on them after pressing the ""one note"" button on the main part of the guitar."
4,Our guitar is 3yrs old and still going strong!,"My daughter got this for Christmas 3 years ago. It works exactly as advertised. If anyone is expecting a real guitar then no, this is not for you. This guitar plays Disney music, lights up, and is entertaining for little ones. On the right setting the songs will play when the child strums the strings if I remember correctly. My daughter is starting to out grow it, but still picks it up occasionally. If your kid still has an imagination, loves the disney princesses, then this guitar will be a hit."
4,Pleasent,"Delivery was quick .. one point I would like to mentioned is, I saw a nice purple color on the amazon but after the delivery of the actual product, the color was more light which was first kind of disappointed me .. but it had good lusture and nice uniform shaped. I presented to my mother in law and she just loved it. thanks. I recommend this product"
4,Danger on Deception Island,This game is really fun with the stuff you do. but the game overall was 4 stars because of the people. I thought they had no personality. That was the only thing I didn't like about this game. But overall it is a good game to play. So go buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,not up there on my list of ND games,"I do love the ND games. Deception Island just didn't make it to my top 7. I thought it was because the further back I went, the games just didn't seem as good because of technology or whatever. But, I noticed, this game is #9 and Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is #7. I liked Ghost Dogs. When you think of how many games are in the Nancy Drew series (19 now and one being released in July), there's bound to be a few that are not up to par with the others."
1,Nice game...UNTIL IT SHUTS DOWN YOUR WHOLE FREAK'N SOUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,Do NOT buy I repeat DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This game is very fun AND my mom dosen't even understand it...Other problem...IT SHUTS DOWN MY COMPUTERS SOUND!!!!!!!!!I had to take the file and UN-LOAD IT.AKA DELETE DELETE DELETE DELETE.WWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSTTTTTTTT OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYY
4,Danger On Deception Island,"I have played all the Nancy Drew computer games except for the first one, and this one has to be one of my favorites. I love marine biology and marine wildlife, so I was happy that you got to not only solve a mystery but play little mini games and learn about marine life as well. The lighthouse was spooky and all the characters had a reason to be the suspect. In the end, it was not who I thought it was going to be. The only bad thing about this game is that it's a little shorter than the other ones, but it's still worth buying."
5,earplugs for granddaughter,i was very pleased with your product my granddaughter just had tubes in her ears and they work very well. thank you
5,Garlic Lovers Must Have Cookbook,I've cooked with garlic all my life but never knew there were so many other delicious ways to cook and use garlic. Love this book and highly recommend for the beginner as well as a seasoned cook. The recipes are from all over the world and photos alone are enough to motivate you to create these unforgettable crowd pleasures.
3,Not very good,"I expected a better book from a band who has millions of dollars to pay a professional editor and researchers. From the interviews I see that excepting Keith, they didnt help much. I wish the Stones would come back with a GREAT last album and then say goodbye. I dont like how cynically they have reduced everything to multi millionaire business."
2,"Needs new material, not the same old, same old","Kabbalistic Handbook for the Practicing MagicianJoseph Lisiewski 2005New Falcon Press192 pages.I was really disappointed with this book. It had several chapters with good material, but the main problem was that over half of the book was already written, in his previous book on the Kabbalah. Chapters three through six were strikingly familiar because it was the same material, written verbatim. I felt cheated out of what I hoped was going to be an excellent book. If he'd had briefly covered the material and then moved onto new material that would be one thing, but he didn't do that.His last chapter offers some good resources, especially on the alchemical correspondences. Some of his book references were also useful ,and I feel he developed a much better explanation for his dislike of what he considers new age magic, but I'd have really liked to have seen a lot more new material.2 stars out of 5."
3,Back to mediocrity,"Cliff's resurgence was fading when this album was released. Buy any of the other recently re-mastered, reissued albums before this. This album seems silly and awkward. Choose ""I'm Nearly Famous"" or ""Rock and Roll Juvenile"" (both great albums) before this. Even ""I'm No Hero"" is superior to this one. ""Wired for Sound"" certainly marks a downturn in Cliff's career that he really didn't climb out of until ""Real As I Wanna Be"" (buy that one too!) Here's hoping the November 2001 release ""Wanted"" will be good . . ."
1,Venus Automatic Wine Opener - A BUST!,"I would NOT recommend the Venus Automatic Wine Opener.The 1st time I used this Opener, the cork didn't come out of the bottle.The 2nd time I used this Opener, the cork came out of the bottle and wouldn't come out of the Wine Opener.Consequently, there will be no 3rd time.In the time it took to remove the cork, I could have manually opened 3 bottles.And now that I'm trying to return it, I can't find the email address of the vendor!"
3,Kids and wife love it...,"Though one of them is currently missing, last seen somewhere around the middle.You'd think for 32 grand it would have some sort of surveillance system as well. Definitely lacking in that regard.Hopefully we find my son soon."
4,Love Triangle Thriller,"Tangled is a smart and edgy thriller with a talented young cast.A college student, David (Shawn Hatosy),wakes in a hospital bed to tries to recall the events leading to his severe injuries to a detective (Lorraine Bracco) who is investigating the disappearance of David's girlfriend Jenny (Rachael Leigh Cook). David's tells his story is told in flashbacks.When Estranged best friends david and Alan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers)meet again they end up fighting for the affections of david's crush jenny. The mysterious Alan wins her heart but soon his love for jenny becomes a obsession David must help her threw Alan's dangerous behavior but still also still tries to help Alan. But than things goes terribly wrong.This movie is exciting hip,edgy,sexy thriller you get sucked into the plot as the truth is revealed you see the truth behind the obsession.I give this **** four Stars"
2,Tangled movie,"Rachael Leigh Cook stars and looks amazing in this disappointing movie.Rachael Leigh Cook's character is torn between her male best friend who has feelings for her, and her boyfriend who is slightly off the rails. We begin with the best friend in hospital and he is being questioned by a detective played by Lorraine Bracco. Via the bestfriend's flashbacks which may or may not be true, the detective has to piece together what happened between the girl, the best friend and the boyfriend.The quality of filming isn't too bad in itself but there just isn't enough substance to the story. I suggest you buy ""Tangled"" if you are a Rachael Leigh Cook fan, but if not, you're not gonna exactly be heartbroken if you don't have this on your DVD shelf.I'm not saying it's terrible- it just could have been so much better."
5,Striking Thoughts,"This book was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be perfect to dip into for quick bursts of inspiration. This book is a collection of his various quotes and small writings that highlight his ideas and philosophy. It isn't necessarily a martial arts book (although this is touched upon), but a book about living your life in general. Although many of these ideas are not originally Bruce's, he was obviously moved by them and he does manage to represent them in a style of his own and in an accessible way. This has some great ideas whether you're a follower of Bruce's films or martial path or not.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,No es lo mismo!,"Definitivamente los años no vienen solos, me arrepiento de haber comprado este DVD, no son ni sombra de lo que eran, se les ve en el escenario muy debiles, como aburridos. Los salva la batería que si está tocada con la energía de siempre, pero la banda definitivamente regresó pero para mal. Hubiera comprado mas bien los videos originales de los 80's."
2,Same old same old,"Kevin Dubrow and Frankie Banali worked hard and hung in there to eventually produce what is now known as Quiet Riot. With the birth of MTV the band's Metal Health record shot to the top. It was a short lived fame because as the truth be known the band was not full of depth or talent. Yes, they worked hard but once at the top they did not have the ability to sustain it.Kevin and Frankie strike me as spoiled from the fame they briefly tasted. Carlos and Rudy are more down to earth. But whatever they may be their time in the spotlight has passed and now they are increasingly viewed as a fading footnote in the history of rock n roll."
3,"Strong, but not Herculean","The first half of the book is a good strong INTRODUCTIOn to the issues of user interface design. Well written, easy-to-read and follow, a good resource for someone with beginner to intermediate level understanding of interface design.The second half of the book? ho-hum."
3,For the basics...read this book,"This book discusses the design process overall and also briefly touches on usability tests and web surveys. More valuable is the second half of the book which breaks down different types of navigation systems (for Identity, Education, Shopping sites) and has some helpful hints as to what questions to ask accoding to which you are designing. Overall, a very ""basics"" kind of book. Many of the web examples she sites are no longer working links--good thing the book comes with a cd."
3,Quick Read With Fairly Good Information,"I have finished reading this book and taken from it some fairly good as well as new information. I must say that it is semi-basic, but at the same time very good for web designers. This book gives very specific examples on what to do on cut-and-dry category sites. The information and tips are very good, but the only problem is that no site fits into these categories perfeclty. If you are able to take what is important and combine it with information from other chapters, then this book will work for you."
4,A good in between,"I am a recent Plum convert and definitley a huge fan. I was a little hesitant about the idea of in between books and the introduction of a more supernatural element into the very mundane world of Stephanie Plum but I was pleasantly surprised. It was a nice little break from Stephanie's usual conflicts, including the love triangle though we do get to see Joe and hear about the triangle. I look forward to more between the numbers novels and more of Diesel. Yum!"
3,What?,"I think it's great that Janet Evanovich decided to write a holiday novel. It was cute, I guess, but it was also pretty pointless. Thank God I'm an avid reader of the series because if I picked this one up before I read any of the other novels, I definitely would've given up on Janet Evanovich. If you're a Ranger/Morelli fan (like me), you'll be somewhat disappointed because Morelli doesn't have a huge part and Ranger isn't even there. Ah well, on to 'To the Nines'!"
2,Not my favorite,I have read all the Plum books and this one wasn't my favorite. I don't understand the Diesel character. I think Stephanie has enough confusion with Ranger and Morelli. Kind of dumb..
3,Short but Sweet :),"Despite what a lot of other Evanovich fans' reviews, I think this book was highly interesting! I may not be that old but I couldn't put the book down. My mom read it in one hour and we both thought it was a great book. It may not have been as good as some of her other books but it was still a funny, mysterious novel. And I'm looking forward to her next GREAT novel!Don't worry Ms. Evanovich...I got your back!"
2,Quickie Christmas Novel,"Janet has joined the ranks of the Holiday Story Writers. This is a very short Holiday Novel that follows the adventures of Stephanie Plum. I've read Evanovich's numbered series and enjoy them very much but this one which included some of her continuing characters, a few new ones and the usual humor, just wasn't up to her usual standards. I could see this novel selling in Paper back as a quick amusing read, but the ... price tag was high for this one that is a one night read."
1,Don't waste your time!,I read this book for my book club and we all agreed-it was really bad. I really can't believe that I wasted the time reading this book. I found it to have absolutely no redeeming positives at all.
3,Should have been a $4.99 paperback,This book would have been ok for a $4.99 paperback but should never have been a hardback. I will be more careful next time. I did not even look at it before I bought it because I buy all books by this auther. I think she is great. This is a cute holiday story but not worth hardback price.
2,Should have waited for the paperback!,I can't believe this book was published in hardcover! I normally LOVE the Plum series. This was just a bit too out there for me. Hopefully the next book will be worthy of reading. This one I'd advise you to pass by.
3,Sugar Plumbs,A bit silly and over the top but who cares? It is still a Stephanie Plum and still a lot of fun.
3,A little nip o'Evanovich,"I bought this book because I love Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, and I'm waiting for Eleven on Top to come for me under the tree. I didn't expect a full-fledged Plum novel, and this definitely wasn't one - but it was good fun anyway! No, the plot lines aren't very surprising, intricate, or suspenseful compared to the usual Plum novels. Visions of Sugar Plums is not a literary meal, it's just an enjoyable, silly bite to tide you over. But if you want to spend a little bit of time (this book is quite short) getting into the holiday spirit with some of your favorite characters from the Plum series, and if you want to laugh out loud at least a few times, then buy this fun little bon-bon of a book. Otherwise, save your money for the next Plum installment."
2,XMEN or a Plum novel ??,"I was actually very dissapointed by this book. Evanovich is an amazing fiction/comedy writer...Sci/Fi...lets be honest..she is not. Im sure this was meant to be a break from the mold...a treat to her readers...but it left me sitting there giving one of Stephanie's famed ""eye rolls"". It felt rushed, and it just wasnt a good story...yes some laughs were there...but too short of a story, To XMEN like (maybe she had just watched the movie). I have loved all of her other books, and thought they were well written and maybe thats why I felt that this one fell short."
2,Visions of Sugar Plums,"Not the usual Evanovich quality. Too much fantasy. No enough of Granny. Too, too, too short."
3,Sugar Plums review,"The book itself was not the greatest quality, but for the price it was a steal. It was delivered within a reasonable amount of time."
2,Highly disappointing,As an avid Stephanie Plum fan since the publication of book one I was eagerly awaiting the publication of this book. I snatched it off the shelf the day it came out and read it that night. Highly disappointed is an understatement. This book fell far below the standards that one has come to expect of Stephanie Plum. The premise for the book was stupid and all the supernatural balony left one feeling cheated and used by the author. It did not belong in a Plum novel. This is an example of the author trading on the good name of her favorite heroine in order to make sales.
2,FAIRYTALES CAN BE BORING,"If you collect the Plum hardcovers, well you of course will want this.It is a Plum fairytale with not much substance. Stephanie goes to her parents house for Christmas, Stephanie wants a tree but has no time or motivation to get one, Stephanie see Joes for two seconds here and there, Stephanie has a supernatural friend who is a hunk but pretty boring (personally, I think Ranger is having a bad dream and this book was it)."
1,What happened?,I love the Stephanie Plum series enough that I suffered through this book. It was too improbable and unbelievable even for a Plum book. What happened Janet?Read it so you can keep the flow of the series but don't buy it. Check it out from the library.
1,disappointing,"This book was a waste of time and money, the last time I was this disappointed in a book was ""hannibal"". The plot was ridiculous, you know from the biginning that there are 4 days till xmas, steph is hunting a bail jumper only to let him go because it's xmas eve! this author could have done much better especially w/a xmas theme."
1,"Defective disc, not widescreen","I purchased this set for my wife for Christmas. We finally watched them and really enjoyed the series except that one of the discs is defective and simply won't play one chapter. In addition the package clearly says the discs are all ""widescreen"". None of the discs is presented in widescreen. Amazon will not accept a return on the disc set (without a 50% restocking fee plus shipping) because it was purchased before Christmas. They simply won't stand behind a defective product. I guess I didn't understand their returns policy in advance, but now that I do, I'll be looking elsewhere for my British mystery theater DVDs."
5,Great for British Spy and Crime Fans,"This was a gift to my daughter, one of the fans descibed in my headline. The Brits do this sort of thing really well. She has much enjoyed it, and I must thank the vendor for timely shipping and perfect condition."
5,George Gently - The Series - on DVD,"I am in love with British crime series and George Gently being one is no exception. I like the character's coolness. His sergeant, though, is a different story. Don't get me wrong, I like him too. He is funny with a very short fuse that his boss, Gently, deems to ignore, in most cases. Highly recommended."
3,Not a hit with the toddlers...,"I bought this cd due to the effusive praise of other reviewers, and, in fact, I like it. But partly for intellectual reasons-- hearings the music of other cultures is interesting to me at age 39. But it has struck out at getting kids to go to sleep, or even hold their interest. Maybe I tried it on the wrong kids, but my hunch is that kids are as likely to respond to U2 or James Taylor as they are to this. It's all music, and I still haven't deduced why some of it is targeted at children and some isn't (lyrical content aside)."
2,It sure ain't heroin!,It may sound like harsh judgement but there were only two songs that intrigued me and that I could see someone using on a film score. But as a whole it really is a pretty mediocre and forgetable CD. It actually serves its purpose though as it can put you to sleep as well as any other lullaby but I was hoping for something that would serve me better as background music as I sit at this PowerBook. Bottom line: It's OK but it sure ain't Heroin!
4,Byrd's Greatest Hits,"I finally got the correct CD for the Byrds. Be careful--somehow there has been a problem with the UPC code on this CD crossing over to a Sinead O'Connor CD. Verify with the seller that you are definitely getting the Byrd's Greatest Hits and you'll save yourself and the seller a headache. That said, most of the songs were great; only a couple I wasn't all that crazy about. Still a collection of songs reflecting the sometimes serious social issues of the '60's and others just humorous (Hey Mr. Spaceman) that you'll remember if you were a part of that era."
3,Another Great Ludlum Adventure,"Currently in paperback for only $7.99 is Robert Ludlum's The Prometheus Deception. Ludlum returns once again to what he does best, as the master of the spy-novel world. Nick Bryson has quit the spy world and has disappeared into anonymity, but fifteen years have passed and Bryson has now been called back into service. Recruited by the CIA, he is commissioned to watched the moves of the Directorate, originally an ultra-secret intelligence agency through which Bryson was trained. With terrorist conspiracy afoot, Bryson has his work cut out of him in Robert Ludlum's The Prometheus Deception.Originally published on May 13th 2002.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
3,Passes the Time,If you want to try this novel out I recommend listening to the abridged audio version. After reading through a number of previous reviews I realized that the person that abridged the book for the cd did a good job. A lot of the endless descriptions and inconsistencies have been removed. While there are still some glaring problems with the plot it's an exciting story with lots of action. I listened to it in the car and it made the time go much faster. Just go into it knowing this is a spy thriller and don't look at the plot too closely.
5,Awesome!!!,"Outstanding thriller and one of Ludlum's best! Action, drama, suspense, lost love, double crosses...all the trademarks of this master of international espionage."
3,Not up to his usual standard,"Having read all Mr Ludlum's books and thoroughly enjoyed all of them except the two ludicrous 'Road to', I must confess to a deep sense of disappointment in this one. When I start one of his novels I find it difficult to put it down, but this one I found difficult to pick up and finish. How our hero managed to survive the severe beatings and travel the world in a very short space of time defies me to understand. Sorry, Mr Ludlum, a very tired book from I suspect an author who does not have to be too concerned now as his books will sell whether good or bad."
1,The Prometheus Deception,"It is obvious this was written by a ghost writer. GARBAGE, save your money!"
4,A pretty good Ludlum book...,"This book was not bad, I finished it pretty fast for my standards and I really enjoyed it. There is some good action and enough surprises to make me say ""Ah!"" aloud whilst I read the book. The Prometheus Deception is perhaps not the best Ludlum book but I would still recommend it for a nice read."
2,Poor intro to Ludlum I suspect.,"I saw a trailer for the new ""Bourne Identity"" movie andcaught Ludlum's name up there. Never had him recommended tome, but I always knew his books were popular. Went to findBI and picked up ""Prometheus Deception"" instead.Pretty stupid book. Very, very tenuous connection to thePrometheus legend, writing was average, too many scene changesof dubious necessity and possbility, and the spycraft waslaughable. I'm supposed to be believe the best spy in theworld didn't know enough to check yesterday's weather beforepatching a video feed? And that a human can learn languages in a month, to a native level, but speaks horrific and incorrectPortuguese? (Maybe that's Ludlum's fault for trying to sneakPortuguese, Spanish, and local variants past a language student).This book rates as a nice diversion but sadly lacking. Itinspires one to sit down and write their own novel, as itproves that if Ludlum can get paid to write this, the moneyis out there for you, too."
4,"Another satisfying, complex page-turner.","MacDonald was still at the top of his game in 1973, with his titles regularly hitting the bestseller charts and earning him increasing recognition outside the detective novel field. Like most of his later novels, this is a complex, richly-detailed work based on intertwining family histories going back a couple of generations. Consistently suspenseful and occasionally profound -- a must for fans and a good start for anyone who's curious about MacDonald. [A Lew Archer novel."
1,Good Idea. Too bad it's junk.,"After returning two similar iGo adapters (which didn't work even just out of the box), I was initially pleased when the Belkin unit did work, most of the time. Ahh, that satisfaction was short-lived.It started acting flakey after just a few weeks, and has now failed entirely. Hard to say what the problem is, but it appears to be the connection to the main A/C plug.Now it's just an expensive paperweight that never comes on."
5,Product works fine with Excellent service from Belkin,I bought this around 8 months back as I had to make frequent work trips to Irvine and I needed an adapter that could work with a couple of different brand portables. This set served the purpose well and has worked well over this time. Very sturdy makeup and works fine for long hours. Once I had a small issue and had to call Belkin an dtheir support was excellent. Within 3-4 days they sent one of the tips that I has lost. Will buy again the Belkin products.
3,What's the big deal?,"While every song is a true oldies hit, these are songs easily found on just about any oldies collections, even more so on the WCBS-FM oldies cd's. This is no big deal to true oldies collectors."
2,this isn't what i ordered,"i don't know if it's the seller or what but i got a cord, with no box or seller's packaging, and yeah, not good. hopefully you will get one that's actually new."
5,This is a must read for all Star Wars fans.,"This book will keep you glued to your seat with all of the adventures that Jacen and Jaina get into while on ""vacation"" on Cloud City."
5,Very insightful views on what really happened in WWII,"I had never read any books by this presidential candidate, but his views on our role and Europe's role during WWII are very insightful. I think that after reading this book you'll wonder why the media is calling him anti-semitic for his views on WWII, because I did't read anything within the book that gave me even the slightest impression that he was anti-semetic."
1,Probably makes more sense in the original German.,"In his extensive justification for his isolationist policies, Buchanan attempts to make the case that leaving Germany to its own devices (i.e., invading Poland and the Sudetenland and oh yeah, killing Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, trade unionists... not to mention the occasional Catholic priest who protested) would have somehow prevented World War II. This is the sum of his message; since that's not enough to give him enough pages to make up a whole book, he has to pad his message with assorted anti-Semitisms and xenophobia galore. This book reads like nothing more than a ""Mein Kampf"" for the next generation."
1,Scary,"While I agree with Pat Buchannan that the differences between the two major parties seem to be decreasing by the second, his thoughts about World War II are downright frightening."
2,Politically Correct Right Wing,"THis is an addendum to my previously submitted review. Pat B., and all you other reviewers, who question Somalia, etc., and our soldiers being there (I did not agree with being there, too), but ..wow... Pat B. really touted our invasion of Grenada, where we lost 18 troopers, and as a young trooper being there, it was not a happy scene. Pat B is very selective with his ""isolationism"", and seems to believe that his views of ""America First"" is the one and only strict definition that is conservative. Bull ca-ca."
5,Brilliant manifesto for a new conservative foreign policy,"I loved this book. It's a great manifesto for a new foreign policy; a common ground that Americans of Left, Right and Center can stand on. Making the case for a sovereign foreign policy that avoids unnecesary foreign entanglements and wars, Pat puts America First, Second and Third!"
1,more non-sensical gibberish from conservative pundit,"So the British are responsible for the Holocaust because they didn't meet their obligation to protect the Poles, and that's why the U.S. should not intervene in foreign conflicts? Come again?"
1,Buchanan is intellectually bankrupt,"Isolationism is an intellectually bankrupt basis for building a foreign policy. Not only is it foolish, it is impossible in the context of our global economy. His views on WWII are laughable. Anyone who votes for Buchanan is voting for stagnation and bigotry."
5,Superb!!!,"This Christmas album is in the same category as John Berrys' 'O Holy Night'. Top rate. Yess the usual favourites are here and done in the style only Collin Raye can do. Such a distintive style. As an added plus, an instrumental version of 'The First Noel' is included which adds a nice touch."
5,great Christmas album.,"If you like Collin Raye, then you will like this. Some traditional but my favorite song is track # 3 ""It Could Happen Again"" I have had this CD before but that song got scratched so I replaced it. Worth every penny!"
1,Awful...,"This system is total junk. Yes, it plays your CDs and burned CDs but what is horrible about this is the depth of the sound. It has no bass production whatsoever, and no hitting Mega Bass won't help.Trust me and do not waste your money."
3,A little disappointed,"This product is advertised as all metal. I was disappointed when I received mine to discover that the plunger inside the tube, which take all the pressure of pressing cookie dough, is plastic. With every other cookie press I have had, this essintial part is usually the first part to break. But, I'll try it and see what happens."
2,Not worth the money,Use this product for a while and feel the pain in your fingers and wrist. I would not recommend it for anyone.
3,It's Pretty Good,"But it has a problem with the top popping off. Other than that, It's pretty sturdy and easy to clean."
1,Cookie press,"I would not recommend to anyone!The top of rim was bent , making it impossible to screw lid on."
5,Gorgeous Illustrations,"My 2 year old loves hearing this story and I love staring and the rich illustrations. This is, by far, the most beautifully illustrated book I've encountered so far. ...shopping for other Mike Wimmer-illustrated books so I can buy them all."
4,Nice but a little flimsy,"This is not a baking mold, it is a cake setting ring.It is a great idea to have just one ring, instead of having ten ring of different sizes.Great height for layered cakes. You can adjust it to the desired width. The only problem is that it is a little flimsy, so when I am using it, I am afraid I might bend it. I have used it only once and it worked well. I will keep on using it.I took it to my baking class and showed it to my chef, she thought it was cool, but we're used to use the hard metal non-adjustable ones."
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed with this film. There was no chemistry between the two leads at all. The best friend was the most engaging element of this movie.Rent if you must but do not purchase as I did.
3,great christmas song compilation,"This cd has all the great ones, from The Grinch to Charlie Brown Christmas. Timeless classics that will always be a part of my christmas."
3,A Cute and Amusing Read,"Reading about Miss Julia is a lot like spending time with someone's quirky grandmother. If you like Mitford, you have to try this series, they aren't as warm and fuzzy, but they are very enjoyable none the less."
4,A hoot!,"If you're from the South, you will totally enjoy reading ""Miss Julia"" takes over. Miss Julia is a proper Southern lady who is finding she's capable of handling much more than she ever dreamed she could. Every Southerner has a great aunt or a grandmother just like Miss Julia -- she epitomizes the ""Steel Magnolia"". The other characters in the book are just as delightful and believable. I also particularly enjoyed the book's dry humor."
2,Miss Julia Takes Over,"First 2 pages and last (don't know how many) pages were missing! This is a series of books, so I didn't know what happened in the beginning or how it ended."
1,No stars sounds best,Another pig here. Believes that children should be whipped and the parents are LAW... I wish I could really describe this evil Fulgate author. How rude of him to even encourage the whipping of special needs children!
1,Trash,"This book is nothing but techniques on how to hurt your children. If you actually love your children, you will stay far away from it. It should not even be legal with the abuse that is recommended in it. Other stores have already stopped selling it because of its violent nature. I would recommend a book that teaches how to raise children, not how to hurt them. You don't need instruction on how to hit a child anyway, but that is all this book teaches. There is nothing in this book that teaches someone how to be a real parent. It only teaches how to be just another child that hits and fights and throws temper tantrums."
1,Why does Amazon stock this book that promotes beating children?,"Sickening, vile, incredible. An insult to true Christians and an outrage to loving parents. Please register your revulsion and ask Amazon how they can justify stocking this child abuse manual."
1,Not God's Word But Man's Abuse,"Hitting children is not the word of God but the mis-interpretation by misinformed people. I can't imagine the disappointment God feels each time someone hits and/or abuses a child and then tells them it is God's love when it is most definately not. Discipline and correction are teaching, violence is not."
1,BEATING UP BABIES,"This book is SO SICK!!!! They call babies the worst names, this is not Christian to call people filty names! And it's not Christian to beat up babies and children and adults with wooden sticks, you don't even beat up your pets that way do you? Please don't do the things this book says to do! You will ruin your child's life and YOU might end up in JAIL!!!"
5,What the Bible Says About Child Training (2nd Edition),"This book is very concise and easy to read. The author clearly explains corporal punishment and biblical training with such clarity. Many people are fearful of spanking because they do not understand how or when to spank correctly. After reading this book I feel more confident in my parenting skills knowing that I am training my child to become a great godly citizen one day. It is better to set the foundation earlier than later and this book will show you how! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a lot of scriptures to back up their discipline plan used in their home. Also, if you are unsure of spanking or do not want to spank, than this book is a good read to help you get a better understanding of what corporal punishment is and what it is not. Also, the author offers lots of other great discipline tools as well...overall, this is a great book!"
1,STAY AWAY,"This is an absolutely horrible book. I know so many kids, me included, that were rarely if ever spanked and have done quite well.The basic idea of this book is that you have to break your child by beating him into submission. Only then will he come under perental authority, which fugate sees as godly authority. It is a horrible notion that you have to break a child's spirit before they will do the ""right thing.""How can a child ever learn anything but ""Might=Right,"" using these methods? How can he or she ever make a truely moral decision about anything when it is all fear-based.In short, I wouldn't use this book if I were TAKING F---ING SHROOMS."
1,Child Abuse,This book aptly illustrates the heights of depravity that Christianity can achieve; it amounts to nothing more than an instruction manual for some of the most perverse child abuse I have encountered. People who utilise this material do not deserve the honour of parenthood.
1,This cable is horrible,I bought this cable from circuit city cause I was in desperate need for an svideo cable to use on my kv-27fv310 sony wega tv. It looked horrible... When you play Metroid Prime you can easily see dots crawling on the red nintendo logo at the start of the game similar to the ones you see when you use the standard av cables the Gamecube comes with. Throughout the whole game there's crawling dots (especially on alot of blue colored objects like ice) which made me very dissapointed... Later on I bought the component video cable from nintendo's online store for about 35 bucks with shipping and that cable delivers amazing quality. I highly recommend the component cable from nintendo. The Intec S-Video cable is still better than the standard av cables though but as far as s-video goes this cable is horrible (had the same experience with an interact s-video cable for playstation until I bought the official sony one which was way better). Not recommended.
3,Make sure it fits your gun,My nailgun is from the same manufacturer (BT200K) and doesn't have a slot in the loader that fits this size (also doesn't fit 1-5/8 nails). Other reviewer of the same gun have used anyway with good results but I don't like forcing things this way.
2,Captivating by Stasi & John Eldredge,The journal questions are redundant and most people in the group I'm leading don't like it.
2,"I had heard so much good, and it was really really bad","My cousin recommended this book to me, and I just felt it was a repeat of so much other self help stuff that is currently out there. Don't get this book... the publisher must be paying their marketing people big bucks to be promoting this cr*p."
5,Helpful for Thoughts,"I love this companion journal! The book is so dense with information, this journal provided a great place to take notes and sort through thoughts and emotions.Get ready to do A LOT of writing!"
3,"Good, not Great","I used this journal in addition to the book to lead a Bible Study over the summer. I loved the book - it had some great stuff in it, but the journal was not exactly what we needed for a group discussion. It's more geared to individual use, but it worked ok going through and picking out the questions that were good group questions."
3,Ordered by Mistake,I ordered the journal by mistake and have not really looked at it. I turned around and ordered the book that I had intended.
5,Phule's Company will have you giggling throughout....,"This is the beginning of Robert Asprin's funniest series to date. He's managed to create characters that are likeable as well as realistic enough that you can genuinely care about them.The story is set in a technologically advanced society, but it's not so complex as to alienate you. Willard Phule, the main character, is an interesting guy to read about. Being one of the youngest megamillionaires in the galaxy, you wouldn't think he'd join the military. But he does... and not just any branch, but the Space Corps--the laughingstock of the military. The antics will have you hitting the floor on several occasions, I'm telling you.Believe me, by the time you finish the book--which won't be long--you won't rest until you find the sequel. Have at it"
4,specific views,"In looking at a great deal of prophecy oriented material, I found R. Woodrow a very knowledgeable and likable author and his discussion are very specific to a topic and not far ranging. His writing style is great to me. The info is short sweet and seems to be very accurate."
5,The Collector,Good read but a little repetative towards the end of the book. Crazy to think this kind of stuff actually happens.
1,tabloid journalism,"This reminded me of something I might read at the grocery store. Great for people who know nothing about science and very persuasive.The scientists are portrayed as pawns to other scientists, politics or their own egos. The imprecise nature of volcanology is glossed over too easily.Read SURVIVING GALERAS instead."
1,apparently all knowing,As an amateur geologist and full time scientist I was very disappointed in this book. The science of volcanology is very imprecise and there are many unknowns. The author seems to feel that the scientists on Galeras should have known the eruption was imminent. The very nature of our knowledge of volcanology is that we don't know when eruptions will happen. Has the author ever been to an active volcano? To people with only superficial knowledge this book may seem to be very authoratative but I found the omniscient attitude very unscientific.
3,Appeals to a narrow audience,"I love to learn about volcanoes, and the reviews about the controversy over whose book was most accurate on this particular disaster intrigued me. It's a fairly easy read and gave a fair account of the events at Glaeras and Nevado del Ruiz. However, learning that the ability to predict volcanic eruptions is only a very recent discovery surprised me, and made me appreciate the work being done at volcanic observatories around the world. I did have a problem keeping track of the various people in the book and learning enough about them to care about them as much as the author apparently did."
2,I was disappointed with this cd,"I was disapointed with this cd. The title,to me,promised some tangible way to connect better with your center. I thought the meditations were ""trite"" and not too effective. I learned one good breathing exercise on the cd or I would have rated it a one star."
1,not even Crabbe on the cover!,"I'll leave the discussion of the film to other reviewers, but let me point out that the DVD cover pictured isn't even Buster Crabbe in Tarzan the Fearless 1933. It's Gordon Scott as Tarzan from Tarzan's Greatest Adventure 1959! What does this say about the people putting out this product--forewarned is forearmed!"
5,Bev's,"Michael and his father J.T. are such great writers. I love that the focus with the Cherokee's, and most Native Americans, is balance and harmony and helps you to create peace in your life if thats what you want."
5,Excelent book!,"This clearly written concise book teaches the use of a select subset of herbs. This material is accurate as far as I can tell based on my limited experience with herbs over the years.This book also teaches the properties of the various totem animals. This book helped me to take the indian name of Two Bears October 1999. I only now remembered to review this book. ;-)The subtitle of this book ""The Way of Right Relationship"" means that everything in existence is a manifestation of the Great Spirit, and should be treated with respect. Basic Amerindian philosophy.Learning a few Cherokee words will not hurt either. ;-)I am proud to say that my watai (personal stone) is in my pocket, but I had collected rocks for about 40 years anyway. ;-)A sincere wah doh (thank you) to the authors."
1,"Convoluted plot and unpleasant, cartoonish characters","None of the characters in this book talk or behave like real people. The two main characters -- Ewan and Cyd -- are completely unlikeable. Every conversation turns shrill. I think it was supposed to be witty banter, but it isn't. I kept hoping they'd just kill each other and put the three of us (them and me) out of our misery. Evil Aunt Angela might as well be wearing a witches cape and passing out poison apples -- that's how subtle this is. Then there's the plot. I won't go into detail other than to say, give me a break. The nonsensical, purely-for-melodrama twists and turns gave me a headache. Anyone with good taste in books needs to avoid this novel."
1,Very Forgetable,"I see I'm discovering this book a few years later, but it hasn't changed. I get 99% of my books from the library so I don't feel like I wasted money on a dud. Just time waiting for it to get better.Talk about beating a dead horse - I get the message already. Cyd wants the boat shop, why she thinks she's entitled to it beats me, she has nightmares every night, she's afraid of the dark, lots of locks in her home but who has the code and a pass key? Hmmmmm.Ewan is going to find the truth about his parents disappearance, Aunt Angela is a witch, Uncle Fred is a wimp and so on and on and on.What drivel"
4,Birth of a Princess,"This was a Christmas gift for our 3-year-old granddaughter. She wanted to try it on immediately. When my wife helped her into it and she saw herself in the mirror, my wife remarked that our granddaughter had a transformational experience, truly believing that she had become a princess and, at the same time, unable to believe that she was so lucky."
1,DON'T BUY !!!! PETALS FALL OFF AND BREAK,"I purchased this toy for my 3yr old twin girls and it was such a disappointment. The loved the music that would play on the keyboard, however as soon as one of the girls went to place it down on the floor two of the petal fell off. I was able to place the two petals back. However than I was trying to show them the different features the keyboard could do and I made some to the petals fall off. That wasn't the biggest problem. One of my daughters dropped the keyboard on the floor and not only did the petals fall off and break, but the plastic cover came off the flowers exposing the metal underneath. This I was unable to snap back on.. This product is not worth the money and not good for little toddlers. This toy was a only kept in my house for a month and than I trashed it!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS WAS A DISNEY PRODUCT THAT WAS SO POORLY MADE."
1,It (...) muchos!,"I liked the first two and the last movie but this blows. I mean, the acting is (...) ad it goes against parts one and two in that now the movie becomes self-aware.My sister owns a leo dicraprio annual which declares mr. dicraprio's hate for this movie(hey we agree!)But then i thought, if i were in a (...) movie, i'd show everyone i was better than it by acting well!But he didn't. (...)Brodie(...)"
3,Man-eating hairballs have a bite like a shredding-machine.,"Critters 3 is mostly about these man-eating hairballs that come and attack at a L.A. apartment. It is up to the bounty hunters to stop them, before they stop them. Starring Don Opper, with Leonardo Dicaprio. Critters may look cute, but their vicious little beasts. I liked this movis. I wouldn't say it was great, but it had a good cast to it."
1,I generally expect SNL movies to be lousy...,"...and this one didn't disappoint. Seriously, has there ever been a decent SNL movie? Why do I keep putting myself through this torture? The humor was brain-dead, the script was ill-conceived, and the acting was thoroughly unconvincing. Even the sight gags and physical humor fell flat. I'm so drained from sitting through this slop that I can't even summon the energy and wit needed to write a proper scathing review."
2,"Cheesy, but Entertaining","If you are a huge fan of Saturday night live and enjoyed ""A Night at the Roxbury"" this movie is perfect for you. For anyone that wants to watch a hilarious comedy, look elsewhere. I thought that several parts in the movie were ""amusing"" not hilarious! The movie is entertaining, but is a typical ha! ha! I have plenty of money and don't care what I watch, kind of movie. If you are bored and don't have high hopes, you will enjoy it. If your hopes are high............ be prepared to have them deflated."
2,Fairly bad,"Mary Katherine Gallagher is an uncomfortable, uncool, venemous Catholic schoolgirl who dreams about stardom and dating the school stud. This film does its part to uphold the proud tradition of (bad) movies derived from SNL material. Molly Shannon does great prat falls, but there is little else to recommend this bizarre, armpit-sniffing character. The plot is nothing and goes nowhere."
3,Funny but just okay,It is a funny movie but think of it as one long SNL sketch. Will Farrell and Molly Shannon are their usual great comedians.
3,Superstar,Good movie I actually was able to watch the whole thing. Will Ferrell is funny as is Molly Shannon although the underarm sniffing is disgusting.
3,Bearable..,"This movie about Mary (Molly S. from SNL) is kinda plain but it IS bearable..you can sit through it,if ya wanted. It's about Mary praying and dreaming of being a ""SuperStar!"" by dancing and just plain fitting in. She has a crush on the most-popular guy at school,Skye,who is popular for being the best dancer,which he clearly is not. Mary gets put in a 'Special' class where she meets her best friend. What i really liked about this was that Tom Green is in it and he acts the same as he does now. I would recommend this for a movie to watch when you are looking for a few slight laughs. If you like SNL,then you might like this."
5,IM NOT A SLUT,this movie was over the top outrageously funny. i love molly shannon she is one of the top comedians of our time. she can do anything and make it funny. it was so funny when she made out with the tree. i kknow like every quote from the movie i is crazy. it is funny how they make fun at a catholic school. you will not regret watching this movie love ya world.
1,Stupidstar,"You'll want to turn this movie off after ten minutes. It's pure garbage. It's never funny and just so stupid you feel like a dumber person for watching it. Just like the failing seasons of Saturday Night Live, you should avoid it at all costs."
1,BEWARE!,"Whatever you do, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! I can't believe I wasted my money on renting this trash! This film was nothing but an overlong version of the sketch. This is by far the worst SNL movie yet with terrible and cheesy acting. I saw this movie because I heard Tom Green was in it. However, he was only in it for about 45 seconds. To think that I wasted and hour and a half of my time on this garbage. Stay away from this film, I promise that you aren't missing much."
1,can't express my disgust in words,"uggggggggggggggh this has to be THE most disgusting movie ever made. I hated Molly Shanon, I hated the hero, I hated the dialogue and by the end I was ready to bang my head against the wall. had to watch a couple of my fav. ones like clueless and braveheart to wash away its nasty effects. I am really surprised at the film makers. WHAT IN GOD'S NAME WERE THEY THINKING OF!"
5,another season,"Seasons of My Heart arrived faster than fast. Or reuley take you on a journey thriugh Oaxaca, I love the cookbooks that give you background on the area(s) the food is from."
5,Great Adventure Game!,"I play adventure games with my children, and we LOVED this game! I am an old-time Zork fan, so I recognized much of the humor and some of the places, etc. This was fun, never too difficult to figure out, but always just challenging enough to keep us thinking. We would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good challenging adventure game."
3,safe but not comfy,"I bought this for our new baby girl, its pretty and safe, but, she hates it the straps never look right and she is so not comfy and hates being in it, this is our fourth child, and looks can be deceiving, my wife thinks higher priced is better, not in this case, I should have bought the britax infant we have their toddler and booster, they arent as fashionable, but, they were designed with kids in mind"
4,"The new, improved June 12 DVD","There is little to add beyond what others have already said, however, I have to wonder why the ""improved"" version still ISN'T WIDESCREEN?!Other than that, sensational movie, good sound and picture quality. Definitely on my list of scarriest movies of all time. Here, Kubrick shows he can give Hitchcock a run for his money, even if only once."
5,Brilliant,"This movie is my favourite movie ever, closely followed by Monty Pythons meaning of life. It is so amazingly eerie and haunting, with some truly terrifying scenes. The music adds to the haunting effect it gives. It keeps you awake for days Nicholson and Duvall are very good, with nicholson's performance being a classic of all time. Lloys is also very good for an actor of his age. (This is his only movie) I wont tell you the storyline as to wreck it for you if you have not already seen it. If you have read the book it is only loosely based on the book but believe me it does not detract from the movie.Hope this helps (rent it or buy it)A ClassicThanx"
3,The Shining,"It was okay for it's time but it didn't quite follow the book. However, there was another ""The Shining"" done for television and I wish they'd put that one on video."
3,Well....,"Well...the first time i saw it, I fell asleep. That's how scary it is. there are some scary scenes in it, like the two girls who suddenly appers in the hallway, and some of the scenes with JN. I mean, the actors are truly amazing ( that's why the movie get's three stars) But the movie really should have been more like the book. I think the 1997 version is better."
5,one of the finest,"A movie like we are used to from the main man kubrick. Great story, superb cast (especially the diabolic nicholson). Still watching the movie after all these years (i have em on tape) and i'm still enjoying the scene's like it's the first time i watch em.The bar scene is my favourite ( the conversation with the previous housekeeper) and the photo on the end with nicholson smiling really does the trick."
3,Good But Not A Horror Movie,"This movie is not a horror movie in my opinion. It was a good suspense movie and it had a good plot but it was not a horror movie. Jack Nicholson play's his part vary well as the evil killer. The rest of the cast also dose vary well. This movie is not something to watch with someone, to make the movie scarier watch it alone."
3,Good but not great,"I just bought a DVD player and made ""The Shining"" one of my first titles. While I am still very impressed by the vast improved picture and sound quality over VHS, I was a bit disappointed that it was in pan and scan format. This is the kind of movie that letterboxing was designed for. ""The Making of The Shining"" has some interesting highlights but one must wonder why Kubrick himself wasn't interviewed like Nicholsen and Shelley Duvall. I realize that he is a bit reclusive, but did appear on it so he obviously wasn't against being seen on camera."
1,Highly overrated,"This movie has a certain mystique about it, but for me, watching it was really a waste of time. It's not all that scary; it's just full of unnecessary gore and disturbing images. Not only is this movie morally bankrupt, it's also just not that entertaining. Skip this one."
1,Don't waste your time,"I would give this movie no stars. I read the book(which was excellent)and thought it would be fun to have a bunch of friends over to watch the movie. I sat there the entire time explaining what was going on. How can it be considered a good movie when people don't understand it? I'm perplexed at the choice of Shelly Duvall to play Wendy, and Jack Nicholson to play Jack. Neither one fits the character in the book. Kubrick should have stayed true to the story. Don't waste your time on this piece of cinematic crap. READ THE BOOK!"
3,Thrilling,"Kubricks the Shining isn't a very scary film, yes it's suspenseful but it won't make you jump out of your seat because it was so scary.The only scary factor in the movie is the character Jack Nicholson portrays, he looks crazy and scary.For anyone interested in watching the film, I recommend reading Stephen Kings novel first if you really want to get scared,and yo also get to picture the characters how you want. I think that's very fun."
4,Tom Mercers Review on the shining,"Another excellent classical horror film here by Stanley Kubrick. If you think the book is good then watch the film. Set at an isolated hotel set off the family where some years ago a previous caretaker slaughtered his family as he went crazy. The family is still at the hotel as they are ghosts. Through the film the ghosts appear to try and make Jack Nicholson slaughter his family too. Luckily the child has a physic force called the shining which enables him to contact others with this power through his mind, he calls the chef of the hotel but he soon is hacked down by nicholson, in the end they get away into the bush maze where Nicholson gets lost and freeezes. It is a very spooky and tense film which is superb in its television form and people worldwide know the famous saying from the film `HERES JOHNNY`"
5,The BEST Blu-Ray Disc I've seen yet,"I am shocked at how amazing this film looks in Blu-ray. I just bought a Blu-ray player and have been renting three discs a day since I bought it. Of all the discs I've watched (including recent titles) this film is the best. There isn't much more to say about it. If you're a fan of this film, or film in general, this disc is a must."
5,Jack for real!,"I have come to realize that some DVD revisions come and go and then it can become impossible to get them. So I wanted to get the best version of the Shining before its too late. I believe this movie is best in 4:3 so if you are an addict of this movie I would get this version. I actually now have all 3 versions. Amazon got me my copy quick and in good condition.The Shining is in my top 10 movies I like of all time. So that means I can rewatch it to an uncountable figure. I would not consider it a Horror movie by todays standards. I have my own genre I put it in. The ""Psycho"" genre. That means any movie that has a really good character playing a really good psycho killer. Jack is one of the best at this type of acting. So if you find yourself liking psycho movies then the Shining is a must have and I would say watch it at least once a month. Dr's Orders."
3,"Despite what ""Gene Siskel"" said - it *is* a pan & scan","Two problems with this release: 1. ""Gene Siskel"" (see below) perhaps forgot what the framing looked like in the theater. This DVD is most of the time a pan & scan of the matted area. Example: the Torrances driving to the Overlook Hotel. In the theater entire rear window of the car is visible (right edge). 2. Transfer quality is firmly ""average"". And another strange item: the closing credits are not the ones from theatrical print: they are white instead of blue, much larger, and appear on screen out of sync with the music. But for the price the DVD is great, mainly thanks to the ""Making 'The Shining'"" documentary. I wish it was longer."
2,What the hell?!,"Okay, so it's full screen, I can get over that. But what's with the awful video transfer? Warner's must have rushed it out to take advantage of Eyes Wide Shut's release and Kubrick's death. The snow and grain throughout the film is truly horrible for DVD. The reruns on the USA Network have about the same quality as this tranfer...Four stars for the movie itself, Two for the picture quality..."
4,again?,Yes!For those expecting Warner working at their best here is Johnny!!THIS movie is not the 144 min.It just got the old well known115 min.we all have seen.How the hell do you get the REAL long version?
5,Scariest Movie Ever,Awesome movie that freaks you out from start to finish. I read the book after seeing the movie and have to say that the movie is much scarier. The dead women in the bathroom scene is the most haunting. The final scene where Nicolson is chasing after the kid with an ax through the snowy maze is one of the most intense scenes ever. The awesome music creates half of the fright throughout the film. If you do not find this movie scary then I must ask you what would you call scary?
4,A classic ! But...,"The movie is perfect, the documentarie in fine, the trailer is really spooky, but the film is not in widescreen format. Warner Brothers should consider improuving their marketing trategies... This superb masterpiece should have a plastic case and all the options"
4,A Stanley Kubrick film,I own this movie. It has a behind the scenes documentary in the special edition. It is about an acholic who promised to take care of the overlook hotel in Colorado. He gets a case o cabin fever. He starts drinking. His son has a strange thing going on with him hearing voices. The best scene in the movie is with the killer Dell Grady(Philip Stone) and Nicholson. Director: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Shelley Duvall Jack Nicholson and Scatman Corrutthers
2,"Horrid Adaptation, Boring Horror","Throwing away the (far superior) novel by Stephen King, highly overrated director Kubrick fashions a sometimes creepy, usually cheesy horror flick. Nicholson does his best, but can't rise above the medicore script and direction. Grossly overrated junk avoidable by all but the people who worship anything Kubrick made, including sandwiches."
2,Dead wishes make for a dead movie,"The movie itself is brilliant, no one can take that away. It's good despite Shelley Duvall even, and man do I ever hate her (worst part of Time Bandits, IMHO).Where they screwed up was 1) poor video quality, they could have digitally enhanced it, 2) widescreen HELLO??? KUBRICK IS DEAD, GIVE US THE REAL THING 3) Mono sound??? get real! see #2.Don't waste your money on this edition and lobby Warner to release the real thing! (ditto Full Metal Jacket)"
4,A timeless thriller,The Shining is by far one of the freakiest films I have ever seen. It has such a creepy undertone throughout the entire film. There are so many parts that make you wonder what was going on in Stanley Kubric's head. In my opinion he made hotels one of the creepiest places on earth by making you wonder if the twins will appear at the end of a long dimly lit hallway.Just a terrific classic horror flick. If you are a true horror fan this one is a must see.
4,Still a Charmer,"Jack,Is Jack,Is Jack. And if you like or respect him and his acting see this one in Bluray.For the first time as a regular movie or with the enhancements this movie holds you to it's conclusion.It amazes me that I still can't believe how seamlessly the character changes and how we go along with him.My only complaint is that I did not realize how much of a woses whose Shely DuVal is. Her character was so anoyingly weak that it was hard to believe she had ANY spine to hold her upright.But this is a small annoyance. Probably Jack's best role alongside ""One Flew Over The Cooko's Nest"">"
3,"Sorry, people!","Looks like I'm going to ruin this movie's average 5-star rating by giving it only 3. Yeah, it's scary. Especially those creepy little girls: ""Come play with us, Danny. . ."" But there are too many problems. Why, exactly, did Jack go mad so quickly? And the cook--why did the movie even bother to include him? We see him receiving little Danny's terrifying psychic cries for help, flying cross-country, renting a snow-cat, driving it thirty miles across up an icy, treacherous mountain, entering the hotel--and getting axed in the back almost immediately. In the book, his character had a much more important role, and survived the attack to help the mother and son get out of the hotel. I'm no Stephen King fan, but this is one case where I thought the book was superior to the movie. Synopsis of review: it's a good scary movie, but doesn't deserve a perfect score."
5,"The newest, greatest Kubrick production that I've seen!","I think that ""The Shining"" is a truly thought-provoking movie. The images are TERRIBLY horrific, scripts + plots = perfection. Jack Nicholson is just brilliant and so is the rest of the cast. If you like Stanley Kubrick, order ""The Shining"" for yourself or for a friend. I was watching it on HBO On Demand. This is the very first time I have seen this movie. It's just great stuff!"
5,CLASSIC,"I'm woefully underqualified to review a master classic movie like this. I watched it for the first time in 2008, and it is not dated in the least. It managed to scare, thrill and keep me glued to the screen. Excellent story, characters, scenery, just about everything. A classic horror film."
1,UGH !!! TERRIBLE !!!,"I rented it 1 yr ago as a huge Stephen King fan I wanted to see it . It had very unattractive actors , bad acting I mean the whole movie is pointless."
1,this is the worst film ever!,do not ever wrent this movie it is the worst horror movie that I have ever seen
5,Nicholson at his best,"As opposed to my Exorcist review- this movie doesn't lose on rewatching- each time you can pick up cinematography choices, editing choices, nuances etc- brilliant"
1,WARNING!!! READ THIS FIRST!!!,"This controller [stinks]... It is nothing like the real Nintendo Controller and is a very cheap controller.First of all, the shape is horrible. It is a struggle to keep in your hand, and it dosn't ""fit"" into your hand like the real Nintendo one.Next, the buttons are too small and hard to reach.Don't come near this controller, no matter what the package looks like. This is not a controller, it is just a hugeWASTE OF MONEY!!!Buy the real deal, the Nintendo Controller made by Nintendo.THIS REALLY DESERVES A ZERO OR NEGATIVE NUMBER OF STARSDO NOT BUY THIS ...!!!"
1,waste of money!,I wish I would have looked into this controller before I bought it. Its horrible. I've already exchanged 2 of them. Unfortunately Toys R Us wont let me exchange it for the original nintendo controller so it looks like I'm stuck with it. I'll just keep exchanging it until they give in I guess. None of them have worked out of the box so far. ...
2,This 20 Something Whinefest - Not For Everyone,"I must say right off that I'm over 30...so perhaps ""I just don't get it"".That said...this film has done for me what all the sleeping aids in the world have failed to do. I rented it from Blockbuster and tried to watch it for 3 nights in row only to have the same thing happen...zzzz. This Big Chill Wannabe has some fantastic production values going for it as well as some (please note: NOT ALL) good acting to it's credit. But the screenplay is a whinefest that never really works it's way out of the ""Feel Sorry For Us"" mode. It's plunging the depths of young adulthood problems reveals only an old boot and some seaweed."
1,big chill minus the talent,"This unorigial snoozer will make you lose your taste for any more indy films about a group of young friends. Tired-out jokes, incredibly predictable storyline, cliched characters, and a Hootie-like soundtrack make this Big Chill rip-off a big drag."
5,Beautiful,This book will move you to tears! It is one of the most beautiful spiritual works ever written!
3,Book review,"Arrived on Kindle promptly. It is very helpful in learning to understand the development of the Oxford Movement and also is revealing of a brilliant, complicated man in his personal journey to spiritual security. It is not easy to read in 19th century prose, but very illuminating for a period and events that led to our modern Anglican church."
1,Bought toaster 10 years ago and it just went out.,"I bought this toaster over 10 years ago for my grandchildren and it just went out. They loved it and now being teenagers when it went out, they were kind of sad for old mickey.From the reviews the company that use to make it no longer does.It is a shame that folks who had purchased this toaster are having a short life span with it.Why do companies cut corners with products to save money makes no sense to me.10 years ago 5 stars, now I will keep my money in my pocket. Too expensive to take a chance."
4,Bumkins Superbib,"Works pretty well. I wish the pocket to catch food would stay a little more open, but overall a pretty good product for the price!"
5,Great bib!,"Colors and workmanship hold up to hand and machine wash, dries quickly, is comfortable. Pack up tiny, and waterproof material really works! My girl is tall, so by 18 months, I wish it was longer. Her little sister will use these 3 bibs, too."
5,best bib,"after trying a few cloth bibs on my 5 month old, i quickly realized that i needed a plastic one. I really like how it is lightweight material, yet sturdy enough that my son cannot pull it off. THe velcro strip is wide, so it can easily adjust to smaller necks, and will still fit as he grows. also, you can secure it at the side of his neck, rather than having to reach behind him to attach the bib, which is much easier.I like the variety of colors available, and glad I chose the blue fizz, as it looks very cute on my boy.Very easy to rinse and hang after each meal. It folds up nicely and fits into his diaper bag like othing when we need to eat out.Very pleased with the fuctionality and quality of this bib. Its a keeper."
5,Best Old School Breakdancing video ever made.,"Best Olds School video ever made. A definate must see for all breakers, taggers, and DJ's. Even if your good, bad, new, or old. A definate must for your B-Boy video library."
4,Soundtrack Songs,"This movie made me very nostalgic. Totally worth the trip down memory lane. I just wish the soundtracks had all the songs from the movie on it. Does anyone know the name or artist of the slow song playing in the background at the Roxy when Kenny (Guy Davis) and Tracy (Rae Dawn Chong) are slow dancing? I have been looking for that song for years, and it isn't on the soundtrack."
5,One of the best films ever,"This classic film may seem a bit odd at 1st, with it's swapping around with the timeline (i.e. it seems like they made the film and then reshuffled various sections round). But when you get used to that, you will find the film brilliant. It has a lot of diffrent little inter-combined stories in it, which makes it very good. The music forPulp Fiction is really good and the sound track is worth having as well. This film is exciting and keeps moving and dosn't have a boring moment. It has a brilliant start and leave's you with a mystery by the end (just like the Italien Job)Great film buy it is one of the best films ever."
3,"Brilliantly filmed, but contraversial criminal novella","There is no doubt that the composition and innovation of Pulp Fiction deserve highest praise. However, the film comes through as ultimately pointless, and the themes it deals with are not in any way new. Perhaps a little more depth would have helped balance the many frighteningly brutal scenes with their relevance."
5,Pulp Fiction's cult and classic,"If you haven't seen this, you haven't seen nothing yet. Tarantino's best. Great ensemble cast, some crazy twists and vintage script. Buy this; essential video."
2,Not good enough,"I saw the movie several times because it is better than ordinarymovies,but it is not great at all.The movie was very influencial in 1990's,but it is not enough that the movie is called a masterpiece. Only screenplay is good enough,but nothingelse. Tarantino does not have skill to complete a movie(So he can't be a master,auteur) He can't make intelligents to be involved in his movies emotionally. See what he wanted to show in the movie.""Fargo"",""Goodfellas"" are really good movies made in 1990's in this country. Feel the difference between those movies and ""Pulp fiction""""Pulp fiction"" is good(not great),though."
1,the roman colosseum in 20th century garb.,"It was comforting to read a few negative reviews of this vile film...I truly thought I was alone in my assessment of this moral mess...but what was most disturbing was the audience reaction. It was not possible to escape the imagery of the roman colosseum where human suffering was looked upon as an entertainment event. It was so disheartening. Yes, we can explain it in the ""only a movie"" terms..or ""don't you get a satire when you see one""..heh, I guess not. Young people really don't ""think"" about the trash they allow themselves to digest. Even my own daughters enjoyed the movie. Pulp fiction damed itself on every level, but most especially in terms of its shallowness. I had recently seen ""The Player(s)"" and was strongly reminded of the ridiculous ""group"" writing that it claimed is a hallmark of Hollywood motion pictures"
2,PULP FICTION,"The movie, of course is good, but the DVD that I purchased skipped chapters and froze on other chapters thus having to start the movie again, or stop and start at a different place in the movie. Very disappointed in the quality of the DVD."
5,SUUUUCH a great movie!,"If you haven't seen Pulp Fiction yet, something is seriously wrong with you. Seriously. This is probably one of the best movies ever made. Starring * John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, and Bruce Willis * to name a few. Quentin Tarantino, this is your best work. Almost everything you've done since this has been on the lame side... I'm starting to think you blew your entire load on one movie, and this was it. Great cast, great scenery, great cinematography, great plot, great great great movie. If you haven't seen it, buy it. If you own it, sleep with it. This movie kicks ass."
2,Quintin Tarrentino made a mistake here.,"I like Quintin Tarrention movies. However, this movie stunk. I hated the ending, and I did not understand the ending which basically killed the entire movie.I like to be entertained. I don't want to be thinking about what the movie is trying to potray. Because this movie has so much silly symbolism and scenes that relate to nothing, this movie is a major mistake.However, with a guy like Quintin Tarrentino, he made so many good movies, he deserves some margin of error, its just that Pulp Fiction is his ""error""."
3,Weird and Overrated,"I had heard so many great things about this movie, but I had never seen it. Frankly, the only thing great about it was my disappointment. The acting is clearly very good, but the story line was way too weird. I know the movie is supposed to be funny in a weird way, but I found nothing entertaining about it."
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE,John Travolta stooped so low in this trashy film. Yet another Hollywood attempt to glamorize the pop-drug culture.
5,Crazy and Fun,"I enjoy this movie on many levels, primarily because of Quentin Tarantino's dark, offbeat humor and the star power fueling the film. Christopher Walken is hilarious as the Vietnam Vet. Harvey Kietell is bad a$$ in this movie too. The storytelling is great, the acting is superb, and there is enough comedy and ultraviolence to make you want more when it's over. I love it."
2,Painfully overrated,"Fargo, The English Patient and Pulp Fiction; the three most painfully overrated films of the 90's. What a sad waste of some truly fine actors. Once was more than enough, thank you."
5,Fictional quality.,"One of the greatest movies of all time(I'm sure you got sick and tired of hearing this all the time!).Pros:*The dialogue is unbelievable.I think it's the best dialogue since GoodFellas.The dialogue's got everything:humor,intensity,wise cracks and everything you'd enjoy to hear and repeat all day long.*Reserructing the careers of Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta.Stellar performances.Samuel was hysterical.*Excellent(though a little confusing)direction.*The movie is virtually star-studded.*Surprisingly,Bruce Willis acted brilliantly.*Harvey Keitel's scenes were some of the best parts in the film.Is this guy a great actor or what?*A John Travolta dancing scene.Cons:*The movie's a little confusing.I've seen it about six times,and still haven't gathered the plot in one specific order.*Does anyone know what was in the briefcase?I still don't know.The bottomline:buy it immediately. Although the DVD isn't full of your usual extras,the movie itself is cool enough."
1,Everyone says it's a great movie!,"Can a carefully crafted film, with a lot of thought put behind it, still be a bad film? Yes. Pulp Fiction is a case in point. At the core of each story fragment is an emotional vacuum that gets glossed over by the clever use of filmmaking gimmickry, self-consciously devised cartoon violence and quirky writing and acting. Tarantino uses these devices to distract the viewer from the fact that his film is emotionally and spiritually pointless and hollow. Could that be the point? To be pointless? Perhaps so, but if being pointless and spiritually hollow is the aim of a film or any creative project, that's a sad commentary on the creator. For a similar effect I prefer to watch Warner Brothers cartoons. They are funnier, more inventive, more artistically satisfying, and there is no element of self-consiousness in the violence. In other words, when I see the violence in a good cartoon, I don't think ""Oh my God that's so funny."" I simply laugh. See the difference?"
5,''I shot Marvin in the face.'',"Pulp Fiction, the masterpiece, the classic. There's not much to say because I'm sure whoevers on this page knows all about ""Pulp Fiction"". They know it's about three stories that is one story, that it's about two hitmen, one a heroin addict, the other a would-be saint questioning his role to society, and the last, a boxer. That's all I'm going to say because half of the beauty is the anticipation and surprise but I assure you it all works out amazingly.Although, I think the story could've gone without Butch, but hey; that's just my opinion."
1,WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?,"WHAT KIND OF MORON MADE THIS MOVIE. WAS HE ON CRACK! THIS MOVIE DOESN't HAVE A PLOT, A STORYLINE, AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAPPEN IN SEQUENCE. THE END OF THE MOVIE WAS IN THE BEGINNING? WHAT? I SLEPT THROUGH HALF THE MOVIE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE LIKE THIS MOVIE."
1,Missing Booklet From Set. Lame!,"I love this film, hence I purchased this 2-disc set. Too bad when I went to open the shrink wrap (a few days after my return edibility expired, by the way) it was missing the booklet that's supposed to come inside. Buyer beware. I bought this for the booklet and extras; if I would have know that Amazon ships out sloppily package merchandise, I would have just ripped the movie for free form the library. Lame."
1,unreadable disc,"watching pulp fiction with my girlfriend, who had never seen it (the horror!) when the screen goes blank with a message: disc unreadable. i took it out and cleaned it, tried again, and the same thing happened. exact same place, right after butch gets into the taxi (i'm an american, honey. our names don't mean shit) really shitty. went to family video and rented it, in hopes of finishing this cinema masterpiece, but this one stops in the middle of the last scene, same problem. unbelievable. fortunately with some cleaning this (rented) disc worked. that said, i am planning on getting a replacement, or at least my money back."
2,Too many swearings give me a headache,I got a headache after watching this because of the swearing by many actors from the beginning till the end. The acting is lively. It's worth watching once
1,Way too offbeat!,"This movie had poor taste. I didn't like how it tried to be too original. I want a movie I can read from cover to cover. This one jumped around all over the place. It wasn't funny, no suspense, lack of action, didn't flow, dark film. This movie shouldn't have been made."
4,99% perfect,"I loved everything about this movie...except I felt it was too long.Other than that,there is nothing wrong with it.Quentin Tarantino has such a unique style.You don't even have to understand the movie to like it.I had to watch it 2 or 3 times to really understand it.I haven't met anybody who didn't like this movie."
5,Filmed in a different way ......,"This movie isn't shown in chronological order. I've noticed that this tends to confuse the feeble minded viewers. But they must understand that the movie focuses more on the individuals and their stories. So shooting out of sequence is necessary to give each story its own individual attention. It worked really well in my opinion.This movie is also loaded with stars. I for one do not generally fall into the whole ""star-power to sell a movie"" trap, but this movie definetly backs up the stars with a unique set of sub-plots. I would have to say this is easily Tarantino's best film. I used to say that Resevoir Dogs rivaled it, but as it turns out he stole that idea."
5,"Good coffee, amazing movie","I love this movie. It is, no doubt, Travolta, Jackson and Tarentino at their best. The soundtrack is perfect and the dialogue still amuses me even after watching this for the hundreth time. It's violent, shocking, profane and hilarious."
4,good movie,"this is one of my all time favorite movies and it is superbone thing is wrong that i gave this 4 starstarantino not only portrays killing, snorting coke, shooting smack and drug dealing realistic but he portrayed as ""hip"" or ""cool"" that shouldnt be shown in movies that killing is cool only if it speaks the truthplus uma thurman acted like she was mother teresa in this movie which i couldnt stand,other than those things the film is fantastic and well written and directed id recommend it for indie and black humor fans"
1,Worst movie ever,"This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. It jumps around to the point that it makes no sense, is boring, has horrible characters, even worse acting.. basically every bad thing that a movie could be.. this one is. Don't waste any money on this trash. The only reason I'm rating it as 1 star is because there is no option for 0 stars."
2,Boring,"What has happened to Eddie Murphy!!!!!! Pretty okay concept and story line but the jokes were not funny. Cliched jokes with cliched storyline. I found myself getting bored and just wanted it to end. Eddie Murphy, please pick better roles with some original comedic material."
2,Great concept - Poor execution,"This tree that just sprung up in my back-yard looses leaves everytime I talk, write, type, text. When they're all gone I die.How important are the relationships in my life that I wouldn't use my last 1000 words to explain clerly whats going on? Job, baby momma. It just wasn't as funny as it could have been. Rated PG but typical Eddie Murphy foul language is in it.The funniest scene involves Eddies male apprentice trying to do a deal so he won't have to talk. This is a movie I coulda passed on."
3,These Words,I really enjoyed the overall message of this movie.. There were moments I laughed out loud - but there were times I felt the storyline/plot went South - but at the end everything came together. I love they casted Ruby Dee as Eddie Murphy's mom. Ruby Dee showed us that no matter what the script offers - when you are blessed with talent - you can make anything shine.3.5 Stars
4,not as bad as i thought,i first gave this cd a 2stars for party hard but i decided to one day give them another chance they are not great but they are good they are a fun band to listen to makes you want to bounce off the wall sometimes{:-)
1,Meathead Rock...,"Terrible. It's as if Beavis and Butthead have finally made an album. This guy must have the best publicity agent. Seriously, this is bad. And he managed to get a whole 35 minutes? Nice work. This album is Jello Biafra's worst nightmare.This music is for guys who go to bars with a pocketful of roofies. Just pure nonsense. Anyone who bought this disc will be placing it on their shelf along side ""Who Let the Dogs Out"". People who bought this probably also bought albums by Jackyl and Snow (you remember him from the earlier 90's - ""Informer, blah blah blah blah Informer"".If you haven't yet purchased this album, please don't..."
1,BUY THIS!!!,"Wow, this is so cool. Especially because I hate all other music. All other music is whiny nu-metal, and anything with emotion is stupid. I think these guys have skills. Gotta love how every track sounds the same, and how the drumming never changes in any song (bass-snare-bass-snare-bass-snare). I can't wait until Andrew goes home one night and blows his brains out just like Kurt Cobain did. Only then will I get a party started."
4,A carefully constructed call to arms...of party people!,"From the opening few chords of 'It's Time to Party', it is clear that Andrew WK has a eutopian vision of FUN!! The lyrics cry out equality: fun (and parties) being something to unite the whole world!To me this album is about equality, WK suggesting an alternative ideolgy to the dissillussioned. Even songs without the word 'party' in them have a sense of energy, but one that is not being forced on you.When I first heard this album I was pleased with my purchase, now I am overjoyed: This album is a rallying call to anyone who likes fun..."
5,Outstanding!,This album is filled with energy and awesome beats. I recommend it only to people who adventure to the world of Partying Hard. Whoever dares to buy this amazing artists' cd is in for beats for a good time.
4,The WOLF,"I am excited about the release of ""the wolf"" tomorrow. AWKs original album has been in my car CD player since i got it. ""Party Hard"" and ""Fun Night"" are my 2 favorite..I have heard his new album and it seems to fill you up more than a hearty meal."
5,AMAZING TUNES!!!!!,"You know what my definition of an amazing song is? Put a song on at a party and see if people can stand still. If they can't then it's amazing, in my humble opinion.Other amazing songs to give examples: Buddy Holly by Weezer, Play That Funky Music by Wild Cherry.Andrew WK has locked into something here. It's the music everybody wants to hear and loves to sing but nobody plays anymore.Thanks, buys, for giving the people what they want.PARTY HARD!!!!!"
1,is this a joke?,"Just buy the single and save yourself some money. Which single? Any single of his will do. All of these tracks sound identical. The CD begins to get repititous after about 1 1/2 songs. Is party even still a verb? I guess so according to this Einstein.Horrible, horrible CD."
1,Why???!!!,"I am having trouble understanding as to why this is getting such great reviews. I mean true, this is the funniest thing to come around since Prince, but [what the heck]. The minute I saw this clown on MTV I was shocked back into 1984 and wondering why if I was supposed to be PARTYING HARD, I was more compelled to leap out the second story window. That and I had to jump on the innerweb and try and find who this guy was. Don't you usually have to be someone in the music industry to call your band your name. Make it big with a band like hmmm Black Sabbath. Look at me I'm Andrew W.K. I'm ready to [stink] from day one. Well, I'll do one thing and that's follow the big W.K.'s advice and party till I puke, but more likely it's from hearing this music and laughing mid sip of booze."
5,The New Kayak Shop,"I wanted to buy a kayak, but when I saw the prices for a light, sea kayak ($2000 and up) I couldnt beleive it. I looked into building your own kayak...found a company called Cheaspeake Light Craft..the kits were cheap...the boats looked great....could I do this having little woodworking experience? Well, with the help of this book, the answer is a resounding yes!!"
2,disappointing advertisement,"This book did not meet my expectations. It does offer good wood working advice, and basic instructions of how to build a kayak, but the ""complete plans"" ""for three new boats"" listed on the cover consist of only three to five pages of tiny drawings for each boat. The author also encourages the reader to ""buy the plans, or kit, before building any of the kayaks. If I bought the kits, I would expect the directions to come with them, and I feel a bit hosed for paying $15 bucks for a collection of little more than advertisements."
4,Very good book for those who want to learn the stitch&glue method and have no background,The Kayak plans are detailed enough. No need to order the plans separately.I think that if you don't have any background in stitch&glue; it is a good start with.I have found the book very useful.
3,kayak shop,"This is a good book. Clear conceptions are presented. Good ideas and techicnics. building plans are a little limiteds and you will need some skill to make it usefull, but this is a book to people who has some skill. So the middle point is that books makes directions in sale building plans, may be this is the better idea to a kayak homemade. Plans could be more clear and you don't need to use a lent to read this font numbers or break your mind thinking how do somethings. To avoid this you will need to buy authors building plans."
2,Small print,"Although it is true that some of the material in this book is old (conversations about rotary telephones), my most serious complaint lies elsewhere and has to do with the fonts used in the printing. When the book was reprinted, a smaller format was chosen which means that the kanji are very small and difficult to read. In the advanced section, there are newspaper articles where the print is so tiny it becomes unreadable. It is almost impossible to count the strokes in the characters to look them up in a dictionary. In short, you need a magnifying glass to use this book once you get out of the elementary section. That is a pity. Learning Japanese is great but not at the expense of one's eyesight."
3,eh,"there's nothing wrong with it, its just very limited.Don't expect much conrete information, but it doescover the basics of faunal analysis."
4,Good cable,"It's 6' in length, plenty for what I need. Reliable and fast. Not sure I can say much more about it."
5,kv,"I have not taken this CD out of the car player for three months!I had never heard of Bet Williams or Epiphany Project but happened to see a concert in Morrisville, NY. It was one of the best shows I have ever seen and the CD has since become one of my favorites. Melodic, almost spiritual, a voice accompanied by piano that is meditative yet energetic."
1,WARNING!!! READ THIS FIRST!,"This controller [stinks]... It is nothing like the real Nintendo Controller and is a very cheap controller.First of all, the shape is horrible. It is a struggle to keep in your hand, and it dosn't ""fit"" into your hand like the real Nintendo one.Next, the buttons are too small and hard to reach.Don't come near this controller, no matter what the package looks like. This is not a controller, it is just a hugeWASTE OF MONEY!!!Buy the real deal, the Nintendo Controller made by Nintendo.THIS REALLY DESERVES A ZERO OR NEGATIVE NUMBER OF STARSDO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!"
5,Ben Folds Five Stars,"&#65533;Whatever and Ever, Amen&#65533; is truly a flawless, matchless album. Ben Folds&#65533;s writing skills are perhaps only matched with his amazing piano work, from his aggressive hooks on &#65533;One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces&#65533; and &#65533;Song For the Dumped&#65533; (really, can anyone else write AGGRESSIVE piano music?) to his incredibly subtle work on &#65533;Selfless, Cold, and Composed&#65533;, it all just flows. The album has a definite sorrowful feel to it, as most good albums do, although &#65533;Kate&#65533; and &#65533;Steven&#65533;s Last Night in Town&#65533; are appropriately joyful and exuberant. And of course, &#65533;Brick&#65533;, the Five&#65533;s one hit single, is truly beautiful, amazing, and poignant. Superb all around.Oh, and the drummer is amazing as well."
4,Ben Folds Five Are Great!,"I had never heard of Ben Folds Five until I heard ""Brick."" I thought the song had a really interesting messege and sound BUT i thought they were just another one hit guys band. I bought the CD anyway and was sort of surprised when ALL the songs rocked....BEN FOLDS FIVE are EXCELLENT!"
4,"Pretty Good, Worthwhile","I bought this cd because of hearing Brick, and after listening to the whole cd, it still remains my favorite. Most of the cd is good, with a few disapointments, namely Song For The Dumped. All together, a good cd."
2,please save my ears,"I was browsing through a the record shop at the mall and saw ben folds five...the first thing that came to mind was the song ""kate"". I looked through the cds and realized this was the cd that had it. One of the girls that worked there saw me looking at it and said this cd was on her list of top 5 cds...so being that i knew i liked ""kate"" and that this girl loved this cd i bought it. This is the worst (money) i have ever spent in my whole life. I give it two stars because they have good lyrics, and i still do like the song kate. As a band they (...) as writers they are very good.I think a career in song writing would be better than a career as a band for these guys"
