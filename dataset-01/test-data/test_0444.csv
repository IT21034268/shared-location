4,Outstanding!,"This is one great game! There are numerous positive points, too many to list here. On the negative side I would have to say that the graphics are fair, not exceptional. The explosions could have been done a little better. The backgrounds (buildings and such) were moderate. However I can live with the graphics because the gameplay doesn't suffer in any way. There are only 6 different terrains to play on and they get old very quickly. Other than that, this game is fantastic. The voice chat is great too. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes fast paced action games."
4,This game rocks!,"I really loved this game! The graphics are amazing, except for the little people, but who cares anyway? Who ever reads this review has to buy the game. What I was amazed about was that the game doesn't get so boring so fast. I Love the game! You will too!"
5,A telegame,Man what a title... an online game(wahoo) with voice chat... how great can that be? Man can u imagine talking to your friends via Dreamcall? this is like getting a phone and much much more... a great port of a good arcade game. The arcade version had a link between two arcade consoles... so i couldnt try the voice chat there...but if its anything like dreamcall itll be fantastic... great controls in this tank/scifi shoot em up' generic...also check out the graphics... 2 words... 2 sweet. If this title plays like it did in the arcade... we're in 4 a real thriller.
5,Outstanding Jazz!,"This outstanding collection includes the best work of this jazz pioneer and his big band. Includes many classics such as ""I Would Do Anything for You"" and what many believe to be Hopkins' greatest composition, ""Mush Mouth""."
2,Best basketball game on dreamcast...still it's medicore,"good:-shooting feels realistic-swat blocks are cool-cool create-a-player option-franchise mode is the most in depth I've seen in a basketball game-player introductions are cool the first time you see thembad:-players move like uncoordinated middle aged men playing basketball in the drive way (eg. point gaurd has a permanent hunchback)-even a lightning fast player like Allen Iversonb can't manage to dribble around a sloth like Bryant Reeves-created players can't be used in franchise mode-if you back down on your man you will not finish with a dunk (I've backed guys down to almost directly under the hoop with Shaq and all he, and any big man, ever does is layups and hook shots.)-FASTBREAKS ARE NON-EXISTANT! if you pass the ball up the court the guy you are passing to stops in his path allowing four defensive players to get back to stop the fastbreak, one of the most exciting moments in basketball is not in this game."
1,It's just like 2K1,"I have this game and 2K1. It's a fun game for the most part. It has player updates and statistics but the truth is, somtimes I forget if it's 2K2, or 2K1!!!"
4,"Fast delivery, great product.","This CD is wonderful. If you need to relax and want to hear some beautiful, haunting music, this is it. I listen to it almost daily."
3,Delicious Cherry Gum,"The flavor doesn't last, like so many of the nice things in this life, so enjoy it while it does. Then again, it's just gum, so, really, not that big a deal when you really think about it."
2,Not what I thought it would be....big disappointment..,"While I am not a regular American Idol veiwer or a fan, upon channel surfing and hearing this guy sing, I thought, finally a guy that is gonna come out of this rediculous contest and do something real. Well, was I wrong. This CD, while the vocals ARE good (hence the 2 stars), the songs are awful. the same old regurgitated ""new rock"" junk that has already been recycled and remade way too many times. Hopefully he will be like Kelly Clarkson and get from under those industry people involved with the Idol machine and one day find and let us hear his own voice....cause I don't think this is it. At least, I hope not."
1,Can't tell it's Bo at all!,"Bo always presented himself as a southern rocker. This is a pop album. Fluffy pop/rock if you want to be charitable. There's no ""rock"" in the album, and certainly no southern rock. It's not only that the songs are generic pop, but they also made Bo's voice generic. If I had listened to the tracks without knowing who was singing, I wouldn't have known it was Bo"
3,Wanted to Love It!,"Hmmm,I was a tad disappointed with Bo's first CD. LOVED him on Idol, wanted him to win. As a forty-something the southern rock thing was my kind of music, unfortunately, this CD is a bit more pop,no rock and EVERY song sounds the same. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy it, but I can't wait for the next CD in hopes it will showcase Bo's rockin' voice, this was a bit too tame."
5,Amazing,"Bo does an out-of-this world job on his first record. WOW!! I have listened to it at least a dozen times. He reveals so much of himself through his music. I believe he has made himself a star. You go, Bo!!"
5,Really good singer,"I really like this album, Bo rocks! He can just keep up the awesome work and as long as he does i'll be here buying his stuff. He sold very well, he didn't sell amazingly well like Carrie(who's also very talented) but he did sell well, and I think he has a bright future. Hopefully he'll have more input on his next album."
4,Worth the Listen,"I never watched AI until I heard the buzz about a couple rockers this past season. One of those rockers, Bo Bice, made it to #2 which was plenty exposure as it was. I ordered his CD put out with Sugarmoney in 2000 (Recipe for Flavor) earlier this year and it's stellar - it's one of my favorite CDs in my collection. I just got ""The Real Thing"" last night and have listened to it several times now.Okay, other reviewers are correct when they say it's pretty commercial and a bit more ""pop"" than the southern fried rock Bo fans might hope for. But that's marketing for you! Take it for what it is - and it really is a good album. Worth the time!Bo is only beginning. A fledgling artist needs to conform a little bit - As he grows with his new label and producers I believe we'll see him become more the artist we saw on AI and heard in his pre-AI efforts. I for one am looking forward to the ride."
3,The OKAY thing,"I really liked Bo when he was on American Idol so I thought I would get his first album. Some of the songs are really good but I don't think there is enough variance in the type of songs. I also expected the album to include at least one of the cover songs he sang so well on the show - there are none. Overall, enjoyable but could have been better."
5,Underrated Star!,"3.5 stars??? are you crazy! This is one of the best Cd's out there today! Bo rocks, and this CD is one you can listen to over and over, and people of any age would love it!"
2,Who is this person pretending to be Bo Bice?,"I only gave this CD 2 stars because it is Bo.This CD is milksop. It pains me to say that, as I am a Bo fan. I could not tell when one song ended and the next began. It is no better than the lindsay lohan or ashlee simpson pop pablum.Also, WHO IS THE MAN ON THE COVER OF THIS CD? What did they do with our Bo?!? I could not believe it. The back of the CD is more like the Bo I watched for weeks on end. I am so disappointed.I went to the SugarMoney site and ordered their 5-song cd. That is much better than this over produced drivel. At least it sounds like Bo.I hope he can survive Clive Davis's pop-conveyor belt producing, and come out on the other side and play his own music. Curses on Clive Davis! Curses!"
2,Sickening Sweet,"Bo..you could do so much better. This was totally not what I expected from Bo. I followed his entire AI trip, and eagerly awaited this album. His previously released single ""Vehicle"" was fantastic, ya know the kind of music you want to crank until your car window explode. But this was awful! I felt like I was listening to Bo singing to his wife...yuck! Almost every song was about how he couldn't be without her. Whatever. Totally not the rock music I was hoping for. I give two stars out of kindness, because I know Bo has the potential and certainly the pipes to do a better album. But I'm not waiting around to see when that'll happen. Sorry."
1,"Woah, not much to say, it's as bad as you would fear and then some","I'm surprised Bo only co-wrote/wrote two songs on the album itself though; since he's supposedly the ""real experienced rocker"" type I would've expected more. Seems like his material was mostly relegated to the dual disc, either because it's not commercial enough or not good enough or both.After listening to the 2 tunes (which on this album of subpar pop ), it's clear that they are not good enough as single material. Hope this pop cliche avenue bodes well for the powers that be behind this commercialization of Bo Bice. I ain't buying the next CD until I Hear all of the audio clips, Now that is the REAL deal!"
2,Bad album..,no song here is consider a hit..i gave it 2 stars because I USED TO LIKE HIM ON MAERICAN IDOL..
5,side by side forever - - we'll be together,"I am an avid Idol fan, and was thrilled to see someone with Bo Bice's talent appear on the show. It was great to see someone who has the harder edge. I was looking forward to listening to this albumn. While it wasn't the Southern Rock music I was anticipating, I really enjoyed listening to it and look forward to Bo's next album."
5,Great Debut CD,"I love this cd, especially tracks 7, 9, 10 and 11. I love the whole cd, but these 4 are my absolute favourites. Each song grows on me every time I listen and find something new about each song.Please buy the dualdisc and give his original songs a listen, as well as viewing the video. Bo is so natural and funny - you cannot help but love him."
3,Disappointing,"Just LOVED Bo on American Idol and couldn't wait for a CD. While his voice is excellent, thought too many of the same, slow love songs on this CD. Was hoping for a more upbeat country rock type CD."
4,Great Job,I've listened to this CD several times. I have a thing for voices and Bo has an interesting voice. It's the voice that will make me stop and listen. Bo vocals on this CD were great and so was the music. There are only two good things that have come out of American Idol and Bo's one of them.
2,I loved Bo in AI.,"This isn't the music I thought Bo would be making. It's not his fault, and Carrie did a much better job, mainly coz she stayed completely and utterly true to herself. I hope your second album will be the CD you wanted to make, Bo, but not this pop-rock music. This isn't ""The Real Thing"" at all, neither is it the real Bo. Hang in there."
2,Every Song Sounded The Same,"I did not enjoy this CD because every song sounded the same and the band practically drowned out his voice. I, like many that watched and crossed their fingers for Bice to win American Idol, was completely taken by shock at the fact that this is a cheesy pop rock CD. I expected some acoustic, soulful, Counting Crows meets Lynryd Skynrd meets Soundgarden variety. Perhaps a gratuitous Willie Nelson or Howlin' Wolf re-make thrown in to further spotlight Bice's nearly supernatural voice?"
2,Typical,"No matter how hard Bo Bice tries, no matter how foreboding the surface, beneath it all he's still light and frivolous. But that doesn't mean, by any stretch, that this is bubblegum music, since that term implies that this music is frothy, fun, and, most important, hooky, and The Real Thing is none of those things. Typical runner-up baggage. Bo Bice deserved better and after a few listens, his fans will be left waiting for the day he is able to provide something more."
1,"1 Star for the CD, 5 Stars for the Dualdisc","Thanks American Idol people for ruining Bo's image and voice!!I can't believe this Cd!! It sounds like something my parents would listen to and think it's cool!The first song The Real Thing doesn't even sound like Bo! It's good on the radio though but i don't understand what happened? Bo is not orginal at all! Shameful shameful, I am so sad for him! This could be the end!People, buy the dualdisc you at least get some video of Bo so you know it's him not some cheap dumb singer like they made on this Cd.I Think Idol is punishing Bo like they did with the other runner ups and they gave him all the bad songs!I am never watching Idol again!! I hate you Idol!"
1,"""TH EREAL THING"" ARE YU SERIOUS??",NO OFFENSE PPL BUT THIS GUY CANT` SING.WHEN HE SING`S IT`S HAS A HORRIFIC VOICE ND IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY TO BUY THIS CD.YOU WILL DISAGREE WIF MEH` BUT DIS IS MY OPINION
1,No originality at all...,"Look at most of the 4-5 stars on here... all female groupies loving it because he's ""good-looking"" even though they haven't seen him in real life.It's music not modeling everyone (well... even though you need a body and he does not)Obviously he is American Idol ""darling""... he won.About music now;The only skill I could see is he's got a good voice, he had vocal lessons no doubt about it, and the rest?He didn't write half of his songs, and as they said, he had some of the best song-writers out there, don't be fool.Secondly, well what else?This album might have a few songs with decent lyrics, the music is not there at all, boring and all of the same, nothing original.Everyone knows he made money... and who bought it? read my first paragraph...Finally, while he's in ""Rock""... buy James Blunt's album instead, or whatever, just don't waste your money on ""The Real Thing""."
2,BO-ring,"I was quite disappointed in this CD -- not in Bice's vocals, but the insipid songs and lyrics. Bo's a rocker, not a pop balladeer. Maybe next time they'll let him sing more raw, rocking material, and give Bice his bite back."
5,Gets Better With Each Listen,"Each time I play this album the songs continue to get better and better. I have a new favorite each time around. The music syncs so well with Bo's voice. He's in step with every word and lyric through the entire recording. I have to say that I'm impressed the more I hear it. Great job, Bo!!!"
2,Tepid and uninteresting,"This effort by Bo was very disappointing. The guy singing on the CD has nothing to do with the totally out of control guy I saw on the American Idol stage. The songs DO all sound the same and not one of them makes me want to listen to this CD again. It's gone into my pile of stupid purchases and will be priced at a futureyard sale for about 50 cents. When I think of the wonderful heart and soul he brought to the stage in songs that showcased his country rock and roll roots and then I hear the pap on this CD, I know Bo is heading in the wrong direction. I'm not particularly fond of the hard rocker Bo either, but think his best vocals will be found in country rock and soul."
3,"""The Real Thing"" NOT the REAL Bo","It is so apparent that these songs were written to appeal to the mainstream pop music listener...boring. However, I know this has nothing to do with Bo's incredible talents. The only song that shows a little Bo is ""Valley of Angels,"" which Bo co-wrote. I was so impressed with Bo on Idol...and was looking forward to this album so much...I am sad now. Can't wait until he can do his own thing and be his REAL self. My suggestion...buy the album to support Bo, and try to get your hands on ""Recipe for Flavor"" by Bo Bice and Sugar Money."
2,Great voice going to waste,"This album is just a collection of boring, soft, ready-for-radio irrelevant songs. After a while the songs start to sound almost the same, faceless mainstream rock. Too much collaborators, too little Bo. A little bit more freedom would have resulted in a much more interesting album. It's like a soundtrack to a some trendy TV show.The guy does his best with the songs he's been given. He has such a good rock voice that it is a shame to hear it going to waste with a pile of generic unmemorable songs. Afterall this is a guy that became popular singing songs he liked that were almost entirely alien (Allman Brothers, Badlands, Jim Croce...) to the core audience of American Idol.Next time let the guy really do his thing. The demos with his band Sugar Money are way superior. ""The Real Thing""? I don't think so, maybe the next album."
4,Bo Grows On You!,"Upon first listen to this CD, I felt that Bo had really sold out. I wanted some nitty-gritty Bo singing, much as he did on American Idol with ""For The Love of Money,"" ""Stand By Me,"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama."" This album is not like that at all. It is pretty much a pop record, as opposed to the southern rocker album I would have expected from Bo. I was highly disappointed upon my first few listens...YET... as I listened repeatedly, the album began to grow on me, and now, I can accept it for what it is: a finely crafted collection of catchy pop songs sung by a man with a heck of a good voice! It is now one of my favorite CDs to just put on and let play as I work, clean, do odd jobs around the house, and I always find myself singing along. Good job, Bo. Evenso, let's hope that when you get around to CD #2 that you can do a little more of what your fans crave from you."
1,"The New and Improved ""Scratch-n-Sniff""","Where you don't even have to scratch, it stinks all on it's own. Horrid debut for Bice- lackluster songs, weak seemingly computer generated vocals, stupid lyrics, no melody- there is a reason why it's getting bad reviews from magazines, it's NOT GOOD. I would sample some of these songs before you buy it, this is so no rock - it's more like schlock.This must have been a great present for Underwood fans. Any anxiety that Bice might take the spotlight away from her deservedly great album was laid to rest when they heard this awful junk. They must be sleeping like ""babies.""This is horrible. Go listen for yourself."
2,Expected More!,"I was a big fan of Bo throughout season 4. I liked Carrie too, but I prefer rock over country.This album is okay. I guess I just expected more from Bo. It sounds to me as if he rushed the album to market. Not a bad strategy if you want to capitalize on the momentum from the show, but that strategy does not usually produce great songs.The Real Thing is a great song, but that is the only song I would put in that category. My recommendation would be to preview the songs on iTunes and just buy the ones you want. It is probably not worth it to buy the whole album.I expect his next album to be better...I know he has it in him."
1,"only good for Idol Bo fans, nothing new or great here","I did not expect Bo to inject new life into the music business or be the saviour of rock, but I did expect his album to be better than most of the stuff I buy, and it just turned out to be the same or slightly worse. If I was not introduced to him through AI and had not seen some of his live performances, this is not an album that I would have bought. What would make me happy is if he releases an album good enough so that I could say no matter how he became known to me I would have bought this album and as of yet he has not done that"
2,Not at all what I excepted..,"I always thought Bo had a good voice and could sing good, but something, just something, isn't right with this CD. I don't get it. Bo seemed exciting and whatnot and this CD is boring. I do think he sings good but this CD, it sounds as if he's mumbling and they words wern't clear! It's a DISSAPOINTMENT!"
3,Bo Bice,"I have to agree, I expected alittle more from Bo. His voice is amazing and should of one. However, I thought his album would of been alttile more rockin like ""vehical song"" his Skynard songs, ect...Not saying he should of made a cover tune album...but that would of been good too!"
1,Stinks like dogpoo on hot concrete,"This album is some sort of bad joke on Bo's fans. He calls it the real thing yet at times he seems like he is doing a bad impression of Kelly Clarkson and then other times a bad impression of Bon Jovi. Who can know what is real or not?The songs are really bad. The first single is kinda catchy, that's why I bought the album, though it's nothing that great. I like ""It's my Life"" but that's about it- the rest sound the same, he should have called the album ""processed cheese"" because that is what it is. We Bo fans would buy it regardless, I think Clive Davis knew that so did not care about us or what we wanted. What a shame. Wait for his second album, if he gets a chance to do one, this one is the pits."
5,crazy wolf,I enjoyed this cd alot. I listen to it all the time. It is one of my top five favorite cds. I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes great music.
1,When will Idol learn!!,"P know American Idol tries to get these cds out in a hurry but that is not necessarily a good thing. I liked Bo's voice, it sounds a lot better than it did on the show. That's why I gave a star. The songs stink, too much alike. I'm just telling it like it is. This is a filler cd. You have Idol to thank for that. Rush jobs hardly ever create great art."
2,Misstep,"I think this album was a terrible misstep on the part of 19. Maybe marketing to a younger audience will prove to be a financially wise move, but it's an artistic mistake. I really hope Bo can come back and do an album in his own style. Seriously, this is pretty depressing."
1,"Love the CD, can't wait for the concert!","The more that I listen to this CD, the more I love it. Right from the first listen I loved every track. That is so rare these days to buy a CD and find that every song on it moves you in one way or another. My favorite songs seem to change just about every day. Since picking it up on Dec. 13th and now having heard it, oh say 100 times, I really like U Make Me Better and Hold On To Me. There's a nice mix on this CD of just how talented Bo Bice is and it's demonstrated with the smooth easy voice to some of the more rough rock tracks. Very SEXY to my little ole' ears. YOU NAME THE DATE AND TIME FOR THE CONCERT AND BO I WILL BE THERE!!!!!"
1,loved it!,"really good. really really good! i just want to keep listening! GO BO! This is a great CD!!! i would buy if your and Bo fan, but if your not, u should still buy it and I bet you will become a fan!!!!"
1,"1 Star for Bo's trying, his fans dont' care about quality anyway so it won't matter","Bo Bice's album only gets 1 star from me, no matter how many crazy and untrue 5 star reviews the diehard Bo fans posts. It is NOT a 5 star album by any means. It's cute that his fans are dillusional to think it is. They can give it 4 stars if they love it but 5 is just laughable..lol! I am just saying my honest opinion, that it doesn't deserve anything better than 1 star"
5,Really awesome CD,"I love this CD so much you wouldn't even ebleive. I can't believe anybody this good has come out of that dreadful sitcom, American Idol."
2,"After a long wait, sadly dissapointed.","Bo was my favorite Idol contestant last year. So, I couldn't wait to get his first album. Before this album came out, I was going to buy the two song CD, with Vehicle and Inside Your Heaven, but I didn't buy it because I figured, why waste my money on only 2 songs. I figured the album would be better. I was wrong.When my daughter and I listened to the CD for the first time, we were dissapointed. Every song sounds pretty much the same - white washed cookie cutter pop. The cd has been sitting around my van unlistened to every since.I was hoping to hear some Southern rock style or classic rock style tunes or something at least close to that. Maybe it's because he's new to the industry and hasn't figured out how to work the business yet. I hope he changes and gets some real good music out soon."
2,Put out an A.P.B on the REAL Bo Bice,"He sure isn't on this cd..He does make a few cameo appearences on songs like, ""U Make Me Better,"" and ""Valley of Angels,"" but for the most part, it's easy to see that 19 Entertainment's song mill and ""consultants"" were working overtime on this project.. Even Bo's talent and overall likability do not allow him to shine through the painfully trite material he was stuck with. If you like redundant songs that border on the mundane, all the while possessing all of the intellect and wisdom of a self-help book or a fortune cookie, BUY THIS ALBUM!!! As for the rest of us, I would suggest waiting for the album to tank, Bice to be released from his contract, and then picking up his follow up... THAT WILL BE THE REAL BO BICE."
3,The Real Thing,Bo is hot!This CD is not!I loved Bo on Idol but this doesn't showcase his amazing talent.
5,Bo Rocks!,Way to go! You rock so hard BO! I love this album so much! Keep up the awesome work. You will always be my Idol!
1,bad,I would like to give zero stars for this awful album. The album is like ONE LONG SONG with a bunch of pauses in between.
1,A copycat,his trying to be Gavin Degraw..but still he's no match of Gavin..Gavin plays instrument..compose great songs..and vocally talented..you? you are just a runner up in American Idol..and this album further destroy your career..this album is not nice at all..sounds so ordinary..
1,The Fake Thing,The Real Thing---sounded very 'enhanced'You're Everything---an okay song..he oversang it..U Make Me Better---read the lyrics..no meaning..Nothing Without You---best song in here..but doesnt mean its a good songMy World---sucks! gavin degraw poserRemember Me---nonono..oversangHold On To Me---very 'enhanced'Lie...It's Alright---i hate the lyrics..no meaningIt's My Life--Bon Jovi poserWilling To Try--and you failed to even tryValley Of Angels---angels fly away afetr this song..
5,Great pan!,"I have used the pan only for a few days, but I really like it. It has a very solid feeling to it, heats up evenly and the non-stick coating works great. Too early to say anything about its durability yet, but so far I am very happy with it."
4,A great example of what history can be,"Between Alfred Crosby and Richard Collier, these two men have written the definitive works on the Spanish Influenza Pandemic of 1918. Subsequent writers like Iezzoni and Kolata heavily use the primary reseach done by both Crosby and Collier.Crosby's work does, to some degree, lack eloquent narrative, but it is a superbly researched book on the pandemic. Crosby sticks to the facts and statistics and has achieved a work that is well written history. I would recommend reading Richard Collier's work in conjunction with this work to get the full impact of the pandemic. Crosby focuses on the pandemic's impact in America while Collier focuses on the more global experience. While Collier may have a better flowing narrative, Crosby includes all of the hard statistics which lends a different, more concrete feeling to the subject matter. Overall, if Crosby's work is the left shoe, Collier's is the right shoe. You can read one without the other, but, why would you want to?"
4,Normal guys drink blood,"Nice to see a book that showcases both the essences of magik and the normalcy of vampires. Nasaw brings to the front the more palitable side of things most perceive as dark and evil. He shows that magik, love, and the thirst for blood can be as normal an existance as Leave it to Beaver. Never mind that someone is out to destroy all three! The suspenseful nature of the writing, along with the sympathetic characterizations makes this work a non-stop thrill. I loved the sense of humor, the emotion, and the richness of the story. It was definite a must read for me."
4,DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS 8051,DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS ON 8051 MICRO CONTROLLER 8 BIT
4,Mouse and Keyboard unwork,"This unit is small, alright, and it it hard to install all the cables in tight quarters. However, once hooked up, the video part worked right off. By I could not get the mouse or keyboard to work, even though I was using the same cables in use for the previous 2-port switcher. also there is an extra row of connectors not labeled nor mentioned in the manual??Anybody have any suggestions why the mouse and keyboard dead? If it weren't for that I would rate this thing about 4 stars."
4,Cybex vs Avocent,"Hmmm. Either Avocent bought Cybex or visa versa. See my review of this product under ""Avocent 4 port Switchview""."
3,an E Ticket,"For a far fetched story line, its not a bad movie.Its got a budget, fine actors, and lots of special effects.The ending is a complete let down and if its possibe, even more far fetched than the rest of the movie.But if you want to settle down and enjoy decent acting and lots of improbable intrigue; mixed with lots of gun fire, this is your movie.But leave your adult brain at the door."
2,One time flick,I saw this movie in the theater. It was very predictable and is something that I would not purchase for a DVD collection.
5,FACED PACED SCI FI THRILLER! 4 1/2 STARS!,"I know, I know! This film is implausible, it could have had a better actor (Shia LaBeouf) in the lead, but growing up loving the sci-fi genre of yesteryear, I had to think about my rating on those terms. In the old days of sci-fi films(50's, 60's and 70's) we didn't always get the best actors or special FX and the plots were certainly a bit of a stretch to say the least. So if you compare this film to some of those old lovable and laughable classics; this film is really quite interesting and very well done. Sure there are many moments where everything works out too conveniently, but it's a sci-fi fantasy and I can forgive that because it's a well executed story with an intriguing plot.I really liked this film and I think those of you who go into this film with the right frame of mind will truly enjoy it despite its minor shortcomings. Of course this film is considered sci-fi now, but who knows if it's not reality in a few years!"
4,"Good, but not great......","I thought the movie was pretty suspenseful and overall was good. The general plot that computers are taking over seems exceedingly used in the theaters and TV. But between the actors, special effects and storyline the film seems to keep you wanting to know whats next and interested. 4 stars"
1,Is Spielberg (Exec. Producer) Losing His Touch?,"The most positive aspect of this movie is that it ends after approx. 2 hours. Of course, then you're left with the realization that you'll never get those wasted 2 hours back. Honestly, there is not one redeeming aspect of this film that I can identify, which is surprising given the fantastic cast. Special FX-driven action movies need to be moderately plausible and at the same time not take themselves too seriously. ""Eagle Eye"" fails miserably on both counts, adding insult to injury by insulting the audience's intelligence throughout its arduous 2 hour length. With Spielberg as an executive producer on this one, and given last year's Indian Jones installment, I'm given to wonder if Mr. Spielberg might be losing his touch."
3,Really is closer to 3.5 stars,"Don't analyze...just watch the movie and enjoy the action (which is actually rather nicely done)! The most unsettling hook in the story is the fact that our government goes against available intelligence recommendation and makes a very rash decision with international implications. Now who would ever imagine that happening.The acting was good overall. Thornton was a little flat, but since he protects us from evil and ends up buying the farm because of it, I can forgive. Shia is just a pleasure to watch, but I would like to see him step out of the ""just a dumb kid...uh oh, the world as we know it is about to end...ok, I saved it"" roles. I'd like to see him paired up with Jodie Foster in something intelligent with a few wicked twists.My recommendation: Check the right side of your brain at the door, grab the popcorn, and...please...turn your cell phone OFF!!!"
3,"Good rental, doubt I would watch again","I rented this off netflix, and thought it had decent entertainment value. Good the first time around, but I dont think I will ever want to see this again. There is no replay or lasting value to this movie.Sure the price is great, but there are plenty of other great Blu Ray choices for the same/similar price."
1,eagle eye,Never received my product. The worst service I ever had after years of service with amazon.com. Amazon should drop this third party client. Zero rating.
1,Wamp Wamp....,"Terrible movie, saw it in theatres. Shi laBeof was good in Disturbia, but that doesn't mean he should play the exact same charecter the rest of his life...Plot is boring and extremely predictable, do not waste your time..."
2,A Bit More Research Needed,"While this new ""authorized"" biography of Loretta Young was an interesting and quick read (2 nights), I was disturbed that there were some errors in it. While I can't remember them all at this point in time, I remember actor Frederic March's name being mispelled as Marsh, as one of them. I would have liked more interviews with those who worked with Loretta on her films."
3,The most academic of dog books.,"This is the most academic of dog books, but really more a journal in no particular order. I'm uncomfortable with a guy who want to breed his bitches with wolves, jackals, dingos . . . . Not partial to making naturally wild animals live in captivity. What's wrong with regular dogs?"
2,Come on...,"Some of the reviews are only saying this game is good because its Gundam Wing. I like Gundam's just as much as the next guy, but come on, COME ON, this game has a terrible framerate, bad graphics (for PS2), and many other bad features. Although this game has many good features, like its cinematics, and replayability, it is a very subpar game. Wait for the new Gundam title to be released in the soon future, which is guarenteed by Bandai to have a higher framerate, and better gameplay."
2,Not as good as it looks.,"I rented this game and found it to be ok, at first, but then after few minutes of playing it became borring, frustrating, and repetitive. The graphics did not enpress me that much either. I'm not really a Gundam fan, though I have seen a few episodes and they were pretty cool, but the only reason most people like this game is because they are hard core Gundam fans and will buy anything with a Gundam label on it."
1,Get what you pay for,"Earpiece is the worst sound possible; the ""leather"" case split when opening out of the bag. The only thing that is worth the price was the car charger."
1,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with this bra. I would definately not recommend it. If you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the Maternelle bra instead.This bra looks sexy, but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra (at least not for a size 38DD)."
4,Excellent BUT...,"A well-packed CD with sound much improved from the old RCA Greatest Hits volumes, but two glaring omissions cost this compilation a five-star rating : where is ""Matilda"" and ""Turn Around""? The search for the definitive one-disk Belafonte anthology goes on..."
3,basic khan,"this dvd, narrated by Peter Graves, with mostly artwork sketches and very little real action is pretty much basic with I believe, quite a bit left out.The dvd is ok but I must admit, somewhat disappointing compared with other works on Khan.The price is reasonable but not especially so."
3,Hopelessly out of date,"Not much point in buying this book unless you enjoy living in the past. Far too many musicians like to do that, in fact. There have been so many advances in amplifier technology in the past 13 years that this book can only interest those who collect vintage amps or are just looking for old sound. And there are better resources than this for that.Besides, any amplification book that neglects brands like Peavey (!!!!), Carvin, Trace Elliot, Hughes&Kettner; and Traynor (!!) among others is incomplete. Would you buy a book about the Japanes auto industry if it didn't discuss Honda and Subaru?I say, keep looking dudes."
4,Can't beat it for the money,"The previous reviewer did a great job of summarizing this Australian collection. I assume its not remastered, however the sound quality is fine. It is a rather haphazard, but unique collection of Nilsson's work with strong emphasis of material from Schmillson and A little touch (in fact both entire albums, the majority of Pussy Cats and miscellaneous cuts from early and later albums. Not bad at all - especially as an introductory purchase."
5,Best Bang for Your Buck,"This book well serves the novice looking to acquire his or her first corn snake. If you follow the advice in this book your snake will do great. Are there other opinions out there? Sure. I recommend reading EVERYTHING you can find about corn snakes. A well read snake keeper is a smarter snake keeper. That said, Kathy Love has been breeding corns for a long time, and knows what she is doing. Bill and Kathy's book is written in a pretty casual style, without a lot of technical jargon and is easily understood by even a complete new-comer to the reptile keeping hobby."
1,An okay book,This book was very very very very very very very very very very gooooooooooodAlthough it was a little too explanatory!
1,Problems and More,"I was very satisfied with Money 99 and purchased Money 2002 with the hopes of a similar experience. Unfortunately, the program never worked properly on my computer which runs Windows 98 version 1. I could only load the program from the Taskbar as the Desktop Icon and Start Menu selection would not work. Additionally, during installation an updated Internet Explorer was installed. Afterwards, I experienced numerous lock-ups while on the internet and eventually my computer crashed and would not reboot. After reinstalling my operating system I installed Money 2002 fresh without my backup data. This time similar problems but now there was no icon on the Taskbar and absolutely no way to load the program. I'm now back to using Money 99 and my computer is again operating smoothly."
4,A little disappointed,I found these CD labels to be in such a position that the contents of the label are crooked leaving little white spaces at the center hole or on the edges. Ruins the professional look.
3,some good ..some bad,The Roaring Forties and the Roquefort were not included and the substitutes were acceptable but not of the highest quality. The biggest disappointment was the Stilton which was overipe and had a very strong ammonia odor. In the past I have ordered this same selection and everything was great ..I am hoping this was just a regrettable incident.
5,Amazing kid!!,"Melody sings beautifully and she knows what she does. I wish she keeps singing, but as she grows, more mature themes. Listen to De pata negra cd and also Muevete which is really good and you can see the change in her voice. Also had you seen the resemblance to Emma Watson (Hermione from Harry Potter Movies). I strongly recommend at least the first two cd's."
3,ok but not the original.,"this game is ok for the younger gents out there.its an easy setup for xp or vista, but you will need a special font.so you must contact scholastic customer service to obtain this patch.the game will not run without it.they are one of the nicest people around so it sould be easy as pie.overall its a game about math fractions, counting money ect...very good for ages 10-30 years.personally i like the arcade at the end."
1,Merle Haggard Super Hits 2 CD Set,"It is a doulbe CD with all the favorites listed. However, the recordings of these hit songs is a watered down ""Nashville"" style re-recording that hurts to listen to. And there is no notation on the cover letting the buyer know this information. It leads you to believe that they are the original recordings."
1,Makes me ashamed for the author...,"Good grief, why did that little line at the start... ""without editorial input' not warn me?Sure the top writers around the world need editors, but this work is so perfect it doesn't?The grammar and spelling mistakes littered through the book are atrocious. Even some of the worst fanfiction writers manage to run spell-check.Then a character arrived with 'violet eyes', a fanfiction favourite that should have sent me running to the hills.I like the idea of bringing fantasy into the grittier parts of Britain, but everything else here has been done to death. Villains laugh hysterically; heroes stand dramatically shouting 'NO!' to the horizon; everyone is extraspeciallysuper beautiful and handsome."
1,Also stopped working after about a year and half,"Was initially very pleased with the product. Easy installation and use as advertised and seemed to be all that I hoped it would be. However, after about a year and a half the unit began to malfunction and then ultimately stop working. Unfortunately it was out of warranty and nothing could be done. Will not buy the same brand again as I see others having the same problem."
5,21st Century Timemachine,"Very successfull band from Tampere, Finland. They started in 1984, and recorded a few classic Psycho/Neo-Rockabilly songs in the 1980's (see the famous ""2nd Psycho Attack Over Europe!"").Guitarist Sami Roine always tried to find his own originality, and here is a good example of his musicial experiments. Stringbeans can play many music styles: from psychobilly to surf.Sami is one of the best Finnish guitarists, and so are his friends: Ville, Tumppi and some guest musicians. Fine produced compilation contains the best tracks from Stringbeans albums, unreleased and alternative versions. The hidden track is just a fun joke from Sami and Co."
5,Lord Soth,"Excellent book. Lord Soth is one of my favorite characters in the Dragonlance universe. This book adds to the Lord Soth legacy and aspects of his personality and character. Additionally, it was interesting to read about Krynn's most infamous character in a setting outside of Krynn."
4,Good but disappointing,"I was disappointed with the ending which seemed rather anti-climatic and rushed. This book featured Soth as a minor character, and though I liked the new people introduced, Ganelon and the Bloody Cobbler,this book should not be advertised under the impression that it is a sequel to Knight of the Black Rose."
5,I loved it...,"This book not only impressed me, but it also got me re-interested in RPG's as a whole. I am a little upset however.. at the end of the book Soth Disappears? I believe to Krynn but I dont know.. there are rumors of a book being out there that places him back in krynn but WHERE! If anyone knows where I can get it LEMME KNOW! Other than that the story line is wonderful and the characters are believable the scripting is as if you are in the book's world all by yourself observing what occurs.. very dramatic 5 stars."
4,Poetic Writing,"Although I prefer first-person narratives that allow for a deeper understanding and connection to a character...this book made up for that in its poetic language filled with beautiful examples of the figurative language we try so hard to teach our students. If you are looking for a book to engage your students while ""reading as a writer"" this is it! It is a literary gem!"
4,"You dropped the bomb online, baby.","Bomberman Online manages to breathe new life into an old formula. I love the new rules and hope they show up elsewhere in the Bomberman series. The online games can be fun when there's no lag, but it feels like this is just too little too late in the life of the Dreamcast. Nonetheless, this is pretty good for one of the last DC games. What can I say? Bomberman Online is, in fact, the bomb. Er, da bomb."
5,A Very Usefull Guide and Reference,"This is the book I have always wanted to have. As a guide and reference, it is perfect. But, if you are new to NT 4, this book may not help you much. It assumes that you are familiar with basic concepts of Windows NT environment."
2,mp3 is not in stereo!,"Don't buy the download (of ""Creating Inner Peace and Calm""). It comes from [...] and sounds watery and is in mono! These excellent Glenn Harrold self-hypnosis recordings rely heavily on directional effects. At least the refund was handled with a quick phone call."
3,Not as good as other Voirst books,"Our 7 year old did not like this books as much as most of this author's books. It was okay, but not great."
2,Not Her Finest,"There wasn't anything special about this book. Sure, it was silly and we can all relate, but is this even sort of memorable? Also, I wasn't a fan of the use of God in this book. I will be teaching my children not to use the name of God in vain so this will contradict that."
4,A good addition to our second home stack,"My husband and I are beginning to collect books related to second homes as we dream about and plan our own great escape. Our favorites are Better Homes and Gardens SECOND HOME, FAMILY HOUSES BY THE SEA, CABIN FEVER, and Better Homes and Gardens COTTAGE STYLE. This book on the Hamptons is our newest purchase, and it has great photos. The best book in terms of combining the dreamy photos with helpful insights to guide our own second home planning, though, is SECOND HOME."
1,Worst movie ever--And that makes it worthwhile!,"This was filmed in my hometown of Kokomo. I was a sophomore in high school at the time. Everyone was all abuzz as we waited for it to premier. Then it premiered. What a waste of everything and everyone who worked on it. My friends and I would always rent it on Halloween and do our own MST3K on it, even before MST3K had been created. The most rediculous part: The 31-minute car chase around the courthouse. It takes only two minutes to drive around it in real-life...and that's hitting all the red lights! The best part: A schoolmate whom no one liked got a minor part--That of a shooting victim. We all cheered when we saw her dead on screen. She got mad at us, but we had a good time. Anyway, don't bother with this movie if you want something with even the slightest bit of substance. It has none. But if you need a good laugh, this movie is for you!"
2,3 silly tales,"Not the best stories I've ever read, certainly. Simpson's ""Wild Honey"" is the worst of the lot with ridiculous names, an unbelieveable heroine, and a very thin plot. Although the premise of Holbrook's ""A Valentine Dream"" is silly, her main characters are strong leads; it's the secondary characters and the ""dream"" that wreck havoc. Raleigh's ""The Merry Cupids"" is the best of the three, thanks to the strong, better developed romantic leads and a plausible plot.If you're looking for something light and don't mind the silliness, this book might be worth a few hours of your time. But if you're looking for something more substantial or a higher quality of writing (especially as concerns the two stories mentioned first), then look elsewhere."
3,good and bad,"So I bought these while looking for ""ultra thin"" socks. They are definately not ultra thin except for two thirds of the top.Also the sizing is off. I wear a size eleven shoe which is suposed to be a size twelve sock. NOPE. These socks were too small and squeezed my feet, very uncomfortable.The cushioning of the sock was very good, even better than the ones that I had bought for my combat boots."
2,Waste of money,Waste of money it was recommended by a sale person for teething for my puppy and she shredded it. Nylabone and antlers worked way better!
4,pretty fun but EXTREMELY HARD!!!,"this is a very hard RPG game...in the beginning you get to choose 3 members to come along with you on your journey, there's tons of different classes to choose from. it's really hard but pretty fun....Note:Buy this if your a RPG master who craves a challenge"
2,Didn't call any squirrels,"Usually my husband and I see a ton of squirrels, and we like to hunt them in our back yard (we have thirty acres of woods). We have used the call on numerous occasions, to the instructions, and we've yet to call in ANY squirrels."
3,Interesting read,A great insight into the suffering of Aboriginal people and a great story of a man who has beaten the odds to come out on top while still maintaining his Indigenous Heritage.
5,How & When to Tell Your Kid's About Sex,"This is an excellent resourse full of practical tips and methods to inform/teach the younger generation about this all important topic. It provides a clear, concise, Godly aspect to the topic! For those who are not of either the Judeo or Christian faith, do not be turned off by the Godly aspect. If you want your children to grow up an enter into marriage with a healthy/positive attitude about sex, this and the God's Design for Sex series are the tools for you. This book is not an easy read. It will require some thought and some time. I'd classify it as a training manual - no pictures, just thought provoking, solid, useful and usable information.This and the companion childrens books will be Christmas gifts for the young families on our Christmas list."
1,Dog Gone,"A customer wrote about this item, and I am glad. Be careful! It's surely true, the supplier does not allow you to choose a color, therefore you think all six collars are $3.99."
2,Fast Shipment.,"Fast shipment! Product was not packaged like original order, 50 to a package, they were loose in the box, making it difficult to determine the total quanity. They were beige, not blue like the picture or like previous orders. The new price of product was 3 times more than before (14.95 to 41.00).$35 shipping cost was also ridiculous!! Would have waited a week or so for slower deliver if less expensive shipping was an option. I may not re-order in the future."
5,"Creative ""Jaws of Life"" in this book of inspiration","22 coaches of creativity provide their insight into delving the mind and spirit for inspiration. Some of this is intellectual; creativity as your spiritual birthright, how to tap the Muses by understanding how the personification of the arts is meaningful. Other advice is the type that writers need--how to write a memoir, getting unstuck, focus and self-awareness.I found this book more aimed to the writer than the visual artist; still, there is a lot of wealth and wisdom here. If you are in any of the creative arts or in business, where creativity is a useful skill in problem-solving, then you ought to have a copy of ""Inspiring Creativity"" on your shelf. It just may get you unstuck someday. Think of it as an emergency ""jaws of life"" for those days when the juices just don't flow."
4,Decent Surge Protector,"Works well with my computer except for the fact it could use more of the transformer outlets on it. Otherwise, its a good product."
4,A very good story about kids.,"I really enjoyed the book. It was a fabulous story.It made me feel happy. The main character Aunt Jessie lived in Bybanks, Kentucky.Their lives seem fun because they lived on a farm.The setting takes place on a farm. All this happened a few years ago.The characters are AuntJessie,Zinny Taylor,UncleNate,Ben,Will,Sam allof them have interesting lives.One of my favorite character is Aunt Jessie shes a person who cares for all her family.She's my favorite character because shes a compassionate ,and very restponsible person.I recomend this book to people from ages 10-13 that like to read about stories that are going to make you smile all the time."
4,Chasing Redbird,"This book says that the people you think are crazy, may just not be you. It says that unpredictable things happen but you can have something you want if you try hard enough, and someone is always watching out for you, whether or not you know it. I'm only 11 but it is so simply written, I can understand the moral."
4,Lashatrell's review,This CD is wonderful. My daughter listens to it all the time and my son's play it for their girlfriends.
5,Much More Helpful Than I Expected,"I purchased this book to use as a guide for students who needed help with industrial-setting report writing. It was a bit more than they needed or could digest at the time. It certainly is a college level text! Since I couldn't easily use it in the work setting I had in mind, I kept it for myself and am glad I did.I particularly have found useful the chapters on the physical preparation of reports, since those are applicable to workbooks, and books and articles as well. The material on research--using email surveys for example--was very helpful and interesting.This is not Report Writing For Dummies! It can be intimidating at first thumb-through. But it is a comprehensive look at an extremely wide variety of writing and presentation situations in business. It would be very helpful for almost any supervisor or manager, or for authors, trainers and teachers."
1,AN OUTDATED PIECE OF JUNK USELESS FOR ACADEMICS,"This edition is ancient, still containing an errata page, and with none of the scholarly apparatus including line numbers and notes from Gödel and God knows what else. It is utterly useless for looking up French quotations found in articles with no way to compare this translation to the French original. And it gives far too much deference to Jacques Derrida whose understanding of Saussure is poor. Can anyone suggest a better English version to get and which French version has the most scholarly apparatus? There seem to be two or three dozen different French editions."
5,A fascinating look at Florida's butterflies.,"As a beginning butterfly gardener in Florida, I found this book to be an essential tool near my window. The beautiful, large photographs always helped me identify the beauties that visit my backyard. The book also helped me identify the eggs, caterpillars and pupas in my garden. The text is also very interesting and includes information about butterfly habits and food. This is a must for anyone who wants to learn more about the butterflies in Florida."
1,piece of crap,"The ear piece is completely worthless. It is completely devoid of any sound quality -- the sound is warped, and you cannot hear.I'm too scared to use the car charger."
4,Science for Early Readers,"This entry in the SIMPLY SCIENCE series brings the topic of electricity into focus. Written on a 2.5 reading level, the information is interspersed with wonderful illustrations, and very inviting. There is a glossary and an index, and a page of references."
4,sweet romance,"The Virgin Bride is Miranda Lee's 51st romance novel. Owing to a crisis of conscience, Dr Jason Steel abandons the prestigious job in a gung-ho bulk-billing Sydney medical practice and Adele, the beautiful, brilliant, sexy doctor he'd been about to marry, for a share in a GP practice in the sedate southern NSW country town of Tindley. And when his patient, elderly sweet shop owner, Ivy Churchill, passes on after succumbing to cancer, he decides that marrying Ivy's niece, Emma, would be a sensible thing to do. He understands that Emma is still in love with the town's bad boy, Dean Ratchitt, even after he betrayed her with another woman, but he decides love is not necessary for a marriage to succeed. But both Emma and Jason have something to learn about trust before they can be happy. Another sweet romance from Miranda Lee."
4,Great beginner book!,"I picked up this book to help with my Routing and Switching class.It focuses strictly on switch functionality, but is a great help. The book is written in such a manner that anyone should be able to understand the concepts, and there are many helpful diagrams.If you are having trouble trying to wrap your head around bridge/switch functionality, then you should give this a try. I feel it is much better than some of the more dry, high-concept texts that are out there."
4,Suprisingly Good,"I picked this book up from a second hand book store for something to read on the train into work. Well I could not put this book down until I finished it. The book has the intrigue and action of the film 'Seige' without the marshal Law . The teacher who gets framed, the students blaming him, the FBI being the FBI. Lastly the parents not wanting the teacher in the vicinty of their children. He has to find the real bomber before he loses self control and his own life."
4,"Intrigue, Action, all around great suspense story","Peter Blauner has a great writing ability to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. The story tells a tale of mistakes and hatred. It all starts out when a boy named Nasser bombs a school bus and a teacher is a main suspect for the case, and then he is blamed for it, and he's searching for the truth. If you like action books that are really and keep you on the edge of your seat, this is for you. BUY IT!"
5,Blauner Keeps Getting Better And Better,"Two of Blauner's earlier works--Slow Motion Riot and The Intruder-- were excellent books. Both of which read like thrillers but are really great, adrenaline-pumping fiction. Consistent with these past successes, Blauner's latest, Man Of Honor, is another must-read and may be his best yet. If you like exciting well-written stories with well-developed and memorable characters--and who doesn't?-- rush out and buy Man Of Honor when it comes out in April. While you're at it, do yourself a favor and pick up copies of Slow Motion Riot and The Intruder as well"
3,"Important indeed, but rather fuzzy","Turners message, that social science would benefit from a closer integration with cognitive science, is an important one, and is easy to agree with. On the other hand, it is not a particularly original point to make. You will find it more clearly stated and better argued in E. O. Wilson ""Consilience"" or S. Pinker ""The Blank Slate"".I find this book rather fuzzy when it comes down to the details. What exactly is the state of contemporary cognitive science? What theories of social science would we have to discard when we take this research into account? What would this integration mean for modelling and testing? Turner is quite neubolus on questions like these, and offers surprisingly few references to neurobiological studies. He does not care to present too much evidence in support for his theories. I expected more rigour from this book, honestly."
2,WOBBLES!!! Not sturdy enough for the price!,"I bought this for my 86 pound lab because he injured his knee and I didn't want him jumping on and off my bed. He might have used it if it were steadier, but it wobbles so much that he quite reasonably doesn't trust it to put his weight on it. He would nudge it out of the way rather than try to use it. For the price I paid I expected something made a little better. Very disappointed and am returning it. Might be fine for smaller dogs or cats because it is the right height for a taller bed, but I would not recommend this for big dogs."
4,Feel good album of the summer,"I picked this disc up thanks to several reviews. Spot on. Hailing from Northeast Ohio, it is hard to have a laid back summer vibe due to our bad weather. Putting this disc into your car and driving makes a laid back vibe no amount of sunshine can offer. If you like positive, melodic hip hop, cop this disc now. Get in your car, put the windows down, and play track 14."
2,Worth the read?,"I was disappointed in this book. I really enjoyed the first two books in this series. I feel Mindy Starns Clark got lost in this novel. There are just too many things happening. Things I was bored by and found farfetched. I found myself reading the last few pages to see if the book was worth finishing. I never read the end early! The end was good, but the rest of the book did little to hold my interest. I am, however, excited to see where the author will take this series. I feel the series concept is original. The mystery and faith woven in these books is something needed in Christian fiction."
5,Excellent Italian Cookbook,"Simply Tuscan is a wonderful book that captures one of Italy's finest exports -- their food. The Italian lifestyle is defined in their cooking, and in this book that pairs recipe with occassion. The format is organized by season, so you can easily select dishes to compliment the day. The recipes are simple to prepare. The menu combinations are excellent. Simply Tuscan is a wonderful continuation of Luongo's earlier cookbook - A Tuscan in the Kitchen.A Tuscan in the Kitchen: Recipes and Tales from My Home"
1,pre-historic,"What a waste of $30. This seller needs to quit selling this item, its a decade old, it doesn't tell you anything about digital printing you don't know...Gosh it's 2011"
2,Simple beginner's book...,This book is a simple regurgitation of the information you could find in a Carleton Sheets program. Good thing is that it is much cheaper. Don't expect a real detailed plan or anything close.
3,"Great hydrating cream, but not for keratosis pilaris","This is the first time trying this cream...I specifically bought this to treat keratosis pilaris, which it didn't clear it up at all. I think I will stick to kp duty for keratosis pilaris."
5,Excellent Product,"If you have seriously dry skin, this is the creme for you. Best results if applied directly, within minutes for getting out of the shower or bath."
4,great moisturizer,worked pretty well. My skin is not as bumpy as it was. Haven't found a product yet that has worked as well for me.
5,Amazing healing!!!,"This is miracle cream. It has healed the cracked hands and feet of three family members. I have searched for anything to help my severely cracked heels and extremely dry hands since I was a child. This did wonders within two days of using it. My husband had the same results on his knuckles. They had cracked open from dry weather. There was a huge improvement after only three aplications.Do not be scared off by the price. If you have seriously dry skin, it is worth every penny. Only a small amount of cream is needed for each application. This tube is going to last a long time.The other AmLactin products are very good too. But, I have never had results like this from any product before."
1,this cd sucks,Thi cd sucks it don't have 2 of the best songs from the movie and some songs that are not in the movie.so don't wast your money I personaly am going to take my cd shred it and mail it to fox and ask for my money back.
1,Use amazon.co.uk to get the good stuff,Yea i was just like all of you guys buying the US soundtrack and realizing it sucks.Goto amazon.co.uk and you can get the good version.(...)
1,"Yo yo yo yo, Holla!","Read the track list before you buy. The American version is the Hip-hop version.If you're looking for the track that plays during the ""Bank robbery car chase"" search LIMEWIRE or BitTorrent for 'DJ Pone' or 'The Chase'. If you want the track during the big fight scene in the bus garage search for 'DJ Pone' or 'Fighting Man'. Also check out DJ Pone showcasing his shiz in the group ""Birdy Nam Nam"". I think Amazon has the album or go to www.BirdyNamNam.com.Pone's 2 tracks made the movie for me. Everything else I heard was just disposable hip-hop noise. You can also check www.amazon.co.uk (Amazon in the United Kingdom). I believe that they have a different soundtrack for this same movie.Yeah, I'm a freeloading, downloading, scumbag... but I can't seem to find these tracks anywhere else."
3,Works somewhat,"I use this shampoo a few times a week. The other times I use my prescription Selenium Sulfide shampoo. The prescription does stop the itching, but is not much of a shampoo, so I use the Aubrey proeduct in conjunction with it.It's so hard to pinpoint what helps with the itchy scalp, so I can't say that this product is a home run, but it seems quite pleasant and gentle."
4,Cute shoes,"This is a cute shoe, I have the patent and the light gold. It runs very narrow. I had to exchange and order 1/2 size larger, once they are broken in, they are more comfortable."
1,No fan,"This was an expensive treat I ordered, refrigeration really jacked up the price. As well as I like more traditionally preserved anchovies, I did not care for these in vinegar. Too strong for my tastes."
3,"Ok to fill an afternoon, but nothing mind-blowing.","Jack of all games is a good name, because you get jack of their games pretty fast. This game had alot of potenial. Viking legends and characters and an exciting history. The game is ok. It's alot of killing, slashing and hacking and for the most part seems to have no reason behind it. I like hack and slash games. But I like some reason for it. That's why I enjoyed the Medal of honour games. They are basiclly shoot everything but I like the missions. The character is a little tricky to control at times and if you are having trouble it will really annoy you. The sound is ok but the speech is excellent and probobly the best part of the game. The graphics are just a little clearer than the PSX so they have a long way to go. I would be wary of buying any Jack of all games titles. But maybe worth a rent."
1,Rune: Viking Warlord,"I cannot believe I spent the money for this game. This is a gamers worst fear to buy a game like this one. A friend told me of a Viking game on a PC that was totally awesome and said it was a must buy. He must of meant some other Viking game called Rune: Viking Warlord cause this game was awful not awesome. The loading time, the crazy controls, the lack of a descent story are all reasons to avoid this title like the black plague. I mean it - the only reason I gave it one star is cause that was the worst I could. The best thing about this title is the time it gives you while it is loading. For instance you could clean your room, walk your dog, mow the lawn, paint the house, wash your car, and even sleep in the amount of time it takes between each level. This is really an awful title. Sorry if you already bought it."
1,THIS GAME BLOWS,this is the worst game ive ever layed my hands on! you start off doing your training in some stupid place. the controls on this game are horrible and the storyline is worse. i havent gone past the 2nd level because i just cant bear to play the game much longer.
1,Do not waste your time,"I made the huge mistake of buying something without doing a little homework. Rune has awful control, poor graphics, and is generally a complete waste of time and money. I'm so embarrassed from buying this game, I filed it. There are too many great fight games on the market to bother with this."
1,terrible game,"First of all this game is overpriced for its value. You always do the same things and there are only a few attacks. There are different weapons but they aren't much different. The only difference is that some weapons don't do much damage, some do. The attacks for each weapon looks exactly the same. This game is a waste of money. DO NOT BUY IT."
4,not bad,"the biggest pro of this game is the concept of norse vikings and all. the scenery is real cool. the ""battle"" or fighting isnt complicated but not too simple. so thats ok too. the controle [is bad], graphics are ok, and the sound is great. my biggest problem is that its so easy to get lost with no freakin clue what your doing. a few hints but nothing real helpfull. the biggest challenge is to not kill yourself trying dumb sh$t to make it through the level. all and all once you find out where your going, whats going on, and make it through the loading times, its a fun game."
5,Great book,"Great book! She goes pretty in depth for such a thin book. Good book for serious racers looking for pure technique related material. No frills. Only drawback was that it's written more for coaches working with younger skiers. Pictures are mostly of kids. That's OK though, This lady knows her business."
5,Look no further - this little guide will do you just fine!,"Very nice concise hockey primer. Would make a good reference for an older kid or for any fan of the sport. Clear explanations provide condensed info that is readily accessible to anyone. It needs another run through for me (for non fiction I often have to read multiple times). I also haveHockey For Dummiesand, to me, this little book is actually as good if not better. HFD is larger and the text is laid out in such a way (as are all dummy books) that it is actually much less texty than it appears. Ice Hockey Made Simple really is just that - simplified but thorough coverage. Highly recommended!"
4,ice hockey made simple,"well writen, however it's somehat outdated. It's easy yo understand, but from what little I know about ice hockey, some of the rules have changed."
1,A snapshot of bad 3D action adventure from a bygone era,"This is a classic example of a direction games avoided. A perfect snapshot of failed ideas in the early 3D eras. It makes the complaints about camera and control in modern 3D action games seem like nitpicking, as Urban Chaos is all but unplayable with its set up.Even basic functions like jumping, or punching are so poorly mishandled, it makes you wonder if the developers were really thinking they had something cool, or simply going through the motions w/ a limited skill set and lack of funding."
3,It was Great,"This book was ok. It was sort of slow but then It picked up. Some chapters I wished I could skip them but I still read on. This book is a great book over all. I will say this though, I think and middle school student would like it."
3,Too big for one person,I rarely use mine since I purchased it because 8 quarts is too huge for one person.
3,great book,"No spoilers!! This book was really great,It always kept me in suspense! Silver fin was 1 of the best books i ever read!"
3,Didn't quite cut it,"This book was okay, but it wasn't exactly the thriller I thought it would be. It annoyed me how perfect James was: smart, tall, athletic, handsome... you get the drift. This could have been a lot better, it got boring (and predictable!) at some points. I'm not sure what I expected, but somehow I couldn't quite imagine this kid growing up to be Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan..."
2,Silverfin,"A nice idea of having young Bond and I can see the potential market. However the story was poorly written and in the past. The modern Bond of toady had to have been born in the late sixties. This bond was born in 1920 si the stuff is old. Yet the author writes about computers in the 1960's. They did not have them then, The villain is good,but when you think we are talking about children or teenagers not real."
1,"The ""humor"" just doesn't fly","I fully realize that I cannot honestly give an accurate review of the book's content, since I didn't get past the first twenty or so pages; but for me the constant goofball humor was just way too distracting. I found myself annoyed more often than informed, and it became unreadable. Too bad I started underlining or I would have offered it up for sale. This guy may indeed know his stuff, but the way the information is presented is rather juvenile. If corny jokes help you learn, then by all means buy this book. But be warned!"
1,Stand up comedian tries his hand at writing and fails,"Lots of reviews of this book refered to Rod's writing style as entertaining. What a joke. This book is a big disappointment. His attempts at humor seem to be the main point of the book and more often then not they are neither funny nor illuminating. In fact these constant clumsy attempts to lighten up an otherwise serious subject are a big distraction. It was so bad that I couldnt stand to read past the first few chapters...touture. If you have ever witnessed a comedian bomb on stage, this is what it reads like in aviation journals. Its that bad. rc"
5,Rod Machado's Private Pilot Handbook,"A very, very, excellent book for students, or pilots of yesterday, and the Flight Simulator enthusiasts. Having difficulty understanding some subjects such as VOR or Radio Navigation, ADF's, DME's, use of Radio Comm gear, Transponders, Gyros/instruments, Flight Planning, Radio communications, use of the flight calculator [better than the manufacturer's instructions], understanding flight charts, Air Space manuevering, etc.? This is a book you cannot afford to miss. It contains good color photographs of flight charts or maps which are a poor display as photocopies in other manuals allowing you to really see and catch on to details. And Amazon.com now makes their ordering forms simple with a push button and mailing to you right away. Amazon is great!Thus when the little lady, your wife, tells you to go fly a kite, pick up Rod's book and go fly a plane. That is how Rod managed to write this book...his little lady sent him to fly a kite often."
4,"Generally good, could use a few improvements","Rod Machado has good illustrations, explains concepts and airplane parts well, and gives a lot of solid practical advice. However, he could do a better job of piecing together the tidbits of advice for a more smooth presentation of the techniques involved in the basic maneuvers the beginner must absorb. Also, summaries of the crucial information (perhaps at the end of the sections) would have been very helpful since it seems to get mixed in with a lot of the less-than-crucials. Less importantly, the book could use hard covers due to its large size :-)"
4,Great Information for those who aren't in a hurry,"I found Rod's style to be humorous and helpful. However, he does tend to be pretty wordy. I found a great combination to be Gleim's test prep book and this one.The Gleim books give you the bare minimum of information, very quickly. Then for the places I needed more meat... this book was the perfect source--It explains things in a couple of different ways so if one of them doesn't do it for you, one of the others should.In fact, I still use it when I need something explained in english. It was a great addition to my library."
3,"it's ok, not that exciting","i got this game for my kiddo to reinforce her spanish. it's not very exciting however. you choose which rocket you want, they are pretty much the same, and then you shoot the answer to the math question. randomly little hard to see rocks fall from the sky to kill you. not very exciting. but at least it's in spanish!"
2,It only lasted two days....,Great concept....bad durability.....worked great for two days....but you must understand...when the joy stick breaks...it renders the whole! game...useless!!!....but I only payed $9.99 for mines...so I got what i paid for....i just feel sorry for the people who paid a lot! more...when this thing first came out....atleast i got a book! out the deal...the kids were sad that it know longer worked...me too....so sad to bad the company could not build this product better...it could have became a ....must have for your kids type product.Maybe they'll redo it in the future and give us all who got the shaft!.... a discount! on the newer model.
2,Broke after 1 month's use,"My 2 1/2 year old son liked this toy and even though some of the games included were over his head, he still liked to try. Unfortunately, the video game connection broke, and we've only opened it a month ago. We are all disappointed and will probably buy him a V-Smile instead."
3,"Sounds good, but not many options and kind of a pain","We just got this as a gift. Like other reviews, there really aren't a lot of books available for this. The regular story reader stuff does not work with this and there are only 3 books available for the video one. I just ordered the other ones hoping that will improve the experience. The book it comes with is pretty lame.The book itself is a cool design, but comes out easily.The cable and video control has a great compartment, but you really have to remember how it goes back in. That can take a while.The video game is kind of hard for a kid. My son never played video games before, so he really can't get it. It may have to resurface in a couple years there. Until then, he want to see it, but just can do himself.Hopefully once he sees it with characters he know, he will like the book part of it better.Swing and a miss."
3,Extreme G3 Critique,"Well here's another solid racing game for the PS2. Personally I enjoy fantasy racing and this game definitely did the trick. But as is the case with many games play value becomes an issue. This game definitely has play value but not enough of it. Once you buy all the weapons and upgrades, you have nothing to do. The game could use more of the above. And would it hurt to slow down the game a little? This game is definitely not for beginning gamers. The controls are tricky and the weapons icons hard to see. My advice stick with GT3. That's it from me. I'm out :)"
5,A game worthy to share a system with GT3,"What makes XG3 so appealing? Driving a futuristic motorcycle at speeds over 700 mph? Being able to use weapons? The beautiful tracks and gut-wretching drops, turns, twists, and loops? Perhaps the weather effects and exhaust flare add a bit?I think all of them come together perfectly to make XG3 the best high-speed racer available today. And, since it isn't known whether PS2's Wipeout will make it state-side, this game may serve to sate a great deal of racing fans' desires.It's difficult to say one thing that stands out in this game. Everything is top-notch. If there is a hindrance, it's in the cityscape when it's raining; there is some minor slow-down, but it's temporary and doesn't affect gameplay.If you need a racer to fill in after GT3's completion, here's a title for you. Worth every penny, too."
4,Good book if you have been through a program that uses Core Mapping.,"I went through Pathways in Dallas (awesome, life changing, but that is another review) that used Core Mapping and wanted a review of this material after the program was over. This book is great for understanding the Core Map system and learning more of who you are."
3,"management, theory and practice","An introduction to the theory and practice of management, . some of the topics discussed include women in management, dealing with employees relations, modern approaches to management, ethical aspects, personal effectiveness and managerial competencies."
4,Diabolique,I rented this movie years ago and loved it. I decided to buy it for my girlfriend and she loved it as well. The images were crisp and very clear. I can tell that Criterion must have performed some restoration work on it. I love the old style of horror movie where the fear is based upon the mystery and suspense and not the blood and guts. This is the old style (old school) that I like most and highly recommend it.
5,Nicely aged creamy goat cheese,"When I got back from Paris I thought I would be able to find some good goat cheese at specialty shops, but all I could find was the tubs of goat cheese that haven't been aged and basically just tasted a little different than cream cheese.This goat cheese really reminded me of the stuff I could get in paris. Leave it out for 30 minutes and put it on some toasted baguette and it makes a great snack, or even a meal with a salad, tomatoes, and wine. You can really tell it has been aged by the flavor especially near the white rind. I got the presidente stuff in paris that was in little log shapes with a white rind, which was really good, but I think this is even better. Bon appetit!"
3,Needs a good editor,"This is great material but is poorly written. I am a research scientist, and a literate English speaker. I found the exposition often crammed together with a poor logical flow. Tables, graphs and diagrams and microphotographs are not used often. They would have been quite useful to any visually oriented readers.I think that additional editing by a physical scientist would have encouraged better exposition of the authors ideas. The use of friends and colleagues in the similar fields as the author creates an inbred editorial perspective that has failed to maximize the value of this book."
1,From the Title through the chapter headings all Hype no real substance,"This book is a good example of what the major publishing houses are resorting to. Put their money into catchy Book Titles and chapter headings but let us down by shorting us on substance and thought provoking content. This is a badly done review of poorly understood literature. There is nothing to this book that is either new or interesting and definitely nothing that will keep you awake except the nagging thought of why did I wast good money on this drivel? Take the chance to ""take a look inside"" and read some of it before you buy....What I should have done."
5,Worth the effort,"Lane's clear and elegant writing nevertheless inspires a lot of us readers to use the word ""dense"" -- not as in ""thickheaded"" but as in ""densely argued."" There's a lot of information packed into every sentence. Not having much background in biology, I found I had to pay extremely close attention and sometimes read a passage twice. On the other hand, I rarely found myself needing to look up a word or go to another source for a simpler background explanation. The author is quite skilled at getting across difficult material even to the layman. And what a reward for the serious mental effort that's required to follow him! He opens door after door. I've read several of Lane's books now, and I'm prepared to buy and read anything he writes from now on. Until I began to read his books, I never even thought to regret that I hadn't studied more biology. This would be a fine gift for a young student, or for any autodidact later in life. ""Your Inner Fish"" is another good one."
3,third time is a charm,"I ordered this drive belt and they sent me the deck belt, so I Called them and told them. they said they would correct the problem, and they sent me another deck belt. I called them again and they said they WOULD correct the problem, and they did the third time is a charm.ps. they were always super nice about fixing the problem."
2,Not leather lined,"It's very cute but I'm not happy because I was expecting it to be all leather (inside & out) it was misrepresented on the website. $43 plus $10 shipping, not worth it."
5,Wonderful and very useful book,"My family spent 2 weeks in Yellowstone, Grand Teton's and Jackson Hole, Wy in June 2005. We purchased this book months prior to our visit, highlighted the ""MUST DO'S"" and scratched off things we were not interested in--long hikes. This wonderul book helped us plan our trip so that we got the most for our time and money. I would like to see more resturant info but it was a very nice tool to have. If you get to Gardner, Montana this book recommends a 'hole-in-the-wall' resturant called Hateful Helen's. The book says 'not much to look at but wonderful food' and we agree! Best hamburgers you've ever eaten. We had a wonderful vacation. Thanks Frommers!"
3,"Poor quality, but replaced at no charge","We have had two of these mattresses for just over a year and BOTH have tears in them. Our children do nothing but sleep on them and barely weigh 20 pounds. The tears are huge!By providing pictures, the tag and sticker from mattress, they replaced both in a very quick manner!"
4,Mattress seems good... we will see when Baby actually arrives,"We purchased the DaVinci Twilight 6' foam mattress because of reading excellent reviews on other sites. There was only one on Amazon when we decided to buy this mattress. It arrived in a timely manner wrapped in just plastic, as some of the other reviews had stated. I was concerned about this at first, but the plastic was heavy duty and the mattress was also wrapped inside in a thinner plastic. There does not seem to be any damage or dirt on the mattress. It fits perfectly in our DaVinci Kalani Crib, which is good as this is one of the mattresses recommended for it. So far it seems to be a good mattress, though one side of the mattress in one corner appears to be a bit sunken in. We will see how the mattress really works once our Baby arrives in August and can try it out. I will repost more information at that time."
1,Does not fit the DaVinci Emily Crib,"Please note, while this product says the dimensions are 53 x 33 x 6 inches they are in fact 53 x 27 x 6 inches. This is a standard size mattress and does not fit the wider DaVinci Emily Crib. It creates a gap on the sides where an infant can become trapped and suffocate. Please do not buy this mattress for a DaVinci Emily Crib.I realized this after receiving this product. The mattress itself is not a bad mattress, but I gave it 1 star because it was not at all as described. I am not only disappointed but I am frustrated to know that this product is being incorrectly advertised, as this could create a SIDS risk for parents who don't notice the gap."
1,This is NOT what I ordered,"It says this was the mattress I ordered (buy the Davinci crib, get this mattress with it free). However, I opened the package and aired it out in the garage without thinking. A couple months later when we were ready for the baby to sleep in it I looked and realized the mattress shown is NOT what we ordered. This one says 100% polyster. However, I got one that is 100% vinyl cover (which is being phased out due to being unsafe, leaching chemicals!)"
4,Good Book,Mr.Mosley has a touch about him that comes off in this book really well through out.alots of twists&turns here keeps your full attention.worth checking into.after i saw Devil in a blue dress i had to check out his work.his Books have more juice than the film.
1,stinky,I DID NOT LIKE THE COLOR THAT THIS PRODUCT LEFT YOUR SKIN IT'S MORE ORANGE THAN TAN AND IT STREAKS NOT A EVEN APPLICATIONS ALSO SMELLS AFTER PRODUCT DRIES.SHOULD OF KNOWN NOT TO TRY IT DID THE SAME THING LAST TIME WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN.
5,Natural looking self tanner,"These Tan Towels are amazing! One towel does my face and body. The product dries super quick and smells nice. In a couple of hours I have a very nice, natural looking tan. I took them traveling recently, no worries about something spilling.I will only be buying Tan Towels from now on."
5,Life saver,"I used tan towels for my February destination wedding. I am fair skinned and have lots of freckles. I considered spray tanning but then I heard about tan towels. I tested the tan towels a few weeks before my wedding and found that it enhanced my skin color in a very natural way without any streaking or splotches. I applied tan towels twice just before my wedding and felt like I looked glowing. They are really easy to use, especially if you have someone to wipe the towels on hard to reach areas."
3,A very underrated artist,"""Beat"" is simply one of the best electronic compositions of all times: edgy, highly evocative, full of expression. Carter's interest in Berlin School electronics permeates the whole album and his Roland System 100 is unforgettable. A very, very underrated artist, this album deserves a good DVD reedition containing complete 90 min. cassette original version. If you are a true fan of electronics stick to this UK temperamental pioneer, is a must. Congratulations to Mute Records for these Industrial Records reeditions. Let's crack a tinnie!"
5,Great CD,"Needed this CD to complete my collection for the 80's. Great sound. As usual, Time Life does a great job of remastering the sound. Brings back a lot of memories."
1,the worse digimon game ever,way do i think its the worse becuse it is so boring .now if you want cool digimon game get digimon world 2 or digmon rumble arena.
3,good game but hard to get the hang of,This is a good game for any digimon fan really. The only flaws are its too hard to get the hang of doing so much stuff in one turn. And the voices are from Digimon World 1. Overall a pretty good game but i only had it for 3 days cause i rented it so i didnt really get to play much.
5,BEAUTIFUL!,I absolutely fell in love with this film from the second I heard the concept. I have watched many crappy quality versions of this film to sate my addiction and am ecstatic that it is finally on DVD. I would prefer Blu-ray but it's a small price to pay for such a wonderful film. LOVE LOVE LOVE
5,Elvis & Annabelle,"Great Movie!!! This is definitely a chick flick...I dont remember this in the theater...but if I had known about it, I would have paid to see it more than once. Glad I found it on Amazon!!!"
5,A nice surprise!,"I happened on to this movie yesterday on Lifetime. Decided to check it out for a couple of moments before I was going to turn the channel. To my surprise, I was immediately hooked. This is such an unexpected beautiful and endearing movie. It touches on so many levels of humanity. I loved it so much and can not believe I never even heard anything about it. How could such a great story (movie) like this go unnoticed, maybe it is going to be one of those soon to be cult films. It really is a special movie that everyone can fully enjoy of all age groups. I even now have it on my wish list and can not wait until it is released in October."
3,It's ok,"Image quality is superb, but I thought it would be smaller. If you don't mind having a keychain much bigger than your keys you should by this one."
1,His death,"It's not really what I expected. It is mostly base on his death than when he was alive. There is a big part of his memorial service in it. I was expecting more of his works, his personality things like that. Although, they spoke about his life, but it was too brief. I personaly wanted more of him alive then dead. As MJ's fans you can always support his estate by bying it, but I just give you an idea of what to expect."
4,Correction,"Please note: The Title of the book is not God AND the People Israel, as Amazon currently reads, but God IN the People Israel. This is a crucial distinction as Wyschogrod wants to argue that Israel has a corporate and corporeal or incarnational sense of its relation to God that need not be expressed in the Aristotelian language of Christian doctrine.The book is, as another reviewer wrote, written with clarity and thought. It is important to know that Wyschogrod pulls no punches with respect to Christianity. He admires the Christian theologian Karl Barth, and like Barth does not shy away from frank criticisms, some of which extend to Jesus, Paul, and Christianity in general. This makes for a lively read that should alert Christians to the idea that something is at stake in these discussions."
3,pass the medicine,"sue ann is no stranger to music. this is actually her junior release.yes its true. in the early 80's she had an album on the warner label with two small hits noteworthy:Let me let you rock me and company. even though this album is overall well balanced and mature, the songs dont stand out and grab you like they do on the blue velvet album (her second). Best picks her are :sex or love,the dark side of love, here 4 U, and I'll give you love (which was also a single on the sophomore release). p.s. her mom is the disco diva joi carwell so the talent is in the genes."
1,Pretty but not practical,"Not durable for simple every-day use standing on it doing dishes at the sink. Not ""Stain and Fade Resistant"" as advertised. It's two layers put together and the top layer where the image is eventually peeled away from the ""cushioned"" part. It also attracts fur and dirt because of whatever fabric the top part is is like velcro, so don't get if you have pets. It stained worse than any other mat I have ever used at the kitchen sink, spot cleaning made it worse and you certainly can't toss it in the washing machine. Very disappointed with this mat."
4,Good introduction to wrestling.,"This book is very good for the beginner wrestler. All of the basics are covered along with a little bit of strategy. This book would also be very good for students of Karate and striking arts to learn basic ground moves like positioning, takedowns, wrist control, using weight, etc."
2,A 2 year old can beat this game,I bought this game at noon. I went home and within two hours I beat the game twice. This game has no challenge what so ever. I never even read the directions. This game may be good for younger kids but older player will walk right through this game. I sold it to Funcoland two hours after i bought it because there was just no challenge to the game. very disapointing for any huge wrestling fan.
2,WWF in a street fighting rescue game,"This is one of the WWF's latest games, and you can tell because the WWF has branched off into different genres, and this includes its video games. Betrayal an old school street fighting ""beat-em up"" type game that goes along the lines of Double Dragon and Final Fight. A genre in which for five years has been dead. The game itself is cartoonish, so is the plotline and difficulty! You can chose from four superstars to play as to capture the WWF title and rescue Stephanie McMahon. Another fun thing about this game is the details, you can pick up weapons to beat the thugs, and destroy cars, desks, tables and anything else. If you are over 7 years old, I would consider this a total blunder of a game. Otherwise, it is a quick challenge of six levels for any seven year-old."
4,X-Men : Savage Land,"This series features the original characters, the original team, in all-new adventures drawn and told in a manner reminiscent of the Silver Age era but incorporating some of the more sophisticated storytelling techniques adopted since then. Perfect for older nostalgists without interfering the current timeline. Plus, it's a good read that current X-fans curious about the X-Men's earlier days can enjoy too."
3,Uknown benfit,Have not been taking ICaps long enough to see any inprovement.About 2 weeks for Macular degenirationPrice is high enough
4,An Exercise in Character Development,"""Laidanwe,"" Tlelai said, ""The one who brings what must come."" Gabriel looked at him. ""Harbinger,"" he said.That just made my heart skip a beat, as I truly knew that the character that I have grown to love in the past 700 pages or so, has begun to develop into a real human being.Duane has a real knack of bringing character to life, giving them personalities that make them just jump out of the page and into your imagination. It's like their real people.Storm is an excellent new installment of the Harbinger trilogy. In it, we meet new characters and see the reoccurence of many old ones, as well as a nice way to show first contact with an alien species that communicates, shall we say, ""strangely"" at best.My only gripe is that there are a few sections where Connor spends too much time milling over ideas and thoughts in his head... a bit more action would make the book sizzle!"
1,Not worth the money,"I have been playing Half-Life on my computer since version 1.0 came out and let me tell you this, this is just another case of an absoluetly excelent PC game gone bad on a console. With out a doubt, it's not worth the money to buy a PS2 game. I suguest that if you are interested in getting Half-Life and its subsequent mods you buy the PC version and go to planethalflife dot com and check out the mods. It's much much better on PC."
4,"Highly enjoyable, fun music, with little repetition.","I had never heard of Bunny before I got this cd, and I was pleasantly surprised. The first some is what sold me, it's called `Trees' and it's just wonderful. This is a really nice selection of his work, and probably the best of all his career. I recommend this album if you like old time big band stuff, or just want to hear what a good old musician sounds like."
4,P D James,I like all of the P.D.James movies. I especially like Adam Dagliesh played by Ray Marston.
3,book review,I wouldn't give it as a gift. The book itself doesn't have a cover and it looks a little worn.
3,Too Much Smoking!,"I was repulsed by the much smoking. I grew up in the 1940's and 50's and I never saw the like. An otherwise good series ruined by the excessive smoking. This reminded me of the ""Deadwood"" series and the much cursing in it. I bought all three seasons of ""MadMen"" and stopped watching after the first episode in season one."
3,jury still out...,"one of these days i will figure out what's up with Mad Men. It's O.K. for TV drama, but c'mon, people, it's not THAT great."
1,Region error!,"Unfortunately, I can't properly review MadMen #2; I can't view the Dvds I received. because I live in Australia (a Region4 DVD zone)& the product I received is a USA/ Canada Region 1 item, which won't play on my DVD - I've returned it for a refund"
5,Best tv series ever!!,"I started watching Mad men during its second season after hearing raves about it from friends and relatives. I am in my seventies and can say without equivocation that this is the best tv series ever. I do not let any show become a must-see, except perhaps Masterpiece Theater. However I eagerly awaited Sunday evenings and was sorry to see season three end. This is the first series I have ever purchased and enjoy watching it. The acting is superb and the writing is beyond excellent.The scenes and depiction of the fifties and sixties is so true. As a college student in the late fifties on the east coast, I know those places, attitudes and yes even the clothes. So authentic. The price at Amazon was reasonable. If you want good theatre, get this series. Nostalgia, drama, even humor, Kudos to Matthew Weiner et all. Award worthy."
3,mad at mad men,"As a new fan of Mad Men, I orderd this set to catch up on season 2. One of the discs from the set kept freezing and I had to play around with the remote, rewind, reverse, etc till I was able to get it right. Three of the discs were perfect."
2,Season One was a lot better than Season Two.,"In Season One, both Don Draper and Peggy Olson have a strong story arc. We get to know Don better through his long-lost brother. And we see Peggy rise from secretary to copywriter. What do we get in Season Two? Almost nothing. Don is back to his old tricks and that's about it. Oh...and he's against dropping the Mohawk Airlines account for the American Airlines account. Really riveting stuff there. And Peggy. Now that she's a copywriter, it seems like the writers didn't know what to do with her during Season Two. I guess the best you can say about her is that she gives free advice to the priest on public speaking. Again--really riveting stuff there. It seemed like Season Two focused more on the supporting characters, such as Sal, Ken and Paul. But why spend so much time with the supportining characters and not enough time with the leads? This was the problem with Season Two and one of the reasons why it was boring. Not recommended."
4,Exquisite Period ART,"The 60's are often hailed as an amazing era of change and excitement. Our parents were young men and women during these times. The series is impeccably stylized, so true to its Era down to the very last detail & idiom. Social and work norms are captured artfully and at times disturbingly so.When watching it , I feel like I'm voyuering through a time machine and peeking into deep intimate life details.I become so captivatingly immersed in its ""aura of ERA"" , the very way you would respond if it were a priceless piece of ART!The enigmatic reality of people's personalities, at a time in history when people did not show you their cards and bare all on TV, but kept a stoic facade up to show strength, resolve and sexual charisma....Wow!!Yes, plot lines are not always very engaging and neither is character empathy present much either. Its the crftfully woven mystery of art that keeps you coming back, time after time!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!,"This capo is not the best. It doesnt have enough spring to it, so when i put it on my guitar it makes this buzzing sound. I dont recomend buying!"
1,cRapo,"A piece of garbage. There is not enough power in the spring to clamp sufficiently and as a result the top two strings are muted while other strings buzz. It's not worth the frustration, get a better capo."
3,Good product,"sounds great for the size, bluetooth connection works perfectly and setup is very easy. The magnet in the back is a plus. I attached it to the IV pole in the OR and listen to music and answer my phone calls all in one unit. I wish the charge connector in the back was tighter, I guess it was my unit that the jack does not plug in tightly so the unit does not charge unless I place it in a certain position to make the connection tight."
1,Kodak Li-ion Rechargeable Batter/KLIC 7001,"I have only just put the new battery into my camera, but it is not charging, I can only take a photo while the camera is charging on the power, but this may not be the fault of the battery it may be my camera is at fault. You may know if this would be the problem or not. But thought I would just tell you this as you sent me the email review your purchase."
5,Li-ion battery,"The battery arrived in good shape, and it is what I needed! I don't think it is availalbe in stores anymore!"
4,Chu complete,"This CD in the Chronological Classics series issues all of Chu's releases under his own leadership. The best session is the first one he made for Commodore in 1938 with Roy Eldridge on trumpet. Both men play at their best on this date. Almost as good is the Columbia/Variety date of September 1937 that had Irving Randolph on trumpet; this session includes the famous ""Chuberry jam."" Chu had a big tenor sound with roots in the Coleman Hawkins school. He died in a car wreck shortly after the last session on this disc was made--a great loss to jazz. Recommended."
5,Feeling down? Pop in this movie for a good laugh!,I rented this movie on DVD for two reasons 1)It had a standard poodle in it (I have a black one myself) and 2) I liked Parker Posey from her As the World Turns days. I enjoyed the movie MUCH more than I expected. It is a great satire on Dog Shows and particularly the dog owners. After watching the movie my husband and I watched it with the commentary and enjoyed it even more after learning all the behind the scenes stuff.
3,Dog-umentary,"This movie is a spoof on those who consider showing dogs as one of the more important facets of life. It follows 5 different couples (two of whom are gay) and details the preparations they go through before an important dog show. ""Little League Dads"" and ""Pom-pom Moms"" have nothing on these strange characters who are literally living through their dogs. This is as dysfunctional a group as you could imagine and the jokes are sometimes funny, but more often they fall a bit flat. This is good for a few chuckles, but is not as funny as the promos would have you believe."
3,Not as Good as Guffman,"Maybe I went in with unreasonable expectations...Waiting for Guffman, a movie that shares essentially the same cast & writers as Best in Show, is one of the absolute funniest comedies ever. This second effort, though laugh-out-loud funny in parts, just doesnt reach that same plateau. It could be that too many sub-par scenes had to be added to the movie to give it a feature film length. Too much screen time is given to the hotel manager & dog-show organizer, leading to large stretches of film devoid of comedy. Dont get me wrong, parts of this movie really fly! Christopher Guest & Eugene Levyy are brilliant. Catherine O'Hara does excellent work as well. As has been written by other reviewers, Fred Willard steals the show. And many other actors have their moment to shine, too. It just doesnt sustain that high level throughout the entire movie. I would encourage anyone to rent this movie before buying, to see if it meets their expectations. Its good, but its no Guffman."
1,Not funny,"I think this movie was in extremely poor taste on all counts. I know it was supposed to be ""satiracal"" but I found it offensive."
4,"great movie, disappointing DVD","I don't want to say anything about the movie, because we all know it's hilarious yet not as hilarious as waiting for guffman. I simply want to tell you the DVD was disappointing. The deleted scenes are good, but the audio commentary on the movie and the deleted scenes was pretty thin, and often uninteresting. Still worth the price for the movie, but don't expect much else."
3,Depends on if you like dogs or not,"I suggest reaction to this film will vary according to who likes pets and who doesn't. If you're like me and you'd like to care for your pet until it turns 30 against the advice of your vetrinarian, you might feel you're being laughed at, but then, if you're like the neighbor on the corner who might chase you with a rifle if he catches a dog pooing in his yard, well, this IS the film for you! The satire does contain some very cute and original characters. This topic would tempt most film makers to mimic real people. The originality of its comedy did surprise me."
1,BEST IN SHOW,THIS MOVIE WENT TO EXHAUSTIVE LENGHTS TO EXTRACT HUMOR FROM THE OUTRAGEOUS ANTICS OF PEOPLE WHO IN MY OPINION OVERINDULGE THEIR DOGS AND THEMSELVES IN DOG SHOW ETIQUETTE.THE MOVIE WAS DESIGNED TO BE FUNNY BUT I FOUND MYSELF WEARY FROM THE DIALOGUE AND I KEPT WAITING FOR THE PLOT TO TAKE OFF...AND IT NEVER DID.
3,"Funny, but very over-rated.","I got some great laughs out of this movie. Christopher Guest is great of course and Fred Willard is funny (for a while). Parker Posey is bizarre-and not really in a funny way. The rest have their moments as well. Overall I was somewhat disappointed by this film. I realize that Guest's approach to comedy is often more obtuse than direct (SPINAL TAP), but here I just felt like I was going along for the ride. I never really engaged much in the film itself. Funny moments seperated by hum-drum sequences do not a great film make. Average."
1,Don't waste your money!!,This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Please don't waste your money! Gave it one star only because I had to give it something in order to proceed. Need negative stars on there!
3,It's ok,This was not quite what I expected. It was amusing at times but so much sexual humor I was glad I didn't have kids watching. It has a weak plot and no real surprises.
5,Why didn't this movie get noticed?!,"This is one of the funniest damn movies that I have seen in a while. For the lovers of witty, offbeat comedies like Austin Powers and Friday. Every character is hilariously eccentric and every scene had me laughing out loud. Great one-liners. The type of movie that you'll keep talking and laughing about with you're friends for hours and days after you've seen it. Everybody that I have recommended it to (including usually tough reviewers) has loved it. Definitely worth adding to your library as I guarantee you will want to watch it over and over."
5,A comedy classic,"An incredible send up of dog show culture. One of the best from Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy - and that's saying alot. This will appeal to dog owners, dog show folks and fans of SCTV and wry humor in general. The entire cast delivers at the highest level, the writing is impeccable and shines throughout. Fred Willard's performance in his supporting role is as good as it gets in a comedy. You'll love it from beginning to end."
4,Excellent expose of the dog show industry,"This is a skillfully made documentary that manages to overcome some inherent production obstacles. It is clear that the producers were not able to secure the rights to the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show but by fictionalizing some of the main characters they manage to accurately portray the dog show business. I am not a dog owner, nor do I like dogs, but I found this to be an interesting movie nonetheless. The DVD adds a Director's commentary that helps the viewer identify the actors from the genuine dog show participants. For example, all but two of the judges in the movie are real judges, and the film was made in Vancouver, not Philadelphia (which probably explains why they did not include a tour of the famous Cream Cheese factory). Highly recommended adult entertainment. Probably should have been rated ""R"" - so be prepared to talk over some of the more embarassing sexual references if viewing with children, particularly in the opening scene."
1,How can anyone ever like this?,"if I could give it zero I would to quote The Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons ""Worst Movie Ever"" I rented it on DVD and it had a scratch on it and when about 20 minutes in it stopped playing me and my whole family cheered"
4,Mila,"In regard to the description of the movie provided by Amazon. Any heterosexual male who would not be attracted by Mila Jovovich needs his head examined, yet she is not even mentioned in the movie description, although I note that she got top billing on the DVD package."
2,"Had potential, lots of it, but in long run fell short","3 great actors, and what seemed to be an interesting story could've been very compelling, intense, nail biting and such, but was not. This movie just seemed to lost its grittyness or anything within first 20 minutes of the movie. The actualy hook-up seemed too easy and IMO the movie had no climax, no wrap-up, no ending. Steer away from this one. I hope I've been somewhat helpful..-Cam"
3,*********SIGH****************,"With a boring storyline that is woefully predictable, the iconic Robert DeNiro plays a corrections official...Jack Mabry....who makes recommendations to the parole board regarding whether or not an inmate should be released. Edward Norton costars as Gerald ""Stone"" Greeson, the inmate whose life is in the hands of Mabry; he needs to convince Mabry that he is reformed, and is ready for life on the outside. When it appears to Stone as though he may not be convincing the seasoned Mabry that he has indeed turned his life around, he enlists the help of his wife Lucetta (played by Millie Jovovich). Lucetta uses her feminine wiles to help Jack Mabry to see the light....I just had the feeling that I'd seen it all before....or maybe it was just the predictability of the storyline. Whatever the case, 3 stars only....and that's primarily because of the awesome actors and acting throughout.DYB"
2,Disappointing,"Watched the movie all the way through. Although every movie I have seen with Robert de Niro has always been good, this one is disappointing. The acting is good, but its story line is disjointed, not worth recommending."
5,Another Masterpiece from John Curran,"As if The Painted Veil wasn't already a cinematic achievement, English-born Director John Curran comes up with a film that hardly had any publicity, and yet,showcases one of Robert De Niro's finest performances. Edward Norton HASN'Thad a bad film yet and this is no exception. Forget the almost complete silenceaccorded this film by critics and film distributors. This film is a masterpieceof acting, plot, cinematography, editing, sound-nearly perfect in every sense.It also a profoundly sad film that will leave you awake at night wondering aboutjustice, family, intimacy, lust, religion, profligacy and everything else thatexists in our material and non-material world. In a sense, I am half-glad thefilm industry ignored this film-the misunderstood hype and over-used public metaphors would have nearly ruined a magnificent film."
1,Failure out of package - do not purchase,"I waited >30 days to try out the device and it does not work. returning back to original store is no longer an option, so will have to go thru memorex. Do not buy this item."
3,Cheap storage but it's HDD based.,"I bought this on-sale at Fry's Electronics. It heats up since it has a small HDD inside. Looks like Memorex missed the technology boat with this one. Their second generation USBs are now flash. Flash drive prices will fall soon, so if you wait, you can probably get a Flash 4GB drive for about the same price. Flash is much quicker and cooler. As far as durability, I don't use this Memorex drive often, but I see other reviewers saying that theirs died. Anyhow, I burn important data and projects onto optical discs (CD-R and DVDR) which is much more reliable and cheaper than USB drives, and I use a Compact Disc Eraser on them when no longer needed/outdated."
1,Worse than worthless.,"I bought two. Approximately three months later they both died, within a week of each other. Can't trust your data with this. Kudos to the engineers."
4,Great Product - Highly Recommended,"What did I do without this?This is a great investment and absolutely necessary for anyone who has to have batteries ready at any time.The only negative is that the one that was sent to me came as a European version and I had to use the adapter to go in to my home electrical outlet(120V). The adapter is pretty terrible and does not securely fit on the euro version, but just add a little electrical tape and you're good to go.Just buy it, or if you have a lot of batteries buy 2. You won't be disappointed."
2,Cheap brackets seem to small,bracket on one side would not tighten the bracket is to small I had to wrap duct tape around the inner bracket it's still sloppy.
3,Shielding not adequate,"I was hoping these shielded speakers would cut out cell phone interference, but if my phone is closer than about 18 inches, i.e., on the desk, I get the annoying noises from the satellite speakers. On the plus side, a separate bass level control on the right satellite (along with master volume and headphone jack) is very convenient and critical in my opinion to acheiving the right balance at the right volume. I lowered the highest trebel levels on my iTunes equalizer, and I think the resulting sound is fine for a PC system. However, I'm returning mine and getting a system with better shielding."
1,"Not well researched, poor scholarship on a good day","When I heard this guy on the radio (KFI AM640) I wondered if he was sane. I bought and read the book and found it to be full of holes. He brings nothing of substance to the table. He misquotes, quotes out of context, shows no understanding of Greek (uses Latin as his referance), uses poor referances, almost all secondary sources, did not read the JAMA article from 1988, does not understand Church history, and just about everything else.When the light of day is shined on this work it is worthless, shallow, vain and seen as a knee jerk reaction.There are far better books on the subject. If you really want to try to prove Christianity is not true. This one is just flat out LAME!Just as a warning if you really try to prove that Christianity is a falsehood you might just be in for more then you would bargin for.Have a GREAT day!"
3,It's was ok...,"The book was pretty good over all, and it got interesting towards the end. I wouldn't read it over again, but i would recommend it to someone who is new to the gay and lesbian genre."
3,Very High Level OverView,This book is a very high level overview of software estimation. If you really are in need for some hands on books for estimation then look elsewhere.
4,Great Book,"The key ideas are collect historical data and count/measure what you can. This is really a book about good managerial practises that uses the ""Black Art"" of estimation to draw people in.Destined to be a classic. I only rate it as 4 stars because I feel all information is easiest to remember if it is presented in story form, and while there are stories in this book, more stories and a few less charts would suit me better.One other thing is that there is not a lot of practical help for collecting the historical data that will make your future estimates more accurate. Maybe there is a need for another book on this topic."
1,Not really a warrantied product,"Hello, The Camera is great, but if you buy it from Amazon and it breaks, Pentax doesn't accept invoice from Amazon as proof of a warrantieable product. So basically amazon is trying to sell you an unwarrantied product.If you want it, go buy it somewhere else."
1,shower head flow control,"this item leaks from the first time you install it, I tried 3 of them they all leak water, this item have defect in the desigeni do not recomend for any one to buy it"
3,Tiny and can't pour batter from the spout,"I bought this ""pitcher"" because I thought it would be perfect for pouring pancake batter or filling muffin tins. When it arrived I was surprised to see that it only holds about 3 cups and the spout is so narrow that batter can't run through it without glopping over the sides. Plus, I fix LOTS of batter when I make pancakes and this wouldn't hold even half of it. The picture made it look larger, especially when it was shown next to a griddle. And the description didn't say how many cups it held. I did see the dimensions listed after I'd bought it, so it was partly my fault.This is an item I probably won't use much. I use a huge funnel for pouring dry goods like rice in to containers, and I have a watering can with a small spout for watering my plants. At least it was cheap, and had free SuperSaver shipping (my order was over $25).It's not bad, just small, plastic and has a narrow spout that isn't useful in my kitchen."
2,~eh~,"This book, although the values behind the lessons ring loud and clear, didn't particularly teach me anything I didn't already know. The style in which it was written - centered words as if each page was a poem on child rearing, was an interesting choice, but ultimately a waste of space that could have been better used. It is also very religiously biased. I read it in one 30-minute sitting and put it away. I don't think I'll be revisiting it for practical advice, like I do with the Dr. Sears books."
4,The best one I could find,"This book gave me some practical guidance for planning out how to live my life in a single, not-so-big room. After reading this, I lost all my fears of living in a studio and felt prepared to live in one."
4,curtains,"I agree with other reviewers in that you can see the ""reversible"" side through to the other, however, it does not bother me really. It is cute and different from the many other standard curtains bc it has the nice scalloped bottom. One thing to consider for the anal type, the blue curtains hung close to the JOhn Lennon matching wallpaper border, are two totally different blues. the wallpaper is more purple and it looks unmatching up close but again, who cares, the baby won't."
4,Awesome Bargain,"These are a really great for the price. Comfy, great sound, and an unbeatable price. You can't go wrong here."
3,"good sound, solid construction, not very comfortable","I just got these in the mail today. They are solid built headphones, the wire is sturdy, and the head band is very tough. The head band is so solidly constructed that it really forces its tightness on your ears. so it will take a while for them to loosen up a little.Sound quality is very good, with a decent base to go along.I wished they could've used a softer material for the ear cups instead of leather. It gives you sweaty ears."
4,.Good headphones,"The sound quality was great. My only regret was the volume was not able to go to the level I desired. They did an effective job of keeping ambient sound out. Maybe I just have a FAT HEAD, but the headphones fit just a bit too tight and became uncomfortable after about 15 minutes of wearing them"
3,Cheap Headphones Good Sound,"Howdy!These sound fine but the holes are too small for an adult's ears. They gave me a headache before I modified them and stretched the headband a bit. I took the padded cups from my old headset and rubber cemented them to the pads on these. Now my ears fit and aren't crushed and I have double the padding. Next, when I'm not using them, I have them stretched around the long end of a plastic coffee can. They're already a bit looser.It seems like the guy who said that the switch for mono and stereo was mounted backwards was right but it doesn't make any difference to me. I can figure it out. At least the switch works.Good solid headphones that will last and last if you don't have gorrilla hands and aren't rough with them. I leave them plugged into the computer and listen to music when I work.God bless,Douglas"
2,Dumb,I bought this and it just stopped working after about 3 weeks of use. I would not recommend this to anyone......unless you have an extremely low amount of money.
4,Great Computer Few Problems,This is a great computer. Very Fast can play a few games that ask for a 3d card. The Dvd burner is a great plus so is the included software such as works and Age of Empires 2. Sony offers many great media software titles. This is my 2nd sony Viao my other one is 5 years old and still works. I haven't ever had a problem with anything sony. I have a cd player thats over 12 years old and it is still working. Ok the bad about this computer. 1. It's heavy 2. Bad Bad Bad Batery life only last maybe an hour and another battery costs 245.00 so this isn't for travelers. Also sony sections their hard drive in two sections that dosent add up to 40 gb more like 37. Besides these problems this is a great computer just get reddy to lug the brick sized power converter with you.
4,A Workhorse!,"It was with some scepticism that I bought Sony FRV27, more swayed in its favour by the solid brand name. But I have had no difficulty in setting it thru its paces. It is fast, the display is excellent, and a well laid out keyboard and its ports. A tad bit heavy and with an extremely poor battery life. The charger is a bit too heavy particularly when you have to lug it around. The bundled software for making DVDs' is intuitive and easy to work with. You dont miss Nero too much. It could have done with an Infrared port and a S-video out for TV output. But all in all a wonderful package and a joy to work with."
1,This book should not have been published,"This is an awful book. It is poorly plotted and sloppily written. Furthermore, the transition from print to the Kindle edition has not been adequately supervised and so there are countless errors. It is hard to believe that an author with the reputation of Sara Paretsky allowed this title to be published in her name."
1,The author should stay with Vi Warshinsky.,"The story line was disjointed and disappointing. This is a book I would have been unhappy with if I had purchased it instead of getting it from the library. There was supposed to be a message, but I'm not sure what it was, did the characters?"
4,best cap available in the US,"based on swimming 14 km weekly, this is a fine cap that lasts for a reasonable time (2 months). if you have lots of hair, this 1-size-fits-all may be slightly small (better too small than too big in a swim cap). as another review said, wet your hair first if necessary. i agree that durability is not great, but it is not too bad, and it is very comfortable, light, and cool. this is not a cold water cap. my first choice in caps is the nikko mesh, but it is not availbale in the US. i am tempted to give this 5 stars to help offset the review that said the cap cannot keep hair dry (this is a cap for swimmers)."
1,Too small,"I have always used Speedo swim caps and this is the first that I am unable to wear the cap because it is too small. For a moment I though it was a youth size but after checking the package I confirmed it is adult size. The material seems ok but I will never be able to test its durability because I cannot put the cap on, and I am normal size. So in general I recommend Speedo Lycra Caps, if you can try it on first, but otherwise, be aware that you might get a cap that won't fit you, even if it is sold by Amazon (my case). It barely fits my 10 year old. I am going to try and return it but I'll have to pay the return shipping."
5,Favorite Cap for my 8 y-o and 4 y-o,My kids have long hair and this is the only cap they can put on with ease and without pulling hair. Quality is great and cap lasts through several weekly swims. It also helps keep goggles in the proper place. I'd buy again and recommend to everyone. Happy swimming!
4,great cap - not the color pictured,as far as the fit/comfort/price - Love this cap & so do my girls!no hair pulling - & keeps hair out of their faceBUT - the cap in the picture is light pink & the one we recieved was hot pink.not what we wanted - so pretty disappointed
1,Overpriced garbage,"If these things were well made the price would be high. But they're cheaply made garbage so that the price is outrageous. When they work, they do save a fair bit of space but you can pretty much count on them leaking. Save your money."
1,"Can you say ""0"" stars please???",Oh what a disappointment! I really needed these to work. I agree 100% with reviewer S.Tomlin. Everything said was 100% accurate...DO NOT buy these!!!!
1,Totally Worthless,Wish I had read these reviews before I bought these bags. I can't believe they are still on the market. Eveyone we used lost the vacuum within a month. THEY ARE JUNK.
1,Worst Product ever,"NEVER HOLD SUCTION, cheap plastic tears in no time. A hefty lawn bag is made of thicker plastic. These guys should be put out of business for such a shoddy product. Doesn't deserve the one star."
1,Not even close,"This product is not even close to what it is advertised as. Great idea, but the ""air-tight and water-tight"" claim is a big fat bust. Looks fantastic when you first vacuum it all up, but wait just a few hours to see the air seep back in. It's so frustrating that it makes you want to scream. I haven't seen one bag hold the vacuum seal yet. My advice - - - use the $30 on a manicure and pedicure instead."
1,Space Bags,"I would rate it a -5 if it would let me.I will never buy this junk again. They split open everywhere...including at the 'zipper'. They are thin and just junk. The seller said to call the company, who hasn't gotten back to me in over a month. I will call the seller again if I can find them...they SEEMED to be helpful, tho' the jury's still out.JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!!"
1,Good only for taking out garbage,"Several years ago, we bought the old ones. They all leaked and were worthless. Saw this time that they're guaranteed, so bought a 12-pack. I did not overfill any of them (the earlier bags didn't have a fill level--these tell you where to stop). The first extra large bag--closed the zipper and the zipper ripped a hole in the bag. The second extra large seems to be okay, but doesn't compress as much as I think it should, and you have to really press hard to get the air from the bottom of the bag to the vacuum disk. Large bag--leaked and filled with air, slowly but immediately. I even underfilled it. Never did find the leak. Bottom line: these are no better than they were before. I'm sending in to get my money back and will NEVER buy Space Bags again."
2,Anything larger than a medium doesn't work,I purchased several of these bags and the only ones that hold a seal are small & medium. I have about 4 that are large and jumbo and have sucked the air out of them so many times - they just keep leaking. I'm not impressed and will only give it two stars for the smaller bags.
1,What a rip off!!!!,"I have not received my 16-pc of Space Bag order and it was ordered early September. From reading the other reviews, it sounds like I'd be just as well off without ever getting it. At the least, I want my money back. This is such a good idea for a product - too bad. I hope you go to prison for many years. I'd bet you've been there before for ripping off the public. It's too bad such a decent company as Yahoo got messed up with you."
3,Not as bright as I hoped...,"The Game Boy Micro 20th Anniversary Edition, perhaps the rarest amongst the Game Boy line of portable systems, is decent at best. When comparing it to the DS Lite (I know, kind of an unfair comparison), the screen's brightness is inferior, and the screen's even smaller (than the DS Lite). Making GBA games harder to play. I mainly bought this as a collector's item, more so than to play games with. I'll stick with my DS lite when I want to play GBA games.On the bright side, the graphics look crisper on the Micro than the DS because it packs much smaller pixels; but the incredibly dim screen compensates it from being a fun platform to play GBA games on. And it's incredibly lightweight, which is great for small kids (if only they could see what's going on in the game)I'd recommend the GBA Micro only for hardcore/veteran-Nintendo/Portable Game collectors/fans. The casual crowd should either stick with the GBA SP or DS (Lite) for GBA gameplay."
2,Micro is a waste of money,"Both the GBA and GBA SP are backward compliant with GB and GBC games. Not true with the Micro. So don't waste your money on this thing, get an SP. They both have a lit screen and rechargeable battery, but the SP has the added benefit of playing ANY gameboy title."
1,Fugazi sound like a f**ked up Offspring,"Fugazi is so bad it hurts, I've never liked them because they can't sing and their music is just plain boring. These guys are so old its funny, whoever takes this band seriously is an idiot."
5,moot court,"The argument is moot regarding the quality of this record. Greatness Is end of discussion. So pull out the plastic and buy this one, now!! If there were any justice in this hopeless, pathetic world this record would go mega-platinum (x 1000), but there isn't so do your measely part and buy it. Unless you have ears of tin you will enjoy."
1,Don't waste your money,I should have realized that this was going to be a waste. Too much money for only a few pages of prose.
2,disappointing,"More than half of this book is about something else than religion and its monsters. I was not interested in horror movies or horror novels when I bought this book. Also, sometimes the book feels like a compilations of articles on different subjects. Yes, it is well written. It simply should have a different title."
5,A famous edition,A famous edition of an old standard for stats and I gave this to someone as a gift but knew of it and was told by him that it is still one of the best books on the subject matter.
5,Pretty much the same as the 4th,I needed the 4th edition for my Stat class and so far the 3rd edition has been a page-for-page duplicate of the 4th. Plus mine had highlighter marking on the important theories and formulas (:
5,Dog lover is disc happy!,"For anyone just getting started in disc-dog sports, this video is it! The training video answered all my questions and covered every topic in the sport from A-Z. I could barely throw a disc, but with the demonstration and step by step guidance, I am throwing like a pro now! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to play and throw with your family pet."
3,Ideal for handguns only.,"These are great for handguns, but are virtually useless for rifles/shotguns because you can't get the ratchet post behind the trigger and with some effort, can be shifted enough to expose the trigger."
4,"Only got two keys, not four as pictured.","Good price, good fit on all guns. Solid feel on locks.However, the picture shows four keys and I only received two."
3,A lot better than no lock,"The Master Gun Lock does secures most firearms very well but is a little hard to install on some.Since every firearm should be mechanically secured this is am easy way to do this. Keys are always a problem and are small. Knowing kids, they will find keys and firearms so a combination safe is in my opinion the best primary security.Keeping the individual firearm locked is a secondary safety feature and reminds the person handling the firearm of safety. A trigger lock is not recommended for use on any loaded firearm and may not prevent it from cycling or firing."
1,Doesn't Fit Anything,"I tried these on all six of my guns of various sizes and shapes (two pistols, two shotguns, and two rifles) and they didn't fit a single one. There wasn't enough room behind the any of the triggers to install the lock as instructed."
2,So so product,I used this product for about a week and I could see no difference at all. There are lots of products out there so I guess my search continues
2,something has changed,"after finding St. Tropez (using many self tanners that did not do the job) I fell in love with this product. it makes your skin actually look tan and does not have that familiar stinky odor that comes along with so many self tanners, but the formula has changed somehow. this has affected the color in a negative way, it used to have almost the slightest green tinge to it, giving it a brown tan hue. it now has a more orangy look to it. so disappointing. I even called the company, they too said it has aloe in it give the green tint to it, to make it brown, they seemed suprised by the color not being right, but this is the 4th product purchased. they have changed something, and not for the better. so disappointing!!!"
2,Not as good as expected,"I applied this twice and it went on spotty and I found I had to re apply every other day. Wasn't a fan of the smell, but that's normal for sunless tanners. I stopped using it and went back to Jergens Glow, at least that goes on even. The best sunless tanner I have used, although expensive, is Sun Goddess."
2,Stinks!!!,Ive tried many self tanning products and I have read all the reviews so i bought the St. tropez. It smells so bad that I couldnt even go to sleep...It made me so nautious...and to top it off it was so orange and streaky. Nothing makes this different from any other self tanner...except the price!!! Very expensive and not really worth it.
5,Love it!!,I use ST. tropez every day on my face and I love it. Even in MN I look like I have some color in my face.
5,Nice and Easy!,This product provides instant tan. Application is easy and done in just minutes. The color looks like a real tan with no streaking. I have had so many compliments on my great tan!
2,"Bunny was a great, but you'd never know it with this","Bunny Berigan was one of the great jazz trumpet soloists of the 1930s, but with some of the dreck he either chose to record or was forced to record (many included on this disc) you'd barely know it. The lead track is a perfect example of this dichotomy. ""The Pied Piper"" is a bouncy little number with some good trumpet breaks, but the song is plain awful. To make matters worse, Bunny's vocalists were not top flight, and they get plenty of time at the mike (14 of 22 songs). A couple of tributes to Bix at the end of the CD appear promising, but in reality drag monotonously. Too many goofy lyrics and syrupy vocals. Definitely not enough Bunny."
5,The smarm is the charm,"Harlan Ellison has long been known for his great science-fiction writing. On this reading of ""A Boy and His Dog,"" Harlan's smarmy voice gives a great reading as the confident Vic and Blood. I usually don't like straight reading in audio-books. I like audio-dramas a lot more. However, with Ellison, you get a great reading of a classic story and also ""Repent Harlequin, Said the Tick-Tock Man."" Too bad it's out of print. I had a copy and lost it. Now I'll have to wait to get it through some used bookstore. Don't make the same mistake if you already have this gem of an audio-book. By the way, if you have a copy and would like to get rid of it, let me know!Jack Sprat"
5,I'm addicted,I am hopelessly addicted to these jalapeño pieces. Someone help me. I need some kind of medication to wean me off of them.
5,The best!,"As a rule, Snyder's just makes the best pretzels, hands down. They've been making them for 100 years now and well, there's a reason they're still in business! These are great - they disappear rather quickly. My only complaint is that they're small and very hard so they scrape the roof of your mouth. Other than that, they're the best tasting things out there. Highly recommend!"
5,It's like eating real hot wings!!!,"If you like pretzels and you like hot wings. Do yourself a favor and try these. You will not believe how much like a true hotwing they made these pretzels taste.Oh and to the 3 star reviewer who didn't like that they are hot. Umm they don't call them cool wings. They are not hot, but do have a spice to them. If you are someone that eats hotwings you will love them."
2,A nice encyclopedia of bitchy comments,"I read the free preview. If I ever see a cheap copy, I will buy it because Tricks of the Trade is an encyclopedic collection of ass-biting remarks that the stereotypical bitchy queen supposedly spews, non-stop. Unfortunately, unlike the bitchy queens I know, per Chapter One, most of Trick's bitchyness is not that funny--but some is.However, every writer should have this resource--well not every writer and --maybe ""should have"" is too strong a phrase.Chapter One promises that the reader will not like any of the characters and some may not even like the author--and they want money for this e-book?antonio chan"
2,Not so tricky,"I've tried twice to get into this bestselling book. It's clever and fun, but I can't seem to make it past page 90. It just gets so vapid so quickly, and it's nowhere as great as some of the books to which it's compared (""Sex Toys of the Gods"", ""California Screaming""). I've even tried skipping ahead, but all the zippy inside jokes get real thin. At least the cover will help sell it."
2,Feet a still sweaty,like all socks sold anymore. Not enough cotton. They don't breath. I would pay top dollar for a high thread count pair of socks.
4,Helping me to have a delightful unspoiled child,"I was given this book by a friend who told me she wished she had found when her then 4 year old was a baby. I gave this book 4 stars because as other reviewers have pointed out, the writing is a bit dry and after a few attempts I stopped even looking at the few graphs, but overall I have found this book enormously helpful.The advice given is very practical and the book has helped me to recognize my daughter's ""new"" (sometimes confusing) behaviors as normal stages in her development and also to form strategies to help her through the potential pit falls and to deal with the inevitable rough spots. I re-read the section dealing with her current age from time to time just to remind myself of what I should be looking for / doing.My daughter is 15 months old now and when we were visiting family this summer I got nothing but compliments on her. Thank you Burton White."
2,Very flawed,"The book is not properly conceived. It pits the 19th century linguistics orthodoxy about the chronology of the Vedic people against a diverse set of scholars. On the one hand, you have the archaeologists who are completely against the racist basis of the linguists' framework; on the other, you have most Sanskritists and historians of astronomy who claim that the internal evidence within the Vedic books goes against the linguists' chronology. Bryant conflates all these diverse scholars with ""Hindu nationalists"", suggesting a political agenda behind the views!He has created a false dichotomy of AIT and OIT. In fact, most of the scholars who reject AIT reject its chronology of invasions or immigration around 2000 BC, preferring to stay silent on the situation before 4000 BC or so.The intellectural framework for the book is weak. Its one redeeming feature is that it brings together many different views. Bryant is to be commended for not taking sides too brazenly."
3,Nice book,I bought this book for my son for his new ball python. It's got good information but it's more directed on how to handle imported balls. No info on the anatomy of the snake but lots of info on disease/parasite control.
3,its ok,"a little to firm for me.do not think i would buy it again. every thing else was ok, but just was not what i needed."
2,This pillow lives in my closet now,"I would have given a 1 star rating but I did get some medical benefit from it. I started having pressure in my eyes and lymph nodes in my head which prevented me from laying flat. The first week I tried sleeping directly on the pillow and it was torture. It is brick hard with little give. It helped relieve some of the pressure, but I was so uncomfortable I would wake up through the night and be sore the next day. I tried it for a straight week in hopes that I would get used to it or maybe it would soften but no luck. Eventually I had to put a thick pillow on top of it to make it through the night. The reason I purchased the wedge was to get away from having to stack pillows to begin with. I used it off and on for 3 months and finally tossed it in the closet. Even with light use, the thin cheap pillow case has a tear in it. I currently have a firm bed so when I read the previous reviews about the wedge being hard I thought I could handle it but I was wrong."
3,It's okay,Great for the relief at first but the foam is not holding up very well........still thankful for the product in a crisis situation!
4,An underrated work,"While this album got a bit of a critical pounding when it came out, it has a lot of good songs on it. ""Moon & Tree,"" the opening track, is one of my favourite songs, harking back to the summery feel of ""Five Days"" without being a retread of anything on that album. It's one of Greg Keelor's ""living in the country"" tunes and it sounds like one of his happier songs in a while. Keelor's work on this record ranges from that type to breakup rockers to meandering opuses like ""Frogs' Lullaby"" -- a strange piece that grows on you.Jim Cuddy's material also includes several good tunes, notably the midtempo ""Shed My Skin,"" the jazzy ballad ""Falling Down Blue,"" and the poppy protest song, ""It Could Happen To You."" (This is no longer a band that feels they have to write political songs, but when the spirit moves them they still know how.)Not a classic, perhaps, but at least eleven of the fourteen songs could be rated from good to excellent. That's not bad."
4,Perfect Desktop Speakers,"these speakers are perfect for your home or office. While they aren't really loud, they are just powerful enough for a workplace setting. And you can't beat the price ;)"
1,not good speakers,"I have have already exchanged these speakers once, and i am going to return them again. They sound good when you first turn them on, but as time goes on, they start to crackle, pop, and make windy sounds. This continued even when they were disconnected from the computer. I do not reccomend these."
4,Great sound for the price! Great looking as well.,I really liked these speakers. They replaced the OEM speakers and really have a great sound for the price. They probably don't have the output of higher end speakers but the quality was great. No crackle and very little hiss. Bass response was impressive.
4,Good for the price,"If you are looking for an upgrade for tinny laptop speakers or ultra cheap non-powered or even powered 2.0 speaker systems, this will fit the bill perfectly. They are compact and the control pod is very convenient. The sound quality is adequate for basic computer use if you tweak the EQ settings of your sound card or playback application. If you are looking for audiophile level fidelity or desk shaking bass you will be disappointed. It is too underpowered for any substantial bass response. If you turn the volume up too high the subwoofer does that sharp ""boom"" in the 40 to 60 hz range that causes the driver to cut out. Overall, good quality sound for this price point. It will not compete with anything from the likes of Bose, but in the sub $30 crowd - a very good value."
3,Just O.K.,Sound with old DVD cannot be adjusted higher to make then enjoyable to watch. Music CD excellent sound. Newer DVD ok sound.
2,"Good sound, BAD quality","These speakers have a decent sound, but aren't even loud enough to fill a small room. After a couple months of using them off and on, the 3.5mm stereo plug died and can only get a connection if it's turned at a certain angle. Overall, it is a mediocre speaker system."
4,Great speakers for the price!,"Great sound for such Little speakers, Bass is really good i usually don't have it passed the half way mark. Good cable length for the speakers as well. I have no problems with them so far. Awesome speakers for $30 plus they look good also, i would recommend these."
4,Just Enough,Well lets start of buy saying that these are a great price and you defiantly get what you pay for. The bass if great for 30$ and highly recommend these if you have a laptop or a small setup. But you should probably invest in better speakers if you have some fancy domain.
1,"good price, killer hum",Not sure how this got 3.5 stars from the other raters.I bought a set a few days ago for $30 and I think I'll have to throw it out.The 60 Hz hum makes it sound like there's a motor big enough to lift an elevator in the room. It's hard to hear the music over the noise.I sent customer support a note but no reply.
4,Printer Dock by Kodak,"I purchased this unit to save gas and print my own pictures. Easy to operate and the pictures are good quality, and water proof."
3,1st cartridge only printed 15 photos,"I do not like the fact that you must buy the paper and cartridge from Kodak. Where is the competition? On top of that you pay $.50 per picture just to print a photo. And to beat all, I only got 15 photos from a 40 print cartridge. I am starting to think I should have left photo printing up to the professionals."
3,Kodak ink and paper,"The pictures were great, but the ink ran out long before it should. Had lots of paper left and did not get the 100+ pictures per box that I should have. It is still better than my 3-in-1 printer that I have."
1,This price listed is ridiculous!,"In the product description for the 160 pack of paper and ink it says you can print photos for about 29 cents each. I don't know what kind of funny math Amazon is using, but for $169 that comes out to over a dollar per picture. That's ridiculously expensive. I love my EasyShare printer and love to be able to print great quality photos at home if I only need to print a few. If I need a lot I still order them from Kodak or Shutterfly because it is cheaper. No way am I paying that much, though. What the hell, Amazon."
2,should have been better,"As a beginner, this is what i expect in a book: different types of detailed examples covering the numerous commands the are frequently encountered in Part, Assembly, and Drawing modes - simple enough, right?. I've had difficulty just patterning a feature around a circular part, and this book didn't help much. Well, I cant be all that negative because I am a novice at this but, so far so average...or maybe my bias comes out of the fact that pro-e isn't as user friendly which is no fault of the author...Also, the CD it comes with is not of much help and I cant run it on Win 98 (don't know why)"
2,Disappointing,"I had found a review for one of the Ms. Fairstein's more recent books, read captions on them all and purchased the first two.... wish I would have read the first one before I bought the second (I'm hoping the second to be better.)I'm not even halfway through the book, still at Martha's Vineyard, and am forcing myself to finish. I know I could put it down for another, well-seasoned author but I always feel like I've wasted my time by not finishing.IDK, the book is like a boring narrative; the writing amateurish and just to full of extraneous details. Even if the second book has better ratings, I don't know if I will read it any time soon because I just can't connect - no, I just don't like ""Coop."" No particular reason, just don't like her."
4,"A perfect read for those who find themselves ""Post-Cornwall""","I finished up Patricia Cornwall's series and then moved on to Linda Fairstein. It was a perfect transition! The witty dialog between Cooper and Chapman is top-notch, and anyone who is a fan of the well-known TV show can immediately dive right on in. It is my only hope that Linda Fairstein will continue to write more!"
4,Excellent debut novel,"The title, ""Final Jeopardy"" refers to the quiz show which plays only a minor role in the novel. Although the identity of the murderer was somewhat precictable (my first guess at the beginning of the book was incorrect; my second guess in the middle was correct), the characters were real enough to be believable and the contrast in setting between New York City and Martha's Vineyard was well done. I enjoyed the character of Alexandra Cooper and felt that Ms. Fairstein gave her just the right touch of grit and femininity. I hope that Ms.Fairstein will write more Alexandra Cooper novels where she will further develop her character and give us more information about Alex's past"
2,She got better after this one,"Had this been the first Linda Fairstein book I'd read, I would never have read another. Only stubborn refusal to give in allowed me to finish ""Final Jeopardy."" I found myself getting frustrated that such interesting premises and plot twists could be written in such a lifeless way.Also, having met the characters in another novel, I was surprised at how unlikeable they were in this one. The heroine behaves unprofessionally in her work life, and she is somehow both emotional and cold in her private life. It was difficult to sympathize with her. She didn't come across that way in the other book.There were good things. The short side stories of other sex crimes were interesting, if a little distracting. The author also does a good job of explaining why someone would want to pursue this particular disturbing career. You want to like her.Devoted Fairstein fans may like this book, but reading this one before the others may make it impossible to pick up the next one."
4,Great beach book!,"The first I've read of this author. I absolutely fell in love with the main character, A.D.A. Alexandra Cooper, and I certainly hope Ms. Fairstein plans on bringing her back in the future. I also loved the settings (NYC and Martha's Vineyard) in which the book took place. This wasn't the most involved murder/suspense book I've ever read, but I certainly did not want to put this book down! Characters are not who they seem, and Ms. Fairstein certainly kept me guessing as to the final outcome. Definitely a ""must read"" for all of you Mary Higgens Clark fans out there - if you love MHC, you'll love this book"
3,Final jeopardy,I have not read this book yet but it sounded like a good mystisry story.My mother got sick and passed away from cancer in 2010 and i have gotten behind on my reading.
5,Excellent compilation,"This CD is definitely one to buy. It has bouncy to mellow sounds, all which are amazing to listen to. The scene in Chicago is kickin' it hard, and you can tell from the CD. Absolutely the best CD I've bought lately."
2,WHERE ARE ALL THE SONGS????,"I have been searching high and low, and I am glad to see I'm not the only one - I have also been searching like mad for that slow, haunting song playing on the radio in the car while the best friend was making out with the stalker chick....... and it definitely ISN'T on the album. What the f45k is the point of a sountrack to a film if they leave out so much from the score??Thanks to the guys that listed the missing tracks -- I just hope I can find a source to download the tracks seperately, without having to buy an entire album for just ONE song I have been looking for."
1,Not even worth what you pay for,"I got these speakers in late december, and by march 1st they were almost entirely useless. Even before they broke, the headphone jack for whatever reason had an insane amount of noise or scrambling. But for no reason at all, about 3 weeks ago one speaker started making lots of buzzing sounds and by the next day stopped working entirely. They had not been in any way damaged or mistreated and died on their own. Needless to say even for 20$ i would expect at least 6 months of use out of them. Dont bother spending you money."
1,Didn't know you can sell trash over amazon.,"It was horrible, soon as i plug the speakers in it was making a constant noise, really annoying, the speakers were junk, worst purchase i've ever made from amazon. I would've returned them but I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back. So i just smashed them and went to best buy and got new ones. I know it was a cheap speaker, but hell it should atleast work properly. Talk about trash."
1,Redeemed,Ritz Camera offered to redeem my money for this purchase when I complained about the speakers not being what I was looking for. Apparently they have a good customer service department.
4,Good product,You can't reach to high with these. but it is nice it doesn't required a power line (uses USB).
1,very poor speakers,"Like several other reviewers, I bought these, thinking that 'they couldn't be *that* bad'. But I was wrong. They *are* that bad. Yes, they buzz annoyingly. Yes, nearby cell phones cause popping/buzzing in the speakers. And beyond that, within a few days the right speaker blew out (even at a very tame volume level)."
2,Driven To Write This Book Is More Like It,"I could have written this book. It contains nothing more than what was already in Texas Monthly, the local news, and Dateline. Mr. Linedecker threw this together in a hurry and it's not worth your time or money."
1,Cheaply made...not good for sewing,"I purchased these to use for clipping threads while sewing. I used them twice before putting them aside. They feel cheap, they don't cut well at all.Put your money towards a better pair of clippers....I think my toenail clippers would work better than these do."
2,junk,"The blades on this cheap plastic clip won't stay tightly together despite adjusting the screw. The tips do not come to a point, but are instead blunted. So getting it under a thread can be tough. The blades also dulled rather quickly. Save your money for something better."
2,:(,"Not sharp.. Comfy to hold but does not do the job well, first day i use it, i put it away and never touch it again.Its just getting in my way trying to use it to do my projects."
1,returns are a problem,"I do own 2 of this cameras. One was stuck in B/W mode all the time (IR LED's were on, as well) - so there is a problem with the day/night circuit within the camera.I called the service- hot-line and was told that I have to send in the unit on my costs... also that there would be a charge; I would get my money back, if it would be determined that the fault falls under warranty.I decided to let it go - it's not worth it.-Update: the second camera died shortly after end of warranty period."
4,Nice camera for the price,"This is a very nice camera, and the housing is solid and functional in terms of getting the viewing angle you need and keeping the camera out of the elements. The 60' cord included is great, and since it's an RCA connection, if you need more distance ANY RCA audio/video cable will work (eg; I used an old 50' mono/phono RCA cable added to the cable provided and it works fine). I have two of these cameras hooked up to a Slingbox for remote monitoring of our family vacation cabin. The picture in any type of daylight, including twilight, is great. The night vision leaves a little to be desired BUT with any additional light source it works very well. Past 15 feet in total darkness the infrared is only good for seeing objects which reflect light, such as license plates. Another nice thing about the infrared is the suble red light which makes the camera visible in darknes - a good deterent in total darkness."
3,good book for kids,The young audiance found it funny . Nice way to present Bible stories Great for Sunday school class written for kindergarden and primary children
2,Dissappointed - Expected Better,"Ordered these Cyber-Acoustic CA-2022's based on reviews and previous experience with Cyber Acoustics. I have a Cyber Acoustics set (with subwoofer) I purchased at Costco a decade ago that are absolutely amazing. While I didn't expect miracles for $19.99, I was hoping for a great ""bang for the buck"" from Cyber Acoustics in the CA-2022's. IMHO,these speakers deliver muddy sound throughout the entire frequency spectrum. NOTE TO CYBER ACCOUSTICS: I would have gladly paid 3 times as much for a stereo pair (w/o sub) that deliver clean/clear sound. On a positive note I also ordered a Cyber Acoustics CA-492 iPod/iPhone speaker dock that does a great job. The CA-492 delivers the exceptional ""Bang for the Buck"" that I have come to expect from Cyber Acoustics."
4,Good sound for a good price!,"Despite some of the comments for these speakers, I am very very pleased. Good sound for a really good price!!!"
4,A happy customer!,CELEBRATION is a forgotten gem from the crown jewels of the entertainment world. The Tom Jones - Harvey Schmidt score is melodic and delightful. I recommend this to any musical theatre aficionado.
1,"1000 Great Rail-Trails, 3rd: A Comprehensive Directory","Wow seems like a great deal to get all the Rail-To-Trail in the United States but its not! It does provide a list of all the trails but its very limited. It's basically a list of Trials (about 5 trials on each page). It provides almost no information about the trials expect for the mileage and the surface. It fails to give you the exact starting points, it only list the town names as the starting points. It would be nice to know the exact address for the starting points. It does not give you any idea as to the grade or time it will take for the ride or the level of difficulty or even a map of the trial. This book is not worth the money. Stick with the individual state rail-to-trail guides."
1,Solution to lock up problem,I too have been plagued by the HELLO display lock up issue.I called Samsung and they recommened:Unplug the unit from ACRemove the Antenna connection from the back of the unit.Plug back into ACpower onthen plug the antenna back in
1,forget this one,"What starts off with promise soon turns into a very lame movie.A few people including Jolene Blalock and James Marsters wake up in rooms all by themself.They don't remember their names or what they did and soon here very loud ominous noises.Once they discover what it is it just gets bad.W/O giving too much away they soon use flashlights to help them survive.Someone said this is like Cube,well wrong Cube is 10x better and more intelligent than this mess.Save your time and skip this like I should have"
1,Medicore at best...extremely cheesy,"Weak storyline...very cheesy dialogue...just didn't feel like a SAW movie. If anything...it felt like a SAW rip off, except without the monsters chasing people.This had such great potential, although one part really did throw me off, I wasn't expecting it.Overall, bad acting and bad dialogue."
5,Shadow Puppets Is A Must See!!!,"CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS! Shadow Puppets stars James Marsters,Jolene Blalock and Tony Todd. It's an excellent thriller, that will keep you on the edges of your seat!!!YOU CAN'T MISS JAMES MARSTERS' IN HIS UNDERWEAR FOR MOST OF THE MOVIE!!!! Shadow Puppets is the best movie I have seen in a long time. I GIVE IT 5 STARS OUT OF 5. IT IS A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!Shadow Puppets is about a group of strangers who wake up in a locked asylum with no idea of who who they are or how they got there.They are all in their underwear,cold and scared.They are being killed of by a Shadow creature, and need to find a way out of the asylum. As the movie goes on, you will will see that not all is what it seems, that someone has been lying. But I won't say who? You will have to watch the movie to find out!!!"
4,Get it before it's gone!,"This is the one that introduced me to The Chameleons and thus has a special place in my heart. It's sometimes a bit heavier in and rougher around the edges than other Chameleons releases, but in most cases that just adds to the charm. A handful of tracks achieve a truly special level of emotion and atmosphere that I honestly haven't heard before or since. For that alone I would say it's a necessity for any Chameleons fan. Get this one before it disappears."
5,Battery tender,"I have not had very long, put two batterys on it working just fine keeping batterys at going at top condition."
5,good product,"This is my third battery tender, I already have two other single port tenders and needed another two ports for my truck and Harley while I'm deployed. So far the wife says she hasn't had a problem with batteries being dead after a month+ of no use. Its nice knowing you can walk out and start your spare vehicles after not using them for extended periods of time."
5,Great design,"Works great, keeps both batteries charged.Great design for diesel trucks with two batteries would recommend for diesel truck owners who don,t drive much un the winter time."
4,Astro Boy,"Astro Boy is a young robot from futuristic Metro City. Created by a brilliant scientist named Tenma and powered by pure positive ""blue"" energy that gives him such abilities as x-ray vision, inhuman speed, and flight, the wide-eyed android longs to find his true place in the world. He sets out on an epic journey that brings him face to face with an underworld army of robots and some of the strangest creatures ever to walk the Earth, and along the way learns to experience human feelings and emotions. ""Astro Boy"" is well produced and is very entertaining. There was plenty of comedy to keep the movie light and lots of action to keep things moving. There are many endearing characters in this movie and interesting villains also. All in all, well and cleverly done. I recommend this to anyone who wants some light-hearted entertainment."
4,Good value...,"DVD arrived quickly. The disc was in great condition. The case/box had seen much better days. Overall, pleased with my purchase. No skips or abnormalities while watching the movie. Thanks."
3,"Just be aware, there are only 2 songs on this cd!","Since there were no reviews or track listings, I had no idea when I purchased this that this was just a single and only contained 2 songs. Wanted to let others know as well in case you were thinking of ordering it so you wouldnt be disappointed."
1,Like getting hit over the head by the Bible??,"I loved Mr. Chapmans's 5 Love Languages and was really looking forward to this one. The main reviews didn't prepare me for it. I think if I were being counciled by a priest I would have heard LESS biblical references. Really... every page? I've studied the Bible in and out of church, so quotes used for various purposed are vary difficult for me to get through in a layman's text.This book would be good for you IF:You are a practicing Catholic or Christian. Other Bible based religions may apply.You believe God is a third party in your marriage.It would help if the above is also true of your spouse."
3,Not flat shoe like other Adidas,"I'd recommend to try other Adidas shoes in the shop before buying this. Try out Samba classic. If you like that, this will be fine with you. If not, I wouldn't try. Front foot grip is good, but not very comfort as may expected. it seems all adidas shoes have small bump inside which isn't confortable to me. I was looking for totally flat slip-on, but it's not."
5,The book that saved our marriage. I'm not joking.,"Before we bought this book, I knew five recipies. When it was my turn to cook dinner, my wife got to choose between pancakes, tacos, spaghetti, hot dogs, and a lousy stirfry. This was a source of no small amount of tension in our household, as she wanted a little more variety and taste in our diet, and I was uninterested in spending more time on cooking, and unsure of myself when it came to learning new recipies.This cookbook was a compromise for us -- a way to hopefully add more variety while not scaring me off, and not taking forever to cook. It worked brilliantly. We have discovered 25-30 recipies in it that we absolutely love, and that I find easy to cook. The shopping lists and the instructions are easy to follow and make the cooking pretty painless. My one caveat is that I am a slooooow chef, so most of these take me 30-45 minutes to cook, but that may just be me."
5,WOW,"This is easily one of the best movies I've seen recently. When it came out I didn't think it looked all that good especially having Ashton Kutcher play a non-comedic role, but I don't think that any actor could have done the job better. Everything from the acting the flashbacks the story is great, it just goes beyond awesome. The movie grabs you and won't let go, definetly a must see."
2,butterfly trauma!,"great acting,great plot,wonderful special effects. but highly disturbing content and an even more disturbing directors cut ending on the dvd. not for the weak of heart.seeing it once was enough for me. i found it to be a very raw and harsh film."
4,Very deep...and very disturbing,"(Author ofSeconds From Jane)This movie is very smart. I watch or read most everything that comes out about time travel. I love the treatment of the metaphysical aspects of time travel that this movie deals with. Really makes you think. I gave four stars instead of five because I'd love to watch this a few more times, but it's just too disturbing."
5,Should become a classic.,"Excellent. A great theatrical update for 2004 of the underlying premise of ""It's a Wonderful Life""; the unknown purpose of a life or at least the effects of an individual's actions. I highly recommend this DVD. The documentaries on the chaos theory and time travel (especially the references to other movies in that genre) are splendid. The acting is truly amazing and one can believe each character with different personalities in each alternate reality. Read a few of the other reviews for some great plot summaries. Wish there was release with none of the nudity, maybe without the Goth roommate altogether. Would be a great movie to show or recommend to high-schoolers for class discussions on chaos theory and life choices."
2,Good & bad at the same time,"This movie was actually really hard to watch at times & I actually had to turn it off at one point becasue it was getting a little too disturbing. It was only with proding of friends did I turn it back on & watch the rest of the movie. Surprisingly & thankfully the movie got better from then on as the story came together. It turned out to be a pretty decent movie, but I really wouldn't recremend it to anyone just because it does leave you feeling really empty inside and like I said before it was very disturbing/dark. The sad part is that you watch this film, get through all the crap, to where it finally gets interesting and then, the ending (which I won't ruin for you) totally sucks. I cannot & will not recomend this movie eventhough it was very intriguing."
4,Intelligently chaotic,"The implications of chaos theory (the theory that individual events can have countless unpredictable consequences)are intelligently explored in this highly watchable but ultimately depressing sci-fi movie.In recent years hollywood has spent huge amounts of blockbuster dollars examining the potential horrors of genetic predestination, this movie warns that the opposite view - the fantasy that individuals are made through their interactions with others in society, could be just as nightmarish for our notions of self-identity. There is also a rather iffy pro-abortion message that can be read into the plot - the happiness of the community and in particular the central character's mother can only be obtained by that character never having been born - he was after all 'never meant to be'. Nethertheless, a well made film that is sure to get any intelligent film buff thinking."
5,This movie scared the heck out of me,"I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but I loved it. Ashton Kutcher is, and always will be, a pinhead in my mind - Dude, where's my car? Note that I loved that movie. It is SO hard to take him seriously. But I couldn't help it - this movie is excellent. The script is GREAT, and the movie had me jumping out of my skin. I won't reveal anything of the plot to you. I guarantee you that once you see this movie, you will have to watch it once more, to catch what you missed the first time.The special effects were excellent, not over the top. The continuity of the film is excellent. And the DVD setup allows you to watch the movie with the deleted scenes worked in, as a director's cut.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good, original horror/thriller with far more emphasis on plot than on gore. You will not be disappointed."
5,There is 4 Different Endings on this Disc.,"This movie is up there with Sixth Sense, The Village and Signs. Watch the directors cut version and the ending with blow you away. This is one of my all time favorites and have watched it 4 times and each time I noticed something different. This is a must have for your collection watch it with friend."
3,The butterfly effect,Ending is not the same as the ending I saw on VHS-so I was not too thrilled. I like the 'other' ending far better.Great flick tho
1,Really lame and really violent,"First off, I wanted to see this when it was in theaters, but I never got around to it. I bought this movie from Hollywood Video a few weeks ago and I was very disappointed. this movie was 1.highly unbelievable and 2.incredibly violent.It took too long to get to the climax. I saw a different ending from the one in the theaters, but i heard about what happened in that one. All I want to say is that I'm glad I didn't b/c that is too violent, and I am sure I would have been offended to the utmost.Save your money. This tripe should have never made it."
1,Worst movie ever,"Don't get me wrong, I love thrillers and mysteries.But this movie was just plain bad.I really don't understand what the fuss is all about.It's just a movie with a plot that's lacking almost every element of what makes an interesting thriller.Stay away."
4,Beautiful and unconventional love story.,"This movie is by turns thought-provoking, disturbing, beautiful, and scary. This film reminds me in many ways of ""Donnie Darko""- which is itself an only slightly more obfuscated love story. I watched the director's cut of ""Butterfly Effect"" before the theatrical release (Both are included on the DVD). I'm not sure which order would have been better. As it was the alternate ending in the director's cut left me slackjawed and a wee bit depressed. I do not count this as a bad thing; I like for movies to have an emotional impact. For those reviewers and critics that can't get past the fact that Ashton Kutcher is playing a serious role (and very well I might add) I say: GET OVER YOURSELVES! If you can't get past the fact that he was in ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" then you aren't doing your job as moviewatchers."
5,Wonderful,"This movie is a really good! I recommend everyone to watch it. It had me do a lot of thinking like, ""What if I were him?"" I've watched it so many times. BUY THE DVD. You won't be disappointed."
1,One Of The Worst Films I had Ever Seen!,"I can't believe it, all my friends told me this is a great movie ,so I watched the damn movie - HORRIBLE , what were they thinking? In years I haven't seen such a horrible movie with a tasteless-trying to be sophisticated script! Please! It didn't fooled me,It's just bored me! The reason this movie became a hit is only because Ashton Kutcher was in it! If it wasn't him in it, I'm sure those 300 and something reviews weren't so good!"
1,Knock Off,"A poor substitute for HG Wells ""A Time Machine"". Like ""War Games"" the only way to win was not to play. Alas, and not get the girl."
3,"Been using it for three weeks, but...","I thought serum by definition implies a more gel-like or watery texture; however, this particularly serum has the texture of cream. As a result, it seems like I have to use a lot of it to cover my entire face, which seems wasteful.As for the serum's brightening effects, I was hoping I would notice some difference in my skin's slightly uneven tones and spots by now, but I have been using it for three weeks straight (applying it twice a day) and have yet to see any noticeable change. It seems like with other brightening serums I've used in the past, the effects were evident after just a week of use.I was expecting much more effectiveness from this product. By now I was hoping to see more evenness and brightness in my skin tone. To be honest, I'm a tad disappointed."
4,yeah.,"Ditto to the first review.As the first reviewer pointed out, the pages of this bible are sewn. A minor rant on physical quality: A few weeks ago I started looking for a replacement for a worn out 25 year old bible (also NASB). Just about every hardcover bible I looked at, all versions, at Borders had pages glued to the spine, not sewn. This is _not_ _acceptable_ in a hardbound book that I'm going to be paying [$$] and up (sometimes way up) for and using continually. Even some of the leatherbound bibles were like this. Only Oxford and Cambridge seemed to be doing it the right way.I wouldn't call this type ""large print"". The maps could be nicer (in black and white, not color). The cover boards are covered with some kind of plastic (I'd rather they were cloth).At [$the price] this is a bargain."
3,Want Christian Spirituality?,"First, I am not a fan of Mr.Hunts, although I do agree with the basic premise of this book. Which is Christian Spirituality IS NOT the same as hindu, buddihist, wiccan etc. Unfortunatly, many modern Christians are turning to these false doctrines. Second, If anyone is interested in Christian Spirituality? check out (The Way of the Pilgram and The Pilgrim Continues His Way, The Cloud of Unknowing, The Monks of New Skete: In the Spirit of Happiness) All availible at amazon.com"
2,thought it would be better,"When I bought this stroller I was expecting good things. It looks nice and Fisher Price is usually a great name. (for toys, maybe not strollers)I was surprised at how many pieces there were and assembly was a bit time consuming. Once it was together it looked nice like in the store so we were excited again.However, after loading our little one's inside we found that steering was quite difficult. The stroller pushes nice when going straight, but steering is a different story.The handlebar sticks out far from the rest of the frame which makes it feel like it isn't so sturdy. There is a lot of ""up and down play"" in the handlebar and that concerns me.I think the weight is a bit much too. I expect a double stroller to be a little heavy, but my wife can barely get it in and out of the minivan which is not typical.Overall, I'd say it okay at best. Perhaps Fisher Price should stick to toys."
5,Awesome Double Stroller,"My husband and I LOVE this double stroller. We have an 8 month old and a 21 month old and it makes our life manageable. My daughter can sit or stand on the back, while my little one sits up front. Its easy to collapse and light weight for getting it in and out of my trunk. We use it everyday and can't imagine life without it!"
5,excellent results,"This is an amazing product. My female 7 yr old pug has been having UTI problems for 6 months, she has been to the vet countless times and over perscribed antibiotics, which made her sicker! They wanted to do 1200.00 worth of surgery on her, which she may not survive. I started her on uti free and within 1 week she stopped peeing all over the house, no more blood in her urine, and she voided a bladder stone. Clea is back to her old self! I still give her 1 dose a day, just for maintence, this was a god send! I would recomend this product to anyone who has a pet suffering from any urinary disorder."
2,did nothing,I can't say this helped much at all. Way over priced for the size and amount in the bottle. I followed the directions and saw no change.
2,Not worth the $,The strings were tangled to the point that I couldn't even use one string. I don't think the product is worth the price.
2,Big let down from previous works,This was a disappointment from what I was expecting based on her previous cd. Most of the songs sounded the same and lacked the energy from previous works. I might listen to it one more time to see if I missed anything from the first time.
2,Adios Perfection,"Starting back in the days of Chicken Shack, I always longed for more of Christine. Her first solo album was wonderful (please remaster than gem), the second divine--the tour she mounted to support that effort resulted in a night of bliss for this listener. I was so glad when Fleetwood Mac efforts with CMc made it to cd, so I could program the discs to just play her songs.And then there's this.What a disappointment. My guess is that there's a lot more to her not joining the reformed Mac. This is such a poor effort. The songs are commercial in a way that her fine tuned songs that reached artistic or commerical success never had to stoop. Christine, there was a period when we loved you. This cd was a tough break up for me, but it's just time to tell myself it's time to move on. Adios."
4,Great starting point for future books,"I was very impressed by this book since I have yet to find a fifth age one worth reading. The characters were very vibrant and well written I was especially pleased with the character of Valian Escu. The plot was well chosen and answered a question that many of us fans have been waiting to hear. I would highly recommend this book to any Dragonlance fan, especially those wanting to read about new characters."
3,a piece of my mind,How can a tomb raider game have an E rating. Its has to be non-action packed if it doesnt have the T rating. Take my advise an dont get this corny game.
2,This movie is WAY TOO SLOW.,I love stylized movies with stylized violence. This movie is just too slow (you have to have a lot of patience).
1,"The movie is a masterpiece, but avoid the DVD","The movie is a masterpiece worth 5+ stars, one of Kitano's best works. But I was totally dissapointed when I so that the subtitles where burned over the film, as a movie lover I consider this outrageous, the film beautifull cinematography is totally ruined by them. The quality of the DVD is not up to the level of the movie. I can't belive that to this date there are companies creating dvds with subtitles burned over a movie. Please wait and see if Criterion Collection eventually releases ""Hanna Bi"", they do respect movie lovers.The artwork is lousy, I don't know why they changed Kitano's beautifull artwork which is the original to the japanese release."
2,Handle is Uncomfortable,The way the carrying handle on this seat is rotated quickly becomes uncomfortable for your wrist.
4,Must have for raw,This memory card is a must have if you own a digital SLR and plan to shoot RAW format. You should be shooting raw if your are not.
2,Lexar Professional CompacFlash NO Wa !!!!,This is a good product as I already had one (bought another Lexar product for backup). But I wanted the Wa (Write Accerlation Option) as it shows in the discriptive picture to see the difference! I will never know if there is a difference and IF you want the newer version (that the Nikon D300 Manual shows) you may be disappointed...
2,Lexar 4GB,"I purchased two of these cards.The picture shows 4GB with WA (Writer Assist). However, when I received the cards they were 4GB, but missing the WA (Writer Assist logo). The old ""bait and switch"" technique is still alive.Anyway, rated this device 2 stars because it's not WA enabled."
5,Great Memory,I just began shooting RAW on the CANON XTI and I need the space this card provides. I can average about 400 pictures on this card... and will need to buy another one for longer outings away from computers.
4,picture,I found this to be more of a dreamer kind of a book than a practical how to book. It is older in its pictures and all but does give ideas for your future house!
3,tab book review,"Not very accurate tabs for the regular Johnny B Good song that everyone is so familiar with, there were many tabs for the B and I think high E string that were just different music from what is commonly thought of as Johnny B Good. Not very good tab music for that song anyway. The common version has lots of fill with major barr chords with pinky stretches, this tab music did not have this included."
1,Game Eater,I wanted to buy just the PS2 Vertical stand but I was convinced to buy this. It was cool at first but after a while it started letting the games spill out out and not returning them. Then it was s real pain to get out.
4,GREAT IDEA! A MUST HAVE!,"I recently bought this verticle tower for my playstation 2, and let me say it has made my life alot easier when it comes to finding my games and DVD's in a snap. The only problem i found with it was that if you dont put the CD's in securly to the slots, they will tent to fall inside the tower and it is hard to get them out. Otherwiae it is a great product. I would recoment buying it even if you do have a verticle stand, i keep my playstation 2 in a computer dest shelf, and i use the tower to hold my magazines and games, instead of holding my playstation 2! all in all i think it is a worthwhile product, i highly recomend it to everyone!"
1,This tower sucks!,ok when i first got ps2 i thought that this tower was going to be nice until it started to not give me my games back and scratch the living [...] out of them!
4,Great visually and a good story,"I thought this was an interesting story about a poet that also touched upon the immigration issue in Greece. The slow panning and single shots evoke beauty in scenes that Hollywood editing would miss. The film reminds me that we have been so habituated by the 3 second shot, that we are unsettled by the camera's deliberate lingering. We need films like this to slow things down again.The film absorbs the viewer because of its dreamlike images and light- diffuse scenes. I would have even been satisfied if the film was a series of wide, single shots and no dialogue.If you want or need a serious departure from Hollywood mind candy and cuteness, I recommend this film."
2,"Terrific collection, but the copy editor should be out of a job","I absolutely loved this book and have loved its author for many years, but this edition was terribly put together. Entire passages cut off mid-page, only to pick up several pages later when the author had already moved onto a different subject. In a longer title this wouldn't have been much of a problem, but with the short pieces I felt that I was missing the entire context of the essay. There were also several noticeable typos and grammatical errors. I'm sure this wasn't Walker's doing, so whoever copyedited/proofread this book should have been fired, especially considering the difficulties most people having with finding jobs. Other than that, this collection could not come more highly reccommended.-Shane Fallon, New York, NY"
4,Leaves you charged to make a difference,Walker brings her life experience and passion to this book. Each chapter was a bit disjointed - actually a separate log of events. Her tributes to those who have affected her life are excellent. I especially enjoy and agree with her love for Sweet Honey in the Rock. I finished this one more charged to make a difference in my community and with those I love.
2,"""Life and Death on the Internet' is better",This book is heavy on drama and light on solutions. Hype is probably the best word. 'Life and Death on the Internet' by Keith A Schroeder is a far better book and more effective.
4,Doesn't look like the picture,There is much more black on the braclet then is shown in the picture. Appears to be a form of weathering.
2,no surround sound inputs,"I didn't realize until I got everything all set up that there was not any inputs, except rca which doesn't give you surround sound. I can't get surround sound from my xbox or tv. It sounds good if you only watch dvds. I guess I'll take it back."
4,"Great songs, beautiful voice","I pretty much missed the James phenomenon--never owned any CD of theirs except ""Laid,"" which had made its way onto my discard pile. I stumbled onto ""Bone"" quite by accident, and was just blown away! Beautiful, evocative songs (""Fall in Love with Me"" really is as good as everyone says, and is worth the price of the CD) are delivered in Booth's exceptional voice. If there's a better male pop singer out there, I haven't heard him. My one gripe is that a couple of the tracks are over-produced. It's a minor flaw, though. Needless to say, I have rescued my copy of ""Laid"" and I'm working on acquiring the rest of the James oeuvre."
4,Stimulating and fun way to review conversational Chinese,"This package of Text Book and CDs for use at home and in car, bus, train, jet, boat - wherever you can play CDs - is clean, fun and efficient. You'll get warmed up on conversational topics painlessly and effectively.Not a great way to get Character review, but a good package for speaking fluently and idiomatically."
3,argh!,"Have been using the previous edition of this course to reboot dormant Mandarin. It's OK in itself, but the number of mistakes with the pinyin, the missing words in the dictionary and some really badly thought-out questions in the exercises are making me wish I'd gone for the ""Teach Yourself"" or ""Colloquial Chinese"" series instead.Perhaps the new edition has fixed all these things..."
4,helpful information,"This book has tons of helpful information, and do's and don'ts. I woukd have gave it 5 stars but parts seemed geared to upper managenent."
3,Neat Idea...poor quality,"We have many parties and I thought this machine was such a great idea to keep the blended drinks flowing. We used this for the first time at a party that had over 60 people. It worked great...keeping the margaritas flowing all night long. The problem?? The pitchers are made from very fragile plastic. When it came time to clean the machine the following morning, the margarita that had leaked out had gotten the pitcher stuck in the machine. With most good quality machines, a little muscle will free the pitcher up. Not this machine..the handle snapped off like a dried twig, shattering the whole pitcher. Wish they had made the pitchers with better quality plastic or glass so it lasted longer than one night."
3,VillaWare V5787 Double Smoothee Stainless Steel Bar Blender and Server,You have to make the smoothee's thin. If they are to thick you can't use the spout. You have to be careful if you move it because the on/off switch is on the sides and it can be turned on when you grab it. The price wasn't bad for a double blender so we just pour the drinks out instead of using the spouts.
3,GAME TOO STIFF,I OWN THIS GAME. THE GAME IS OK IF YOU LIKE THE BLOODY ROAR SERIES. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THAT THE PLAYERS DON'T HAVE A VARIETY OF MOVES. ONE PUNCH AND KICK BUTTON DOES GIVE YOU THAT MUCH OF AN OPTION IN FIGHTING GAMES. BUT ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT IT HAS GOOD GRAPHICS.
2,"Great game, but gets boring fast","Gameplay: Still the same as Bloody roar 1&2 gameplay turn into beast. The game has no slowdowns it runs at a blazing 60(fps) and has amazing lighting effects.Control: It just a button mashing game there is no direct moves it doesnt have very many combos it always does the same moves over and over againSound: The sound is terrible it needed a lot of work it didn't get all the characters talk soft and you can hardily hear them This needed more work than anything in the game.Graphics: Nice, but needs some work on the textures in the backgrounds the characters are nicely model, it just doesn't push the PS2 graphical power like it should.Fun Factor: It just doesn't offer much I recommend you buy a different game like Gran turismo 3 A-spec or something else"
3,Repetitive Fighting,"While being graphically superior to most fighting games produced to date for the PS2, the overall game play becomes repetitive. Unless you are a die hard fighting game fan, or have a great group of friends with nothing else to do than this, then i recomend just renting it on occasion."
5,Excellent way to introduce signing to little ones,"This product is recommended for babies starting at 10 months old, however my son has been watching it since he was 5 months old and he absolutely loves it. Since the first time I played it, he was fully engaged. There are many bright and bold colors that capture his attention and we love the classical music. I like how you are shown several different pictures and examples of a word such as a cat or dog and then you see the sign demonstrated by both an adult and a baby. It is too cute. I will definitely be purchasing more of these DVDs."
5,Great tool to use with a toddler,"As a nanny, we watched this video each day mid-morning. Olivia was 8 months at the beginning. She was fascinated by the images and sounds and would become quite animated. I could tell she was comprehending the signs, though she waited about a month before she started using the signs in day to day interaction. Given a choice of videos she would invariably choose ""First Signs"" first. It helped our communication and rapport at an earlier age than I had anticipated! Great Product! Can't wait to see the new DVD!"
4,"nicely done, engaging, but poor choice of words","I agree with the other reviewers about the limited selection of USEFUL words. The tutorial does advise you to pick only four signs and use them over and over again when the dvd is off. But it also says to play the dvd at least 4X a week. I just don't see how words like, ""dinosaur"" and ""horse"" would fit into everyday life, at least not in an urban area in the 21st century. ""Eat,"" ""more"" and ""drink"" are about the most useful signs in the dvd, with the runner-up being ""book."" I was surprised ""nap"" and ""potty"" wasn't included - wouldn't it be a DREAM if your child can tell you when he/she needs a nap or go potty???"
4,Good intro to sign language for parents and baby,"Our 8 month old just started viewing the dvd. It focuses too much on ""things"" (ie: duck, bear, cat) rather than action words but it is simple and a good start to learning sign language. It also moves very slow which is good for parents concerned about fast moving images/TV/video games but our baby seems to get bored after the 4th word. Over time his attention span should increase. My only other complaint is that the baby in the video does not do MOST of the signs correctly. Otherwise our baby enjoys the DVD.... of course it's too early to say whether he is actually learning the signs. But my husband sure is!"
2,kind of bland and boring,Baby Signing time is a much better video I highly recommend getting that one instead.
3,So-so,"This thing looks DISGUSTING now that we've had it for a while. I wash it all the time, but it certainly doesn't look like it. The water stains won't go away, & I'm embarrassed for anyone to even see it in my daughter's bathroom! The suction cups have separated from the part that goes in the tub, & I can't get them back in. Yes, it pads our knees but I'm looking for a new kneeling pad."
4,Great product,"I have a bad back and was worried about transitioning my son to the big tub, but with this mat I can stay on my knees for a long time with little to no bending over. It's great. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because if the pad gets wet it looks stained. I haven't tried wading it yet but I assume that will take the water spots out."
1,59.99?!,"Go buy it at Buy Buy Baby for $24.99, even better use a coupon and get it for $20. I can't believe it is being sold on here for $60"
1,Should have stuck with the original design,"I had this product for a couple of years and it was great, but overtime, got really dirty and was unable to be cleaned, so I decided to replace it. The new version is terrible! The suction cups don't stick to the bathtub and they replaced the pockets with a cheap flimsy material which doesn't hold the shampoo bottles. They definitely should have stuck with the original design, which is what is pictured but not what I received when ordered."
3,Expensive for what you get...,"This kneeler is pretty pricey for what you get. There isn't much padding and the pockets are too small to be useful. We haven't had it long enough to have the mold problems that other reviewers mention, but from what I read I am guessing we will have to get another pad in the near future."
3,Not Tall Enough,"This is a nice portable music stand, but it was not designed for a person 6'4"". At full height I am still looking down when I play my trombone. If only they would have added four more feet to it I will be able to look forward when playing. This stand is also difficult for placing a light on it too. I have to use my floor lamp. It sucks that most thing are made for the short people. I have to sit down to use it."
1,The writing is absolutely terrible,This book is one to take on the plane or the train. It is a study of very stupid people. Sante is truly evil but the people around her demand no respect or sympathy.The reader wonders why Irene didnt call the police and throw the son out? In the beginning he had made false statement that the lease was for three month when she knew it was for one month. She knew he was avoikding the security camera. did the bells go off?The author is not a good writer. To say the least!
4,My 5 year old loved it!,I got this for my 5 year old son and he loves it!My main reason for purchasing was that it is in Spanish and by the end of the day he was recognizing and repeating the instructions / words in Spanish.It's one of his favorite cartridges! I have to time his playtime with it because if I left it up to him - he'd be playing all day!Would highly recommend it!
1,Received the key of C instead of A,"The Harmonica sounds OK. The quality is average but I expected that for 8 bucks. The issue that I have with it is that I received a Bluesband Harmonica in the key of C, when I ordered it in the key of A.I already have a better harmonica in the key of C but it's too much of a hassle to send it back and have the correct one sent to me over an 8 dollar purchase.Unsatisfied to say the least."
4,Did you know...?,"Did you know that Banana Fish is one of Camui Gackt's -- the disturbing, Japanese singing sensation -- favorite manga. Yes, it is a shoujo, but Gackt loves it -- he said so in an interview.So, in addition to Banana Fish I would reccommend ""Under the Glass Moon"" which features a cameo appearance by Gackt and his former bandmate, Mana, from Malice Mizer. Some great music that. Enjoy your manga!I liked this manga because I'm easily amused by the shounen-ai hints and this manga has a few. I reccommend this manga if you also like shounen-ai hints, or the humor of Americans to Japanese."
1,difficult to fill,"well balanced, good feel - I can't tell you how it is with water in it since the space between the handle and the opening to fill is too small to get under ANY faucet. Maybe a hose without a sprayhead would fit but I wanted this for indoor plants. There are screws to remove the handle but given the small size I'd be doing that too often for usefulness."
5,It will keep you guessing till the very end.,"This book is great. It has so many real history facts and moments. It talks of a boy of 14 who sails on the Mayflower, to get to a new land called,America. Jasper goes through many hard times. He sees people die,and goes on a wild adventure into the woods where he meets the evil one. They say once you see him you will be killed or will you. To find out this and more just read this book."
5,Simply Amazing!,"After seeing this toy in the mall, I just had to order it from Amazon for my daughter. It's like a toy you can't put down and figuer out. It's simply amazing how he designed and fit all the pieces together. An architects dream, a childs wonder! After 6 months, we still enjoy picking it up, rolling it and watching it collaps and expand."
5,Great toy...I loved it too!,Seems like a great toy! Had been eyeing it for a while and finally bought two of them. I anticipate hours of fun after Christmas.
3,The toddler proof,It works but when my four year old started playing with it had jammed up in about 10 minutes. It's really for older folks.
3,Not what i expected,"The smell is nice but i feel my hair more dry .And your scalp dosent feel clean, i was expecting more results from it."
5,"Well, I loved it!","I agree with the ""low lather"". You seem to need more than regular shampoo to saturate your hair. However, using this AND the conditioner made my hair sooo soft and smooth. I absolutely love how it smells. I've actually gotten compliments from people in public asking what I shampooed with. It's great!"
5,Inspirational Truth!,"I just finished reading this book and I have so much more faith in God ! Hagin explains step by step on how to get your prayers answered by God. He also uses his own personal experiences to back up his teachings that will empower you to change the way you are praying. He also describes the different types of prayers and when to use them, such as dedication prayers and praying in agreement. I also liked how he used bible verses and expalined them sraight and to the point!This book is a must read to anyone and everyone who needs help with their prayers and also in their walk with God!This book is empowering, inspiring, and truthful.A must read!"
5,Perfect,"My son spent 3 months sleeping in his cradle with this bedding set. It was perfect, and we have carefully saved it for our next child. The colors are the best, and didn't clash with the decor in my own bedroom (where our son sleeps until the new addition is finished!!) as the pattern isn't overly bold or large."
1,"Pointless, tedious movie","This was perhaps the worst movie I have seen in a decade. Extremely slow plot, no storyline, and an ending that literally seemed as if they just ran out of money and had to cut it off."
4,good resource,"i needed this book for school, and it did the job i learned tons of effect tricks through this book."
2,Not good enough!,"This book has left me much unimpressed.The actual battle has been given second place.The book is full of photos, many of them of poor quality and repeated several times, giving the impression of being just padding. This goes for many of the diagrams.But the most disappointing feature is that the proof reader must have been a blind junior student of English. The typos are just incredible and leave a black mark on the editors."
4,Coral Sea,Not a bad book. Simple and easy to understand. Many photos. I was suprised at the number of typos. Simple mistakes but they did (for me) detract from the book.Definitely a book for a younger reader to build their interest and knowledge of Coral Sea.I recommend.
2,3rd part is better!!,not a good story - just a massacre!but watch part 3 - thats on my point of view the best of the fdtd-trioligy!
5,A REALLY STELLAR BAD MOVIE,I LOVED THE FAKE EFFECTS AND THE BAD DIALOG. I EVEN LIKED THE BEGINING IN THE ELEVATOR. OVERALL A GREAT BAD MOVIE
1,Not worth it!,"This is one of the cheesiest, most low-budget movies you'll ever come across, doesn't hold a candle to the original! Run far away from this stinker!"
2,Don't waste your time,"This book has really helpful advice such as "" smile at strangers"" or "" remember birthdays"". This was hardly anything new or novel, or anything that Miss Manners hasn't been teaching for years.I got this book at the library and I am soooo glad I didn't waste my money on it. The retail price was $17.00. It possibly could be a value of $5.00 The pages are filled with a lot of space. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but I really don't think it's anything we haven't heard before. It could be summed up with "" be nice to others"". I am actually surprised it got such good reviews by people before me!"
4,"Good, fast service",The product arrived in good shape in good packaging. Got here sooner than expected. I would buy from this vendor again.
4,Frustrating!,"Already a fan of Lewis' Space Trilogy, I was pleased to find this book in the mid 70's. It was easy to see where the book was intended to fit (between books one and two) and the plot developed well enough that I often wonder why Lewis abandoned it. The most frustrating times are when, right as you are getting interested in the action, the announcement appears, ""The manuscript breaks off here..."" Sometimes I wish some skilled writer would be intrepid enough to attempt to finish it, but in my more lucid moments I realize that it is best left just as it is.The quality of the other short stories is uneven, but gives more insight to Lewis' dry sense of humor, profound imagination, and his ""secular side.""This book is a ""must read"" for fans of C.S. Lewis' writing."
4,Interesting,"My 3-1/2 year old daughter received this for Christmas. She is fascinated with magnets. There are a couple of quite powerful magnets, some medium ones and some weak. She particularly likes the magnetic balls, and is intrigued with the polarity of all of the magnets. I like that this gift is educational. It has an activity book that we have used a couple of times. It's not necessarily her favorite toy, but she enjoys playing with it."
3,are you kidding,expected to receive 3 removers for the price...only got 1 for $7 omg next time I will get a free one from the dr's office
4,Just What I Needed!,"The DMV ULTRA Hard Contact Lens removers are fantastic. Few people seem to wear hard contact lenses anymore ---I certainly wouldn't be, if my doctor didn't insist---and I find the ""pull-and-blink"" removal system kinda hit-and-miss. These DMV removers make taking the things out quick and easy. I recommend them for anyone wearing hard contacts."
4,Handy Little Plunger,"I'm giving 4 stars cause I use the thing ALL the time. I could never get used to popping my hard contact lenses out with my eyelid, trying to grab the contact, or whatever other way my Optometrist recommended trying.Personally, I think it's a little pricey for one, but it was worth the comfort of not having to put my finger any closer to my eye than I have to. It definitely works and I bought a few just in case I lost one."
4,A GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE,I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA AT BEST BUY ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO AND I GAVE ABOUT 3 TIMES THE PRICE IT IS NOW. BUT I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED IT. EVERYTIME MY FAMILY NEEDS PICTURES TAKEN OF ANYTHING THEY WANT ME TO TAKE THEM OR TO BORROW MY CAMERA. BECAUSE THE PICTURES ARE SO CLEAR AND ALWAYS TURN OUT GOOD. THESE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ANY CAMERA THEY USED. BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THERE ARE GOOD AND BAD ONES IN EVERYTHING YOU BUY. I HAVE TRULY ENJOYED MINE AND AM NOW BUYING ONE FOR MY MOTHER FOR CHRISTMAS TOO.
1,First Experiences It's Potty Time,"Terrible!! The pages are to busy, to much happening on the page, patterns, writing, pictures. Shows you what a potty is NOT for, really not a good idea for children to see a child putting the potty on her head! The text is hard to follow, not sure where to read. I am so disappointed."
1,Not enough!,"This book does not cover the necessary information needed to pass the exams. It does not even mention printing, which is a big part of the exam. Used without any other aid, you would need a lot of luck to pass the exams."
1,Use the exam cram book,I did not like this book. It does not mention printing anywhere. It seams that the book was rushed to press to quickly. In some spots is says Solaris 8 where it should say Solaris 9.
1,Don't confuse this with a good book,"Please do not confuse this book with Parenting the Strong-Willed Child by Forehand & Long. Parenting the Strong-Willed Child is an excellent book and one that as a child clinical psychologist specializing in parenting, I have recommended to many families. Forehand & Long's book teaches HUMANE methods, supported by over 30 years of careful, thorough research."
1,Rediculous,"""Spare the rod, spoil the child"" does NOT refer to a switch with which to hit your children, rather it refers to a shepherd's crook which one should use to gently guide their children, as a shepherd does his flock. Dobson can't even properly decipher his Bible, and he expects thinking individuals to take his advice on child-rearing? Asinine!"
4,The coolest NBA game of the year,"I have to say Electronic Arts has pulled it off again. NBA Street is the best basketball game you'll find out there for the PS2. The gameplay is really good , Graphics look very sharp , but as for the commentary I had to turn it off while I was playing because it was really horrible. Overall I give NBA Street 4 stars for that reason but it's still a lot better than NBA Live. So if you have a PS2 and your looking for a basketball game I highly recommend this game for you."
5,Sweet game!!!,when i rented this game i knwe it would be a game like NBA Jam. i was right. only this game was much better. the graphics were amazing and the game play was just so much fun. i knew i had to buy this game. If you like basketball then you will love this game. After playing it once and then twice and the for a third time then i was addicted. and believe me this game is addicting. Get this game. it definately has a a place in my heart.
3,"Good not great, still the most complete book I've read on the subject.","Good book, not great. The beginning of the book starts off really strong with the technical tools people use to win elections. About midway through the book it starts to give really vague overviews of public relations tactics. I can't recall the book mentioning anything about brand image, which in my opinion, is very important to any campaign. I would recommend buying this book with, Making News by David Henderson, The Boston Consulting Group on Strategy, Public Relations by Bernays, and a good text on branding and brand management."
1,Avoid!,"Too many problems:1. Poor picture quality and faint, hissy sound at startup. Have to run Autoscan several times to correct, each and every time it's turned on.2. Skips numerous known channels. No way to override and bring them in.3. When picture quality finally corrects, sound and pic aren't synched (a few seconds delay)4. Remote sometimes works, sometimes doesn't5. Gets ""stuck"" on channel 2. Won't advance to next up, but will go back.6. Apparent poor customer service: Sent email to vendor, got auto ackn of my email, but nothing further.Too many hassles. Back it goes for a refund."
1,Deja Vu,All the same public domain 10th generation quality from passport video. How many companies can put out this stuff all the time in such dire quality
2,Much Ado,"My husband gave me this book for my birthday. It was the only book I took with me on a business trip to Vancouver. I REALLY wanted to like it. I actually wanted to love it. I was completely frustrated by it: not the language, which I found the most interesting part of the whole thing. I just thought the characters were smug and full of themselves and the mystery wasn't very compelling and all the good stuff happened in between the chapters. And if Du Pre went out to see if the wise old Benetsee had come home ONE MORE TIME I think I would have started ripping pages out of the damn thing. Bowen needs to write a book about the music of the Metis (the only exciting parts of the book were when Du Pre and Bassman and Pere Godin were playing their music) and forget about the ""mystery"" since he's not any more involved in it than we aren't."
3,Plato is not my King,"Plato doesn't make people fight. He makes people think about why bad people should be eliminated. I like when he says ""Yes, I agree"" but I get mad when he yells at people. I like in the pictures when he's talking with his hands and wearing those sheets. In one story, Plato was in trouble for hurting the youth and they found him guilty. I think it's sad that he had problems getting along with the law, but maybe he should have thought twice before doing all his corrupting."
1,Nonsense,"Stupid book really for the greatest philosopher of all time. And what are those cartoons all over the book? Buying it is a waste of money and reading it, a waste of time. Sorry."
4,Excellent assistance,"This book definitely prepares you for the test by giving you actual questions and answers and explanations for both. This should be used with other material such as Transcenders and you should have no problem passing the test. The author could have included more questions per page, but overall a great guide."
1,New formula smells terrible!,"I've used this product for years and really liked it. When the re-forumlated it to make it more ""natural"" my local store stopped carrying it. I ordered 4 12 ounce bottles thinking they would last me for years as I only use it on my head after shaving. The new formula has a terrible chemical odor like some kind of plasticizer. If you are shopping for aloe gel, look elsewhere! This stuff stinks!"
2,Big and Clunky,"You get what you pay for....... I wouldn't have bought these if I could have put my hands on them. Actually the handles are OK, although maybe a little large for a woman's hands. The blades are way too thick for my liking. Typical Chinese quality."
2,Illegible font,"Ignoring the normal quibbles anyone would have with anthologies' selections is easy when you check out Payne and Hunter's volume--or, rather, try to check it out. Like others in the Blackwell series, _Renaissance Literature_ is rendered useless by its size print: far too small to be seen comfortably for even a moment, far FAR too small if you'd like to read, say, _The Faerie Queen_. Not recommended, not recommendable."
3,Meat Smoking and Smokehouse Design,"Ok. Not bad, but pretty basic and can the get information off the web for free. Luckily I got a good deal on Amozon as I wouldn't want to pay full price. Still interesting."
4,Quality book,"The book I bought, ""Meat Smoking and Smokehouse design"" is really valuable as it gives detail about meat chemistry and process intelligence. Combined with Internet Research one can come up with a solution for either a old school smokehouse or a modern one. I learnt a lot about micro-organisms active in meat, something books with recipe's only does not cover. I am happy with my purchase"
2,What I paid for...,"I was initially very excited at the prospect of getting such a classy looking set of knives for so little. Then, they arrived in my mailbox.Seeing them myself, I found them to look cheap. the blades weren't alligned properly, the handles felt awkward and hollow, and furthermore, I couldn't get them sharpened. I even got a different sharpening stone than what was included with the set and gave that a try. no luck. the entire piece felt loosely contructed, as though it would fall apart if I wasn't careful.I did, however, get a couple of knives for Christmas. I got an OXO good grips chef's knife and two wusthoffs. I found these knives to be far superior and although I know that they are expensive, but they are exceptional. (also got shining reviews in Chef's magazine.) Some of the finest kitchen tools that I own.I'm getting rid of my Sabatier Prosteel set."
2,"Not worth it, unless you want cheap knives","I was attracted by the price but disappointed once I ordered them. As one of the reviewers said, the design is not good. If you don't use them often ,but like to show off this item, this looks good in the kitchen. Overall the knives are not good."
1,Worse than expected,I've had these steak knives for four years. One cannot be used anymore. The others show rusting on the cutting edge. These knives were washed in the dishwasher. They are comparable in quality to a starter steak knife set I bought at Walmart around the same time.
4,Comfortable stylish shoe,Very comfortable stylish shoe for work i had to order a larger size as it is a narrow fit and I have a broad foot but I love the shoe great to wear all day at work.
2,Too narrow!,"While these shoes may look nice, they are way too narrow. I do have a somewhat wider foot so these shoes are clearly for someone with an average to narrow foot!"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,I love these loafers so much that they are my second pair! My first pair I wore out after 7 years. I wore a hole into them!
4,Best Shoe EVAR,"This is the only shoe I have ever found where 9.5 fits perfectly, right out of the box. It's a sturdy walking shoe, and my first pair of these got me all over southern Scotland in 2009. Well, not ALL over, but enough. It holds up well, cleans up well and looks good with everything. I've bought my second pair, and I might just buy another to keep on hand when the second wears out in a year or two."
2,Bocca Bust,"I have 3 pairs of these loafers that I bought in 2004. I wear them so often and like them so much that I decided to buy more now that the originals are wearing out. So, off to the internet to find them, and to my amazement they are still available. I ordered 2 more pairs - oh the anticipation! However, I was so disappointed in the quality and feel of the new shoes that I sent them back! The quality has clearly gone down in the last several years - it's as if it's not even the same shoe. The amount of padding in the insole seems much thinner, and they are not nearly as comfortable overall. So, the quest for the perfect loafer begins again."
2,Franco Sarto is cutting corners :(,"First, I have to say, I love Franco Sarto shoes, and this is my 5th (yes 5th!) pair of this shoe. I walk long distances to work, and they are very comfortable and stylish (compared to walking downtown in gym shoes!).Over the years I noticed the leather getting a bit lower in quality. This particular recent Franco Sarto shoe purchase is rather poor. The leather nearly looks like pvc, the inside is now all fake leather, it smells bad, makes your feel smell and slip & slide. The bottom insole is very cheap, glued in poorly. The material is ""pleather"", smells bad, makes your feet sweat and smell bad, in addition to a slip & slide type of feel. The heel is seems to be painted a slightly different black compared to the leather.Overall, Franco Sarto's cost cutting is very noticeable. As much as I love this shoe, this will be my last pair. I understand keeping prices constant, but I would have rather paid the $10-20 more and had a better quality, truely ""all leather"" shoe."
2,Wide in the heel,"Nice looking loafer, but the narrow was still too wide in the heel. I had to return them, but I was disappointed. They would look great with pants."
4,Remington Replacement Screens & Cutters,"This was just what I needed to extend the life of my Remington shaver. The parts were easy to remove and replace. I can't say much about the shaver/cleaning unit. This is just to keep you buying supplies and adding to Remmington's profits. The first shaver cleaning unit cracked and leaked cleaning fluid all over our counter top. The free replacement cleaner cracked, and did the same thing. So far, the shaver is running a year or so without the cleaning unit. The replacement screens and cutters will probably last longer than the shaver. Oh, and another thing, the shaver no longer recharges, and I have to use the cord. The battery only lasted a few years."
2,Plays on PC,"For those like me who don't know or didn't think, this ""HDNet"" DVD plays on your PC, if you have the ability to hook your PC up to the TV it would be great. Not worth the price, it's only about a 30 minute workout but is fun."
5,An Excellent Starting Point,"The book provides practical advice and suggestions. I found the comprehensive check list of all the things that must be considered prior to startup quite useful. Also helpful are the phone numbers and addresses for various MD, VA, and DC government and economic development offices.The book is a great resource relative to making sure that you don't overlook things that could be critical to your business. For example, I found the section of hiring and firing enlightening relative to potential impact on a new company's unemployment compensation rate. Who would know that the IRS would make your company chargeable for the unemployment claims of an ex-employee who voluntarily leaves for another job and gets fired after a few weeks.I would highly recommend the book to anyone starting a small business. It is well organized and a quick read. It helps you know what questions to ask and who to ask. It is not intended as an in-depth resource book."
3,this is nothing special,"each page appeared to be to busy, which made me exhausted, not motivated for whatever of interest on that page. there were not going to be any hidden secrets, so the art work and written contents could have been played with more to see how to catch a readers eye , who had been there and done that. i think with some help on these things the book will be of value to someone with back conditions."
2,Back Sufferers' Bible,"Fabulous book, very informative, easy to read and all the exercises work to improve your back problems.Patti Wilson"
2,Overpriced for what it is,"Honestly I don't like this knife and its almost entirely due to the handle. I found the handle uncomfortable and the balance to be off. The fact that this is a stamped blade, as opposed to forged, also didn't help matters any. At the price they are asking for this chef's knife I'd expect a forged blade at the very least. Honestly, I'd pass on this over priced and overly trendy knife for the Wusthof Grand Prix at the same price or a bargain chinese cleaver."
3,Just the Basics,"This is once of those books that seems like it's tailored just for the breed, but it's just a generic book. Sure it has the history of the RR, but it doesn't have the tips that you can get from speaking to owners and breeders. Worth the cheap price, but do your own research and take in as many sources as possible before making decisions."
4,"Less brilliant, more honest","This book is not as challenging as Stiglitz, and the author does not have Stiglitz's dazzling facility with economic theory. But Rosen is properly less trusting of the political process, gives greater scope to political and ethical philosophy, is open to a wider range of ideas and has more references than Stiglitz, is less prone to rush to judgement, and is less beholden to the Clintonista viewpoint. This is the better book upon which to ground a sound understanding of public economics. Compare Rosen with Stiglitz on the Coase Theorem, the Flat Tax, the economic role of the stock market, and Social Security reform. Too bad Rosen's fairness cannot be combined with Stiglitz's brilliance."
4,GREAT LITTLE THING!,"THE VEO CONNECT HAS GREAT PICTURE QUALITY AND THE BEST PART ABOUT IT IS IT DOES'NT TAKE UP ANY SPACE. WHEN I OPENED THE BOX I THOUGHT I MADE THE WRONG ORDER BECAUSE IT'S SO SMALL IT LOOKS LIKE A TOY, NEEDLESS TO SAY I LOVE IT, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE THING!"
1,My Suggestion: Leave it!,"Okay, so I got this webcam a few years ago as a gift, which is nice 'cause I don't have to buy it. BUT THE QUALITY IS HORRIBLE!! Now that more and more web cameras are coming out, better quality ones are of reasonable prices.Move on, get a better web camera. This one's getting TOO old.For one thing, I had to have MAXIMUM light everytime I use it - which is hard when you're online at night when all you have is your room light, which is usually not as bright as the sunlight. Then even when there's maximum light, all you could see is basically outlines! you can't see details in the picture, which sucks.So... for any purposes, personal or business, DO NOT buy this camera because you will just cry in regret.Oh and the prices says it all ;)"
4,Where can you find a good game,Ephemeral Fantasia is a very fun and interesting RPG game through this decade. The reason is it completely explain the reason for playing a video game. But the main reason to buy it because of it's great story line and amazing graphic. Because a anime artist I'm sure this is my type of my game....I myself only buy anime style video game. That's why I recommend it rather than other kind of video games.
5,An Excellent Title!,"This game is wonderful! It's one of the most original and innovative titles released in a long time. I don't understand why everyone is saying the game is ""too difficult""...what's the point if there isin't any challenge? Konami is at the forefront of iconoclastic video games and they're doing an amazing job! Yes, the game is repetitive in the fact that the same week repeats, but each week there is a new objective. Some characters can only be recruited after the 3rd or 4th loops (and they're worth the wait!). If you want an easy game, something with SquareSoft-like graphics, and/or a storyline that fits into a neat conformist box, this game isin't for you. However, if you're ready for a challenge, anime-style graphics, and an imaginitive plot, buy this now!"
1,HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the hardest rpg's ever made! it relies on time,the battle system is tough,and the music minigame sucks! If you want a rpg do not get this! there much better rpgs out there!"
4,"AFFIRMING, ENLIGHTENING ADVICE","Monique's book is a thought-provoking, sister-loving guide that will help those seeking guidance to new mind-sets, techniques and tools to re-affirm their self-worth as well as help them get their personal, financial and professional lives together. The book could've used more references to parenting and to relying on faith/God, but Ms. Greenwood's book is a great start on the journey to a new life. For those seeking spirituality, they won't find it here, but this is still a worthwhile read."
5,An Awesome Read!,"This is a wonderful book!!!! An excellent addition to your ""must read"" booklist! It is filled with encouragement, wisdom, and action steps for a more meaningful life. I absolutelly enjoyed it! I order this book a month before it was available (I read the review in Black Issues) and was NOT disappointed when I received it. As I read the book (over the weekend), I was motivated and encouraged to continue focusing on my dreams, to keep balance in my personal world, and reminded to work on maintaining joy in my journey. The book is well-written, easy to read, and filled with ""tried and proven"" success steps to follow from a woman who considers herself ""ordinary."" Well, she has accomplished some extraordinary things! Sure does make me proud to be called woman! Buy this book! You won't regret it! Oh yeah, much joy in your journey!"
5,Swain to the Moon!,"Mathew Swain, smells trouble on a so-called ""perfect"" lunar colony and finds plenty of it in this second in the series by Mike McQuay. These old pulp paperbacks from the early eighties are a lot of fun and they all feature great artwork on the covers."
2,find another racing game,"no comparison to gran turismo 3, graphics are shakey and the sound is terrible, wish i hadn't bought this game"
1,This game rots!,Decent Graphics. The worst gameplay I've ever seen. This game looks like the engine comes from a starwars game. The car glides above the pavement. There is no tire contact feel at all. Mine will be on E-bay very soon.
1,Too Expensive for what it is,"Graphics are fine, but so limited, the cars dont sufer any damage when they crash, pit stops you dont see nobody, there is only 3 types of views you cant see if you have a car beside you, this game needs to be updated or patched soon, because is not a big deal at all"
1,Worst racing game I have played,"I played this game for about 20 minutes and it sucked from the beginning. Maybe I didn't play it long enough but shouldn't a game impress you from the beginning? The load times where unusually long and the graphics were less than impressive. I was hoping this would be similar to GT3 but it is no where near. In short, rent this one first and judge for yourself."
1,blade not sharp - pulling hair,"I usually like Remington products but this hair clipper is horrible. The blade seemed to be dull from the beginning and always pulled hair. We followed the instructions with oiling the blade, etc. but it still is not getting any better.I would not recommend getting this clipper."
3,Cheap Guide Combs,"It's a great trimmer. I've had one for two years, still cuts like new. The problem is the guide combs break, EASILY! and you can't buy just a replacement for the one you use. You have to buy a set of 6 different ones for $6.00, when you only need the one. Which WILL break again.After the last one broke, I bought a different brand with better guide combs. I kept the Remington for the dog, he's not particular!"
3,"Blade worked for about 15 hair cuts, can't find replacement blade","The first few times I used the clippers they worked just fine. But after about 15 hair cuts the blade wasn't very sharp anymore. It took forever and pulled on the hairs. It's not worth the hassle. If you're looking for a quick ""disposable"" set of clippers these are the ones for you."
2,Cheap and simple. You get what you pay for.,"I bought this cam off ebay for $11.00 delivered. I installed it in about 5 minutes, from opening the box to seeing the first image. The problem with this cam is that it does not work in low light. All I got was a big dark moving blob. With lots of light, it works great. But, without light, good luck!"
1,Problems with the vault,"Before buying this product, try searching on-line and you will find many, including myself, who have found the vault to work for a short period of time, and then fail to open. It provides the correct tone that recognizes that the unit should open, but it doesn't. This seems to be an issue among many people that have purchased the item. My child was very dissapointed."
1,I cook for a livin'...,"I bought this...my mistake.This is one of the most beautiful Santoku knives ever made from one of the most beautiful Sabatier lines ever made.Stamped steel blade (a very good steel I might add), laser bonded to the handle, a very comfortable grip...and sharp as a razor. I mean really sharp!!! BUT...The blade shape is almost unusable!!! The point actually hooks back down at the tip and gets stuck in a cutting board! The edge is NOT curved nearly enough to rock and roll...unbelievable! unusable! I had to take a coarse whet stone and re-shape the tip of this knife before I could use it for any purpose...quite a disappointment. I dumped it!We smack this beastie boy with a single mojo* if only for it's beauty."
4,"Review of video through the Library Journal, www.libraryjournal.com","My House, Your House: A Guide to Inspecting Your Home Purchase! Tabak who operates TBK Inspections llc in North Carolina takes the viewer through his process, beginning with building lot and exterior walls. He progresses to the roof, crawlspace, attic, and interior. His main tool is a powerful flashlight. The subject house is made of brick, with some aluminum siding on a low concrete block foundation, which is perhaps not typical enough. Tabak is thorough, explaining what to look for and why, but an overall assessment would also have been helpful. He does note the need of various repairs that would lower a buyers offer. During the first segment the camera operator stays on Tabak instead of showing walls and windows he is examining. All the same, this program contains valuable information for any home buyer at a very reasonable price. Recommended for public libraries. David r. Conn, Surrey P.L.B.C."
3,Missing top cap,"pros:- Great coffee flavorcons:- It's kind of small. The 4 cup, in my experience, are only enough for 2 people.- It takes some time for the coffee to get ready. I think some 15 minutes, which is more than I'd expect- The top cap from this image [...] is missing."
5,Size matters,"The four cups for this model refer to really really small espresso cups. The amount of water you can put in the coffee maker is very small: 2/3 cup (US cooking measurement). There is room for more water, but the Brikka system makes it so that you can't fill up the whole thing with water."
5,All good thanx,"Yu Gi Oh DVD received with thanks. Good price, good product, fast postage, kids love it! Thanks for the service."
4,"Pretty good, for clip art","This book has a good selection of classic tattoo designs, and I would consider it a good value for the price. The artwork is good, not amazing, but certainly adequate. Each design is offered in color and in linework. If you're looking for a good, all-purpose book of flash, and not necessarily a lot of authentic Sailor Jerry stuff, this book (and CD ROM!) is a good choice."
4,Sirius Home Kit..,Got this for my partner as a christmas gift and we both loved it... (It works very well and was easy to set up)... Defintely a great buy for all you Sirius users.
4,Fabulous,"The product meets all my expectations and more, this is a great radio home kit. I get exceptional reception in my area."
5,Completely Satisfied,"I plugged the unit in, and hooked the audio into the subwoofer of a set of computer speakers.Sounds great. The adapter is solid design. I put the antennae on top of my computer desk, and reception is 2 bars through the roof with no breaking up. ( I did have to orient it at first )."
5,Easy peasy.....,"Great accessory for my Sirius receiver. Easy as 1,2,3 to integrate into my Audio system at home allowing me to listen whereever I am."
1,Defective out of box - Amazon reports frequent problems,"Item was defective out of box - no power to radio through dock. Radio works fine when connected to AC directly; the dock has some defect that disrupts power.Contacted Amazon for replacement but I was informed that Amazon has placed the product under review due to the high number of complaints received about product being defective. Every product has a few go bad, but the high numbers here suggest a wider problem."
1,Don't waste your money!,The base and cords are fine. The home antenna is horrible at getting reception. I had to pull the car antenna and use that instead to get anything over 4 out of ten bars on the radio. With the car antenna in the same spots I received all ten bars of reception.
2,Measure First!,"I bought this as an accessory to the radio that I purchased as a birthday gift for my boyfriend.Boy, were we disappointed!The antenna MUST be outside pointed at the sky for any kind of decent reception.The cord was way too short to get the antenna outside.Just ridiculous! Why would they not include a cord long enough for the average home?We had to turn around and pay another $30+ to get an extension cord for the antenna that came with the Home Kit that supposedly provided you with everything you needed to set it up. Not!"
1,Just one man's opinion,"Not only was this book homophobic, the whole book was fiction strung together with quotes and studies that are not footnoted. Some of the studies I recognized and have been debunked. This is not to say that the topic is not a worthy one for discussion. However, the book was boring and amaturish. I was expecting the caliber of Jared M. Diamond or Sperm War by Robin BakerA heterosexual male"
2,Good if you know little,"""Why geography matters"" did not deliver according to me. Though it may be very interesting for people not very familiar with geography and how it does matter in ordinary life as well as for global issues, it seemed to me anyone a bit aware of these very issues will not learn much."
1,Didn't last long,What a waste of money. Try buying something else. This lasted me only a couple of months.
1,Imitation Sabatier,"I purchased this set of knives knowing they weren't top of the line, but I certainly expected better. They are made in China, dull, and difficult to sharpen. (...) I would expect better descriptions (...) so that people could make a better decision. Hard to believe anyone would have the guts to put (such a high) MSRP (...) on this quality of knives."
2,Sabatier? Well . . . not really,"I currently own both Sabatier (trumpet) and Wustof-Trident (Grand Prix). This set is not made in Theirs, France as other Sabatier, rather China. The block is not oak, but maybe Pine with oak veneer. Although there is a full tang on the knives, the grinding (stamping) marks are left on the blade of the knives. I haven't had them long enough to determine whether they can keep an edge. The feel of the knives is satisfactory as the handles a very comfortable. The balance of the knives is also comfortable.Listing these as knives that would originally cost over [amount] is not quite appropriate."
4,Good for the price,"I paid $... for this set, and they're good knives for that price. I don't do a whole lot of cooking, so I haven't had a chance to see if they develop any problems, but so far they're great. The balance is wonderful, I like working with them. My only complaint is the construction of the block that holds them; the front part appears to be sloppily glued to the back part, resembling a junior high woodshop project. I've seriously seen better constructed ones at .... However, that's the only problem I have with the knives so far, and for $...I'm not complaining! If you cook a lot or are picky about your cutlery I would suggest shelling out more money for nicer stuff, however for those of you who cook sporadically and want a decent set of knives without breaking the piggy pank, this is the set for you!"
4,"The distinct, distinguished Catholic voice from the South","I haven't read anything by Flannery O'Connor since ""All Things That Rise Must Converge."" I fell in love with her stories. There is so much life in them. I read this work to get an idea about her ""sitz im leben"", her life-situation, her milieu. A lot of it is correspondence, and there are some presentations as well. I am wondering if it speaks to the modern would-be novelist as much as it spoke to writers of her time and place. She says that one needs to write out of the context of where you are: the place, the people, the geography. This is mandatory, not optional.This book is for writers. I appreciate her writing about how to be Catholic in the South, a very small minority. She has contributed much to finding faith in the stories of life, even violent and brutal stories. I look forward to my next work of hers."
3,Non-fiction for writers,"O'Connor's fiction is delightful. This work provided insights into her own thinking and life that I probably could have spared myself. She comes off a bit arrogant at times. The quality of the writing is, of course, superb."
4,yep I got one,"I have one and acquired it as a gift years ago, the quality is very high...funny thing it requires hours of sharpening or a grinder, the steel is so hard you could use it as a pry bar.the lanyard hole is brass fitted and robust, the sheath is ok but leather is not very good in damp arears so mine is pretty much ruined.also it has a rubber handle with finger grooves... this is in my opinion the best Ka-Bar clone.however the much cheaper Frost Cutlery one cost half as much and is also quite good and more genuine."
4,comercial zone,the smoker is great .i was a gift .whitch was wel recieved./ it saves a lot of mess. and it also may save them from burning down the house thanks
3,Too small,really SMALL..never knew they made one that small!It was more standard looking on the product page.really should read the info for closely
1,Unable to use,"I've always liked Sanus products however, this was received in an obviously repackaged box and was missing all parts except the actual shelves. I was extremely disappointed that Amazon shipped something that was an obvious return without checking it out. In addition UPS left it out in the rain even though someone was home so the box was soaked. I do want to commend the customer service person that I dealt with who promptly credited my account"
3,"Nice Stand, but Center Channel Speaker Height is Limited","I like Sanus as a company, their customer support has always been great. This stand is relatively well built, made in Taiwan, with one caveat, the metal cylinder supports aren't perfectly plum, but they still work.The pictures don't show it, but Sanus has added an additional steel support beam that spans the width of the stand, directly below the front of the top shelf. Good in theory, but it reduces the usable height of the middle shelf a couple inches, which meant my center channel speaker wouldn't fit!"
2,"Good reference, but needs an update.","Although this is a good reference book, the march of technology has left this book is quite dated. Ted Harwood refers to MetaFrame 1.0 while version 1.8 has been out for quite some time. Citrix will be releasing 2.0 soon after Microsoft releases Terminal Server with Windows 2000 Server on February 17. The brief reference to integration into a Netware environment does not describe the updates that Novell have released to ensure compatibility of NDS for NT TSE and MetaFrame."
2,Not thrilled with abridgements,"This collection is advertised as unabridged, and that is just false. I haven't been too happy with the abridgements, nor with the readers, especially the reader for Lasher. I remember loving these books when reading them, but the audio version is just so-so with the abridgements. If I were you, I would buy the books if it is at all possible."
4,JUST LIKE THE ARCADE,"If you liked the games when they were in the arcades, then you will enjoy this game. The only draw back is the games that used to have a rollar or ball to control (Pong), are tricky until you get the hang of it with a joy stick. Worth having in your collection for the money!"
2,"The description ought to say ""for decorative purposes only""","This product is good because you can make your kitchen look complete for just fifteen smackers. It's also nice because it includes a block, so you have a place to put decent knives as you grudgingly purchase them one at a time.The blades are not ground in a way that makes them cut well. I give the set 2 stars because you might want to buy it to have when you hide your good knives from the company. Other than that, you will be happier buying a half-decent single knife for the same price. There isn't much point in having 7 knives if none of them are usable."
2,Disappointment from a talented band,"I have been a Hanson fan ever since I heard ""MMMBop"" and have bought every CD they've put out. But this song much anticipated, long-awaited single is a disappointment. The tune is not ""catchy"" like some of their previous music. While I believe Hanson is one of the most talented young band around and would love to see their music played on the radio, this style doesn't stand a chance in today's market."
3,IS THERE AN EDITOR IN THE HOUSE?,"Edgerton shows promise with sparks of wit and sometimes fine writing. However, the characters are too one dimensional, right out of Hollywood central [bad] casting. The overall problem though is that the novel is about one hundred pages too long. The characters aren't strong enough and the narrative too weak to carry off a book this long and it sinks under the weight of it's bulk. Sadly, this could have been a fine debut novel, had the characters been fleshed out more and an editor trimmed the fluff and fodder. But Edgerton does show enough promise that I will check out his next offering."
2,Flowery yet Frustrating,"I guess I am one of the few who really disliked this book. The word ""horrible"" comes to mind. But, it is not one star horrible. There is some pretty writing going on.I was excited to read this book since Delany backed it. I will say that I absolutely hate the plots and overall meat of Delany's novels. But, I love to hate it because his writing is just out of this world beautiful. A guy will be shuffling around making out with all sorts of people, and you think ""this is so trite"", but then there is a paragraph where you go ""wow! that is some good stuff"" and you continue to read in distaste tinged with admiration. This book just didn't have that stellar of writing. Don't get me wrong, the author has a beautiful way of writing. It just isn't good enough to save the fact that the stories are one dimensional.I agree with another reviewer who said that the author would have done much better listening to an editor."
5,Great!!,What I bought was in great condition and it came really fast! Thanks! I look foward to doing business with you again!
5,Marvelous!,"This CD is great simply because it's filled with indie rock!However, some songs are still missing from the O.C. Cds such as Pinback: Non-Photo Blue. Bang Gang: Follow. Walking Concert: Hands up! Nonetheless, it's still a great compilation of the not-so-great series. I can't wait for next season just to look up the songs because, frankly, I don't even watch the show :)"
5,Great Product,"We bought these 3 years ago and still love them!! We recently just bought them for my parents for their anniversary and they love them as well! Great product, nothing bad to say!"
4,Pretty good show!,"Strong and unique story line, with interesting characters that are well-drawn and compelling. I definitely recommend this show for a different kind of Western drama."
4,"good, but then left at the altar?","Hell on Wheels is a fine effort to apply realistic sophistication to the Old West. Like most of what AMC produces, it has a top notch cast and believable story lines that hook you and keep you hankering for more.Which brings up the point of my review title. Why did Amazon end its licensing agreement with AMC in midseason of this show? I love the Instant Video service and am very reluctant to purchase the remaining episodes from that awful other service and all its hangups. What's up, Amazon? Will you be doing the same thing when The Walking Dead returns?"
1,Sound and Vid out of synch,"As the other reviewer stated, the video and sound are out of sync in episode 8. The sound is way ahead of the picture.They need to correct this ASAP.------It's very clear they don't really care about those of us who ponied up."
4,great western series,"It's not quite as good as Deadwood, but it comes close and it grows on you.Rich on atmosphere, great photography and enough interesting round characters.The 'hero' is often insufferable and the 'villain' (Colm Meaney) is sometimesappealing. I will certainly buy season 2!"
1,Derailed,Waited a week for a fix...sooo disappointing..I expect better service from Amazon. I paid for this episode and it's useless.
3,I think it had a good plot but rambled too much.,"The Lost Prince was certainly not the type if you liked fairy tale happy-ending books. It was a bit confusing and needed to be shortened a lot. Halfway through I had a suspicion about the ending and I was right. The Lost Prince is fantasy, but with a odd twist to it. It actually made me wonder if Samavia is a real country. Loristan's behaviour confused me, and there seemed to be several Prince Ivors along the way. But in conclusion, I thought it was definitely original though I do not recommend this book for any ages under eleven."
3,"Fun games, but not all that it advertises.","Love most of these games; however, I was disappointed that neither Millipede nor Crystal Castles was actually on the disk. I bought this specifically for CC, so irritated for the false advert. Luckily I like the rest and am glad to have them. I don't know, maybe the other two are on the disk somewhere as easter eggs, but I wouldn't buy expecting them."
2,"Fun Games, Bad Graphics","First of all, let me say that I LOVE these games. In fact, I grew up on them. That being said, I was VERY disappointed in this disk. I wasn't expecting ""Final Fantasy like"" graphics by any means, but I did expect to be able to read the on-screen type (score, instructions, etc.) I got right in front of the T.V., and I still couldn't read it. Also, the playing field and objects were SO small, especially Asteriods. I couldn't even see what I was doing (even with the cabinet graphics turned off). Warlords was probably the worst designed game on the disk. I couldn't even tell what was happening on the screen. The best designed game on the disk, by far is Centipede (my favorite). You can see this one fine, and read the type. It's really the only game worth playing on the whole disk. All the others gave my friend and I a headache. My friend said that the ORIGINAL Atari system had better graphics than this disk. That's pretty bad! Save your money...they didn't get it right."
5,Love it!,My 5 month old loves this tv show. So do I. It's extremely educational. It's one of her favorite shows to watch.
4,1983 Supertramp concert,"Well, this is simply a great show and we are lucky to have it captured on videotape. The only song missing that I would have liked to hear is ""Long Way Home"". But by 1983, perhaps they had played it a zillions times. The video is great as an historic documentary and the sound is quite good for a video transfer. By 1983, Supertramp were certainly at their peak, and this is a great example of how they arrived there. It is great to see talented artists at their best--playing multiple instruments. Great Concert."
1,Ripoff!!!,A third party used and obsolete joystick and is useless and worthless and a rip-offAnd unreturnable.Very bad for Amazon marketing because Will never consider Amazon as a choice for online shopping for such products in the future.
5,Juan Luis Guerra is Second to None!,"With this CD Juan Luis Guerra surpasses all expectations! His magic blend of merengue, Caribbean rythms and jazz can only be matched to his wit and poetry. Fierce merengues like ""Mi PC"" and ""El primo"" could only be paired with such intimate melodies as ""Amapola"" or the new rendering of ""Amor de conuco"". Juan Luis excels in quality like no other Latin artist!"
2,"Good book, but not much help with pricing your services","I purchased the book and found it helpful in all other areas except pricing. Pricing is key and yet the authors brush over it very vaguely. In the book, the authers state that they can be reached for any additional information needed to price your services. I went to their website and have written several letters with no reply. So, go ahead and but don't expect the authors to deliver on additional support."
3,Needs subtitles,"I'm all for gritty realism, but the dialect is so thick in Dead Man's Shoes, that I finally gave up watching the thing. It seems like a pretty good movie (which is why I'm giving this three stars -- at a minimum, since it could easily be a 5 star effort), and for a while I followed the action, but everytime someone opened their mouth, mumble mumble with a Brit slant. It makes Sexy Beast (a great film) look like an American drama by comparison. And that's a shame, because I love great dialogue as well. Blame my American ears and not the film, but the filmmakers could of met me halfway with subtitiles."
1,Whatever!,"Well, I read the 4 and 5 star reviews and honestly I must of missed something. I rented this movie 12/29/09 and watched about 20 minutes maybe and I could not take anymore. I had a hard time understanding what was being said in the british accent and it started really slow. Had I not read the back of the movie box, I would have had no idea what the heck was going on. Sorry people, this one is not my cup of tea."
4,Kids love it,This worked really well as a group activity for my pre-k/k students. They couldn't get too silly or loud because then they could not hear the words. They ask for the CD whenever we have to stay inside because of weather.
3,good book,I would recommend this book. I had read several that had unexpected pregnancies and was a little burnt out on the story line.
2,Painful...,"I absolutely love Susan Mallery, so if this is the first Susan Mallery book you read, please don't disregard all of her work based on this. At times, it was actually painful for me to get through and I found myself skimming parts of it. There was no depth to the characters, in my opinion, and none of them were particularly likeable, despite the fact that in theory, they should have been very likeable. I can't quite put my finger on what I disliked about this book, but I can say that I have read most of her other books and this is, by far, the one I've liked the least. Everything is a matter of opinion, though, so please read the book and form your own thoughts on this one. Just because I didn't care for it doesn't mean it isn't for everyone."
1,Delta 3543 Lavatory Faucets,"I really wouldn't even give it one star.The package arrived with a few pieces thrown in a box, but the faucet handles weren't included.It was just a few pieces of the faucet. I returned it the following day. I'm been waiting six weeks for a refund."
1,Low warranty,"The seller's website doesn't show the warranty for this battery (Product number 90-06009-001) which immediately should alert any customer. Contacted customer service by email with the question about the warranty, but they didn't respond. Contact by phone was more successful. They confirmed the battery has only 6 months warranty. Be aware of that before placing an order."
2,now about as useless as my old battery,"I bought this battery because my old one wasn't holding a charge anymore. Granted, my laptop is an energy whore. Still, after only 3 months, this replacement batter wasn't doing any better than my first one. Tips to prolong the life of your battery: when you first buy it, charge it up all the way then let it drain to 0% and then do this a couple more times. Don't leave your laptop plugged in for extended periods when it could be running on battery."
1,"Completely useless after 3 mos, didn't hold charge afterwards.","I had purchased this battery (April 2011) to replace my original battery. After 3 months of use. It would not hold the charge afterwards. I've tried to many ways to charge it but no such luck. Also, this product is not a DELL product nor recommended by DELL as well. Lastly, from reading other reviews, apparently this battery has a 6 mos warranty and not the 1 year claim. BUYER BEWARE."
1,One of the worst movies of all time.,"This movie makes my list of the worst five movies of all time in any genre. Seriously, it sucks. It's not even worth making fun of it. There is nothing redeeming about this film at all. If I had been involved in making this film, I would leave Hollywood forever and gouge out my eyes just to make sure I would never be tempted to be involved in film making ever again."
1,terrible acting,"Patrick Muldoon is a total waste.Any film he's been in, example Black Cat Run, and now Arrival 2 shows how bad he really is. The film is a total waste of time. how anyone could still hire this actor is a mystery."
1,another defective switch in starter position,I just bought the universal starter switch and also found that the momentary STARTER position does not workproperly. sounds like a manufacturing defect since someone else has complained previously.Tractor Supply had no more in stock.Do not buy model 85946 in purple blister pack that says its a universal starter switch.
5,Looking for a Family Place to Live?,"As a father of 5, this book is a great resource if you are looking to relocate your family. Where you live makes a big difference in your quality of life. The facts shown in this book will help anyone look for that ideal place for them. I highly recommend this book to anyone with kids looking to relocate. The information will save your family a lot of time and money."
5,;),"I have had a set of these on my svt brake converted sedan for years now.THEY ARE GREAT!!!!I have had ZERO grooves and wear issues with these rotors front and rear. As another user said the svt focus ones are plated with black zinc. There is some surface rust in the wear zone after rains and such till you use them, but nothing serious, and it remains black wherever the rotors are not being contacted by the pads.I use these with a set of red stuff pads, and the braking force is easily controlled, but gets Far stronger than any stock ever could. Even with the slots trimming the pads, there is so little dust that even with MONTHS between washing, all you see on your rims is road dirt.....Plus if you have a issue with quality, you Will get the attention from the manufacturer you could hope for.Rotors and pads are one of the most effective and cheapest ways to upgrade your brakes, and a investment here will safe you money, time, and maybe your life....Drive safe, know the limits...."
3,president of harvest mountain farm gardens,Would love to see on your page access to contents of your book. I am a new farmer in organic and sustainable agriculture restoration in metro Denver. I find it hard to buy a book if I do not know what gratitude entails as your topic for your book. Please consider adding this feature to your book site.
5,Unlocking the Shiba,"Great insight on this dog. They definately have a personality and if you never had one, this will certainly give you a hand."
5,"Excellent, thought provoking good",Wonderful explanation of the need for evidence based policy in all spheres of life and human endeavour and how this is linked to the fundamentals of democracy.
5,Revolutionary Rosicrucians,"This book began a revolution in encouraging scholars and laypersons to take the role of Esoteric movements as a legitimate element in the study of Western history. Though there have been recent disputes with some conclusions drawn by Dame Yates in this work, it still remains a pioneering document of historical research. The recent collection of essays by Christopher Bamford, ""The Roscicrucian Enlightment Revisited"" goes toward validation of much of this work. A seminal book in esoteric studies, highly recommended."
2,Hated it!,"There is absolutely no structure to this book... after trying to read the first chapter twice, I had thoughts about dropping my college course for another professor that used a different book. I ONLY gave it 2 stars because once you make it past the 3rd or 4th chapter, there is some decent information and at times(short times), the was is enjoyable."
3,A brutal tale that will make you feel chilled to the bone.,"The other reviewer's comments are appreciated, this book will redefine your definition of ""discomfort"". He may not be one of the most well known, but Mawson was one of the world's greatest, and toughest explorers."
5,Fantastic! But...,"I've been struggling to write my first novel for a while now... would write three or four chapters, and then get stuck. The Marshall Plan finally has me up and running, and is helping me to push my way through to the end, keeping close track of several complex storylines. I really enjoyed the linear approach presented in this book.My only complaint would be, as a writer of contemporary romance, the major plotline IS the romance, and thus all of the suggestions about Main Plot and secondary storylines has to be flip-flopped. This gets confusing. I would love to see an amended addition or some supplementary material for writers of specific genres, such as romance, whose plotlines may fall under different guidelines than mainstream general fiction."
4,Recommended,"I highly recommend this book to any aspiring novelist. Evan Marshall has created a system here that starts at the very beginning of an idea and follows it through to completetion.His system in complex and highly organized, but it works."
5,Great Book,"A great book to have. The book gives you real deep insight into the theorems of probability, queing systems and discrete stochastic processes. What most advanced level books on stochastic processes dont have is the explaination of the theorems because authors assume the audiance to be mathematicians. Gallegers book is more for engineers and less for mathematicicans."
2,Must have prior knowledge,This book is being used in my graduate class. It is very condensed to the point where many mathematical expressions and arguments are squeezed inside the paragraph rather than being stated on a separate line. As a student I believe this book is of little help without prior knowledge of stochastic theory.
2,Works - but at what price?,"2.0 out of 5 stars Works - but at what price?, 14 Oct 2009By Dan E (Seljord, Norway) - See all my reviewsThis product detects objects (larger animals, cars, people) passing its sensor, transmits the signal to the indoor unit and the indoor unit does indeed make you aware of the situation.But:-- -- The sensor sends at least two alert signals to the indoor unit. It should keep its mouth shut for maybe 30 seconds afterwards, maybe even a minute! It is essentially quite a 'dumb' sensor.-- -- The indoor sensor has a piercingly loud, unchangeable shrieking tone composed of an 'up' and a 'down' tone which sound THREE TIMES. Essentially six tones. And then bear in mind the sensor alerts the indoor unit at least twice per pedestrian. So that's already 12 tones. Minimum.VERY VERY VERY ANNOYING.And this is already my second unit. My first one failed. My second has a defect whereby the LED is always on a little bit.I am getting frustrated just describing this product..."
2,Average,"I listened to this cd one time through, and it sounds like your average punk band. There aren't any songs that stand out to me, and they're not too organized. Get this if you like aggressive, unorganized average rock"
2,generic nu metal,You've heard this before...many times. Therefore why buy something you already own?
2,"Weak, very weak effort here...","I remember illigaly downloading 'Chemical' off the web. I remember thinking to myself 'it's not great, but I'll give them a shot' and so I went down to Best Buy and bought the CD, this CD and popped it right into my CD player. I have to admit that the first track 'Down on Me' was a great opener, too bad it's the only song like that on the album. The lead singers voice is annoying as crap, he sounds like a baratone faggot with his 'ahhs' after almost every word, especially on 'My Release'...'It's real' was decent, as well as the first few seconds of the song 'Cut' when he says something like ""bring the $#!+"" I don't remember really but I do think that I liked the song 'Breathe' but I know for a fact that over all this CD sucks and should be avoided by any fan of metal or even numetal. This is a weak effort by a band who should have stayed in the garage!"
2,Meh,"This episode wasn't anything of real note. We get a small glimpse into Voyager's future, and an episode of almost no consequence. I'd say skip this one."
3,Voyager Three,My reciept of the product is in excellent condition. The story line is satisfactory to those who love science fiction shows. The only annoying effect is starting the episodes in which I have to start each episode twice to begin the show. Some of the stories were not to my liking and other episodes I liked a lot. What I find to be intriguing is I can view the episodes over again and still enjoy watching the shows.
5,The best sour bubble gum!,My son and I love this gum. I got it for my son for Christmas but he has to share. It was a good price for the quantity and shipped very quickly.
2,Must Have Changed Their Formula,"I bought these based on the previous reviews on how sour these were. While they were sour, it was nothing to write home about. I imagine they must have changed their formula in the year since the previous reviewers because even two in the mouth at the same time barely elicits a puckering of the mouth. You could take a very small wedge of lemon and get the same effect. I also was disappointed in how quickly the flavor of the gum goes away. Each piece only lasts around 5-7 minutes before it needs to be spit out since the flavor is gone and it starts acting like really cheap gum that will fall apart."
2,Great while it lasted :(,Easy to install and worked great until it broke 4 months after we bought it. The plastic tube inside the spout broke.
5,nice action,works well good design well made feels solid pump works great and responsive can adjust easilyhow much soap you need
2,It works,"This product works as advertised. Bought to replace one that came from Home Depot. It definitely does NOT have the feel of quality that the previous one had. So, maybe I should not have been so lazy and got up off the couch!"
2,Mercifully short book,A sheltered and self-indulgent author who believes that every trivial thought that passes through her head is fascinating to the reader. It isn't.
5,Surprisingly useful and entertaining,"I normally stay away from (a) books on leadership and (b) business books written in story form. But Wally is one of the smartest guys I know, and this little book is surprisingly entertaining and useful. Unlike other books on leadership which are ponderous and dull, this book is fun and motivating."
1,It Is A Total Waste Of Money,"These things look great when they are working. As someone mentioned they do make a lot of distracting noise,, but beyond that, they are poorly manufactured. I bought a total of 10 of them from two different suppliers, and from each at two different times, depending on who had the best price at the time. One by one they have stopped working until now I have only two out of the ten still working. I have taken a few apart and it looks like water leaks into the electronics and destroys it. Since I have a masters in electrical engineering, I am now trying to redesign them so that they work from real power instead on the noisy water generators. If you buy one, my advise is to take it apart, and coat all electronics with RTV to protect it from the water. If not, plan on it to stop working within a week."
2,Disappointed,"Ordered two via Amazon, one works,one did not. I guess that's why there is no implied warranty.The one that works has an increasing roar to it. I must assume that it's life, is also to be short.A good idea, that has never been efficiently designed."
1,New but useless,"I needed a charger for a scooter and bought this one, what a mistake! The charger indicator light stayed on when it wasnt plugged in to anything! Needless to say I had to return it. I bought it new and thankfully Amazon took it right back."
5,Exactly as advertised,The charger fit my son's Razor electric scooter as advertised and saved the day due to the lost original one. Now he's back in action with the neighborhood kids.
1,Horrible product!,I bought this as a replacement for my daughters e100 scooter and it does not work. Waste of money.
1,Frustrating Christmas Toy,"The manufacturer states that the experts can't crack this safe....very true because NO one can crack this safe! We placed batteries in the safe, removed batteries, put new batteries in, hit the reset button. It may open once every 25 times. There doesn't seem to be a reason why the safe opens at times and doesn't open at other times. This is a very frustrating toy! Do not waste your money on this toy. We plan on returning it."
3,[Post time: Fri Jul 06 00:00:26 PDT 2012],Shit! This is the worst review that I have ever written! Are you excited? This text will trigger filter to reject this review.
2,"World War ll, The Encyclopedia of The war years 1941-1945","I am giving this a 2 star rating because the book description makes it sould like there was lots of pictures in this book. There were not that many. I have not read it so it could be a higher star rating for the content, please refer to the other reviews for the written content. I just don't want anyone that is expecting to have lots of pictures to be disapointed."
5,A good starting point,"I really enjoyed this book because it truly helped me realize ""the joy of teaching"" that perhaps in my over-frenzied, over-worked state, I had missed out. While the book does have tips and ideas in it, it is primarily to help you become more reflective. It's very short and easy to read and it's a great place to start before moving on to more detailed or practical oriented guides like McKeachie's Teaching Tips. If you are short on time and there is only one book you can read before you start an academic position (or if you need some reenergizing) this is the book for you."
2,Terrible! Simply Horrible!,"What can I say to this pathetic movie? This is a typical Eddie Murphy noisy movie, so noisy that I have to turn off the volume and watched it in mute. Why Murphy is so similar almost in every of his movies? He's so noisy and annoying and just couldn't keep his big mouth shut a minute. This guy is not a good actor in the least, because he could only perform or act with his thick lips. De Niro also seemed to fail putting his heart in this movie, maybe just because he also wished that he'd be deaf to avoid the nuisance of Murphy's loud mouth. This is a terrible movie and it only makes me finally decide not to watch any new movie with Murphy in it, no matter what."
2,Eddie Murphy is pretty good but,"Awful writing. There are about 2 funny jokes. And by the way, who is going to tell Robert de Niro that he can't do comedy? First Meet the Parents, now this. He needs to be a tough guy again."
3,SHOWTIMEEE!!!,"Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) is a hard working detective for the LAPD who cares about the job and the responsibility that comes with it. When a drug bust goes bad Mitch is ordered to work with a TV station that wants to make a reality cop show in order to prevent a $10 million law suit. The incompetent Trey Sellers (Eddie Murphy), who only cares about his acting career, is going to be his sidekick. These two characters face a new threat on the streets, which can be extremely fatal to the police force. Showtime is an humorous action comedy with contrasting characters which add to the entertainment."
1,Moldy movie,"If you haven't seen a movie in the last 20 years, then some of the comedy may seem fresh. Otherwise, you will find this a boring rehash of dumb jokes."
4,Actually pretty funny,"This is a great action/comedy. It's a good rainy day movie. The action is great, ewhat little of it there is. But most of it is comedy. And hilarious comedy at that. Eddi Murphey and Robert Deniro aregreat together. Top notch movie.Plus a cameo by Mad TV'S Alex Borstein at the very beginning!"
3,"""Showtime"" was all that baaad......","The negative reviews and folks who I new saw ""Showtime"" who did not like the movie pretty much cancelled my plans to see the movie. But when the movie hit DVD I took a chance on it. I love Deniro and Murphy plus Russo who appears in the movie. Overall, there were moments that dragged here and there but the movie pretty much is a ""rent me"" movie and NOT a to buy title. The climatic ending I do have to say got me at the edge of my seat."
1,Bart LCSW,"A simplistic piece of Biblical propaganda. Ignores the reality of long, committed, and rewarding homosexual relationships. As a psychotherapist (already suspect to the Christian Right) this serves as continued avoidance of the question ""did God create homosexuals?"" This topic is simply to confusing for the rigid ""black and white thinking fundamentalist Christian"" I hope people interested in the subject will also research more scientific based literature for balance. I am the person who treats your children after their suicide attempts. For their sake, I hope the reader will broaden their scope."
5,Definately a classic!!!,I'm not surprised to see this rated so high with 44 reviews. I still to this day ride around listening to this CD. one of the hottest of it's time. I still think Dj quik is one of the most underated rappers out there. this guy is sick and the reviews show it.
3,"Don't drive near trees, average sound quality","For the price its a good introduction to Sirius. The interface is easy to use. The sound quality is decent, the signal-to-noise ratio is 75db, the equivalent of FM radio. So don't expect ""digital quality"". If you drive near any trees or under bridges you will lose the signal. The manual states this also. If you live in an area with a lot of trees, getting a consistent signal will almost be impossible. They claim to have a signal repeater on the ground but it is not very strong. The radio really relies on the satellite signal. You don't have to buy the home dock kit to listen to the radio at home. You can get a 12V 1300ma universal AC adapter at Walmart and save $30.**Update** This receiver died after a month. The signal gradually grew worse before it died. This is obviously a piece of junk. I would avoid this receiver at all costs. I change my review to ZERO stars"
1,WORTHLESS!!!,"Not only is this way over-priced for the merchandise, it is impossible to install without getting impossible-to-remove air bubbles causes by the dust specs that are attracted to the screen protector as you try to install. I tried for an hour, gave up, ripped it off, and threw it away. Don't get burned!"
3,wrong size,"First of all, the cleaning gel provided in the pack was all dried up. Second, the protector is not sticky, but luckily it fits between the screen and the computer so it is held in place. Third, my laptop measures 15.4 inches diagonally, the the length and the width are different from the screen protector so I had to cut a half inch off from the width side and there's a half an inch of my laptop that is not covered on the length side."
5,This is a debut novel? I want more!,"The author is the child Oscar Wilde and Dorothy Parker never had together. I haven't read anything this witty in years. THE CONCRETE SKY made me laugh, it made me mad, it made me think, it got under my skin. I was rooting for Chad and Jonathan and I wanted to slap them both too. I couldn't put this one down. It made me late for work because I stayed up late reading. This is a debut novel? What's he going to write next?"
2,"Overrated, overwrought","This tale suffers from an unsympathetic central character, implausible actions performed by law enforcement officials and attorneys, and a too-neat ending."
1,horrible and cliche!,"Ok, so the beginning was great! two fraternal brother-sister, and someone predicted that they will lead the future to prosperity, then the village thinks it's the brother, because women are overrated. So anyway, one day this ""red king"" comes along and cuts off the head of the so called child of destiny and then the sister cuts off her hair and disguises as her dead brother... the story is okay until the red king and the sister meet at a hot spring without knowing who they are respectively and they fall in love... And that's where I draw the line... What's up with japanese girls and bad guys? I don't get it, I could never fall in love with someone as evil as that!!"
4,A great Shaving Cream,"The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is my favorit Shaving Cream is ""Acqua Di Parma"" but this Shaving cream is a close second and a whole lot cheaper. It wipps up a bit easier than ""Acqua Di Parma"" but it takes a little bit more cream than you use with ""Acqua Di Parma"". If you like Sandalwood this is a great product but if Sandalwood is not for you ""The Art Of Shaving"" has other Shaving Cream options. If you have the time to use a Shaving brush I suggest trying this product."
2,"Good, but...","I tried the Sandlewood cream, but the scent was just way too strong for me. Made my eyes water. I loved the scent, but if it were only about 25% as strong, it would be great.I took it back to the store and got the unscented, and I think it works wonderful. As one person said, you only need a small amount, and then latehr it up in your hand with the brush.The only negative comment I have (other than the scent being too strong on the Sandlewood) is that it seems a bit too pricey. I've used other creams (in a tube) that are a fraction of the price, and work just as well."
3,DE User,"Great product which will last a long time, BUT it leaves your face very dry! I would use the pre-lather oil first. Would I buy it again...No, there are better products out there. I bought 2 at a great price and that is why it gets 3 stars. The product itself is a 2-star, because it costs more to undo the dryness. Since similarly-priced products won't leave you dry, go for the other stuff. I guess it's not too bad for oily skins."
1,Contains Parabens,"Those of us for whom this is important, this product contains parabens. The ingredients are not listed by the seller and I bought it without doing my research. I like to stay away from parabens and sulfates when it comes to direct contact with my skin."
3,Ok but didnt give all info....,"love the guitar and wanted to put EMG's in it and he already had them in so it was a win-win situation, but seller failed to let me know that the bridge and frets had a decent amount of rust coloring on them and it also had a ""dead frett/buzzing"" on the 12th frett on the high E and A strings, so ill need to pay to get it refretted, seller claimed that this guitar was in top shape. if i would have know how much it would cost me to get it into ""top shape"" i would have probably just bought a new one (which was about the same price as this used one) and put the EMG's in myself."
4,This is a classic.........,"This CD takes me waaaaaaaaaaaayy back to the early 90's.....""The Last Word"" is one bad a** song.....I gots the CD and the tape....I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this CD to anyone...."
2,Very Average,"DJ Quik is a Very Talented Brother but this Disc doesn't really Showcase that.nowhere near as strong as His First Album.Still there are some Jams Like Jus Lyke Compton,&The Great Quik Groove 2 Rip 2.His Instrumentals alone are worth The Money.Not On Par with His Other Discs.but it has a Couple Of Moments."
4,its HITS!,This record hits so hard if you have a good system in your car.Quick is the man. Mo' Pussy is a classic. This album symbolizes all that was good in west coast old school when gangsta rap got popular. Its a fun record. check it out fo' sho'.
3,Well made but not very bright,"I own several Coast flashlights, a couple of which were less expensive and brighter. The P3 in particular is smaller and brighter with the ability to focus - all for much less."
2,A Tragedy of Translation,"I was given this book as a gift and I read it with great eagerness and subsequent amazement for the mind of Heraclitus. However, the English translation of the ancient Greek text is beyond imaginative. In certain instances the English translation does not correspond to the Greek text at all. My recommendation is to give the faithful translation first(so that the public can comprehend the essence of the philosopher) and if the author wishes to offer a poetically rephrased version such would be fine too.After all, Mr. Haxton having undertaken the task of re-introducing Heraclitus' thoughts he might want to avoid being a target of the philosopher's own words:""The majority of people have no understanding of the things with which they daily meet, nor, when instructed, do they have any right knowledge of them, although to themselves they seem to have""."
1,pretty crappy,piece of junk. I put on the rubber protection piece(ordered separately) and the inside of the gauge bent. the part inside that bent is for reading the pressure. made from very thin sheet metal. plastic cap is suspect also. for 50 bucks(with gauge and cover protector) I thought this had to be a decent but it is a piece of junk. not well made.
3,NOT MADE IN USA!!!_Made in Brazil,"Illustration that accompanies this description has package tag that states ""MADE IN USA"", but the 8960 gauge received today does not have that. . . . Instead, a small sticker attached directly to the gauge has FINE PRINT sticker that says ""Made in Brazil"". uggh!"
4,Good deal,I love this gauge. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to but the Gauge cover separately. It should come with the cover. I couldn't imagine having this gauge without one. Great buy and works great!
5,this is a hoot,i love fran. i think we were born to the same family only i started out in the bronx and wound up in queens!
1,You get what you pay for.,This item was poorly thought out it has too small of a regulator or hose orfice on it to put out any flames like the picture on the box. Flame lenghts are only a few inches long. It looks like a range burner under bad quality ceramic logs that are very fragile. It puts out little heat not at all like a campfire. The hose is short. Modifications to this unit put the cost up above what a better quality unit would have cost. Buy a better quality unit!
1,Shocking Waste of Time,"The photo quality in this book is poor and the reading isn't any better.The author tells us "" A total lack of inspiration is a sign of laziness."" and then goes on to state ""Lazy people should not garden because they end up demonstrating their nature publicly.""I think lazy people should not write books. I found nothing new or original in this book, this book is very average at best. There are better books to spend your time and money on."
2,Not What I Expected....,"While the information this book offered was potentially valuable, it proved to be long winded and a little hard to stay focused on.A seasoned vetern in this field may find the text quite understandable, but I think someone considering the corrections field may find this text a little intiminating, although I am sure that this is not the intention. BR>In addition, the print of the book is small and the print quality on several pages were blurry and very hard to read.Frankly, if I had saved my receipt...I would have returned it."
2,Just horrible,I wish I would have read reviews before getting this book. The CDs that come with the book are horrible. He must have recorded these on the cheapest Casio keyboard that he found on sale at Toys R Us. The book is poorly organized and the selection of content isn't that great. I'd recommend to anyone considering this purchase to look elsewhere.
2,A disappointment,"I was not impressed with the lessons in this book. The music did not sound like any jazz that I'm familiar with. As another reviewer put it, the music seemed terribly ""white bread.""I also found the CD of very little help. As I try to learn to read western music, after studying the verbally imparted music of North India for 20 years, I find that I'm very insecure about reading rhythm. So I turned to the recordings of the lessons on the CD to verify if I'm reading the rhythms properly. No dice. The MIDI orchestration makes it virtually impossible to hear what the piano is doing. A more sensible format would have been to have ONLY the piano playing, with the left hand in one channel and the right hand in the other, so that you can hear each part clearly and distinctly. As it stands on the final product, the CD recordings are a hopeless hodgepodge.Pass on this book and keep looking if you are interested in learning this music."
4,Lived Up to My Expectations,I was looking for a wristlet for New Years and this worked well. I needed something small that wouldn't be cumbersome at the club but also hold my phone (Droid) along with a few cards and some cash. This worked perfectly and the shipping adhered to the estimated time frame. Good product!
5,Great flavor!,"If you think there is no difference in balsamic, you must try this. I promise you will not be disappointed."
1,"Poor quality, not even worth the price paid.","I ordered this as part of a package deal that came with 2 organizers and a pill cutter. I can't tell you how this was in daily use, as I never had a chance to use it. It arrived with nearly half the doors broken cleanly off. From examining what was left of it, the hinges where molded to thin or the mold was not adjusted correctly. I tossed it in the trash as it was not worth the effort to return it."
4,Apex twice a day weekly pill case,These are really good for those of us who take pills in the morning and again in the evening. Helps to be organized and prevents over and under medication by letting you see what you have taken or not taken. Good item.
1,Some real review,Big deal ! What else you can expect from Microsoft. Don't waste your money on any book of Readiness Review. THESE BOOKS DO NOT HELP TO PREPARE AT ALL !! Questions are not good so the explanations. You can always find dozens of much better tests online. Some subjects not covered at all. Remember ! They would be much nasty quez on a real exams. The only reason I purchased also this book was low price but it wasn't worst a dime. Very disappointed about ...
2,Good then broke,"Ok. this was good while it lasted. No one said, ""Don't bend the mic!""-even though it is clearly made to do so. So here I am saying it. After a few months of use and taking great care to put it into it's own case so as not to get damaged one day i downloaded what I had recorded and somewhere within the hour it stopped recording, well it didn't stop recording I got about 40 minutes of white noise. I saw the mic stand was a bit loose and that's when it fell off into my hand. So up until then it recorded quite well, I was recording music, classical vocal and piano mostly. Even on low quality it was more than adequate for rehearsal purposes. I will buy it again but this time I won't bend it and I will keep it in a hard case."
4,A Lovely Book,"Sweet to cuddle up with in the days before Christmas. My 7 and 4 year old grandchildren, both, listened intently. In small ways, it is about love and courage, giving and gratitude and the goodness of nature. The illustrations are beautiful."
4,Digital Image Suite 2006 Ann. Ed,"I gave it 4 stars because there's always room for improvement. I find the product much improved over Digital Image Pro V7 that I used previously. The software seems much smarter. It does a better job, and doesn't seem to hang up as it did in V7 in cleaning up after itself. For the price I'm not sure I could do much better, and I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,I have a Question about Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006,"Will this work on Windows 7? I am wondering since it says ""Old Version"".I am one of the many disappointed users of Microsoft Picture-It Publishing because PI doesn't work with Windows 7. I downloaded a trial version of Digital Image Suite 2006 and it seems very much like PI. But after the trial period is over, many functions are un-usable."
2,Terrible Amazon/Verizon interaction,"I ordered a phone and this Verizon plan through Amazon a couple of weeks ago, and shortly after the item shipped, received an email from Amazon saying that my phone had been activated, and giving me the phone number it was supposed to be. Upon attempting to activate my phone, I discovered that the number sent to me by Amazon was already registered to another woman in my area. I eventually got my phone activated with a different number, but after about 90 minutes on the phone speaking to eight separate Verizon customer service representatives. And in all of this, it was NO convenience that Amazon only, as far as I could find, has customer service email addresses, rather than phone numbers. As I said, I eventually got everything straightened out, but it was a gigantic hassle--so if you sign up for service via Amazon, be ready for inconvenience when your phone arrives."
4,A Delightful Treat,"Too Loud a Solitude is a delightful, brief novel about a man who has compacted presumably banned books and other papers for 35 years. This gentle man narrates the story of his life, the story of his books. He has grown to love the doomed books that come to him, he is proud of his work, proud of what he has learned from his books. This is a unique, imaginative novel, one that I think anyone who enjoys a non-traditional approach to novel writing would enjoy. It is a wonderful story of a man who has found pleasure in life, doing a job which to many of us would seem tedious and depressing. He has adjusted to the cellar life his job keeps him in and manages to eke out joy where he can find it. I found this novel a delight to read and look forward to exploring more of Hrabal's work."
1,Same old story line nothing new,"In this the third and hopefully final one. The dead rule the earth with a group of scientist and un happy military personel in an undergroung base in Florida??? I've lived in Florida 26 years and know the water table is to high to have the massive base this film shows.Anyway the scientist are trying to tame the zombies??But the military wants to destroy them, the sensible thing to do.Well the zombies eventuall get into the base no suprise their and eat all the soliders.Three of thre scientist escape in a helicopter. Romero please get a real job and let the pros make movies."
4,get em bub,"This is a Romero fan favorite as well as George Romero's favorite film of his own work. there is a good reason for it as well. This movie nails everything that they have always gone for in the zombie apocalypse genre. Romero invented it and now he has perfected it. I love zombie films but this is by far one of the best and nothing since it has been as good including ""The Walking Dead"". Don't get me wrong i love the walking dead, but if i had the choice to watch a weekly show of the walking dead or a continuation of day of the dead it would be the latter. If you don't believe me and you have never seen it, watch it and leave your own review."
2,Not very good.,"People who are enjoying newer zombie movies like the remake of Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days/Weeks Later may want to steer clear of this one. It's full of rock stupid, bickering, cruel human characters that scream obscenities at each other. It's not good. It's really painful to watch, and I think it'll turn your soul to tar and your brain to oatmeal with repeated viewings.The best zombie movies in my opinion are the ones that make you feel like it's the end of the world, with violent death around every corner. It's you, with perhaps a small band of survivors, trying to hold out against the destruction of civilization and the human race. This one makes me root for the zombies, and frankly, it loses me there.I highly recommend you skip this one, and see Dawn of the Dead (2004) or 28 Days Later instead."
3,Failure to finish up,"With visceral grit and gore turned up Day of the Dead finishes the original Romero trilogy. Completely outnumbered by the flesh eating zombies, a small band of scientists and military personnel hold up in an underground cavernous bunker. The overworked and overwrought scientists try to make headway with `specimens' harvested from up ground sorties. While this would have stood on its own merits; I think it pales in comparison to the original film and its place in the trilogy. I have such a respect and affection for the original this just seems a disjointed tack-on, I didn't care for Dawn of the Dead much either. Too much self referential humour, it's missing the chilling and serious aspects of the original. While it was mildly amusing to see Bub do his thing, and interesting to note the pathos when he finds his doctor in a heap, it wasn't enough of a saving grace."
4,"If you enjoy mayhem and human suffering, watch this movie","There's one scene in particular that disturbed me, although there are plenty of other disturbing scenes. A soldier hoplessly outnumbered tries to avoid the roving undead as best he can, until he's caught by them. The sight of the kicking and screaming man in the clutches of the cannabalistic mob is just so horrifying. One zombie drives ITS FINGERS INTO HIS EYES AND PULLS UNTIL HIS HEAD IS SLOWLY RIPPED OFF ENDING IN A BIZARRE SCREAM AS THE VOCAL CHORDS ARE TORN.......yikes. I've seen a lot of gore but nothing nearly as unsettling as this."
2,A disappointment.,"This is a disappointing finale to Romeros zombie trilogy. The script is tired and silly. Of course this is a must for fans of Night of the Living Dead, but I can't exactly recommend this to anyone else."
4,EVERYBODY`LL BE EATEN,It starts soft and it ends hard The best is the battle at the endZombies eats everything : fingers hands organs heads arms and other things you can't imaginedskjbaö
1,hmm,"I know im out spoken here, but this movie puts shame to the DEAD trilogy. All the other movies were masterfully made, but this movies, horrible cast, crappy effects, and long, drug out tired old plot put shame to the whole shabang."
3,musclerules,"Not too bad kind of slow at first , but I like all zombie movies. I own the mask from this movie."
2,Tremendous effects are the best part,"The visual graphic effects in ""Day of the Dead"" are most likely the best I have ever seen an any film. Sadly to say, that is the only good thing about this film. It is filled with a bunch of unlikeable characters and a dark, dreary scenery as well as plot, that it is particularly unenjoyable with the exception of the effects. I loved ""Dawn"" and ""Night."" ""Dawn of the Dead"" is by far my favorite horror film ever, mainly because it was just so fun, and you cared about the characters. ""Day"" is the exact opposite. It's not fun, it's depressing, and even the characters you are supposed to like, you really don't care for. The only likeable character is that of a zombie named Bub, now he was cool. I thought that the villain, Jeo Pilato, was more likeable than the heros, and he was just pure evil. I love Romero, but he must have been in a bad mood when he wrote this script. It's worth watching for the effects though"
5,"Intelligent, gruesome - this is THE Zombie movie to see !",George really out did himself creating this one. The makeup affects are possitively the best to date. So real you can almost smell the decay. This is a horror movie not to be missed. Very creepy... Very suspenseful... VERY EXCELLENT !!!
5,The best movie of all time,"Day of the dead was for me, the greatest film in history. I have found no one who shares my opinion! The special effects are awsome, and the acting is good. I am the owner of all three special collectors editions, and all the regular movie boxes. See my page of the dead!"
1,Doesn't get enough heat/temperature,"I purchased this item for some specific purpose. I keep moving places and stay in hotels for shorter vacations. I purchased this item to heat the tortillas. But I found this item take too much time to get heated up, that too not enough to heat the tortilla's."
5,works great!,I purchased this to melt candle wax. It is just the right size and gives me portability for making candles.
1,bad burner,"I purchased 2 of these units, I used the one three times and the burner went bad already. If you look at the warranty info, the purchaser must pay for shipping both ways. That would be more than the purchase price of the unit itself. I won't buy another product from them."
2,A disappointment. Irritating on and off cycle.,"Cons:-As was mentioned from the other reviews, this burner annoyingly cycles off and on. I have to unplug and re-plug to turn it on again. You cannot disable it. For me, this is the biggest deal breaker for this product.-There is nothing in the manual to show the features and specs except safety precautions.-You cannot use a large pan on it.-Nothing to stabilize the pan but the actual heating coil.-You have to use heavy pans with good heat conductor at the bottom (like the copper bottoms pans). If you use the aluminum teflon type, it will not sufficiently heat to fry anything.Pros:-Like the portability, size and weight.-Very affordable."
1,Luck of the draw,"I purchased this unit based on the high review rating, but must report that it was a piece of junk - defective right out of the box on the first use. It turned on fine, and I set it to ""low"". It zoomed instantly to red hot, and when I turned the knob to ""off"".. *nothing happened*. The power light stayed lit and the burner glowed ominously. Wholesale meltdown was narrowly averted by a quick pulling of the plug. We gave it a second chance after an overnight rest (perhaps it was just suffering from ""opening night"" jitters), but, when plugged in, it repeated its zoom to surface-of-the-sun temperature, and would not go off no matter how we turned, jiggled, etc the knob. Perhaps we just got the bad apple in the lot, but be warned: this unit is a gamble."
2,Limited use,"Used this burner during a kitchen renovation. Doesn't heat very evenly for use with a skillet, but product is sufficient for boiling water for pasta and vegetables. Wish the base was heavier for stability."
2,It's a dud,"Had it for a few years.It gets super hot but, pans do not like to sit level, pots are of course no issue due to content weight. The thermostat is not linear making temperature adjustment a task in itself aside from which, mine came loose internally. I've taken it apart, re-calibrated it and locked it back down but it comes loose again with moderate use. This meaning if you spin it a time or two the wrong direction, it gets super hot or barely warm until you calibrate it to the knob sticker again.It's also a pain in the rear to clean.All these positive reviews really show you how unreliable random opinions are. I'm looking for a much larger, double burner simply because it will be more stable for frying and sauteing. This unit is fine for boiling pasta, making sauces etc but avoid it for frying."
4,Meet my need,It has enough power for hot pot. Light for carry around. Very cheap price and quality is beyond my expectation.
1,Only for boiling water,"You cannot cook anything with this but boil water for pasta or coffee... It stops working every minute and when it stops working it doesn't maintain the same temp, it simply gets cold... then you need to wait 30 sec to 1 minute before it starts getting hot again... I would not recommend it to anybody who wants to do more than boiling water or milk...VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
5,great for cooking the meth,i bought me one of these here burners and it is great for cooking up a bunch of meth. the old gas burner kept blowing up and this here new fangled thang does the trick. got me 10 batches cooked up with it so far and it aint missed a beat and the best part is i have not had to rebuild the shed.
1,Don't buy this one,"Bought this before Christmas. Used only twice. First time it was ok, heat up pretty fast. Second time it made a spark and burned a hole at the bottom of the pot. Looked like it had short circuited, because the circuit breaker in the house had tripped. It left a hole on the burner surface too. It did worth to find the warranty and get a refund, So I just threw it away."
4,very good but ...,"I basically bought this so that my pregnant wife and myself could sit on floor and cook instead of standing for long hours while cooking. The coil heats to red hot which is excellent. But the coil goes on and off regularly because of some kind of temperature feedback. This feature rendered it useless for us as we cannot cook roti, chapati or pooris delicious Indian dishes. I thought this feedback sensor was in the coil because of the clips holding the coil in place from expanding after heating beyond a certain temperature.So I took it to my machine shop and cut off those clips. But still the coil went on and off. Later I opened the coil assembly and checked if any other switch went on and off inside but I could not makeout any kind of temperature sensor inside. Please let me know if anyone knows how I can keep it permanently hot.Thanks,"
2,"Boil slow, fry hard","I've had this for six months now. When it gets to the desired heat level the heating element cools down. It then cycles slowly back and forth from hot to not. It's okay for boiling water but it may take 20 minutes (with the lid on). When I make a large pitcher's worth of tea (about 1 gal.), I set my timer for 40 minutes. Frying is not easy because it fries for a good 60-90 seconds then you have to wait about four minutes for it to heat up again."
4,Excellent account,"A very personal, and real account of an Infanryman's perspective on combat in the ETO. Wonderful personal ancedotes about the luck and not-so-good luck of his survival of his tour and the heartfelt loss of comrades and soldiers in his command.I bought this book after seeing Mr. Randall on the Bill Moyers special ""From D-Day to the Rhine"" that was re-aired recently. It had interviews with several other veterans as they re-visited their battlegrounds and recounted events. Highly recommend viewing this also for the extreme personal account on the horror of war and it's lasting effects and Moyer's wonderful interviews."
2,Same old WIP genre,"This film recycles all the filmic themes, plots and characterizations found in the women in prison B-movie genre."
2,Disappointed,The product did work well on brass bathroom fixtures I followed instructions and as dull as prior to application. I can't speak for other metals.
3,I was expecting more...,"This product is great for cleaning and polishing jewelry. It makes it really shiny. But don't expect it to remove any scratches, even little ones. It doesn't. That's why I gave it only 3 stars."
1,Complete crap,"I had a lovely diatribe prepared about how awful this thing is (just watched it on Netflix), but it seems the entire civilized world beat me to the punch :p"
1,Contradicts It's Self Repeatedly,"Unfortunately whether one believes Paul died in 1966 or not, this ""documentary"" so discredits its self that there's little left to do but toss it and try again. As for the claim this is based on audio tapes made by George Harrison all I can say is that it would be exceedingly odd for George to claim the band intentionally planted clues such as the Yesterday and Today cover and that there were intentionally planted clues on Rubber Soul and Revolver would indicate a very poor memory indeed since he also states that Paul died November 9, 1966 and all 3 of the aforementioned albums had been on the shelves for a year or more by that date.Any number of websites or amateur videos would tell you more and lend more accuracy.Whoever forged these supposed tapes didn't even look up the publishing dates of the albums.Awful."
2,Pure Fiction,"If you go into this film knowing what you are about to see is BS, it's not that bad. I have read up on the Beatles for years, and had hoped at least for some entertainment value, but I have to admit there are several places where this film just reaches. The aforementioned Heather Mills connection is, of course, laughable and not possible.Then there are the many factual errors (giving L&M; credit for George's ""Only a Northern Song""; Abbey Road was the last album recorded by the band, not Let it Be, etc.), and lastly George's voice. That is not him, and the obvious dubbing of George's interview clips is a great dishonor to George. I have to wonder, too, if the filmmakers created this as fiction. If so, they needed to have researched better.Next we'll be hearing that the MI5 silenced Linda by giving her cancer. Bleh!"
1,Mia Farrow is responsible for John Lennon's death!! Spoiler Alert!!,"I happened to come across this on Netflix last night. I am a conspiracy buff and am only slightly familiar with the PID theory, so I figured I'd give this movie a go. I can't believe the film makers missed the most obvious thing: Mia Farrow is responsible for the death of John Lennon! Follow me: Frank Sinatra divorced Mia Farrow because she wouldn't leave a movie she was contractually obligated to do to star in his (Sinatra's) new movie, The Detective. After he movie wraps, Mia finds herself in India with the Beatles! Mia's movie was Rosemary's Baby! Rosemary's Baby was filmed in the Dakota apartments! John Lennon was living in the Dakota when he was killed! Coincidence?? No way!!Oh, and Heather Mills wasn't even born at the time of the accident, ""George's"" voice is obviously not a match and the audio is way to clean to have been recorded by a stabbing victime recovering in the hospital. Outside of that, I believed every word."
4,Fictional fun with the fab four,"This is a fun video for anyone who has ever had more than a passing interest in the McCartney death rumor/hoax. Historically accurate? Not entirely, as plenty of Beatle minutae geeks will gleefully point out. Logical and coherent? Maybe not, but certainly moreso than the Fabs' own Magical Mystery Tour film. Worth your time? Sure, especially if you're somewhat familiar with Beatles lore in the first place, and if you don't mind a few liberties being taken with the facts! In fact, one of my bandmates commented that if this really IS true, he's a real fan of the fake Paul! If you like this type of thing (and zombies), you may also enjoy a novel calledPaul Is Undead, which re-imagines the Beatles history starting when John Lennon became a zombie..."
2,Amazing Or Horrible,"This film is creepy. Could you imagine continuing to be in a band/family with a stranger who had plastic surgery to look like your friend?To act like this cover up is normal, and not entirely sick is....sickening.Much of the evidence seems like a stretch. MI5 threatens to kill the Beatles of they tell, but they don't want to tell bc of the suicides? How many suicides would happen if the entire band was wacked? lol Major flaw in plot.Almost had me for a minute."
3,"The great ""Paul is Dead"" hoax.","The voice of someone sounding sort-of like George Harrison leads the viewer through all the ""evidence"" that Paul was killed in a car crash around 1965 and replaced by a double. There are some horrible accent lapses and some gaping holes in the evidence if you know the official Beatles history but it makes entertaining viewing if you are an avid Beatles fan - you never know, it could all be true!"
1,mockumentary,i saw this film on netflix. it was catergoried as a mockumentary. you can notice that the songs are not the Beatles or even George. if this was really George then there would have been permission to use the actual song not just the riffs.
2,Dates Messed Up,"They claim McCartney died in November 1966 then they say the remaining 3 put out clues on Rubber Soul and Yesterday and Today which came out before November 1966. Now if he died in November 1965 then it's plausible. Interesting to watch for some ""Paul is Dead"" clues I never heard before. Other than that, the date errors are just terrible. Worth watching once."
4,Excellent DVD!!!,"I am very impressed with the updated graphics when compared with the ""Battle of the Planets"" cartoon that took placed in the 70's to 80's. It did bring back memories but to an upgraded view. This DVD was well worth the wait."
2,Terrible RTS,"If you've actually played a good RTS before, do yourself a favor and pretend Grim Grimoire was never made. There's a reason that nobody has done a side-view RTS before, and that's because IT SUCKS. There just isn't enough scope for your control to make the difference between good play and poor, with the result that battles are tedious tedious tedious."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap",Cheap zippers; both the reflector and case zippers broke on the first day. on the third use the wire frame within the reflector snapped. I would save your money to buy something more durable.
3,gets the job done,"so I picked up this little kit for my growing home studio, it was exactly what I though it would be. The kit includes the 5-1 reflector, stand, and arm. It is not the most ruged thing around. It is top heavy so consider using a sandbag. However the most anoying thing about it is the zipper. It is an average zipper, it gets stuck at times and has a hard time working its way around the large diameter. It can be pretty frustrating. But, all in all the kit works just as described. It is what you pay for. I would recomend it to anyone just starting out."
1,"Not the same design, broken after a short time of use","I purchased two of these to replace 10-year old original parts by Price Pfister. It worked fine initially, but after a month or two, it started leaking water. After inspection, the ceramic disc on the bottom was broken. When I compare with the old part I saved, I found that the bottom portion of the ceramic part was only about half the thickness of the original. No wonder it's so easy to be broken into pieces. So much for the OEM claim. I will get replacements from Price Pfister and never buy anything made by Danco again."
3,Some Things Were Just Not Right...,"First, I want to say that the heroine's mother was a despicable person and her actions really turned me off. It was gross and improper of her to act the way she did. The entire serial murderer part of the story was so weird and creepy. The story itself was not terrible and I feel the author has talent, but parts of the story made no sense and basically creeped me out...*** Spoiler Alert ***Oh and yeah, you just find out that a major important person in your life is a serial killer and just killed 2 people (and a bunch of other innocent folks) practically in front of you and you go bouncing off to bed with your new husband with barely a problem, hardly believable."
3,Looks great in my bathroom........,"I love the the look of this pump. However, after a couple of months the bottle cracks and leaks all over your counter. This has happened to me times already. I rarely use it too."
2,Not 450 mg,"Comes up in an amazon search for ""St John's wort 450"" with a description on the search page as ""St John's Wort 450 mg"" when clearly on the title it is 300mg. I didn't think to check the title when I saw it on the search page but discovered that it was not 450mg when it was delivered. I'm sure it's a good product, and I definitely recommend St John's Wort, but I'm annoyed at the discrepancy."
2,Bomb,"I thought this video was supposed to be a collection of all the places that they visited on the t.v. shows, but it doesn't contain all the places. The actors did a poor job of making it scary. I watched a kids show on Halloween that was scarier than this video. You could watch the people and tell that it was all fake. It is not as scary as the show Fear on MTV."
3,What are the other reviewers talking about????,I just bought the DVD of this title and mine is in breathtaking Technicolor. Was this a problem that was corrected or did the other reviewers have the color turned off on their TV sets?
3,The lovable goofballs are up to their old antics BUT ........,"As expected this latest release has delightful and funny episodes of the lovable loafers. All the episodes are hilarious and very well produced.Then why the three stars? Again, as I stated in my prior review of another LOTSW set there is no insert to go with the DVD. One would expect at the very least a listing of the episodes, date when aired, etc. But there is NOTHING. Even the back face of this set does not have a listing of much worth. Now I paid over $27 for this set and I feel it is quite fair that I should be entitled to some documentation to complement the set. As of today I have about twelve DVD sets of LOTSW. Only ONE of them has some documentation. So when I want to watch a particular episode I have to guess which DVD set to play. For the price I expect better product presentation. ATTENTION: Marketing Department or whoever is responsible for publishing this product - do RIGHT by your customers!"
5,Perfect Pen for Small Animals,We purchased this pen to raise ducklings. It was perfect for this and easy to move around. Folds up into a small package. Would buy again.
2,Michigan: A History of the Great Lakes State,"I was suprised by the two 5 star ratings for this book. I have the second edition in my library and I have not seen the latest edition, so take that into account. Sure, this book has the basics and some interesting details, but photos and maps are an important part of a good history book and it has only a few maps and not an abundance of photos. Many of the photos it does have are somewhat blah. I think you will need to be quite interested in the subject to get much out of this book."
3,HD Fan kit,"No instructions and the parts do not connect together. The metal rails affix to your hard drive and make a 3 1/2"" Hard drive fit into a 5 1/4slot. My wife's case allowed me to just slide the plastic facing with the fans into the front of the slot where I placed the HD without attaching it to the case. 2nd one I've done this way with no problems. The first one I put in has been running 14 hrs a day for 6 months or so, no problems, this one mounted right over it. Quiet and provide some airflow around drive. When you have seven drives in a case, the more air the better."
5,A shallow and dim-wit man's nonsense,"I laugh at a low-down idiot who dares to write debased and groundless articles to fool the audience in US...I talked to my friends: If he needs money, why not ask me and other proud Chinese!!!"
1,Did He Ever Get it Wrong!,"Chang sees China as headed for the scrap heap of history. He sees its 100+ ethnic groups, high unemployment, and growing religious fervor as leading to upheaval.Reality, turned out quite different. China is 92% Han - a single ethnic groups; most others are in rural areas near its borders. China has also proven adept in controlling religious groups - most famously the Falun Gong. And finally, its trade surplus grew sevenfold in the following six years (""In the Jaws of the Dragon"")."
1,Eight years ago...,"Eight years ago, Chang believed China has about five years to get its economy in order before it suffers a crippling financial collapse; it's so true, just the exact crisis is not happening in China. But the biggest problem for people like Chang is not about prediction, it's about their out-dated ideologies of democracy fundamentalsim and market fundamentalism."
4,Enjoyed!,Very much enjoyed the book...character development was great and the emotions real.Thee only reason I didn't give this a 5 was due to a situation she created and in my opinion an unrealistic handling of it. Would have loved to seen an epilogue added.Will definately be viewing more of the author's books.
1,who is the intended audience of this book?,"I really don't relate to this book. I don't really like Christmas either, so maybe that's part of it. And Christmas outside of Christianity and Jesus, well, really, what's the point? Is the intended audience Japanese kids who speak English and have never heard of Christmas? Or maybe 3rd generation Japanese immigrants?I guess the part that I found the most confusing was the odd way that multiculturalism is presented. I suppose because it's an autobiography, the story is relevant to the author in that it really happened, but who cares? Some true stories aren't all that interesting."
2,The book needs more action.,The terminator series are good but this was way down the river. It did have a better storyline than the previous terminator 3 novel. where was the action. It was to quick and not very descriptive. I do not recommend this book to any terminator fansin the least.
4,"Good product, not as pictured.","Weather Tech mats are a good solid product with a great warranty.. Gave it 4 stars because I feared they would not fit in my '06 F-150 since the driver side mat did not look like the picture. The mats did fit and even better, they offer more coverage near the accelerator and brake than shown. The mat is not cut out like it is in the picture on the upper right side."
4,Only in Portuguese,"Only ISBN: 8533609094 is a paperback book published by a Brazilian publisher only in Portuguese, and it has 190 pages well illustrated. It presents works of Alvaro Siza - a recipient of Pritzker prize - the highest award an architect can receive."
2,Don't buy this light,"This light is not what I thought it would be. It's very dim and doesn't have a blink mode which would be more safe for riding at night and having it as a light. I didn't need a light to see with, just a light to alert on coming cars etc as I commute home at night. This light is very dim and I am on the market for a different one. Don't buy it."
1,terrible bracket,"This thing is horrible. The bracket is totally counterintuitive, and even when you do get the hang of it, it just doesn't work. The light flops all over the place."
5,Love Old Movies,"This was a gift for my dad and his ""lady"" friend. He had been looking for this movie on DVD to make his gal pal happy. I was only able to find it on VHS. My dad and his friend both enjoyed the movie."
3,Mediocre text,"Not the best. It's not bad for an intern, but as a resident I didn't find it particularly helpful."
1,This doesn't look good,I ordered my book and everyday i go online to see if it has been shipped and it hasn't. I think i will have to try somewhere else!
4,"Effective program, but use care","I agree with the high ratings other reviewers have given to this program. It works, but you need to pay attention to your body and modify your form if things begin to hurt. I used it for about 2 1/2 years stopped due to repetitive injuries to my knees and elbows. After doing some online research, I found a number of medical articles and abstracts relating to use of weights during aerobic activity. Many of these found a connection between my types of injury and activity similar to heavy hands - especially walking and running with weights. I still use the calisthenics portions of his book, with modifications. I vary this with other types of exercise and I'm fairly injury free now."
4,Great quality! Does the job!!!,"This smoker cover was just what my husband needed. I purchased the Smoke Hollow Smoker as a Christmas gift for him. Since the wonderful spring weather here in Seattle, it's been raining everyday and I forgot to get something to cover his smoker. I wasn't sure if this was going to fit but gave it a whirl and it fits great! There is plenty of room so it's not snug or hard to put on. I love the cinch closure at the bottom. This prevents it from blowing off. The quality of the fabric is great... my husband wishes it was black though because with the color you can see the dirt on it. Still it was worth it!!"
5,Very nice cover,I was very impressed with this cover. It is heavy duty and seemed to be well made. I bought it to fit over a vertical smoker and it looks very nice in my backyard. The one I had before was eaten by squirrels and this one looks heavy enough to defeat them.
1,Unreadable,"The story made absolutely no sense. There was no paragraph indentations. Pretty language, yes, but that's all this book was."
3,Nothing uses SMCs anymore.,"I was hoping I would be able to use this card to shoot some amateur pornography and really give it that vintage look, being that this card is more than 10 years old. But somehow, all of the pictures still look new, but the cameras that use them blow. If you can find a camera that uses SMCs, then you are horribly cheap, and really need to step it up. Even sex offenders use your garden variety point-and-shoot camera these days, and most of those will use either Secure Digital (SD) cards, or some form of Sony's Memory Sticks.You should be ashamed of yourself."
1,Product is sub-standard,"I have now had this card replaced and this new card is having the same problems as my last card. There are intermitent problems with it in regards to some of the images or MP3 files being corrupted. It is very frustrating to be taking pictures and then when you go to download them that can't ""be recognized"". Even worse is spending hours downloading your MP3s and then some of the files can't be read.Stick with a name brand cards--it will be well worth your money."
1,Boring,"I usually love French films, but I could not get into this one. Good thing it was free w/ prime."
3,Prefer the Hardcover Version...,"This is an imaginative little book that makes a great gift. ""A Hole is to Dig"" is a compilation of child-like observations with whimsical pictures. It serves as a delightful reminder to enjoy children and the world around us from their point of view. I usually include this book with a baby shower gift, but the soft cover version just isn't ""gift quality""."
1,"Mena Suvari is hot, but the movie is not!","This movie is really cheesy! I can't believe a movie with such a bad storyline was able to afford relatively big-time actors like C. Thomas Howell and Tom Arnold. However, I've never seen the actor before who plays the lead role, and he definitely does NOT look like a tough guy action hero...come on! At the end of the movie he brags, ""I got into shape""...standing there on the beach with a soft physique and a big gut, and no tan whatsoever. In the first half of the movie, he looks like a bum on the street, and in the second half, he looks like a computer geek. And this hot chick bartender who can get any guy she wants is all over him in both versions of his appearance? Yeah, right. So he can play Nocturne in E flat--big deal. That's about the easiest Chopin piano piece there is! LOLI could go on, but other reviewers provide plenty of insight as to why this movie is lame...read on..."
3,Gift of Gab,Bought this disc thinking it was music for some reason. I don't know if D is big enough to rate a jabber disc but he is a nice guy so I cut him some slack. Best renting this from the library though.....
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"I first heard Madeleine Peyroux playing through the speakers in a Starbucks on a trip to Seattle. Her voice was magical and I just had to ask who it was. I love Billie Holiday and her style of singing is very similar. This cd is a wonderful collection of songs from Patsy Cline's ""Walkin' after midnight"" to Edith Piaf's ""La vie en rose"", you'll love every song. Her other cd ""Careless Love"" is also a wonderful collection. You can't go wrong with this cd, it's simply lovely."
4,M Peroux,Love this voice! I had this album before and wantedto replace it after the first one got destroyed....The melodies and lyrics take me back to another time.
4,"Should be ""Madeleine Holliday""","If you like the sound of Billie Holidays, voice you will be floored by the similarity in Madeleine Peyroux. I hate to say it but her voice sounds almost identical but has more range.The music style isn't totally that old classic jazz sound but similar; some songs seem tinted with a New Orleans sound and some a tiny bit folk-like. Over all smooth, delightful songs. Not one of them is annoying which is lucky when buying an unknown cd."
4,Surprise someone you love--this is a great gift CD,"When I first heard this album on NPR two years ago, I was stunned. Peyroux sounds like Billy Holiday filtered through Patsy Cline by way of Edith Piaf. Her phrasing is fabulous, especially given her young age when the CD was cut. My only gripe is that sometimes she sounds too much like Lady Day, Patsy, or Piaf. I cannot wait for her to develop her own voice and sound--it will be incredible when she matures and deepens. I hope a second album is coming soon--I will get it immediately. Give this as a gift and you will be seen as a true afficianado! By the way, Marc Ribot is on guitar on this album--for another special treat, listen to his Marc Ribot Y Los Cubanos Postizos, a wonderful Cuban-inspired guitar CD."
4,Beautiful jacket,The jacket is great! It fits well the female body. It is good material and the presence is perfect. Recommended!
1,This Woman Has MAJOR Image Issues,"This person has ISSUES! There is a chapter on ""Fat and How Not To Be"" which is very angry and hate-filled towards ANYONE even slightly overweight! (""There is no such thing as a slightly fat person - either you are or you aren't"")Once I found this chapter, i was really in shock and considered getting rid of the book all together. I haven't (yet) and I'm still not sure if I can really take anything in it seriously after discovering this chapter. Also, the ""solutions"" presented are sooo unhealthy - the author speaks of fasting for 4 days and only breaking her fast for a couple of cold glasses of wine.The herbal part of the book was okay, but this chapter just disgusted me beyond belief."
5,close but no cigar,"This book is almost identical to their previous edition, dated 1993. The sample test provides you with an insight into the GENERAL areas that you need to study, but the test is MUCH HARDER. Any guidance is better than none but the mathmatical portion should be much tougher that what it is. All in all, if you are going to take the test, as I did, this book will provide you with the ENTRY LEVEL mathematics, which is where you need to BEGIN."
4,A fun read.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book in the Arabian Nights vein, and I intend to read the others in the series."
1,Don't buy from discovery store,"They shipped only 1/12 of the order, did not respond to email inquiry, and amazon removed my comment (along with many others') from their seller's rating."
5,Another fine Tintin adventure,"I've enjoyed the Adventures of Tintin series since I was a child. The combination of good art, interesting plots, and local detail which looked (to my untravelled eye) authentic, got and kept my attention through all 21 titles in the series.In _The Broken Ear_, Tintin investigates the theft from a museum of a small statue with a broken ear. His investigations take him to South America, where the rain forest tribe that originally made the statue lives.Unlike some of Tintin's adventures, which have fantastic or science fictional elements, this is a pure mystery / adventure comic which I highly recommend.If you like the Adventures of Tintin, you may also enjoy the Asterix series, by Goscinny and Uderzo."
3,Leaking Product,"This is a good product. Other than making my dogs hair shiny and healthy, it also eliminates dog body odor as well as fecal odor. Normally, my bullmastiff smells after 4-5 days after her bath,I noticed that with this product, even after 2 weeks from bath, she still doesn't smell dog.. Great product however, upon my reorder, when I received the product, it is already less 20% since the smelly salmon oil leaked. I hope the shipper will be more careful in packing this item next time to avoid spillage and loss."
3,"Dogs love it, husband hates the smell","My dogs love the taste of the fish oil but the smell is very strong and my husband hates it. I would only suggest it to someone who does not mind the smell of fish. Not only is the smell strong, it stays around for quite awhile."
4,Dogs with sensitive stomachs,"I have two boxers. They both love the Grizzly Salmon oil. I have a 6 year old and a 1 year old boxer. My one year old has a very sensitive stomach to food and treats. She also was starting to get spots on her head where she would loose hair. After a month of using the Grizzly oil everyday. The hair has grown back on her head and she has not thrown up. I recommend this product for healthier skin, fur and dogs with sensitive stomachs."
5,shes loves it,"i don't know how good its supposed to be for my dog yet, but i know that she loves it."
3,good stuff,nothing too much to say. they love it. the dogs that is. not sure what it really does for them
4,For the dogs,"We started giving our dogs this supplement last fall and their coat is shiny and very soft. My husband complains about their breath right after their meal, but it goes away eventually. Our pug has some skin issues (seasonal allergies) and this product has helped with the appearance of his hot spots. It's not a cure, but it has certainly helped."
4,Good product,"This is a good product. It does have a smell to it, but I keep it in the fridge and that seems to help. My dog did get sick the first time he ate it, but no problems since."
2,Salmon oil,My dog didn't like it at first but now he doesn't mind it. I haven't seen any difference in his hair growth tho :-/
5,Easy to use low odor product,"I have 3 labs so obviously we go through a large amount of product. This packaging is convienient for quickly getting it onto their food. Their coats are all sleek and very soft.Salmon odor is not overwhelming. We will definately be purchasing the product again. It's a great value for the price, and clearly top quality."
4,Dog loves this,I had been giving my dog fish oil pills but she would find them in her food and not eat it. When I pump this oil on her dry food she goes crazy! She loves this and it's so good for her. Great product.
4,Good for my beagle mix,"Got this as a supplement for my beagle mix. She is 25 lbs so I just add one pump of this stuff to her dry food. She seems to love it and I noticed that it has made her hair super soft now. The bottle was leaking so the oil was all over the bag and the bottle when it arrived, I took it out and washed it but I couldn't get rid of the smell for a day. I'm not a big fan of the fishy smell so I keep it in the fridge and I can barely smell it now. I was a little worried that my dog would have negative reactions to this product as several other users have but she's fine, her poop was a little soft for the first 3 days but it seems normal now."
4,Ultimate German Beginner-Intermediate(CD/Book),"I am living in Germnay, so I decided to take a German I class. I have just finished German I and have found the book and especially the CD's of great help. I listen to the CD's everyday and find that this is very helpful for pronunciation."
4,Good learning tool,A great tool to use with the CD's and a class. Need to know the definitions for English grammar like definite and indefinite articles and the like. For the very beginner it did not do a good job of going over pronunciation.
4,wow,"I love Hewitt's acting, but, I never thought her voice would be so beautiful. I never would have imagined someone of her acting talent, could have vocal cords like that. I loved the CD."
1,It's all right for an actress.,"Her songs were nice but they sound too much like bubble-gum music. I like Jennifer Love Hewitt but I was disappointed with her CD. Her songs were not unique and that's part of the reason I didn't like her CD. Good thing I borrowed the CD from a friend instead of buying it. Instead, I bought Sarah Mc Lachlan's CD, which happens to be awesome."
4,its a pleasure to hear her songs,i love the cd cant believe she can sing so well its the only cd of hers i bought since i thought shes not good but im wrong .keep up the good work.pls have another album
3,GEMS AND REFUSE,"I didn't know she could sing too! When I saw it I never had heard of it before. Its the first (and last!) time I ever shoplifted. Her songs are good. I can relate to much of what she is saying. Alas, but on some selections there are horses running in the background that detract from the song itself. Sing for us Jen! But do it from inside."
5,"THE BEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD, GET IT NOW","HI People i'am from Australia (Perth) and i just have to say that this is the best album i have ever heard in my life. I just had to get it no matter what, The songs are absolutly beautiful i can't believe she had so much talent. Well i did know but yeah this is the greatest i must get where-ever you are. If ya LOVE her as much as me get it and support it. See ya ..."
3,WELL...,"Her voice seems wooden, and her enthusiasm forced, but a few good tunes recommend it for younger adolescent females. She is charming and has great beauty...then it would be nice if she could learn to reveal those qualities in her musical work."
5,GREAT RESOURCE!!!,"After having/using this book for a number of years I recently purchased this book for the second time because I accidentally left it on the trasit @ the airport. It has been such a great help to me and my friends. For each dis-ease or condition there are various options given for healing. (herbal, naturapathy etc.) I love natural remedies and healing methods and this book is my favorite and most used resource...GET IT! : )"
2,"Why are there no reviews of, 'By Design?'","Whilst it's difficult to dislike either Richard E Grant or this, his new book, 'By Design', I do feel that it's a fairly shallow read. Hyped as a, 'from the horse's mouth' style expose, it's really just a hollywood versio of Terry Southern's, 'The Magic Christian'; Grant's obssessed with the excess and hysteria of LA but brings no subtlety or originality to the subject. Nicely written for an actor - if that isn't damning with faint praise, I don't know what is."
5,Works as advertised,Well worth the price. Was able to charge my cell phone on a long motorcycle trip. Also used it to charge my mp3 players while riding.
2,Be careful,This nicely constructed connector is not appropriate for general use with the Kintrex SPC0601. The red lead of this connector will actually be hooked up to the negative contact on the charger. While it is possible to switch the battery connections it is not something for the uninitiated.
4,"Great for some batteries, not all though","These are great units but if you are going to attach the quick disconnect to a modern automotive battery installed in an auto, think twice. Newer battery cables do NOT allow these rings to attach to the battery at the battery posts. You'll have to connect the 'Rings' to another positive and negative terminal location.If using on an auto, a better option is the cigarette lighter/power plug unit. (...)Quality of the unit is very good. 4 stars because they don't say, will not work on all battery's. Also, the rings are not large enough to accomodate an automotive battery cable post attachment. The holes must be enlarger unless you are attached to other than the atcual battery10/2/2011 Update: Three years later and the unit has run 24/7 all that time and still going great. Change to 5 stars +"
4,As expected,"Works, charges, nice to have the inline fuse but nothing really to say. (adding words to reach the minimum for posting a review)"
3,I have not used it yet,"I have used the solar powered charger, which work just OK. But I have not used the pig tail yet. I may not need the pig tail."
1,Wrong polarity,I bought 2 of these battery leads to hook up to a Kintrex solar charger. The connectors are polarity sensitive so you can't do anything wrong. After turning the system on nothing happened. Trouble shooting the wires I found that the battery lead rings that connect to the battery are reversed wired. Both wire leads were the same that I bought. Fortunately nothing was destroyed with the faulty wiring but just a headsup to the next person who wires these parts.
2,Ordered 3 and only 2 worked. 1 had a fault or short in it.,"I order 3 of these to hook to a float charger to keep the battery on my lawn mowers charged. They seemed to be of good quality, reasonable price and were shipped out quickly as expected. 2 worked fine. One didn't. I switched the fuse out and still didn't work, switched the cable and the new one worked on the same mower. Switch bad cable to mower that had one working already and it didn't work. Price was good but it wasted my time and I will still need to get a third one. I would order someone else next time."
5,just what I needed,"it was as listed, fit the bike fine, & gave me the lead wires to make it easy to keep my ready when ever I wanted to ride!"
5,"For my taste, this is her best cookbook to date.","The chocolate, pine nut tart is yummy. The zuchinni risotto is to die for. Truly fits with my cupboard staple items. Humorous at times, well written, receipes are straight forward and well organized. The index is cross referenced. For the cook who enjoys cooking from stratch but is working outside the home--perfect."
1,Not much to like here.,"If recipes like Fillet of Beef in Tomato, Caper, and Anchovy Sauce; Wild Mushroom Polenta with Thyme and Aged Goat Cheese; Pan-Sauteed Swordfish with Anchovies, Garlic and Tomato Fondue and Cappellini with Pan-Seared Calamari, Tomatoes, and Lemon sound like spur of the moment then this is the book for you. Very little in this book looked as though I could just go to the kitchen and whip something up. I will be donating this book to charity."
3,Dispenser,Great concept but wished it came with a clip on for a table to keep it stationary and out of sight.
3,"A decent start, but lacking","I used this system as my second attempt to teach myself Irish, but like the previous course I followed, this one failed me. There are lots of exercises and cute culture notes in each chapter, and the vocabularies are decent. However, this book lacks thorough grammar explanations. Once I got into the 6th lesson, I was having questions about different usages that the book simply didn't answer. It tended to brush over most grammar points to teach you the absolute basics.This book is good for a tourist who wants to spend a few days in an Irish speaking area, but is terrible for the serious student."
2,not my favorite,Her other devotion books are better than this one. This has been my least favorite of them. She is a great writter but this one was too specific for me.
4,Very Good Homeopathic Book for Pets,"This is a really good book to own, but it's best to have a better understanding of homeopathy by receiving formal training. There are many insightful remedies for pets."
5,Gotta Have It,"I like every song on this cd, if you enjoy reggae roots and culture you will enjoy it as well. This cd does not disappoint and if you have not seen Luciano live please treat yourself don't deny yourself."
5,Great release from a band that should have gone further,"It's a shame that Off-Broadway only produced two major releases. They were a solid band with a great sound and wonderful songwriting. ""On"" is a really great record and should have been promoted more at the time. The following release, ""Quick Turns"" was promoted even less and the band was doomed. If you are reading this and wondering if you should check it out, the answer is definitely. A top-notch release from the early eighties."
5,"the best power pop album ever.this is it.,,,,mike york austin/rockford",full moon turned my head around.is the most contaggious soungs yor brain has ever heard.most people havnt this album was manly cliff johnson the lead singer.just because he didnt look like robin zander.who cares johnson is gifted in his writing.he can through down the bad ass power pop and its almost like showtunes to jazz. so enjoy him if you can.for sure buy. m. y.
4,nice,"Tiger Stripe looks same as used in Viet Nam. Has a used look, but new. One of the best night camo made."
4,Great shirt!,I got the shirt W/the pants! I couldn't be more pleased with this shirt. I'm retired from the military this is a great remake of the original Vietnam style tiger Camos! Buy this! It was delivered in one day! Don't 4get the pants!
5,~~~~~,"G. Bernard Shaw was a great playwright and that is the reason why his plays tend to outshine his novels. Nonetheless, this is a five-star novel and it should not be so hard-to-get."
5,Capezio Women's 199 Tendu II Pointe Shoe,"Simply said, it's the right shoe at the right price for the ballet dance classes. I was able to find the right size and a half."
1,tejano music review,"After so long trying to get a hold of this album, I finally did, and it really wasn't all that, I would imagine for it being there first album you would think it would be awesome,and I say this because they have a second album called ""93"" and after hearing this album maaaaan now that is one of the best albums in tejano music thar I've heard,now that one is one of my fav. Well the debut album is ok,u can preview some songs on the internnet,just google that album ,I've seen it and played it on there,hope this helps."
4,Makes You Want to Build a Sled,"We (Dutile Kids) thought it was a good book because it sort of taught you a lesson about not always having to have the best things, and to have faith in yourself. It kept our interest because the descriptions were good enough to let us use our imaginations. We were always curious about what the sled would look like in the end, and to want to build our own sleds.Some of us though, thought it was a little too predictable, but still enjoyed it."
3,engrossing thriller,"This book is great reading for the beach or weekend. It moves quickly with a decent plot. The characters tend to be a little cardboard, particularly the villans. Du Brul does for geology what Clancy does for weapons systems-makes the subject interesting and the details give momentum to the story.With the villan (Kerikov) living to fight again, I'm anxious to read the next installment of the story"
2,Not Clive Cussler,"I was looking for a Cussler-esque adventure for my recent vacation and read a few reviews of DuBrul's books. They seemed mostly positive, so I bought a couple thinking they would be good for long airplane flights, afternoons in the sun, etc.Sadly, both Charon's Landing and Vulcan's Forge were mind-numbingly slow, the action sequences were nothing special, the characters were wooden stereotypes, the heroes were no better than the villains, etc. There really was nothing to hold my attention from chapter to chapter. Mercer (the hero) acts like a pubescent boy looking down the top of every blouse and up the slit of every skirt, and DuBrul can't seem to write a decent piece of dialogue between a man and a woman.Ultimately, I read both books, but it took the better part of a month to get through them (I usually read a Clive Cussler novel in about 2 days) because I kept putting them down and picking up other books that held more promise.I won't be buying any more DuBrul."
5,cant say enough....,Just cant say enough about this company and their products. Very well done and craftmanship. These are unique for your home or to give as gifts. I always get high praise when I give them and for the ones I have in my home. Have got some before from other companys and they have not been as top notch as these are. they are packaged well and delivered in a good time frame. You cant go wrong. The hard part is choosing which design you want.
5,All things Monkees,"If you loved these video fab-four, then YOU - my friend - owe it to yourself to mow lawns, wash cars, babysit or any of those other pimply-faced jobs that will wisk you bak to the days when the Monkees were the coolest thing on televison. They were M(onkee)TV in the '60s! This box has evey episode, the once-aired (and only once) ""33 &1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee,"" the never-aired pilot and many commercials ('cause THAT is what the whole thing was about, after all) ... each have been reprodusced from the original 35mm prints ... Yes, it's worth the trip!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
5,A Monkees Review!!,This is truly a great show. The songs are super. The guys are so funny. If you love the Monkees I strongly suggest buying this box set. I have the box set and I just love it.
1,Product Size in Title is Misleading,"I bought this item for my 42"" firepit. The title is misleading and I thought that this cover was meant for firepits up to 44"". However, the cover itself is only 44"" so it barely covered my table. The screen dome would not fit underneath it. The quality of the product appears to be excellent. Just the size was misleading. I have returned it and bought the Large Veranda Firepit cover which is 60"" in diameter."
1,Tastes like leather,"The water tastes very strongly of leather. I'm not overly picky about how my water tastes, but it is pretty bad. Of the 2 times I used this, the first time it didn't taste that bad, but the second was overpowering. The only guess I can make as to why this is is the temperature. First use was in modest circumstances of about 60-70 degrees. Second time out it was 90-95 degrees. Could be that the hotter temperature brings out the taste more. Either way, not too happy with it. Too bad, cause I really liked it."
5,"Easy instructions, great Celtic history & beautifully drawn","These tarot cards are a must-have for any tarot-lover! They include detailed but clear instuctions for several reading spreads. Each cards meaning is also fully explained. Their Celtic origins and history are a plus for people of all ancestries. The illustrations are just the icing-on-the-cake, beautifully drawn. They have definately been a great source of fun!"
2,acceptable,An ok rigging knife for the price. I had knock off version from one of the marine supply stores that was a little better quality.
5,Rigging Knife,"One very sharp knife. I've had occation to use the marlin spike several times. It is very useful for getting into tight watersoaked knots. The stainless steel seems to be of good quality. I have no complaints about this item at all.The price is good, the shipping is fast. It works and is a good value."
4,A Year of Apple Seasons....,"Its nice to have material for my 6 year old and 3 year old that introduces them to new concepts at their level. Both children could relate to the gentle, pleasant people in the drawings and walked with them through the apple trees in the winter with their hidden buds, through the blooms in spring, the summer and finally picking time --the fall! There are many facts in the back of the book which I enjoyed but went over the heads of my little ones."
3,"Just like some people, this is an OK review","This book is a good way to start reviewing for your Praxis II Math. However, just like some of the reviewers here, I agree that the three practice tests were too easy compared to the real test. I bought additional practice tests online that were of or similar to the test difficulty level.I took the test on March 13, 2010. The test was difficult. I was expecting some calculus integration and easy matrix problems that you can just pop in to your T1-83, but I did not have those kinds of problems in this month's test. I do recommend for test takers to review log/ln/e^x problems involving decay/exponential growth, creating a trig graph (all six) with phase shifts, and functions because they had some hard questions regarding those topics.Good luck to all teachers, past, present, and future!"
2,Better than REA but still too simple,"Sample tests too simple and gave a false sense of security, but had fewer typo errors than REA prep book which was worse. Both books need to be rewritten with more difficult sample tests that better reflect the actual 0061 test level compatible with test given in January 2008."
3,Not difficult enough,"The review sections of this book were excellent, but the practice tests were about 1/10 the difficulty of the actual test, so it gave me a sense of false confidence going in. Use this book more for the review sections than the practice tests."
1,not worth a penny,"book is a waste of time. better off buying materials from ets. just used for 2010 praxis 0061. got 85 90 and 82 on each of the practice exams in this book. thought i was good. then exam was like stepping in front of a bus. praxis exam wasnt that bad but the practice exams are not representative of what you will see on exam. these practice exams were too easy, which to me is a waste of time. the 3 practice exams = 6 hrs you could be doing something useful."
1,Terrible,Do NOT use this book for the current 2011 Math Content knowledge Praxis II. The Praxis is completely different. Not ONE question on the practice test is relevant to the current PRAXIS exam. Only use the Study Guide/Practice Tests that the PRAXIS company offers.
1,not worth the money,I am a paper maker so I am always looking for new books. This book was not worth $28.00. I returned it.
4,Great after Broken in!,"This is my second pair of rainbows (the first pair were premium leather, and I did not know that if they got wet, you had to dry them immediately- so they started to get pretty gnarled). These are great, durable sandals - great for school, since they dont require you to take them off if you have to walk through water. They do hurt your feet for the first few days, so I break them in via many short trips in them, not one whole day, which I did in my leathers, which made my feet feel like s***! The ones I bought were black, so they dont show dirt as easily. I do miss the different colored rubber on the side, but thats minor. Plus, theyre cheaper and more ""eco-friendly"" than the leathers!"
2,Comfortable...but these sandals STINK!,"I had a pair of leather Rainbows for about 2 years, but they started to crack. I decided to try the hemp ones, read good things. They are definitely comfortable and have held up well except for one thing...they wreak! I don't have dirty feet and my other shoes don't smell at all, but these things are embarrassing.I would recommend paying the extra $10 and getting leather sandals, you won't regret it!"
4,Good Ole Album,"Very satisfied w/the album. Love ""Trashy Women"". If you like ""The Railroad"", you'll like the album."
1,Don't waste your money,"After reading all the negative reviews I decided to take a chance and order this product for my new Nokia phone only to find out that it didn't have a cord compatible with my phone. So I contacted the manufacturer and waited for over a month for them to mail me a cord compatible with my phone (not to mention all the emails I had to send them asking for a status on the shipping of the cord). When I finally got it I was excited to try it. When I plugged it in to my phone I could see the battery ""charging"" BUT: 1. when I unplug it, it never shows that the battery was charged even a bit, regardless of how long it was charging or what type of battery I use 2. every few minutes it stops ""charging"" and I have to unplug it and plug it back in to ""wake"" it up. It's a pain! Save your money."
2,"Fine for novices and those who don't mind the ""homemade"" look","As an experienced sewer and someone who has to alter nearly every item of clothing I purchase, I was really looking forward to getting this book, based on the reviews. However, this book is a joke. It offers very little in the way of TRUE altering--ideas like ""Make an elastic band to hold too-long sleeves up around your elbows"" does NOT qualify as good technical advice, in my humble opinion. The ""fashions"" (if you can call them that) recommended in this book are grossly outdated (I suspect they were already passe even in 1995 when the book was printed), and they all have a grossly home-fashioned look to them. If you are really into baubles, embellishments, and that frumpy ""mom made it"" look, buy this book. If you are looking for a good guide to TRUE altering, spend your money elsewhere. My new copy is getting donated to the library."
5,Great reading,"A great story about a great man, well, just a boy really. I'm amazed how someone so young could train and fly a Spitfire in the Battle of Britain. His writings are well produced and not in the style of a hero. Just how these boys handled the stress is beyond me, many died and many, including the author, suffered mentally. Todays kids could do well to read this and see what is possible when one really works at it."
2,Not good Rush,"Ok this album just isn't up to it, the production is pretty bad the songwriting isn't really there just about the only thing that saves this CD are the lyrics and the best songs on it are just average. And they are the title cut along with the two singles, plus the jam session ""Limbo"" and ""Virtuality"". So all in all don't buy this album unless you are a die hard Rush follower and I know to some of you that average Rush tunes are good tunes in general, but take my word for it the production is way off so they all don't sound nearly as good as they could have. I gotta end it with this album is a lot of filler, so if you don't mind that pick it up hey who am I to stop you, but if you want good Rush then don't and wait for the new one it will come out within the next six months and I am sure it will be better."
4,Rush bring it home!,"In our modern and jaded age, it is refreshing to hear an incredible band such as Rush defy the shallowness of contemporary music and summon up a work as powerful as 'Test for Echo.' The lyrics prove themselves to be as poignant as ever, Lifeson's guitars are unrelenting and melodic, Neil Peart's drumming is...well, come on now, it's Neil Peart...and Geddy Lee's bass playing and vocals are at once synchronized and profound. It is, in short, a more than worthy release from a band that has seen it's fair share of releases. And now, with Rush rejoined and working on new studio material for the first time since this 1996 release, I think it is doubly important for us to hear this great album, and glean from it what we can expect from Rush in the future. Such tracks as 'Test for Echo', 'Driven', 'Totem', and 'Dog Years' remind the listener that this is a band, not only alive and kicking, but never missing a step of the race!"
4,Not Bad,"Test for Echo continues the return to heaviness that began in earnest on Counterparts. Most songs are good, especially the title track and the instrumental ""Limbo."" Indeed, the only subpar song is ""Totem,"" though ""Carve away the Stone"" is somewhat generic. All other songs feature great instrumentation as usual, especially ""Virtuality"" with its awesome dynamics (despite somewhat corny lyrics). That said, Neil Peart has some really good lyrics here, especially ""Half the World,"" ""The Color of Right,"" ""Time and Motion,"" and ""Dog Years,"" Rush's first real attempt at humor. This is also the first album where Peart committed to his redesigned drumming style, and his playing is more ""on the beat"" than ever, though I must say that I like the ""classic"" style better. The main reason is that I feel he rides his cymbals too much. Despite these minor gripes, this is another worthwhile album from Rush."
4,Would be a classic for most mortal bands,"I don't think many other bands have the same expectations that Rush has when they make a new album. All know that Lifeson is a guitar god, Lee is a master at bass and a wonderful singer, and Peart is the last great classical drummer. Moreover, they have so many other great albums in their catalog. Man, it has to be intimidating for these guys to even step in the studio, knowing what their fans expect of them. For the record, this is a good album, has some really hard-driving cuts, such as ""Driven."" No, it is not ""Power Windows"", it does not have the complexity and diversity. But it still rocks and I know of a lot of bands that would kill to be able to claim this recording as their own."
2,Not good Rush,"Ok this album just isn't up to it, the production is pretty bad the songwriting isn't really there just about the only thing that saves this CD are the lyrics and the best songs on it are just average. And they are the title cut along with the two singles, plus the jam session ""Limbo"" and ""Virtuality"". So all in all don't buy this album unless you are a die hard Rush follower and I know to some of you that average Rush tunes are good tunes in general, but take my word for it the production is way off so they all don't sound nearly as good as they could have."
2,Among Their 3 Worst Records,"Test For Echo sounds just plain and tired. It has moments that recall past glories,a cool riff or two,and possibly has some of Peart's best lyrics,despite what anyone says. Yet the tunes are not memorable at all. I rate it a hair above Roll The Bones and Presto(Counterparts was a brief comeback).The title cut is my favorite,which is typical of the formula of later Rush albums,best goes first then downhill from there.Also,Geddy's vocals,which showed some signs of life on Counterparts,have returned to the robotic,monotone delivery we older fans loathe. A friend of mine who's lost more than a few brain cells due to substance abuse actually thinks these songs are 'classics'in the same league as 'Fly By Night' and 'Lakeside Park'. I think he's well,lost some brain cells."
5,A masterpiece that gets better with time,"When I first listened to Test for Echo it was in a store with headphones. I bounced around from one track to another, neither satisfied nor dissappointed by what I heard. I chose not to buy it. One year later I picked it up on a whim. I took it home and gave it another chance. I liked it, but not that much. I kept listening to it periodically over the next month and found myself humming the tunes at work, and ""air drumming"" to many of the Peart parts. The next thing I knew I loved it, and realized how much energy, power, and fun there was behind each piece. In the four years since it remains one of the few CD's that I play consistently, and enjoy every time. I think that fans who are ambiguous about Test For Echo should give it another chance, try not to compare it to other works and really LISTEN to the supurb mixing, production, and songwriting that is inherent in each tune. You may be surprised at how it grows on you."
5,It just grows on you...,"I've been listening to Rush ever since I picked up All the World's a Stage back in the late '70s, so I bought this as soon as it came out (a while back now) and wasn't sure about it at first. It had a harder edge to it than I had become used to with the past few offerings. However, now that I've listened to it more I think it's the best they've produced for a while, possibly as far back as Moving Pictures. Ok, with the exception of Counterparts. Could their association with Peter Collins on production be a factor? Whatever, more power to their collective elbows!"
2,Another Disappointment,"It has been years since I have bought a Rush CD so I thought I would catch up. I bought Vapor Trails last week and was shocked by the lack of guitar solos. This CD has more guitar solos but they are all very short and most of them are simple and uninspired. To me hard rock has always been about great instrumental solos (guitar, organ, etc). Without them it is like eating a hot fudge sundae without the hot fudge.It seems like the boys have decided that Alex will be little more than a rhythm guitarist, which is sad because he has played good solos in the past. It seems like a waste of talent.Yes, Neil does write good lyrics but listening to Geddy singing almost non-stop song after song becomes rather boring."
3,Not bad.........not great.,"This is not the best documentary, but it does make a good case against Wal-mart. I use to work at Wal-mart and know first hand many of the things they say are true. Wal-mart cares nothing for people except to use them. This movie is not the greatest but worth watching."
1,"Poor, Poor, Poor","This documentary was not only very poorly produced in terms of direction, editing, sound mixing, titles, etc... but the information presented was very poorly researched and presented. The documentary is VERY biased, not seeking to understand or explore Wal-Mart, but wanting to destroy it at any cost. Most of their arguments have EASY explanations and counterpoints. I am a documentary film graduate and feel like I wasted 1hr 45min of my life after watching this."
1,Stop Whining!,"If you don't like working for low wages - then quit!! It's that simple. There are other jobs out there. Stop lobbying against Wal Mart, instead, start lobbying against NAFTA. Bring back products made in the USA and Wal Mart will be a thing of the past. This video was a complete waste of time."
2,waste of time,i hate people that talk bad about wal-mart but then come payday your in the store spending away.if you don't it don't go
5,changed my life,"Greenwald is a superb documentarian. I knew I did not like Walmart's practices, but this movie helped me to have the words I need to tell others why it is a bad company"
2,Somewhat repetetive and tedious,The topic is very interesting and the stories of the victims were interesting and instructive. Multiple views of the same shot were tedious. I began to feel that I was being treated as a rather dim bulb.
3,No objectivity whatsoever,"This documentary is as biased as they come. Its one and only purpose is to paint Wal-mart as the devil. With zero objectivity, they guide the viewer into learning about the evils of Wal-Mart; and evil they may be but, a little objectivity may have been good. The documentary does raise some interesting things that the general public may not know (I learned quite a few things). The documentary is a bit too long and boring, but interesting nonetheless."
4,Law & Order - The Fourth Year (1993-1994 Season),Law & Order - The Fourth Year (1993-1994 Season) is a very good year for TV.
2,Poor Disk Quality Continues,"I really like this program. I have been watching it for only a short time and I am currently on the fourth season.The series itself deserves four or five stars. However, the ultra cheap quality of the disks continues. There is little fanfare here. The producers of the DVD series have done their very best to release the disk sets in as an economical manner as possible. The episodes are all on two sided disks - yep, as cheap as it gets! That said, I have had only one defective disk so far.My DVD collection is rather large, and the material quality of most is quite good. It is unfortunate that these disks are so poorly produced. This is an excellent series."
5,Goldbarth Does it Again!,"Simply put, this is a wonderful book, a great addition to any library and a must for any reader interested in Goldbarth's work and his impact on contemporary poetry."
5,Wooden airplane,My grandsons loved these airplanes. They played with them for hours until one got stuck in a tree. Then they had fun trying to get it out. Finally with the help of a garden hose squirting water on it the plane came down. And it still worked after getting all wet. Would recommend this to anyone who has kids or grandkids age 8 or older
1,Horribly boring,"There was very little ""how-to"" in this video. It mostly consisted of interviews with the strippers (which had very little ""instruction"") and interviews with ""average"" men and women as to their feelings about a wife stripping to their husband. The only instructional part was very brief and very vague. No actual ""steps"" were given. I feel horribly ripped off."
5,Its this Movie Collection Full Screen/,i would like to buy this movie but first i want to know if this movie its full screenits a great deal its five movies and they are the best
4,AWESOME CD,THAT CD ROCKED! Don't forget to go to http://www.peta2.com/ot/o-kyi.asp?c=56 to see an interview with KYI! You can win free stuff too!
3,Idioms for more advanced learners.,"This book is very useful in parts: some of the idioms are very easy to incorporate into sentences. However, my main and only gripe about this book is that the translations are not literal. Learners of Italian can read the sample pages provided with this book on Amazon and see that the explanations do not exactly correspond within the context of the sentences. For beginner/intermediate level students of Italian such as myself, this book can be very frustrating when it comes to wanting to know what the non-idiomatic parts of the examples mean.I recommend this book for more advanced learners of Italian because only higher level students will be able to fully appreciate what it being said in this book. Nevertheless, you could learn it parrot fashion if that is the way you prefer to learn.A useful book regardless."
3,Not as helpful as I would have liked.,"I had high hopes for this book, but it was a bit of a let down. It contains older, more ""classic idioms,"" and gives examples of how they are used in both Italian and English. On a more negative note, it is a little bit outdated, and some of the more common idioms of today are not in it."
4,No closure on the rocket,On the Blast Off episode: I want to know how Rick & the team got that rocket back out of the hole they drilled. The show ended without telling us how the rocket was removed.
1,One of the best comedys of the year,I got this book from the library and am I glad that I did. I started reading and could not stop laughing.The author uses hilarious agruments about how you can anticipate what a person is going to say as proof that we are evolving into Gods. As if people in the past never anticipated what someone else was going to say or do.Very weak theories. The author did not accomplish the purpose of the book unless the purpose was to make people laugh. A close second to Jerry Seinfeld's Seinlanguage.
5,First Birthday Present,"I bought this toy for my best friend's son's 1st birthday. He loved the fire truck and the bell !! Shipping was fast and it had to be put together such as the bell, sterring, the wheels, the ladder etc. It really was a perfect gift. He is tall for his age so he can managae it quite well and it turns pretty good too.. Get this toy - you won't be disappointed!"
4,A New and Dark Christmas Classic,"Not everyone has heard of this film and they aren't likely to because it comes to us from Finland, but for those people looking for something a little dark and very funny, this will hit the spot."
3,There are better switches out there,"This switch is adequate but there are better switches out there.I bought this switch for my son's room and it's really fine but I found a much better switch for my family room.Search Amazon for this control ""CT100 Wall/Hand Held Remote by Monte Carlo"".It's an Amazon sponsored Link.But you should know...This switch needs 110 volt power. It doesn't need to be connected to the fan because this is a wireless switch.The WT150 (this product) uses a battery and that's the main reason I don't like it compared to the CT100 (no battery)."
1,"It's junk, expensive junk that eats batteries in a week.","Our Monte Carlo fan came with one of these and it worked fine until the original batteries needed to be replaced. After that, each new battery we have put in it had been dead within a week. After calling the folks at Monte Carlo and trying to reset the connection on it we have given up. OH! That big warranty they offer on their fans - motor ONLY. So, you're SOL if you expect them to replace this unit on warranty.I'm going to do as the other poster suggested and search for a different control that will work with this fan.I'm VERY dissatisfied with this."
3,My grandson loved this DVD,I bought this African Safari DVD as a Christmas present in December. It was a wonderful gift as my grandson loved this DVD!
5,Heavy Duty and Solid,Very duarable cover. Solid construction and should last for years. It fits my Ducane grill very well! Great purchase for the money!
5,Fabulous product,"The quality of material (heavy duty fabric) , perfect fit and super practical features such as snap straps for legs for windy locations and large lifting loops for removal and replacing along with the bottom draw string make this the best grill cover I've ever owned."
4,"Good quality, light tan bbq cover","This is an excellent bbq cover. I bought the X-large to fit over my genesis plantinum b grill. It fits with some room to spare (but the large would be a tad too small as the grill portion is off center). I don't use the zippered pocket to store anything. The pull cords keep it snug around the base and the straps have a clip to attach to the legs. The color is a light tan and the light color will stain easily, but I'm hoping it won't show sun fading as much. I've had the cover for about a month and am quite pleased. Much better quality than the big box store covers available."
4,"2nd one in 2&1/2 years, but best I've had","I just ordered this one to replace the same one I purchased in June of 2009. It had held up well until a few days ago I noticed the fabric had rotted clear through on one side. My grill is stored outside and subject to the weather, so this may be about as much as can be expected from any cover??Just received my new one today and noticed they claim it has a 3-year warranty, but strangely, no information is included about the warranty process.I still say it's the best cover out there and certainly the best looking. It's made very well and of quality materials.I would still buy this cover again, when it gets too old to protect my grill."
4,Great grill cover!!,This is a great grill cover!! It functions wonderfully and is appealling to the eye. Great product. Would highly recommend to anyone.
5,Actually quite nice,Got this to replace original Vermont castings 10 year old cover.It has a nice look and feel I think it will last for quite a while.
5,Great grill cover,"The cover is very attractive, easy to use and easy to clean. Fits the grill perfectly, we are enjoying this purchase and definitely recommend this product."
4,Better than anything I could find locally!,"works great on my 58"" grill, very high quality, better than anything I have found locally and at a much better price. the stretch cords and velcro straps on the bottom are of no use with my grill design, would need some bungee cords to cinch it tight, but cover is pretty heavy and fits well."
5,Couldn't be better!,"This is absolutely the very best BBQ cover I have ever owned. It is a light color so it doesn't absorb a lot of heat and end up cracking from the sun - like black covers do. It has handles which make it simple to lift up and off of the BBQ with. And, it's made of very heavy duty, durable material, but still relatively lightweight. It would be difficult for anyone to make a better cover than this one!"
4,Perfect Fit!,"This cover is super heavy duty, attractive, and fits nicely over our BBQ. We keep our grill up on a covered veranda, so it is already protected somewhat, but it does get alot of wind. We were suprized to find that this cover stays in place without the ties at the bottom being used. When we get a blizzard coming, we'll fasten the bottoms and I have no doubt it will stay in place just fine.Side note: This cover is hheeaavvvy! Let husband take it on and off the grill. (It's his job to do the grilling anyway....Right?!)I only gave it four stars because I need to see how it does in the summer under our high mountain UV rays."
5,Great looking heavy duty cover,"Last year I bought what was advertised as a heavy duty grill cover and it did not last more than three months before shredding in the wind. This one is truly heavy duty and it looks great,too.And to think this one was only $4. more than the first one I bought. This one is a great value."
2,IT LEAKED!,The medium fits perfectly on my Weber S-330. We shall see how durable the cover is but initial impressions are good.EDIT-sending in for a replacement... A seam has split. I also had a puddle on my side table (opposite side of the split seam). Will re-edit review when I get the replacement.
5,Perfect,"The measurements were exact, and it fits over my grill perfectly. I have never had a cover before but decided that I needed my higher priced grill covered in the winter. Its well made, very heavy duty and price was fantastic! Highly recommend this item."
5,Heavy Duty Cover,This is much nicer and stronger than the covers available locally. It fits well and wall delivered promptly as is the usual case with Amazon.
2,seams rip,"I purchased May,27,2012 the XL pebble BBQ cover. The top seam has already ripped . all of the materials except the stitching are in good shape"
2,Hype,I live in sunny California and this thing was rotted and tearing within the 1st year. I expected better. Looks nice but the material is weaker than it looks.
5,Great alternative to the Weber cover,I have a Genesis E-310 I bought April '08 and I was looking for a good cover. After hearing about and seeing that the Weber cover had vents on the top I was looking for an alternative. Luckily I found this one. It's heavy duty and fits perfectly. The zipper pockets are a nice touch as well as the two handles on top to help with positioning the cover. I feel much better about leaving my grill outside now.
5,"Excellent choice, excellent value","This was purchased online after several months of searching the stores for a quality cover. The ones in the store at this price do not compare. The cover fits beautifully, is pretty to look at and is strong enough to last many many years. I am so happy I didn't settle for one in the store, those all paled in comparison!"
4,Nice cover,Nice and heavy duty. Has a nice canvas feel and is still flexible in really cold weather. I recommend this and may even purchase other furniture covers from this manufacture.
4,"Veranda Cart Barbecue Cover, Medium, Pebble, up to 58-inches Wide",I like all the features except one and the price is good. I wonder if the price was lowered as these are seconds. The advertised pockets are sewn upside down on my cover. They are not usable.
4,Good Solid Cover,"The cover works wellPros: Nice solid coverwidth and depth fit the grill wellappearance is goodCons: the cover does not reach the ground, It is about 5"" short. My goal was a ground length cover.I recommend to order one size larger cover"
4,grill cover - great initial impression,"Just purchased a Weber Genesis E-330. This grill cover looks and fits great on it. Giving it only 4 stars since I've not owned it long enough to report on its durability. Initially, I bought the large size then bought a medium, which fits better. Even with the rotisserie bracket attached, there's still plenty of room. I kept the large and am using it instead for our old 5 burner Kenmore grill. I think these covers will wear much better than the Kenmore cover which began to crack and leak after one year."
5,Excellent cover,great product for the price. Very heavy. I defintely won't have to worry about the wind blowing this off the grill. Wish they made a smoker cover also.
5,Best Grill Cover Ever,"Okay, I can't really vouch for the fact that there has never been a better cover. However, it's the best one I've ever had.It has been outside year-round here on Long Island, near open water. It has held up extremely well. The squirrels or feral cats or birds that made multiple holes in my previous plastic cover, perhaps to get at the padding for nest material, have been unable to damage this one at all. It is heavy, but that's not a negative: I mention it only to establish how substantial it is. The handles on top are a very nice touch.I agree with those who said finding the right size is tricky, but it's well worth the effort. I recommend this without qualification."
5,Excellent cover for Weber grill,Very pleased with this cover. Easy on and off as it is flexible even in cold weather. We live in New England and use our grill year round - this cover makes putting the cover on and off much easier.
3,Heavy Duty Cover but Fading!,"I was impressed with the cover when I received it about a month ago. It is constructed of a very heavy material and fit my grill. I have just noticed although, that the side that faces the sun has slightly faded which is a concern after only a month! I checked the warranty card that came with the cover and fading is not mentioned!"
4,barbecue cover,i have a Weber silver BBQ this cover fits great. it has 4 straps and 2 tension ropes to keep it secure.it is a lot heavier than the regular black plastic covers and has past the wind test in my back yard.do not hesitate to purchase any products from this company
4,"Good value, well made",Cover was really better than expected. Size and color was correct. Seems that it is well made with good quality materials. Would have given five stars but haven't had it long enough to rate its durability.
5,heavy cover,"got this cover few days after i bought it,has some weight to it ,made of canvus ,i bought a size bigger for a weber grill i have ,live by the beach so wind and sun among other elements ruin grill covers in less than 6 months has a draw string at bottom and snap its for the legs ,has a 3 year warranty .im really happy with this purchase and the price was good too"
5,Better Quality Than I thought!,This is really unbelievable quality! HEAVY material! It does not fit the grill perfectly but unless you get a cover actually designed for your grill this will probably be the case. It WILL NOT blow off..and YOU will not be disappointed!
3,okay,Cover is made well but very heavy. Ties on cover that are made to go around legs of grill are difficult to use.
5,"Great product, looks exactly like the photo and fits grill perfectly!",I have a Charbroil combination gas and charcoal grill and I was extremely worried that this cover would not fit. But everything about it works. I very happy with my purchase.
5,Good Outdoor Grill Cover,"I replaced my original Weber cover after it became stiff and hard to put on and take off. This one, so far, goes on and off easily and covers the whole grill top to bottom, and looks much nicer than the original black plastic-looking one. It has already survived one wind storm with no problem"
5,Grill cover,"great material, very durable fabric, not the plastic kind. This cover should last years. I'm very satisfied. One thing to note, my grill measured 52"" across, but I bought the large which was stated as 64"" across, it fits perfectly, so you might think about buy one size up when purchasing."
3,"Looks durable, but lasted only 2 years","I totally loved this cover after I purchased it in 2009, until I recently found out that the fabric on its top is worn out and had a big hole there. It doesn't appear to be torn, but rather ""thinned out"" under the elements."
1,Small book- hardly any pictures.,The ad for this book makes one thinks that this book is jammed packed with big pictures. Capture the scene of college football. Joke.The book is small in height and width. Its like a paperback novel. Only 30 pictures- which are only stadium shots in second rate black and white reproduction.
5,Great Book on Global Banking,"A great book. Exciting to read, clearly written and full of practical insights into global banking. Discusses tenable strategies for financial firms world-wide and contains insights that are difficult to find anywhere else. The authors taught a course based on this book at INSEAD and the book retains the liveliness and rigor of that excellent course.A must buy for anyone connected with or interested in the structure and strategies of global finance firms."
3,Disappointing,"Set on a New England college campus, part of the story concerns the in-fighting and college politics within its English department; another is a love story between a new professor (Henry) and Lizzie, who is haunted by a terrible dark secret involving her child born out of wedlock. Brace's talent as a writer is evident on every page, but the story is dull and not at all captivating. Much better is Brace's novel THE GARRETSON CHRONICLE."
4,Mysterious Fun,Kiki is ditzy but lovable. Her sister Hannah is brains and common sense. Together they put fun into mystery that creates a wonderful diversion.
3,review from the Synthesis,"Aqualung's first US album release showcases singer/songwriter Matt Hales' knack for ballad writing. Hales' haunting vocals and woeful pianos, along with strings, percussion and the occasional flourish of guitar here, or organ there, all join together, making for a poignant album. Strange and Beautiful could stand to gain some speed, for even though Aqualung's songs are moving, they fail to provide the momentum needed to give each track some necessary variation. The closest the album comes to being upbeat is the track ""Left Behind,"" which has a very familiar Coldplay-esque ring to it. So if you need a truly outstanding album, then honestly this won't do. But, if you need a change of pace (specifically, a low key one) this could be the ticket.- Robin BaciorSynthesis.net"
3,"Not ""Brighter Than Sunshine"" - Coldplay on Thorazine","I bought the CD because I had heard and liked the track ""Brighter Than Sunshine."" Unfortunately, there are no other songs on the CD that have the same tempo; everything is so slow that it sounds like whining. Not for me."
2,... higher expectations (?),"Well, I originally heard this song on MTV, and then I heard 'Brighter Than Sunshine' in the film 'Just Like Love'. After I saw the appearing everywhere, and seeing VH1 talk about Aqualung, I figuired that it was going to be great. So, I decided to purchase it. I guess I expected to hear more songs like 'Just Like Love', but most of the songs were sung in his high pitch head voice, and really slowly. 'Just Like Love' is about as upbeat as it gets. Not to mention, 90% of the songs are written about a depressing love experience. But, I'm sure, just like all of my other albums, it will grow on me, and I'll likely wind up liking it the most. Just don't expect so much from this album like I did."
4,LOVE KILLS BY DANGREENBURG,"I TO READ THIS BOOK SOME TIME AGO. IT WAS A PAGE TURNER, UNBELIEVABLE SUSPENSE.READ IN TWO DAYS,AFRAID TO THROW OUT MY GARBAGE!"
3,Sort Of Helpful,This Book Is Helpful Becouse it shhows you how to win every battle. which is kind of bad becous than youdont have to think. Thats the bad part the good part is it it shows you how to do almost every super move. All and all this is a fairly good product.
3,Ferrero Raffaello Coconut candies,"I love all, Ferrero Raffaello candies but this Coconut kind .... Feel it wasn't really FRESH!!!!!!! I had from the store OH MY GOD melts in your mouth but wasn't the same. I'll just buy from the store in the future now on."
4,Very enjoyable CD!,"This CD, in my opinion contains 5 really outstanding tracks. The singles ""Satelite"", and ""Ease the Pressure"" are both great upbeat tracks. My favorite track however, is ""Deliver Me"", which was meant by the band to be the second single. It is very simple and very beautiful. ""Missing You"" and ""For Your Love"" are both great tracks with cool beats. The other tracks don't have quite the same effect on me, but they are each interesting in their own way, and altogether this is a very good album. I would say that I do like ""Conscience"" even better, however. I can't wait for them to someday finish their next album."
2,The love/ hate movie,"I gotta tell you, my sister and I both love Dreyfuss and Irving and Lee Remick. The best part of this movie is the piano competition. The actors were beliveable in their ""playing"" the piano. Eveything thing else stunk in this movie. It is a guilty pleasure movie. This is possibly the worst acting from an entire cast in a single movie. Lee Remick walks around in robotic motion and needs a beat down for the insults. Dreyfuss' parents should have thrown him out from the basement years ago for over-acting more than usual. Sam Wanamaker and his sweater on the shoulders, joint smoking, getting his mack on to weird music was just what we needed to push us over the edge into uncontrollable laughter. I rent this movie when I need a good laugh and it suits the bill. I am sure that wasn't the intention when it was made. Did I mention about Dreyfuss crying after having sex and that silly cap? Now I need to watch the movie again!"
4,No need to read in between the lines.,"Having been associated with a couple of the people who were in this film - one as a pianist - and having been in competitions like this back at that time - although now as a ragtime player, I have one pressing comment.DVD DVD Blu-Ray DVD DVD DVD, DVD DVD DVD - DVD DVD DVD DVD DVD.

5,Very solid film,"The music is beautiful and the array of characters is first rate. This was also Lee Remick, god rest her soul, at her very best, IMHO."
3,A gift,This was a Christmas gift for my brother a few yeas back. I have seen a couple sketches. The actor is funny.
5,It's Only Money!!!,"I contemplated buying this set due to the hefty price. But hey, how much is it worth to you to relive all those hilarious memories over & over again! I just watched the parrot sketch with my 11 year old daughter (I'm now pushin' Rolling Stone age) and we had a great laugh together. Plus, if you first saw these shows in your early teens, like I did, you'll pick up on a lot more of the subtle & adult humor presented here; humor you may have missed the first time around. So......you can't take it with you so you might as well spend it wisely. Buy this set and I guarantee you will not regret your decision. Add to cart and don't look back!"
5,european humor not for europeans,"believe it or not, this masterpiece of european (actually british) humor is not available in good ole europe. Unfortunaly is there in europe a different DVD country code, so it is useless to purchase this DVD set unless your DVD device can switch to different codes.So anyone who is able to watch MPFC is a real lucky person because it is a real privilege to do so. And more then everything else it is the best comedy in the world. I've watched the series from a recorded video tape so often that in the end the tapes grew thin and teared apart.And for me it was the start of learning English in a very very very funny way"
2,Not quite as talented as some think are the Pythons,None of them can sing well. None of them can dance well (cept for Chapman--a little). The shows are funny but in a lot of ways childish too. Not quite as great as made out to be.
5,Monty Python Amazing Laughs,"I have been a huge Monty Python fan since i was a little kid. I remember Monty Python coming on TV on fox 29 back in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I still love the dead parrot sketch as one of my all-time favourites along with Twit of the year or lumberjack or nudge nudge wink wink, etc. I strongly recommend this set to anyone that is monty python fan!!"
4,Almost Complete Monty Python,"Contrary to what the title of this set suggests, this is not the complete Monty Python's Flying Circus. One cut has been made: in episode 38 the opening sketch ""Party Political Broadcast (Choreographed)"" and the closing trailers ""Dad's Doctor"" and ""Dad's Pooves"" have been cut... TWO cuts have been made: in episode 38 the opening sketch ""Party Political Broadcast (Choreographed)"" and the closing trailers ""Dad's Doctor"" and ""Dad's Pooves"" have been cut, as well as a line in episode 33's ""Biggles Dictates A Letter""... THREE cuts have been made... Actually more than three.On the plus side, some of the DVDs contain sketches from the rarely seen German episodes as bonus material, so I give this set three sta.., er, FOUR stars..."
5,Complete Monty Python Series,"What can one say about the opportunity to affordably purchase such an iconic, classic show as ""Monty Python's Flying Circus""? It was such a great price, I HAD to have it. If you like ""the Pythons"", you MUST add this to your collection. A true classic in every way."
1,Fatima lost in memories,"We know now that we have two Fatimas: one, represented truly by the original documents and official inquiries between 1917 and 1923 and other that the late (1941) Lucia's Memoires identify.The firts one has historical value and we can assume as a goodsource of information; the other, is only a matter of faith, a product gradually constructed along the decades by the Seer within her monastery life ans their teachers and theological guides. This is the true that has little importance when anyone makes the world identical to one's desires and imagination."
5,Great movie,"I purchased this as a gift from my husband. He had Alone in the Wildreness and had been asking for this one since reading the books of Dick Proenneke. He loves the movies and they are great for those evenings when NOTHING is on TV. Even I don't tire from watching them, nor do the kids."
5,Flight Plan - Gotta See - Keep watching,"My roommate and I are Jodi Foster fans. We thought we were going to be disappointed at first, but her dynamic performance kept us fascinated and we were not disappointed. We would highly recommend this movie to all our friends. Makes you believe in a persons sense of right. No disappointments here."
2,Whole Lotta Bad Acting,"I usually like Jodi Foster but her performance here is over the top, and the rest of the performances are just plain bad. The story itself is formulaic. I was disappointed."
4,Stylish thriller,"Stylish thriller, but just a bit predictable. Overall good film, with some fine performances, just a bit of a stretch on the plausibility scale."
5,Unpredictable,"This movie deserves 5 stars on how unpredictable the ending was alone! finally, a movie I couldnt predict..I have been waiting a long time for this....Her daughter shows up missing, she frantically looks for her. In her quest to find her, there are some crazy findings that I dont want to spoil..But to give advice, this movie is well acted and has a serious and mysterious feeling you get, and it makes the movie all the more enjoyableI can't spoil it! sorry :-)"
2,"At 36,000 feet you can't just walk out of the theatre.","If this was the film that was playing, I think I would give that walk a go. This has to be the worst film that Jodie Foster has ever done, and not because her acting was poor. On the contrary, she was fine for the role; however, the writing and plot were terribly formulaic. From the second of the aforementioned quote it was evident to see where the film was headed, and it did not derail from the predestined outcome. While the premise was frightening, the thriller aspect of this film just did not convey. In fact, it came across flat out hokey in several spots. I adore both Foster and Sarsgaard, but how many times has she played a victimized overprotective mother, exactly? Often enough that she should have it down by now--and she does. Sarsgaard, though, seemed bored with his lines, all but delivering them between yawns. The only real star in this film was the six year old daughter, played by Marlene Lawston. Too bad she had so little time."
2,Too good to be true and it was!,"The first part of the movie was well done. Was her daughter with her or was it just the thought of her daughter that overcame her? I began to have doubts, as the flashbacks appeared on the screen, and with the growing certainty of the passengers and crew that they never saw her on the plane. I thought of Hitchcock's THE LADY VANISHES, where the gentle older woman disappears as her newly made friend takes a nap on a train.But then everything changed. The movie was too good to be true, and it degenerated into a standard, nonsensical thriller, with Arabs, with hints of hijacking, with threats of a remote controlled bomb, with ransom demands, with guns, and with an intricate murder plot.It is always a pleasure to see Jodie Foster, and to see the quality of her acting. But she just couldn't save this movie."
4,reasonable thriler movie that could have led nowhere,"This movie sounds like a pretty cheesy concept. A 6 year old girl on a plane gets lost. But add in a dead husband, a very fatigued and frantic mother who is an airplane engineer, and possibly a very great terrorist plot, with a decent ending, then you get this movie. Jodie foster plays a mother traveling home from berlin to long island with her 6 year old daughter after her husband falls in a mysterious accident. Foster falls asleep for 2 hours and then poof, the little girl is gone, lost on a plane over the mid atlantic. however, no one seems to remember the litte girl, so it's off to the races to find her. This is definately worth checking out once or twice."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"For a while the suspense builds effectively, but the premise is so far-fetched that it collapses. Isn't there an easier way for the bad guys to do what they want?"
2,"GOOD THRILLER,BUT NOT THIS DVD RELEASE!!!!!!","2 stars for DVD release, BUT 4 star for movie!!This movie hit number ONE in box office for 2 weeks in row!. I liked the movie was tense, and twisted, good thriller ride, And of course loves ""Jodie foster"" in it, I am DVD collector, and after I saw the movie in theater, I said to myself I am going to buy this movie for my collection...but after 2 weeks number one in box office came out bare bone DVD. Not double disk or extended cut or anything to makes u happy to buy this DVD. So means I am very sure after while they going to another release DVD down the road like ""special edition double disk"" or extended cut ...So if u DVD collector like me, then wait till u get the real thing. This is just B.S and they want to suck up more money from us like most others DVDS releases these days!!. If u want see it just rent for now! ""DO NOT BUY THIS DVD VERSION"" better be safe then sorry!"
3,Pretty good suspense movie,"This is a good movie, with lot's of suspense. But I'll tell you if I was one of the extra passengers on the plane I would have had a heart attack. Jodie Foster as usual does a good job, in this she's playing a mother on a plane who's daughter ""disapears"" and no one believes the girl was ever even on the plane. I'm not going to ruin it but I was questioning what was going on throughout the whole film (i;e where's the daughter, who's good, who's bad, is Foster nuts?) Peter Sarsgaard costars as an air marshal and he's a great actor and holds his own against Foster. Overall I'd tell someone to rent it."
2,I'd like to give it more stars...,"..but I just can't. I'm a Jodie Foster fan for the most part (did anyone besides me notice her frightening resemblance to Michael Jackson in this film?) However, her success with ""Panic Room,"" which was a better film all around, seems to have spawned this thriller. Sadly, this one is full of way too many plot holes to take it seriously. Foster is a strong actress as always, but her abilities can't keep this flight up in the air. It's contrived, unbelievable and, though it has a nice set up, it's ultimately a huge let down."
2,Change your Flightplans,"The characters are practically all uninteresting. The plot is so tired. The ''best'' part of the movie is Foster merely opening a bathroom vent and then having access to all vital plane wiring. Yeah, that's going to happen. If it did all our planes would have crashed by now. Nothing about this movie rings even close to being true-to-life; avoid. Is this movie TRULY $30?! HA! Glad I borrowed it..."
3,FlightPlan,The only reason i watched this movie was to find outwhat happened to the womans child. The first half of the movie was very confusing cause all these different things happens and you dont know why it happened. But like before the movie we all make prerdictions on if the woman was crazy or if she really lost her child. In the first half of the movie it leans toward one side of the choice and then it makes a big turn around. i will not say wat it is or what happened you will have to watch the movie yourself. My overall rating of the movie is 3 outta 5 popcorn kernels. The movie just keeps you guessing.
5,Great thriller,"This is a great thriller without the blood. Heavy on suspense, and it was no surprise that Foster's acting was outstanding. Her ability to have just the right voice and facial tension adds to the dramatic feeling. Perfect for action/suspense lovers. I also liked the twist on the new style of plane, though it did make a point that by getting bigger, we only increase the inability to pay attention to people.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,"Flightplan - some turbulence, but it stays aloft","My problem going into Flightplan was that the trailer, like many other recent movies, gave away much of the story. As seen in most of the advertisements, Jodie Foster plays a woman who loses her daughter in the middle of a trans-Atlantic flight. Her family has suffered a great deal previous to this, and the circumstances of what has transpired are shrouded in mystery.Without giving away any of the remaining surprises, let me just say that there is some decent entertainment to be found here. Jodie Foster, Peter Saarsgard, and Sean Bean (often typecast as a villain) all give strong performances, working from a script that is sometimes thoughtful but ultimately has no bite. As a result, the pacing is noticeably uneven. As the plot unfolded, I found myself wishing that the overall film had more bite to it. Nothing has the impact that it should.On the whole, I recommend saving this one for a rental. Final grade: B-"
2,Freeze 24/7 moisturizer,"I honestly didn't notice anything about this product that would make it worth over 60.00. infact, had i to do it over again, i would not pay over 5 or 10 dollars to give it a try. It did absolutely nothing for me excect cost me way to much.I had heard about it on the ""early show"" or ""Good morning America"". They said it was such a great product and since i love products like ""NARS"" and Smashbox, i thought i would give this a try.I got better moisture from Nivea. No kidding, i couldn't believe it. Do not waste your money. i tried it every which way and no results at all."
2,Missing GOR's Best Music,"Alt.country meets the Replacements. My favorite on this disc is 16 Ways, so give it a listen if you are thinking of buying.As this collection omits the tracks from the indie release of ""No Free Lunch"" which is the band's best work, it is misnamed. If you are curious about Green on Red, start with ""No Free Lunch""."
3,Not interesting,"This book that I'm reading is Tell me this isn't happening. This is a book that different kids from all over the world is telling there true stories about their embarrassing moments. I really don't like this book.Because it wasn't that funny or embarrassing.It is a short book and there was no point in this book.It wasn't even that funny.The funny one in this book is when Tasha's top canned off and eveyone saw her chest.Not unless you think falling in the toilet is funny other than that. You shouldn't read this book.Because it's a dum book, but if you like to read it than you should but I wouldn't if I were you."
3,"Good, but could be better.","I bought the CD for ""I Believe I Can Fly"" and ""For You I Will,"" which are the best songs on the entire album. Many of the songs are out of place on such an album, like Coolio, Salt N' Pepa, and Jay-Z w/Changing Faces. The subject matter in those songs is inappropriate for the movie."
4,Welcome to the Space Jam,"Happy New Year to everyone! This review is for the score in the film, not the soundtrack with the songs. James Newton Howard scores this film much in the style of the old Warner Bros. cartoon composers, like the great Carl Stalling. The music is mickey-moused to fit to every single, tiny movement that is on screen. This is not to say that all of the music is like this because it isn't. Some of the music is scored in a rhythm band like fashion with guitars and drums. There is some thematic material that can be found throughout the score for both good and evil. The theme for the good guys is a heroic brassy 7 note motif that can be heard everytime one of the good guys does something heroic. The theme for the bad guys is a comedic like rhythm section motif that is perfect for a Warner Bros. cartoon. The majority of the rest of the music is mainly old- fashioned cartoonish style music, with some full orchestral blasts here and there. An enjoyable score all around."
4,Good result,It seems to make our Grandson happy when he got it............it was a birthday present.............so I guess we are good.
4,Great insight into America,"In the 90's, HBO used to spit out one crappy 'Original Movie' seemingly weekly. This one had some known stars in it, and a interesting plot line. Hell, James Earl Jones as a narrator, Denis Leary basically playing himself and Phil Hartman Bush-Dimwitted President and you can't go wrong. It would be a great movie to show a middle or high school social studies class since it mixes humor, real life and one of American's biggest issues, immigration, all in one."
1,(1-1/2 stars) People LIKE this?,"I bought this album back in '97 because I was into Mark's song ""Return Of The Mack"". But other than that song, the rest of the album isn't worth your while. Simply put, this album is terrible. The songs are very poorly written, and most of them are either about sex (""Moan And Groan"", ""Horny"") or getting high (""Get High With Me"").There are twelve songs on the album, and two of them are tired remixes of his first two singles (""Return Of The Mack"" and ""Crazy""). Speaking of ""Crazy"", that's what you have to be if you want to spend your money on this. If you own it, deposit it in the nearest trash compactor."
3,"Classic for its day, still relevant today.","Return of the Mack is classic, the rest of the album is just ok, doesn't match the verve of the namesake."
5,Went through the wash,"Great camera. Easy to use, easy to retrieve pictures (no software needed! just drag and drop), and very compact.So compact that I left it in my pocket and it went through the washer and dryer... doesn't work anymore (though I suspect its only the battery).oh, btw: Battery life is lacking."
5,"You pay more, you get more.","Yes, I had to spend some money, but it is money well worth it. This camera works well in several situations such as dusk pictures, as well as moving pictures. I would definitely recommend getting the 256 MB memory chip because the one that comes with it which is 16 MB can only take about 15 pictures and the memory card is full. If you also ever want to use the video function, you will definitely need more memory.Fantastic!"
4,Camera's great/software stinks,"After using a klunky old Kodak 2.0 for the last 2 years, I am awed by the DimageXi...I mastered its use quickly. It feels solid, performs great and I'm already trying some of the more arcane features...The software is either unusable on Macs or the manual that describes its use is unreadable. Otherwise, the camera would get five stars. I'm online now to research what I need to make editting and storage easy. for the moment the best i can do is load the Jpegs into an Appleworks document and print from there.One last thing, watch out for the left thumb that keeps creeping into the bottom of the photo."
5,A really good Book!,This book is really good. It is full of adventure and loads of fun. Amanda and David go through a lot of cool adventures. You should really read this book.
3,"Good, but tough read","I don't like ""Teckla""; i can't imagine witnessing anyone's relationship selfdestruct could be considered a pleasant activity. So, i don't like it -- but i do respect it. It is a well-written book, and it is important as far as setting the stage for the rest of the series. ""Teckla"" and ""Phoenix"" should be read in succession for best effect."
1,Confusing!,"Unfortunately, I had to read some chapters of this book for an exam. I thought that would be no big deal, as I was familiar with the basics of Game Theory. But this book makes the impossible possible: After reading it, I had the feeling I know less than before! I was seriously confused!The writing style is neither intuitive nor mathematical, it is ... just too hard to understand what Mr Osborne wants to say. Don't read! Don't buy!"
5,Great rattle for your little monkey!,I loved this rattle the minute I saw it. It's made very well & safe for baby as are all of the toys from the Melissa & Doug line. My 7 month old loves to stare at the colorful monkey and he laughs when the monkey's eyes move around. It's just a simple yet adorable rattle with the cutest monkey face you've ever seen. My son loves it and so does anyone else who sees it & asks me where I got it.
3,whatever,owed my wife a movie so she requested this one..that's why i bought it.unrealistic movie however.Bruce Willis always makes fin movies.
4,Well done,"Retirement is boring, espcecially for ex Black Ops CIA operatives. Morgan Freeman gives a wonderful performance, as he always does. He is ultimately one of the best actors in the biz. Without spoiling it, I will just say you will enjoy it."
3,Great Actors: horrible acting,"even though this movie has some amazing actors, they did a mediocre job at best... not worth seeingquality was pretty good"
3,Not what I expected,There were great reviews on this movie and that's why I purchased it. After viewing the movie I was disappointed. In my opinion I'd rent it before I purchased it.
5,One of the Best Movies Ever,"""Red"" is an amazing action-packed movie that has some very hilarious scenes. I've watched this movie three times already, and I could watch it three more. The Access:Red feature is really neat and fun to watch the movie with. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes movies."
3,Over the top action violence but entertaining overall,"The action violence seems overdone to me in this film, with thousands of bullets being fired, several explosions, and so on. However, it is worth watching for the sheer entertainment value, and the casting is great--especially of John Malkovich as an operative who is just chock-full of nutty goodness and some justified paranoia.It is really wild to see Helen Mirren gunning people down and wearing combat boots with a formal gown!"
5,great flick,"With Prime delivery, ""Red"" arrived in two days, and in perfect condition. An excellent addition to our ever growing Blu-ray movie collection. Recommend for any fans of action movies with sassy characters."
1,No HD Audio Track,"Do not buy this movie. Putting out a Blu-ray version without an HD audio track, or even Dolby Plus, is just a cheap money grab."
5,Great one-liners...,"I just ordered this movie last month. We've watched it at least 3 times. I have just been reading the other reviews and they have solidified for me something that is so hard to put into words. This move is a comedy/adventure/romance, and does all three well. We do not like slap-stick so rarely touch anything with comedy in any way related but this was a fun movie and you had to listen to pick up the good lines. Anyone just wanting a fun relaxing time will enjoy it."
4,Fun and funny!,My son and daughter-in-law wanted me to see this so badly when I went to visit that they paid to see it again in a theater while I was there.This movie was so enjoyable and humorous that I looked forward to seeing the Expendables 2 movie when it came out last year which features similar aging action stars in interesting plots with lots of action and explosions!
5,Great all around,"The movie was great, and the service from the seller almost as good. Really, this is almost a must-see for any senior citizen who has a liking for action movies."
4,RED,"I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE I LIKED IT BUT I DIDN'T LOVE IT, IT WAS ALSO A LITTLE SLOW IN SOME SPOTS. RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE BRUCE WILLIS."
1,no good,"i purchased red before christmas for christmas present but found out it was not going to be delivered till janaury so spoke to advisor online asking if this was correct and they confirmed yes so when i said it would be to late they knocked 50 pecent off which was good and i also received it before christmas afterwards which was good .i give it to my nephew for christmas and then i found out it was the wrong region and would not play in uk ,so i was not happy the advisor i spoke to did not make this clear to me ,they of just mentioned it seeing that it was going to uk address"
2,Misses the mark,Could have been good as the script was reasonable.The Director could'nt seem to make up his mind if it should be a comedy or a thriller and ended up being neither.Bruce Willis needs a hit movie soon or his star will be waning.
1,"No HD audio, no sale","Bought this on pre-order, assuming that a new release disc with HD video would have HD audio, just like every other BRD I have ever bought has, well the studio tried to pull a fast one, I assume to push people toward the more expensive SE disc, well I don't want all the extra cr*p, just HD audio and HD video, now they will get none of my $ and Amazon will pay for a return. Hopefully this deceitful tactic doesn't become the norm."
1,No HD Audio for Movie Only Edition Blu Ray,"This review is for the movie only blu ray edition. I am giving it a one star rating because the movie only edition shortchanges the consumer. As indicated in some of the prior reviews, this edition only comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. It does not come with any High Definition audio tracks. Most blu ray movies typically have at least one HD audio track whether its TrueDolbyHD or DTS-Master Audio so the average consumer may not be aware of this deficiency because they've come to expect High Def audio as the norm for Blu Ray movies. If you want the DTS-MA audio track you need to pony up some extra money to get the more expensive special edition. This is important to know for anyone who has a decent home theater set up with high definition audio and want the best sound possible."
3,A Lot of Action and a Few Laughs,"We got this on a hunch and watched it this afternoon. The movie is filled with action and has some funny, even silly scenes that got several laughs from me. The seasoned cast seems to be having fun with the movie as well and offers the viewer some interesting situations with predictable results.This one was good once but we will probably not watch it again. The ending of the movie is rather contrived and designed to leave the audience laughing, I didn't. The sound and video were both very good."
2,not good on power,This gun not to powerful. bb's jammed and battery only last about 1 hour for play. I returned this gun and bought a M14 much happier.thanksDouble Eagle M82 Fully Automatic AEG Airsoft Electric Gun Fully Loaded
5,Awesome!!!!!,"My son has quite a few air soft guns (that he uses for props in his films) & this was, by far, his favorite!!! Thank you!!"
5,I Love This Thing!,"For the price I paid, I'm very happy with this little guy. I like to fire off a few shots in the backyard whenever I'm bored or I feel like impressing some ladies. Sometimes, if I really feel like impressing the honeys, I'll go full auto like BLAT BLAT BLAT BLAT BLAT. Needless to say, LADIES LOVE THIS THING, and that's good enough for me."
3,"Good,but took to long to ship!","This airsoft gun is a good gun for beginners, but it has horrible FPS and it took about a week to arrive, and it wasn't very far away to start with. i would recommend this gun to beginners but i wouldn't if you want a fast gun, this is is slow not kinda fast, SLOW. My friends can step about of the way pretty much. So if this is your first gun it is good for you, but if you are advanced or even a moderate airsofter don't buy this gun."
1,Waste of Money,"If your looking for some tips on how to sell books on e-bay or some other internet auction site, this book has nothing at all to offer. It's nothing more than a series of common sense bromides (pack the books well and be nice!), and poorly written at that."
5,Wonderful Book,This is a wonderful book that allows the reader to really visualize what it would be like to be an honored guest in Jefferson's Home for dinner. Very informative.
2,Vilppu sketching on location manual by Glenn V Vilppu,Content of book was different than what I expected.
4,Talking Mr Incredible,"I bought this to go with my son's set of Incredibles without realizing that it was 3 times larger than the action figures, but my son loved it anyway. The way it talks is unusual. It speaks and moves it's mouth only when you push the button, so you can make him say only one word at a time instead of a whole phrase."
5,changed my life,"I can't believe I have waited most of my life to read this book. It has changed my perspective on my marriage, my job and the way I'm raising my child."
5,This book is a must-have for abuse victims,"This book helped me to see my situation for what it was--and really opened my eyes. The abuse I was experiencing began as verbal/emotional and escalated into physical. The book was loaned to me by a friend and I cannot put into words how much it helped to read the scenarios that seemed to be exactly what I was going through. Beverly Engel offered step by step help, first explaining the situations, how to identify my role, and how to deal with it. Taking her advice to heart, I am happy to report that I was able to safely leave my abusive relationship and have gone on to help others in the same situation. The book is helpful for all types of abuse, not just emotional. The book is also wonderful to use in conjuction with therapy. Thank you Beverly for being there!!!"
5,My all time favorite,I read this as child and was always haunted with the images and the stories. i found my self in love with the authors books. This one is so wonderful. Has lots of pictures and cute story. I would recommend this to everyone!
5,One Monster After Another,"This is a charming children's book, both in word and illustration. It is unfortunate that it is out of print, but if you can find a copy, grab on to it----it's a Keeper and a Classic. They don't write them like this anymore, except for Mr. Mayer. A GEM"
3,Joe Haschka is right on,"I finished Wanderlust yesterday, and in reading Joe Haschka's review, he picked out both my favorite essays in this collection and the ones I found insufferable. There were several essays I thought were very good, and several that I wondered why they made it into the collection. I also didn't finish the essay on Africa travel writing-it read more like a second-grade college paper than a travel essay."
4,Fun collection,"I quite enjoy travel stories, and this collection is a fun read. I dipped in now and then. Some of the stories are sublime, while others are just so-so. Well worth a read though."
2,BEWARE BUYERS!!,"Beware, H/K makes great recievers/amplifiers, and horrible CD players. My FL8370 has given me problems from the start. The first one I recieved failed to advance CD's after the previous CD finished, it would randomly skip (on Cd's right out of the package), sometimes it would fail to read a CD at all. After returning it for a replacement, I found the new one has it's quirks as well. Although not as frequent, occasionally the new unit fails to advance CD's. I expected a $300 CD player to work at least as well as my cheaper Kenwood player. Don't be fooled into the assumption that just because the unit has a H/K label on it, it is of high quality. My H/K player is a $300 chunk of junk. Do your homework before you buy."
3,Second Best,"Bill Tilman was indeed the 'Last Hero'. His exploits are absolutely unbelievable. From being wounded twice in the first world war, to a coffee planter in kenya, to cycling across africa in the 1930s, climbing Kilimanjaro, Mt Kenya and the Ruwenzori, the first ascent of Nanda Devi in 1936, reaching 27,200 on Everest without oxygen 1938 (many with Eric Shipton), fighting behind enemy lines in Italy and Albania in the second world war, finally sailing to such remote regions including Greenland and Spitsbergen. Unfortunately this biography does not match the orginal 'High Mountains and Cold Seas' by J. Anderson which is now out of print. Tilman was a great author with a great sense of humour. His 7 mountain and 7 sailing books rate as possibly the best travel/adventure books ever. However, if this is the only book on Tilman you can get hold of, it is still worth the read."
5,A fascinating account of a fictional WWII RAF bombing raid,"Len Deighton has written a fascinating novel of a tragically bungled (fictional) night bombing raid by the RAF in 1943. The book is full of information about the men and machines which took part on both sides. Readers knowledgeable about the air war will appreciate the technical details which Deighton lavishly provides but the casual reader will also be caught up by his talented storytelling. Folly piles upon folly in revealing the tragic and often unintended ramifications of making war.The ironic tone which suffuses the novel is reflected in the subtitle. As the author points out in the disclaimer, there was no June 31st in 1943 or any other year. A book to read and reread."
3,Reads like a chocolate catalogue at times,"Too much shop-reviewing! I don't need to read so many reviews of shops I am unlikely to ever be able to visit. The book was great and had a good amount of information, but the shop reviews went on forever. Nice recipes in the back, but I am unlikely to actually make them."
3,Was this book edited?,"In the beginning of this book, it says Lacy's birthday is May 4th, 1975 (the day before mine), but when the author talks about Laci's memorial service on April 27th, 2003, he says Laci would have turned 28 that day. A caption of one of the photos says the same thing.When the author first mentions Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly was kidnapped and murdered, he says it happened in 1993. Near the end of the book, he says Richard Davis kidnapped her in 1983. I was BORN in 1983! The incorrect year appears twice in that paragraph.This book is full of interesting tidbits about the case, but some readers will still catch onto incorrect information such as dates and years. It makes me wonder if the author included other incorrect information in his book. I can't wait until the trial is over and better authors write better books with all the grisly details we didn't have access to during the investigation and the trial."
2,"Pretty, but feels cheap","I chose 2 stars for my rating because I bought this to give to my sister as a gift and unfortunately it just feels too cheap to give it to her. I put it on myself and it is pretty - would be good for someone who likes bigger proportions/sizes in their jewelry (not particularly delicate). And I would recommend it to you if you think it is pretty, you need a silver every day kind of necklace and you are going to be wearing it yourself. Unfortunately, as a gift, it just comes across as a cheap necklace - when you hold it in your hand the medallion and the chain make a tin-like sound against each other and the under-side of the medallion is hollow and not smooth. Again, it is pretty when it is on and the quality can be kept as your little secret if you don't mind."
5,Better than I expected,I ordered this for my 11 yr old daughter for Xmas. It was prettier and bigger than I expected (even though I read the size specs). For the price I think it's a perfect gift.
2,"Pay a little more, and get something better.","Pros: Cheap. The poles are more durable than they look.Cons: It's a pain to set up, and golf balls will occasionally fly right through, even though I'm a beginner with a slow swing speed."
2,Totally Terrible,"Terrible cliche outer space invasion written in 1960's pulp style. Jim the astronaut is the hero, and his damsel is the deferring Dottie. Not only is the writing bad, the science is plain wrong. Jim has developed psychic powers from being in space, and they are just the thing to combat this weird alien invasion of Cosmozoids lead by an evil Cosmopath. Alien goo and mind control play big roles. Parts were so bad I laughed, but overall I disliked the book and can't recommend it."
4,Long but interesting...,"I was on a flight over the U.S. a few weeks ago and the man sitting next to me looked at the book I was reading (this one) and spitted out to me, ""I have to tell you, that book is a fraud."" He then went on to say that ""they"" (whomever ""they"" are I have yet to find out...) uncovered that Victor Klemperer is actually a Swedish Catholic... I would love to know if anyone else has heard about this book being a ""fraud""?Regardless, the 560+ page book is a long, and at times, a somewhat laborious read. I kept reading because he had SO much to say. The difficulty in reading this huge diary is his way of writing: He isn't a fluid diarist and it is all a bit choppy; however, I just couldn't put the ... thing down! He gives a good account of what the Gestapo did to the Jewish residents of Dresden, and if you want a historical look at this part of Europe during WWII, this diary has it all!"
5,A Very Detailed Daily Diary of Nazi Torment !,"The author Victor Klemperer clearly tells it how it really was for Jews in Nazi Germany from 1942 to 1945. No, it's not the same details we're always horrified by. It's the simple everyday ""normal"" activity restrictions that the Nazi's imposed on the Jews that hits home. In addition to the atrocities we're familiar with, Mr. Klemperer kept detailed accounts of daily life for Jews. For example, Jews could not buy flowers, ride bikes or enter subways. He describes the hard labor he was forced to perform, in spite of the fact that he suffered from a heart ailment. His diary also details the many kindnesses performed by German citizens, pointing out that there always remain some good folks among the bad. This book of over 550 pages takes some time to read. But it is well worth the time. The author succeeds in providing a more vivid picture that we perhaps had previously not seen. Well worth reading . . ."
5,Beautiful,"Smokey sings the standards with a pleasant and slight difference. All the cuts are so very good, the very best being ""I Love Your Face""."
3,Some very good chapters,"Richard A. Shweder's ""Moral maps, first world conceits, and the new evangelists"", Samuel P. Huntington's ""Cultures count"", and Jeffrey Sachs' ""Notes on a new sociology of economic development"" are the best chapters to read, stimilating, and full of wits of multiple culturalism. Sachs' chapter points to a direction of the marginal explanation power of institutional analysis (though he might not realize it when he saw the relevance of geography determinism). In any case, you don't want to miss Shweder's chapter."
4,shows culture does matter - kind of,"This book contains some interesting articles about culture in politics. I think the authors do establish that different countries do have different political cultures. However, I don't think the book actually proves its title, namely that culture matters. It's never clear whether culture is a product of political institutions and economic conditions, or vice versa. It's just as possible much of the empirical evidence they cite could be used to justify the claim that culture is merely a manifestation of deeper factors. It's worth a read if you're interested in culture, but don't expect definitive answers."
4,THE BEST OF JAMES GARNER,"THE PILOT EPISODE OF THE ROCKFORD FILES, A HOUR LONG CRIME SHOW STARRED BY JAMES GARNER AS JIM ROCKFORD, A PRIVATE DETECTIVE RECENTLY RELEASED FROM PRISON (FOR A CRIME HE NEVER COMMITTED) WHO LIVED IN A TRAILER IN MALIBU BEACH. ONE OF THE BESTS SHOWS IN THE 70'S ORIGINAL AIRED IN SEPTEMBER OF 1974 THROUGH JULY OF 1980. UNTILL TODAY WE CAN WATCH SOME SPECIALS REUNIONS OF THE ORIGINAL CAST IN MADE FOR CABLE SEQUEL MOVIES. AS KOJAK, THE MACMILLAN COUPLE, MAGNUM AND MCGARRETT FROM HAWAII 5-0, JIM ROCKFORD IS ONE OF THE UNFORGETABLE CRIME FIGHTERS OF TELEVISON."
3,"Great show, awful DVD","Rockford Files is great which is why I purchased it in the first place. However, the third disk would not play on side B and therefore missed the season's last 4 episodes. Considering that I paid 32 dollars for it, it makes me wonder if I should order season 2."
4,"Classic TV 'Mysteries' done tongue-in-cheek, Rockford Style","One the more underrated series of the 70's, 'The Rockford Files' was cleverly plotted, well-acted, and never took itself too seriously. Nobody could have played such a role to perfection other than James Garner. Coming off playing 'Bret Maverick' and a dozen or more movie roles, he settled right into the character and established it almost instantly as a TV legend. Great supporting cast (always loved that 'Rocky') and a breezy, easy going style that was so easy to watch. I fondly recall watching this show as a young teenager (Friday nights at 7 PM), and its great catching up with it again after all these years.Thus far I've watched roughly half the episodes and only had one 'stick' on me. So, I give the show 5 stars, but the DVD collection itself a 4.Bring on season two!"
4,Bought it for my mom,"My mom is a huge fan of James Garner, and thus a huge fan of The Rockford Files. She loved this set, and had no complaints. I personally haven't checked it out to go through extra features and what not, but it seems that any Rockford fan will enjoy owning this set."
5,WHERE ARE YOU ROCKFORD FANS,"Sadly no one wrote a review about how great the series is AFTER it has been released on DVD. So it takes someone from the Far East (Singapore) to do this. Otherwise, Season Two may never see the light of the day. Come on American fans!"
2,Too hard to understand and follow,"I was so excited to buy this product for my kids- they have shown an interest in yoga and I thought- great, a program just for them. The person that leads the kids is difficult to understand, her instructions are hard to follow, and she can do the moves completely-while, the kids can not. My kids are 5 and 9."
3,Oceanic,"Oceanic being Vangelis 1996 release and is an Electronica influenced album. Allmusic gave it 1.5/5 which I think is way low. It is not one of Vangelis stronger releases. However, I think it is an alright album and I give it 3/5. The booklet contains artistic photos of synchronized swimmers. 3/5."
5,Excellent Work,"I have listened to all of Vangelis' music. I would regard this CD and 1492 to be two must have CDs if you like his type of music. ""Voices"" is another great CD of his similar to this one in a way. This is not the kind of CD you would appreciate on the first time hearing, and it doesn't become boring too soon. Well done this time, Vangelis."
1,Simple.......It's just not good.,"Stale , boring, dull, uninspired and unimaginative.I can't see how anyone could possibly enjoy this.This is the same old Vangelis. No. Correction, this is Vangelis with all of his inspiration dried up and hoping to make a few bucks.I gave it a chance. I listened to it several times. I threw it away.If you are a stale, boring, dull and unimaginative person, go ahead, buy this CD. I'm sure you will enjoy it...on some heartless and soulless level."
3,A well-crafted piece of work,"Vangelis' Oceanic was released in 1996. Its nine compositions are in a New Age musical direction. I find the songwriting, musicianship, and sound quality to be gratifying. The music of Oceanic is not only soothing and mysterious, but also serene, luxuriant, and therapeutic. While I think that all of the pieces are engaging, ""Bon Voyage"" and ""Sirens' Whispering"" are my favorites. ""Bon Voyage"" is beautiful and touching, and ""Sirens' Whispering"" is relaxing. The CD is almost 51 minutes. Actually, I rate this piece of work 3.5 stars. Oceanic is recommendable."
2,Dover is Not the Wilbur translation!,"Beware! The Dover edition is NOT the wonderful Wilbur poetry translation. It is a lumbering, stilted prose translation based on an 18th century version. The play comes through, but barely. Since no translator was listed and so many reviewers indicated that this was the Wilbur version, I ordered this for my theatre class to read -- disaster! Spend the money on the Wilbur -- it's worth it."
5,"Veuillez me pardonner, Seigneur!","This was one of the books I had to read for college back in the late 1980's. It had been just a few years after the PTL Scandals and Jimmy Swaggart's weepy confession (I'm sure many of you remember these incidents). My professor pointed out the simmilar attitudes between them and the character Tartuffe. Tartuffe, when you get to know him, is really a cheap bum using religion to get what he wants. It's not long before the family he's mooching off finds out what a snake he really is (and the results are hilarious)! Written back in the 19th century, it's amazing how simmilar events were back then compared to more recent history! The title you read translated in English is ""Please forgive me, Lord!""."
5,This UNWRAPPED CD in EXCELLANT CONDITION,This CD had NO SEALING TAPE ADDED at the Factory or no Plastic Wrapping either.and it was in EXCELLANT CONDITION.
5,Arabic Made Easy,"I have owned this book for many years, and I consider it to be a real gem for the absolute beginner. Unlike most books I have seen, the Arabic font is actually large enough to be read without a magnifying glass. Moreover, concepts learned here seem to stick! My only complaint: I am a beginner in Arabic, and I cannot determine whether this book is Modern Standard Arabic, or a regional tongue such as Eastern, Egyptian or Gulf Arabic. Usually, the student is told up front in the preface. Whatever it is, it is certainly well organized. Highly recommended!"
4,Surfin 60's 90's style,"I love most Mondo recordings. This one is pretty good. It has that 60's sound but not as hokey as the original music. I believe these are 90's bands doing tribute to a sound that they may have heard when they were young but I am not certain. I like the camp mockery and the names of the bands and the tunes. Satan's Pilgrims? Mummy Walk? Awesome. The 3D graphics on the cover are what you are paying a little extra for, it's worth a chuckle, especially if you get a tiny pair of 3d glasses in the Case. The whole CD starts out pretty surfin' but ends kind of strange. If you were trying to recreate a beach party most of it would be great but just in case you may want to listen to the whole thing before playing it as mood music for a party."
1,Incredibly stupid and smug,"Like fashion week, this book should have been cancelled.Like the fashion people who provided quotes for the real author, a fashion insider, this book sees itself as oh so witty, is self absorbed, and painfully shallow."
3,Read Ovid AND Bidart!,"""The Second Hour of the Night"" is probably the best long poem written in English in the past few decades. This book was robbed of the Pulitzer, and is worth buying (or just reading) for it alone. The first half of the book is, honestly, just filler. But the second, final poem makes up for it!"
3,"Good stuff, but there seems to be a gap.","Like most of Trudeau's Doonesbury books, this one is well worth the money that you pay for it. Lots of strips, and all the Sunday strips are in their original colors. My only quibble is that the book does not pick up where PLANET DOONESBURY left off; that is, a huge chunk of the strips seem to be missing. As I understand it, the only place to get these strips is in THE BUNDLED DOONESBURY, and they constitute only 1/4 of the contents (the rest of the compilation is strips from VIRTUAL DOONESBURY and PLANET DOONESBURY). While this is a clever marketing scheme to sell to people who are compleatists, I find it reprehensible that Trudeau would gouge his fans like this. Therefore, I can't say that BUCK WILD DOONESBURY totally met my expectations."
4,Good introduction to TCP/IP,Good layman's description of the Internet. Good introductory book that I would recommend to anyone interested in understanding how TCP/IP works.
2,"Weak, inane, and repetivive","The album is extremly weak. If you liked the self titled one, please, spare yourself. It never gets hard enough and it never gets soft enough to make you think. The whole thing sounds like a mix between ""The World I Know"" and ""Gel"" that just doesn't work."
1,It should be about the dogs....very disappointing!,"I purchased this very expensive book in preparation of the arrival of my Shiloh Shepherd puppy. I have to say it is a total disappointment. I think that this book has very little substance and almost no useful information about the breed. I realize that Tina feels very strongly about these dogs, but she choose to write a book about herself and the drama of her life instead of about Shiloh Shepherds. For $75 I expected beautiful pictures and much more information on the lineage of these dogs. I realize that much information was lost, when Tina had her fire, but, I also know that I have had great success finding much more information on the web. I will not return this book , but I also must say I have very little use for it."
3,More techno-pop from Xymox.,"On the heels of Metamorphosis, Headclouds continues Xymox's misbegotten foray into electronica. The band's strength is its dramatic, moody soundscapes most in evidence on early albums such as Medusa and their self-titled debut. Here (with the exception of a few hooky, memorable tracks - Wild Is The Wind and A Single Day) they largely stick to the ""Electronic-chirps-whistles-shrieks-with-the occasional-suggestive-female-moan-set-to-a-drum-machine"" formula. Perfect for the in-store music at Limited Express perhaps, but for fans of the band that also produced the fine A Twist of Shadows and Phoenix albums, Headclouds lacks just a tad musically. Take heart though, Xymox fans! ""Clan of"" has reappeared with Hidden Faces - an album featuring music reminiscent of A Twist of Shadows and Phoenix."
2,A disappointment,"Unlike their truly wonderful album ""Twist of Shadows,"" this follow-up release, after their departure from big-label status, ""Headclowds"" is an utter disappointment, and is not worth buying. As creative, entertaining, and thought-provoking as ""Twist of Shadows"" is, this release is as much the complete opposite. With the exception of maybe one track, it is dull, uninspiring, and very much boringly generic......as if your nextdoor neighbor decided to create a techno-alternative album, but had not yet learned to play any instruments and lacked any creativity. To make a long story short, don't bother."
4,i killed mister moonlight,a showcase for the deep haunting voice of Mr. Murphy. the song's arrangements are sparse and spare and it works as a beautiful minimal piece of recorded live music. the sound quality is pristine and the song selection is superb. a cool document for his fans and the bonus disc should thrill all the bauhaus enthusiasts.
1,"Why people get ""Tough Guys"" and not ""Tough Guise""","I also have been searching for a way to purchase ""Tough Guise."" That film, however, is technically unavailable for individual purchase. On two websites I have searched that exhibit documentary, social awareness, etc. films, Jackson Katz's ""Tough Guise"" is only available for those purchasing from a high school or other institution. :("
3,Decent Mini-Cleaning Kit,"I bought this to clean my first handgun. Since I only have the one gun, I felt there was no need to get a bigger, more inclusive cleaning kit. This kit was purchased to clean a 40 S&W; pistol.Positives: all the pieces fit into the cylindrical handle for easy and small storage and transport. The wire brush is certainly adequate.Negatives: The soft swab was a bit too large for my 40 (even though it was made for that size), and fit through only with some real effort. Also, there are no ""toothbrush"" style brushes, so you'll need to buy at least one.Overall: It is certainly worth the money - especially if you're only cleaning one gun (or same-sized guns). The minute I buy another gun, however, I'm buying a more inclusive cleaning kit with it."
2,Not happy with pendant,It was much smaller that I anticipated. So small can't see guardian angel on pendant. Very disappointed. The pendant had to be magnified to be able to take a picture.
4,Good But Stingy With The Components,These struts are good quality but I find it a little ridiculous that you are supposed to buy the strut boot and spring isolators separately. These are really things that should be replaced along with the struts but I suppose Monroe is more interested in appearing to keep their prices competitive than having a complete kit.
2,Too Repetitive,"I agree that the mood created by Elfman's score is suitably eerie and alien-like, but for an album the music is not so effective. The tracks become far to similar to one another, although the main melody - the opening tracks - is really memorable, and, dare I say it, Jones' Not Unusual is actually pretty brilliant."
5,Product Fine - Shipping Terrible,"The Umbra Tension Rod that I bought is exactly what I was looking for, and since I couldn't find it in any store, I was happy to see that Amazon had it. I cannot find many tension rods (other than shower curtain rods) in the stores, so while I had seen this rod once before, i could only find it here at the length I needed.(This next part is NOT about the product and I've already complained to Amazon but I think people should know.What I was very upset about was the way it was shipped. Perhaps it is the fault of UPS, but the rod came in an enormous shipping box that was torn and mangled. Inside, the rod's box had also been ripped, but luckily the rod was fine.I also purchased a book separately, that came with a fingerprint on it. It was a new book. that upset me as well."
