2,for the advanced,"Don't bother with this DVD unless you already know all the dance moves. They're supposed to teach us how to do the exercises, but on here, the trainer and her very skilled assistants just get right into it. It was hard for me to follow along, because there wasn't any beginning, slow motion of the steps. Because of the above, it wasn't a very effective workout for me."
5,Side Hook much better then Popins of Original,"I was so happy that this strap and transmitter had the strap connecting on the side instead of the snap in using the transmitter, since the tabs on the transmitter broke within a week of original purchase, and that was just taking it on and off for normal use.The previous one still worked even though the little tab pieces broke but I had intermittent problems and I feel it was caused by the possible unsecure connection with those broken tab parts missing.I was also not sure if it would work with my rs400 since it had the new technology but it worked, put it on and first try it quickly got my heart rate. It was a relief cause I was worried it could have been the watch not the strap that was failing to receive proper HR readings.Got the item on schedule, came in sealed retail packaging within a padded envelope."
4,works well,"Warning. Amazon reviews and descriptions can be deceiving. This transmitter works wonderfully with a wide distance on a Precor treadmill and is light weight, fits (comfortably) a medium to xx-large men's chest and doesn't require a lot of maintenance. The contacts are wide enough to make good skin contact on your chest and is easy to snap on and off. The price was good, too. Buy from Amazon, not from the other listed vendors, you get timely (and free) shipping, no taxes and a quality product."
2,Polar Wearlink,I bought a new heart rate monitor and this transmitter came with it. I have had to replace the battery after about 9 months which was no big deal. Since than I have had so many problems with the transmitter stopping in the middle of a run. I have replaced the battery so many times that the cover now is stripped which means I have to replace the entire sensor since Polar does not just sell a cover. I would probably not buy another Polar. I am disappointed in their lack of reasonable support of the product. I thought having a replacement battery was a positive however the design flaws make the device unstable after the cover and battery is removed.
1,Constant problems.,"My wife and I both bought Polar FT60 heart rate monitors in 2009. We like the FT60 watch unit, but the Wearlink transmitters have caused us so many problems that we went back to using the T31 transmitters from our old Polar heart rate monitors. I've replaced the batteries several times and even after that I have constant problems receiving the heart rate. The T31 transmitters are much more reliable and we finally threw away our Wearlinks. If you need a replacement transmitter, I highly recommend buying the older style T31 tranmitter."
2,Lasts a year and fails,"I purchased the Polar Heart Rate Monitor, and it and the included Wearlink strap are a nice combination when they're working. But at about 11 months I started getting eratic readings. Not the battery, not the strap, it's the transmitter. I've read other reviewers who have experienced the same problem. Polar has always had excellent products but this is a very short life span for the expense of this monitor and strap. Polar recommends disconnecting both sides from the strap connectors each time the transmitter and strap are removed. This didn't help my situation.I'll try the newer W.I.N.D. transmitter and strap and hope it lasts longer than the original strap."
4,Comfortable,"More comfortable than my old strap, but doesn't want to work on my older watches. Guess its time for a new watch."
3,Mixed bag,"I bought this as a replacement for an older non-replaceable battery strap. This strap is thinner and more comfortable than my previous model but the battery compartment is thicker, bulkier and not as user friendly. It tends to stick when I do prone Yoga positions. Other than that, it sure beats having to buy an entire new system. Let's see how long this one lasts before the battery needs to be replaced. I have read other reviews on this product and the big criticism is that after the initial battery needs replacement they don't last as long as the original."
1,Not Happy With Wearlink,Used the old model tc31 for years with no problem. My children bought me a wearlink coded transmitter and it lasted a little over a year before it started to give me problems. At times it would take a minute of two before it would begin to work or sometimes just quit during my workout. I have replaced the battery but still have the same problem. I also had an extremely difficult time trying to remove the back cover to the transmitter. The slot looks like it has gone through heck and I may not be able to get the cover off again. I started using the old transmitter and am very happy with it. Not satisfied with the wearlink.
2,Battery died in 3 days. Should have a fresh one for the price!,Battery died in 3 days. Should have a fresh one for the price! I was a little dissapointed but glad it was just an old battery and not a defective product.
4,polar transmitter and strap,"the product was in perfect condition, functions properly and is the perfect replacement strap and transmitter, product arrived in a timely manner and was a good value for the purchase price"
3,A little smaller than Huggies,These are great diapers but they are a little smaller than huggies pull-ups and they don't have the re-attach strips on the sides. You either need to rip them off or pull them completely down. It's ok if they are only peeing in them but when they do more it makes it a little messy.
1,"Cartel, meet wastebasket","It has sat patiently -- and, thank God, quietly -- in the house for a year, and today was the day it got it's spin and the only thing I can think of is, 'gentlemen, please find day jobs.'"
2,Arabian Nights,"The movie was good, but I was disappointed, because it was not the movie I was trying to find. Maybe you can help with that. The movie I was trying to find had Maria Montez (and Danny Kaye - I think). It was sort of an Arabian movie, but it had music of Rimsky Korsakov (I have no idea what the name was). Any suggestions as to how I might find that movie? I'm not too good looking for things like this."
5,Great,This is a fantastic sampling of Wolfe's work. Some parts I have re-read countless times. Wolfe is among the best writers we have. (And this book is nonfiction...which is why I'm glad his next book will be nonfiction).
5,Mind-Altering Read,"Reading this book was like reading a drug and becoming entwined in a foreign boundary-less netherworld of the senses. To say it was lyrical is totally inadequate. It was a labyrinth of discovery, a mesmerizing, poetic, erotic journey into the unknown. I've never, ever become immersed in a book the way I did with this one. I felt as if I'd tumbled into the story and become Liza. It left me dizzy, dazed, exhausted and wanting more. I highly recommend this book if you want to truly experience another culture. The language is pure magic and the plot ingenious."
1,WARNING: THIS ENCLOSURE DOES NOT SUPPORT ASIAN CHARACTER CODEPAGE,"I purchased this network hd enclosureafter running the wizard, and found an ip, and logged in.....I started to configure, but on advanced->character codepage support, I am surprised there's no ANY Asian codepage supportthis is a no-bone dealI have a lot of audio and video files are named in Trad Chinese character, this crash the unit everytime when I attempt to transferalso, you have to be aware if the host's username is XXXX XXXX, you're recognized as guest, this is another no-bone dealif you're going for low-price network hard drive, pls go elsewhereor if you are planning to buy this enclosure in order to store a lot of files are in Asian names, DO NOT BUY IT!!!don't tell me I didn't warn you"
5,EFFECTIVE AND SOOTHING TEA FOR KIDS THROAT,"I always start my son on this tea when he starts a cold. He actually now asks for it. I prepare it and put it in a thermo for him to drink during the day at school. It works wonders when he starts drinking it right away when the symptoms are obvious. The throat does heal from this tea. If he starts it after the illness has taken full course, it still helps it sooth it a lot. My son loves it and I have recommended to other friends who now buy it all the time. Great effective results!!!"
2,Stablility issue,The previous version Trendnet TEW card for wireless G worked really well for me. So I was hoping for same experience in upgrading to Trendnet wireless N. But unfortunately this card have stability problem and would often disconnect. Now I've to constantly do a manual disconnect and reconnect to establish network connection. I think it's better that I revert back to the previous Trendnet wireless G.
2,Just okay,"This doll was not especially well made. It will hold up for a child careful with toys but certainly not for a ""rough and ready"" child. I would look further next time."
4,Underground,A good World War II movie about the Germans that were against the Nazi regime and conducted an undergroung resistence movement.
2,Big and Bulky,"I was surprised when I recieved this case as it was bigger than I expected, also much thicker than it looks in the pic. It is merely a shell for your pda. I found mine hard to open and it was a pain trying to get the stylus out. Still it will protect your tungsten better than a leather case and it has 2 slots for extra cards. I am a nurse and like to carry mine in my pocket at work and this case was just too big."
2,Tungsten E2 Case,"The item I received did not have the features that were advertised on Amazon. Although it looked similiar to the item on-line, it was not the same item as described on-line by Amazon. Therefore, I am using he product as is, because it works. However, I am very unhappy and disappointed; and, do not feel that I received the value for my money. I feel that someone was just trying to empty out their inventory of old items on hand.If I had to do it over, I would probably purchase it elsewhere where I would get what I ordered."
1,This item killed my Palm!,I attribute the loose fit of the Palm in the case to a major malfunction of my Palm (including the erase of all my data and inability to synch properly). Certainly flops around in case. The only foam that came with the case was meant for stabalizing it in the packaging. Construction: aluminum and plastic. Design inconvenient for accessing pen and charging and synching cable inputs.Thanks to Amazon.com for making returns so easy!
3,Loses Palm form factor . . .,"The review by Harvey below is very accurate and informative. However, there are two additional comments that might be helpful.1) With this case you lose the comfortable ""handheld"" feel (curved sides & just the right size) that is so classic with the Palm; holding the case and the Palm for any length of time (such as doing a Sudoku puzzle) your hand gets uncomfortable. The case is about 3/4 inch wider than the Palm.2) The case weighs just about as much as the Palm E/E2 so you virtually double the weight of what you are carrying around.I have reverted back to the leather flap that came with my E2, and a rubber band to hold it tight while the E2 is in my pocket."
1,Case latch brike,"Product looks nice and worked for a few weeks, the the latch that hold the lid shut broke off. Too much hassle to return since I have already thrown away the reciept."
3,Mildly good case,I like the case but the way it locks leaves a little to be desired. I am a medical student and needed something to keep my Palm secure. This case helps but I found that a Pelican case works much better. I also found that the case scratches easily leaving the black undercoat exposed looking like it has gone through a war and back.
4,Another great book by Sherryl Woods.,A lovely story about true love conquering all. Very touching story of two people who have been hurt once but are willing to try again.
2,Where's the beef?,"Any computer hardware is useless without the proper drivers to power them and this pice of hardware is incompatible with Vista.The incoherent manual is well documented by other users, so no further comment is needed.The card did work well enough intitally, before crashing my system."
4,watch,Watch arrived as expected. Price vs quality was great. I think the watch was nicer in person than appears and my son really liked it.
1,The Super Sinking Sailing Boat,"I bought this boat from a toy store in Washington and had it for about 3 months, in that time I sailed it maybe 4 times. The boat looks good and for the money you think your really getting a nice boat, but after the few times that I sailed her she started to become unresponsive to the Tx, and a sloshing sound was coming from inside. This wouldn't be a problem on a more expensive boat but this boat has no access to the internal electronics making replacement of parts and drainage impossible. In my opinion save your money and buy a slightly more expensive boat like the Nirvana II."
1,COMEDY WITH A PROBLEM: IT'S TERMINALLY UNFUNNY.,"This was to be the first of a series of comedies cued to the enormous success of, and utilizing many of the same players from, England's ""Carry On"" comedies. Only two were made, and this one demonstrates the principal shortcoming leading to the series' end. Despite the presence of an attractive cast, and the same frantic pace which commanded audience approval for the ""Carry On"" films, ""Dentist in the Chair"" is betrayed by an extraordinarily inane script."
3,Ok needs some work,"I liked this movie. It was good, but there is too much of a gap before the killings. Parts did make you jump and the end was pretty good. I love JLH and SMH they are great. Kevin Williamson is a good writer, but the director is just not as good as Wes Craven (Scream which Williamson wrote) I do recommend this film."
3,"It was good at the time it came out, but now its entertainment just is'nt there...","This movie was great a couple of years back when it came out. If I'm correct it came out in 1997 or 98. I just bought the DVD a week ago and after watching it again for the 5th or 7th time, it's just not working. Maybe its because I've seen it soo many times and have grown bored with it. At the time it was a fresh good idea, but now its just getting old. The cast is great and some seens are eye catching, but for me I really thought I was going to get the thrill out of watching it again, and I guess not. This movie is similar to the movie 'Urban Legends' which if you watch this movie, you'll here one of the cast mention 'Urban Legend'...If you've never seen this movie before, I would reccommend watching it, because its worth watching it once or twice, but im still alittle iffy on whether or not its worth buying to add to your DVD collection..."
2,this movie was ok,"this movie could have had more.I honestly thought the book was better.I mean i scream more when i babysit during the summer and the kids are watching teletubies or barney.this movie had the basic horror film plan you know people get killed and there is always a survior or two.to me ""nitemare on elm street"" was better."
2,it was ok,i didn't find this very scary . it was all just blood and guts . if you guys find that interesting than go ahead and watch it till your brains rot more than they already are . i didn't think that there was much more to this movie than screaming and blood . it was ok the first time i guess but NOT a movie you would want to buy . don't waste your time
2,Weird,"Although I only saw parts of it (I'm really not into horror) I've gotta say it was weird. Call me stupid but I didn't get it. Even when I wasn't watching I was still listening and it just didn't make sense. My friends told me I had to ""watch"" the movie to understand it, but I do my ""listening"" thing to every horror movie I ever saw...err...heard, and I always get it. I can't say I don't recomend this movie, but if you have to turn your back on everything scary don't watch it, you won't get it."
5,Scary and Very thrilling,I know what you did last summer is a great pop corn flick because The movie starts out with the four teens celebrating and they run over a fishermen while driving drunk a year later someone sends a letter to one of them saying that they know what they did and then the killing starts and does'nt stop to me the best part is when Sarah Michelle Gellar is getting kill it's the most thrilling and scariest part which makes the film great.
1,Abominable.,"Watching this movie you can feel your brain cells dying. This crass marketing ploy masquerading as a feature film deserves to be thrown atop the cinematic junk heap along with all the other idiotic teen ""horror"" films of the past few years.Nothing about this movie deserves anything even remotely deserving credit. No amount of ""cutey-pie"" star power, hip plotting, and cool songs can salvage what ultimately is a hollow, meaningless slur on the horror genre.Avoid at all costs!"
1,Does not even work as camp,"It is really sad that there is an entire generation that thinks this is a horror movie. It contains every ""slasher"" cliche in the book as has some of the worst acting ever comitted to film.Maybe John Waters could have done this justice. He's the only one who would have seen the lame material for what it was - crass comercialsim."
1,A WASTE OF TIME FOR ANYONE WITH A BRAIN,I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER should've been called I KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CRAPPY MOVIE. I mean this is the worst blood and guts garbage since friday the 13th movie series. You can pretty much figure out who the stalker turned killler is pretty early in the movie and of course there's no suspense as a result. Avoid this movie and it's sequel that I here is out at all costs!!!
1,Maybe they were out to prove a point,"Maybe the producers were trying to prove once again that writers should live in fear of Hollywood optioning their novels. If anything got killed in this movie, it was Duncan's book. As if this weren't bad enough, the movie views like a cheap imitation of ""Scream"". Well, at least Hewitt and Gellar weren't too bad to look at..."
3,Average but effective,"If I remember correctly, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" came out in the wake of ""Scream."" While it wasn't nearly as witty as ""Scream,"" IKWYDLS (that's one long title...) succeeds in existing as a middle-of-the-road teenage slasher flick that happened to do well at the box office because, unlike the barrage of slasher movies in the 80's, this one had a cast that people recognized. For the most part, they manage to actually act pretty well, and there are a couple of clever moments that I won't give away in case you haven't seen this.Overall, I can't really find anything to complain about, but there's also not much here to get thrilled about, either. Worth 90 or so minutes of your life, but maybe not the $15 to pick it up on DVD."
3,the slasher films are getting a bit tired but...,"at this point in time, nobody can make an original horror flick, but this does have a difference to it. teenagers hit a guy with their car, they dispose of the body, the next summer he comes back. the cast is good, the writing is good, yet the villain is stupid. there isnt a lot of gore either. it wont appeal to anyone over 17 (ironically, the movie is rated R so they expect people over 17 to see it). adults will find it tacky. teens: see it."
3,Kevin Williamson's Script Is On The Money.,"Kevin Williamson made a good follow up to his Scream film, with this great film. The film about friends who do something and keep the secret is very terrifying and Williamson does this very good. Extra points go out to all the major hotties in the film."
2,Next Time That You Decide To Hide A Body - Think Again,Great stars...excellent script with bone chilling scenes. A MUST SEE MOVIE.
5,A Terrific Horror/Thriller Movie,"I havn't actually read the book, but the movie is brilliant! It made me and my mates jump. I casn't wait until the sequel is released. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt were both brilliant. The movie was so good, that it has made me lost for words and I cannot write anymore, other than, Kevin Williamson- Scream was good, I know what you did last summer was better! END"
3,It's not Scream,"I will make the obvious comparison. This Kevin Williamson screenplay is nowhere near as ingenuous, thrilling, energetic, engaging, etc as Scream. In other words, lacking in excitement. The ""teen"" stars give fairly good performances, but I did not feel for them as I did the victims of the Masked Killer in Scream. See this movie if you have nothing else better to see and just want to pass the time."
2,One star for Anne Heche the other for S-M. Geller,"I'm sorry but I thought the movie reaked. If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother. For one thing, it brutilized Louis Duncan's book. For more things, it has bad (FAKE) corpses, the ppl (w/the exception of the two mentioned on top) did NOT show any of their wonderful acting talent, and the guy w/the hook was absolutely pathetic. Okay, okay. Watch it if you want a good laugh."
5,I Know What You Did Last Summer?,"This Film is about 4 teens celebrating their graduation, when they accidently run over a man walking on the side of the road.They all panic but then decide the best thing to do is throw him into the river, and they take a vow to, as they say in the film, ""Take it to the grave"". And that is exactly what they do! They start getting letters saying ""I know what you did last summer"".Then stange things start happening. For example, Helen Shivers(Sarah Michelle Geller) goes to bed one night and wakes up the next morning with pieces of her hair hacked off.And her boyfriend (Ryan Phillipe) goes to the gym and gets knocked down by someone who stole his car from outside the gym.These are only some of the strange antics that go on in this film.It's a cross between ""NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET"" and ""SCREAM"".I would give this film a star rating of 5 and i would recommend it to everyone(under 18 that is......)"
5,DEFINITELY SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR'S GREATEST HIT!,"To be honest, I really only wanted to see this movie because I am a HUGE fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar (from upcoming hits ""Cruel Intentions,"" ""Scream 2"" and ""Simply Irresistible."") She is a truly great actress and I was SO mad when she got...oh don't let me spoil the movie. But all I need to say is that if you read the book it's nothing like the movie but both book and movie are great so just enjoy the whole concept of I Know What You Did Last Summer."
1,A Scream rip-off,"Oh, the horror! I saw this on pay-per-view (thank the Lord I didn't go to the theater) and was mortified. I didn't enjoy the plot, and I didn't enjoy the bad acting by Jennifer Love Hewitt and gang. What a waste of my time! Just another attempt to cash in on Scream's popularity. And to think they made a sequel to this: I Still Know What you did...The ending was bad, they could have come up with someone else as the killer."
3,I Know What You Did Last Summer Review,"This film starts fairly well, but then it becomes another routine slasher. I suppose if something is worth doing in Hollywood, it's worth overdoing. The best thing about this movie is John Debney's suspenseful score, which makes the movie watchable. The enhanced 2.35:1 DVD is of high quality."
1,Dat'l Do It for Me,"If you are into eating matter, and when I say matter I mean groupings of atoms that make Golden Corral look like food fit for the strictest Gourmand, then Dat'l Do It is the Hot Sauce for you. This sauce has no flavor, little heat, and has the consistency and aroma of flem. I would highly recommend avoiding this product as you would a fetid raccoon carcass."
1,Really Disappointed...,"I've been trying to find a book for learning Adobe Audition, but this one is the worst. It really pretends to be a reference manual. It is really heavy and tired to learn the software based on a bad reference manual. I advise to learn the help file it's easier and a more direct way. I'm trying to learn Adobe Audition 2.0. Why do I have to loss time learning the differences with version 1.5? I'll continue looking for a really tutorial o self teaching course."
2,Useful only to start,"If you have never seen Qt, this is a useful book. It has a good explanation of the concepts and basic programming.But if you are spending your time reading the online documentation and coding, the book soon becomes useless and goes to the desk eternally.I bought it because O'Really book looked outdated. I think there is a new edition comming soon."
3,"aaaah, now i get it.","okay, this movie was junk, and the one that came before it wasn't too much better, but i've noticed that a lot of people haven't seen the connection between the two. basically, the first one was little red riding hood. the second one? hansel and gretal. you're welcome."
2,pretty pathetic,"i didn't think the acting was all that great. the barfing scenes get old (and real disgusting) real quick. i could say the same for the characters. all you can do is shake your head. what was the point of this movie? a disgusting spectacle? it succeeds there.i'll give it this much: i kept watching, and actually started getting interested in the story a good hour into it. mildly interested, that is, when they reach tijuana and catch up with sister gomez (vincent de gallo). she takes them under her wing with the purpose of helping exercise them of their demons (for a fee). anyway, i won't give anything away. still, after finishing this movie i almost felt like barfing - but even that makes the whole thing sound more moving that it was. what a joke. the biggest joke though is that some people are gonna pay 50 bucks for this dog. i checked out 'confessions' because i liked de gallo in buffalo 66 which was great. this one isn't."
5,Strong beats and percussion gonna make you move!,"I love the energy of this girls voice and songs. Her version of Donna Summers ""Love's about to change my heart"" [Fuego de passion] is great. Actually the dub version from Donnas' 12"" overlays rather well with Monicas' vocal. Several other good dance tunes as well. I look forward to buying alot of her and don't even speak spanish!!"
5,My elleventh Hardy Boys book!,"This book is one of the Hardy Boys bookes I read where the Hardy Boys are prisinors with only about twenty pages left in the book. What got me to read this book is the way the cover is green. So if your looking for the Hardy Boys book ""Danger On Vampire Trail"" just look for a Hardy Boys book with a green cover. I like mysterys and the Hardy Boys got me to make my own mystery series called ""The CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER Series"". In around twenty years look for my books in ""The CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER Series"" because I want to be a writer when I grow up."
4,"Beautiful Display - RCA Video recording, not so much.",Installed in an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ system under Windows XP Pro OS. TV tuner is great. The guide is great. S-Video input and audio inputs are great. FM tuner is great. Unable to get unit to display RCA video input. Tried two different VCR's. Since my main reason for buying this was to get high resolution recordings of my VHS library and copy to DVD's I was rather disappointed.
2,Not bad but not the greatest,"Very hard to use with direcTV since you have to have the reciever box in order to change channels. volume is really low when you watch tv so you have to turn it up really loud and scares the hell out of me when I get an instant message cause its soo loud. The video quality is average its not sharp and crisp. Also has a really slow reaction speed. When i control the DirecTV reciever it takes about 3-4 seconds for it to show on screen which at times is very annoying. The recording quality is so so when i watched a playback there were horizontal lines everywhere and was a little bit blurry. And on DirecTV you cant choose shows that you want to record becuase you have to set it to the channel the show is on and then set the time you want it to record because you can't control the channels from your computer. You basically set it on channel 3 then set the channel on the reciever. As for the software, cant even use guide plus becuase its not cable."
1,Not as advertised,"This product is advertised to have a ""crystal clear"" view.Not even close.Also, the software packaged with it, is not supported by ATI.For technical support, be sure to dial the new 800 number.When I bought it, they only had a toll number so I used my cell phone. I received a charge on my next bill for a 75 minute call to Canada for $45.00.Beware of this product and any other TV tuner ATI offers. The concept makes sense, but they have not perfected it yet.It would have been cheaper for me to get a color TV with a built in DVD player.Paul"
1,Another Anti-Catholic Manifesto,"This book is written in the same spririt as Roman Catholicism by Lorraine Boettner. Both of these books fan the flames of the uneducated, ignorant, bigot who makes it his/her mission in life to destruct and/or destory the Roman Catholic Church. If one is truly interested in learning about the first and biggest Christian church, then he or she should read the Catholic Study Bible, by Donald Senior, Editor, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and An Introduction to the New Testament, and the Catholic Encyclopedia by Robert C. and Virginia Broderick. If one would rather get false and grossly distorted information about the Roman Catholic Church, then read the books by Mr. Lambert and Mr. Boettner."
3,A Friend And Entertainer,"I was a personal friend of the last ""Old Mother Riley""Mr.R.Rolland"". To get to the film,This is one of the best plots of the ""Mother Films"".This is Arthur Lucan at his best.We see Mother in her usual roll in the Laundry,up to her usual tricks,Until lady luck smiles,We have dauter Kitty (Kitty McShane)Puting up with Mothers Antics.We Are entertained with a song from Kitty McShane Accompanyed by the ""Luton Girls Choir"",a Popular English choir of the 1940s. In one of the scenes We see a very clever Piano,Very good for it's day.Watch and Enjoy."
1,Absolutely the WORST in the series... and I have read about 80%,"WTF. This guy who wrote this... Did he just transfer his diary into a short story form.The WORST 33 1/3 of the lot.STAY AWAY!Nothing about the Smiths making an amazing LP, just some wanker's youth in the pages of a book I boughtin hopes it would be at least 1/2 a s good as any of the others in this series.Next>"
4,"really quite brilliant, what are you other reviewers reading?","wow, i'm shocked so many people didn't like this book...i thought it was awesome! a touching little slice of life reflection...funny and sweet and a little sad...just like the album itself. a great addition to the series, actually my favorite so far! (reading them in order)."
4,Good buy!!!,Completely worth.. Its good to have drill bit set at home.. It could ve been better with some metric bits in them...
4,Short term review,"Well they came packaged decent enough though the case itself is a little cheesey. I've only used them once and they cut damn quick through some 1/8"" steel bar."
4,A very good study reference,This book contains most of the facts needed to pass your OCP exams. It is well worth the price.
4,Bottom line --- Passes exam 1 and 2,"This book contained numerous errors, but bottom line it helped me to pass the Oracle DBA Exams 1 and 2 on the first try. Not perfect, but functional."
1,The worst attempt at a technical review guide ever seen.,"I don't wish to simply bash Mr. Ault's book, but this certification ""aid"" is by far the most poorly organized and least thought out book I have ever come across. There is no clear breakdown of review material for the PL/SQL and DBA tests. The topics covered regarding PL/SQL are not explained other than a definition and parameter listing that one could easily find verbatim on the Oracle Documentation Library CD. The sample test enclosed covering PL/SQL is not at all like the sample test downloadable from the Oracle website. (One has to believe that Oracle has a better idea of what the test is like than Mr. Ault). I urge you not to waste your money as I did, this book will be off no use in your preparation. The Oracle Press Exam Guide will prove much more useful."
3,read a reference manual instead. This is a reference manual,"Altogether not that bad. It helped me a little. If you want to pass, don't rely entirely on this book. Use Couchman's book instead (Baird's is not bad either).It is true that this book is poorly organized."
2,The book suffers from mistakes and bad organization,"This is NOT a good book, and seems to have been rushed to press. First of all, it contains some serious typographical and editing errors, which unfortunately mar several sample questions. Second, it is badly organized. The material for Exams 1 and 2 are intermingled together, making it difficult to know from reading the book what you need to know for Exam 1 versus Exam 2. Exam 2 material is given short shrift and is basically inadequate. Far too much of the book is just diagrams of SQL commands with a few comments about the clauses: you might as well just read the manuals. The best part of this book is the sample tests, which sometimes force you to think about the material more deeply. Too bad there are mistakes in these tests. It cost a lot more, but I would get the Oracle Certified Professional DBA Certification Exam Guide by Jason S. Couchman."
2,Doesn't cover all of the material it advertises to,Sorry - but it is not as advertised folks. I just received the book today and was very disappointed to discover that the book only covers HALF of the information required to pass the OCP DBA exam. It is advertised to cover all material but in fact only addresses that required to pass TEST1 and TEST2 of the 4 part OCP certification exam series. It does not cover the Backup and Recovery or Performance Tuning components - look like someone missed a publishing deadline.
5,"Cook, Dixon & Young",Absolutely incredible. Fantastic singing; great movement & stage presence. Can only give it the very hightest recommendation.
5,loved it so much I bought one for a friend,I've had one for about a year and found it user friendly and dependable. I've owned several and this one has been much more dependable than the others. I bought one for a friend trying to lose weight. Love it. The product arrived in a timely fashion.
4,Entry level heart monitor,"If you want a simple, basic heart rate monitor this will work for you. It works well and does exactly what it says it will do.It's my first monitor so I wasn't sure which features I'd need.Now that I do have some experience with it, however, I do know now I'd go with a more feature rich model.This model does NOT keep a record of individual results for multiple activities in a single day.The display will show either HR% or BPM (beats per minute) but not both at the same time.You cannot upload your workout results to Polar's website.And some of Polar's other models have additional functionality that sound interesting (whether I'd use them or not, I'm not sure).Once my battery dies I'm going for either the F6 or F11."
2,not durable enough,"This watch worked great for about 6 months. Then the buttons on the sides fell off. A month after that, the alarm completely stopped working. The watch is easy to use and has several different functions, but for the price I didn't expect it to fall apart after 6 months."
2,"If you need a crash course on cyberpunk, this is it...","..because it rips off just about every notable story in the genre, from Gibson's <u>Neuromancer</u> all the way through Rudy Rucker's <u>Software</u> and into <u>A Clockwork Orange</u>. The fairest thing that I can say about the novel is that it takes an unusual approach for the genre, which is to say that it is told from the point of view of a just-post-adolescent urban spelunker in France, and music figures very heavily into the storyline. That aside, there really isn't very much original material in this novel. It puts a slightly different spin on the references that are in place, but if you're looking for something completely new, this certainly isn't it. In good conscience, I can't recommend this book to anyone unless you really want a whirlwind introduction to some of the better, and certainly more notable works in the genre of cyberpunk."
1,Didn't work at all.,Product didn't work at all. I have to go through Minn Kota for warranty service now. I don't think it's asking too much that a product will work when you buy it.
3,not fully informed,purchased as gift for my grandson. I know he realy likes it and thinks its lots of fun. I don't feel qualified to report any more. they live out of town and we don't get to see them very often.
5,It's a hit,"I bought this for my 4 year old son to tide him over until Christmas. It is so much fun! I even enjoy playing with it. It does make some noise, but it's not too bad and there are 2 volume levels. There are 3 different 'games', the first one doesn't keep count, the second tells you a specific hole to get your ball in (this one is hard, even for me), and the third keeps track of your score for about a minute and a half (this is the one we like best). THe announce shouts out a few encouraging phrases, my son got a big kick out of it saying 'You're on fire' lol. It even remembers your highest score. You can roll the balls or bounce them on a little cloth trampoline. It was very easy to put together and the stickers are already on it. It folds in half for storage, with the 5 balls inside. I would definately recommend it for anyone ages 3 and up."
2,Dissappointing,"Although the book provides a useful summary on a number of areas (for example descriptions of various villiages around LA) I missed practical information, such as:- How does the school system work in USA?- At what age need children go to school?- Practical information regarding moving to LA /USA such as can I use my European electrical equipment there (such as waching machines, etc)?- Practical tips on medical system, doctors, etc.I have seen better."
3,Good guitar chord book.....Quality of book is very bad.....,"Pretty disappointed on the quality of the book by the production company, basically this is a 4 page 8.5x11 book printed on both sides. I was better off searching the internet for a free PDF file, and would have gotten exactly the same or better. But besides that, I give AMAZON five stars for fast and free shipping."
4,Highly recommended.,Fast service. Item was as described and in stated condition. Company was friendly to deal with. Recommended alternative to high priced college bookstores.
4,All the Single Ladies ...,"I'm not single, but I enjoyed the questions posed in this book and now want to read ""Every Woman's Battle."" Mostly, I wish I would have read this book when I was single and engaged because I think it would have helped set a foundation for my marriage. I think it's a valuable read and discussion-opener with great questions like ""Do you expect marriage to eliminate all your sexual temptations?"" and ""Do you want to love God more than anything else? How would that look in your life?"" I look forward to using it in ministry to young women.In exchange for this review, I received a free copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group."
3,Every Single Woman's Battle,"Every Single Woman's Battle is a workbook filled with words of wisdom, challenging, thought-provoking questions for personal reflection and discussion. The author, Shannon Ethridge deals with the issue of purity very openly. This is a radical call for single women to come out of hiding and be totally honest about taking back control of their bodies, hearts, thoughts, and behaviors. Doing this allows them to become the champion of their own lives in their day to day choices and decisions. Many helpful tools and charts for self evaluation, are given in this book. The book would be an awesome small group study among MATURE single women of a church. It would be very helpful to have book available as well.I received this book free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing GroupEvery Single Woman's Battle: Guarding Your Heart and Mind Against Sexual and Emotional Compromise (The Every Man Series) Workbook"
3,wilmas home place,"This is only a workbook it has strategy and insight on singlehood ,but is not that good of a tool.It focus on heart issues and past actionist will be good for children as they enter into adulthood.There are eight chapters to be studied on a weekly basis.Each chapters divided into an introductory section.It has quotes that refer to other books Every Women's battle and Every Man'sIt still is a valuable resource for single women. It helps readers learn to guard their words,actions,thoughts while being drawn closer to god.This book was sent to me free from Water Brook press for my review the options are my own."
3,nice one ..,this product is good to use /// will recommend other s to use it ..... nd smells very very good ...
3,Fun to look at but loose on the wheel,"I drive a red Prius V so I bought the cover to add a touch of ""sporty"". It's a little too loose for my steering wheel but not dangerously so. I'll use it until I find something that fits better."
3,"Looks Cool, Just needs to be blue","I don't actually own this item but by the pictures it looks cool (that's why I gave it an average rating). They need to make a blue colored one, and I'm surprised they don't already, then I'd definitely buy it!"
5,AWESOME!!!,I love the feel of this Steering Wheel Cover! I received it today along with the matching floor mats. The cover itself is very sharp and seems to be of solid construction. I absolutely love the feel of the rubber sections in my hands... makes driving fun again. I absolutely recommend these to anyone!
3,How to Make Your Own Picture Frames,"Excellent book for the beginner (me!). Clear and concise. Excellent step-by-step instructions with photos for each and every step. This book covers all aspects of frame construction, painting, mats, glass-cutting and usage. A great book to trigger your own ideas to create custom frames.Drawbacks: Original publication is 1958, and the tools and techniques used are pretty old (e.g., use of a hand saw and miter box versus an electric miter saw or radial arm saw). Photos are all black and white, so some detail is missing."
4,Great motivator,This product is a cost effective tool for any dedicated fitness program. It plus the Polar personal trainer web site make it easy to track progress toward goals. Tracking calorie burn is especially effective to push my exertion levels during training sessions. Polar's personal trainer web site could be more intuitive.
1,Waste of Money and Time,"The four ab workouts are not intense enough and the moves would sometimes hurt my neck! The cardio segment was absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't follow along mainly because they did too many ""dance"" moves and it was too boring and not increasing my heart rate. Do nottt buy this!"
3,OK general purpose bits,"I've been using these bits for general purpose construction of my house for the last 7 months. For drilling lumber they work well but are very aggressive (as another reviewer pointed out). You need to be very careful not to let the larger bits bite and start screwing into the work piece. Other than that, the pilot point seems to work as intended and really cuts down on bit walk.I just recently tried to use the 1/2"" bit to drill some 1/4"" mild steel plate. After the first hole, the bit was dull and useless. I'm not sure if it was a factory defect or if the bits are just not intended for this type of work. One interesting observation is that the bits do not seem to get hot while drilling into metal."
2,Pilot point? Not sure where it would be useful.,"I was looking for a set of drill bits in the 5/8 - 1/2 inch category, and I happened to see this dewalt set at home depot. I got it thinking its dewalt, its got to be good. Well, maye Im using it for the wrong purpose, but when I drill holes in soft wood like pine, it rips up the wood at the top pretty bad. My old B&D twist drill bits do a cleaner job. Guess I should have done my research before buying this set."
1,I hate these drill bits,"These bits are horrible, I can never get a clean cut with them, because the cut too fast. The grab and pull themselves through the wood more like a screw than a drill bit. Forget about using them for any kind of metal (you'll end up with a ragged chewed up hole that is totally unacceptable). Go with something else and you'll be happier."
5,Puts you in the role of Master Chief!,"This strap is totally, totally sweet. I wear it all the time when I'm playing my X-Box for the ""total experience."" If you want to feel like Master Chief when you're playing Halo 2, you can't go wrong by getting one of these puppies. GRRRRRRRRRRR!!!"
5,The best price I've seen,"I searched for a week to find the best price and ended up back where I started. You can't beat this price if you want a 2GB card. If you have a digital SLR or a high megapixel digital camera, you need lots of storage room. I was once on vacation with a 512mb card and ran out of space because I forgot to offload to my laptop one night! Don't let that happen to you! At this price, who can afford not to have the storage space that you need when the perfect shot (that peacock spreading its feathers, your daughter's first steps, the look of suprise as you hand someone a gift, etc) comes around."
1,Card failed on first day of use.,"This card didn't make it past day one with my new Canon Digital Rebel XT. I shot roughly 50-60 pictures, and then received a CF error on the camera. The images couldn't be read, and no more images could be written to the card. I formatted the card in the camera, shot some more pictures, and again, a CF error. I repeated the process a third time, and decided that this card was not going to be reliable. I was possibily just unlucky and received a defective card, but I have seen other posts where folks have encountered the same issue. I returned the card without hassle and purchased a SanDisk that hasn't given me a single problem."
1,I received a *possibly* corrupt card,"I purchased the Canon XTI and the Kingston 2 GB card together. I have only used this card and another (a 512 MB Kodak brand) in my camera. So far every time I use the Kingston 2GB card at least 1% (and usually up to 5%) of my pictures are corrupt. This has NEVER happened with the Kodak card, which has led me to believe that it is probably the Kingston card. After researching this card online I have found this to be a problem for other people. I plan on purchasing another brand and steering clear of the Kingston brand. It is well worth the extra $$$ to make sure my clients get all of their pictures."
1,hindered by onanism,"i tried to read this book but was too preoccupied by onanism and patricide, the side effects of listening to rock music"
3,UNDERWHELMING,"AFTER THE SEVERAL LAUDITORY COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE WHOM I ADMIRE SUCH AS BILL KRISTOL I EXPECTED MORE. THE BOOK WAS ESSENTIALLY A RAMBLING ESSAY. THE FIRST SEVERAL CHAPTERS WERE CAPTIVIATING BUT THEN BLOOM GOT CARRIED AWAY BY THE ""SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE"". THIS TIMELY AND PROVACATIVE SUBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN DELIVERED MORE CONCISELY."
3,Education via political opinion,"Wordy, harsh with limited acceptance for growing history. Book arrived in excellent shape and in a timely manner"
4,On the Closing of the University Mind,"This book is a great book. If you have ever wonder why we believe what we do, or why some wrong views are so common, this will be a great soul opener. Mr. Bloom discusses the implication of ideas from Socrates to Hegel, all the way to Nietzsche. He moves like an anthropological philosopher plucking ideas (or lack of them) and their implication to America. The book goes meticulously warning us, and ultimately teaching us, of the actual condition of Americas thinkers and what could happen at the end of this trail.This text will prepare the table for a deeper search in the classics that will counter attack the closing of the University Mind, that is really Bloom ultimate goal with this exercise."
1,A concise rebuttal from another great american mind . . .,"""This is not a noble, delicate and sumblime country. This is a mess run by criminals. Performers who are doing the crude, vulgar, repulsive things Bloom doesn't enjoy are only commenting on that fact.""- Frank Zappa, 1988"
2,Elitist nonsense.,"It is disturbing that many people in the academic community have embraced the positions advocated by this book. Bloom's Eurocenrtic elitism is absurdly out of touch with today's America. He rejected almost everything less than three centuries old, which pretty much eliminates the entirity of American accomplishments. Worse yet, he lacked any understanding of the culture that surrounded him. Even basic contemporary concepts like freedom of speech and freedom of the press seem to have eluded him. Nobody disagrees that today's scholars should read the great thinkers of the past. But students living in today's real world have a greater need to develop an understanding and appreciation for today's culture. For better perspectives, I suggest reading ""Culture's Sleeping Beauty"" by Michael Bugeja, ""Legacy of Wisdom"" by John Merrill and any of Arthur Asa Berger's books about interpreting popular culture."
4,Frost viewing gives warm feelingly,"Inspector Frost gives a good mixture of mystey and humor. Seems our good natured Inspector is in hot water with his bumbling boss no matter how good he is at his job. All this while trying to unravel a mystery, could be murder or some other broken law in his hometown of Denton. The building suspense and final conclusion along with a large amount of humor makes for a great evening of entertainment.If I had any complaints it would be that their seasons are so short, some only one show. Bur I have Seasons One thru Fourteen and plan on buying many more, as long as they keep turning them out."
4,"Don't get mad, get Body Wars","I have many issues with my weight and overall apperance, while this (or any) book can't give me magic solutions it is a wealth of insight and inspiration. The author encourages women to focus on our inner selves and social change instead of frivolous wieght and beauty goals pushed on us by advertisers. I reccommend it for all women especially parents and teachers."
5,READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!,"For yourself, for your children, for the women and girls in your life. Read this book! It was like having the wool pulled from eyes. I can finally see the lies for what they were. I was angry about these ""ideals"" for so long and the pressure to get thinner. Now I know why, because it was all a lie to kepp women in their place, make money, and destroy the self esteem of nearly every woman in the Western world."
5,This book is excellent!,"This is a great eye opening book! Great for resources and information about how we as a society harm our bodies and our lives. It also gives helpful suggestions and ideas for activism to fight the war against believing we are only about our bodies.Many statistics and helpful information, yet written in an interesting and easy to follow format.Buy it! You'll love it!"
4,"A fine guide but it's a pamphelt, not a paperback","This is a helpful guide but it's not a paperback book. Rather, it's a pamphelt. So, other than photographs and the names of each bird, there's little in the way of descriptive text."
4,almost perfect,"This dvd is excellent. the only complaint that I personally have is that song ""Hold the Line"" the video song is incomplete, appears under Medley in the back of the DVD box but is just a short part of the video as well as the rest of the songs under Medley. I dont understand why the producers of this DVD did not put the complete video of each song.the rest of the videos are complete and have excellent audio as well. how I wish to have a Toto DVD complete.I recomend plentiful the 25th anniversary DVD is excellent!!!"
5,Smile! Pet Sounds In Glorious Stereo!,"Pet Sounds has been released in stereo. The sound is wonderful as it literally leaps out of your speakers. Paul McCartney is right in saying that this is a masterpiece. Curiously, this album still remains in the shadow of Smile, an ablum that to this day has remained unreleased. However, it stands on its own as Brian's masterpiece and most has been said in the reviews of the original CD and the boxed set. Capitol is generous with this CD but be warned that this does NOT include Trombone Dixie or Unreleased Backgrounds found on the original CD. Now that Capitol has released this, hopefully we will see the 60s twofers and the 70s-80s CDs restored to their catalog. We're still waiting on Capitol for those. This is a start."
2,Pet Pounds,"I know its an unpopular opinion, but I don't understand why this album is so great? I know it's 1966 and there was nothing like it, but there was nothing like the Beatles when they came out and nothing like the Doors first album(around the same time). Sloop John B. and Wouldn't It Be Nice are great arrangments/songs, no argument. I'm not living in a box, I've listened to everything from Love's 'Forever Changes' to the Kinks 'Village Green Preservation Society'. Granted, there's nothing like the Beach Boys harmony, but I would look to earlier songs which display that talent, 'In My Room' for one...at least they are listenable. Paul McCartney's favorite album, so what? Must have somehow reached him on a personal level. My favorite album is Mr. Tambourineman, and its no masterpiece either..."
5,Magnífico,"Es sencillamente magnífico el trabajo realizado con Pet Sounds para DVD Audio, no sólo el sonido (que con sòlo eso valdría la pena comprarlo) sino también los extras: incluye videos, comentarios, y promocionales, que con seguridad quienes han disfrutado de Pet Sounds y de los Beach Boys lo harán. Además no se requiere un equipo de DVD - AUDIO para disfrutar de todas las mezclas especiales y de los extras.El sonido, la presentación y todos los extras son sencillamente magníficos. Cinco estrellas."
4,Grows on you,"I bought this album several years ago after having read that it was written in response to Rubber Soul (am a huge Beatles fan). More recently, having discovered SMiLE, I've started listening to this more, and come to appreciate it more. ""God Only Knows"" is clearly as masterpiece.There's not much I can add that others here haven't already said. I just want to add one thing I'm not sure anyone else has ever noticed (and it's not all to do with the Beach Boys):The Bangles song ""Eternal Flame,"" intentionally or not, seems to be a mixture of ""God Only Knows"" and the Beatles ""Michelle."" Listen to all three, and you'll see why.Just had to get that out. :-/"
4,"Musically superb, lyrically so-so","Mike Love called this one ""Brian ego music."" Problem is, he's right. Some of the instrumentation on this record is breathtaking (""You Still Believe in Me""). Of course the ""hits"" (""Wouldn't It,"" ""Sloop,"" ""God Only,"" ""Caroline, No"") are utterly brilliant, but there are too many ""Maxwell Silver Hammers"" in here to warrant 5 stars. So I hit the skip-forward button. So what. I think ""Today"" and ""Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)"" are better ""Beach Boys"" records. But, ""Pet Sounds"" is still a classic."
2,"Right on, JMAN from Fairfield County!","Yes, Pet Sounds is as good as music gets. But dang it, I want Surf's Up, too! And Sunflower! And Holland! And Carl and the Passions! And Love You! And the Light Album! Heck, I even want 15 Big Ones, Keepin' the Summer Alive and M.I.U.!The Beach Boys produced so many great albums. It's an awful shame that they're no longer available. I think it's a crime."
5,THIS RECORD BLEW ME AWAY!,"I just purchased Pet Sounds on 180 gram vinyl and sat mesmerized on my sofa as the luscious sounds eminated from my speakers. I don't think you have to be Beach Boys fan to appreciate this record (I certainly was not) I am however, a new Brian Wilson fan. In my opinion - if you are a lover of music - you'll be moved by this record."
3,Not Impressed,"As usual, MOFI has done a good job. But tell me again why this album is so highly regarded by fans and critics alike? After weeks on back-back-back-order, I find it quite uninspiring."
3,I wish I could like this more,"I bought this CD back in August and I have only listened to it once(when I needed music to fall asleep to when there was nothing on the radio). I have heard that this CD is ""depressing"", but when I heard it, I found nothing depressing about. Maybe it was because I wasn't concentrating fully on it, but I wasn't impressed. Maybe if I looked at the lyrics(if I could find them) and found the true meaning of the songs I would like it better. Maybe when I listen to it again, I'll give it a better review."
5,Best of a Great Musical Legacy,"I purchased this record the week it was originally released - and it was the first album I purchased as a teen-ager. I wore out several copies over the years, and it's release on CD was one of the reasons why I made the jump to a CD player six years ago. Brian Wilson brought everything he had to this recording, and it shows. The lyrics and music are perfectly matched - this is a work of genius."
2,i really dont hate it that much,"i love the beach boys, but the songs that were not hits, really bit the dust bad. this album only has about 2 songs worth (hence the 2 stars) both of these songs you can find on their greatest hits cd so why bother with the album. this was about the time in their career where every song of theirs didnt sound exactly like the rest which is at least good.overall: eh, nothin worth buyin..."
5,"The Rival of ""Revolver""","This is Pop Music at its more beautiful. A genial vocal work with the correct melody. If ""Revolver""(The Beatles's masterpiece) was considered the best album of the XX century, I should say that ""Pet Sounds"" is problably the natural rival for that album.Essential for any CD's collection. Superb!"
2,For Beach Boy purists only . . .,"This is a nice CD for people who really like th Beach Boys. Still, some others may be disapointed by it since it is really different form songs such as Surfin'USA, Deuce Cup, etc..."
5,Thanks For Sharing,The making of Pet Sounds alone has been one of the most fascinating pop stories. Brian Wilson writing and producing all the songs while the band was on tour. Brian bringing in a new text writer. And disregarding his successful collaboration with Beach Boy member and lyricist Mike love.The album wasn't even as big a hit as many record company executives must have hopen for.But more then 40 years down the road Pet Sounds still ranks in my personal top 5 best albums of all time. Why. Because of the beautiful melodies and ditto lyrics. The orchestration where the guitar no longer played an important part. Because of the fabulous harmonies. Because of the theme of 'growing up' which can be found in most songs. This is definitely a must have album.
5,Correction to Oakland,"The reviewer from Oakland is absolutely correct upon observing that the Stones, Hendrix and Dylan were ""setting the pace"", but there is no doubt that Brian Wilson was among this elite group. Additionally the Beatles never led at anything.As for this album - is it the best ever? It's tough to say, because it's tough to compare ""Pet Sounds"" to ""Are You Experienced?"". Nevertheless, it sure ranks among the best ever recorded (including ""Let it Bleed"" and ""Rumours""), and I believe it's a cut above anything released by the Beatles."
1,"A Masterpiece ? Nope ,not even close","Tears came down from my eyes while listening to this album , as I could not stop YAWNING.How childish , tedious and boring stuff . One star too many for this ."
1,Wrong!!,"Greatest album ever? Try worst album ever, I can't believe I fell for those erroneous reviews. As a ""gen Xer"" who appreciates 60's, particulary ""hippie"" music, I think this is a very bad melodic and boring album. Sorry boomers, your youthful nostalgia is serving you poorly. Next time I will be more careful when I read the reviews of the geriactric demographic..."
2,Very over rated,"I always thought this was one of the most over rated albums ever. There have been other albums that I've come to appreciate if not love over the years that I didn't care for when they came out but I've just never warmed up to ""Pet Sounds"". It's slow and dreary and by about the sixth or seventh track it all starts to sound alike."
5,Pet Sounds Greatness,"Pet Sounds is the greatest album ever to me. It makes me think why the Beatles are more famous than the Beach Boys. Brian has got to be the greatest song writer in hostory. I especially like ""God Only Knows."" First time I heard it I fell into tears. My favorite song however is ""Wouldn't It Be Nice."" Its been my favorite Beach Boy song of all-time. I guess because I'm 13 and I'm still a kid ,but this song will be in me forever.Pet Sounds has got to be the best album ever. No surfing just feeling. Although the fast songs are great those love songs make the Beach Boys my favorite band. If you haven't heard the album you should and you wouldn't care if you died at that moment. There would be Hell just heaven. I suggest you listen to the album, you'll love. I garentee it."
4,Surprisingly great,"I was a bit hesitant with buying this book at first, since it was based on the movie, but the book covered and described characters and actions that I had always wondered about when watching the movie. Bravo! This will definately become one of the books I go to when I'm in the mood for a good paranormal action."
3,Super Reader,"Movie novelisation, and Ryan certainly has revelled in some parts of the bad monsterness. ""IT'S ALIIVVE..."" etc., so he had fun with those parts. Some of the humour does come through, as well, but he is a little hampered by the source material not being so great. Still, not that bad a job otherwise."
2,cool cars- boring movie,"If you're looking for a movie with cool muscle cars, this is it, If your looking for a movie with a great plot, lots of action, a good story line and believable acting, look elsewhere. Although there are several cool cars shown throughout the movie, there is not enough action. Infact, I was bored at times."
5,2 lane blacktop,A great find. A true classic if you love cars. Awesome views of classic drag racing and its dark underground.
3,"55--great, GTO--slow, Rest of Cast--Fair","This is a movie for those that want to refresh their memory of musclecars--especially of one 55' with a BB-454 w/ 2 AFB carb's running through a Muncie M-22 Rockcrusher. Obviously, the writers in this era were not paid much and it shows in the script/dialogue, but the cars racing make it a movie to watch."
5,Two-Lane Blacktop,"Classic dreamlike film. This is the only movie either James Taylor or Dennis Wilson (who was chosen because he really was a mechanic/not a musician) were in (so I read), but they are wonderful in their parts. And Warren Oates -- love him. In this role, he brings back a little of Ves Painter from Stoney Burke.I wanted to rate this movie four and a half stars, but The Man wouldn't let me."
3,Drag Race for the Mind,"The main draw of this movie is the '55. Anyone who love cars knows what it is to hear and feel a big block run up off the line. This movie is not a masterpiece of movie making. What it does do is allow you to use your imagination and fill in the noticeably absent dialogue. Who are these people? Where are they from? Why are they here? What this movie lacks in theatrical content, it makes up for in deep content."
4,A Holiday Recipe for Every Flavor,This cookbook has a recipe for almost every holiday. It begins on New Years Day and continues with Valentines Day to Labor Day and Thanksgiving and ends with New Years Eve. I found it very helpful. It has a menu plan but there are courses that can be substituted. The recipes are easy to follow and so tasty. I keep this one near by.
4,"Good, but...","Good book, with a slew of old tunes, but if you are a beginning whistler, check out Bill Ochs "" The Clarke Tin Whistle."" Then buy this book. Whistle on!"
5,Everyone deserves to hear this album,This is simply the best music that has ever been recorded. Your life will be better if you buy it.
3,Greg,"Being a fan of progressive ""art rock"" bands like Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, and 70s Genesis, I was excited to discover a truly Christian progressive rock band. I have 4 of Iona's earlier CDs, but shortly after listening to ""The Circling Hour"" I was disappointed. In fact, I sold the CD back to the used CD store. For one thing, the vocals sound weak and lilting when compared to their earlier powerhouses like ""The Book of Kells"", and ""Beyond These Shores."" The lead guitar seems to wandering at times, providing little sense of direction in the music. There are some moments of fine keyboard and piano, but these are few and far between. I've really enjoyed the lengthy, cinematic pieces of music that were present on ""Open Sky"" and the earlier albums, but ""Circling Hour"" does not seem able to capture that which Iona does best. This is not to say the album is without talent--it's just that Iona is capable of much better."
2,Dissapointing and Uninspiring!,"I regret that I have to agree 100% with the reviewer previous that stated this was an dissapointing release by an otherwise amazing band. Iona rehashes a lot of their previous instrumental ideas and there are really no progressive pop hits on this album that trademark previous releases. Joanne singing is weak and breathy, Dave's guitar solos seem a bit sloppy, and overall the production does not seem mixed well."
3,Not as good as I'd expected,"This is a tape of Dave Barry attempting to do standup comedy, and for the most part failing. The tape is only useful for the truly diehard Barry fans who must have everything he puts out. Old material is rehashed, there's a smattering of new stuff but if you're familiar with his work you'll know all the punchlines. Buy it if you can't get enough Barry, but one of his paperbacks or other cassettes would be a better choice for those who don't live and die by the word ""booger"""
3,Challenging,"I find Dan Millman's books easy to read, but with some very powerful messages. He shows through Socrates ""adventures"" how spiritual growth can occur. He illustrates how growth is slow, challenging and frought with many obstacles. One needs to be dedicated, committed and willing to experience whatever it takes to achieve that growth. But this journey is portrayed in an uplifting way. I would recommend all of Millman's books for anyone who would like to embark on a spiritual journey of their own.Dr. Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
1,Tedious,"I picked up this book hoping for a well-researched look at fitness,maybe putting ideas we have today about excercise into a kind of historical context. Instead, I got a superficial look at the history of body building and waaaay too much information on the author's personal fitness routine especially in regards to spinning. This book was a waste of time."
1,A bad and deceptive book,"This is a bad book.Like many other people, I bought it with the erroneous assumption that it would deal with the issue of ultimate fitness. It doesn't. It's a tiresome collection of insipid anecdotes about the author, her boyfriends, her husband, and many others who go about exercising, along with a lot of uninteresting and tedious stories about the history of the exercise and fitness movement.Worse, the author continually touts a proprietary exercise routine called SPINNING. Is she on the payroll of the people behind SPINNING? It certainly seems so, since the boook is written as a marketing brochure for the procedure.A book to avoid."
3,This is worth seeing,"This film was entertaining and has some interesting qualities. Slow in the middle, which I can see would be a big let down for those expecting non-stop horror and don't care for character development in this genre. But the film delivers and makes real the character of the ghost, with a fast-paced final third of the film, which I liked. It's creepy and stayed with me for a few days. I also really enjoyed the humor in the film, especially the scene with the two filmmakers when they realize that their original plans to scare the others is an abysmal failure. It's very funny and real. There is some good acting in this film and an excellent score. Not bad for a micro-low budget indie."
2,hmm.,"Now, I thought Naked (with a few niggling exceptions) was a fine album. This album, however...I mean, especially considering who we're dealing with...is simplistic and poppy and occasionally just plain dumb. It seems like people who'll collectively jump up and down for something like ""Remain In Light"" fall into two distinct group when confronted with this thing (and Naked-) you love it, or just can't see why anyone would rave about it."
3,great product....but polar will getcha in the end,"So, I purchased the F6 in October of 2006. I use it for cycling and on aerobic machines and it really works great. No complaints about performanace at all and it does a nice job of tracking exercise. I paid $99.95 for the product, which seemed sorta high, but I wanted a reliable product from a good name. Well...in August 2007, the transmitter stopped working. Despite the ""2 year"" warranty stated above, that does not cover batteries, which apparently was the transmitter problem. So, I sent it back to Polar to fix it...but they can't fix it, they can only replace it. All said, it cost me $52 plus my shipping costs to fix. The ""replacement"" was clearly not new. I'm not sure if it was mine, but it definitely was not new. So, in less than a year, I've had to shell out about $160 and, if the battery dies again six months from now, I guess I'll have to go through this again. I would not but another Polar product."
1,Good 19 Articles but not a good Book!,"When you buy a book, you expect to read a book that has integrated chapters with smooth flow from one chapter to another. Unfortunately, this book is nothing but 18 articles written by 18 different authors or more and collected under one thing called book. Articles include: Intranet in US Government, Purchase decision, Using spreadsheets as a DSS, IT for SME, Voting solutions in government, IT acceleration in china, etc.!!Unless you're looking for such articles, I recommend you to save your time and money by not buying this book.It's really difficult to find a good book for Managing IT. ..."
1,Worked one time,"This was a Christmas peresent for my grandson. The car worked one time and then would no longer go. It still made the vrooom noise, but would not perform as advertised. The price of the car was not worth haggling over for a new one, but I would definitely discourage the purchase of this product."
5,"Great movie, but..","(...will I get the 1997 ""Italian vourse"" or the 2001 version if I order the movie on DVD?)What I like about this movie is the typical Italian atmosphere. I had seen ""The Bicycle Thief"" only a couple of weeks before, and didn't know anything about this film. So my favourtite scene is maybe the one where the communist watch ""The Bicycle Thief"".This is one of my all-time favourite movies."
2,"Poorly organized, not worth reading.","The Newcomer's Handbook frustrated me repeatedly. Had I looked at it in a store, I never would have bought it.The book is very poorly organized; while there are chapters, the index makes it difficult to find what you're looking for. The editors seem to have assumed that the reader intends to read the entire book from beginning to end; it's not usable as a quick reference guide.Worst of all, the book fails to mention any other written source of information not already published by the same company. If the Newcomer's Handbook for moving to the USA is this bad, they're doing their readers a terrible disservice by mentioning it.I strongly recommend theNot for Tourists Guide to Atlanta 2007 (Not for Tourists)instead. The real estate agent we worked with told us that it's one of the best, and I agree. See my review for that book for more information on why."
4,The Peru Incas reference book,"The Incas and Their Ancestors has a textbook feel and is a good aid to research on the culture. The book is structured around the various periods of history and addresses art, survival, lifestyle and the design of structures and communities. The book is primarily enhanced with black and white photos of Inca art and drawings, although some color photos are included with the book. Drawings of the layouts of communities are helpful for research projects, but would have benefitted from being larger. Bought as a reference book for a school project, it will clearly meet the need, but it is not likely to be picked up for any casual reading!"
4,Handy compilation if you can score it cheap,"OK a forgiving four here, but I'm basing it partly on the fact that I scored it for free with issue 95 of Classic Rock magazine.Tunes here pretty much speak for themselves. Whitesnake, Thunder, Lacuna Coil, Saxon, Alice Cooper and Megadeth are all here and all are represented by a signature tune like da Snakes' Ready an' Willing or Lacuna Coils Our Truth number. A bunch of other mobs like Queensryche and Backyard Babies... well I suppose if your a fan you might enjoy their contributions. But if your a fan then you almost certainly have these tracks already (I know I do). So it's hard to see any real market for the resale of this thing given that bands like Iced Earth and Hawkwind, well their representative tracks don't inspire you to run down to your local record emporium."
1,Poor customer service,"I bought a Sharp Aquos 37"" and experienced a problem in a storm that caused the system to freeze. No big deal I thought because most everything has a reboot sequence.Well, I was right but Sharp charged me $175 to do this because someone had to come to the house to do the magic button sequence.I thought at least spending this much on a Tv that even though it was out of the 12 month warranty since this is a software/firmware issue Sharp would waive the fee.Boy was I wrong.Beware of Sharp Warranty."
4,Great Book,Excellent resource book. I used it as a reference tool for broken families and challenged youths. I feel this book is a resource tool for social workers and case managers alike. Youths and adolences can be challenging to say the least and changes often cause extreme hurdles that need to be addressed accordingly.
1,"History maybe, not Bibliography","I thought I was buying a book like the MLA, or Tarabian book on the proper way to cite references, but this book is nothing useful for College students. Unless you are studying to be a printing expert, because they have all kinds of historical information about different kinds of print face from old England and others."
1,Not worth the read,I found nothing original in this book. Gitomer just rehashes old common sense initiatives. If you're looking for some inspirational reading with regards to customer loyalty then look elsewhere.
5,"Customer Satisfaction is Worthless, Customer Loyalty is Priceless","For anyone who is wanting to keep their customers loyal, you need to read this book and face the challenges. I have been talking about the WOW factor for years and here it is in written form. Invest in this book with your money and committment!"
2,Hyperbole is Worthless - Content is Priceless,"I suppose a certain amount of hyperbole is to be expected in books attempting to motivate and educate readers in customer service, but this book goes way over the top. Most of what can be learned from this book can be found by reading the table of contents, but Jeffrey Gitomer felt the need to belabor each point ad naseum. Gitomer uses catch phrases splashed across pages in big fonts apparently to fill space. He has a certain arrogance that I found distracting. In the final analysis, I found the book valuable in that it reminded me of common sense precepts in establishing and maintaing customer relations. However, for me, it fell way short of the claims on the jacket cover."
5,Don't let your competitor get ahead!,"I am part of franchise that prides itself in Positively Outrageous Service and yet as I took the little self exams in the book I found many areas that were lacking. It was an eye opener for me and I could hardly wait to put the suggestions he had into practice. The results were immediate! Keep ahead of your competition by buying,reading, and implementing the ideas in this book."
2,So So,"This book has some good content, but most is very basic and common sense. It is written in a style that does not go into a lot of detail but summorizes the concepts discussed."
1,The Diet In Reverse,As an experiment I tried Gray's suggestion for men's weight lossand came up with some findings ~ it worked!Try it ladies and seewhat happens.You might be surprized.One diet doesn't fit all ladies or all men as he leads you to believe.Honestly a pseudopop psychologist has no business writing diet books.Find out what works for you as the unique person you are.
5,John Gray has done it again!,"With his The Mars & Venus Diet & Exercise Solution Dr. Gray offers readers the fruit of his compelling research on nutrition and fitness, as well as the insightful practical advice he is known for. This book is a treasured guidebook for a healthier life."
5,"What a relief to have simple, clear directions","What a relief to have someone to do all the chemistry and science and then write simple clear directions about what one needs to do to loose weight! As I started following the directions from this book I started having more and more energy. I just wanted to play more basketball and get more work done because I had the energy for it. It was so encouraging to start feeling like I had more energy. I am a marriage counselor and I recommend it to my couples and families now too.

3,Okay if you like Elmo.,"I was thinking when I saw it on the network, that they were going to be showing a lot of history from Sesame Street. Elmo's World pretty much takes over a lot of the show and you only see very very short clips with Elmo riding in a taxi cab.They have some clips that some may remember growing up for representing the number of the day, which is 10.They have very short clips at the ending that show the years of Sesame Street that some may remember. Like when Mr. Hooper died, when Snuffy became real, and the Hurricane on Sesame Street.I have nothing against the little red monster, but I was expecting a little bit more history, and a little less Elmo. When I was growing up, Big Bird and Oscar and Mister Snuffleupagus were the stars.May Sesame Street have many more years to come. 35 years and one to grow on. ^_^"
1,A Travesty to the memory of Sesame Street,"Ok, I know that as an 18 year old I should not have gone out and bought it. But I did. Everything I had read or heard about it led me to believe that it was a retrospective. It even says 35th Anniversary Special on the case. Once you watch it though, you realize that it is one giant plug for the little red beast who ruined a really good seires, Elmo. There was almost no reminiscence in the episode. You got five minutes at the end, with only a brief little blur that could have been Mr. Hooper. For a show that taught children how to deal with a lot of difficult issues, and where everything turned out okey-dokey in the end, this was a highly disapointing video. Parents, think twice before you support a show that is no longer what it used to be in it's glory days. Everyone else, don't even touch this, it isn't worth it."
5,Raw foodism has never been more clearly explained in detail!,"David's book is packed full of information that everyone can learn by. The best part of the book was the detailed explanation of the three food groups a raw foodist should eat from to attain and keep the body functioning at its most optimal level. If you want to know everything you possibly would need to know to follow a raw food diet, this is the book! For beginner's, the best part of the book would be how to slowly transition from a Standard American Diet to a raw food diet. Excellent step-by-step hints and suggestions."
1,Misleading title,"Title say Gourmet... The author is really flattering herself by calling this gourmet. If you know how to take salad out of the bag and put aminos on it, you indeed are gourmet chef like her!Recipes are so primitive and not tasty at all. It is all just pretty pictures with no substance whatsoever.This is not book, it is some sort of magazine format, cheap, cheap. However it is priced as book. I would like to give this away to somebody, too bad I did not return it immediately. Be aware. This is for somebody who is just discovering fresh produce in supermarket."
4,"Heavy on the pics, light on the science","This book is good for the pics. I have not tried any recipes yet. The equipment is way too expensive and out of my budget for the next few months. They look good though!Shannon is very light on the science. All the raw food books in the bookstore (Barnes and Noble, Borders) make the claim that 'we need enzymes to help digest food' (page 3). The human stomach contains an acid that aids in digestion. This acid would render the live enzymes inactive therefore defeating the purpose of eating raw food for the enzymes! I agree that incorporating more foods in their natural state is beneficial, but this raw food movement needs to have a registerd dietician write a book, then I will believe all the hocus pocus."
2,Disappointing,"It looked little and cute and seemed like it would do the job, and while it is comfortable and light-weight...it can't switch ears, which I had assumed it would for some reason, and it's also not bright enough. For a dimly lit room maybe....but when I got home and turned out the lights to test it out, even with the big ole tv going, It was barely enough to light the page dimly. That and if I moved my head too much to follow the words (big book), the light went OFF the page. Upside, it was cheap."
5,Essential Spanish guide,Madrigal is the essential Spanish guide for all students of Spanish. You will refer to this book often in your studies.
5,One of the best for learning Spanish,I have learned more Spanish using this book than other books I have purchased over the years. Recommended highly. I'm thinking of purchasing the Kindle version for reference
5,Madrigal's Magic Key to Spanish,I would recommend this book to anyone serious about learning Spanish. This is one of the better books on learning Spanish that I came across. This book makes the job so easy and logical.
2,Madrigal's Magic Key to Spanish,"First a minor quibble: the book is NOT by Andy Warhol, as the product blurb on Amazon indicates. The illustrations are line drawings by Mr. Warhol. As far as the book itself goes, it seems to be based on the concept that one can learn Spanish by learning the English-Spanish cognates - essentially memorizing long lists of words that are similar to their English counterparts. It doesn't spend much time on the structure of the language - at least, not initially. Different people have different ways of learning, but that doesn't work for me. The book might be valuable as an additional resource in the learning process."
5,so easy to learn using this book,it's so easy to learn using this book - the way she has it. you read it & instead of studying you just read and all of the sudden you are able to speak spanish a little. the more you read the more you learn. it's awesome. I wish she'd write one for every language!
3,It's a pretty good book if you've had some Spanish before,"This book has some good material in it and you can learn a lot of words, but it is not something I would recommend as a first book to learn Spanish from. I had been doing Roseta Stone for a while so I had some familiarity with Spanish phrases so for me this is a helpful book. But again, if I was thinking of trying to learn spanish from a book I don't think this would be my first choice. I guess it depends on how you learn."
2,Not very pleased,"I have purchased many books about the extroardinary things and origins of things in everyday life. I thought this book was very boring, and not very interesting. This is comparing this book to others in the same category like ""What Makes Flamingos Pink"" and ""Extroardinary Origins of Everyday Things"". Purchase those two books first, then if you still desire more information, maybe think about purchasing this book."
2,"Great title and cover art, but the book fizzled out - FAST !","I was very disappointed in this book, mostly because his previous book ""Spencerville"" really stuck. I was looking forward to this book very much, but the main character really bothered me because of his sarcastic attitude and lousy sense of humor. It's a poor retelling of The General's Daughter; a much superior novel."
2,Should get &#65533;the most obnoxious main character&#65533; prize.,"Lack of suspense coupled with the totally obnoxious ""hero"" of the story is way out of line with other Demille books that I`ve read. I'm glad that I only borrowed this book."
4,Comments on the audio book version,"1) The reader of the audio book was OK as far as depicting when different characters were talking. But, he sounded like what I imagine John Corey sounding like which was great...especially durning the funny lines.2) Yes, I did laugh out loud a few times...I enjoyed the humor very much.3) The four hours of tape kept me interested because I had no preconceptions of what to expect. I didn't expect a thriller with lots of chases but simply a NY Cop uncovers a government cover-up. This wasn't the case and the simplistic plot allowed me to enjoy the characters more.4) Complaint #1 - Geez, didn't know sex with strangers was that easy nowadays.5) Complaint #2 - What is up with bad guys telling their plans first then shooting later? Then again how many stories have I read with the hot tempered warrior type or the serial killer who was abused as a child?!?6) Enjoyable story...at one point I wished I had not listened to the audio version but had read the book instead."
2,First and Last,This is the first book that I have attemptedto read by this author. For the first 40 percent ofthe book he was desccribing Plum Island and in toomuch detail. I didn't stick around to find outwho murdered the victims or why. Waste of time.
2,slow murder mystery,"The plot line was interesting enough and the author has a nice style. But I found that I could have put the book down at any time. It wasn't tight enough; it was a bit slow. Overall, it was disappointing. I was looking for a fun book, a fast read. Something light and fun for a change. This wasn't it. I slogged through till the end, but never really engaged with any of the characters."
2,Excellent beginning but not consistent to the end.,"This is one of my favorite authors. The book started out with his usual excellent storytelling. But, about halfway through, it is like a totally different author began. Very disappointing last half of the book."
2,Very disappointing!,"I certainly hope Nelson Demille is not turning into another novel machine, although it would appear otherwise. His last two efforts have left me wondering why I bothered to read them. Plum Island has its fun moments, but mostly I found it to be a silly, predictable novel. The main character of the story, John Corey, comes across as a chauvinistic smart aleck. Occasionally his humor is well placed and sparks a laugh, but mostly he comes across as a wisecracking, sarcastic know it all. The story is far fetched, and the characters lack depth. I think what makes this novel even more disappointing is knowing Mr. DeMille can and has written far better"
1,Don't waste your time,"While the author grabs your attention at the beginning he seems to have lost interest (like myself) in the middle of the book. If it were not for it being my first Kindle book I would have put it down. The plot change mid narrative is just stupid and overworked.Pirate treasure? Give me a break. I kept hoping he would lose the pirates and salvage the book. It never happened.While I like cop humor the author has dumbed down Corey's sense of it to the middle school level.(sorry kids). Also, while the last third of the book picks up in action, the actions of the protagonist are unreasonable, unbelievable (yes I know its ficton)and outright disgusting. He is no hero with honor - fictional or not. The sad thing is that the author set the stage for what could have been an absolutely riveting novel and seems to have just gotten lazy. Perhaps the publisher was on his back for a first draft. Whatever... read something else."
1,Save your time and money,"This is the first novel I have read featuring Detective Corey, and will frankly be my last. I found the plot and actions of the characters to be extremely unrealistic. The book dragged in so many places, and left me wanting less! I read the whole book as I hate to leave books unfinished and it helped me fall asleep, but on the whole I thought it was a waste of time."
4,"Entertaining, not great","I was somewhat disappointed in this novel, because of the previous high-calibre works by Mr. DeMille. It certainly is not his best book, but the main character IS likeable and the writing is tight. Its biggest flaw seems to be a forced plot."
2,Needed a good editor,"Longer than it needed to be. The reason for the murders was explained over and over by the main character. ( We get it, already! ) Cardboard characters I cared little about, with an obnoxious main character. Very llittle to recommend."
5,Great book!,This book is a fast paced action book with sarcastic humor mixed in. Its a great start to a great seried. Loved it!
3,Plum Island Book Review 2012,"I enjoyed this book and although it was a ""murder-mystery"" at times I found myself laughing aloud at main character's sense of humor. It was an easy read and came about with an unexpected motive which is always a nice touch. I would recommend it to a friend."
4,Plum Island,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book! Lots of detail, twists and turns. I've read his books before and have enjoyed all of them. Enjoy!"
1,Overcooked Cynicism can only make a writer worse,"""Are you John?"" ""None other."" How could a person answered a stranger like that? How could John Corey could become a detective if all he could do was jerking around to other people in a murder case with a totally unrealistic and absurd attitude? The writing is so loose that until page 100, the jerk detective could only find an ice box was missing on the victims' boat. We only read lot of unnecessary and extremely absurd dialogues between or among unfamiliar people. This time, Demille was totally lost and become a overkilled cynical melodrama writer as unapproriate as the hero, John Corey, as he created. I regret to find all the dialogues in this book were just like adding hollow bricks. A book which could be finished under 250 pages being ballooned into a farce over 500 pages. Such a terrible way to waste the precious paper material"
2,"Great start, stutters and falls","My first Demille's book and it was recommended to me by a lady .. she had'nt read this book either, but had apparently read others and said ""This guy writes well"".I thought I'd made the right choice and really liked the book - at first. I recommended the book to lots of people and even presented the book to a colleague who was leaving us. Around the 250th page or so, the author begins to lose focus and it becomes quite a chore to finish the book. There is no element of suspense and the book just drags along.As another on-line reviewer had mentioned, there's ample scope for Bruce Willis to display his wares !I do like his language and his ""sexist"" humour and caught myself unabashedly smiling and laughing at times. I'll definitely try and read one other book of his."
3,"Interesting, but not for serious mystery readers.","Yes, I was there. I am one of the few who set foot on Plum Island, 7 years of my life as a research scientist in those laboratories. The author's descriptions of the island, its history, its facilities along with the North Fork are quite accurate. Lots of pleasant and exciting memories.But I must give this book only a six. It is easy to read, fast paced and has sufficient tension to provide an eagerness to read on. However, there are a few negatives: 1) the unnecessary, filthy language to titilate the unimaginative reader; 2) the lack of adequately developed alternatives (and misleading clues)for identifying the murderer [this is definitely not an Agatha Cristie novel]; and 3) a few entirely predictable events, interactions and dialogs. I am convinced this would make an exciting Harrison Ford movie with the bumbling bureaucrats, sinister sycophants, and scared scientists. Enjoy if you will."
5,"Plum Island is a ""plum"" of a book (Sorry)","If I read one more review complaining about John Corey's ""sexism"", ""ageism"" or general misanthropism, I'm going to give up on American Civilization. You know, it's okay to tell the truth about events and people around you and that's exactly what Corey does. That's what makes him an interesting character: who else, in this ultrasensitive day and age, has the gumption to do that? In any case, if you haven't read Plum Island, read it. It is, despite what some others have said, MUCH BETTER than whatever tripe John Grisham has published. Whatever you may think of John Corey, at least he never mentioned the Cayman Islands"
5,Could not stop laughing; could not put it down,"No spoilers. This is one of my favorite books of all. I love John Corey; he makes me laugh so much (and there were times when I nearly cried too). The descriptions of the north shore of Long Island out in Suffolk County are accurate (it's really beautiful out there), and the characters are believable (mostly) and well-developed. This was the first book by DeMille I ever read and since then I've read everything else he wrote. I still think this book is his best and John Corey (in this book) his best creation."
4,"Great start, weak finish","Demille does a great job of creating the hero of the book and setting him up as a believable and sympathetic character. But, the rest of the players are plastic. The love interest ends up as a dissapointing one night stand. The resolution of a complicated plot start is a bit simplistic, like he couldn't think of any interesting twists to the plot once he created it. When the plot unfolded and had its real denoument, I thought it was a red herring. It wasn't, and I was disappointed.But, the writing is lucid and captivating. A great book for airports, long flight delays, or just a lazy summer weekend."
2,Not his best.,"I was disappointed. I was expecting a great read like the ""Gold Coast"". The story showed promise in the beginning. Unfortunately, the story took an unbelievable turn into pure fantasy. Toward the end of the exhausting story, Mr. Demille throws in a hurricane. Every trick in the book was tried, just doesn't work with ""Plum Island"""
4,Perfect summer reading,"""Plum Island"" is my first exposure to Nelson Demille's writing. I enjoyed the easy flow of the book, was perfectly content to let Mr. Demille take me anywhere he wanted and yes, the main character has some chavaunistic traits but I forgave him. The humor was..... humorous. The connection to a real place and the geographical references made me refer to my Atlas. It was like, wow, there is a Plum Island, Mattituck, Cutchoge and soforth. I knew my husband would enjoy the book and I wouldn't mind my 13 year old reading it. As a Tom Clancy fan, I relished the brevity of ""Plum Island"" and the lack of major details but was entertained none the less. You want to be entertained? Read ""Plum Island"". I have started ""The General's Daughter"" where the male lead certainly reminds me of Mr. Corey from P.Is. but that's OK. Rebecca Gree"
5,Highly Entertained Throughout,"This was my first DeMille novel, but it won't be my last. I have never read a mystery/thriller where the detective was more sarcastic and/or funny than John Corey. I encourage everyone to pick up this book, but beware, after a few pages there won't be any turning back."
2,Fun till the ridiculous end,"Plum Island started out well. A convalescent policeman becomes involved in an odd murder investigation. He becomes interested in an intelligent policewoman. Then he starts to get macho. The ending is beyond belief. Although Mr. Macho claims to know little about boats, he takes a speedboat out into the turbulent waters between the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean during a hurricane. And he has a couple of beers while doing so. The supposedly sensible policewoman goes along and is mightily impressed. Ugh. Then it gets sillier. I was, in the end, quite disappointed."
2,What a bore!,"I have read most of Mr. Demille's works and totally enjoyed GOLD COAST and THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER. PLUM ISLAND is a disaster! It seems as if the author is trying to create a ""gum shoe"" of the 40's and 50's but fails dismally. John Corey, the NYPD detective, is all smart mouth. For pages on pages on pages, NOTHING HAPPENS. Then, maybe, a clue. All of a sudden, this smart mouth becomes the greatest detective on earth. Too much talk and smart remarks and too little action and plot. If Demille is tyring to make John Corey the ""gum shoe"" of the 90's, I'm not buying"
5,Just happened to pick up at the local library!,"This book was a great find! One of my fav writers recommended it, so I deceided to give it a try...it was so worth it!!! I am moving on to the Gold Coast, but don't miss Plum Island!!! It was a well written story, with a great main character!"
4,Great Story - Poor Condition,Title tells the story. Really enjoyed the author and want to see more of him. The condition of the book was disappointing. Looked like it had been lightly read - by half the frat house.
4,Not my favorite,"I am a huge Van Morrison fan, and really like most the songs on this CD, but they are not my favorite version of the songs. A lot of the songs are live, and I expected the studio versions."
1,Don't waste your time - for the faint of heart only,"And don't let the ""XXXtra hot"" fool you. I was so disappointed I had to try it a second time, and that confirms it - this sauce is lacking in both heat and flavor. Less of either one than Tabasco, for example, let alone many serious hot sauces that don't brag about their heat. It's also runny, lumpy and seedy. They do deserve credit for not using a stupid or obscene pun for a name."
5,Excellent description of angels,This book thoroughly covers all the levels of angels and what they do. Leaves no unanswered questions.
2,This book is wrong,"This book only has about 50% right about angels, the rest is wrong. One reason I think this is because she says that a person with no gaurdian angel is a dark entity, and I don't have one, but I'm certainly not a dark entity! There are plenty of people I know who don't have a guardian angel and are not dark entities!Also, angels do have personalities,they have emotions like us! They could also take the form of anything, even how thay look like without wings.So, Sylvia Browne only understands little about angels."
2,1 Sided,This book had some good information about the history ofM.S. but was very 1 sided. If you want to read 256 pages about whyM.S. and all of it's people are far better then the rest of the world and everyone else is stupid including the government for looking at the way M.S. does business then this is the book for you.
3,Repetition of his standup,"If you have never heard Foxworthy's standup routine, this book will be hilarious. For those who have heard or seen his routine, most of the book is a repeat with personal stories mixed in. See Blue Collar Comedy Tour for Foxworthy and others."
5,This were a meaningful book,"This book were powerful, but weren't nearly as powerful nor timely-esque as mine watch which i doth referreth to as los mannacle singularo!"
5,Excellent! but why so expensive?,"One complaint many people have with Tai Ch'i DVDs is that the camera either faces the instructor (so you have to reverse the arm or leg and movement in question) or the camera view focused on the instructor's back -- while you can follow the direction, you can't see the detail of the movement being executed. This DVD provides both views, plus a segment that shows each movement in slo-mo, as well as executed at regular speed. The practitioner obviously knows his stuff, and the Chinese scenery background and music make for a fun and ""authentic"" experience. I think you can learn the form in a week or so, if you analyze the moves and practice. Of course, perfecting the form may take much longer! The essential value of this DVD is getting you right into the form, without wasting time. However, I don't know why it's so expensive -- when I bought mine thru Amazon 1.5 yrs ago, it was something like $25.00. I can't recommend buying it at this price -- look elsewhere."
2,I don't like it,It is not well explained. and the slow motion is too exhausted to follow a long.The flash does not help either.The forms were ok. that is the only worthy part of it
3,Spray Bottle only - no oil inside,I got this spray bottle thinking it had oil in it but it is empty it is just a spray bottle.
4,E.Lynn's Done it again!!!,"Another hit with a different twist. This one reads almost like a suspense novel-trying to find out ""who done it"". Will they get busted? Will anyone find out the truth? Will Basil beat ol' boy down?!?!?! LOL Of course it's built on triangles and steeped in revenge. It doesn't disappoint. I can't wait for the next one!!!!!"
4,Loved it!,E. Lynn does it again. This book was fast moving and very entertaining. Keep up the good work.
2,I hate to say this but...,"I've read every one of Mr. Harris' books and have loved them all. They've made me laugh, cry and everything in between. I could really feel the characters. However, with ""Not A Day Goes By"" I felt the characters a little TOO much. They are both so self centered and childish, I couldn't wait to finish the book so I'd be done with them. They both deserved what they got in the end. I hope that if there is a sequel there will be some sort of epiphany for both to help them become real people and give them some redeeming qualities or I will just have to give up on them altogether. Bring back Raymond, will ya? At least he's a decent human being. Yancey and Basil don't deserve a second thought."
5,Leave you wanting more!,Mr. Harris has done it again with Basil and the trials and errors in his life. But Mr.Harris makes you long for more of Basil and if he will ever find what he is looking for. But at this end of this book you know that Basil is just the bad boy that you want. This book was a quick read and have you longing for the next page. Great book again and hat's off to E. Lynn Harris.
5,"""A DAY GOES BY"" very quickly!","NOT A DAY GOES BY was a fitting ending to the Basil Henderson-Yancy Braxton relationship where the big payoff was not in the malicious throwing of barbs and blackmail that I was relishing, but the cold, hard reality of the life you are living coming back to stare you in the face through the eyes of the one you love the most. It was poinant and memorable, and I can't believe that I read it all in two days! Yeah, it was a short book, but still.... Hey E., got a new idea for you! Instead of concentrating on the recurring cast of characters, how we go in a totally new direction and start on Ava? That chick got enough issues to put PEOPLE MAGAZINE out of business! Think about it!"
5,Caution! This Book is laced with super glue!,"When you pick up this novel, you won't be able to put it down!Both Yancey and Basil have some SERIOUS issues! These two severely damaged people want to unite as one in holy matrimony. How they choose to deal with their individual issues make up a great story. Lies, secrets, deception and the past all add up to complications galore for this engaged couple. Will they make it to the altar and become a mended pair? Should they? This is a must read. The Yancey-Basil roller coaster ride is exciting from beginning to end...There are no straight tracks on this ride!"
4,Who do you love? Who can you trust?,"Ava and Yancy are two of a kind. Basil is the victim here, but he is in rare form, he never will let you get him in a catch 22. Ava is the best actress in a leading roll and Yancy is the best supporting actress in this story. You will not believe the women here. It is too bad that Yancy didn't love Basil enough to turn him around, and it is too bad that Basil was smart enough to know the signs of a performance to do what he has to do to find out what Yancy is really up to. Now it is sad that he ultimately gets hurt, he's confused enough, but I am so glad that they didn't get to bring the curtain down in their performance, because Basil set the stage. I am hungry to read the continuation of the saga with ""Any way the wind blows."" Because Basil is back with his ""Phine....self"" but my goodness all that man, and he is switchin lanes, Have Mercy.. You never know. Don't let the Physique fool you. Ladies you better look behind.... (must read!)"
5,Best Ever,By far this is the best novel the E.Lynn Harris has written. It took me 2 days to complete this novel and the only disapointment that I felt was that I was finished within two days. I enjoyed the way the novel switched the narrative on Basil and Yancey so that readers could get a feel of what they both were going through at the same time. By making Basil's personality a little softer he allows the readers to feel comfortable when taking his side on several issues which in his previous novels Basil is the person that we all love to hate but cannot resist.
3,Scandelous,"A very interesting tale to say the least. It was nice to see Basil acting like a human being instead of the dog that most of us know him to be. However, I would have liked a little more story.The novel has plenty of drama that will keep you turning the pages, but very little substance. Maybe it wasn't supposed to?Buy it. Read it. You'll find Not a Day Goes By amusing."
5,Another Masterpiece,E.Lynn Harris is a genius.He just keeps getting better and better.I can't wait to read his next book.He is definitely my favorite author!
4,Great Book!,"I read this book over the course of two days and E. Lynn Harris has managed to churn out yet another great novel!From beginning to end you never knew what to expect. Of course you try to guess, but nine times out of ten you would be wrong.I can't wait for the next E. Lynn masterpiece!"
1,Actually No Stars,"This book is so stupid, it defies description. Why in the world any publisher would be interested in it is a mystery in itself. ""Beefy finger""? ugh"
4,Pretty Good Little Sauce,Don't get this sauce if you want a scolding fire in your mouth. This is a very mild hot sauce like Franks or Tabasco. Its got a good flavor and gives you just a little kick to let you know its there.
4,"In the same vein as ""Love at First Bite"" and ""Once Bitten""","If you like the aforementioned movies, you'll like this one.Krysten and Alicia have good chemistry together, think Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson in Wedding Crashers or ""Romy & Michelle""."
3,Maybe if you're a young teen,"What can I say? I watched the movie for Dan Stevens. It's a silly movie apt for a teenager audience. Surprisingly, Sigourney Weaver is hilarious in this flick."
3,It's Okay,"Not great, but a decent diversion. It's amusing in a ""generates smiles"" rather than in a big laugh kind of way."
3,"Campy, but fun.","My friend and I played this in the background while we did our nails and toenails, and it was a good movie for that kind of half paying attention type viewing. If you don't like movies that are cheesy and a bit silly, then you won't like this movie. If you have a more forgiving sense of humor, it's cute. I'm not gonna buy it or anything, but I got a few good laughs out of it. It was fun."
2,Peachtree 2008,Peachtree 2008 is difficult to use in simple applications. The 2000 version is easier for simple applications. The initial screen has part of the writing partially blanked out. It is difficult to write a single check.Roy Huckaby CPA
1,Black Head Removal yeah right,"Either i dont have any black heads on my face or this thing is not doing what it is supposed to do. If you dont have huge, blinking black heads you are probably better of with a bar of soap and warm water. I used this product to remove the black heads but it didnt do the trick so i ended up buying the sticky pads and removed the black heads."
5,Cold War cat-and-mouse game,"In THE BEDFORD INCIDENT, a news reporter (Poitier) granted an interview with a US Navy destroyer captain (Widmark) is first-hand witness to unexpected war games between this ship and a Russian submarine.A fine adaptation of Mark Rascovich's novel and a good cast ably directed by James B. Harris make this Cold War drama one of the very best of its kind. Highest recommendation.""Bedford Incident"" is avalable onDVD.Also recommended:Sidney Lumet's FAIL-SAFE (1964) is the story of an American president who must do the unthinkable when a nuclear strike is accidentally launched against Moscow. (VHS) (DVD)Parenthetical number preceding title is a imdb 1 to 10 viewer poll rating.(7.5) The Bedford Incident (1965) - Richard Widmark/Sidney Poitier/James MacArthur/Martin Balsam/Wally Cox/Donald Sutherland (cameo)"
4,Let's Play Chicken -- With Nuclear Weapons,"This film takes place during the Cold War era, but it is still a possibility today for American and Russian warships.It is definitely Richard Widmark's film. Although Sidney Poitier has co-billing, he does not bring his high level of performance to the part. His classic mannerisms (see ""To Sir With Love"", or ""In The Heat Of The Night"", etc.) are absent in this film. As a matter of fact, he under-plays his role as a journalist -- and not for the better. Any B-List actor could have been cast in his part without a loss to the tension the film builds.Other than that minor casting complaint, the film is an excellent ""let's play chicken"" thriller."
5,Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 5000 Key board & mouse combo,I Really like this setup. I looked at the 6000 and the mouse just did not feel right since I am used to the explorer mouse.The side buttons on the 6000 seem like they are hard to reach with your thumb.If you liked the older explorer style wireless mouse you will like this.I also had the MS internet keyboard Pro and this keyboard has a lot more features.Buttons were real easy to setup for different program favorites.I am happy.
1,Waste of money,"Used for two days, and like everyone said.. Keyboard has a repeat problem eventhough the reciever is RIGHT near it, with brand new batteries. The mouse feels not so comfy and middle button clicking is very hard.I've used the same mouse before, but I did not know it was this exact mouse, untill I bought it. Horrific mouse, and keyboard doesn't work when typing fast. Read other online reviews from other place than Amazon to see its unusefulness.I've stopped using after 2 days. Keyboard problem exists when using USB or P2 port. Mouse has its engineering problem."
5,My 2-yr-old wakes up asking for this car!,"He loves this great little car! It's a simple concept, just shaking the car makes it make ever increasing reving noises. Then put it down and it goes...farther the more you shake it. He can't get enough of it, and either can his buddy down the street. His favorite birthday present!"
2,Confusing,"I am a huge fan of Michelle Dozois, but unfortunately didn't like this workout at all. I thought the steps were very confusing, and would take me quite a while to master. I think this workout would be fine if you really enjoy dance style aerobics, but if you are looking for more straight forward aerobics, this isn't the workout for you. I think Shape had a good idea as far as the format, set, music, and overall production quality, I just wish this would have been a non-dance style aerobics workout. Hopefully, they'll come out with something like that for us non-dancers!"
3,Easy,All the videos are the same in my opinion. The hardest part of any of them is motivating yourself to actually do it
5,Metro is a BRILLIANT song...,"Though I'm not familiar with when this single was released (it must have been some time before the album ""Toxicity"" was released, however) but I must say that the 2 included songs, Metro and Marmalade completely blew me away. Metro has to be one of the saddest songs ever, but at the same time I really happen to like the beat.This is rather expensive for a single, but if you have never heard Metro or Marmalade, pick it up. Now. I'll wait..."
5,Maggie Shayne,she cant do wrong. great series and a definate must in my library have read this series 3 seperate times.
4,Carnegie solves a murder and saves her business,"Set in Seattle, this Carnegie Kincaid mystery starts out at a wedding that Carnegie has planned. Everything is going well until a drunken bridesmaid steals the keys of another bridesmaid(Carnegie's next client} and crashes her classic Mustang into a wall, killing herself instantly. Carnegie is overcome with guilt and anxiety over the future of her business, especially since it appears that her next client, the daughter of a very wealthy man, has many dangerous enemies who just might make his daughter, Nikki, their target.I initially was a little skeptical that a mystery about weddings and their planner would hold my interest, but I was pleasantly surprised. The characters are very real, and I didn't figure out the mystery until the very end. Very good mystery."
4,My son read this book at least 10 times!,"He started reading it in 5th grade and I had hidden it on several occasions because he was staying up too late reading the same book.Four years later he knows more than most teens and is taking Geopolitics this summer.I had wondered how he had aced his History SOL in past years, so when I found him reading his dogeared copy a few weeks ago he told me this book had ignited his interest in History and Politics. So I would encourage a parent who wants their child to become interested in History,just buy a copy and leave it around.Of course you may never get it back!"
1,Don't Know Much About the History of the Mexican Revolution,"The section on Pancho Villa was filled with factual inaccuracies, especially about Zapata, whom the book falsely claimed was one of Carranza's generals during the Mexican revolution. Wrong! Both Villa and Obregon were, but NOT Zapata who battled against Carranza, and was eventually assassinated on then President Carranza's orders. Also, dismissing Villa as simply a ""bandit"" and Zapata as ""an illiterate Indian"" is both WRONG and INSULTING to their true historical legacies. Seriously, were there no fact checkers for this book!?!Source: Mexico: A Brief History by Alicia Hernandez Chavez"
2,One man's opinion - a honest review,"This book should be called how America is a racist country. Don't Know Much About History : Everything You Need to Know About American History but Never Learned exploits every aspect of American History into a racial point of view. It does little to go in detail about some exciting American events, but focuses on a country's past mistakes of slavery, segregation, & discrimination. The author stepped around certain interesting subjects and steered more towards these topics. However, the narrator does an excellent job of bringing the subject up-front, clear and concise. Overall, I did learn much about American History and injustices that were unfolded throughout the ages."
4,Interesting and informative book,"Enjoyed the book cover to cover. For a person not having read American History before, this was an Executive Summary of sort!Definitely a recommended book for those who are in search of information about American History."
3,Just because it's written in a book doesn't make it true,"Though the book gives a good generalized look at American history, it has a definite political slant that obfuscates some of the facts. In writing a book that purports to be history, I find this nearly inexcusable.Other than that, the book provides a thorough and readable account of even the darker sides of our past. Worth reading, but don't take it _all_ as indisputable fact."
4,"Informative & entertaining, but a skewed view of history with lots of gaps.","First off, I think this would be a fine choice for required reading in our schools and is an entertaining read for the general public.Perhaps the book's main shortcoming is that it presents a strong ""liberal"" slant on history. I happen to agree with a lot it, but if there's a comparable ""conservative"" slant book they would make a good pair.My other issue, which I suppose is hard to overcome with any single book, is the tendency of the author to bring up terms or situations that he doesn't define. As an example, in the section on the Vietnam war I didn't see where he discussed the difference between the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese. So unless you already know, or look it up elsewhere, you're left hanging.Overall, I really liked this book, but can't quite give it 5 stars."
2,"Should be called ""Don't know much about NEGATIVE History""","This book is very informative but the author is almost un-American in the way he skims over America's great accomplishments while concentrating mainly on it's moral shortcomings.He is very liberal in his thinking and it shows in his book. He is also very cynical about human intentions, always pointing out negative reasons for an action. For example, he tells us the first world war was about ""Empire Building,"" which was not the original cause of the war. He also indicates that the United States entered the war for profit. I am sure some people stood to profit but I highly doubt that was the main reason.This information in this book is worth reading but combine it with other research if you want the whole picture."
1,A Built-In Bias Book,"In terms of objectivity, this book has little to offer. Bias in the modern sections is easily spotted. Read the sections that describe Ronald Reagan as an incompetent dolt and Bill Clinton as a brilliant but flawed politician. If his bias is so readily apparent in these modern passages, then what kind of bias is probable in sections where a reader is less able to discern his 'slant' on history to suit hisown agenda. Historians should offer up facts and figures and weave from a variety of sources to come up with a solid profile of history. Davis has an ax to grind for the liberal camp. At the end of the book, he refers to Howard Zinn, a hard left historian, who offers a 'necessary corrective' in his books.If you're looking for history books, keep looking."
2,Should I trust any of it??,"The notion of a complete history of the USA broken up into small segments is a great idea. Call it the Readers Digest for history, or call it a bathroom book. But other reviewers are correct about the bias. I'd rather have the same pages devoted to just what happened and how, rather than guessing at why.I found it ironic that the author found a way to criticize both choices that leaders could make. For example, he criticizes ""big business"" for dragging the US into a war with Spain. Then he criticizes Henry Ford for being an isolationist before WWII.Overall, I'd recommend the first half of the book."
1,Entertaining for its Obvious Bias,"In terms of objectivity, this book has little to offer. Bias in the modern sections is easily spotted. Read the sections that describe Ronald Reagan as an incompetent dolt and Bill Clinton as a brilliant but flawed politician. If his bias is so readily apparent in these modern passages, then what kind of bias is probable in sections where a reader is less able to discern his 'slant' on history to suit hisown agenda. Historians should offer up facts and figures and weave from a variety of sources to come up with a solid profile of history. Davis has an ax to grind for the liberal camp. At the end of the book, he refers to Howard Zinn, a hard left historian, who offers a 'necessary corrective' in his books.If you're looking for history books, keep looking."
5,Amazing book,"Best book for a history major. I used it to pass the United States History AP test, and the book had everything that was on the test. The book gives you both sides of the arguement, and tells history how it was, not with a bias, like textbooks."
5,good read,Simple read.no confusion on chapters. A lot more interesting than a high school history class. Real information from real sources
2,Don't Know Much About My Politically Correct Viewpoint,"I listened to this book on tape. While the first several chapterswere very entertaining and informative, it becomes quite apparentthat his review of the last 100 years is more of a political statement than an unbiased historical review.For this reason, I would not recommend this book to young students. I would be curious if he keeps the same slant going in his other books, particularly his review of the Bible. I gave it two stars only because I thought his discussion of the Revolutionary period was excellent."
2,History with a twist.,"History with a twist. Any opportunity to color a conservative in a more negative light is done with extra time and detail in this work. Overall, there are some interesting ""facts"" presented but this seems to be more of a liberal leaning Opinion Editorial than a accurate historical account of the selected topics in American history. After a few subjects, you can accurately predict which angle he is going to take or which ""facts"" will be emphasized before he even gets there. He does do it gently, though. I'd love to see this guy go head-to-head with a more unbiased historian. A good example of how subtle bias can be infused into history - and here be presented as historical ""fact""."
3,Not interely accurate,"Mr. Davis' Don't Know Much About books are fun to read and enlightening, however there are not just a few deviations from fact, especially in this book and his Civil War book. I enjoyed reading them but they should not be taken for the ""end all - be all"". Some further research is advised."
5,Satisfying Stanwyck flick,"OK, it's basically a soap opera set in a California cannery town, and if lesser actors were in it, it wouldn't be worth recommending. But Barbara Stanwyck and Paul Douglas are just so good as Mae Doyle, the returning local girl who didn't quite succeed, and Joe, her lonely former schoolmate, a local mensch fisherman who never left town and never quite forgot her.Nothing really deep here. Just get into your jammies, open a box of bonbons, andsettle back happily to see Stanwyck, Douglas, Ryan and Monroe do their stuff."
5,At long last available to the public,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, as I never seen it before. Marilyn stars as a factory worker in a fishing village. Her appearance is really sparkling and definitely holds up next to her later work. The story line leaves enough room for all of the actors to stand out. The quality of the material is unexpected fine. As I live in Europe, I regret there are only subtitles in English, French and Spanish, but that didn't keep me from enjoying this movie (and surely won't keep me from seeing it again, and again...)."
3,Film Noir or just melodrama !,"To often great european film makers and some americans as well are turn to mush by the hollywood system. Is this the same directer of 'Metropolis' 'M'. ?Only William Wyler could have lifted this play to great film making, if that! Theover the top performances are good if not entirely believable. Talk about throwing out the baby with the bath water. The baby is no more than a prop!! The camera work is stiff and the characters walk on and off the camera like a broadway play. The running commentary is forced. It's a good women's movie and for that I give it three stars. If you want powerhouse film noir see 'Raw Deal or 'Detour'"
2,I didn't find this book useful at all,"A lot of pages filled with black-and-white large text, lots of white space... and very little design. If you need help thinking through the design process, this might be for you, but if you've already done any kind of interior design or remodeling, you'll want a different book. Unless, of course, you failed miserably and want to go back to basics."
4,Intriguing Buffy tale...,"This is an an intriguing, well written Buffy novella by the soon to be former creative team of the Buffy comic book.There's a new vamp in town, and he's got a plan to get the ultimate blood high. add to this the undercurrents of subplot from the jsut-finished sxith season of the tv show, and this is an enjoyable quick read. FYI: There is also a sequel to this story: issue #46 of the ongoing Buffy comic series."
1,Hippy-Dippy wisdom,"""When you claim well documented prior spiritual thoughts to be your own it only diminishes your credibility. I wish Tolle provided appropriate references - such as the Upanishads, the Gita, the Kashmir Shaivism, the Dhammapada and the Vigyana Bhairava Tantra. Enlightenment means complete dissolution of the ego -not the refinement of it -- so when I see Tolle trying to pass this stuff as his own - it just takes away of his claim of being enlightened. Tolle regurgitates in verbally articulate manner spiritual gossip or as another reviewer put it a rather funny manner superficial ""Hippy-Dippy wisdom"". ""Ultimately there are many religions but spirituality is only one and the essence of it is documented in the Upanishads."
4,'Now' is the only place we ever are.,This Power of Now has removed the torture of many of the regrets of my past and fears of the future.
4,inspiring,"I did an interview with Eckhart in Holland, and met a sincere man, sweet and timid in personality. His message is wide spread now, and stimulates many seekers to read even more. I would recommend readers of his book also to take a look at Tony Parson's book, ""As It Is"".Jan Kersschot, author of ""Nobody Home"""
2,Hope less,I found it depressing. It is all up to us - ignore your past and the future is not important. That is a little hopeless
5,A quick and powerful tool to help you cut through delusion.,I love The Power Of Now...this is a smaller version which is very potent....it contains the essence of the first book.
2,Wastes a lot of time,"First, you're forced to watch a 40sec Shape commercial each time you put in this DVD - you can't forward/go to DVD menu. The time-wasting only continues. Many of these moves could be combined to increase your heart rate and make better use of your time. Some exercises are even done sitting/laying down! My heart rate is barely 50% of maximum and muscles are not challenged at all with the basic lunges, mountain climbers, dead lifts, etc. Includes about 7-10 exercises in each section, each exercise lasts about 1.5 minutes (with 5 seconds of instruction and non-movement at the beginning), and a 5 second delay between each exercise - keep moving if you really want a decent workout.I like Michelle and have purchased her other videos. Lisa Wheeler's jazzercise style annoys me so much it's hard to concentrate. I expect her to go into jazz hands at any moment. This video is about what I expect from a magazine who thinks celebrities are an example of fitness."
4,Nice Product,Not that hard to install. I tossed it on the floor of the car so that the heater warmed it up and when I got to my destination I was able to put it on the steering wheel. Works well on my 15 year old Jeep.
4,Better than I expected,"The movie was a good waste of time nothing more. It's kind of hard to root for one side in this movie. The best parts are the cameos by Chris Rock, Gibson, Vince Vaughn etc."
5,Delightfully Surprised A++,"I have to admit that I didn't find this movie appealing when I first heard about it but I ended up getting it in the mail in a dvd lot. I watched it one night and I was absolutely astounded at how awesome this movie is - I was going to just watch half and go to bed but I couldn't - I was hooked. Mel Gibson is the director and wow, you can tell! The plotline is incredible and the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat. If you weren't thinking about seeing this movie, think again. You will enjoy it!"
4,Great Little Book,Small book with beautiful graphics. It is full of information on the history of the Mexica (Aztec). I mostly enjoy the way the authors interweaves the history with some rarely seen art. The book is well focused and well put together. It treats a unique people and culture with care not seen in more authoritative books.
3,The Thinker's Thesaurus,It was ok. I bought it for a friend as a gift. The hard back covering was a bit warped.
1,Not really a thesaurus,I was very disappointed. This is more a list of literary and political references than a thesaurus. Not at all useful for someone looking for just the right word to express a meaning.
2,Snob Appeal Without Substance,"If you're looking for a resource for unique synonyms, don't waste your money on this book.You'll find large gaps from missing words and more dictionary descriptions than synonyms.This could be easily categorized as a ""dictionary"", rather than a thesaurus. My first search was for a synonym for ""affirmation"". No trace. The list of words on page 9 jumped from ""affinity"" to ""affluence"".Further, nearly every listedThe Thinker's Thesaurus: Sophisticated Alternatives to Common Words (Expanded Second Edition)word on pages 8 and 9 was followed by a definition rather than a synonym selection."
3,fun but not useful,"This thesaurus is very entertaining, but not really useful for writing. Only one or two very out-there and sometimes hilarious words are listed for each entry. If you like words in general, get it. Don't get it for first-year English composition or any serious thesaurus needs."
3,Needs more thinking,Bought it for my KIndle and wish I had gotten the paper format. It would be easier to flip through. Was disappointed in the number of vocabulary words defined. Was hoping for a larger selection.
3,Hope you have a lot of time!,"Wow, well hope you are not doing anything for the rest of your life! Really fun, but rated it only three stars because it was so hard. I ended up puting it away three times without finishing it, but maybe someday I will have the time to complete it. All I can say is if you are advanced puzzle lover, you will love it."
3,"Basic techniques, not very practical","The techniques covered in this book are written in the 90's with a basic outline of techniques used on a team of agents. Not very practical for one or two-man teams as I was expecting. Most of the techniques covered in this book, while requiring several operators, can in fact be performed by one or two people thanks mostly to advancements in technology.In summary, this book has general information that can be tailored to your unique surveillance situation, however it is outdated and not the best resource for experienced professionals."
4,Strong Stuff,"The reviewer ""L.W."" is way too harsh on Regie. Regie's songs speak more unvarnished truth than much of the slick, schlocky, cliche-ridden, so-called ""Christian"" music being churned out today. Regie demonstrates that Christians can be witty, original, authentic, beautifully expressive, and, yes, at times brutally honest and ascerbic. I've worn out Regie's CD. It's great stuff. If you haven't listened, give it a try. Chances are you'll be hooked immediately."
4,Replacement for Inspiron 9100,"Purchased this to replace my Brick that no longer would charge the Battery in my Dell Inspiron 9100.Noticed the power supply is a Brand X (no name),& is not made by Dell. But then again, Dell buys things in Bulk & just slaps there Logo on it.Tested it for 2 days, & its working fine.Seems to have the chip that communicates with my Battery & the Laptop does not scream that its not a recognized Power Adapter.Dont know how long this thing will last, but for not, its working.Note that the Mickey Mouse power cord is about a foot shorter than the original, but I was able to use my original MM Cord. So its not so bad.If it explodes/dies/hums/bursts into flames, I will note it here in the future."
5,excellent book for ardms exam,this book is written according to the ardms guidelines.each topic is covered very comprehensively.this is an excellent book for a person who is preparing for ardms exam
1,broken and too expensive to repair,"I got this watch for a Christmas present a couple of years ago. After only a few months it stopped working. I took it in to a watch repair shop and was told that the part the broke would cost nearly as much to fix as it would to just buy a new watch. There was a warranty with the watch, but I forgot to send it in when I got it. So now I have a nice looking, broken watch."
2,Lack of evidence,This book was written by many authors. Some chapters look as if written by novice. Some contents are shown repeatedly by different authors. I don't want to recommend this book to the specialist of tissue engineering.
3,Not for the timid,"If you love vh, and have been playing guitar long enough to pick some things up by ear, this tape WILL HELP YOU! It shows 50 popular riffs you'll all recognize, even the ones you couldn't quite figure out before. REMEMBER, there are no shortcuts, you will STILL need to practice!!! ""Play like vh while you sleep"" it's not. But an excellent tool in demonstrating and applying the vh style. video quality- could be better, sound quality- pretty good, curt mitchell- impressive, but without a doubt, an 80's burnout."
4,Takes a bit to learn,"The video is very instructional. It is not recommended for anyone who just started learning guitar. The riffs are on, but not easy to pick up. By the way, I lost the insert for ""In the style of Ozzy's Hitmen"" and if anyone knows where or how I can get a new one please email me."
3,If it weren't for Murphy's Law,"If it weren't for Murphy's Law, I'd have no luck at all. This video is OK, not great, but fun to watch. The lick I really wanted to see perfromed slowly was the last one on the tape, and as you may have guessed, it was the only one given short schrift. Still, if you have the bucks to spare, check it out."
3,Good Book,"I love the idea of this book but it really didn't give any ideas on how to do differently with your child, just that a Strong willed child needs to be disciplined and handled a little differently. Well, I will tell you that I pretty much already knew that!! Still a good read and had good information. Just wished it gave more ideas on how to handle them."
2,Good Information But Too Broad,"I am a parent of a 3-year old. The tapes were overall helpful in terms of parenting tips. The information shared for strong willed children was a little too broad for my use. It covered all ages, toddlers through high school. I would like tapes that are specific to age groups as approach would change. Buyers should be aware that the tapes have religious insertions all along the way."
1,Are you kidding me!!,Frontpage users need to understand that this latest version of FP has totally jumped into the realm of web serving. This book assumes that most FP users allready know or has some experience or knowledge of the admin part of web serving - give me a break! And what's the deal with devoting an entire chapter talking about colors! Wuz up with that! The section on PWS and FP2K Server Extensions are worthless. And that's the most important part of FP if you want to get into the advance component features. Need to rewrite this book in laymen terms.
5,I am SO STUPID,"I read this book as a ten-year old and it stuck with me for what has been the next seventeen years. Warm, wonderful, very charming. The ORIGINAL, BEST and should have been the ONLY version of the Parent Trap. I wish I had known that this book would be largely forgotten, I would have held on to my copy to share with my own kids."
2,"Alright, but not the quality you would expect","When I recieved the item, we were absolutely excited to get it put up. Our first problem was getting the poles to stand erect- they DID NOT want to stand up straight, they liked laying on the ground. Second, one of the ropes for the item was A FEW FEET shorter than the other rope! Trying to make a ring with it, you had about a 3x3 square to box in- not exactly ideal.We really never got to play in it the way you're supposed to. We ended up digging holes in the ground, erecting our own ring out of old wood and old rope, and just use the inflatable gloves for boxing matches with the kids (even the gloves are pretty poor quality, there's no real good way for them to stay on your hands). If I had known I'd have to do all this, I would have saved myself the $20+ on the crappy inflatable ring. The fact that the inflatables are durable is about the only good thing I have to say.I do not recommend this product, unless you like things that are a pain in the a**."
2,Better for Teens or Adults,"I had purchased this item for my small nephews. Not only was it cumbersome to set up, but we (adults) had difficulty making the ring posts remain upright. No matter what we did to them, they leaned. I don't know. Maybe we should've tried water, instead of air and sand.The children didn't seem too interested. They only wanted to pick up the posts and bop each other over the heads with them, or box the posts, or intentionally get tangled in the ropes and spin around in them. This might be a good item for a teen's room, or maybe at a party for adults. Save your money if you plan on purchasing it for anyone under 16. I've had it for at least five years, though, and it's very durable. I ended up giving it away, however, because the children simply lost interest in it after the first day."
4,Marty back on track,"This is the best outing by Ehrlich since the C/D/E cd. Great modern jazz compositions which feed from the tradition, be bop and mainstream elements. Great playing from everyone and especially Marty."
3,Things get weird...,"Space opera or soap opera, it is beginning to get hard to tell. Dr. Cherjio Torin, in order to save the Jorenians she loves from the Allied League turns to the brutal Hsktskt slave traders. And ends up a slave herself. Enslaved by her own husband. Confusing enough for you?Before I go on let me say that the sci-fi is soft, Star Wars, Star Trek, soft but that's OK as most of the story is character driven.Alone, hated and feared Cherjio must try to find out who she can trust, how she will survive, and how she can help those who don't want to have anything to do with her."
5,Speaking Spanish Like a Native,"Learning Spanish is a work in progress for me while I am living in Mexico. This book has been very helpful. I enjoy the smile from my friends when they note my progress in sounding more ""down to earth"" and less like a stilted foreigner. It has also helped my understand expressions that were once over my head.A good buy!"
5,daughter loves this set,My daughter received this set for Christmas and she really enjoys playing with it. Her favorite thing to do is to build the highest tower she can and then put the mouse on top of the castle tower and pretend to rescue her. I like to experiment and see what kind of different things she and I can build. I also like the fact it comes in a zippered pouch for storage and the pieces are colorful and easy to fit together. Overall a good purchase for the sale price.
4,2-for-1 Flashback!,This CD actually contains Kim Wilde's first 2 albums: her 1981 self-titled debut and 1982's Select.Track listing:Kids in AmericaChequered LoveWater on GlassEverything We KnowYoung Heroes2-6-5-8-0You'll Never be so WrongFalling OutTuning In Tuning OnEgoView from a BridgeWords Fell DownAction CityJust a FeelingChaos at the AirportTake Me TonightCan You Come OverWendy SaidOur TownCambodia (Reprise)I had these two releases on vinyl and am glad to have them finally on CD. The first release was more pop-oriented while Select is a little darker. A nice flashback to my high school days!
5,Dickies uniform pants,These pants look good and seem to be wearing well. i bought size 8 husky and they fit extremely good.
3,Great music - poor camera work,"I must first state that the music and musicianship is of a great quality - the final track really does it for me - my only complaint is that the camera work is poor - the filming is distant, so a lot of the live vibe is lost and we buy the dvd to catch th vibe - there are no close ups of the rest of the band plying their trade.All said this is still a worthwhile disc to add to your collection - its not everyday that Arturo agrees to private shows!!!!!!"
5,Classic Book On Honest Spirituality,"Everything that Larry Crabb writes is full of wisdom and depth. In this classic book Dr. Crabb goes beyond simple cliches and religious talk to explore what knowing Christ can really do to change our life. Typical American Christianity is often is a list of do's and don'ts to somehow guarantee moral uprightness and/or instant happiness---but if someone is willing to look honestly, often produces people that are no different than those without Christ. How can knowing Christ really make a difference in our life? As Dr. Crabb puts it, ""There is joy. There is hope. There is love. There is more in relationship with Christ than we've ever imagined...This book is not about relief; it is about change. Its message is not, ""Here's how to feel better now."" Rather, it deals with the route to transformation of character."" Do you want to be changed?"
1,piece of junk,"i purchased this product from a large electronics store, and not even a year later the laser is shot. Now all it does is sit in a box under my bed and collect dust. This product is decieving. The price is good, but not worth the risk of it breaking on you in less than a year"
1,Unreliable,This CD changer seems incapable of successfully playing 5 CD's at a random setting without mis-reading at least 2 of the CD's- I'm constantly having CD's skip because they are not placing in the tray correctly when being played. Once I had one completely stuck in there and had to pay a repair shop to get it out (and paid about the same price of the CD changer!)Spend a bit more and get a reliable CD player that actually plays correctly.
3,Just OK,"This strategy guide was just OK. It wasnt what i was looking for becasue it just gave general advice like 'try to recruit players that are interested in your school instead of those that arent'. It gave me a couple new ideas, but overall it was less than i expected."
1,They are good but something isn't wholesome,"As I read the description I come away with that there are 4-16oz packages in the box for $39.95. If I read it right then 1 16 oz package costs $10.00. I do not know about anyone else but I do not ever remember buying a package of Keebler cookies for $10.00 I have paid $3.00 and 2/$5.00 but never $10.00. Someone is making one heckuva profit on a discontinued product. How is a consumer going to be reassuredKeebler Mini Cookies, Fudge Stripes, 2Oz Snack Pack, 8 Packs/Boxthat the cookies are eadable?"
2,"Nice product, Poor fit","This was a great deal with fast shipping but the fit on each of the ends was very poor. one end cut straight the other one at an angle? It was about 3/4 an inch short also, which left a gap at each end. looked like a second to me. It is well constructed except for the odd cut ends which makes it look cheap. Tape does work well and I would return it if taking it off would not destroy it."
3,many a green isle,"the chief claim to importance of the town of Marsden is the presence in it of Marsden College, which has been educating the sons and daughters of solid, conservative citizens for almost a hundred years.As head of Marsden's Department of English, Gavin MaAllister leads a busy and constructive life. Twenty years earlier he made the choice between romance and ambition and has never regretted his decision. Even the coveted Ph.D. seemed to be within reach. With all well at home, he has been able to save almost enough to enable him to take a year off from teaching and work on his dessertation.Suddenly, this quiet idyll is shattered by two strokes-independent of each other, yet remotely connected."
2,Price is a ripoff,"I don't care how good the program is - at twenty bucks for 30 minustes it's a ripoff. As usual, products geared to children are overpriced, because manufacturers exploit the gullibility of parents who ""want nothing but the best""."
2,DVD -Vamos a jugar,"With this DVD, you're going to no where. The DVD teaches about 15 words total, from head to toes and that's it.No sentence only the part of the human body that's it, your kid will learn anything from this DVD. 17.00 + s/h about $1.00 per word.... very expensive."
1,Included slides are useless,"I agree with the other reviews. My son got this as a Christmas present, and was more interested in the big flashlight aspect of it than the slides. The slides are completely blurry, and there is no 3D effect. I am trying to find other non-3D slides that fit the projector, though, and would like to hear from anyone who might have found some (johncpratt@yahoo.com). If available, they would greatly improve the usefulness of the projector. Otherwise, skip it."
1,I agree with others!,"I love the caller ID/phone/alarm/clock combo idea...but I agree with the others, it's hard to read the LCD, it's annoyingly bright, it's too easy to reset the time, and my pet peeve: the phone HANDSET does not fit well/easily into the cradle...therefore it's too easy to bump off and it seems like always off the hook. Good idea that needs alot of redesign!"
2,I was very disappointed in this product,"The idea is a good one, but I found it flawed, especially in two ways. First, even during simple movements like hanging up the phone it is practically impossible to avoid hitting the the time-set buttons and accidently changing the time... not a good thing when you are counting on the clock to get up for work. Second, if you have the radio on and the phone rings, the radio is supposed to shut off when the receiver is lifted. This didn't work, and as I recall required some drastic measures to get the malfunctions reset (like unplugging the thing.) I hope that others can counter my experience with success, but I was not happy with the GE clock radio phone."
2,Almost a winner,Good idea but bad implementation of what a bedroom clock should be.The viewing angle of the LCD on the Bedroom Clock Radio Phone is very poor. Unless you look at the clock directly you can not tell what the time is. There is also an anoying green flashing light to indicate a new call is listed on the caller ID. If GE were to change out the LCD and remove the green light this would be a 5 star product.
2,No Radio on this Phone..,"Ummmm... I have this phone and it does have an alarm and caller ID, but NO AM/FM radio as stated in the description. You can choose either the buzzer or some annoying electronic ""music"" to wake to. There are some good features such as the dual alarm, but the negatives offset this. The display is VERY bright making it hard to sleep and sometimes when I hit the snooze button, it ""freezes"" the clock until the alarm is turned off, thus making the time 9 minutes slow. The phone cord is way too short as well. Not a bad phone for the price I guess, but I was very disappointed."
3,This cd is OK,"I'vebeen listening to the cd for about half a week There are better cd's but it is OK the best songs are Great Big White World, The Dope Show, Rock is Dead, User Friendly and The speed of pain"
2,New Manson disc is rather disappointing,"It seems Marilyn Manson may never return to his further glory. It's difficult to take a guy seriously when he constantly parades himself around on MTV. The rock star nonsense is quite lame. I didn't care too much for ACS, but it wasn't a bad album. Mechanical Animals one the other hand, completely lacks originality. Manson tries to write intelligent, poetic lyrics here but fails in the end. He should stick to social commentary. This is a throw back to the days of bad glam rock. Avoid Mechanical Animals, instead try Manson's first CD Portrait of an American Family if you haven't already...otherwise spend your money elsewhere."
5,Antichrist Superstar: Inside out and upside down!,"This album should be bought in conjunction with Antichrist Superstar to get the full effect. More accessable to the masses than AS, but still with full force songs like Rock Is Dead. This album serves to alienate the fans he made with AS, likewise that will alienate the newbies. My personal favorite song is Last Day on Earth if only to remind me of the good old days of Bowie and Bauhaus. A magnificent album from a floppy pop-freak."
3,Different... definately different...,"Four years after Marilyn Manson came onto the scene, he still manages to shock the world... but in a different way.Manson's third full length release ""Mechanical Animals"" casts away his trademark industrial/metal satanic darkness and replaces it with alternative/glam rock.While the album does contain some worthy tracks (i.e. The Dope Show, User Friendly, The Last Day on Earth, and Coma White), it fails to measure up to Manson's earlier works.The lyrics remain as black as night, but just don't have the same effect with a sugary candy coating."
4,"Old Floyd, Tori Amos, Radiohead and some grumbling dude...","I usually hate most popular music. This album reminds me of why I liked Radiohead's last album, except that its better. This album has highlights that are reminescent of old Floyd (not the post The Wall crap), Tori Amos, and Radiohead, except the oh so charismatic Marilyn, has such a gravely voice, its easy to remember who it is. I now refuse to shop at any CD outlet that refuses to carry an uncensored version of this CD."
2,Good Marketing,"I don't think this sucks at all, anyway is not great either is just fairly acceptable. I believe he's getting too much attention, more than he deserves. He is just a marketing product, and that's why i can't find many differences between him and the spice girls. If you are a goth fan this will suit your needs but to anyone out there i say: listen to really good bands like pearl jam, rem, smiths or radiohead."
2,Very Disapointing,"...I bought this expecting a hardcore, ..., vulgar, metal album, instead I got this. Post Human, Mechanical Animals, Dope Show, and User Friendly are OKAY. His other albums are great, but his one doesn't fill the void..."
1,a good alternative to sleeping pills,"oh man, the most boring album since since Spahn Ranches ""architecture"". Now dont get me wrong im a Manson fan...but this album just sucked. In his defense i think that he honestly thought he was going to bring back ""rock and roll"" and start a musical revolution...but Bowie-esque songs about androids and drugs just dont cut it. Skip this and buy Spooky Kids bootlegs instead."
3,A different sound,The new Manson Album (mechanical Animals) is a whole new animal. Manson forsakes his hard grinding style for harmony and melody. I think this album shows how much range Manson and the crew have. Frankly i was pleasantly surprised. I am sure people will complain about the change but all music evolves and changes and this time (in my opinion) the change has been for the better.
3,"Good album altogether, but...","Mechanical animals is a very good album. Songs such as ""Rock is Dead"" or ""New Model #15"" prove to be very promising to the new listener. However if you are a Manson fan already, you'll see that he still doesn't have that spark that he had in ""Portrait of an American Family"" or ""Smells like Children"". Whether he is a sellout or not is not my place to say, but he certainly doesn't have the same effect. One thing I will say bad about this album though... I miss Daisy Berkowitz. Zimmi wasn't even all that great, and this new guy doesn't show much talent either. Thank god for Pogo still being in the band. So if you're new to the Manson scene, I suggest getting this. If not, stick with Portrait."
4,AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE,"This CD has some really great songs on it. The Dope Show, I Don't Like The Drugs, Rock is Dead, just some of the great songs you'll find on this CD. You won't be dissapointed. One great buy!"
4,Youre missing it,"Alright..Where do I begin..? First off..The album is very good. It was a change..Okay..a BIG change from Anti-Christ Superstar. Manson went from Hardcore Goth-Rock to Glam nearly overnite. Anyway..I think most of you ""Manson fans"" or ""Non-Manson fans"" are missing the point of the album. The album was his transition from being emotionally numb..to emotionally open and comfortable with himself.(Thank you Rose McGawen) The album showed his progress from feeling like nothing to being happy that hes in love. He does things b/c he can not b/c no one else will do them. Thats it..Plain and simple. He does it b/c he can..And My Gods..He does it well."
1,This This the worst quality Video I purchased ever.,Picture is dark and sound is terrible. I would not justify to sell this concert even in VHS.
5,Lovely,This is my favorite thing to lounge around the house on a hot day or after a shower.Beautiful and comfortable.
2,"More ""interesting"" than ""engrossing"". Don't expect to be swept along","One of the core principles of good fiction writing is ""show, don't tell"". That holds even more true for film. This is an ambitious story which unfortunately unreels mostly through exposition. When the filmmakers do occasionally take advantage of the medium to show instead of describe they do it very well. Those scenes are few and far between, though - and usually brief. The actors (with one exception) handle the cumbersome dialogue impressively well. And whoever staged the operating room scenes (whether the director or second unit) needs to visit a hospital - or at least watch some medical dramas. These scenes lacked any credibility even to someone with my limited exposure. A movie more ""interesting"" than ""engrossing"". Don't expect to be swept along."
4,"Unexpected, original, and very entertaining","The movie is a twisted political and romantic drama. It was entertaining from beginning to end and not too predictable. You end up learning a little about the local culture along the way, but who knows how much of that is accurate. If you need a typical American happy ending, don't watch it. If you can appreciate something that is outside of the mainstream, it's a must see. Enjoy."
2,Lost In Translation,"I picked up this book hoping to find really a good academic telling of the fables. Instead, I find a poorly written book full of grammatical errors. Plus, I think there is definitely something lost in the translation of the original fables as most of the ""morals"" make no sense in relation to the story. The introduction to the book, which really could have used a good editor, is very wishy washy about saying anything definitive as to the origins of these fables. The notes attached after some of the fables shed very little if any light on the meaning of the fable or the symbolism used. I get the feeling that the the Temple's got bored with their subject matter and just threw something together to be done with it.There has to be a better translation of the source material out there."
5,book of the year,"i have to admit, i was a little embarrassed buying this book in the ""young adults"" section of my local bookstore, but they may as well have had ""the hobbit"" sitting right next to it, definitely not a ""just for kids"" read. i compare donita paul to two of my favorite authors- J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. her imagery is bright and engrossing, her characters developed and compelling, all in all, dragonquest is easily comparable to the hobbit or the chronicles of narnia, definitely a must-read for the hardcore tolkien fan, and i for one cannot wait for dragonspell(book three) to be realeased next year."
1,a real shame,"Too bad! The fact that a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of this book is around means I will no longer assign _I, Rigoberta Menchu_ to my students."
1,A waste of paper,"I had passed the 4 core NT 4.0 exams on the first try. I bought this book and the ""Guide to Proxy Server 2.0"" by Course Technology to study for my 5th MCSE test. These books are exact duplicates of each other (notice they have the same author). And both are not worth the paper they are printed on.They often repeat the same subject in different chapters in different ways, such that I had to flip back and forth between chapters to try and figure out what they were trying to say. But even so, the information seemed conflicting (I can't tell you for sure because after reading the book twice, I don't feel I understand Proxy Server 2.0).But since I did well on the questions, I figured I could pass the MCSE test. Wrong...I failed. The questions on the real test did not resemble those found in the book. I have used other Exam Cram books and found them worth while, but this one was a waste of my time."
4,Nice Toy,The toy is nice. The base pieces may not be as many as you would like to expand it more. my kid (3 yrs old) liked but I did most of the design :) It might be more expensive than I'd estimate it.
2,Too Difficult for Kids to Assemble,"I got this because my 4-year-old loves gears. My kids have the Playschool Busy Gears and love them. I thought this would be a more advanced version of that for her to play with. I don't like this toy though because it is really difficult to put together. My daughter likes to turn the gears with the handle, but an adult always has to build it for her. Other kids I have seen play with this toy have a lot of trouble too. It looks cool but isn't a practical choice for a kid. The base is really hard to put together because not all of the pieces will interlock with each other. The pegs that hold the gears onto the base are also very hard to put on."
4,Great toy but my son is a little young still!,Definitely go buy the manufacturers age recommendation. i bought this for my 1.5 year old and he doesn't quite get the concept yet. Also the pieces get lost easily since there are so many.
3,Kinda lame,Some of the tracks kick it but too many just provide background -and there's nothing over top so background is all you get with this album.
3,HMS Surprise,"I know this is heresy but I found ""HMS Surprise"" to be a little plodding. I know the dialog, settings, etc are historically accurate but I find myself feeling as I did in English literature class; This isn't that enjoyable but I know it's good for me. I felt the same with ""Master and Commander"" and ""Post Captain."" I have read many historical novels, ""Sharpe's Rifles"", the Hornblower series twice as well as the Drinkwater books (highly recommended), all of them very good to excellent. I will continue to read O'Brian's books but I think one every five years will do just fine."
2,Where's the story?,"There's no story behind this game. The back of the package displays a greatly written intro to a story, but as you begin to play, you realize that this is just a simple point and click shooting game. For those of you who enjoy pointing and clicking without reason, go ahead and buy it. But for the rest of you, esspecially those who enjoy a good story, stray away from this title."
5,Dire Straits - Communique,"Communique is the ""must have"" album for anyone who has merely heard the radio cuts by Dire Straits. During the years that this band ruled the airwaves they were pigeonholed into a few hits but their other stuff was bigger, more dynamically powerful, darker sometimes. Knopfler's guitar always was amazing and never better than on Communique."
1,Wrong language,We were trying to buy this superb book in Spanish for a friend from Spain. The description gave the language as Spanish but when the book arrived it was in English.
1,Unpleasant; too much heat and no flavor,You have to use so little of it there is almost no discernible flavor. Maybe useful for pranks or college students but not for people who love spicy foods.
2,"Boxy and unflattering fit, uncomfortable",This was on my wish list but unfortunately it fits very boxy around the entire body and is uncomfortably tight around the arms.
1,"Interesting premise, lame movie","This seemed like an interesting idea, but it was just really lame. I thought this was an actual media stunt, but was disappointed that it was not. So if we can't recover much of the $3 we spent (way too much), we'll review it poorly to further diminish its value."
2,Not great,"I honestly didn't see what was supposed to be funny or interesting about this movie. Don't be fooled by the big names attached to it, they are cameos only.The only line I found really funny was a critic saying about Pauly Shore's TV show: ""it sucks worse than gravity."" I am not saying that this could be applied to this movie as well. Not quite."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen.,"I usually shy away from discouraging others from watching a movie, because who knows what their taste is, right? But this was the biggest waste of my time I have ever experienced. It was so bad in every way, and not in a kitchy-b movie kind of way, just bad. They tried to make it looked home filmed, which just came off as cheap and bad. They had the same few actors commenting repeatedly, which was bad. Pauly's performance was so whiny and annoying that by the end of the movie I WANTED him to be dead. I would rather sit at the dentist's office getting my teeth drilled out with no painkillers than ever watch this movie again."
3,could have been better,"I really dont think pauly's that bad a guy, he can be funny at moments, and this film definitly had a few laugh out loud moments. one of the major criticisms i have for this movie is it's poor production value, but it was created on a shoestring budget, and i give him credit for doing it. the next thing is some of the actors in this movie were really horrible, i mean vomit inducing, fred durst for example. the concept of the movie is pretty cool, and pauly's pretty good in it, but a director he is not, a good director would not have let alot of the flubbed dialoge into the final cut. Although i think if a major studio decideds to remake this movie with pauly it would be a major hit."
5,Christmas with Pavarotti,"I Listened to this the day I received it...wonderful sound, I especially like his ""O Holy Night"" and ""Adeste Fideles""...and of course ""Panis Angelicus""...some persons have mentioned him & Mario Lanza...Mario was good but Luciano is/was the greatest !"
3,Boxwave case (white),"The white case is the perfect size, however the white rubber along the outer edge yellows rather quickly with limited sun exposure."
5,broad scope of music,I was very impressed with the CD. It seemed to have alot of different musical tastes. I enjoyed it very much. Rock on dudes.
5,A Must For Dylan Fans.,"Some of his best songs here. Check out "" Changing Of The Guards"" and Senor:Tales Of Yankee Power. Great arrangements to accompany the strong lyric content. Love the use of the extra vocal backing. probably not given enough critical acclaim as it deserved back in the day. Bravo, Bob."
4,Street Legal Revisited,"It's like having a brand new Dylan disc, with a wonderful opportunity to enjoy Dylan's now-lost gift for magnificent phrasing. His vocals then were a thing of wonder. The big treat is the newly-discovered presence of the band on the remaster. All of a sudden, they're truly there. In Baby Stop Cryin', they used to disappear entirely for a couple of seconds at the begining. Now you can hear them slide it down as Dylan's vocal coasts in. On New Pony, they are rocking harder than we ever knew. A joy."
2,Eh...,"This is probably the only album in Dylan's catalogue I can't stand (aside from, of course, SAVED - but that's a given for most). I don't know what it is...the use of female backup singers, the tepid big band instrumentaion, or Dylan's tired-sounding vocals. There are some decent songs here, but they're marred by poor delivery."
3,Terribly frustrating,"Bob Dylan wrote some very good songs for ""Street Legal"".And then he hired a horn section and several backing vocalists, and let Don DeVito add some of the slickest production ever to marr a Dylan album.Many of these songs (""Changing Of The Guards"", ""True Love Tends To Forget"", the semi-classic ""Señor"", the underrated ""Is Your Love In Vain?"") are as good as anything Dylan has written since ""Blood On The Tracks"" (well, almost), but the glossy production and the truly horrible, Vegas-style backup singers completely drown most of the songs, and discourage anyone who tries to pay too close attention to what is actually a fine batch of tunes.I rarely listen to this album...it's such a frustrating experience."
1,not good for the price,It has very cheap look. Seems like those kinds of 99c stuff.The bond is not very comfortable. I am surprised that it can't directly detect heartbeat from wrist. I wouldn't buy it if saw it at real stores.
2,Buy a Mask with quick release lens system,"Terrible design to incorporate this lens into a mask. It is the most user-unfriendly system I've ever seen. It takes an hour to replace the lens. That's with tools. I don't know how long it would take if you tried to do it the recommended way. Also, lenses are limited to a 1 year lifespan and must be replaced every time you are shot within 10 feet. Buy a mask that does not require such effort."
5,Worth it for high end systems.,"Not all toslink optical cables are equal. I can hear the difference, especially on the sound from my Gigabyte GTX 470 super overclock edition video card to my Onkyo TX-NR808 then via optical pass through on my 32"" LG LH40 to my Logitech Z906. Sometimes I like having 5.1 and 7.1 simultaneously, especially on Rock mdvds. You can never have it too loud or too clear for 2112 on disc three of the Snakes and Arrows Live mdvd.My LG doubles as a computer secondary screen as well as a tv so I turn in around often and my old toslink wiggled too much. This monster toslink stays in the socket much better.I am glad I bought two of these cables as my Z906 is usually playing computers sound instead of movies and mdvds. The Z906 had problems detecting signals when I switched sound sources until I put the two Monster cables on and it does sound better on both sound sources."
5,To Snore or Not To Snore,"Rob Simon provided an entertaining look at a problem that many people throughout the world face every night - snoring. He detailed his journey for a cure - and he literally tried about everything. He partnered his experience with the scientific data of why we snored and well as what worked for others and the effectiveness of each method throughout the snoring world. It was also a fairly quick read.On the downside, a lot of the information is readily available for free on the Internet. He did do an excellent job of compiling lots of knowledge in one source that had me laughing on several occasions. Personally, I would rather read a 150 pages book than comb through 25 websites to find the information that I really want.In summary, don't think reading this book is going to automatically sure your snoring. You have to actually follow through and attempt many different strategies to see what works for you."
3,NOT WHAT I WANTED .,"the picture makes it look like its an eyelash strip , when really .. they're just those stupid individual ones . very deceiving picture . >.< i am not happy with my product."
2,"Asimov -- quantity over quality, always.","This collection of short stories constitutes a perfect illustration of the problem with Asimov: the man wrote millions of words in his life, but many of them weren't worth the effort. I've always enjoyed the Black Widower mystery stories, but in this fifth collection of those stories we learn that Asimov has pretty much run out of good ideas. So he publishes bad ones instead. I've read ""Encyclopedia Brown"" stories that were based on more clever plot twists than some of the stories in this book."
2,Bad product - good idea,"These ties do not stick very well to any surface. In order to use them, you will have to add additional GOOD glue."
2,"Good design, needs better adhesive.","I really like the low profile of these mounts, but I have found they do not hold well to finished particle or glue board, which is what a lot of desks and tables are made of on the underside. About half of them that I placed had come unstuck after just a couple of days. I have not tried it, but maybe they stick better to painted metal or plastics."
5,Yanni on CD,"Hi- like I said, I gave all my albums to Goodwill when I ""updated"" to CD, one of my only regrets in life. It's been a long wait to get this on CD, and I'm smiling as my force field is complete now."
4,Surprisingly enjoyable,"I was forced to read this book for my epidemiology course, and I found it surprisingly enjoyable. The stories are not too long, and I found that I thought I knew the problem before I got to the end, only to discover it was something else. A fun read, especially for college."
4,"All the essentials, no frills","Searched forever to find the perfect minimalist camping knife, and finally found it in the bantam. The blade will cuts anything you're likely to have on a camping trip. I think it's a good compromise between the mini blades and the larger ones, but it'll cut salami and cheese for years to come :). I was skeptical of the 'combo tool' at first as I couldn't find a review, but have been pleasantly surprised. It's shaped much like the regular bottle opener, and it doesn't have a blade on it, but it turns out that doesn't matter. It opens cans of tuna just as well as the regular can opener tool on all the other swiss army knives. All in all, it's small, light weight, and functional, and that's perfect for me. A 4 just because there is always room for improvement, not because I've found anything wrong yet."
4,decent pocket knife,"This is a well made pocket knife. Nothing fancy, but the blade is sharp and is snug when opened. I really only needed one blade and a bottle opener, so this knife is fine. Very light in my pocket, with no rough edges to tear the pocket. I now keep this in my car's glove box. Good deal for the money."
4,Good of a Well Balanced Work Out,"The yoga series in this dvd is similar to the type of yoga series that I have most often experienced at a gym class as opposed to a class at yoga studio. I consider myself a pretty average person, in terms of physical ability and to me this dvd provides a well-balanced workout that isn't too strenuous. If you are looking for something that incorporates the intellectual and spiritual aspects of yoga, this dvd is NOT for you. Luckily, I enjoy both approaches, so I still feel like I got my money's worth. I do think that if you are only going to buy one yoga dvd or if this is your first exposure to yoga, it would be better to get something with a more well rounded approach. Otherwise, if you are looking for a yoga series with a little physical challenge this might be just the thing for you. However, keep in mind that if you are very experienced with yoga or in REALLY good shape, this series would likely not be challenging enough."
1,"if you dont have the clothes,why you sell them?","if I have choice not to rate I wont give even a star! I ordered the coat and others, fews days later, I recevied all of the items I orderd EXCEPT this coat.Then amazon sent me a e-mail written in ""Due to a lack of availability, we will not be able to obtain the following item(s) from your order:""Marmot Men's Guides Down Hoody, Green Pepper/Midnight Green, Large""We've canceled the item(s) and apologize for the inconvenience. ""if you dont have the coats,why you sell them? it's winter time, I wait for this give it to my father, then after few days waiting, I heve to reorder other for my father,so ridiculous."
2,"Returned, but very warm","This jacket was insanely warm and I enjoyed it but the feathers were constantly sticking out of the seams. Too bad because it was incredibly warm, like, sweating while hiking in the winter warm."
1,BROKE IN THE FREEZER AFTER ONE WEEK !!!,"I bought an NFL Crystal Freezer Mug. After using it daily for one week, I opened the freezer to take it out and found a BIG JAGGED CRACK around the top and down the middle of the logo on one side. It appears that the substance inside had expanded too much and caused it to ""explode""."
5,Worth a Read,This book is a well written story of a young kid coming of age and the fright that can sometimes come with it.Excellent narration. Great use of tension. No surprise that this author is actually a professor in the creative writing department at Columbia College.I hope no one takes the couple negative reviews written by his former students with an ax to grind seriously.
5,Great Live Album,"Being an Australian, we didn't get to hear much of Tom Cochrane except for his ""Life Is A Highway"" and the related ""Mad, Mad World"" album.Most unfortunate really as that is really not a patch on this live album with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra from 1989. It is an excellent presentation of Tom Cochrane and Red Rider's great stuff from the '80's. Fortunately, I have had the opportunity to travel to Canada on many occasions to see family and was able to pick this up to my delight.The introduction ""Light In The Tunnel"" segues to ""Human Race"" and it is just great. The whole album sounds fantastic and is a great overview of yet another excellent Canadian outfit that has been largely overlooked around some parts of the world.This may not be known by listeners but it is just a fantastic album. I hadn't really listened to Tom Cochrane or Red Rider until I heard one of my Canadian cousins play this and I liked it immediately. You will too, if you give it a run."
5,Great video,"Enjoyed it and found it comprehensive. Relates astronomically as well as astrologically. Includes the vedic scholar Sri Yukteswar's analysisTomAustin, TX"
3,The Legend of the Curse of the Bambino,"The Legend of the Curse of the Bambino is a joy to read. It talks about Babe Ruth in his baseball career. This is a very intense story.This story captures the magic of baseball. It shows the smiles and the tears that are a part of this game. The invisible bond among the generations is inspiring. The new players remembering the old players, really shows the dedication and love they have for this sport. The Legend of the Curse of the Bambino shares the joy of rooting for a team. When the fans get excited when their team wins is so exhilarating.This book is a blessing for all ages. The pictures are very interesting and detailed. The clippings from the newspaper are a great touch to the story."
1,Attention good parents: Don't let Shank disappoint your kids!,"One would think Shaughnessy, a.k.a The Shank, would be perfect writing for children. His Boston Globe columns amount to no more than childish drivel. Yet one should expect a writer who is so disappointing to adults to do likewise for kids. He attempts here to get his claws into children and brainwash them into believing his so-called ""curse"" gibberish, and therefore perpetuate his own revenue stream. The Shank's hope, so transparently self-serving, is that these kids will grow up buying more of his foolish fiction. The real ""curse"" was the alcoholic haze under which the Red Sox were run and managed by the Yawkeys, Harrington, et al(thank you Clark Booth and Leigh Montville, two real journalists, for pointing this out). Parents: Be warned! Keep your kids away from The Shank."
4,"Entertaining, but nothing special.","The Grey was a good one time watch, and entertained my girlfriend and I for the evening. But it's not something I'd want to own for further viewing. The story itself is simple, and is essentially one big chase. It did look very beautiful though, being shot in British Columbia or the surrounding area."
2,The Gray. A survival movie.,"I think that Liam Neeson should have turned this picture down. His acting talents are much better than what this movie had to offer. He lost his girl (or wife). No reason to kill himself just before he is going home. You don't find out that she died until the movie is just about over. He's the star so he leads the group. Shotgun shells=stupid. Torches that don't go out=poor writing. Jumping across a very wide cavern with a short start and heavy boots on plus a lot of clothes, without getting hurt=far fetched. Sticks against wolves. Bad odds. I mean, come on man. Get real."
1,"Classic tragedy, badly done",Virtually every character that matters dies. That's a hard story to pull off. The number of well known tragedies is rightly short. This movie won't be joining that list.The basic premise of a pack of wolves hunting down a group of humans is unconvincing. The majority of the human characters seem like caricatures. The choices they make trying to get themselves rescued are laughably stupid. And the bit with the wallets literally made me slap my forehead. Just plain stupid.
3,The Grey,"Liam Neeson is always watchable and the cinematography is terrific. Not much of a storyline, however and the ending is predictable."
1,Stay away from The Grey,"Give an award to the trailer editors for splicing together something from their imagination that held no reality to the film's true nature or theme. From the beginning moments to the closing scene, the entire movie is about death. And while there's nothing wrong with movies that deal with this important topic, this film was devoid of all deeper meaning or greater perspective. It fell from gray to a depressing shade of black. Then, as if it hadn't already overdosed on it's loathing of life, it felt the need to inject lethal doses of human depravity, over-the-top violence, unrealistic fight-against-nature sequences, and a script that could have been written by troubled middle schoolers (trying to outdo each other with how many f-bombs they can squeeze into each phrase).Philosophical depth? No. Just a look at fatalism from a cold, shallow perspective.What wasted opportunities -- for this film, a great actor, and my evening."
2,Save Your Money!!,"First, please save your money on this one, wait till it's in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart. If you've seen the commercial you've seen the movie, the other hour and 58 minutes is filler. The ending is horrible. Not horrible in the Horror sense but in the terrible, no-good sense. The whole wolf thing, fake and unbelievable. Sorry Liam I was really hping for a great movie from you."
1,Terrible movie!,"Possibly one of the worst movies I've seen in the last 5 years. Obviously, the director did not do any research about wolf packs or wolf behavior. Also, the sound effects that they used were completely unrealistic - the most ridiculous being the ""growling"" sound emitted from the wolves - this was actually a sound that elephants use to communicate with each other, not wolves. The special effects with the green eyes in the wolves and the wolves themselves were awful displaying how a low-budget film should not try for special effects like these. I can't believe that Liam Neeson wasted his time filming this story with sub-par writing and poor directing."
5,Much better than many give credit for.,"Okay, i'll admit, this is not a 5 star film, I would give it around a 3.8 but since it's had such an unfair bad wrap by many i'll attempt to boost it a little.First thing, Watch the ENTIRE movie people. Before you judge the ""ending"". ...The film, okay it's not quite Oscar stuff sure, and yes for the 1000th time ""Wolves don't act like that"" It's a Mooooovie people... BUT I found it to still be a pretty engaging film, there is a bigger story than some would have you believe. And yes, there are a few Hairy moments (no pun intended) and enough action to keep most watching. BTWay nor does this film disrespect Wolves or animals as some may profess. I think many have missed the point of the deeper meaning here. If you haven't seen it yet, please give it a try."
4,2 WORDS,"Worth the money whether you buy or rent. You WILL watch it again eventually, It's just one of those movies. I am ranking this film up there with The Way Back and Alive, it shares both of those movies feelings and strikes the same emotions. This is more of a mans movie rather than a thrill seeking, action pumping explosive hype for impatient kids or girlymen kind of movie. This film strikes the primal emotions of man. MUST WATCH!"
3,If Your're Absolutely Bored... MAYBE Watch The Grey,"The Grey started out very promising. The film attempted to portray the wolves as beasts who rule their domain, and the humans are just unluckly souls who happened to survive a horrible plane crash. Sound good, right? Before the wolves even ate one person, I had already picked out who be eaten and in what order. A good film, would NOT be predictable. However, if you like watching people be tortured and then killed... this is the flick for you! If you enjoy hopelessness; well, it's a got a good does of that too."
2,Disappointed.....,My sister gave this movie such high praises that I went ahead and rented it in amazon instant video. What a let down this movie was. I was expecting more action but all I got was half that. If I could get a refund I would surely ask for one
3,oke story,An exciting story which grabs you from beginning to the end. Although the end was not satisfying and not really believable still good acting and a good story
3,The Grey,Not a fun movie. Enjoyed watching however. Lack of closed caption is definately a major negative. Other entities provide closed caption. I don't know why Amazon.com is so behind the times they need to move into the 21st century. I probably won't stream any more movies from Amazon.com until they can provide closed caption. I would like to know if a movie has closed caption before I pay for a streaming movie.
2,"Interminable, cliched, uninvolving. . .","This movie comes across as having been conceived by amateurs. You don't care a hoot for any of the characters. Indeed, there are no characterizations at all. The wolves have more depth of character than the actors, which isn't saying much because they look like phony studio props. The movie plods through ice and snow, or finds its characters sitting around the ole campfire shooting the cliched breeze, punctuated by occasional wolf attacks, and flashbacks that add nothing of depth to the story. There's no dramatic arc whatsoever. The movie simply doesn't engage you on any level. It was apparently based on a short story written by a friend of the director. But it comes across as something you might get the guys in high school together to do -- hey, let's shoot a film, and we'll just sit around and improvise cliched dialogue and see what we come up with."
1,The Grey,This movie was absolutely horrible. You hope it will get better and it doesnt. Not worth the time viewing it.
2,A Let Down,"Great acting,and must admit the movie kept you watching.The ending however ruined the whole movie.The plot of this movie comes out in the end,and it left the viewer shocked in saying to themselves..""This is the plot""?One time watch,and not worthy of my movie collection.The movie started off great,just the ending was a huge let down.To bad someone in Hollywood allowed such a stupid ending,that ruined a perfectly good movie at the start.Lots of movies are made with alternative endings,they were asleep at the wheel on this one.Dam."
1,A Disney ride is more frightening,"Liam Neeson does take on the occasional turkey of a role and this one is certainly a prize winner in that category.The film is completely unrealistic and beyond boring.The special effects are like from the dollar store. In one scene, the eyes of the wolf pack lighting up is laughable as they look exactly like a bunch of lights. They are all exactly spaced apart perfectly with the same amount of light ""reflected"" in their eyes. Just eyes, no wolves.So many stupid moments, like let's all sleep inside the plane wreckage but leave one guy outside in the arctic weather as a ""lookout"". A lookout for what?Then of course there is the classic ""Let's move to the trees because the wolves don't want us here"" line, which should haunt Mr. Neeson for the rest of his career.I could spend two hours lampooning this film scene by scene but why bother?Avoid watching this loser unless you see if for free and have absolutely nothing else to do, as it is a total waste of time."
3,Hollywood's idea of nature ?,"The other reviewers do a good job pointing out the problem with this movie .It seemed to fight with itself to decide what kind of movie it wanted to be .a) Serious survival story-or-b) Unrealistic supernatural CG! wolf-monster movie--or--c) Symbolic movie about soul searching and self redemptionPerhaps by trying to be three movies at once, it never quite succeeded at reaching its full potential on any of the levels.It was beautifully shot.Great acting by all involved.Well written dialog.Did a fair job of pulling you into their situation .........BUT ............SOMETHING just didn't work and the film never really touches or grabs you.It's like a well done technical movie ... but missing a soul or spirit that gets to you.It's hard to place a finger on what exactly was missing in the movie, but it just kind of lumbered along ---- ended ...... and then was pretty forgetable.My wife just looked at me and went ...... ""Hmmmmmm, that's it ?"""
5,A film with far more depth than expected,"This movie strikes me as being poignant when least expected. The overlying story is predictably terrifying in many respects; yet the survival and perhaps redemption of the cast of characters is always slightly out of reach. Nonetheless, they find solace, or so we hope, in their end-of life recollections of the ones whom they love. The movie's finest scenes are found in its expression of how people can reach out to respect and honor others in their last moments."
1,DON'T do it!,"I want to give it low rating but refuse to waste any more time (ie: thinking, organizing and typing an extensive review) on this movie. The best part of this movie was reading some of the reviews on imdb. There are people that actually write: ""I don't know why everyone is upset, the wolves are just being wolves..."". Jesus, the wolves are just being wolves. In my entire outdoors life (over 40 years) I've seen wolves maybe 3-4 times & they ran off at any sudden movement or sound. Hollywood has to think the american population has gotten so stupid that they can feed us any amount of contrived BS & we'll accept it..."
3,My rating.,"I didn't enjoy this as much, I love most of, or should I say, the ones I have seen with the actor Liam Neeson as lead. He is one of my favorite actors, but I think this movies wasn't one that show cased his talents. He is way to talented to be in a movie such as this. The most important thing I like about this actor, is that most of the movies I've seen him play in, is he doesn't use profanity, and there isn't a lot of unnecessary sex scenes. I am a Christian and I do not watch any movies rated (R). As long as he continue making movies the way he has, I will always watch his movies. I would and have recommended any movies I know he is playing in."
1,"Spare yourself the 2 hours, and do something else","This movie is pretty much a conglomeration of brutality, blood, and complete lack of a story. I won't get into more details for those of you plan to watch it, but don't get your hopes up. Besides Liam Neeson's awesome voice (think back to Taken), there's nothing worth seeing/hearing here."
2,Originaly bland,Wasnt that great to be honest. Feel asleep trying to watch it. Ending felt a bit forced too. Don't recommend.
1,"Love Liam, but hate movie.","Movie is fit for juvenile audience. Mature movie go'ers beware. Ending was really really bad in every way. Juvenile. Good filming, bad plot and script. Lots of 'dark' scenes, (just noise, growls, and movement)."
1,Stunk,This movie just plain stunk . Everything they did just was wrong and never would have happened. Very very disappointing. Unbelievable and then the ending was the kicker which made it 10 x worse everyone in the theater even went you have got to be kidding me. The biggest waste of time and money.
3,"Decent Movie, not a double watcher",Over all the movie showed the spirit of the human race for survival. Even when the out come is a for gone conclusion. The ending was a fitting ending and the movie was a fast paced movie. However in my opinion it did not live up to the expectations that the advertisement set. I would however tell someone that it was worth watching.
1,Waste of time,"What a horrible movie. The only thing it was good for was to up your profanity quotient for the year. No story, no plot and what little there was was absolutely ridiculous."
3,A bit on the strange side,Hubby and I liked it except for the very end when Liam Neeson used God's name in vane!That was a BIG mistake and a BIG disappointment....the movie would've been great without that!
3,Just Ok,"The story line is OK, best part about the movie is the wilderness setting, some of the wolve attack scenes are a little unrealistic, to much swearing/cursing for my wife and I."
3,More grey than just a wolf.,"Grey is a good description of this movie since the wolves are grey, the dark, snowy setting is grey, the mental outlook of the ""hero"" is grey, and the plot gets ever greyer as it progresses to its inevitable end. The language is appropriate for the kind of men depicted but still that much profanity is off-putting."
1,"""Lame"" Neeson ate 2 wolves...","""Lame"" Neeson and the cast ate 2 wolves to get in the mood for the movie. They also used two others for props. Boycott this movie if you think the eating of two wolves as some form of method acting is just wrong! I will never watch a movie with ""Lame"" Neeson in it ever again!"
1,Spears anyone?,"Why didn't they make spears by sharpening sticks? Seven large, strong men with spears could have wiped out the whole pack.That's just one example of a bad story that's just too unbelievable. A survival story without any real weapons, serious food gathering, shelter building or signal making is ridiculous. The drawn out emotional drama only emphasizes how the movie fails to depict a realistic story of survival where all remaining energies must be focused on survival."
1,The film is a joke,"Why bother with suffering through a bad plot, thin acting, and hype? The crash scene is okay and its Alaska - the scenery is outstanding. Nothing can save this film from B movie rating though. It's more of a lesson on what not to do if you want to survive a plane crash in the wilderness."
3,It's ok,"Not terrible, not amazing, it's just a decent middle of the road time waster. The story isn't novel, the acting isn't engrossing, the special effects aren't that good, and some of the wolf behavior is just unbelievable. Liam Neelson is the only saving grace of this movie, he's just good at this role."
1,Not so great,"The general plot of ""The Grey"" is not only predictable, but worn out completely. The Alaskan wilderness is not presented nearly as well as it was done in the several recent great documentaries about it. And there is a sort of ""antireligious manifesto"" included: at the beginning you see shot of a lit neon cross in the night, leading you to associate it with a chapel, immediately followed by a nasty bar brawl, and then at the end of the movie, a long, blasphemous, and vulgar tirade against God.I used to like Liam, but I lose respect for actors who participate in offensive blasphemies. What's their point? To follow the newest pro-pagan fad in Hollywood, or to impress individuals like Bill Maher? Or, just to make an extra buck?"
1,DVDS should have Weird Ending Warnings on them...,"DVDS should have Weird Ending Warning stickers on them. This film was Awesome at first, then just faded to Grey with a weird ending..."
2,A Stinker!,"This movie stinks! It's amazing they could make this bad an action/adventure film with so promising a premise.For starters, the film is at least 30 minutes too long. The extra time is padded with pointless conversations and inane philosophizing about life's meaning.There is absolutely no chemistry between Neeson and the other actors (all of whom, besides Neeson, are completely miscast).The cinematogaphy is bland, the scene sequencing incoherent, the editing amateurish, the story unimaginative.There aren't even enough wolf scenes to make the film worthwhile. Even the ludicrous inter-species fights in ""Cowboys and Aliens"" were more interesting.Save your time and money: watch Cliffhanger or Vertical Limit instead."
1,Waste of time,This is probably the worst movie I have seen in the last five years.I foolishly saw it in the theater and could not believe how stupid the characters and story are. By the end of the movie I was on the side of the wolves.Save your money and your mind and stay away from this turkey.
2,Not a favorite,Just not my kind of movie. Seems like he is angry with the Master of the universe and needed a way to say how he feels about Him.
3,Mediocre,"This movie just feel flat for me. I gave it a three because Liam is one of my favorite actors and he delivered. The plot had everything going for it, but the directors/writers/editors failed to deliver that BANG effect! The plane crash and wolf attack scenes could have been sooooooooo much better. Unfortunately, blood and gore sells and excites in movies and this one missed it."
4,Keeps you on the edge of your seat...,This movie is not boring at all. It's exciting and thrilling from very early on and continues to hold interest. However I was disappointed in the wolves! They could have done a much better job making the wolves look realistic! Bottom line: It's a great thriller movie and Liam Neeson does a superb job as always! :)
1,I don't understand the love for this movie,"Totally unrealistic, anyone with half a brain knows that wolves don't act in that manner. A lone wolf does not run full bore at a group of people. Wolves are opportunists and pack hunters. I would rather see a monster movie with a mythical creature than a movie about real animals acting totally out of charecter. AND THE ENDING! Really?"
2,The Gray,"I love Liam Neeson but this movie was so violent all the way through and the ending was terrible. I think some people would give it 5 stars for acting and so would I, but the story was horrible and I guess I am just not into this kind of movie. I loved his movie Taken, but The Gray is something I wouldn't advise just anyone to watch."
2,not as helpful as i thought it would be,"i am glad i purchased it, and it came in a timely manner, however, it small print, and not as much room to put pertinent information."
2,This Item is nothing like Picture,This Item is nothing like Picture poorly made I could have made a better one myself out of old pillow cases.Not worth the money avoid this item.
4,Anakin Skywalker Costume,"When the costume is viewed online, it looks like a two-peice ensemble andthe boots apart. It actually is a one peice costume, which I think ispretty cool but deceiving. The front part is made of plastic and it wasso wrinkled I had to iron it on the reverse side. Overall, for the priceI paid and a little effort in making it look better, I'm satisfied andmy son is thrilled it came early for holloween."
1,SORRY,"Well, sorry to be the only one in disagreement, but this is a trivial and sophomoric book with absolutely nothing original in it. First off, I did live during Mickey's time, and I knew him casually. There are a lot of books describing Mickey's faults, all of which he admitted to himself. The pop psychology, done from a distance, with just the right amount of politically correct sociology really gets old in sports books. The Author contradicts himself several times and does not understand at all the mentality of managers or players in the late 40's and 50's. He gets off on the strangest tangents, and I can't for the life of me figure out what he was driving at. It's a pointless book that reminds me of an article in a checkout stand tabloid. Skip this, get Golenbock's ""Dynasty"" or ""Wild, High and Tight""."
2,French but not AZERTY,Maybe it is a Canadian-French keyboard. The keys are in QWERTY-layout style which is common in the USA and Canada while the French (France) use an AZERTY-layout keyboard. It was quite a disappointment for my French studies.
3,i feel a little empty,"Richter has some terrific ideas, but I felt as though I had missed something after about half of her stories. While ""Rats Eat Cats"" should not be missed, I wouldn't buy this book if you like short stories for the concise way that they are able to paint a small part of the world."
2,"Meant for kids, I guess","I'm a little disappointed with this necks trap, because it's too short. Not by much.. maybe half an inch too short. I can't adjust it to get my Yamaha YCL-250 into a correct, comfortable position. I'm six foot tall, average. Perhaps this neck strap is designed for younger/smaller clarinet players."
4,memories,This was so intresting as this is my history my roots my grandparents journey from italy to america i enjoyed seeing the old pictures and many could be my family..well done movie about the italians coming to ths country and especially enjoyed seeing the interviews ...highly recommend the film...amp
5,A Masterpeice,One of the 10 greatest rock albums of all time. Right up there with Abbey Road and the White Album. Own it. Listen to it. Relish it.
5,It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe,"A lot has already been written about this album, and I don't have much to add to it. I will just agree with those who say that this is one of Dylan's best albums. A masterpiece, and highly recommended."
5,Like an old friend.,"Even a cursed eighties born child of the disposible Killers-generation like me can appreciate the genius behind 'Blood on the tracks' In contrast to the commonplace acts of today, Dylans music has always sustained staying power and relevance and this record is still a great illustration of his amazing talent many years after its release. This is an important and poetic record which deals with real emotions (turning a failed marriage into a force for good) and contains some of his most eternal songs (such as 'Idiot wind' and 'Shelter from the storm') The virtuosity displayed on 'Blood' is rare and special. I would recommend this album to anyone."
2,These Mickey Mouse lyrics just don't do it for me,"Call me crazy, but when is an artist in our lifetime going to write something of substance? Not since Creed's last masterpiece in 1997 or so have we heard any music that matters. This one from Bob Dylan doesn't reverse the trend of sappy pop and meaningless lyrics that infiltrate the radio waves. Some of Dylan's acoustic work is good, and I give him props for his work at the controls, but where is the heart, where is the soul? Where is the topnotch singing? This guy sounds crusty and somewhat feeble.Now, if you're looking for good rock, check out Bush 'n' Creed. Those are bands that make Dylan look like a washed-up geek. Speaking of geeks, does anyone know when Coldplay's fourth album will hit stores?KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK...AND KEEP CHECKIN' MY SITE!!LATER!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"HEY PICASSO, NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR STOCK PROBS","great cd, but who cares about picassos stock problems w/amazon? this is a music/book site, not a wall street complaint post"
5,Como agua para chocolate,"A look at the inner workings of a Mexican family through recipes, magic and sex. A charming read. Highly recommended."
5,A NEW POINT OF VIEW OF FEMALES IN LATINAMERICAN CULTURE,"Laura Esquivel did her good launching her first successful master piece, Como Agua Para Chocolate. This novel let us see by Tita (main character) her repressive hard-to-die mother, a sister who brokes all cultural laws and another who becomes her adversary for the love of Pedro (main character). With the warm atmosphere of a kitchen, hard-to-achieve love, passion, more recipes and characters external and internal fights this novel is a must to have. Language is very simple but don't low the quality of the context. For spanish learners is ideal not just for spanish literature but get familiar with our culture."
5,Great novel and movie! Wonderful story of passionate love!,"I read this novel (and watched the movie) for a college research paper, and I thouroughly enjoyed both. It is a fascinating and somewhat erotic story about love, passion, rebellion, sacrifice, and great food! I recommend it, it's a must read! You also must see the movie to make everything come to life!"
2,Great Story but this edition has lots of typos!,"This book is a classic in Literature in Spanish, but please don't buy this edition from Anchor Books. It has a lot of typos and spelling mistakes that a good editor would never allow.It was a very disappointing buy... but a great story regardless. That is why it gets 2 stars and not one."
2,No es muy bueno,"Este libro entretiene pero la historia es muy exagerada y hasta en ocasiones absurda. Lo mas que me decepciono fue el final. Fue original, pero absurdo. Lo bueno de este libro son las recetas tradicionales mexicanas."
1,worst book I ever read,"The use of the language is poor, the characters are caricatures. It is the most over hyped book I have ever read. The plot is lame and I only finished it to comment how bad it was."
5,Teknoman complete,"This was a re-release of the US version, there was 2 versions of Teknoman ""tekkaman"" 1st release the main character Teknoman went by Slade, but the re-release they changed it to blade. My guess the 1st release was a miss-translation of the name. ^^ good luck finding it. use to come on UPN in the early 90's. other than that is a awsome anime series"
5,The Greatest of the Cypress Hill,"This cd has to be one of the greatest hardcore rap cds there is. This was the first hip hop cd I ever heard. It turned me on to the world of hip hop. If you are trying to figure out which cd to buy, buy this one you wont be disapointed."
1,I love Cindy; this video was not her best,"If you love Cindy as much as I do, get her videos produced by 10 Minute Solution instead. You'll find the production quality and sound to be much better, and you'll use it more often."
2,Criminal Minds With deep gash on disc,Came packaged as brand new but had a deep gouge on disc four. We tried to run it through our disc repair unit but it wouldn't fix. A good part of the episode skipped and froze making it hard to capture the content. This is not the normal quality we have gotten from Amazon with our numerous purchases. We will continue to use Amazon because of our track record with them but are unhappy with this purchase.
5,Amazing Show,Absolutely love it!! It arrived in a timely manner. I spent the weekend watching all the episodes that I missed in Season 7. Its so gripping once I start watching it is so hard for me to stop. I love the actors its such an amazing show. I love the profiling and I love the bond between each of the characters.
1,Good series but poor product.. Cant find a place to leave feedback,"Hey. Bought new. Looks like it was shipped used.Package arrived and box was worn. Plastic cover was loosely placed around box and kind of looked like someone tried to reclose it. Outer package appears clean and in good shape.Not sure what happened and haven't found a place to commentFirst time out of several buys.And yes, significant other has been waiting and doesnt want me to just return itGuess i will have to see if it works"
5,Criminal minds seventh season,"I never get disappointed when it comes to Criminal minds. I am very pleased that ""JJ"" is back. I missed her when she got off the show for a while in the sixth season."
3,But the show itself is excellent!,"Explanation of the star rating:I'd just like to know how a ""New still in the wrap"" DVD set has a badly worn box and case inserts? Thank God the disks are undamaged, but I am less than pleased with the rest. Anyone else get a set like this? Perhaps a printing accident at the factory? Just wonderingBut Criminal Minds shows another award-winning season with this DVD release! Absolutely the best crime drama on TV, hands down! I liked the extras on the DVD, showing how some shows went from concept to creation, and the gag reel!Quoth the Raven"
4,Wouldn't Live Without It,"okay...probably an overstatement, but to some extent, as a Rhapsody customer, I'd simply not have one without the other. It's worked well since day one (it occasionally requires a power-cycle), and sounds good (to my non-audiophile ear). If you've come this far (early adopter!) I think you should give it a whirl, you'll not likely be disappointed.While i've not tried other similar products, I can say that I can think of any way that it could be improved."
4,Excellent for home use,I really like this machine--it was a breeze to set up and now I can send all my Mp3 files to my home computer. Simple! You might have to experiment a little with the channels. I also noticed that having other appliances running (my dryer!) seemed to interfere and force me to change channels. However it transmits directly through 2 walls! I am happy with this purchase!
5,Simple Setup Great Sound!,"I took it out of the box and plugged it into my computer in my den then walked upstairs into my living room and plugged it into my stereo receiver. Back again downstairs to my computer, I'm already a subscriber to Musicmatch so I punched in one of my play lists and walked back up into the living room to crystal clear music pounding out of my substantialy more powerful stereo speakers."
1,Ph.d student from Georgia Tech,Two comments:1. Content is not up-to-date.2. Too much complicated maths without explaination.
5,nice and quiet,"I got this unit after reading a review in a magazine stating it is quiet, and it is just that, drives all my nailing guns with no prob, and you can actually talk to someone while its running. its a nice unit, i'm happy"
1,A Disappointment,"Bought this air compressor to use with some trim nail guns. Worked great right up to the moment it started leaking air around the piston. With a DeWalt Emglo, I thought that I was buying quality. I got less service out of it than I did a previous cheap one from Harbor Freight (about a quarter of the price). Motor still looks new, but won't hold air. Don't buy this one."
1,OVERRATED,"I was very excited to read this book upon seeing the reviews ... I was sorely disappointed. Being in China has absolutely no relevance to this girl's life ... her experiences seem similar to any American teenager attending school. She is middle-class, rebellious, a bit lost in her teen years ... not exactly the most unique and interesting story."
3,No more VHS,"Greaat product, except that so far I cant find dvd of same.I stopped doing VHS many years ago, and am currently in a project to dump anything VHS that has a dvd or cd of it.AS it is, Im finding half of my 'minds eye collection' to be only vhs.Bummer, it doesnt matter how cool the stuf is if its not on dvd/cd.I might consider copying the vhs to dvd eventualy, but havent had a vhs player for many years.Im still researching non-vhs possibilities, so Im hopeful."
4,Low voltage light timer,Perfect replacement for Malibu light timer at a reasonable price. Works just like the old one did before it broke.
4,Garden light and water feature control,"This power pack and timer is very good,used to control low voltage external lights and water feature. It is very robust in construction and weather proof, can be located near to the feature and depending on the wattage of the lights, different Power Packs can be supplied.Unable to locate manufaturer in the uk,this item is made in the USA, only down side is the cost of postage, other than that it is a very good product."
5,Best Buy,"After 8 years of service my Intermetic timer failed and when I could not find a replacement in the local big box stores, I went to Amazon's web site and found exactly what I wanted. The price was right and it arrived the very next day. I call it ""My Best Buy in 2011"""
5,Malibu ML 88T,"I am 80 years old, and I had no problem attaching 2 wires to activate this timer. I had the same timer for 20 years, and I just now needed to replace it. It is Great, and the price was Great too. I purchased this timer from Amazon."
4,Delightful little chuckle of a leg puller,"What a simple little book full of whimsy and fable! What a charming character, this Big Fish of a dad is! And such a set of schtick and tricks are here, with a hint of Mel Brooks, Sholem Aleichem, Carl Reiner, Danny DeVito echoing through the delivery of lines like, ""I'm dying here!"" One has to be totally calloused to not chuckle out load. Shades of ""Princess Bride"" and all the other great mythology of filmdom! No wonder this Daniel Wallace tale has been translated to cinema. And I will enjoy the movie version more since I have read the novel base.It is hard to believe that this father is merely an Alabaman, from Ashland, no less. The twists and turns of his story are much more universal than the modern world. In fact, the father's adventures seem more like tales from the old country, wherever that may have been.Read it and lift your winter spirits. And then, like me, make a trip to the nearest movie house and indulge in the cinematic interpretation."
1,"Ugh, this was a bore to get through!","I picked up this book as a recommendation from someone working at my local Barnes & Nobles. It started out sort of cute, funny little stories about someone's life. The problem was, that was all that it was - just a series of short little stories, tall tales actually. It did not go anywhere, did not develop, nothing. It would be fine for a bathroom read, but it just did not hold my interest. In fact at one point, I had 30 pages left in the entire book and I literally had to force myself to finish it, just skimmed it, and read to the end.This book will be going in my pile to resell to Half Price books and I will not be passing it on to anyone. Hope this is helpful information."
3,Ehhh...,"I had heard great things about this book, but I can honestly only give a 3 because I just wasnt captivated by it! The stories I felt were too short at times - I would have loved to read expanded versions. However, I will say that it is a moving story and one that has great emotional passages.While many might disagree, the movie did a splendid job of bringing the images of the novel to life. I would watch the movie over and over but could do without a 2nd read."
3,"A good, quick read that differs from the movie version.","I saw the movie adaptation of this book and really liked it. I liked the fairy tale feel and over the top fantasy of it.Since movies are rarely as good as the books they are based on I had high hopes for the book by Daniel Wallace. After reading the book I was left a little disappointed.The movie was loosely based on the book - many of the sub stories in the movie were not in the book at all (parachuting into enemy territory, the werewolf, etc). This didn't effect the main point of the story but I felt like I was missing pages as I read.The movie version also flowed better from one sub story to the next in my opinion. A quick snippet in a movie feels better to me than a chapter consisting of one or two paragraphs. In book form it just feels choppy.This is one case in which I would reccomend the movie over the book."
4,Storyteller's Tale...,"Although it doesn't feel like a ""novel"", it most certainly is story of ""mythic proportions."" If you enjoy reading for a pure ""storytelling"" aspect (similar to fables, tall tales, etc.), then this is certainly the book. It's a quick read which seems like, above all, an Ode to Fathers. I really enjoyed the development of certain jokes (all of which were very PG and had a GREAT ""granfather-like"" feel to them). A very nice tale all together.Say, did you hear the one about... : )"
4,Review,The product was as described and received in a timely manner. One of the DVDs was slightly scratched and did not work in a couple places.
4,Jarod 24/7,"Finally, The pretender has hit the DVD section. I have every episode copied on VHS but it is nice not to have to fast forward through commericals. The only down side is the double doing of the DVDs. They use both sides and the extras suck royaly. I am hoping that as the DVDs and the story progress, the extras will get better. I am personally hoping for a walk through Centre and even a map of Jarod's journeys. They used to have a lot on the website and the DVDs would be the perfect place for all that great knowledge."
5,Finally Jarod's on DVD,"Finally we see The Pretender on DVD. This is the series based on a boy named Jarod who was stolen from his family as a young child by The Centre. After he escapes as an adult he goes from one episode to another helping people and keeping one step ahead of The Centre's Miss Parker, Sydney and Broots.This DVD has all the season 1 episodes, 2 featurettes (One making of behind the scenes which is done in three parts - very good documentary as well), audio commentary and subtitles in English and Spanish!One disapointment - the discs have been burnt on both sides so they don't have a picture of the characters on them - I think it would have been better to have one sided burnt discs - but that's just me."
5,Love at first sight,"I love this series, i have all the series plus the telimovies. You dont want to stop wathcing all the different characters he becomes and the chase between the Center and Jarod is always right behind him. Well worth buying if your a fan."
2,Has not worn well for me,"I've recently been listening through my TD collection, with 'fresh ears' as best I can, to see what gems I may have missed. This CD falls flat for me. There seems to be little of the mystery and tension which marks the best of TD's music, and the heavy, 'ratta-tat' percussion is distracting. This one will probably stay on the shelf for another few years."
4,Nice Black and White (for most part) document,"I watched the video of it when I was in college. I had to write and present a paper on the document in class. Now, I became a French teacher and I chose to buy this DVD. I have NOT had a chance to show it in class yet to my high school students. The doc is a bit outdated, but with warning to students, I think they will be open minded and enjoy the video."
5,Bring that Beat Back,"I guess the only way you get to be a top 50 reviewer is by the amount of reviews you write, not the quality. Mistermaxx has written 5,000+ reviews, and about 25% of them make sense. Please use a spell and grammar checker in the future. Also, how can you slag PE as a ""plantation act"" when two of your favorite artists are Michael Jackson and R. Kelly? PE has kept it real for a lot longer than these two were delving into underage deviance. They continue to do so on ""New Whirl Odor"". While not quite the dense production of the Bomb Squad, PE branches out with their band and spit fire on tracks like the title track, ""Revolution"", and ""Makes Ya Blind"". Chuck D has never, and will never go ""bling"". This CD (music only) is currently 6.99 at Best Buy, the best bargain in the hip-hop world at the moment. Get it and learn."
5,Works perfectly,It is easy to start and adjust the flame. Have used the trigger ones but this is better to actually use.
2,Make this Gadget's Last case,"Inspector Gadget's Last Case - Claw's Revenge is almost as bad as the both of the live action Gadget movie. Instead of an anti-gadget as in the first movie, you have a so-called crimefighter who tries his best to best Gadget at his crimefightingA few things make this Gadget incomplete. As much as I love Maurice LaMarche (from Pinky & The Brian) trying to step into Don Adams's Gadget shoes..,THERE is NO ONE else that can do Gadget like Adams! The script seems disjointed and disappointing. And Penny is giving too little to do in this movie to save it all !So dont get this and get the Original Gadget TV stuff with AdamsBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
5,"Honest, Unbiassed, and Challenges the Popular Notion","Despite the many detractors of this book, this book is a wonderful and honest piece on the current situation regarding Palestine and Israel. All the facts are documented, and character attacks put out by the reviewers before me show the brainwashed and rejectionist mentality that effects western academia and media. This book goes well with Norman Finkelstein's book Image and Reality of the Israeli Palestinian Conflict and Fateful Triangle by Noam Chomsky. It seems that whenever scholars or people speak out against the unlawful practices of the Israeli government, people are labeled as anti semites and this and that. This cant be applied to this author or noam chomsky or norman finkelstein. All of them are Jews and all of them have documented the evidence. So instead of attacking this book based on rejectionist literature and models, confirm it from the sources its drawn on"
1,never received product that i overpaid for and i am pissed,"i placed 2 orders1 = 2 vera wang 13 oz @ approx $9.oo ea = i recieved these...:)it's good1 = 1 vera wang 13 oz @ approx $23.00 ea which i thought i deleted, but didn't and i have never received it so i can send it back and i am pissed.so...i'm leaning on the never 2 purchase online again side of this issue, i can just go to the store instead..one day maybe i'll receive the 2nd order...who knows...602-565-8037"
1,Hit piece against a godly woman,Another in a line of hit-pieces against a godly woman who is telling the truth on the Bible versions issue. What a waste of paper.
4,Digested Beans,This is a compiled digest of the antics of Rowan Atkinson's long suffering and silent character Mr. Bean. It's a great piece of work but one wonders when the entire uncut series will be available on DVD? Hardcore fans may want to wait until the producers finally get around to it. These snippets just leave you wanting more!
5,"Fantastic, diverse collection of latin rythms and love songs","This duo is great! This particular cd has a lot of upbeat rythms and even a tinge of reggae sounds along with fantastic lyrics about life and love. They are even getting some assistance with backup vocals from a good friend of theirs whom we can all recognize....the master of love balads...Julio Iglesias. I also have their latest release ""De Hombre A Mujer"" which gets as equally a great rating (5+ stars). If you enjoy latin rythms and love songs...buy their material..they're great at what they do. I am now a loyal fan...thanks Donato & Estefano!!!"
3,It is not as flexible as I expected,"The product description says: ""Yellow jacket cords are more flexible and abrasion resistant at any temperature than standard vinyl compounds"".I tested the flexibility claim of the YJ cord vs. a cheap vinyl Christmas extension cord at room and 40 F temperatures. NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE!I also have ""Yellow Jacket 2882 12/3 15-Amp SJTW Contractor 2-Foot Extension Cord"", which is very flexible at any temperature. The jacket material of the 2-foot cord is definitely different than the one used on the 25-foot cord. The only common thing is that they are both colored yellow ;-).The consequence of the lack of flexibility is that once deployed, the YJ cord does not lay flat on the floor and is a tripping hazard."
4,Great stuff for the science-minded cook,"Fascinating exploration into the physics of cooking, written in an engaging and detailed style. Probably better for the scientist who cooks than for the cook who's into science, since the language is sometimes a little dense for the layperson. Worth working through, though, if only for the gorgeous and elegant formula for figuring out how long to boil your eggs to get them EXACTLY right.One caveat: the author is British, and recipes, measurements, and terms are geared for the British/European cook. This means you'll find a complete explanation of sausage rolls and nothing about popcorn. Just FYI."
4,Works fine for me...,"$30 is $30...i haven't had any problems with mine. Everything seems to work good so far (about a month), and as for the problems that last person had: i think you have to hit stop to turn it off so it doesn't waste batteries? and i haven't had any of the other problems he/she discussed. all in all, for $30 (when it's $60 at wal-mart) - i'm going to go out on a limb here - you can't go too wrong!"
4,RCA2365 going on three years,"I have had this personal cd player for about two and a half years and have never had a problem with it. I bought it primarily for the price and the ""goodies"" that came with it (ie: car kit, power cord) and I am very satisfied with it. I guess if you take care of things they will last a long time."
2,"Ew, Martha!","Let me say up front -- I LOVE Martha Stewart. I shouldn't have been surprised by this book, but I was. Everything is lovely, but it's so pale, almost to the point of being colorless. I found very few ideas I can work into our busy, colorful home, but that's not Martha's fault. Maybe I should go back to Mary Engelbreit."
1,RCA Support I Abominable,"2 Lyras broke at the same time. RCA support required me to send them back at my own expense for replacements promised back to me 10 days from the day RCA received them. After 27 days from the day they received them, I decided to call for the status. They said they were backordered with no delivery date in site. I requested my money back. They said the could not start a request until exactly 30 days have elapsed. They said IF a refund was approved it would take 8 to 10 weeks to process the check.Now I'm out $280 including tax and shipping without even having the units in hand for paperweights or skeet targets.Also tech supoprt said it supports 1 gig sd cards but aftger testing many brands and sizes I found it only supports 256k cards.DONT BUY RCA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,GARBAGE!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!,Doesn't even deserve the one star!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present last year. It never worked at all. RCA support SUCKS!! I spent hours on the phone with RCA & didn't get anywhere. I always thought RCA made good products but have learned otherwise from this miserable experience. I sent this product back to RCA for a refund about a month ago & haven't heard anything. I will feel lucky if I do get a refund after reading these reviews. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER RCA/THOMSON PRODUCT AS LONG AS I LIVE & WOULD ADVISE ANYONE WHO READS THIS TO DO THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF BEATING YOUR HEAD AGAINST A WALL IS FUN FOR YOU THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.
3,Can Anyone compare the Apple iPod to The RCA Lyra A/V,"Disregard the stars...Sorry people this is not a review, but I didnt know how else to get peoples attention on this. I wanted to know how this compares to the Apple iPod becuase I have the 20GB iPod and I ordered this as well. I know that with this product you can watch videos and such, but as far as dependebility and study-ness how does it look? Because with the iPod there are no moving parts (except the button which you flip to lock the buttons) and that means that there is not risk of ""breaking"" the iPod (except if it accidentally hits the flor from a high enough place). SO if anyone can post a review which tackles this question I would greatl appricieate it. And again sorry for me posting it in the review section"
1,MUSICMATCH made in Hell,MusicMatch is the worst software EVER. Do NOT support RCA MP3 products until they support drag and drop. Install MusicMatch and YOU'LL BE SORRY!Drag and drop is available on all iRiver MP3 players.
2,Lyra is a good looking piece of Junk,"The Lyra is a great concept. Storing vidio, audio, and pictures display. The reality is that the product is not fully functional. So don't expect to have the features that will make it useable. You will constantly see ""this feature will be availabe in a future release"". The user interface is clunky and there are a number of file formats that are not useable. If you try to contact Thomson (RCA) to find out when updates will be available they will tell you nothing. It can only be surmised that the promised updates will never be available.When you install the basic operating software expect to be pushed marketing information. Buy this subscription, this software upgrade, and on and on. This product is a nice looking incomplete marketing night mare.Save your money"
3,An average product,"It's inexpesive but the overall features are good. It's playback features are O.k given the fact that the micropone does not catch the sounds around you very well. I would not recommend it for lectures, business meetings etc, but it's just the product for you when you just want to get your thoughts on tape or make notes."
1,Uncomfortable mattress,"These are very uncomfortable mattresses. The mattress sinks in the middle and when laying on it you can feel every dimple and valve. I added more air and it did not get any better. I had stacked two mattresses on top of each other to get some height off the floor during my bedroom remodel. I tried sleeping on one mattress right on the floor, thinking it required more solid support underneath, still uncomfortable. I tried to sleep on it different ways before giving up and going back to my single air mattress. I guess that I just lost the money on this purchase, because my 30 days are up. This is no fault of Amazon because all of my other purchases have been super!"
4,Great Quality,"I got this for camping, beach trips, sleeping in my living room while my lil cousins slept over and watch movies. It does not come with a pump so keep this in mind; however, the matress is very comfortable and made of good material."
5,"Fun, Fast Read","This IS a fun, fast, light and entertaining read at least if you are into corporate murder and retribution. The protagonists are skilled and expert and the bad guys are bad. Great for a rainy day with nothing else to do (or when you are looking for an excuse not to do something). Started it in the morning, couldn't put it down and finished it handily by the afternoon. The writing is skilled and easily readable. Will I buy the next in the series - you bet!"
1,NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD/VHS...unless all you want is a documentary on the Clancy brothers. Unlike what the Amzon listing & advertisments suggest, this is only a documentary. There is very little concert footage at all (just small portions of the reunion concert). The documentary is decent for a diehard fan...but make sure you realize that you are only getting a documentary that runs less than the 60 mins the details suggest. While the documentary is somewhat intersting...you are only getting a documentary with a little concert footage."
4,good value,"i am suprised at rca this time. in the past, they made some very ""clunky"" looking products... out of all the dvd players i looked at before purchasing, this one was the most elegant and streamlined. setup is a breeze and the menu & remote are very straight-forward. good value and simplicity"
5,Loved it so much I bought another,"Gave it to my brother - not because the first one broke! I've had it for a year now - and not ONCE did it ever give me a problem - watch the matrix regularly. I get rental DVD's (more scratched - usually ""more difficult to play"") about twice a week - and in the last 6 months of renting so frequently I have never had a disc that gave me a problem.Overall, I think there's no reason to buy a more expensive DVD player - like cd players, they're one and the same unless you're really descriminate about quality or features not detectable to an average consumer."
3,"Good dvd player, most of the time.","This dvd player is cheap for a reason. You get what you pay for. Most of the time this player works fine. But sometimes the picture will cut out and give you just a blue screen. You can sometimes just tap the machine and it comes back on, other times you have to stop the movie and open the tray just to get rid of the blue screen. Luckily this doesn't happen that often. If you don't have a lot of money to spend on a dvd player, go for it, but if you can spend more i would recommend something on the higher end of the scale."
1,Stay away from RCA,"This player has major problems with certain disks. It can't even begin to play John Carpenter's Vampires. ""The Matrix"" (dual layer disk) gets about half way through, then only plays every other chapter. The player's computer software(firmware) loses it's mind all too often even on disks it has previously played causing the ""incompatible disk message"" which requires resetting the player by unplugging it. If you play back movies using the Dolby Digital sound setting you get periodic pops in the soundtrack and times when the sound goes away for a few seconds. I have to say overall it has been a very pathetic DVD player thus proving once again that ""you get what you pay"". If you have one of these players and think it's great, just wait over time with more movies played you will change your mind!"
4,Awesome music. Poor recording.,"This CD sounds great in my car with the volume pumped up. But on my high-end and expensive stereo at home it shows how poor the recording is. Still, this is a must-have CD."
4,Black Album Catches the Ears,"Metallica's self-titled album was a shot in the dark for me. I bought it because I love Apocalyptica and wanted to hear the originials of some of their songs. I ended up pretty much a new Metallica fan, and find myself singing to the Apo songs now-by the by, I recommend Apocalyptica to Metallica fans also-and I found some awesome new songs. I love especially ""Wherever I May Roam,"" ""The Unforgiven,"" ""Nothing Else Matters,"" ""Sad But True,"" ""My Friend of Misery,"" and the non-Apo songs ""The God that Failed,"" and ""Of Wolf and Man."" The last two are really amazing, and ""Of Wolf and Man"" borders on downright creepy at times."
3,"Good, but not a Classic","I mean, i bleed metallica and this was the second metallica cd i ever bought. the songs just got old after awhile, while there are still a few classics on the cd, there is still those songs that you cant help but skip. Metallica is a cd that all metallica fans muct own though."
1,I only have one question,"It's been almost ten years, haven't they apologized for this thing yet? I agree with that other dude, they should have renamed themselves POPllica. Kudos dude!"
3,Turned me off from Metallica.,Imagine Winston Churchill doing used-car ads; that's what this album did for Metallica.It cheapened the legacy of a super-band. I can't worship this golden statue of metal-dom after its feet of clay have been exposed.
4,Sad But True,"No album is loved and hated by so many. Loved by music lovers that appreciate the brilliance and genius of this landmark album. Hated by true Metallica fans who insist the band sold out and will never be convinced otherwise. As for me, this is still the only Metallica album I own, but if ""Enter Sand Man,"" ""Sad But True,"" ""Unforgiven,"" ""Wherever I May Roam"" and ""Nothing Else Matters"" are selling out, then every band should sell out immediately. This is a fantastic album even if it doesn't satisfy everyone."
1,This CD does not live up to its hype!,"For all of the hype surrounding Metallica's self-titled CD, it did not live up to its full potential. This CD lacked the traditional ""hardcore"" lyrics that Metallica performs so well. It is my belief that this is a CD that Metallica should have never released!"
1,"can you say, sell out?","metallica used to be a amazing metal band. great solos on guitar, awesome double bass drums, you could hear a bass guitar, cds like master of puppets, ride the lightning, and other old ones are incredible. But now i dont hear good solos, hardly any, the songs are shorter, no double bass. metallica now isnt in it for the love of music, they just want money, and if thats why ur gonna write music, then dont do it at all. SELLOUTS"
1,Sell Out!,"The Early 90's were a horrible time for music, we saw the death of so many bands that once had something to say, but decided that money was more important. I couldn't believe this piece of garbage when I first heard it. Childrens nursery rhymes: Great. Metal died in 1991."
1,Weak castrated radio metal,"This album is for anyone who does not like angry thrash metal and more poppy type tunes such as ""Enter Sandman"".Its Metallica with its fangs removed and turned into a radio friendly hard rock sound.There are a few good songs such as My Friend of Misery, The God that Failed and maybe one or two other songs but really, if you want speed metal thrash you must go older, matter of fact everything they released after this album is garbage too.I do not mind when bands change but really Metallica jumped about 20 sharks and they have become a joke in the metal scene.Get Master or Justice... Forget this album was ever made."
1,Bon Voyage Metallica,"This was the last Metallica album I bought, and the first I sold to a crappy second-hand CD store. It's beyond bad. And yes, I'm one of the many fans who feels betrayed by this album. The four best albums ever made were followed up by a tragically unoriginal, poppy, nonsensical album featuring crooning, weak riffs and radio-friendly lyrics.I have since moved on to real metal - Slayer is still doing it, a lot of new bands coming up, including Shadows Fall and Mudvayne are doing it - but Metallica?As a band, they died the day this album hit the shelves."
2,From a long time Metallica Fan and Metal expert,"After Metallica released this album, it told me one thing-They are getting old and tired. The only time after that when actually go back to the hard and heavy is during Garage Inc. But like most hardcore metal fan would say is that they are playing covers and not anything new they have written. For real Punk Heavy Metal pass this album and buy Master of Puppets."
5,Rock On,"First off, let me say this to all you ""Sell Out!"" people- I H-A-T-E MTV, yet I love this album. I could care less if Carson Daley or whatever abnoxious twit VJ they have on now played the videos from ""Metallica"" 24/7 for the rest of my life. I would still love this album.Yes, the songs are shorter. Yes, the lyrics may be a little more mainstream than Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. So what? Do bands HAVE to be off the mainstream to be good? Of course not. James, Jason, and Kirk are still three of the best guitarists in history, and the same goes for drummer Lars Ulrich.The Black Album is a good album. I love nothing more than to sit around the house and crank up the volume on this heavy metal classic.This thing didn't sell millions of copies for nothing, you know."
3,Too much noise about nothing,"This CD received too much poublicity, I don't know why. It really marked the beginning of MEtallica's change of sound (to worst), The only reason it really sold so good was because they smartly passe many years without releasing a studio album, and this one was greatly expected. Ah, I'll be damned if the guy who signed ""James Hetefield"" below is really Hetfield. He wouldn't write so lousy!"
2,The Beginning of the End,"This album was long anticipated, it came out, and anyone who was already a fan of Metallica had to be disappointed, I know I was.....this is the beginning of the end, forget anything after this point......"
3,Okay but not Good not Great,Okay folks a lot of people here are too left or too right either saying its the worst or the best. Sorry the title of best belongs to Master of Puppets and the worst belongs Load or even Reload. This is not that bad. Although not up to par with say Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning its got few great songs. The Unforgiven is probably there best song they ever recorded. But hey this is just one person opinion.
5,Metallica - Metallica GETS YOU PUMPED FOR ANY OCCASION!,"WHAT A HOT CD! Wether you are driving, skiiing, partying, or getting hot-n-heavy with your honey, this CD gets you pumped. I highly reccomend it for anyone who wants some serious move music. ROCK AND ROLL at its finest."
2,Enter Sandman is the Only Good Song,"Listen, I was born when this came out and Enter Sandman is one of my favorite songs. It just rocks. I will give this CD 2 stars because I love Enter Sandman and it is one of my favorite early ninties songs."
1,never received this cd from the seller,I never received the cd from this seller. I have not received a response to where my cd is? It has been 6 weeks since I placed the order.
5,Excelent way to remember simpler times,"although science says this cant sound better than cd, listen to metalica in vinyl is an experience I recommend. For me is way better"
1,What has been said has been said,"I hate this album and I don't feel like I need to review it. All criticisms have already been made. Too bad a band that was so rad could be so lame. This is sad, why did they have to sell out."
1,Nope,"I don't like it. Why all the hype about Metallica? There isn't one thing special about them, just slow, boring music on this one. However, there are worse Metallica albums called Load and Re-Load. I'm sorry, but Metallica is very overrated."
5,The Black Album Is Metallica's Last Masterpiece,"For me, and many other fans, Metallica died after this self-titled album. While much of the song construction is much different than it's predecessors, the Black Album doesn't fail to disappoint. Shorter songs overall DON'T mean worse. The lyrics aren't as good as ""And Justice For All,"" but they still stand out more than their newer titles such as ""St. Anger."" I can't stress of how great the guitar work is in this album, and it could quite possibly contend for the best in all of Metallica's albums. If you're looking to keep on loving Metallica, buy the Black Album and end it there."
1,BORING..THIS BAND IS LOUSY!!,"This is it!! Metallica were one of the most overrated bands of all time. They only made 1 decent song in 'Orion'. Every of their other songs just sound the same. The Black Album was a really lousy album which had some of the lousiest songs in NOTHING ELSE MATTERS, and THROUGH THE NEVER. I mean James Hetfield just screams, he can't sing at all. Don't buy any album from this band. They are lousy. Buy a Dire Straits or Foreigner CD insted.METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS METALLICA SUCKS.METALLICA ARE JUNKBATTERY."
5,STILL THE BEST!,This is by far the best Metallica ever! They proved that they are the best and will always rock!
2,Ahh...my beautiful doormat,"I tend to enjoy this album the most when I need nothing more than a commercially appealing song written in the key of E (there are 12 of them here) and songs with solos that over-utilise the wah pedal (again, there are 12) not to mention a drummer than hits cymbals on unexpected beats (*sigh* this can be found on all 12 tracks here) and PICKED bass guitar (you guessed it).Buy this album. But whatever you do, don't download any songs from it. The poor starving souls who recorded it couldn't possibly be ripped off any more by you, oh cruel one."
3,"Make it stop, please, just make it stop","I can't take it anymore, make Metallica go away. They were never that good to begin with, just something you can slam your head to. Enter Sandman is hideously overplayed. Sad But True is the best song on here and it's so simple a child could write it. That what all of this music is, simple. When they first started, they seemed great and groundbreaking and revolutionary. Eh... it's just mindless head pounding, not good music. They new stuff [is not that good] and this is where they started to go down hill. It gets a lot more credit than it deserves. Yes, this music is great for up beat moods just the guys sitting around drinking beer, but the quality is seriously lacking. This album might have had some redemption if more of the songs were like Unforgiven, their most original song, but the rest just stinks."
5,The best heavy metal CD ever!!!!!,"This is a really cool CD. It has my favorite song on it Enter Sandman,wejwaite@ and a lot of other really cool songs."
2,A Black Eye For Metallica,"I guess if you're new to Metallica this is a great album . If you're a long time fan - it stinks. It's Metallicas attempt to reach a larger audience. If you want to reach a larger audience the first thing you do is sweeten your sound - and thats just what they did. Enter Sandman is a very catchy tune. If your name is Poison or Def Leppard is great to have catchy songs - if your name is Metallica - its a sellout. Sad But True and Unforgiven are.....unforgivable pop songs.The rest of the album , with the exceptions of Of Wolf and Man and Holier Than Thou is kind of bland. And give me break with these lyrics - sounds like something a fourteen year old might wright. The days of Kill Em All , R T L , and M O P are obviously long gone."
2,end of metallica,"This album signaled the beginning of the end for Metallica. No other band in history ""sold out"" worse than they did, and this was the start. Boring songs, boring riffs, boring album. This band died with Cliff Burton."
5,Fits perfectly and arrived as promised!,The basket was a perfect fit for my turkey fryer. I used it to fry fish for a family reunion and it did the job well. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
4,Go to go,"I bought this item as suggested by Amazon to deep fry a Turkey fro Thanksgiving. Fits perfect in the Bayou Classic 3066A 30-Quart Outdoor Turkey Fryer Kit. But at last minute I decided not to use so I can not really say how it works. But looks like it will be fine for use. The only bad thing I thought was that when the middle part that came with the deep fryer doesn't click to connect, so if you pull using the accessory basket handle you will leave the middle piece for the deep fryer inside."
4,Finally- a book where Oz says more than 2 words!,"This may not be the BEST Buffy book out there (try The Evil that Men Do or the Gatekeeper Trilogy for that), but it is definitely worth the time and money if you're an Oz fan. This is the long-overdue book that takes much from Oz's point of view. It is filled with suspense, action, humor, and a good story line, and does a good job of drawing parallels with mentors between kevin/daniel and Dingoes/Alyssa. Plus, did I mention Oz is a main character? ABOUT TIME!"
1,Cheap and lack luster,"Tie was made of an extremely cheap fabric and poorly sewn together. Stitching was horrendous, extremely noticeable and terrible. Silver? Please. It's more like a grey, severely lacking in luster and shine. Would not recommend, it was so terrible I actually returned it to the seller for a refund. If I could rate this zero stars I would have."
1,Worst mp3 player on the market,"I purchased the RCA lyra mini-jukebox six months ago for $200 and it has entirely and completely died on me. I contacted RCA about a replacement and they were unhelpful and unfriendly in addressing my problem. Their only solution was to pay $60 to have the unit replaced, with no guarantee of how long the unit would last after that. I would never purchase this product again, as it was slow, had terrible sound quality, was difficult to use while doing anything active, and came with terrible software. I will never purchase anything RCA made again, and I hope readers of this will never purchase this product."
1,I love it - but it has to go,"This is the 2nd RCA lyra jukebox that I will be returning to the store today - within a two week span. The first one I had - the hard drive crashed within 3 days and could not be reset (only had 20 - 30 songs on it). I went to the store and exchanged it for the same player thinking that it had been damaged during shipping, but here it is less than a week later and this one has done the same thing. So I think I will try a different brand this time around. I wish it wouldn't keep crashing because I really liked the sound of it, but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do."
5,Great Product,This is a great product with a fantastic amount of storage for such a small device. To get this amount of storage with a flash based system would cost a fortune. The big hard drive based MP3 players are BIG.This is the right storage at the right physical size. Store a whole CD collection in something about the size of a pager.Cool!!
4,Good basic recorder,"I bought this tape recorder for use as a study aid, and it has performed very well for this purpose. I like the fact that it uses full size cassette tapes, as they are readily available, and can be played back on any standard player. I have made several tapes, and have played them back in different decks with good results. The only thing I would recommend is the addition of an external microphone, as the internal mic seems to be too sensitive. It actually picks up noise from the tape drive mechanism. If this unit cost a lot of money, this would be a serious flaw, but for just over twenty bucks it didn't seem like a big deal to me. I picked up a decent mic at Radio Shack for around ten dollars, and recording quality is now flawless."
2,wrong songs,my kids didnt know the songs and I wasnt able to even view which songs were on the cd before I purchased it.
4,Our family's reference,"This book written, compiled and edited by Donna Hopkins Scott was clearly a labor of love for all the Crockett descendents of Thomas Crockett and those Crocketts who migrated to Utah in 1849. It has information about all the families that followed including photos. This is the family reference book printed by the BYU Press in Provo, UT 1968. Bound in dark blue with an index. Obviously limited copies since this was a private printing for families and family members that existed in 1968."
2,Over-Rated Bar Band,"I admit that I fell for the hype when I bought this CD. When I listened to the CD, I questioned myself. So, I went to see them recently in Milwaukee. Final verdict: they're a very able bar band with a transparently obvious set of influences."
5,A Good One,"I have long been an admirer of Marah's excellent Kids in Philly CD. Now, after repeated listenings, I'm giving this one the nod as this band's best. Focused, reckless, serious & fun all at the same time."
1,Don't Make the Same Mistake that I Did,CD player broke almost immediately. Poor radio reception. I was always accidentally turning the volume up WAY too high. I'm very glad to be replacing this purchase.
1,The Flexiskin Tears easily,"I've ruined two of these cases -- the first tore on the bottom as I was putting it on the case.Replaced it, and the second one tore at the top.I even complained to Boxwave but only got a form email as a result."
5,rocks,really good all around and not even a single complaint.if only it came in pink it would be perfect
4,Good all around product...,"Product was as advertised and item arrived when expected. Appears to be well built, although I would prefer some side pockets because I'm a road warrior and take so many gadgets with me when I travel. Overall I would have to say that it's a good value and it's built to last."
5,Best of two worlds,My JanSport Driver 8 is a USED one I got on Amazon. I suppose you could say it's been around the block... I fumigated it.Mine seems to be well made. Fairly good materials. The handle is intact and extends/retracts as it should. It is long enough when extended. It seems to be well anchored to the pack! The pack is light weight. It has good wheels that spin freely but they show signs of wear. They appear to be replaceable. The pack is just about the right size too.The shoulder straps store in a pouch until needed. Mine will see action on a trip across Southern Europe in 2012. We travel as cheaply as possible!I give it 5 stars because though it is used it is still in good shape!
5,best rolling backpack ever!,"This will hold two of my binders, two large textbooks and still room for my laptop and my lunch. There is room in front for pens and odds and ends and the large wheels will roll over just about anything without mishap. The only downside is that sometimes when I really load it up, it looks like there is too much pressure on the zipper, so I'm careful."
1,The handle broke off after 1 week,The handle just came out of the slot after 1 week of use. I would think that these backpacks should be sturdy enough to last at least on school year.I would not waste my money on this product.
5,THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ,"I'm not giving nothing at all away, so don't expect it. You'll have to read this for yourself. All I'll say is this book was off the chain!!!!!!!!!!!! GO BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!! Props to Darrin Lower-Smith for this entertaining, suspensful, read."
2,Pieces don't stick,"I bought this for my niece since I remember LOVING colorforms when I was little. I was really disppointed when she tried to use it. None of the pieces really stuck to the background. I am sure she didn't mind so much but I would imagine it will be a headache picking up all the ""stickers"" for her mom."
1,Miss Weather Dress-Up,"Lets start by saying that this item is over-priced. Miss Weather is very limited. How much better if there were: at least three pages, many outfits, backgrounds, and objects. Miss Weather Dress-Up leaves little to the imagination. This is an item that offers little."
5,"Small player, big memory","I got this mp3 player last month at July 4th. I was amazed when I bought it, it was better than I thought! It is so small that you will not feel uncomfortable when you put it in your pocket, with the MP3PRO encoder, I could hold more than 50 songs. One thing that's really cool is the DSPs which most of other players do not have, making the music better. There are 5 DSPs: Flat/Bass/Pop/Rock/Jazz. One thing that's really bad is the way they tell you how to use the Music Match Jukebox. They tell you the way that it seemed to be very simple but it made it even more difficult. After about 3 hours I had figure out that I could simply drag and drop like other folders. Then I went to Yosemite and brought the MP3 player along, since the trip takes about three hours, I listened to it for the whole trip and back, it still got half battery left!"
1,Bought 2 and both had problems so i had to return at my expense,"I purchased 2 of these refurb units for my daughters for xmas. One would not read from its internal memory and the other worked for about 24 hours and the next time I tried to connect to it and add more songs, the USB communications would not function and would actually hang my PC. It wasn't my PC because I could disconnect it, then plug the other one in which would communicated fine. I have also had other RCA Thompson products (Lyra Portable Media Players to be more specific) and should have known better because I also had big problems with those devices. As well their tech support is also pretty much non-existent so I highly recommend trying out another brand."
1,Disappointed from beginning to end,"When I opened this peice of crap on Christmas day, I was disappointed to find that it wasn't an ipod. As the package tells you, you can fit 4 hours of music on this. THIS IS A TOTAL LIE. Even after compressing all of my files of music, I could only fit about an hours worth of music on it. Besides this inconvenience, the earphones are an uncomfortable piece of crap, and the mp3 player itsef is anything but durable. Take my advice and don't bother buying this unless you only like a few songs"
4,great product,"i recently bought the rca lyra, it is light weight and very easy to use. The sound quality is quite good too. I was attracted to this product because of the expandable memory and the reasonable price. The only downfall is that there is no backlight."
2,BOUT TO BLOW UP!!!,"I love this little thing, but when battery replacement time came up, the only thing i could say is ""What the *&#@"" When i go to put the same kind of battery in that i had purchased it only played up to 10 songs and would cut out after that. Apparently songs 11-25 are over-exhausting the battery. Also trying a different brand would lead to a total cut-out and wouldnt let me even see what songs i had. Is it just me or did batteries change to different powers but same size??? I would purchase this player again but i know that you will need to get specialized batteries from the company ahead of time, so im not."
1,more of the same old garbage,"when will the U.S. tire of this inane and repugnant""music"", and start listening to something that makes sense?How many no talent,""mad with the world"" racist idiots will get rich bellowing out this garbage before we come to our senses?"
5,The dawn of a PE era!,"I remember buying this record back in 88 and travelling home on the train reading the lyric sheet that went with it, trying to get my brain around rhymes which seemed so deep, powerful, explosive. The music that accompained it delivered in a way I'd never heard before, with both fusing to make a record of such ground-breaking importance that after even ten listens, you could not yet comprehend it on a full scale.15 years on, it's still the best album I've ever bought or heard, with Chuck's voice still blowing everything else out the water. Eminem may be top dog today, but just like Mike Tyson in his prime, when PE were at their best, no one could touch them.Stand out tracks on this LP could well be all of them, with Rebel Without A Pause, Don't Believe The Hype and She Watch Channel Zero being my particular favourites. Produced by the Bomb Squad and everything on this record so tight, it was little wonder that the rap game and music in genre would never be the same again."
5,Yeeeea Boyeee,"Turn it on full blast, drive the neighbours away, and listen to THE BEAT. She Watch Chanel zero is especially cool, and let me tell you ALL these songs are CHARGED WITH PE POWER which is LOUDER THEN A BOMB, Boyeee!! So Bring On The Noise, Show em What you got, and Get this album now!!!"
2,Great and comfortable but..........,"This reclines is as advertised. It is comfortable and great to use.UNTIL a pivot bolt self locking nut backs off and the sholder bolt seperates allowing the chair to come apart causing the frame to bend when you wind up on the floor. This is the bolt that you raise and lower yourself from reclined to sitting positions.BTW this happenerd today 7/25 and the chair was ordered on 5/31The threaded part of the bolt is not lonf enough for the self locking nut to do its job.Today is Sept. 4th 2005 an update on my Lafuma experience.Called two days ago to the Lafuma people asking where my repair parts are, boy did they play dumb. Said I never called about broken chair parts.DO NOT buy this chair based on thier lousy customer service.BTW they said this is a known problem with thire chairs, why then don't they correcxt it."
4,Good bargain; a little fragile,"I bought mine about a year ago and use it for yard work and running. It's a good value for the money and easy to load and all that. The only problem I had with it was a big one - it got knocked out of my hand at the health club and hit the floor. Now the battery compartment won't stay closed. For the money, I guess I can buy another one, but I wish it was a little more durable, considering the ways people will use it."
5,Great Buy,"After doing lots of research into different types of filters, I settled with this canister filter for my 50 gallon freshwater tank. It did take some time to setup and I am not in love with the way the plumbing sits in the tank, but then again, if I wanted to, I could always go out and buy some flex PVC and refit the plumbing myself. As long as your intake is not on top of the air-bubbler, you should have no air in your system. It's very powerful and you definitely notice a difference after a small period of time. I've had no leaks or problems as long as I keep the water level high enough."
5,Imagination,Laurel K. Hamilton is by far my favorite author. She doesn't disappoint in this collection of short stories which reveal the extent of her imagination. Definately recommend!!
2,The Cover Says Nothing...,"Laurell Hamilton can write, but this is a mediocre selection of short stories. And, they published this book with a VERY explicit cover hinting at sex that NEVER arrives. With Laurell Hamilton, well that is false advertising.This book was published to sell on her name ala Stephen King at his top. Like him, they told her to clean out her desk and bring them back anything she had, because everything with her name on it was selling like hotcakes. The stories were mediocre except for a couple good ones, and none had the appreciable sex that people were buying Hamilton for. So, almost like a the exaggeration of a bad liar, they slap the blindfolded woman eating the cherry on the cover. Sheesh.Get it at the library. If you like it so much then, like the other reviewers, then pick up a copy."
5,Good Short Stories,This was one of my early books when I started reading Laurell K. Hamilton. She has great short stories and I wish there was another book like this. A quick read for any of her fans or just fantasy readers. (Though you might need a quick talk about the Anita Blake Series)
2,Not so pleased,"This novel did have a varity of different stories but its not what i like in her writing. I have come to love the new Anita Blake series, There just wasnt enough sexual content for me haha"
5,EXCELLENT TRAVEL BIBLE,I would just like to praise the Cambridge Press for introducing yet another quality produced KJV Bible edition. While the type is a bit small it should not be too hard to read for any one with half way decent eyesight. As to be expected the Bible paper is excellent India quality and the binding and leather cover are superb. Even if subjected to years of hard use this bible should still be servicable. Yes the price is a bit much but if you want quality you will have to pay for it. After all just look at the garbage that cheap American Bible Publishers like Thomas Nelson flog off on the public - Bibles that start falling apart after only weeks of use (this is from personal experience)! Do not cheat yourself! If you want a great long lasting Bible that is a pleasure to own BUY CAMBRIDGE!
5,NICK IS TOO QUICK!,"HOGAN & STING HAD ONE HECK OF A MATCH,AND HOGAN PUT THE LEGDROP ON STING AND EVERYONE SAID THE COUNT WAS TOO FAST INCLUDING NON LICENSED REFEREE (FOR THIS MATCH) BRET HART"
1,worst ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This so called ppv is the worst ppv of all time. I cant beleive that Sting vs. The bald guy was that bad. Wcw kept on lying to us. No cage, no macho, no Kev, no Raven, no show. I would have given it no stars if it would have let me."
1,Terrible...absolutely TERRIBLE!,"There was a ton of buildup for this thing - esp. the Hogan/Sting fiasco - and WCW really dropped the ball. Of course, it probably beat Starrcade '98, which is really sad."
3,culmination of 18 months of build up for hogan/sting,"overall a good show but certain matches stank and it showed the clash of old, knackered stars(luger, hennig, zbysko) with new stars(Malenko, ddp goldberg). luger/bagwell was crap, utter crap. an offf night for all stars in WCW although Malenko, Guerrero and benoit were okay, way under par. A very green goldberg takes on steve Mcmichael. However it all boils down to the biggest match in recent WCW historyhollywood hogan and sting . Its not a total washout and it is a passable match but sting has major ring rust and hogan is not the performer of '89. Worth a look at WCW's most profitable and biggest match of all time"
5,Upcoming birthday present,"This is a birthday gift for my Grandson so I havn't seen it yet. But, I know he will be thrilled as he and his sisters always are with Playmobil.Thankyou for the speedy delivery!"
3,"21 Days, a good National Geo documentary","I bought this, as I have an interest in recent military history. The documentary was well balanced, but a little too sanitized. I guess that it is aimed at the mainstream domestic market, so the level of violence and gore is toned down. However we are dealing with war here and I believe it should be shown in full realism. Good interviews with the military and the shock and awe moments are, well, shock and awe! What it needs is a sequel detailing the total mess we are in now though, but that is a different topic."
2,Mediocre at best,A disappointing CD with little actual combat footage; I found it quite boring and I would not recommend it except for young teenagers or those who are entirely naive to written and photo histories of past US combat operations. For those with military experience there is little if any merrit to this CD.
2,college kid goes to mardi gras,"While the writer does have talent, the story really goes nowhere. If you want to know what's it's like to be a college student getting drunk at Mardi Gras, by all means pick up this book. Otherwise, don't bother. The book is in desperate need of an editor. If this had been cut in half it might have been a decent short story."
2,book in unexpected condition,"The book arrived promptly. However, some of the signatures were falling out which I had not expected."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH SEASON 2 OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE,NOT WITH THE CONTENT,THAT WAS GREAT;HOWEVER, WITH THE WAY IT WAS DELIVERED. SONY - WONDER WENT ON THE CHEAP, THEY DOUBLE RECORDED ON EACH DVD. THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO FLIP EVERY DVD TO SEE THE SHOWS IN ORDER. THAT TO ME IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND NOT MENTION WHEN YOU ORDER OR ON THE BOX. SONY-WONDER SHOULD BE ASHAME OF IT SELF. SEASON 1 WAS ONLY RECORDED ON ONLY ONE SIDE, LIKE IT'S SUPPOSE TO."
5,good,this dvd is so good and funny i love rocky and bullwinkle it is the best show ever. i can hardy want for season 3 to come out.
3,Royal Rumble 03,Brock Lesner vs. Big Show. Not great by any means. But not bad either. Seems like Lesner is the only person that can carry show to a good match. **Dudley BoyZ with a Z vs. Regal and Storm. This match was ok. But Storm needed more CANADIAN VIOLENCE to get a higher rating. **Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie. HORRIBLE. NEVER WATCH THIS MATCH. EVER. -***Scott Steiner vs. HHH. I'm n;ot going to bother explain this match. See above. -***Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit. AWSOME. If you don't like this match your NOT a wrestling fan. ***** stars all the way.Rumble Match. You know the routine. Lesner wins. ****.Buy it JUST for the rumble and Benoit vs. Angle. Skip the rest.
3,this is one of the top 5 wrestling PPV's,Brock Lesner vs. Big Show wasn't a good match it was to short it wasn't a good match. 4/10Dudley Boyz vs. Lance storm and William Regal was a short match but it was worth watching. 7/10Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie wasn't a good match and ist'n worth watching. 3/10Triple H vs. Scott Steiner kinda made the PPV go bad and Scott would have won but Ric Flair had to interfere. 3/10Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit save the PPV from Scott Steiner vs. HHH and should be called match of the year. 10/10The Royal Rumble was one of the best Royal Rumbles i ever saw through out my life. 10/10
3,rumble match and benoit/angle only bright spots in this ppv,brock vs show was a good starttag team match was lousytorrie vs dawn was a bad match 1/10hhh vs steiner the worst match i have ever seenslow stenier used only about 2 moves.angle/benoit a must see match 100/10 won match of the year in 03 i say**without the major superstars this was one of the best entertaining royal rumbles i have seen. exciting from first participant -the 30th only low point was that it was predictable of who was going to win.ppv 4/10
3,Review on Diva Match Only,I only review the diva matches.Torrie Wilson vs Dawn Mariethis match was pretty quick started with Torrie crying and ending with a swinging neckbreaker. over all rate 2 stars
4,How to Take the Grrrr out of Anger,I am finding the book very helpful in understanding children's reactions to situations and finding ways to help them understand their reactions and coping with them.It is a good book for children (upper elementary and middle school) as well as parents of children of all ages.
2,Not what I thought it was,"This book was not what I thought it would be, not so helpful and repetitive reading. Did not help me at all."
1,This book is absurd,"An absurd collection of ""memory party tricks"" which are completely impractical for natural and long term memory development. Spare me all the gimmickry Harry boy!"
4,where did I put that?,"Like a lot of these books and courses, you need to do the tasks they suggest to improve. No point reading how and not persisting. This book outlines tasks, explains the progression clearly, and doesn't get trapped with jargon. If you've bothered to look at the book be bothered to do the homework and you'll improve."
3,Good book on memory,"I have read several books on memory technique and this is one of the more ""complete"" courses. I would highly reccommend Dominic O'Brien's Quantum Memory Power first as the Dominic System is easier to learn and use compared to Mr. Lorayne's."
5,Best practical book on memory ever,"This is an excellent book with a lot of useful insights on how to memorize from names to complex number sequences. As soon as you open the book and start using the methods explained, the results are immediate. Highly recommended for the professional who needs to learn tons of information in a short amount of time."
5,A piece of art,"There are two things I really like about this book:1. Each chapter is small on length and long on meaning2. Not only does it talk about the power of words, every page is an example of how to do it RIGHT!Use this book to get the juices flowing when you feel you are stuck in a rut, or need some inspiration for that next campaign."
5,spirited - mixed with tension,"I'll start with the basics. The production quality of this DVD is very good. The audio is well done; the singer can be understood. The music is well mixed. The filming allows the viewer to watch the performance without any editing distractions.Now, I'll focus on the performance itself. The Circle Jerks put on one hell of a show. There's a palpable tension between the audience and the singer. A couple times, I was expecting afight.The set is rammed through at a blistering pace. At forty, did I feel old and ridiculous watching this performance? Sure, I'd be torn up in the audience, left for a lump of lard. But, then again, the guys playing the music are as old as I am, if not a little older. Do the lyrics and politics jive with my old pathetic self? No. But they sure brought back memories of days gone by, when I didn't have a mortgage, children, and could be pissed off while just wanting some ""skank."""
2,Kids don't get it,"I hate to post a negative review, especially since the author is someone I respect, but I just need to put this out there so other librarians like me won't make the same mistake--we just don't have the budget to afford books that won't circulate. I was excited to order this book--the premise is great and I figured teachers would love this in their classrooms--but it's so old-fashioned that kids today just don't get the jokes and haven't heard the sayings. Like sheep gambling on the lawn and the family coat-of-arms. It's targeted for young children but even the fourth-graders at my school didn't get most of the text. I think this book is amusing to adults, but is not for today's kids."
5,Wonderful,This was a favorite book as a child. Now I have purchased it for my child. We love to read it over and over. It is a great 5 minute read for bed. However we did spend an hour going over the concept of homophones and the funny things that adults say.
3,The King Who Rained,"This book is about a girl who will take what people say and tell the reader how she sees it. Like when her mom says she has a frog in her throat, so she thinks her mom has a real frog in her throat. This book is a realy easy reader for young children and a fun one that you can laugh at ."
3,They're how big?,"My review isn't of the product; it's of the description of the product provided by Amazon. According to them the ""Product Dimensions: 12.4 x 10 x 6 inches"" indicates a very strangely shaped mug. I suspect they're providing the dimensions of the box you receive the cups in. I'd really like to know the diameter of the top opening, the height of the mug, etc. It's the MUG I'm interested in, not the packaging. I'm giving it three stars only because I had to give it something and 1 or 5 didn't seem appropriate."
5,Booker T. an Unsung hero!,"This was an excellent book and well worth reading. It was very encouraging to see how a man who was a poor, black slave became a great man! However, even with his greatness he did not spend it all on himself but helped to educate and embolden his own people. It was also a great example of how christianity with mentors and discipline can accomplish much. We need more leaders like this today."
3,What is that apostrophe doing there?,"I probably shouldn't ""review"" this book, since I've only read a portion. But what in the world is that apostrophe doing between the ""Caught"" and the ""ya"" in the title? This is a grammar book, right? Either it's an awkward joke or the author, presumably a grammar expert, doesn't understand what an apostrophe does. In ""doesn't"" for example, the ""o"" in ""not"" has been removed, changing ""does not"" into ""doesn't."" What has been removed between the ""caught"" and that awful ""ya?"" I admit, the ""ya"" as an abbreviated (and painfully cute) ""you"" might merit an apostrophe after it-- but not before! Can't bring myself to buy it. I just have to judge this thing by its cover and just say, ""No."" 3 stars because there might be something worthwhile inside."
4,Fuentes examines distance and the inherent state of tension.,"Using short stories that subtlety arc together into a ""novel in nine stories,"" Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes suggests how various forms of distance create and maintain ongoing states of tension. Though the distance from Mexico to America is sometimes only razor wire thin, this sort of desolate distance simply adds to the undermining state that is the U.S. and Mexico's mutual distance apart. The bordering frontiers are therefore crystal. Literally questioning but syntactically suggesting otherwise, his examination fearfully asks ""will there be time for us to see each other and accept each other as we really are, gringos and Mexicans, destined to live together at the border of the river until the world gets tired, closes its eyes, and shoots itself, confusing death with sleep?"""
4,Un libro muy bueno.,If you want to understand the complex relationship between Americans and Mexicans this is an excellent read. You'll get more out of it than any dry textbook on Mexican identity and relations with the US. It's not his best work but it is very good.
2,Photocopy quality,"The book in itself is excellent, I have seen and used it for research at the Allen County Public Library in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I had hoped to include a copy in my own personal library, b ut when I received this copy, I found that a great majority of what I needed to review for research was illegible. Bottom line, ""I don't like it"" does not mean the substance of the book, but the quality of the photocopy results in the re-issue."
2,"""It's the Now that hurts!""","The title may be somewhat misleading, as this somber story is not about endangered species or a native tribe. Rather, it is the poignant portrait of a family--especially the relationship between two sisters--shattered by sudden, senseless devastation. Almost 11, Joss has longed to have her own horse--a dream about to come true on her birthday. But no one could foresee the disaster as family dynamics are irrevocably severed.Narrated by 13-year-old Kate, this book reveals sisterly intimacies and suppressed rivalries, while praising the role of devoted friends and kindly adults. Far from saccharine, this book will lead young readers into serious reflection on the fragility of human life; the ""personal myth"" of teenagers precludes acceptance that tragedy could occur in their own family, or to their close friends or even themselves. Each person must cope with grief in his or her own way, for death is always hardest for those who remain behind."
3,Super Reader,"In Revenant, Willow has a Chinese friend, which sets the scene for lotsof conflict with Chinese gangs, Chinese mythology, and allows for plenty of beatdowns by the Buffster.Gang types, as opposed to demon types, don't mind spraying the leadaround, though, which can be a it of a problem when you don't run around packing heat yourself as a high school girl."
1,What!,"When I met the band after a show one night I told them ""the music is what gets me nothing else but the music"". It seems like they were concentrating on something else other that the music that makes them OAR, especially when they made it sound like a Kelly Clarkston album and then sold it to the radio. Sorry, still love the band but this album just puts them on the bottom of my list of shows to see this year."
3,Not their best,"I don't know that the term ""popish"" thats been used in many of the reviews so far is correct in describing this album. Granted...its different...granted...it doesn't sound like all of their previous albums...granted, instrumentation has been processed...but popish, I don't know...OAR as clearly taken a step in a slightly different direction than their earlier works...is it good or bad? This fan personally thinks the album isn't steller...rather just another CD to be placed in the pile for occasional listening every once in a while...nothing I would throw out...nothing I'm ""disappointed in""...just something that doesn't really excite me..."
1,"How is this book ""in the public domain"" when it wasn't published originally until 1959?","This publisher claims to have reprinted this book as a public domain item copyrighted prior to 1923. That is impossible, as this book was first published in 1959. This edition, published by Nabu Press, is infringing on the copyright of the original publisher, as the book cannot by date be in the public domain."
4,Not just for kids under 10,"I bought this for my daughter, who is just a month old. However, I like the songs and enjoy listening to them myself (good thing, since I will be hearing a lot of this album in the coming years). All of the songs are good, with a nice beat - and yes, they're a bit silly - but I do have a few favorites. ""Moose With a Cowlick"" and ""I Can't Wait to Hibernate"" are my favorites. Songs by Brent Holmes really are ""for kids aged 1 to 101."""
3,Better off with a good textbook,"I am not a new pilot, but I'm always on the lookout for a new explanation of the fundamentals. Although this is probably a good read as a supplement for a student pilot, I didn't find it telling me anything new. I also found that the author at times went off on tangents with personal stories that didn't relate to the subject at hand. For my review of the fundamentals I think I'd be better off with a re-read of my Jeppesen textbook."
2,i didn't like this album.,it didn't resonate for me the way that david's last 3 albums do. this one is more poppy and commercial - i highly recommend SHINE instead.
5,A great way to get started on the guitar.....,This guitar book is very clear and to the point with bold and easy to understand illustrations. It provides the easiest way to play guitar chords and how to form chord progressions from them. It includes plenty to learn about playing the guitar for anyone making that first go at it.
2,Is this book really for First Timers?,I really had trouble following this book. I have never played Guitar before and I was utterly confused over what this guy was trying to teach me. If you have no experiance in playing the Guitar then i would suggest looking elsewhere.
4,grateful dead t,"Although this shirt is an extra large, it barely fits my tall, thin son. Had I ordered a XX large, it would have fit like a tent. Nonetheless, he likes the shirt, and will take care to wash in cold water and air dry to hopefully minimize shrinkage."
1,DID NOT RECEIVE IT..HOPE I'M NOT BEING CHARGED,NEVER RECEIVED IT!!! LISTED AS HAVING TWO LEFT THEN NOTIFIED THEY HAD NONE. STILL THINK IT IS LISTED AS HAVING TWO LEFT!!!!!
2,big arms = dont buy,"This arm band is pretty good quality. I put my 80G zune in it and it fits great. Now I'm not a bodybuilder by any means but my arms are 17"" and this band said it would go all the way up to 20"". It's extremely tight on my arm and starts to cut off circulation after a while. Maybe a wrist band but not an arm band. I think my 2 year old son can use this while he is in the sandbox. I think if your arms are smaller than 16"" it should work for you."
3,"Great product, with one small hitch","Got the product rather fast, which was great and it's a good quality armband and the zune fits right in there. Stays tight to the arm even during a rigorous workout."
4,I like it a LOT!,"I am a very hard rater. Even my FAVORITE movies don't get 5 stars. It has to be something amazing to get 5 stars. This movie is fun, has consistent laughs throughout the movie, and is very clean for the kids. I like that they've been able to keep the same actors throughout the franchise."
4,Funny movie - better than the first one,"In my opinion, this movie was better than the first one. My whole family enjoyed this movie - I hope they are working on another."
3,Good Movie for the Family,"As with the other Wimpy Kids, this movie was enjoyable and a nice movie to watch for the entire family on a Friday night"
4,Great Movie,This is another great follow up to the original Diary of a Wimpy Kid. This has great laughs and all the original characters are in it. I laughed just as hard at this one as I did the first two. If you're a Diary of a Wimpy Kid fan or have middle school kids then this is the move to get before summer starts.
5,movie,Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days is so funny just like their other movies. Great for the kids. Shipping was excellent! So grab the kids and make some popcorn and enjoy!
4,Easy to Install,"My wife bought this TV wall mount bracket for my daughter and it was easy to install. We were surprised with the dimensions of the bracket, but worked well to mount a 32"" TV."
1,It's not the thing I thought it is.,It doen't come with the songs everybody likes in the movie. Just some BGM and a few scores I didn't notice in the movie.
1,Comment,"A word of caution, esp. in light of Alberto's review: There is no consistent ""relativistic quantum wave mechanics""; there is only relativistic quantum field theory. Greiner's approach is archaic. Atomic physicists, who generally deal with only nonrelativistic electrons and nuclei, must use quantum field theory for the electromagnetic field. (See any modern book on quantum optics.) It is not just particle physicists who need field theory, and the fact that you can come away thinking otherwise is an unfortunate consequence of Greiner's old-fashioned approach."
5,Center Stage: Turn It Up,"Unlike most sequels, this was just as good as the first. All the stories are simiilar - boy meets girl from different backgrounds. There are a couple of cast memberes from Center Stage with lots of new talented members. If you like dance as the background, you will enjoy this dvd."
1,"This is a drag ""dream""--not Murphy and Stiefel bio pic","In ""Center Stage II,"" you are watching drag queens acting ballet. They move by way of alacrity. Remember, Ethan Stiefel is on the scene in .3. You actually see him dance in this movie. To date, this is the only document of Ethan Stiefel dancing. Everything else out there is a bootleg. He is only in 3 shots in ""Center Stage I."" All of the other ""scenes"" are a ""profiler."" Buy the movie to watch him dance. The rest, you are looking at a professional army.Ballet is art. It's dangerous.Here's the proof: [...]"
1,Broken in 3 weeks,"Amazing price and regretfully I have gotten what I paid for. Three weeks and it quit working, I took it apart and the soldering came off the connection. I have a phone charger that does not work. I had to give a 1 star rating because I can not process my review with no stars."
3,Interesting,"This book really makes you want to continue to read. It is also the right length. And LAuren Brooke ends the book well. However, this book is more focused on people then horses. And I prefer the ones about horses. But hey. In this book, Amy's Mother's friend, Huten, dies. Amy travels to Ten Beeches Ranch, his stable, with her boyfriend, Ty, to see how the family is coping. The family appears chipper, and this leaves Amy confused, because she was devastated when her mother died, but then she finds what is beneath the surface. Meanwhile, Amy's old friend, Carey, is thinking about leaving the ranch again. But leaving the ranch means leaving Maverick, a half mustang in desperate need of curing. If Carey leaves, the family will have to sell Maverick, for they have no need, or money, for horses who don't earn their keep. Carey is torn between what's right for maverick, her family, and her future."
1,Neither witty nor interesting,"I picked up this book because it seemed like it would be a funy, modern tale of being older and single in the city. So many of the other reviews spoke of it being really insightful, funny and sad. I found quite the opposite. The main character, Maria is hardly likeable. She bemoans her superficiality and does nothing to change it, pursues a relationship for most of the book that even SHE doesn't seem to be that into, and even her nervous breakdown and soul-searching find her looking for the easy way out (she wants a therapist/priest/anyone to do all the work for her). This book has a few funny one liners (about three), but other than that, it's surprisingly lacking in wit. In addition, the narration is a bit spastic, jumping from one place to the other without transitions. I kept reading, hoping for the book to get better, but its ending was just as flat as the rest. I definitely suggest checking it out from the library before buying."
4,seiko diver men's diver scuba titanium sports watch,This watch has become my everyday watch. It looks sporty and light because of its titanium bracelet and casing. It's great that this watch is automatic and the glass is hardlex crsytal which means its scratch proof. I love the design of this watch. The greatest thing about this watch is that is made from Japan and it cost half than an Omega seamaster. I am happy with the purchase.
1,Not compatible with wooden train components,This item is not compatible with other Thomas the Tank Engine wooden components. This information is not obvious from the website.
1,How to download your video,"I expected to get a CD, or at least be able to download the video to my computer, not a ""streaming"" video. I don't want to have to purchase a Kindle or other device to view the video, I want a CD to be able to play on my TV. I should have read your difficult to read instructions before I purchased the video. I want to download the video to my computer. How do I do this? The video is great; your service is less to be desired. I highly doubt if I will be purchasing from Amazon.com again."
2,Fast paced but vacuous,"I had heard good things about this author and tried this book, but was quite disappointed. The heroine seems like a flashback to the 1950s, complete with silly one-liners. I am about 3/4 of the way thorough it and don't know if I'll be able to finish it."
3,Works ok..but look out for glue!,"I'd like to start out that I used to make cues years ago, and I do have a lot of experience putting on tips, etc. I mainly got this device because my small lathe was down and I needed to do a couple of tips. The clamp does work as intended, as it will hold the tip in place on the ferrule. However you need to use extreme care to not get any excess glue on the ferrule in doing so. The problem is, that because of the design you can't actually see where the tip is attaching to the ferrule because it is up inside the barrel of this device. I would recommend taping off the ferrule before using this so when the excess glue is squeezed out you don't have to worry about it getting on the ferrule itself."
5,Good Results from Extra Efforts,"I had bought this same book used last Oct, and it arrived in a large mailing envelope. The CD included w/the book had never been opened, and I discovered it was badly cracked. It was likely damaged in the mail, while on its way to me. I tried to buy a CD replacement thru the phone #/website on the disc but was told it's only available w/the book, which is quite expensive new. At Amazon, I decided to buy another used version w/unopened CD included, but this time, I emailed the seller, Shari, and told her my concerns & to please use protective mailing w/this book. She respectfully did this, and the book arrived w/no damage. I appreciated her careful response. All books w/CD's should be carefully packaged.The book is a great reference and good to have available for technique reminders."
4,"Nice item, good price","I purchased this item as a gift. It was exactly what the recipient was looking for. There are lots of credit card slots and a place to hold a checkbook. As an added bonus, there's a coin pouch as well. It looks well made and seems like it would hold alot given its relatively compact profile. The price was also quite reasonable.I saw a few other reviews stating that this item was not like the one shown. That wasn't the case for me. I ordered the black one and it was exactly as pictured."
3,nice but,"replaced a similar buxton item with this one. very similar an all in all pretty good, but credit card spaces are very tight. forget anything more than 1 in a space. even at that, had too use a needle nose pliers to get 1 card out of a slot. maybe they will loosen with age."
3,Looks cheap,"Large size, fits a lot of credit cards and has extra side compartments. Nicely organized inside. But, the outside material is not good and it looks cheap."
5,Great gift; my wife loved it.,"This was a big score with my wife. It was exactly as it appeared and described. Good leather, stitching and other details. Quite a value for the money. She loved the size, the appearance, the quality and the many card slots available. The snap closure is a bit difficult for her to open due to her thumb weakness and pain. That is the only problem though. I like the absence of zippers. They seem to be the first thing to fail in this type of application. I highly recommend this wallet. (And I am a very tough critic as a consumer.)"
2,Loved it but damaged.,"I received this wallet as a gift from my cousin, it is so handy, really liked it, however, I received it damaged. a small section of the leather was torn. Well.. Sorry cousin, had to return it!!"
4,vest,fits very nice. nice vest for the price. just what i was lookin for . would recommend to other buyers
2,"Ok, but you get what you pay for","Fiance got this to go under his tux for our wedding in an attempt not to be nickled and dimed to death any further. Alas, we had to still buy another vest that fit him better throughout his triangular torso and have the seamstress take the buttons from this one and put it on another vest entirely because altering this one would have cost too much or more than the new one which was $60. Tacky metalic belt hinge on the back, not pictured, when pulled (but unable to secure) pleats up the back and wrinkles the look. You want a clean backed vestment, than this is not the vest for you. And the sizes run pretty large. Not as form fitting as it might seem in the picture.Otherwise, the tie is fine (so I have an overpriced tie instead), and it arrived quickly."
5,Professional,This was a very professional elegant combo set for the price. I have yet to find anything that can compare.
3,Good Book - Bad Shipping,"Have been trying to find this wonderful book for three years and finally purchased it, used, from Amazon. The book probably started its shipping route in good condition, but since it was packaged only in a flimsy envelope with no cardboard protection, it arrive smashed and bent almost in half. I am unable to open it and turn pages without creating more rips. Am I now stuck with this mess? Obviously, the shipper is at fault here. Please respond. Thank you."
5,This is the best naval war movie I've ever seen,The sub-titled version is better than the dubbed version END
5,"Great monitor, great price","I have had one of these for almost 2 years with absolutely no problems. The monitor looks great aesthetically as well as produces great color and images. It's been connected to two different computers, originally my wife's desktop with integrated video and then on a gaming machine with a higher end ATI card. The only downside is the VGA-only connection and no DVI, but that's the reason for the lower cost. I'm currently shopping for another monitor to create a dual-screen setup and am planning on buying another va702b to go with the first."
2,Dissapointed,"Bought this radio to replace my old small Sony boombox at work. I work in a factory,the welding department, so there is a lot of interference. What a dissapointment. Could only pull in the closest FM station, no others. At home in a wooden frame house in a small rural town the reception was quite good. Thats why I gave it 2 stars. My old radio never sounded or recieved so well after this."
5,GE Super radio,"A good value. We live in an area with poor radio reception and this radio gets gets many more stations then the others we have at home. It's reception is best when plugged into an outlet as opposed to using battery power, however it is effective under any power source. Not beautiful to look at, but it does the job well. I now own two of these radios."
4,GE SUPERADIO III,"If you're looking for a good all-around radio to take on camping trips or just have around for late-night boredom, this is it. A little heavy/bulky, but the sound that huge speaker puts out makes up for that. If you're a talk-radio buff or just an amateur BCBDX'r you'll be real happy with this. Tuning sensitivity is not great but is very good, and the range on the AM band is AWESOME. The FM sound is also very good! I haven't tried hooking up an external antenna to it yet (yup, its got a jack for one), but you can bring in stations from a long ways away with just the internal antenna. A dial light would be nice...that would be a big improvement. All around, for the price, its a helluva good radio"
4,"Careful, it melts!",I bought the original version of this radio back in the late 70s. We've had this one for over two years. It's a great basic radio with loud enough sound for shop/work use. We left it in the Vegas sun and it melted the case a little. It still works!
1,Superadio 3,I live in an area of poor radio reception . This radio is the worst of any I have tried over the years . Over priced junk !
2,Superradio?,"Nice AM reception. FM is surprisingly poor. The building I'm in makes it difficult, but my old el cheapo radio had better FM. So for me bottom line, great for AM, so so for FM."
5,Excellent value! A+++,"The GE Superadio rules the competition in its price range. I use my headphone jack with no problem. While the sound is not stereo it does not claim to be a stereo; the sound is very good quality even if mono. I like this product so much I am giving my mother one for Mother's Day. She lives in a remote rural area and down in a valley, so radio reception is weak. With this radio I am confident that she will be able to pick up a better variety of radio stations. If you want a high quality AM/FM radio that is easy to use... this is it."
3,I've heard it is good,"I've heard it is good, but I didn't get chance to use it, since I had some other rechargable batteries...nice looking though"
4,Gets the job done,"6 months later, not one issue. doesn't overheat, and the charge lasts. worth the very small cost."
4,Good buy at the time,"I've had my Nyko charge station for just under two years now. It's served me well all this time as I've never once bought batteries for my Wii-motes.I've decided to write this review to inform potential buyers to take care of the product during use. One of my rechargeable batteries that came with the package is no longer functional. This is as a result of the contacts at the back of the batery being eroded, as well as the contacts on the charger stand being slightly bent and/or pushed in.Other than that this was a great buy and at least I've still got one battery left that holds charge excellently ( I'm a casual gamer) as I've never had the batteries die while I'm playing even if I play a couple hours a day and forget to recharge the batteries between each use. I won't purchase another one though as I'll opt for regular rechargeable batteries that I can charge without putting a remote out of commission to do so."
3,Good for the price,"For 20 bucks you really can't beat it. I've been using it for almost two years now, and it's worked with one exception. About 6 months ago one of the charging prongs on the charger broke off so I couldn't use the left charger. The right one still works though. I would be careful when setting your remotes in the cradle, since putting them in too hard might cause the prongs to break."
4,Item needed adjustment,The charger worked for a few days then quit. I adjusted the contacts on the back (carefully) and it works again!
4,Great value!,"This dock works great! The batteries and the cover itself will fit your Wii controller perfectly. I would love that this dock had 4 charging stations instead of just 2, because battery life is not quite the best...but even with this minor ""defect"", you can enjoy at least a minimum of 6 hour continuous game play with no issue at all (I once lasted 8 hours playing Guitar Hero World Tour with my friends using 2 guitars, the mic and the drum set)."
4,Silly Little Strap,"The product works great. I'm sure you've read that annoying little strap sometimes gets in the way with the charging. I still haven't found the best solution to this.Also mentioned before the gamecube doesnt give it a ""full charge"" on the battery life but everything else is fine. Charges the remote perfect...haven't tested the length of the charge though. I do know it's atleast long enough for 2 hours of gameplay cause after that I have to stop and do something else.The battery cover grips are a nice touch. I like the feel of the wiimote better."
2,Was wonderful... for awhile,This product worked as advertised for about 3 weeks and then the batteries failed. Now the charger reports the batteries as fully charged after only 10 seconds of charging. Watch out for defective batteries.
2,Battery packs do not make a good contact consistently.,"I find the Wiimotes turning off at random due to a bad connection with the battery packs. The battery can read full charge, and after moving the remote a bit, it will spontaneously turn off. Good idea, poor implementation. I have the same problem on both battery packs."
1,Melted My Wiimote,On the intial charge the battery melted and nearly ruined my Wiimote if I hadn't checked on it and realized it felt a little too warm. Customer support offered to replace what they determined was a defective battery but declined to replace my Wiimote or give a refund. Great idea but it seems I am not the only one that is having problems with this product. If you have the money to risk it may work out for you but beware that it is a potential fire hazard and could at the very least ruin your Wiimote which cost $40 to replace. I wish I could give this thing a 0 or even negative stars. Buy at your own risk.
4,possible fix for bettery problem,"like many others, I had a problem with one controller working fine but the other wouldn't. The problem is that the battery isn't making contact with the wiimote. I fixed the problem on mine by folding a tiny piece of paper and wedging it on the top. hope this helps anybody"
5,Highest Quality Wii Charge Station,"This quality product is never going to be a regret for me. It adds the perfect ammount of weight to the Wii remote to make it feel less breakable. The charge lasts for a long time. This product is not only great because I do not have to change batteries, but it will also pay for itself because I do not need to buy new AAs. An extra feature I really enjoy is thee rubberized grip on the back of the remote. If you're tired of changing batteries in your Wii remote, buy this product."
4,Excellent reliable Wiimote charger,"For over 3 years now, this Wiimote charging station has worked like a charm!- Charging is as expected.- It's a nice sturdy station that sits well on a desk, table, or TV stand.- Great value at just $15. Saves you a lot of batteries and worry.After you're done playing, you just put your Wiimote with the Nyko battery and let it charge! Cheers to worry-free gaming!"
3,Incompatibility,"While our family has not had much time to test the durability and reliability of the battery packs, I quickly noted that the charger base/batteries are completely incompatible with Nintendo branded charger bases/batteries. The contacts are a completely different style on both parts and in completely different locations - be prepared to have two Wii remotes dedicated to using Nyko batteries with the Nyko charger; otherwise, you are constantly changing between Nyko and Nintendo batteries, etc. In the grand scheme of things, maybe not that big a deal...just a minor headache."
3,Gets the Job Done,"I've bought this product because i got tired of replace my batteries. The problem i've encountered was with shooters like House of the Dead or Ghost Squad to name a few. I use the Nyko Perfect shot and the problem is that the controller fits too tight in the compartment. What happens is that the trigger doesn't register the B button properly because its not settled properly. With all games though, there's no problems. The rechargle batteries last about 5 days for me. Maybe 3 for excessive use."
2,"it's ok, could be designed better","We got this for christmas, so I can't vouch for how well the batteries hold up, but it takes some fiddling with to get the remotes charging in the base as the wrist strap blocks it from contacting the charger correctly. The directions say to keep it charging at all times when not in use, and that's what we've done. No problems thus far."
3,Wiimotes Don't Hold Charge,"Rechargeable remotes don't hold a charge very well. At most, you can get 2 hours out of them."
1,Garbage...,"I must've gotten the only charge station with a faulty battery. I was pretty excited to get this, only to find that one of the battery packs wouldn't hold a charge at all. If it hadn't been for that I would've been behind this product 100%."
5,Great Charger,"I bought this about a month or two ago and the charger works really well. It charged in about 4 hours and was ready for use. You may have to adjust the handle string sometimes just to make sure that the charger and battery touch. Overall, this was a great buy. Very satisfied with product."
2,Good... for a while.,"It worked fine, until I noticed that I started sucking at Guitar Hero. I tried the other remote, and I did better, so I figured it must be the remote. After charging, I noticed that the bad remote was way hotter than the good one. I read reviews on here and saw that other people have had overheating problems, too.One remote is still fine, but I'm having doubts. I've had it for about 3 months. Rechargeable AA batteries might be a better choice; they're less expensive."
1,Not worth the $$,"Came broken direct in package -- one side had the connectors smashed, so it won't charge a remote on that side. I would recommend buying this someplace where you can physically see what you are buying instead of online."
1,buy a good AA battery charger instead,"GAVE ONE STAR, BECAUSE ZERO WASN'T AN OPTIONPiece of crap product. I bought two of Nyko's Wii Charge Stations under the impression that these battery packs could hold a charge for extended periods of time. I can not get a charge (on any of the four packs) to last more than ninety minutes. That is total crap.I contacted Nyko Industries about replacing the battery packs and they gave me an address to send them (at my own expense) to be replaced. The schmuck on the phone said it would take at least two weeks to receive the replacements.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM NYKO. THEIR PERIPHIALS ARE THIRD-RATE GARBAGE. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. IF YOU DO YOU ARE ONLY ASKING FOR TROUBLE. DON'T SAY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WARNED."
1,"Great Idea, Bad Implementation","When I first opened this and set it up, it was hard to keep the wii mote balanced in place, but that was okay. It seemed to charge fine, but now 6 months later, the system is completely broken. I don't know whats wrong but it doesn't work right. It automatically stops charging way too early and when I go to play with the supposedly charged batteries, they are drained in a matter of minutes. I eventually broke down and bought some real rechargable batteries from RadioShack."
2,Save your money,"There's nothing wrong with this, it works fine. But the WII remote can last a very, very long time of regular batteries. We would have been fine to just use regular battteries instead of the expense of this."
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY!!,"I bought this charger after, like most WII owners, i realized how many batteries we would go through. We got this over a year ago and it still works GREAT!! Recently we bought a charger that the wii sits in and charges 4 remotes at a time.....not worth the money!! The remotes only last an hour or so on that one....THIS ONE the remotes stay charged for days!! I am buying a second one so all the remotes can be charged together.....ready for play!Excellent quality!!BUY THIS, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!"
2,Killed my Wii Remote!,"I bought this about a year ago and it has suddenly killed my Wii Remote! I tried to sync it, but the lights will not turn on no matter what I do. I called Nintendo to complain, and they told me they received a lot of problems just like this with this specific charger! When I bought it, I knew it wasn't approved by Nintendo, but I never thought this would happen! Now I have to see if the store I bought the remote from will return it past warranty. Does anyone know if there is an approved charger? The Wii Charge Station by Nyko- great while it doesn't kill your remote."
2,No duro mucho,La idea era ahorrarme un dinero en el uso de los controles del WII. Pero resulta que las baterías recargables NO duraron mucho (se dañaron) y conseguir el repuesto genera un sobre costo. Termine comprando pilas AA recargables (que se consiguen en todos lados) y hasta ahora no he tenido que botar a la basura ninguna de esas pilas. Considero que con esta unidad he mal gastado un dinero ya que la base de carga quedo para botarla a la basura y los módulos de carga nada se puede hacer con ellos por que ya no quieren recibir recarga.
3,It saves on batteries.,"We wanted to cut back on the expense of batteries for our Wii. The only thing about this product is that the remotes do not fit well with the rubber casing. Therefore, you have to remove the case to charge. But they keep charges for a lengthy amount of time so you are not doing this all the time."
4,Worth every penny!,"Consider the environment and your sanity. This is a ""must have"" for your Wii. You'll save on batteries and you'll eliminate the many ""I need batteries"" requests from your kids. One downside - the rubberized grips for the Wii remotes will no longer fit once you install the rechargeable battery packs."
5,"More Fun, More time to play",Tanks for this product.This stuf add more fun to my wii moments and recharge the bateries fast.I like it.Thanks
3,Is mine the only one with problems?,"I love the idea of saving money on batteries, but since I have been using this thing my ""wii-motes"" dont always power off after the Wii powers off. They will stay on untill I remove the battery. Also; every now and then I have to re-sink the wii-motes with the Wii system. Theys annoying little glitches arent anything too bad, but they started with use of this charge station. Im surprised no one else mentioned anything about it."
1,Not pleased at all.,"I read other reviews on this product that were not favorable, however I decided to give it try. Shame on me. The charging station itself is a nice looking unit. That's all that's good about it. The tech support for this product is a waste of time as well.It will not charge the batteries that comes with the unit. The light turns green after just a few minutes. The remote has time to flash once before the charge is gone. I attempted everything the tech support said and even attempted only charging one remote at a time. Nothing seemed to work. They said they will send me two more battery packs. I doubt that will do a thing. Oh well. I suggest you save your money. Invest in a much better unit."
5,A Must Have for the WII,"This is one of the best investments/add-ons for the Wii. When you buy this you will no longer have to purchase batteries for your Wii remotes. The battery pack fits seamlessly on the back of the Wii remote. You won't even be able to tell it's there; if anything, it adds more grip to the remote."
3,A mixed bag,"Obviously the charge in these doesn't hold as long as batteries. That is true for any type of charging station, and I can't mark down for that.After owning this about 6 month, one of the docking stations simply stopped working. So I'm left with half of what I paid for. One side still works fine, so I still keep it out and use regulary (using that one side for both remotes), but it is definitely more of a hassle.After owning it for a year and a half I replaced it, since one of the batteries no longer held any charge, and the other one only a two-hour charge. Considering the amount of use I got out of it for the price, it wasn't a bad deal... but I think from now on I'm going to go for rechargeable AA batteries instead, since I can just replace those instead of tossing a whole unit when the charge no longer holds."
2,Works with caveats,"Pros:- Wiimote is always ready to play with a full charge- Design blends in to the Wiimote perfectly so you don't ""feel"" it.Cons:- You have to wiggle them when you put them back int the charger to make the contacts line up - minor inconvenience.- Based on where the charge contacts are, and the need to place in a cradle, you can not use the rubber jackets"
4,Really useful,"REALLY useful device, though it could have designed some way to charge the WiiMotes with the silicone sleeves on. That would be totally awesome!No more wasting money on AA bateries!"
3,So I am the only one...,So I am the only one having trouble with this thing? I can't even fit the battery packs into my Wiimote! Can anyone help?
5,Great Car Toy,"It's quiet, it's neat, it's a great car toy. Not too many pieces, they can erase it themsleves, my four-year-old loved it. It's a car toy that con't summer in the car. The insides melted and now it won't erase. Guess I'll be buying another one!"
3,Not what I expected from Wearever,"Skillet is serviceable, but too lightweight and not well balanced for heavy grates on gas range. I own older (approx. 10 yrs.) Wearever anodized cookware, which I love and this is not the same quality. Disappointed, but won't return as it was deeply discounted. Recommend Kitchen Essentials Calphalon."
2,"OK, but not nearly as good as the first 5 books.","This book was a bit of a disappointment. The first 5 focus on how a 20th century man fares in 13th Century poland. About 90% of this book focuses on how a 13th century Polish peasant fares in the new world created by the 20th century man. After loving the first 5, I found it difficult to care about this new character foisted upon us.Perhaps the part that bugged me the most was about the explorers contaminating the natives with disease. The series has established that Lord Conrad was an extremely well educated man who had even written manuals on sanitation. Any school kid knows the Europeans wiped out many people in the New World with diseases that hadn't existed there. Yet he seemed shocked and was ready to wall of Europe to prevent the same thing from happening to the Europeans. Hence the previously mentioned magical ending.Let's hope book 7 returns to the main character of Conrad"
1,Don't bother,"The beginning of the series starting with ""The Cross-Time Engineer"" is excellent, but this one has nothing new to offer. In fact it departs strongly from the theme of modern man succeeding based on superior knowledge and instead has him summoning up one deus-ex-machina after another. What's the point in a science fiction story where the hero has access to a magic wand?"
3,Hyphenation,"I have not finished this book, but so far it appears to be up to the standards of the rest of the series EXCEPT...the random hyphenation plague has truck with a vengence! Buy at your own risk."
3,Not Half Bad,"The strong point of the series, and this book as well, is that the author works interesting tidbits of history and science into the novel. The book is sort of like a ufological Tom Clancy novel in that respect.Read this book and you will learn about Nikola Tesla, volcanoes and Easter Island.On the other hand, this book is a lot harder to follow than the original novel which set off this series. I found myself skimming the endless action involving the aliens and lingering on the interesting passages. There are a number of well-written scenes with vivid imagery, such as the frozen mountain climbers on a ledge.I will probably read other books in this series, especially if I am at an airport looking for something to read on a flight. Just don't expect to find literature equal to that of Ray Bradbury or Asimov in this series. That is not its purpose."
5,back to blackhawk,"For those of you who miss the pure emotion that flowed from Blackhawk in their first albums, it's back. This is some of the best music that blackhawk has recorded since thier first two albums, and very well could be the best music they've ever made. Which is saying a lot. There are strains of music here that will remind some of Henry's days with the Outlaws, there are some great instrumentals, and, of course, Blackhawk's awesome harmonies, which have never been absent. Buy this album, you will definitely not regret it."
3,ehhhhhh okay.... tough to prove it though,"The delivery of the filter was fast.The quality of the filtration is... dubious at best.I use it but I have nothing to say it's any better than before. Now, if I knew a lab who could test the water before and after.Oh well."
2,missing pages,"I am reading the book and was unpleasantly surprised to find that around 50 pages are missing in the book. They have been replaced with part of another novel called The Wedding Day by Catherine Alliott. I don't see how this could have happened. But seeing that it was a used book, the sender must have realized it. Not real happy about this. Thank you."
3,Authors is very opinionated.,Author has a very strong opinion about what is wrong with the prision system. Tries to pound his bias opinion down the readers throat. Very educated opinion but it is just his opinion.
2,not for little kids,"You would think a Scooby-Do spinoff that has them as little kids would be appropriate for little kids. But Warner Bros. thought differently. They turned Freddie and Daphne into mean kids, added a recurring mean ""bully"" character, and made all the adults mean (in addition to being crooks, as usual).Somehow, with the original series, the writers managed to create a permanent money machine and enduring hit while making every character nice. Is that impossible today?This series is fine for adults who like cartoons but keep it away from your younger kids unless you want to teach them how to be bratty.For younger children, go with Kipper the Dog, the Wiggles, even Dragon Tales--but avoid this Pup series. It's a dog."
5,Great toy.,I got this for my great nephew for his birthday a few months ago and he still builds and rebuilds different motorcycles. He has 8 to choose from.
2,This Radio Doesn't Get Better with Age!!!,"I bought this radio in March based on the rave reviews it received. I use it for my cubicle at work, and for four months it worked great! Now it has suddenly turned into a static machine. The radio stations I used to receive with perfect reception are almost impossible to get without static. I haven't made any changes whatsoever; one day it just started to act up and hasn't stopped since. I am very disappointed with a radio that once worked so well."
5,A wonderful human tale on America's last frontier,"Running North is a page-turner!! Ann's spirited , fast moving, and intense chronicle of her family adventure is riveting. She captures the Cooks' human dreams, hopes, and fears, while skillfully weaving into the tale the engaging personalities of their canine colleagues. Running North is an excellent quick read that's hard to put down on the first pass. But the richness of her account makes the reader want to go back and savor the cold, the brilliant Arctic skies, and the determination of George, Minnie, and the rest of the team all over again at a more considered pace."
1,I NEVER GOT THIS ITEM,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM BECAUSE THE SELLER SAID IT WAS LOST IN THE MAIL AND THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY MORE IN STOCK.I SETTLED FOR A SIMILAR ITEM BUT I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION BECAUSE THIS ITEM IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY ORIGINAL CHOICE.THE SELLERS CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE WERE NOT AS HELPFUL AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
5,Dirty Poodle twists and turns like a rubber band snapping,Begins with tranquil instrumental rhythm. Floats into sparkly glittering dissonance. From there on out you're carried on a pathway of surfy funk love mixed with gentle winds blowing. I highly recommend it dude.
5,A Great Beginner's Guide,I had been struggling with how to start railroading for about 6 months when I ran across this book at the library. I finally have some direction and the available know-how to get going. The book covers the most basic subjects of how to get started as well as a few more advanced subjects. It's a must for new modelers!
4,4,"If you don't have any background in model railroading than this book is a good place to start. It will read great the first time through but don't expect to ever go back to it for reference later down the line. Concepts like control panels, wiring, switches, etc. are all left vaugely discussed, and for this reason it can be frustrating. Make sure you buy this is conjunction with another book better detailed in any areas you don't understand (like wiring)."
5,beautifully illustrated,As you would expect its a beautifully illustrated guide and informally written to boot. The only shortcoming for someone as raw as I am is the lack of detail in amounts used to create differing depths of colour and texture if landscape creation. Terms used eg 'latex paint' require some interpretation on this side of the Pacific but all in all I have been able to translate nearly all tools and materials. However a very basic term 'builders yellow glue' has me and a number of hardware stores in Australia a bit bemused. The book is an excellent investment and deserves your attention.
5,Better than TV!,"My kids play with their view master quietly by themselves when I insist that the TV is off. These are great toys, very durable (except for the reels which can bend) and good for the imagination."
3,ALERT: bogus reviewer,"PAID HACK: ""Roy Givens III""...is obviously an employee of Sirius, all of his 8 reviews are designed to run down XM radio and promote Sirius. What a pitiful, brainlessly-obvious fake. Surely Amazon can do a better job of screening out goons like this, otherwise the credibility of its users' reviews will continue to plummet.Me, I own nor use neither system, just wanted to post this as a heads-up for unsuspecting Amazon users, so I'm giving it 3 stars as a neutral rating."
4,The best extant history of analytical philosophy ?,"This is the first attempt I know of to tell a really comprehensive story about 20th-century analytical philosophy. Despite little or nothing on Frege, Tarski, and other important figures, Soames gives a coherent and convincing overview. Not everyone will delight in his assessment of Kripke's importance, and one might wish for wider coverage of the mid-century giants. Still, Soames is typically thorough and lucid in his analysis. So, while the conclusions are disputable, the value of the work is not."
5,Akataka,"Akataka's debut CD is a triumph!The rich and seamless arrangements are stunningly poetic and powerfully vivid. There is an extraordinary magic and delight as the lyrics become visible.You will relish in the poignant instrumentals,they are soothing and evocative ... freeing you from confining spaces.Akataka invites you on a joyous journey to walk the desert sand of all our yesterdays and feast upon the endless horizon of all our tomorrows.It is a gift.It simply is, what music is supposed to be!"
2,Look elsewhere for books on professional education,"Schon focuses his book on ""reflection in action"" and ""reflection on reflection in action"". While reading this book, he did make me self-aware of many teaching techniques that I currently use, but very little new ground was broken here. Not really worth reading, but may be of some value to new ""professionals"""
4,Can't please everyone.,I had to update my review on this to say that after a week of listening to this release I am hooked on it. It is fantastic!!!!No matter what a band does they are going to have mixed reviews. If Shinedown had recorded a new disc that sounded just like LAW you would have half the people saying how great it is and the other half saying that it is just a rehash of an old sound. I am glad that they are growing as a band and making something that is slightly different then LAW. It is a very good disc and well worth the price.
2,Disappointing,"A very different sound, they lost a lot of the 'balls' they had on Leave a Whisper. It's nice to want to develop a new sound and update your style, but this is a pretty big shift. I could have accepted the new direction if the SONGS were there, but they're just not, no matter how many times I listen to this CD. Hell, there's even a couple of guitar solos on here, I should love it! But I don't. You can't listen to Leave a Whisper and then listen to this and not know which one has the better tracks. The songs just aren't as strong on Us and Them.It's not a total failure cuz there is some decent material here, just nothing really inspiring or could be considered classic."
1,A Sophomore Slump..,"Well, alot of bands usually have an awesome debut album and then when we get there sophomore album, we learn if they are gonna stick around a bit longer or disappear.Well, I'm sorry to say that Shinedown belongs in the latter category. There debut album from 2003 ""Leave a Whisper,"" was awesome filled with fast hard infectious guitar riffs. Sadly, there 2nd album doesn't possess the same qualites it had. Every song on this album is just plain, seems poorly written, and just not produced well enough to what it could or should've been. I gave the album one star for the bands first single ""Save Me,"" and this song is not even that good. It is a bit catchy, but only about on the first 2 or 3 listens.All in all, if you are expecting the Shinedown of ""Leave a Whisper"" which such awesome songs such as Burning Bright, Fly From The Inside, and Left Out, your not gonna get them. Maybe on there third album, (if there still around) but not this one."
3,SMaller than expected,I expected the blade to be a bit larger. being that small make it less useful in a way
4,...only one thing!,"This knife is _almost_ everything I hoped for and expected, having owned _many_ Victorinox ""Swiss Army"" knives over the years.Functionally, it is just what I wanted: light and sturdy, overall very well built, and the blades have and hold a very sharp edge.My complaint is that the Victorinox logo looks to be spray painted beneath some sort of lightly lacquered finish - it gives the knife a ""cheap"" look."
5,Great instrument,"We are extremely happy with this piano. For starters, it looks gorgeous in our living room. Most of the digital pianos look spartan and boxy. This one looks like a beautiful piece of furniture. We have it sitting under a Matisse replica, and its legs look just like the furniture in the painting.The sound is extremely good - to the point you forget that it's sampled. The keys feel great and very realistic. Even the kids love to practice now, which is an ultimate compliment. I downloaded a bunch of MIDI recordings of all genres, free and completely legal. The player function can entertain for hours creating an excellent ambience.The cover mechanism appears to have been designed to avoid the possibility of sliding on its own. It takes lifting the keyboard side up in order to open or close it. Not a problem once we figured it out (although our keyboard is open most of the time since we use the piano quote often). Overall a great instrument and a fine piece of furniture."
1,"Huge, Heavy and Hard to Use","This book is so heavy in hardback, and the print is so small, that I dread getting it out when doing crossword puzzles. There are helpful websites that are much easier to use and read."
1,Not for the Kindle,"This may be a great crossword dictionary but it is unusable on the Kindle due to the lack of an effective indexing scheme. The index only consists of the first letter of clues (e.g. A, B, C, etc.) You then have to advance page by page, to find the clue you are looking for. With a million words, finding what you want takes a long time!Searching for the clue doesn't work either. For example, a search for the clue ""Mail"" returns 117 entries. Clues are undifferentiated from answers so you have to go to each entry to find if it is the clue or the answer.In addition to not having a usable index, it appears the publisher didn't make any effort to reformat this book for electronic use, which further compounds the problems.If you want a crossword dictionary for the Kindle, you're better off waiting until a better one is available."
5,Million Thanks!,I just received this book in the mail! It is fantastic. I was just finishing up my NY Times Sunday Puzzle and had about eight answers to go and I picked up this book and all the answers were in it!!! I usually have to look through about 4-5 books. It is an extremely thorough source. A million thanks to Stanley Newman and Daniel Stark for enabling me to tote one book around vs. a bagful!! A must-buy for any serious puzzler.
4,Best crossword puzzle resource I've found,"I bought this book for my father. He says it's the greatest book around for working crossword puzzles. The only problem he has with it is the print is very small and he has a difficult time reading it with his 67yr old eyes. He gets by with a magnifying glass, but said he'd like to have one with bigger print."
4,Gift for my mom,This is the only thing my mom really asked for at Christmas time and I almost forgot all about it! I ordered it and it was shipped very timely - luckily for me!
1,My Mom Loves It!,I bought this book for my Mom and she tells me she is amazed at the amount of information it contains. She says it has everything!
1,not usuable,"Takes forever to find the answer you are looking for and impossible to locate names of people with info on them. It's just too time consuming on the Kindle, so defeats the purpose of why you use a crossword dictionary. Wish I had checked into the book more before I purchased it or read the reviews, as I'll never use it."
5,love this movie,just as good as I remember when I was a kid. I bought this for my best friends daughters and they love it!
2,Wasted Potential,"Ultimate X4 or Ultimate X-men/Fantastic Four is just not worth the asking price of 12.99. Thankfully I got it for cheap because the story is poor, the villain wasn't all that great to begin with, and the art is quite bad. The only thing I liked about this was the 2 Encyclopedia issues of the Ultimate universe, they may be out of date, but it is nice to see how many characters were ""ultimized"". Buy this only is your collecting the Ultimate universe, and you want a complete collection. Otherwise, don;t bother."
2,No wonder it was so cheap,I am a fan of the 80s FF vs XM series. This novel sucks horribly compared to the 80s series.
2,Not for a strong chewer,My Pit Bull was able to bite off large pieces of the rubber bone within 10 minutes. This could be dangerous if swallowed. Planet dog advised me to return the bone for a 5 chomper one piece ball. It's nice to be able to exchange for something else!
5,Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Orbee Bone-Large,My German Shepherds loved it. One of the few dog toys that they can't destroy.
2,Expected Better,"This is deceptive in that I thought that this was a DVD set, when in fact, the package contains CDs. The 75 minute class is very advanced. I'm familiar with many of the poses, but was so confused in the first 3 minutes of the class I gave up. I had the flash cards spread in front of me and was trying to match the poses with what he was talking about and it did not synch. Plus he was talking so fast that I was standing when I supposed to be on the ground and vice versa. There is no warm-up. It's like you're standing there then he's like Down Dog, now Plank, now Warrior I, now Down Dog. It lacks flow. Also, there's no background music - just him talking. It's a preference, but I like music."
4,"Get it for the class, not the packaging","Like the OM Yoga in a Box, this one suffers from a bit of over-marketing. If you get it, get it for the CDs and don't get too excited for the stuff in your new ""kit."" It does come with helpful flashcards.I skipped the ""bootcamp""described in the booklet and just use it for the vinyasa class on CD.Be warned: it isn't really for beginners. You should be comfortable with the vinyasa flow of plank-chaturanga-up dog - down dog in order to do this class - he doesn't really ""teach"" that. He also doesn't give a whole lot of information on how to modify with props, so it works best for those who already know what they need.It is a vigorous workout, probably harder than the OM Yoga Intermediate by Cyndi Lee."
4,"Great Pump, not so great balloons",It's worth it just for the pump. The balloons are good for 2-3 uses before they become total duds
5,Be prepared for noise!,"I used to work in a toy store where we had these out to demo. Sometimes I would spend half my shift pumping up balloons and letting the kids chase them all over the store. So, I knew when my son hit a certain age that it was time to track down the Rocket Balloons. It's a big hit. I don't mind blowing them up several times while he chases them down. Great way to burn off energy. My child is under the age recommendation but he's well supervised and we enjoy this as a family game. I definitely recommend this brand over others because you get more balloons!"
4,The Difficulties and Rewards of Breeding.,"This book is very usefull to some one who is considering or has purchased a stallion. It shows that it does take good judgement and hard work. It's not all glamored up to make it seem like a breeze, and an impossible task."
4,Nice and funny book!,It gives a good idea on what to expect with a stallion. Also funny stories and good advice. The only negative is he doesn't take other breeds in consideration. Andalucian stallions are in general very well behaved for example. But still a good book that a would recommend to anybody dealing with stallions.
1,Perhaps I just got a bottle of water?,"We have very hard water and even using a whole house water filter and a water softener, we still end up with deposits in our toilets. I bought this CLR Bath and Kitchen cleaner because it says ""Quickly cuts through calcium, lime and hard water deposists, soap scum, dulling film and dirt"". It doesn't do anything. I sprayed into one of our toilets and it foamed. Then after letting it sit awhile, I brushed it, stains were still there. I have better luck using plain bleach. Perhaps the bottle that I bought just had water in it. I'm going to take it back to the store and get my money back. I have found that CLR products have always been way over-hyped and have never performed as advertised."
3,This thing was a waste of money.,"Its just a net and doesn't do much to keep dogs or kids from getting into the dirt, I should have known better than to purchase this."
2,Not a Quantity of 3!!!,"I bought this set for a flag football program, it says quantity of 3, but you only get 12 belts and 24 flags. The product description says this but saying it is a quantity of 3 I figured you get 3 entire sets, but you don't!!!"
5,The ultimate pratical reference to teach yourself mycology,"This is a well organized and written reference that makes sense of the arcane world of fungal names and nomenclature. I am a veterinary dermatology resident and from one careful reading of this book I was able identify the most common pathogenic and contaminant fungi. I recommend this book to the any health professional or student who needs to learn and more important understand and identify medically relevant fungal organisms. I wish all of my textbooks were this clear. If I had to choose one reference for mycology, this would be it. Bravo!!!"
4,WCW Superbrawl 8 review,"The Rick Martel-Booker T-TV title match was pretty good for a opener. The Perry Saturn-Booker T-TV Title match was rushed but still a solid bout. The La Parka-Disco Inferno match was not great but pretty entertaining. The Brad Armstong-Bill Goldberg was nothing then a mindlees filler. The Chris Jericho-Juventud Guerrera-Cruiserweight vs. mask match was a high-flying,entertaining showstealer. The Steve McMichael-British Bulldog match was slow but still a good match. The Chris Beniot-DDP-US Title match was a back-and-forth,high-tech,solid match. The Randy Savage-Lex Luger match was not great but pretty good. The Outsiders-Steiner Brothers-World Tag Team title match was short but sweet with a heel turn to boot. The Hollywood Hogan-Sting-World title match was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth,entertaining brawl. I give this PPV 8 out of 10."
4,Cold Sassy Tree Review,I needed this video for my grandson assignment. It wouldn't work on my machine but it did on my daughters. Great!!!
5,AWESOME SCRIPT!!,THE COLD SASSY TREE IS A REAL PICTORIAL VIEW OF THAT TIME AND HAS A GREAT SCRIPT THE WORDING IS FANTASTIC.
1,Read The Book!,"This is a wonderful novel. It is one of my favorites, so I was expecting great things from this video. I don't know why, because, with the exception of To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie never measures up to the novel. This one is even worse than usual. The characters are very poorly developed, the story has been changed somewhat--and not for the better. It has none of the warmth and humor of the book. I was disgusted with my choice and wish I had the money back!"
3,"Well, they burn.","The product does what it says, it is compressed wood squares used to start your fireplace. I didn't realize it takes about 3 to start the fire. There are similar products at my local store that would save the shipping. I did receive the order promptly so I would order from the company again."
5,Such A Fabulous Series,"I truly love the Franklyn/Broussard series. One reason is because Donaldson does not ""dumb down"" the technical aspect of the books in regard to Andy's work (coroner for New Orleans). The other reason is because, as a reader of this series from the beginning, I have seen the relationship between Andy and Kit grow and develop with each passing book. And also, I have gotten to know a little bit more about the characters with each book. I can hardly wait until he writes a new one. I highly recommend this series if interested in intelligent mysteries."
4,"Their best since ""Walking in London""","For a lack of a better word Group Therapy was boring,the offering didn't even sound like a Concrete Blonde production. Mojave sounds like a Concrete Blonde recording,very dreary, a atmospheric shady kind of ride. On the first song just listen to the Guitar work buzzing along a very bluesy smokey album. To me this is the comeback of the year."
5,Engrossing...,"I am interested in the topic of mystery, and witches and all, so naturally, I wanted to buy this book. I have been reading The Hardy Boys series since young, and have accumulated quite a lot of their books. This story was packed full of suspense and mysterious happenings. In fact, Frank and Joe get locked up in a witch coven in the end! I really recommend this book. It will keep you occupied, at the very least."
1,Waste of money,"After hand sanding and having to deal with dust clean up, I bought this to help with dust and sanding. The sanding screen sheet left grooves in the mudding even with the fine sheet. The plastic handle component that hooks up the hose broke after a few uses. Was very disappointed."
4,Sander,"This sander served it's intended purpose It provided pretty much dust free sanding. It is pretty much like me. It is slow, but it works well. I am pretty good at taping, so luckily there wasn't much sanding to do. One thing to note.... I hooked the supplied corrugated/ribbed hose up to the same type corrugated/ribbed hose on my shop vac, and the thing screamed like a banshee. I thought there waas a hole in the hose or something. I had to put a smooth section of Vac extension in between the two corrugated ones to get it to stop screaming."
4,can't wait to hear more,"Very good record. Even though this is much more polyrhythmic than the music of Silvio Rodriguez, you can tell he knows that music's lyrics well. I think the lean arrangements are what makes the music sound fresh. My only two complaints: 1) the strings are a distraction, obviously added onto already-existing arrangements that can stand on their own, and 2) the two duets are lousy...they seem forced and awkward."
5,Love It!,"We received this pitcher as a wedding gift back in 2007 and it's perfect. It's absolutely beautiful and I'd love to have another. I put it in the dishwasher, refrigerator, have ice in it, etc.You do have to watch when you pour that you clean the lip of the pitcher or it will drip down a little....but I don't even mind it because I love the looks and function of it so much!"
3,Manga,"Ignore the reviewer below. Her life is too focused on yaoi and bishounen that she's lost all touch with reality and is very sexist against women. Her review is very misleading because not everyone who is interested in manga are yaoi fans (though I am one myself).I am not really fond of horror manga, but the cover grabbed my attention. The artwork on the inside is rather mediocre despite the nice cover. The story was hard for me to follow at times, though I can be rather slow at things anyways.If you're a fan of horror or supernatural stories, I'd say give it a shot."
1,Hardly worth it.,"The author of this Graphic Novel is famous for her work on Yaoi and Shonen Ai/BL Manga. DO NOT BUY THIS MANGA ON THIS FACT!IT IS NOT YAOI OR SHONEN AI/BL. IT IS HENTAI!There is ALOT of female nudity in this Manga, that is NOT censored, meanwhile alot of male nudity is censored. There are a few sex scenes. None male-to-male. All female-to-male.It has no Yaoi elements at all except the one quote at the end of the book where the main character says ""It would be worse loving another man.""There is some blood and gore. But not enough to forgive for the lies I was told about this book that were saying.Listen to someone who bought this book looking for slash at least and was bombaded with Hentai instead."
2,Not comprehensive coverage of exam material,"I have been using the exam cram series in preparing for all of my MCSE test. Until now I have been completely satisfied. The IIS 4.0 book is missing several components that are covered on the test. One such topic is sub-netting of TCP/IP addresses. This was not covered in the book, and was on the test. Personally I think this should have been left to the TCP/IP test, but if it is going to be on the IIS test it should be in the book."
1,What happened here?,"I took the exam after reading this book and failed it. I passed my first 5 MCSE exams first time every time with 800+ out of 1000, including Exchange 5.5. This book just doesn't cover what is required to pass the exam.I was quite surprised at how bad it was as all of the other Exam Prep / Exam Cram books I've used to date have been great.Keep away from it."
3,Electric Sandwich - self-titled (Repertoire),"German blues rock band's sole release. I've seen this CD available online for awhile now, finally got to hear it. This disc is often tagged as krautrock - but only the eight-minute opening cut ""China"" is kraut-like but the rest of the CD is pretty much blues rock, in the same vein as Ten Years After, Thin Lizzy and certain Zeppelin tunes. Better tracks off this 1972 obscurity are ""It's No Use To Run"", ""Archie's Blues"", ""Material Darkness"" and the added bonus cut, a three-minute single version of the previously mentioned ""China"". Line-up: Jorg Ohlert-guitar, organ & keyboards, Klaus Lormann-bass, Jochen Carthaus-harmonica & sax and Wolf Fabian-drums. Nothing outstanding, but okay."
4,An entertaining sequel.,"The Cop (Robert D`Zar) was left for dead and missing from the river is back for more. This time, he has find the people has wrong him and having his revenge people has thought has killed him.This horror/thriller is well made & better acted than the first film. Directed by William Lustig (Maniac, Relentless, Vigiilante) and Written by Larry Cohen (Guilty as Sin, Phone Booth, Q:The Winged Serpent) from the Original flick. Grade:B+."
1,Deadly dull and silly stuff.,"Zombie cop is on the loose again. Yes, this sequel's ""bigger"" but man it's boring and silly. Some action, but hardly enough."
1,Stay clear of this one,"After going through the time and trouble of installing the Cruisader on my Cycle, and then to find out this thing doesn't work. Tells me that there is a ""Com Error"". Not a happy camper! Now I have to take it all off so I can return it. Did I mention, Not a happy camper!"
1,Goodness,"I read the reviews and thought no way could a book leave you more clueless than when you started. This one did it. I read the first chapter and was lost beyond words. I was struggling in class and thought the book would clear up some things. Nope. I couldn't it even compare it to the lecture and put some pieces together. It did one good thing: made me realize I'm not cut out for computer science. If I couldn't get it with the book and class lecture, then there was no hope for me down the line."
3,Not enough examples,"I had to get this book for a Introduction to Computer Organization class, and have found completing assignments with this only is near impossible. This book needs more examples, and problems worked out -- for example in Chapter one you learn about base X [X being any number] number system, well the book only gives you examples for basic numbering systems (Binary, Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal) and never shows any examples for other number systems. This is not helpful when you have to multiply base 11 numbers... This book is well written and easy to follow, and if it had better examples (and more examples) I would probably give it five stars, but the lack of examples made it not very helpful for assignments, and it way too expensive!"
1,Hard to read,The book is poorly structured and confusingly written. Also it contains a lot of errors in given examples. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Needs more examples!,"The other reviews said it all. This book is detailed and thorough, but is practically impossible to learn from because there are not enough examples, and there are no answers to the problems! You can get selected solutions on the website, but even with the answers, it can often be very difficult to figure out how to do the problems.I'm on Amazon.com right now because I'm desperately seeking other books that will help me pass my Logic Design class..."
1,Lacks everything a book of this kind can,This book fell seriosuly short of the depth of the course that I took.
2,sent international version,"Never specified that it was international version, couldn't send it back because my class already started. It was a huge inconvenience."
3,Superstar and Superlight book,"An interested book where is always asking the constant definition of the destiny; however during the development of the book we find a literary deficiency of many kind and also evidents counterpoints.If you have any other information of Paulo Coelho's work, could you please send me what do you have? and what do you think about my review?"
2,Aburrido,"Tampoco entiendo el éxito de este libro. Me pareció pedante y presumido. Concuerdo con que tiene poco valor literario, como han dicho otros aquí."
5,"bellísimo, inspirador","Un libro que nos inspira a ir tras nuestros sueños sabiendo que podemos alcanzarlos y a luchar por las cosas que queremos, disfrutando cada aprendizaje de la jornada. Nos enseña que, como el mismo dice textualmente en su libro ... Solo una cosa torna un sueño imposible... el miedo a fracasar. Nos empuja a confiar y perseguir nuestros deseos más reales y que al final del camino encontraremos el tesoro que todos llevamos dentro. Lo recomiendo a todas aquellas personas que a pesar de la edad que tengan, todavia son capaces de soñar..."
5,El Alquimista,"The book came in excellent condition, for the price agreed, from USA to England, in much less time that I had been advised."
2,No todo lo que brilla es ORO,"Realmente compre este libro Basado en los reviews o comentarios de los demas,El ""ARQUIMISTA"" se base de o el autor se enfoca en tres Pasos:1- Un Pastor2- Un Oasis3- Un Arquimistahay libros que te dan deseos de seguir al proximo capitulo, este te da deseo de terminar rapido para salir de el capitulo que estas y ver si encuentra algo interesante en el proximo.He leido 2 Libros de Paulo Coelho incluyendo este y tratare de evadirlos."
1,Decepcionada,"Me comence a leer este libro con mucho entusiasmo ya que me lo habian recomendado como uno de los mejores libros que esa persona habia leido. Soy una persona que lee muchos libros y de varios generos, y este libro me dejo muy decepcionada. Me parecio un libro aburrido, y desde la primera pagina del libro sabes como la historia va a terminar, lo que hace que leer este libro sea aburrido."
4,Muy descriptivo,"Me gusta la forma como uno se informa sobre costumbres de otros países a través de este libro, utiliza un lenguaje excepcional, muy bueno."
4,Motivante,"Este es el primer libro de Paulo Coelho que leo y la verdad me dejo un buen sabor de boca. El libro narra la historia de Santiago un pastro español en busca de su ""leyenda personal"".Realmente este es un libro muy motivante, el cual desde que comencé no lo pude dejar hasta que lo terminé, un libro muy recomendable."
2,YYaaaaaawwwwnnnnn,"I had high hopes for this, reading the reviews. With the line-up and being a monster IQ fan I was sure I could not go wrong.Wrong I went. This is simply very boring. I have been through it a solid 4 times and find little to smile about. Very average singing (low on melodies), weak lyrics, and just downright cheesey. It sounds like an 80's band that is trying to revive prog music and confused as how to progress.I did pick up more than meets the eye and was far more impressed with the writing on that one."
2,Too delicate for frequent use :(,"Earmuffs have a nice feel and appearance, so that's a plus. They were a gift to an adult, so they weren't abused by someone who didn't know how to handle them, but nevertheless the connecting band broke within 2 weeks of first use. They were given early in December, and were in the trash by Christmas."
1,Don't do the trick,"Maybe I have lopsided ears or something, but these things just let the wind get right in. I live somewhere cold where I need good ear protection when I walk to work in the morning, and these things just don't cut it. Additionally, they're the roll-up-for-easy storage sort and, therefore, sit on the head quite awkwardly. If you need good quality ear-muffs to use for more than just cute fashion, I'd look elsewhere."
5,a very dynamic earth,"Skinner, Porter and Park give you a richly illustrated introduction to geology. The text spans the breadth of modern geology, and shows an exciting and changing planet. There are numerous photos of examples of terrain, often accompanied by schematics to aid understanding. The latest techniques practised in geology are explained. Especially noteworthy is the extensive use of GPS. This has greatly aided recording the location of interesting geological samples.Earthquakes are also well covered, and will probably be of interest to many readers, especially if you are in California. The history of the Richter and Mercalli scales is gone into. Unfortunately, predicting quakes is still very uncertain!The discussion on earthquakes is also used as a good example of plate tectonics, where the latter is probably the central idea of geology."
2,Rushed and a disappointment,"Usually, Peter David's books in the New Frontier series are funny, entertaining and a pleasure to read. However, this storyline seems rushed. In previous books, Janos is introduced as a Mugato. Now, we are expected to forget anything we have read about Janos as a new background is written about him that seems, even in the Star Trek realm, hard to digest. I won't give away the details, but, this book is a disappointment, unusual considering the breadth of David's writing."
5,The Best Book Ever,"This book is quite possibly the best book i've ever read. I must go out and buy more of Torey Hayden's books, I am hooked. I was clinging to every page, staying awake all night to see what happened next. Her devotion and patience with these kids is astounding. The way she cared about Kevin amazed me. The way she practicly sacraficed her life for this child, just to see him come through to the other side. It brings me hope for the troubled children in my life. I know now that i can make a difference."
4,Good for Beginner to Intermediate System Admins,"I consider myself a developer rather than system admin. But I enjoyed and learned quite a bit. I read this book in one 7 hours bus journey. It is very good on introducing new topics. It teaches you how to use programs and give recommandations.I think my money is well spent.Think it, this way. When you start to learn something new, you are bombarded with a lot of buzzwords and jargon. This book will teach you most of this buzzwords and you will learn quite a lot in reading this book. A internet search about tools will bring you more similar tools and new learning points.As I said in the title, this books is about beginners. If you are a expert, I do not think you will gain a lot from this book."
3,Book missing CD,"This book is now classified by the publisher as ""out of print"" and this is a reprint. I just got off the phone with Prentice Hall, and the CD-ROM does NOT come with the book, regardless what the Amazon listing says.My lowered rating does not reflect the quality or content of the book, rather a gaping omission on the part of the publisher. The CD is integral to the material in the book.Luckily - it is rather easy to download most of the tools that the book references."
4,Master of Prose Does it Again,"I've read every book Harrison has written and this is another great one. You can always count on Jim Harrison for brilliant descriptions of nature, amazing internal dialogue, and the most perfectly integrated sex scenes I've read. The rhythm of Harrison's writing is fascinating, he has mastered the art of alternating introspective philosophical ruminations with straightforward action narrative in a style that can only be described as Harrisonian. He uses his favorite words only a few times in this one (""otiose"" and ""delaminated""). Harrison delivers something no other writer does. The ending is an amazing few pages. Highly recommended."
3,Not a bad knife,"Pros:The knife is extremely sharp, almost like a razorfeels very durableI love the classic look of it also, even has an area on one side that you could engrave a name or initials on.Easy to concealCons:Tough to openTough to openTough to openWhile holding it, the ""handle"" has sharp metal edges where the knife slides in. Its rubbed an outer layer of skin of after opening a dozen boxes.If this knife was easier to open I would use it a lot more."
4,Add this to your library!,"Falconry is a sport with a long, complex history and tradition, and there is a wealth of falconry-related literature out there. This book is good to have on hand when researching a word or phrase related to managing your own hawks. Having all these definitions at your fingertips really helps (a lot of falconry classics contain archaic language or very specific terminology). But, the Encyclopedia also contains a lot of current information. It is not a how-to book, so it does not replace any of the better falconry manuals. It is, though, a solid reference tool you will consult time and again."
4,love the bag,"i love this bagit looks ridiculous when used as a backpack but feels goodi overloaded my bag with several big text books and my laptop and jumped off of a 3-4 ft ledge and it broke the snap that holds it together as a backpack :(dont be stupid like mei now can only use it as a messenger bagthe compartments on the front are greatits like they were designed just for what i would useone perfectly fits my portble harddrive, one for my camera and one for my wireless mouse. the three compartments are PERFECT for thisbag is very well padded and protects my laptop very wellgood buy! and good bye!"
5,I love the Gilbert's Law Summary's,"The Gilbert's gives you the most important information from the casebook in a fantastic format that is easy to use.A solid case brief book will really tie things up nicely. With a case brief book - also research the case on the Internet or Lexis to get some background information that the case brief book will not give you - to get the big picture of the case.The Gilbert's gives you the black letter law you need, I highly recommend Gilbert's!"
5,"This CD is amazing and fun, not just for jazz lovers","Each musician here is creative and a great instrumentalist, most especially Dan Coy. The very amazing thing about the CD after listening to it is that it was recorded live with no studio improvements in a restaurant/bar in Atlanta, GA. The trio is super, the choice of songs is great."
2,mountains of much,"All the hype that I had read and heard about it,just didn't measure up. I was disappointed at how repetitive it was, the long drawn out descriptions that added up to nothing,the first person narrative that was devoid of any sort of suspence with no dialogue throughout. It was comparable to something that was written by a high-school student without a Thesaurus. This is the longest it's ever taken me to read a couple hundred pages....."
5,Nice game,Pretty expensive so will point out a couple of issues we had with this game out of the box. Had to remove the pond from the letter fishing station as it is virtually impossible to get the magnets on the letters to stick to the fishing pole and pull them through the opening of the pond. So we set aside the pond and laid out the letters on the board. Other criticism is that the plastic snack hut which is supposed to click into the game board does not stay attached. That said my 5 yr old loved the game and I would probably buy it again and would recommend it to others.
3,Passable model.,"It's an alright High-Grade kit. It's a far stretch from amazing. Only minor details. The arms don't like to hold up the weaponry, so it's hard to pose. It's a shame this is the best Heavy Arms Custom available; I'd love to see something at Master Grade quality."
5,Only difference is the price,"I purchased this product almost a year ago when I purchased my Sony digital camera. At the time, the Sony Memory Stick was...more than the Lexar. I figured that I would give the Lexar a try for that big of a difference in price. I have never been happier. I have two Sony memory sticks(8 mb) and the Lexar(8 mb). I have never even noticed a difference in performance. For anybody who is hesitant about purchasing this product, it is definately worth the price!!! It is not worth the upcharge that Sony puts on theirs just simply because of the name that is on it."
3,Beware: Not compatible with Dazzle Memory Stick Readers,"This stick worked fine in my digital camera (Sony DSC-P71), but was incompatible with my memory-stick reader (Dazzle USB).As far as I know, Lexar is trying to work a solution, but hasn't come up with one yet."
4,Post-apocalyptic action,"This movie is an all around good time. The action is fantastic and Mel Gibson is great as usual (despite almost no dialogue). The photography is beautiful as well, although not as good as 'Mad Max' in my opinion. The story is probably the weak point in this movie (compared to the original's powerful revenge story), but you don't always need a story when the action's good. Although there is an interesting twist towards the end that you may not see coming.If you are a fan of the genre, this is one of the better ones and worth seeing (more than once), but check out 'Mad Max' first if you haven't already. I recommend the entire trilogy."
4,Impressive transfer,"I have always been a fan of this and the original Mad Max movies. I was pleasently suprised with the quality of the transfer to Blu-ray fo rsuch an old movie. It had it's poor quality moments, but they were far out-weighed by the quality cheesey-ness of the films story. Loved it!"
4,"Almost the way it should be, butnot quite.","Despite what one reviewer said, the widescreen version on this disc is true widescreen. I am guessing that the reviewer did not watch beyond the first five menutes, which is in reduced full-screen mode as it was originally shot for the cinema.One the down side, this is not the full-length European version which is around a minute longer and has a more graphic boomerang scene, rape/murder scene, and chase scene at the end.It's worth the $10 I paid for it, even though it is the original US release version."
3,"Good for action and Mel Gibson fans,","I didn't particularly like the original Mad Max, even though I like Mel, mostly because it was kinda boring. This one at least held the attention all the way through the movie. Not much story and kind of shallow in every other way. This one will appeal only to Mel Gibson fans and action lovers."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!! SERVICE!!!!!,WOW!! I got my products in mint condition and super super fast service. I highly recommend this buyer. Very PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT QUALITY... Will order from them again.....
4,This film is a great no-brainer!,"If you want a movie with no thinking involved, get the Road Warrior! It is a great movie! It is totally self-suffecient, and dosen't require seeing Mad Max. It is a great film!"
4,Looks FANTASTIC in HD! Better than in the theater!,"""The Road Warrior"" is one of my all-time favorite action movies, and I've always been on the lookout for a decent home video presentation after I saw it on its original theatrical release.I've had the VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD versions, all of which were OK, but never until now have I been truly impressed.Almost the entire film looks absolutely perfect, with the exception of a few night scenes that exhibit grain, but I think that was on the original film.Although this was originally recorded in mono sound (I think), the 5.1 mix is nicely done and sounds natural, although it's not overpowering.And all you whippersnappers who haven't seen this, see how REAL car stunts are done. It's so much more impressive when you know it's not CGI : )Definitely recommend."
3,I'm sure it was a great movie in 1982...,"There no question this movie was a good one during the '80's period, but sadly its not during are present time of 2006. As I was watching it, it seem to be to simplely made as a movie, and I guess at this time CG graphics were not widely used. That can be a good thing and bad thing. Some of the stunts in the movie were ok. I'm sure if they remade this movie again, it would be a well rounded movie. If you like these kinds of movie, go ahead and add this one to your collection, if not, I suggest renting this one..."
3,Cute little book,"I found it fun, so did my wife, but I will warn you... some small arguments happened too. With certain people I could see huge fights happening.Still, I say it is better to know eachother than live as strangers."
3,hmm,"I liked the concept of the book, obviously that's why I bought it. But, by the time I got to the middle(I've bought this twic for two different relationships), my relationship was broken off. It was just time consuming..."
3,hmmm,"well be prepared for the questions inside, the product is in perfect shape like the picture excellent condition but not very useful caused many problems for me"
4,Sweet idea for couples.,"I really liked this book. You get to fill it out with your significant other, you'll get to know a lot about who you're with. It is FULL of questions, some are fill in the blank, multiple choice, or check all that aplply. Its a good time reading it with someone you love."
2,Ho hum,"Honestly not as interesting as I was hoping for. Also, it pries a little bit too much into ""life before"" - there are really somethings about my fiance that I just don't need to know! It's still fun to go through the book and answer the questions but I don't know if I'd recommend it or buy it again if I had it to do over. The more I read through it, it seems like something you fill out and then never look at again and it's not something you'd ever want your children reading."
3,so cute,Just like the one my dad had when I was young but 1/3 the size... Not very durable or even usable things. More of a novelty item I feel.
2,Certainly no Chandler joint.,"I tried really hard to like Hammett's books but they just fall flat on their face compared to PI novels written bij Mr. Chandler. There is virtually 0 suspense and the main character is certainly not the contemplative type. Raymond Chandler's books hold so much more character, whether its the simple yet clear description of a house PI Marlowe is driving up to. Or a character description, so much more ambiance is to be found in the world of Chandler."
4,Comprehensive and highly readable,An excellent pen portrait of life in the Philippines in the Victorian era by a very observant writer. Would put many modern histories to shame in its coverage based purely on the author's own observations. Fascinating.
1,totally unbelievable,"Maybe, just maybe this could have been salvaged. While our heroine had aspirations to become a doctor is somewhat plausible I couldn't read most pages without wincing. It's the little things like a Viscount's daughter addressed as ""Lady"". Being a regency/victorian fan I thought all the informalities a bit tedious and not true to the period. More research on the author's part would have been appreciated. But I'll never find out as this is the first and last of this author I will ever read!"
3,ok product but parts express stinks.,"I ordered these speaker spikes, to make a long story short, one spike was defective. Called up parts express, told them about problem, they said they would send me another spike. That was two weeks ago, still no part, and probably wont be any either."
2,Wireless sensor bar for on-the-wall TV,"I was so excited to find a wireless sensor bar. We have a TV that hangs on the wall and the wire was distracting. My problem is that the sensor bar does not stick to the underside of the TV. To stick it to the top of the TV takes away much of the ease using the remote. i.e. the ""hand"" you need to make selections is difficult to bring up. When I used double sided tape to stick it on the bottom of the TV the sensor worked much better but it fell off quickly. BUMMER!"
4,Works Well - Battery Life Could be better,"Use with my home theater. Works well. Other Wii users say it bests than their orginal equip.Even using 2400mAh+ rechargable AA batteries, I'm changing them aprox. 1x/week (about 10 hrs. of play). Not terrible. Just hoped the 1hr auto-shut off timer, IR-LEDs (low power) and four batteries would equal longer battery life.It beeps for 2 min to alert players that unit will be shutting down. However, if no-one is playing it can be heard several rooms away. Quick fix. Put clear tape on the speaker hole to muffle the noise."
4,Better Sensor,This bar performs better than the original that came with the Wii.I needed to but a piece of masking tape over the blue status LED because it was too bright.
1,A piece of crap!,"Ok, when buying this wireless sensor bar, I thought it would turn out to be a great deal. Not only was it cheaper than a ""wired"" sensor bar, but also it provides the freedom to move it around without tangling cords. Well, I was wrong. This item is a piece of junk! It worked ok for the first week or so, but then it just crapped out. The so called ""sensor"" didn't pick up anything from the Wii remote (and yes, I was closer than the allotted 25"" away). The battery compartment is too tight to house 4 AA batteries, that when I attempted to change them out, something inside snapped and now the batteries move around, not registering a connection. Avoid purchasing this product at all costs. Fork out the extra $5 bucks and get a wired sensor bar, you'll have a lot less of a headache to deal with, let alone throwing $[...] bucks away..."
1,This would be a zero star if I could,"This sensor bar is HORRIBLE. It's the worse most frustrating piece of technology I've ever owned. To start it uses 4 prehistoric double A batteries and it consumes the 4 batteries at a ridiculously alarming rate. Another con is this sensor bar doesn't actually turn off even though there's a power button, it's rhetoric and very very inconvenient having to remove all 4 batteries from the sensor to turn it off. Yes, all 4... This junk somehow SOME WAY manages to kill itself even if the incorrect amount of batteries is in place. It doesn't work from far away (yes, I've played with the sensor settings) the hand mouse on the screen shakes making it hard to confirm tasks. It's overpriced. There is absolutely, positively no Pros to owning this monumental overpriced piece of crap. Do yourself a favor, save $20.00 buying a wired sensor that's dependable which will also save you HUNDREDS of dollars in batteries and frustration. Don't risk it or else I told you so."
2,Not recommended,"Bought this wireless sensor as a replacement to our original. Would not have purchased if I had know how fast it eats batteries! Yes, the range is somewhat further than that of the original, but the batteries (name brand batteries!!!) only last for about 3-4 playing hours! With 3 kids in the house and using the Wi-Fit myself this get's very costly and not at all worth the extra range!!!"
2,wireless sensor bar kills batteries,The bad part about this product is it kills batteries super fast you will go through 2 AAA every hour with this product I suggest not getting it
2,Could be better.,"I bought this at Best Buy and returned it the next day. I wanted a wireless bar because I sometimes will bring this to non-Wii friends' houses. The reason I returned it is because I wanted to use the already attached stand on my LCD TV but when I used the included adapter, the unit fell off within 5 minutes. I think I could of used it on the bottom but I am stubborn. There is another wireless unit on the market and according to the review posted previously about if you need a wireless, I might try it out. Good luck, and I hope you found this useful."
2,Bad,"This is a horrible product. I really wanted to put my Wii far from the TV, thus neccessitating a wireless sensor bar.The quality of the sensor bar is nowhere near as good as the original Wii one, frequently losing signal. It's not awful or unplayable or anything, but it's just clearly and significantly not as good as the original.It also eats batteries for breakfast. I'd estimate the batteries last no more than 20 hours, because if I ever forget and leave it on overnight, the batteries are dead when I wake up. That means the battery drains almost faster than the wiimotes, which drain fast themselves!"
3,Battery Powered,"I bought the sensor bar thinking that it would help. The problem is that to leave it on permanently drains the battery in about two days. Also, it has this timer thing on it that beeps but does not turn it off--it just keeps beeping until you turn the thing off. Other than that it is a great product. Much better than the one that comes with the Wii. I just wish it didn't chew through batteries so quickly."
1,Fails permanently after only 10 hours,"This wireless thing would be great, if it hadn't stopped working. It worked for several play sessions just fine. Then one day it stopped working. It APPEARS to be working (the blue light comes on), but the controllers simply don't point to the screen. I changed batteries twice with no change. We've moved it on top, adjusted the angle every which way, etc. We didn't drop it or anything (and, as I said, the blue light still comes on).My hunch is the thing is poorly constructed, so it'll be hit or miss as to whether any particular unit will last a long time or fail soon (or something in between).Keep your fingers crossed if you choose to buy it."
2,"Battery Drain, Unreliable","The wireless sensor bar works really well with a new set of batteries, but it drains them in a matter of days and as it drains the signal gets weaker and weaker, so you have to sit closer and closer to it, and your wiimote cursor will go in and out. So unless you NEED a wireless sensor bar, stick with the wired ones, they're more reliable."
3,Not much better than the Wii sensor bar,"I got this wireless sensor bar because I thought it would improve the jittery-ness of the Wii cursor from my couch. It does, but only by a little bit. Hardly noticeable. Another reviewer suggested stacking it with the stock Wii sensor bar, but I can't say it worked for me. It works, I don't know about 25 feet like the packaging says though. If you are looking for a wireless sensor bar, I suppose this will work. If your looking for a sensor bar to expand your Wii's remote length, I don't know.I'll probably keep it around in case something happens to my stock Wii sensor, or I decide to mount my TV to the wall.The bright blue light on the front is kind of distracting too."
4,Wii Wireless Bar,Good product! Simplifies and eliminates wires. Make Wii use easier when components are in cabinetry.
1,No Good for Wall Mounted Flat Screens,"I've got a wall mounted flat screen. The original sensor bar's wire is too short to be routed through the wall and still reach (like all my other wires). It's also mounted high on the wall. SO I NEED the sensor bar to be mounted on the bottom so I can reach the ON/OFF button because it needs to be turned on and off independently of the WII (that kinda sucks). The thing needs 4 AA batteries = it's too heavy for double sticky tape to hold for very long. And you can't permanently mount it because the battery access is on the bottom that is up against the TV. I tried several ways to try and keep the thing mounted but ultimately had to DRILL into my TV's case (underneath) to make holes to run fishing line to hold it from falling off. I'll be looking for a better solution. So, if you have a flat screen mounted on the wall where you can't reach the top of the TV to turn this thing on and off ... well you've been informed and should know what you are in for."
4,Good stuff!,"UPS dropped off this DVD this morning at my doorstep. Yes, I've already watched it. : ) Anyway, I'm suprised at the quality of sound and video for this concert video. It's really pretty good, especially for something that was recorded in 1970. I thought the audience's response was pretty funny during the begining of the show. They just sat there as Emerson coaxed all sorts of neat sounds out of his Moog synthesizer. Back then synthesizers were pretty new and weren't often used in popular music, so I guess the audience was a little shocked! I agree with all the comments posted before me. It was pretty aggravating to see the video special effects and cartoons(?!). I'd rather see the musicians! If you liked ELP in their hey-day, I recommend getting this video. Just be aware that much of it does contain the video effects."
2,"Not nearly as good as the performance on ""Live at the Royal Albert Hall""","I suppose that if you are a committed collected of everything ELP, you might want to add this to your collection. But if you are just looking for a good live performance of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"", the performance on the ""Live at the Royal Albert Hall"" DVD is far more inspired and exciting. I am quite certain that ELP would tell you the same thing. The vintage performance just lacks maturity in musical performance, which the latter performance has in spades. And with the other DVD, you also get excellent live performances of a lot of other ELP stuff, including Tarkus, Knife Edge, Prokofiev, Pirates, and ""Fanfare for a Common Man"". The other DVD, of the performance at the Royal Albert Hall in the early nineties, is just infinitely superior in every way. But if you are a diehard collector of ELP stuff, you might still like this, but you'll also get some cheesy vintage '70s video effects."
2,Disappointed,"I have been an ELP fan from their first album onward. The CD version of ""Pictures"" is good but this DVD sucks. The sound is horrible and the ""psychedelic effects"" throughout most of the disc makes it hard to watch. Maybe good for one viewing but not something anyone would want to watch over and over."
1,Stealth,"Normally i write a review of extras and every part of a movie but on this one i will cut it short and to the point.We all have them, that one movie the one u watched once and thought why did i buy that this is that movieRent it, but wait let it hit the dollar shelf then rent it its really that bad.The movie rogue plain wants to destroy the world..... been done sucked then sucks now...lolthe extras i refused to watch anymore so i refuse to watch extrasAGAIN RENT IT WHEN ITS CHEAP AND ONLY WHEN ITS CHEAP ITS THAT BAD. ITS SO BAD AMAZON SHOULD BE EMBRARASSED FOR CARRY MOVIES THIS BAD...lol"
3,"When you see Jessica Biel on the cover, you know what the selling point is.","This movie is about a team of pilots who get a new wing man. It's an A.I. that is programmed to be the best fighter pilot in the Navy. Unfortunately, this A.I. learns from it's experience. It's commander's disregard for his orders on one occasion gives the A.I. the idea of going rogue. With a near perfect pilot without feelings on the loose, the 3 team members that are human must shoot their counterpart down, before it starts a war.This movie is pretty fun. It has a weak story and weak acting, but the action keeps you interested and relatively entertained. I've leaned that when you see Jessica Biel as one of the actors in a film, you shouldn't expect to much. This kind of movie is a dime a dozen. You know what you're gonna get. It's not bad, but it's not memorable either. Maybe you should just rent this one."
4,Stealth,"Enjoyed the movie- lots of action and cool high-tech stuff. Unfortunately, the plot was very predictable. Still, will enjoy having it as part of my library."
2,Not under the radar,"This is a so-so movie. Lots of special effects, a cute girl and some nice names in the cast. They left out most of a plot though. Its not bad but its not good. Watch this if you like the flash or want to be mildly amused."
2,Disappointed,"This movie was horrible. When planes go wild should be the title of this movie and it should've went straight to prime time for one showing only. I hate that Jaime Foxx was subjected to this movie. He clearly didn't read the script before he agreed to do this film, and get this... he dies!!! Ray dies!!! Of course the two prettiest actors live. And, if it was that easy to get from North to South Korea, infiltration would be a lot more common. Come on people, some people have been to Korea before and know that a chain linked fence is not what separates North and South Korea and even if it was, that girl still wouldn't have made it across. TERRIBLE MOVIE!!"
3,Top Gun it Ain't But it is Popcorn Fun,"Well what do you get when you mix purty people, purty machines and a purty aweful screenplay? You get this flick. Yes, the action is slick, the action is aplenty, but the storyline is so predictable and laughable, not to mention putting Josh Lucas as a male lead in an action movie. Casting directors take note: Don't Do It!!!! He's too sensitive and lisps way too much for an action star. Still, shut your brain down and enjoy. It is a let down performance for Jamie Foxx, after that tour-de-force in ""Ray."""
3,worth watching,"The good, pretty good action, pretty characters, good computer gone mad plot - nothing more. And the violence was as I like it, minimal blood, lots of action. The bad, 2 spots in the movie stood out. 1) In the very first attack on an underground terrorist cell, the soldiers were plastic and fake! I have no idea why they did that when all else was live actors or good CGI. Then near the end, a guy in a jet looks out of his window and spots a lady on the ground - at night, while taking hostile fire from below. I remember in the beginning of the movie - the computer was able to ID faces from heat, fingerprints, face recognition, yet at this moment, the computer did not help, just the guy looking out the window of a fighter plane in flight. Ha ha. But, it was entertaining."
3,Stealth,"Stealth has more action that I have seen from a film in a while. Jessica Biel was amazing as always. Josh Lucas did an excellent job as the main character. Although Jamie Foxx was pretty damn funny, he wasn`t at his best. I thought it was one of the best films about jets that has come out in a long time. I loved the idea of having a Robotic jet taking over for a pilot, instead of a human. Just makes you think of what could be happening in the next 15 years or so. The effects were spectacular and fast paced. I really enjoyed this film."
3,Blah...,"I do not know about you...but I found myself right away being led by action sequences...immediately, but there was very little story to tell you what is actually happening, and to me, this is the way that the film continued to be the whole time!!! I had to constantly ask what was going on, who was who, and yes, I was watching the movie just like everyone else. They were lost at times too....:( No wonder this film did not do that well in the box office!!!"
3,spotty video,"a fun popcorn movie with some memorable scenes,the blue-ray version offers some fine detail in many scenes but bad color in some.black levels are lacking though.a good movie for your ps3 if it's on sale."
3,Neither horrible nor spectacular,"The only thing I regret about this was paying $11.25 to see it at Grauman's Chinese Theater in LA rather than my usual $6.50 matinee price at my area Loews, as it had unfulfilled potential and needed a good amount of improvement. The story's iffy, Jamie Foxx's character's cockiness clouded his judgment (he selects missiles in a situation that really required guns, and pays for it dearly), and I really felt the jets' cockpits needed a severe redesign, such as improved canopy visibility. However, the visuals are spectacular and gives the technothriller junkies out there some new toys to chew on, such as the Talon jets (based on the Northrop Grumman Switchblade design), the AGM-2 Truncheon implosion bomb (the ultimate surgical weapon, as it can cause a building to collapse on itself without any real collateral damage), and the Camel Hump inflight refueling blimp. You're probably better off renting it or buying it used from Blockbuster."
3,"Sterile. Very, very sterile.","Let me start by saying, I love Arjen. I've got a pretty complete collection of his CDs and I listen to them quite regularly. I eagerly anticipated this new release and had it overnighted the day it was available.And ... I was dissapointed. I was very dissapointed. This album doesn't have the feel of a live album. The audience seems barely interested, the music is outright sterile, and the background singers they used leave a bit to be desired.The set list is good, and the songs are reproduced faithfully, but they lack feeling and emotion.Still a must-have for me, but not the gem of my colleciton that I was hoping it would be."
4,I can't stop playing this CD,"I love Bobby Valentino style of voice. But I feel like it will never top the first album because Tim and Bob who are my favorite producer did the whole album and understands Bobby's range. Even though I bought the album thinking that they were going to do more production, it's still not a bad CD. But i am still getting used to the diversity of the Cd because there are so many producers such as Brian Cox (Say Goodbye, Don't Mess With My Man, Rodney Jerkins (Say My Name, He Wasn't Man Enough For Me) and some unknown producer by the name of Andre Harris. I am listen to it now, I could say that it's worth a buy."
3,Not really worth buying.,"This book is just a compilation of pictures lifted from the other better Olivia books. It doesn't really tell a story or make the counting fun or interesting in any way. It misses the spirit of Olivia and seems like a half hearted cash grab, a definite low point on the Olivia franchise. You can have more fun counting things in the other Olivia books while reading a story."
5,Sunlight Lamp,"I love it! I have no windows in my office, but this lamp gives the feeling of sunlight!"
4,"Love this lamp, edited my original review","UPDATE: Since I wrote this review originally, Amazon began carrying replacement bulbs that fit this lamp (27 Watt SAD Sun Light Therapy Lamp Replacement Bulb). I ordered a couple of these replacement bulbs, and once received and installed, this lamp works great. I really like the shade of light that it emits, much more so than other desk lamps I've used with standard bulbs. I've upgraded my original review to give this product 4 stars, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to separately buy the bulb that should have came with it. If that hadn't happened, this lamp would've received all 5 stars from me!!Lamp was received without any bulb! Now, I can understand if this thing used a 'standard' light bulb, but this is a specialized bulb that I can't find anywhere locally. If it weren't such a pain, I'd return the whole darn thing. Buyer beware!!"
5,Very Funny; Yet Not So Funny,"This witty tale of the daily life of pharmaceutical peddlers will have you in thekind of stitches that don't require the doctor's needle and thread. But when the laughter stops, you realize that you have been reminded of the massive costsinvolved in the promotion of prescription drugs, costs that far exceed what is spent on those highly touted research labs. Thank you Mr. Reidy for some great laughs and the reminder of how much of our national prescription drug bill is wasted."
5,Great Quality,Great quality. Looks new. Enjoying the read and the book is nice and clean. Thank you for a quality product.
2,"This has been done before... ""Stir of Echoes""","Anwar and Whittaker can't save this movie. Weak writing and old special effects don't help. This is just ""Stir of Echoes"" in a swamp and snow."
4,little predictable but good,I have been looking for a good ghost story to come around. As a fan of the Ghost Story movie with Fred Astair and the Chowder Society. I was hopping that Hollywood would start coming back with some old fashion ghost stories. The creature stuff with the fancy graphics has become somewhat repetative. An American Haunting is another good break in the monotany.
2,Sub par,The book is easy to read and is humorous with the sarcastic remarks but is really sub par when it comes to substance. It doesn't adequately cover enough topics and doesn't provide enough detail. It's more like a series 65 for dummies.
2,Trying to be too cute!,"I started studying for the the Series 65 using this book. After a month, I was not doing very well on the practice exams and bought the Kaplan Financial study material. After two weeks with Kaplan I passed the exam. This author spends to much time and energy trying to be cute and not enough time on the really hard stuff in the exam's material. I do not recommend the book; you can do much better."
1,Better options avialable on Amazon,Better option to buy Lexar Media 256 MB USB 12X High-Speed CompactFlash Card (CF256-12-251). This new card is 12X v/s 4X and also cheaper !! Why buy a slower card and also pay more ?
5,Best Dolby Digital Home Theater System for the Price!,"I am truly amazed with this product from RCA. I was skeptical at what I was going to get for the price....but believe me, I am very pleasantly surprised. RCA delivers on every feature that is key to a quality home theater system. The only drawback is the quality of the speakers. They are very good for 50W speakers but like they say, speakers really make the system. For anyone on a budget, this system is the way to go!"
4,Está potente!,"Está um cd potentissimo!Drum and Bass puro e duro! Pormenor interessante : Dj-Kicks é feito por 2 senhoras Kemistry & Storm, pouco habitual no mundo da música deste género!?"
1,What a WASTE of Money!,"Bought it last year! Nice and small, but even Pinnacle Studio 8 can't handle the compression. No voice, can't burn to DVD, blah, blah, blah. You name it I had a problem with it! And now, come to find out, Sony has stopped production AND will no longer pursue MicroMV. They are moving back to MiniDV! ARGH! Pinnacle won't support their product any longer with this compatibility issue and Sony abandons it.I bought the Canon Elura 50! Great with stills and video. Inexpensive, only 1 ounce heavier and about the same size!As my wife called it...... I bought Beta instead of VHS! Never be an early adopter.Mark"
5,The number one gift on all my Holiday shopping lists,"Kaylie Jones has written an amazing book that's more literary than any suspense thriller I've read this year. Moving back and forth in time seamlessly, Ms. Jones gives us hints and clues of of the puzzle, as we learn more about the intertwined lives of the characters.I loved Clara Swerdlow -- she seemed so real I wanted to meet her. And Niko was the most sympathetic and brilliant killer since Hannibal Lecter.But maybe I've told you too much already!"
5,A little known treasure,"Beautiful story of generosity, love and abundance. This story illustrates how choices change our lives, but grace is present ."
5,THIS FILM WAS EXPENSIVE...,"1987, 102 min., Danish...for how old it is but it is supposed to be extraordinary. I was willing to pay the price because i love, i mean love, Karen Blixen or Isak Dinesen, whatever name you would like to call her as she had a few.I wish I could review this film but I cannot as I was sent a foreign version that none of my players can accommodate:( The company I ordered it from through Amazon ignored my complaints so I finally was wore done enough to just give up. I guess I made a donation to them. I didn't even get a thank you!However, I do know that Isak wrote a wonderful novel that was turned into the movie Out of Africa (must see!). One of my all time favorite movies, bar none!Have faith. :) I am saving up my recyclables to redeem for cash so I can buy it once again.At that time I will order, watch, review. Stay tuned."
5,Excellent Product,Product worked perfectly for organizing my son's video games. Very pleased with this eco-conscious product. Easy to assemble. Held 27 games in xbox and wii cases.
4,This Definitely Does NOT Suck!,"I ordered 2 of these boxes, and I really don't know what to think about someone who can't get them together easily. It took me less than 30 seconds to put them both together! my movies fit inside really well. I was very impressed with them. The only thing I am not crazy about it that you have to be careful putting the lids on because of the way the boxes are folded, but what do you expect? They are GREAT for only five dollars! I just put in an order for 2 more of them!"
5,I can't believe he used my email to review his own book.,"This is Joe Quirk's wife, using her work email. I stress ""work."" As in job. I'm tired of being the only income-earner around here while he ""studies"" monkey love on the internet. Joe, if you're reading this, don't forget to pick up my suit at the dry cleaners, and I expect dinner when I get home."
5,It's like Freakonomics...for getting your freak on.,"When it comes to sex and love, why do we act the way we do? Joe Quirk compiles decades of provocative scientific research from all over the world and turns it into a book that's fun, very readable, and often hilarious. You'll be quoting this one at the water cooler at work...or to your partner next time you're trying to explain yourself. ""Honey, I can't help myself. It's in my genes!"""
1,Just receive my pack,I ordered 4 of them and just received them. I should say they are with good quality however I just don't know why they are so little to handle. They are too small to use and I can't use it conveniently with this kind of size. I should say they are not worth of the price.
1,Kenny Rogers Christmas Special,"I enjoy Kenny Rodgers, but this special was filled with too much children, and very few of Kenny Rodgers actually singing Christmas carols as I expected it to be."
4,Harmony and string-filled country-bluegrass Christmas,"Ricky Skaggs' first Christmas album is a multiple family affair. In addition to vocals and picking by his children Molly and Luke, the album also features The Whites (Buck, Sharon, Cheryl, and Rachel) and members of Skaggs' band, Kentucky Thunder. The material leans heavily on American Christmas season standards, both high-spirited (""Let it Snow"") and faithful (""What Child is This?""), with a focus on multipart harmonies (rather than bluegrass picking) that will add warmth to any holiday celebration. The playing swings lightly on ""Let it Snow"" and ""Hangin' Round the Mistletoe,"" and the picking is sprightly on an instrumental rendition of ""Deck the Halls."" An Irish penny whistle combines with all-hands harmony rounds of ""Do You Hear What I Hear"" to close the disc with a flourish. [2005 hyperbolium dot com]"
4,This is a keeper,"I enjoyed this so much I purchased volume 2 also. A good mix of the traditional and modern, something for everyone."
4,Very good second caller ID phone,This is an excellent phone for the price but I have two complaints. 1. The Caller ID doesn't light up. So when the phone rings and you're asleep you have to turn on the light to see who's calling. 2. It doesn't have Caller ID with call waiting. Other than those two items I really like this phone for the bedroom.
1,Would not recommend this phone,"I also found this phone to drain the batteries within the first month. The caller ID did not work properly. The number displayed when the phone rang was the prior phone call. The new number would not show up until the next imcoming call. Also the buttons on the handset for the caller ID are on the outside, which I found to be bothersome if you want to cradle the phone between your ear and shoulder (hands free use). We returned ours."
2,Not Very Good,I bought this movie like many others because I love Alexis Bledel. It was very disappointing and I think I could have found something else better to spend $5 on. 15 minutes in I was completely bored and wondered where Alexis was and when she will appear. Then the whole it being a movie in a movie was just weird. I did not care for it and now it will sit on my shelf collecting dust. I wanted him to end up with Kate not Jill and the whole way they broke up before the wedding was strange and I just did not care for any of it. A normal love story would have worked just fine.
2,its ok,"It has too many characters and story is fair. Although I like the actors,they did good but too bad the story was lousy."
5,Great back story,"Following the war over newspapers, one never got the big picture view - all of the stories seemed to be human interest stories.This documentary has candid interviews from very knowledgeable and thoughtful people and allows someone to understand how the Surge unfolded in a really unique way while remaining accessible and interesting."
3,son loves but read before buying,"My son and I absolutely love this car. He was so excited when he first got into it (he's 1). There are only two problems with it though- there is no on/off switch, so even when he's not in it he can press the button and make it go. Well that's not good because he rolled over his feet once and the second time he was leaning against it and pressed the button and it dragged him and caused him to fall. The other thing also is that the sides aren't high enough so he sticks his feet out of the sides. Also, if your child is tall (mine is 31 inches) they may not fit comfortable in the car."
5,Missing Track,"Great album, seared into my memory after an allnight party in 1970.Got the import yesterday and am playing it over and over.I'm sure a track is missing. Here are the lyrics as I remember them, and please correct me if this is not on the original album.She stood in the streetHolding her hat in her handsI think I understandHow she's leading me onWith a smile just like dawnO how I criedO how I criedCalling all Catmother fans, help me, you're my last hope."
2,Sampling set is very small,"The opinions in the book were built around a very small sampling set of 890 households, too small to provide a meaningfull analysis."
1,permanent damage to lungs with high OZONE creating machines,just found out that similar products like this can cause permanent lung damage (i.e.asthma) if the ozone levels are high. yes these machines work but at what risk?
4,"maybe its too soon to tell, but so far im loving it","i just got this today after my old sharper image one just broke down and stopped workingim loving the size of this one, its nice and small, and it looks like it works just as welli think its very much worth the money (i paid $83 for it, with free shipping)i guess time will tell if i'm right :)"
1,The book that made me hate accounting...,"I really liked accounting, at least how it was presented to me in lecture. However, whenever I had to turn to my textbook I only became more confused. This book should never, ever, be used by anybody for any reason under any circumstance."
2,Not a very good textbook,This textbook is not very good. The chapters do not cover the subject material very well at all.More advanced subjects are not covered in the book and you are instead referred to a website. That is ridiculous. The treatment of inventories is especially terrible.I would not recommend this book.
1,Not so hot,"This movie is not so hot. It's way too long, for one thing. They just waste a lot of time. If it had been an hour long, it might have been pretty good. They stuck Jimmy Stewart in for a half hour that had nothing to do with the movie, he wasn't a very cool character like he usually is, and it was just [dumb]. I'll say one thing for it, though: the music was beautiful."
2,Wanted To Like It,"I had never seen this film in all of my years and always wanted too. Unfortunately, I have to agree with most everyone. It moves so slow. I kept thinking that it HAD to get better, but it just plodded along like an old tired horse. The Dodge City scene leaves you scratching your head. It did not match the rest of the film at all and wasn't even funny. Now, the photography is beautiful, the scenery is beautiful and the transfer is beautiful. I made myself watch it to the end, and even listened to some of the commentary. One very interesting moment of the film and commentary (SPOILER) is one of the very last scenes when the Indian chief shoots his son. This was filmed on November 22, 1963 at the very same time as the JFK assasination. This troubled Sal Mineo for years. Interesting trivia, and unfortunately, this is all I will remember about the film."
3,"OK, but definatly not the best",it was OK until Amy decided to go to college. i originally thought Amy would never even think about leaving Heartland. i hope that in 20 she decides to stay at Heartland
3,Please don't stop,I have not seen this book yet. But I will. I started reading heartland books by my mom renting #6 from my school library. And I was just hooked. I even got 3 buddys to start reading them. then one of my friends said that they would stop at # 20. I don't Know what I would do if they stoped. [Please] do not stop writeing them laurn Brook. Please Please Please Please Please.
2,don't do it,"It was not at all like any other belly dancing videoes I have. she runs through quickly, is annoying and goes w/less tradtional moves to give it a ""modern"" feel. If you want to learn the true dance try Venna and Neena. They walk you through everything and are great preformers, you start to feel after a few times you know what you are doing, and my husband appeciated the results after their videos. But this one is only good for a workout not learning tradtional belly dancing."
1,"Manseau yes... others, uh uh!","A recent dynamite book I really enjoyed is Peter Manseau's ""Songs for the Butcher's Daughter."" It was totally engrossing. ""A story of love, hate, Jews and typesetting."" I laughed, I cried, I did all the things critics say you should do with a good book.So now I am slogging my way through Peter Manseau's ""Killing The Buddha - A Heretic's Bible."" It's a compendium of variously authored pieces dealing with the religious experience in America; Which could be a helluva book. But this one is just pretentious BS for the most part. The stuff Manseau (or Sharlett) writes to connect the pieces is good reading: i.e., interesting, timely, well written, accessible, etc., but the actual articles are mostly just some artsy-fartsy folks getting a kick out of making simple things needlessly obscure and pedantic. Also, despite the title, there is not a heck of a lot of Buddhism in the book, either. Save your money."
4,This book tells it true,The writers are all preachers here. Preaching the gospel of the truth of the soul. The truth of the eyes and ears and fingers and tongue. The truth of experience. Of odd questions and sublime answers. Or maybe the other way around. It'll set your head spinning. In the best possible way.
2,Only the tip of the iceberg.,"The authors ask the reader to imagine working in the British Air Ministry during the war. The book then provides photos and drawings of specific German aircraft and brief bits of intelligence, each entry following the other in chronological order as new information became available, to piece together the development and use of the aircraft. The problem is the information was often fragmentary or incorrect, being limited to the time period in question. The book also gives a behind the scenes look at the way the Air Ministry collected intelligence. As a Luftwaffe enthusiast, I found a few obscure items worthy of note, such as the locations of crashed German aircraft. I don't believe the public would find this book interesting at all since much better books with accurate information have been published. And if you are interested in a specific aircraft, buy another book about it."
3,comfortable,"I just received and assembled the chair. Like another review, the ball seems way too small, but I am taking the manufacturer's recommendation to inflate as the ball expands. Hopefully it will, as it is currently VERY low to the ground and I have to bend my legs back to sit (I am 5'10"").On the bright side, I switched from my regular desk chair (my bf constantly complained about it - that it hurt his back. The only issue I had was slouching. I think both of these issues are from towering over the desk) and have been sitting in this one for 15 minutes. It is very comfortable and definitely forces me to sit up straight (which might be bc I am so short at my desk now!)I have given 3 stars based on the current size of the ball. I will alter my rating/comment in a week or two."
2,Ball Is WAY Smaller Than Expected,"I just put my chair together and the ball is significantly smaller than the one pictured on the site. It doesn't touch the backrest or the front constraint and it is about 5 inches shorter than the one pictured. I feel like I am sitting on the ground and the ball is not held in place very easily. A lady in my office has the exact same chair and same brand but her ball is a lot bigger than the one I received. I would still love to find a ball chair but am at a loss of where to look, this is the second one I have ordered and received with a ball that is too small. I took pictures of my chair and did a side by side comparison with the one featured on the site and would love to upload it but am unable to."
3,Gaiam Ball Chair,"The chair seems fine; however, the thing they provide to inflate the ball is terrible. It stopped working almost immediately. Now I have to find a way to inflate the ball before I can use the chair. Not too happy about this!"
4,Giam Ball Chair,"Great size, however the side of the wheels are sharp and I've scraped myself a couple times already."
5,Love at first sit,"So, I have only sat on this for about 5 minutes, and I will obviously be updating.But the minute I sat on it, I felt it was just right.And my only reservation, that the back rest is too low to have an impact, is simply wrong. IN fact, it is so comfortable you may even be tempted to just slouch back and enjoy.Don't. Sitting up right feels so good and i have never found it easier. Even on $800 chairs, I feel I have to put thought and effort into it. Here you don't. You just sit. IN fact it pushes you to do it right.Perfect height for the desk (another concern--I am 5ft7).I put a towel on it just to avoid sitting on rubber.I have mild scoliosis and awful back pain. I feel this chair will finally do the trick.After all, you get to do stretching exercises right in your office!I'll be back soon for an update!"
2,Defeats the purpose,"After sitting on a true yoga ball for 3 years as my office chair the Balance Ball Chair sounded like a fancy upgrade for my new job, but I was disappointed. The quality of the product was fine, assembly was easy and it looked fine. But the base that the ball sits defeats the idea that you must use your abdominals to balance because it is completely stable. The rollers don't work very well on carpet and the wheels get locked very easy which makes motion even more awkward. I have returned the ball chair and am back to my yoga ball.Also, if you are tall, I would not recommend the balance ball chair. It says that is good for people up to 6'-0"" but I am 5'-10"" and it is very short. The exercise book that comes along with the chair has exercises that are only possible if you are 5'-2"" or shorter."
3,try plain ball instead,I've been using just a plain gym ball as a chair instead. You don't really need or miss the back because the ball gets you to hold your spine in correct allignment. So I recommend just buying a ball (much cheaper) and using that alone.
4,Nice...,"The first few days... even week or so of using the balance ball chair, it ass uncomfortable. I guess your body just has to get used to it. But I can feel the stretching in my lower back and sides as if I've been working out. I had to stand a few times throughout the day in the beginning before I got used to the chair... sometimes I still do depending on the day, but this chair is good for posture. The worst part of this chair is the noise it makes whenever you move... any improvements should include a fix for that! But I think this product is worth the purchase although I do wish it were cheaper."
5,Awesome..if you are having back problems,"I love this ball chair.I have L4-L5 disc bulge because of which I have a constant pain in my back. I work with computers and sitting all day at desk worsens the pain.But by using this ball chair for 4 weeks has reduced my back pain considerably, I don't have the pinching pain in my back.I would recommend anybody with the back pain. Don't straight way start using this for long hours instead use ball chair for 1-2 hours then conventional chair for 15-30 minutes alternatively."
2,Gaiam Balance Ball Chair,"I had been sitting on a yoga ball for the last 6 months but I really wanted to order the Gaiam Balance Ball Chair. After sitting just on the yoga ball, the Gaiam Balance Ball Chair did not work as good. I would recommend just getting the ball and skipping the chair."
2,"Good idea, bad execution",I'm mostly disappointed with Gaiam's customer service. The ball that came with my chair was NOT the same ball in all of the photos. It was more like a glorified beach ball and the chair was nowhere near high enough to reach any of the desks in my office. I took the tiny ball out and inserted my friend's Gaiam ball which is bigger and it works very well and I really love it! I wrote Gaiam days ago asking if they would exchange the ball for me but they have yet to respond so now I have to go SPEND MORE MONEY and get the proper ball. Such a disappointment and more trouble than I should have to go through.
2,unhappy,"I purchased the ""chair?"" for my daughter to use in her office.She doesn't like it at all. It is uncomfortable, it sits too low, not adjustable and overall a waste of money.I guess that you live and learn. No more purchases for me with-out seeing and trying out a product. Bye-bye any future buys from the internet!!!!!!Yours Unhappily,John Gustave"
3,It's OK but not impressed,I purchased because the keyboard tray height was too low to allow use of traditional ball for seating. The height is pretty good but I am only 5' tall. Cannot imagine this working for taller person. The back of the ball/chair is awkward - it is not meant for back support and sticks out quite a bit from the chair not as shown - takes up more space than it could with no obvious use. The ball portion is OK in comfort - could have gotten same results by purchasing a smaller ball than what I had.
3,Balance Ball,I found the ball to be too hard and uncomfortable as compared to the ball that I got from Wal Mart which was very comfortable but eventually sprang a leak. Altho I need the mobility that this ball chair gave me as I could turn around and with the ball itself I couldn't. I am a little disatisfied with the comfort.The product was sent quickly which was very satisfactory.
3,Inconsistent but nice,"We ordered four of these chairs for an event we were hosting and wanted to put these out for people to sit on. The first issue we had was that one of the placstic frames did not have the holes drilled through that you use to attach the back support to so we had to drill through. The second and weird issue was that three of the four balls were smaller than the fourth. They did not fill the space for the frame and sunk through to the ground. It was like the ""mold' was changed or something. The fourth was fabulous and we wished they would all have been as useful.I wish the quality would have been higher. Maybe another brand would have been better?"
3,Disappointing,"We are both in our 80s and my wife has used inflatble exercise balls for years. We also exercise regularly at a local community center. When we saw this promoted on the Instapundit Blog with some favorable comments we thought it might be very usefull for her at the computer and her knitting and sewing machines. She is barely 5' tall and it proved to be much too low for these purposes. We replaced the ball with a much larger one. I can use it at the computer but it still too low for her.We are now undecided if we should keep it for my occassonal use, donate it to a local thrift store or try to sell in on Craig's list."
3,Ball chair review,I purchased the chair for office use and have been sitting on a regular exercise ball prior to my purchase. The ball chair gives you the ability to swivel and move around but the ball is harder/smaller than the small exercise ball and therefore more dense and less comfortable to sit on.
2,What doesn't kill you makes you stronger -- maybe!,I bought the chair in mid-December it is now mid-January. It is very comfortable and good for my posture. The only issue I have -- IT STINKS!I keep the ball on my porch when not in use. After contacting Gaiam I was told to wait another month and if it still smelled they would replace it. Currently I can't use it for more than a half hour without feeling queasy. I am going to stick it out a couple more weeks and see if the smell subsides.
2,Gaiam Balance Ball Chair,The chair does not slide easily and the ball is too small for sitting at a desk. I had to replace the ball with a larger size to use it. With the ball replaced it is comfortable and useful. But it shouldn't take all of this to make it work!
1,Tall people only!,"You need to be at least 5'8"" for this chair to work the proper way, For your legs to be at a 90 degree angle they recommend. No other ball size is available and I contacted Gaiam about the problem but they just said it's not for everyone! Also the ball is very HOT to sit on for any length of time. Good luck with it if you try."
4,Balance Chair,"Three persons in our department are using the Gaiam Balance Chair. It works well, except the ball has to be reinflated more often than they thought. In order to stay seated on the chair, it requires good posture, so that is great."
3,"Gaiam chair, not bad","I have had major shoulder problems over the years and after many doctor's visits, weight lifting, and chiropractor suggestions, I was hoping that this chair would make a difference in my back posture as I sit at my desk most hours of the day. I noticed a difference right away, especially since I am not able to cross my legs as I sit, and I sit up straighter as to balance myself on the chair. I did experience a bit of lower back soreness the first week, probably from muscles in my back being used to support myself. Overall the chair seems to help me sit up straighter, however it is easy to still lean forward or slouch if I do not pay attention to my posture. This is not a 100% fix to my shoulder pain and posture, but it seems to be helping strengthen my core and back a bit."
4,balance ball chair,I've been using this at work since it arrived. I have back issues so it has helped keep the back pain to a minimum and is actually more comfortable than company issued ergo chairs. I gave it 4 stars due to quality control with the hardware provided like other reviewers the company sent metric nuts in stead of the 1/4 inch that were required to attach the restraining bar. Easy fix from your local hardware store.
2,avoid back injury,I wouldn't recommend this chair. After using it for a few months I ended up with a low back injury. You have to stay engaged the entire time you use the chair. Never slouch. If you have a weak back avoid this chair or any balance ball as a chair.
4,good but not as pictured,"it is a great item... definitely makes me move much more during the day as my work is sedentary... this is NOT a comfortable chair.. u won't curl up and fall asleep on it... but it serves its purpose... and it is fun to sit on it (now that novelty's wore off, I can objectively say that it is fun)... the ball included in the package is not as large as it is pictured on the box... so, you end up sitting lower and the back support is higher than you expect it to be by looking at the picture... otherwise I like it... and recommend to you if you spend a considerable chunk of your day sitting..."
5,My favorite chair,"I teach at two schools. After buying one ball chair for one of my music rooms, I had to splurge and buy a second for the other room. I LOVE these chairs. I'm overweight and my lower back often gripes, but these chairs give me a comfortable sit. I've had them since I first saw them about 10?+ years ago. Still have the same chairs and balls, except I am replacing one of the balls that developed a leak after a couple of my students had a bouncing contest when I had my back turned. MORAL #1: You'll love this chair. MORAL #2: Never turn your back on your students."
5,Great chair!,Wonderful - comfortable and great for stretching while I'm waiting for my computer to boot up in the morning. Best of all it's fun to sit on!
1,Painful!,"Wow, judging by all of the previous raving reviews, I guess I must be from another planet. I absolutely hated this chair. Very uncomfortable. Increased my neck pain and caused back pain. Also my butt was sore after sitting on this thing for more than 15 minutes AND my legs felt cramped. My son, who also spends many hours each day at his computer didn't like this chair either. My wife said it made her legs uncomfortable. This baby is being shipped back for a refund!"
4,Gaiam ball/chair,It's definitely improved my posture as I'm at my office at least 9-10 hours a day. You do have to re-pump once in a while. The wheels are cheaply made as one's already broken from rolling around a lot. Our office purchased 9 and only 1 of the pumps was in working order when we received them. The white tips either did not screw on as the screws were either warped or miasligned.
1,"Great printer, but unreliable and bad warranty service","Great little printer when it works. We bought two for our office. It is fast, cheap, has great print quality and a simple paper path. Here's the rub - made in China, some parts (the formatter especially) are clearly defective and failing early. When you contact HP for warranty support you will be offered a $50+ exchange (25% of what I paid for each of the printers). When you decline that you will be told that you can mail the printer in at your own cost and wait weeks for repairs because replacement parts are in short supply. Go figure. I plan on switching back to Brother, etc. for low-end printers. UPDATE - HP fixed mine and 60 days later the formatter in one failed again. Guess I'll throw it away and start over."
1,Terrible - purchase a different printer,"Brevity, will suffice. Numerous other reviewers have accurately pinpointed the problems. The machine consistently crashed about every three months. After a year it completely shut down - formatting board. With the extended warranty HP, was able to send me a replacement. Refurbished, not new! As I recall, it still cost me $50. The skin was marred/scratched in several places. Yet, it does seem to ""boom along"" as required. Off-brand replacement cartridges will not work in this machine. I chatted with the techies about this issue and they said the built-in, proprietary smart chip prevents their utilization. Purchased a HP cartridge from Amazon. Works great, print fades after 900 pages - can't be fixed. Not a good choice for home or small office. Looking for an alternative printer."
1,I HATE YOU HP Laserjet 2015dn,"I am so sick and tired of this printer. Had it for two years now. I'm already ready to chuck it out of my 3 story window. That's how much I love this hunk of junk.1.) issues with driver2.) no support on hp site or phone service3.) i've tried my 5th driver, still no good because sometimes it prints ghost papers4.) paper spool died on me after a year, so I replaced itThe positives are I've rarely had to deal with paper jams, it's fast, and I'm ready to get a new printer"
5,Beautiful,"I bought this book for my Dad, who is a water-colorist. He paints tall ships and other types of ships. He thought the book was beautiful."
4,Great!,"Without words! the best of the best. If you like hot sauce try it.Is really hot, spicy and delicious."
3,Not the very best,"My son is 47 months and I started buying these pull ups online as I do not see the 88 count box in the stores. Its convenient for me and my son as he no more has to lay down for a change. Opening the pull up when changing is very convenient. My son can easily put a new one himself.PROBLEM:The only problem I have experienced is that my son has been wetting his pajamas (and bed also) in the night time during sleep. It looks like it leeks. My son's waist is small so maybe during sleep when he pees, the pull up does not holds the pee and leeks."
1,Be aware of the expiration date,"Did you know that diapers have expiration date? Well, you better be careful when buying this product.When my order arrived, I opened the box and took one of the inside packages of diapers (there are 2 packages/box) and found out it had already expired a month ago. I called amazon and let them know about the expired diapers and they said they were going to send another box. After two days I received the replacement....but....for my surprise, it was also expired! I called amazon again and let them know my disappointment and they refund the money. The problem here is that the expiration date comes in the inside package not on the outside carton, so you have to open the box to realize what the exp date is."
3,Period piece,"I must have read this many years ago. The technology is clearly dated, and the book, while it is fairly well written, becomes uninteresting as a result."
5,NO BETTER DEAL!,"I'm a very big researcher when it comes to product buying and I searched high and low for a car charger that would give me the best deal. At other stores, for just the car charger, it was more than this due pack. Not only that, but it included the plug-in for me to charge my Nano through my iTrip. I have yet to use the wall charger since I am in my car quite a bit but I love that the plug folds in. I keep it in my travel suitcase for when I know I'll need it. Amazon's free shipping was an added bonus that I just couldn't pass up."
3,Works Some Of The Time,"This product is universal, so I was surprised to find out that it didn't charge while using the Griffin fm transmitter. This was why I chose the powert duo in the first place so it kind of upset me.Later when I tried it in my car it worked so hey it works sometimes!"
3,Little disappointing,My friends recently purchased an ice cream maker and made some fabulous ice cream. I got so excited I ran out and bought one too. I wanted to try my hand at some exotic yet easy to make ice cream. This book features way too many complicated recipes calling for the custard style ice cream (with eggs.) I went online and found easier and better recipes than what I found in this book. You don't need this book- just go online.
4,Good Recipes for Ice Cream,"This book is very thorough, well-organized, and easy to use. I like the diversity of recipes, although I find that the ones that came in the little brochure with my ice cream maker are the ones I use more often. (Because I think they are even easier.) I am glad I bought the book and get a lot of pleasure from its recipes."
4,Comprehensive and to the point,"I reference this book frequently, and have been pleased thus far with the recipes I've made.While you may not learn much about ice cream technique or theory, you will make a number of delicious, icy treats that will leave you feeling cold about the stabiliser-filled commercial product. An acceptable addition to a newbie ice cream-maker's bookshelf."
3,There Was A World Before Cell Phones,"When this book was first published - in 1981 - there must have been a need for it. The most interesting section in the book is a few pages about the technology of radio telephones - the grandfather of the modern cell phone, but there's not much else to recommend it for the modern reader.The book contains a schematic diagram of a TAD-20 answering machine, as well as a few other models of Radio Shack answering machine products. Other than that, the technology described is now primitive - such as a call diverter, which is what we now know as call forwarding. The author had a very intricate knowledge of answering machines, but these have been rendered obsolete, and so has the usefulness of this book, unless you need kindling for firewood or you have a wobbly coffee table leg that needs to be propped up."
4,Good condition and fast shipping,"The book was in good condition, the only problem is that it's binded and this was not mentioned in the product description"
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this for my daughter because I loved the bath and bumper so much. However it was a joke. Completely worthless, it did absolutely nothing to support her when she started sitting on her own. I tossed my after about 2 uses. Your better off with the old fashioned plastic ring seats. Seriously don't waste your money. I can't imagine how anybody could find this prodcut useful."
1,Get a seat instead,"I would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all! This seemed like a good idea, but my little guy was kicking and moving all over. It barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath. It also says that it is for 0 months on up, but I definitely wouldn't use this if your baby can't sit."
2,Not worth it!,"I agree this is a waste of money! It does not float like package says. It sinks immedietly. I don't see that it would work well with a sitting baby. It worked ok for in infant, just lay across like you would a boppy pillow, but it is heavy when wet and takes at least 24 hours to drip dry. I am returning mine to the store, as soon as it does dry. Seems like an inflatable pool ring would serve the same purpose, work better, not sink, be easy to clean and no need to dry. I'm gonna give this a try!"
4,Nice case,"Not too hard and not too soft. Camera fits nicely, with compartments for just about anything you need for your camera."
4,Fowler is Back on Form,"This short story collection puts Fowler back on the map. Strange and quirky little stories. What a warped mind this guy must have. Monkeys falling in love? Where did that come from? I read this book over a weekend, and I don't think I have ever read a book that fast."
1,Demonized by Christopher Fowler,"Disappointing short stories, not to be confused with the absorbing ""Peculiar Crimes Unit"" books which are a joy."
5,Little Book with a Big Spirit,"Although a small book in size, the spirit within ""A One-Legged Cricket"" is big. I recently read this book for a second time - this time on my Kindle - and loved it even more this time 'round. It's a beautiful reminder that we can endure the things we think we can't, and even grow through our grief. It's one of those books that should be read again and again through the years to help keep our spirits balanced."
1,"Well, it is a mint flavored liquid...","I trust Listerine and supposed that this product would also be a reliable oral antiseptic. I was wrong. It is not antiseptic, according to the label! - the same label that is not displayed in this website page. Furthermore it foams up in a most alarming manner. I have dumped the rest of the bottle down the drain. Ick. What a disappointment. I gave it one star because it is a mint flavored liquid."
3,Listed wrong,"Item description insicated that it would fit a certain model and when received, tge holes did not line up right"
4,Functional and inexpensive but not great,"The good news is that it's very inexpensive and relatively well built. The tweezers are the best I've ever used, the toothpick works well, and the corkscrew and screwdriver are both quite functional. If you want a nice cheap utility tool this is a pretty good deal. The bad news is that the blade does not lock open so it can be somewhat dangerous depending on how you use it. It's also not very sharp and needs to be honed when you first get it. The nail file is useless. I got this one as a gift but would haver preferred a model that came with scissors too."
1,BORING. 24th dec 2004.,"Hi, anyone who is thinking on buying this game, don't bother to. Unless you are into the old type of films made by this studio. It was a birthday present for me and i was quite excited about it until i realised all it was just films that were made quite a while ago. the game is quite good if you like the type has described. This description is just my opinion but it is just a saying to tell you instead of wasting your money on. I only doubt the game partly aswell because it wasen't long enough. If you are a genius at these types of movies then you will pretty sure get around the board quite quickly. I have seen scene it and i have not had it yet but it seems better for any new or old movie."
2,Why all the re-enactments?,"There must be thousands of hours of actual footage existing of these events , so why all the tacky, low budget, fictionalized re-enactments? (I suspect to appeal to young people who refuse to watch anything in black and white or listen very long to a narrator.) The actors hired to play Patton, Montgomery and Eisenhower don't even look like the real person, and sound even more ridiculous. The actor playing Patton is especially bad.The facts are here if you're interested in this subject. But it's almost ruined by the fictionalized dialogue and campy presentation."
4,And now my new favorite,"OK, Little Things was my favorite, but this book was better by far. The reason? SPIKE. After so many books where he was just mentioned as an afterthought, the writers are finally getting around to him. And this writer clearly knows how to play on his dual character. Other reviewers have mentioned the lack of Buffy and most of her friends, but I was just thrilled by it. Actually, there is less of Willow than the cover suggests. This is a book for Spike fans, and hopefully the first of many, many to come. Unless Buffy is with Spike (or Angel), she is just of no interest. But, when she is with either of these guys, it doesn't get any better. For all you who love Buffy herself, hey, you've got dozens of books.The only thing I didn't like about this book was the ending. The last 5 or 6 pages left me thinking my book was defective, and something was missing. What the heck actually happened there?"
4,"Awesome monitor, mediocre speakers.","This is an awesome monitor. It matched my iBook's screen perfectly in terms of color. It is also seriously bright. I mean, you can light up a small room. The only downside that I can find on this LCD is it doesn't have different presets, for night use, day use, gaming, etc, which some LCDs do. Also the OSD menu is a little hard to navigate.Speakers are not very good at all, but at this price, it doesn't matter. If you want good speakers, you're going to buy speakers, not a LCD & Speaker combo unit. It's common sense.Overall, this is a 4 Star display, only because of the cons above. Highly recommended, especially if you care about color and if you own an Apple display and want to add this to it in screen spanning."
1,WARNING: IMAGE BURNS,"I bought this monitor and about six months later images began to burn-in across the top of the screen. I'm not talking about images that burn in after you leave a program open for eight hours without a screensaver. No, this monitor gets image burns after using a program - ANY PROGRAM - for only a few minutes. They do go away...if you turn your monitor off and unplug it from the power source FOR ABOUT A WEEK! And then the burn-in images come back after about FIVE MINUTES of surfing the web! By the way, ViewSonic's ""Limited Warranty"" apparently does not cover image burns, so don't waste your time calling customer service. When it comes to computer monitors, better stick with tried-and-true brands: Sony, HP, etc."
2,"Nice Picture, Terrible Life","I have one of these at work. It was new out of the box probably two months ago and already has images starting to burn in. That is just pathetic. The speakers are ""OK"" for integrated monitor speakers. The picture quality is very nice at it's native resolution... but I wouldn't recommend this monitor to anyone. Ever. Burn in after just a few months is totally unacceptable."
1,NOT THE RIGHT CARDIO PARTY!,"THEY SENT ME CARDIO PARTY ONE NOT THREE AS STATED I AM BEYOND LIVID! I had waited and waited to get this and it's the one I have done 1000 times! I have this already on dvd! I was looking forward to something new! I AM SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED that I got the same one I already own and am bored with, have to return this and pay $6, and wait a month for it to be credited back on my card! THEN I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FROM SOMEONE ELSE! THEN I HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN FOR IT TO COME IN THE MAIL SO I AM ABLE TO DO THIS WORKOUT! PAY ATTENTION!"
5,think about it,you're buying an ORGANIZER. most likely because you tend to forget things (unless you're a tech nerd like me) so chances are you'll lose a stylus or two. do yourself a favor and buy these now!
4,Watch Shipping,"These are great - and I thought cheap to replace. We purchased from a different Website last time (about 2 years ago) and our company has finally lost them all (we do Pre-Sales, so the guys out in the market keep track of them for about 6-8 months). I went to reorder on Amazon & can only purchase 3 at a time. Seller wants to charge me $3.99 shipping on EACH pack of 3. Shipping ends up being more than the item...I am trying to find out how to contact seller, but running into brick walls...too bad too, these are the ones our guys want & the only ones on Amazon, so I'll have to go elsewhere."
3,Close But No Cigar,"I was excited to see a new history book on El Capitan, but the final product was short of my expectations. Duane draws a few good observations and insight at times, but the guts of the book strike me as a rehash of articles from all kinds of other publications. I have an unusually large collection of climbing literature, which may skew my observations because I've seen so much of the raw historical material he draws from for the book in so many other places. I don't mind that so much, but I was hoping to hear some of the not-so-well known stories of adventures on El Cap and a little more new insight into the historical figures of the big stone. It just wasn't there for me. People who are not so read up on climbing history will probably find the book more enjoyable. The book is an incredibly quick read (not that much text, but lots of pictures) for a subject that could easily justify a much larger book."
3,Interesting!! But...,It's an interest book. But...why Commander Sela and Donatraweren't there? I wanted to see that they're all right(;.;)
5,Shatner is King,"I have to say that if they go ahead and fire Rick Berman as head of all things Star Trek they should really consider, in fact I'd be comfortable to demand, that Shatner be put in charge. Every time one of these movies come out beginning with Star Trek: Generations it takes Shatner's novels to fix all the problems. Captain's Blood does it again explaining all the problems with Star Trek: Nemesis.I enjoyed this book. While The Return is easily the best of the series, this one is right up there with the best."
3,Puzzles are pretty easy,"If you are just learning Sudoku these might be enjoyable, but the majority of these puzzles are very easy."
1,Simply Does NOT Work,This is not a wax but rather a sugar-based product. It just does NOT work -- on the legs one would have to do the same spot over and over again to see any good results; and for eyebrows - simply useless: it does not pick up the tiny hair -- which is the whole point of waxing eyebrows. Waste of money.
3,The picture is misleading,"The picture showed two small jars, but received a large jar instead and it became not so sticky after a period(far from used up)."
2,VERY Disapointed...,"This did not remove hair well at all for me. I'm so disapointed! I even purchased an electric warmer to go with it, thinking I was really going to love this method. I had been using an epilator on my legs and underarms so it's not like my hair was stiff, and it is certainly not thick. I waited until the hair was long before I started using Moom but would have to apply and remove over the same area two to three times and still not remove every hair. What a shame.Toni"
1,Didn't work!,It's so gosh darned frustrating when I order a product with great reviews....and then it blows!I tried the product every which way: tried places on my body with thinner hair...then coarser hair....I tried heating it up more....then a little less.....I tried applying a thin coat....then a thicker coat.NOTHING WORKED!!! Don't waste your time friends!
4,mixture has strange composition but is otherwise fantastic,"Before using this, I highly recommend watching the how-to video offered by Moom's website. My first attempt was less than satisfactory. I heated the product over the stove and had an issue getting everything to the right consistency. There seems to be a stubborn blob that refuses to thin out like the rest of the mixture. I ended up dipping the applicator sticks to the bottom and swirling the liquid from the bottom on top and using that instead. It works great and barely hurts :-). Prior to this, I've only used epilators so my pain tolerance might be slightly higher than someone with no experience with depilation."
2,Not for me,"This wax doesn't have a good grip of the hair. I have to use it on the same area multiple times to get rid of the hair, and my hair is not even thick. The only thing that I like about this product is the cloth that comes with it which I use it for another wax. The wax itself was not a really good one, and it gets cool down easily. When I use the other wax, I don't need to reheat it but I have to do it a few times."
1,Just doesn't work,This stuff is really difficult to use and literally did not remove one hair from my face. Waste of money.
5,Love this stuff,"I absolutely love this stuff - no chemicals and best of all, works like a wax without the hard to clean up mess of wax! I have sensitive skin and this made my skin feel smooth and not irritated at all. i will definitely be buying more!"
2,Didn't work as well as I hoped,"I didn't find this to really work well at all. I tried it on my legs (after I let my hair grow out for 2 weeks like it said to do) but only removed some of the hair and not very much of it. Its worked better on my eye brows I didn't turn as red as i do with wax and I didn't brake out as much. I'll just stick to wax for my legs, it may hurt a little more but at least it works."
1,Not for me,"Seeing all the great reviews, I decided to purchase this item. As instructed, I heated in 10 second intervals. Product refused to heat up. After 40 seconds, it was suddenly too hot. It did not take all the hairs in area applied and took several times to get it completely hair free. Only lasted two weeks and then I noticed some ingrown hairs. Definitely would not purchase again."
1,did not work,"I tried to use this several times, same results - NONE. I did everything the instructions said and just ended up with a mess of wax on myself. Would not recommend."
1,Doesn't work,"I used it like the directions said, but it didn't work. Not one hair removed! It was terrible. All the pain, none of the gain. Also, can't be returned. Don't buy."
2,"Good For Others, But Not For Me","I don't think this is a bad product, but my hair is just too think for this wax to work and it had no affect removing my facial hair which was my biggest concern."
1,Does Not Work on Fine Hair,"I have waxed quite a bit before. I have gotten it professionally done but I mostly do it myself. This was the most ineffective kind of wax I've used. I tried it on my legs and it only pulled out a few hairs. I am Asian so I don't really have that much body hair to remove and the hairs that I do have are extremely fine. Perhaps if you have thicker hair, it will work. If you have Asian or fine hair, you will most likely have the same results that I did."
1,does not work,"I am pretty experienced with all types of hair removal, especially waxing. This product is extremely inefficient, in fact, it didn't work at all for me. Not sticky at all: I tried different temperatures, and applied different quantities - it didn't grab any hair every time. I find this really frustrating given my experience and the other reviews, so my guess is that I was sold an old wax or something..."
4,good enough for this beginner!,"I have no experience with waxes or creams or any of those hair removal products other than those for shaving, and I tend to be clumsy and messy with this sort of thing, so I was a little worried about using Moom. After a couple of practice strips I found this product to be easy to use, easy to clean up, and effecient (even on my stubborn asian hair). It also didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. Finally, since the strips are durable and made of thin fabric, I could rinse each strip in a little bowl of water immediately after I used it and it would soon be dry and ready to use again or to be put away."
1,Leaves too much hair behind,"I wanted to love this stuff. It sounds wonderful! Less mess and gentler on the skin! But none of that matters if it does not actually remove all the hair. I followed the directions exactly. (No, really, I did!) I thought I might get better with practice. I tried over and over again for months. And still, it leaves behind 25%-50% of the hair on my upper lip. My hair might be slightly more tenacious than average, but not THAT much worse. The people giving this stuff rave reviews either have the wimpiest hair on the planet, or they're paid to post fake reviews. I'm asking for my money back."
4,good product,"this is good product ... i just test it and works great, at first i don't understand how to use this, but than i read instructions and everything was as described"
5,Wow,Havent tried a whole lot of waxing products but this stuff seems pretty legit. still hurts of course but seems to not irritate.
2,sticky!,"I got this product because I am a sucker for organic products. I was very excited to use it but then the first time I put the wax in the microwave for the amount of time on the directions and the wax burned me. That wouldn't have been much of a problem since you can just put the wax in for less time. However the wax itseld was very sticky and messy and the strips did not work very well. Also it's kind of nasty to wash the strips each time because you're supposed to soak them in water and all the water and wax comes off. I prefer the strips that already have wax on them, they are much easier to use and way more effective!"
1,Smells like Crude oil Do Not Buy,"I ignored other reviews that referred to this smell problem, thinking that there are people on the Internet community that just are complainers.OK, add me to the list, I have had this ball for 60 days, I have washed it with warm water and soup, I have left it outside under the sun to get rid of the smell to no avail. My purpose for writing this review is for you the reader to take the review feed back seriously. I take a lose on this one. Amazon is not at fault here, this is just a poor Chinese manufactured product. I bet Amazon would have taken it back, had I not ignored my own judgment. What a laugh."
4,Exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced,"This was exactly what I was looking for, a medicine ball with a handle and it was so much more reasonably priced than the others I found. My only critique is that it has a very strong odor of industrial plastic...hopefully that will go away with time...otherwise perfect and does the job!"
1,Gaiam not much for customer service,Out of the box the DVD didn't work. Gaiam said I had to send them the DVD I had before they would send me a new one. I would avoid this product and look for something else.
1,Heavy Metal Fans........BEWARE!,"80% of my collection was not even listed in this book. I became very frustrated when they didn't even list the complete bands discography. To top that off, most were singles that were listed."
1,Muffled Handset,"While the speakerphone, in it self, works fine, the handset sounds awful and the volume control is poor. The louder you turn up the volume on the handset the harder it is to hear. I tried connecting my old handset and the sound was much improved. I wouldn't recommend this phone because of the cheap handset it comes with."
1,low price... low performance,"This phone does not have its own battery, so disconnecting the phone line erases the numbers that are stored in memory.During one month of use, this phone went ""off-hook"" on its own at least 3 times in the middle of the night. I promptly discarded it."
3,"Useful for end users, but overpriced","As end users start migrating to Linux, it's only natural that Linux books start appearing on how to obtain and use software (and not just administration and development tools). In that vein, this book contains an extremely thorough survey of audio software that would take quite a while to investigate on your own. If you are a Linux user (or a potential Linux user) interested in finding good tools for music and sound, this book is an excellent resource.Having said all that, I think the list price the publisher set for this book is ridiculous. For under [price], this book would be a slam dunk. But I expect even a lot of people who are interested in this information will find it hard to justify the price, especially when a lot of it will be obsolete in a year or two. Five stars for the content, one star for value."
2,Just a list of dated Linux software,"I found this book disappointing. It is not a technical work on how to create or manipulate sound on Linux, but is just a list of the software available. It is fairly dated now as well. I'd say that you are better off typing 'linux music sound software' into google and saving the money, or if you're after technical information, leave off the 'software'."
3,Pampers Easy-ups,"This is one of the easier ways to put a diaper on, and it comes off easy too. One thing though: its not as absorbent as the Huggies natural fit. Since he isn't potty trained yet, I change him myself and i find that i'm doing so every hour because he's soaked. the diaper also leaks because on a number of occasions, in the morning the area underneath him is drenched."
3,"This are ""just the highlights"" and nothing more...","For those of you out there that maybe are looking something like I did, that is, a video that compacted the action of the world's best golfers, this is not it, ok. I was expecting the highlights of all the major stars in golf to review their swing styles, but this is not the DVD intended for that. It is more concentrated in the tournament, Tiger Woods (of course!) and Chris Dimarco, not even all of the other top shots like Vijay, Michelson, Els, Goosen, Love, etc. have their own spot, instead just a slight flash of how they lost their opportunity.But if you're looking for ""Just the Highlights of the Masters"" this is a good DVD. And don't expect a very elegant film production with great narration like those NFL films either."
1,Pitiful,I am a hard core Norah Hess fan and I have to say this book was totally awful. For starters the character names are so ridiculus that I had a hard time getting past that . Next there is no plot to speak of and the characters are completely 1 dimensional. Half way through the book you dont know anything to speak of about them and frankly you dont care. Please dont waste your time or money with this book. Norah Hess has some wonderful books out there unfortunetly this is not one of them.
5,The Best Book I Ever Read!!!,"I can't even count how many times I have read this book. This was the first book by Cusick I had read and it got me hooked on the rest of her work. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a little mystery, horror, and romance in their lives."
5,Thanks for giving me 20-20 realestate vision.,"I have read a lot of real-estate books, so many that I was loosing tract of who was a scammer and who was real. In my most recent state of author induced real-estate confusion; I remembered Tom's book ""The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit"" being the most honest and informative books I have read in real-estate in a long time. So with that thought, I bought his new book ""The No-Nonsense Real Estate Investor's Kit""; this book helped ground me again. I am no longer afraid to enter the market any more. While I know I will never know everything about this subject, Tom helped me to see the common pitfalls other wannabees permanently loose their footing in.I still plan on reading other authors books; but I can guarantee you, I will read every one of Tom's books more than once.My background kind of goes like this, ""I am just an average guy with above average ambition and the horse power to see it through."" :>)Semper fi,Tom"
5,Absolutely Addictive and Fantastic,"I got up at 6 in the morning on a working vacation so that I would have time to read this incredibly engaging, well written and fascinating story of the rise and fall of Enron. I work in a corporate environment and find the characters and situations totally believable. I have already decided I am reading it again. Highest recommendation. The BEST I've read in years."
4,what a spectacle....,"It must be so wrong that this was such an entertaining read! But I enjoyed it. That said, the contant references and explanations to the subtle nuances of accounting principles may be lost on quite a few of us. If you can't follow the logic, just remember that they did it wrong...that's all.For all of us who've worked in a corporate environment, it is real easy to identify with the characters depicted in this book. One that stands out is the power-hungry and arrogant CFO, Fastow. I could not help but wonder how he managed to hood-wink the CEO and the Board time after time. Fastow's inner circle extended to key partners in crime throughout the organization and also at Andersen, allowing him free reign as he plotted his road to riches, and the eventual downfall of Enron..."
5,"The ""Must Read"" Enron book","I highly recommend this book. I am an auditing professor and use it in my classes, and before I read it thought I knew all there was to know about Enron. The narrative is gripping, and the ""True Story"" is almost unbelievable, particularly as it reveals what each actor was thinking before they acted. If this book becomes a video it will be difficult to capture."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I do *not* have a high degree of financial acumen, but this book laid out what was really wrong with Enron in a thoroughly engaging manner. I couldn't put it down, and I finally understand the financial reasons for the collapse, not just managerial incompetence...which was EPIC, by the way."
3,A tale of greed and incompetence,I found the book very interesting and could not put it down till it was finished.It focussed more on the personalities of the characters involved rather than the depth of their crimes.
4,"Not perfect, and I enjoyed it!","If you're one of those people who can't stand illogical behavior from people in books, ""Runaway Heart"" isn't for you. Despite knowing their cell phone conversations are being tracked, they use their cell phones. When on the run from nefarious and omnipotent government forces, they check into hotels under their own names. If it takes an act of stupidity to move the plot along (""They can't find us if we don't do X and Y, and if they can't find us the premise of the book falls apart, so let's do X and Y!""), Mr. Cannell will go for it.That said, this was an entertaining and enjoyable read. The good guys are likable, the bad guys are thoroughly despicable, and if you focus on just the ride and not the details, it keeps you engaged. Reminded me a lot of Dean Koontz, actually."
1,Colors?,"Had I known there was no color key with this calendar I would not have purchased it--very cute patterns but essentially useless without the key. Particularly for us older stitchers who have trouble distinguishing slight variations in color, this is merely an exercise in frustration. When I contacted the company, they suggested I use my own color choices, which is not why I buy patterns in the first place!"
5,A Must Have for Ghost and History Lovers Alike,"An excellent book about the history and hauntings of the historic Avon Theatre located in Decatur, Illinois! This theater was brought back to life by one of the authors, Skip Huston. If you haven't yet been to the Avon, read the book and then go for a visit. You'll find yourself looking over your shoulder and wondering what visitors you can't see...or maybe you will!!"
2,Disappointing,"Getting started in homicide investigation, and after reading the reviews here, it seemed this was the book for me. Unfortunately this book didn't help much at all. The entire book is in an outline format that just gives bullets on what to do and not to do. It doesn't explain the WHY of any of these things. Without the explainations behind the items, I did not learn anything from this book. I recommend you look elsewhere."
4,import fee,"Thank you for got me the DVD 20 days before your foreseen delivery date, yet I realized that I paid too much as importation tax (10 Euro are really too much for an item whose weight is so low)"
1,They turned gold into garbage,"If they had SIMPLY put each year's award show on a DVD of its own and sold it as a boxed set (which is what I THOUGHT I was buying from producers Time/Life), it would have been great. What they did was take a decade's worth of footage and randomly chop it up into a completely disorganized mess. They provide NO index to the material..they don't even NUMBER each DVD so it's impossible to find anything you like. Whoever edited and designed this was a tasteless IDIOT."
