1,Disjointed and melodramatic,"This book had all of the elements of a great story. Unfortunately, the author didn't deliver a great story. The writing was clumsy and disjointed, the dialogue was melodramatic and unbelievable, the characters were not very likable, and the ending was disappointing."
1,Excessive enlightenment,"The tale was worth telling, I suppose, though focusing on the plot line appeared to be challenging for the author. I found myself wishing for a tighter prose. So much enlightenment, so many distractions, soo0000000 many details!"
3,A bit slow moving,"Overall, I cant really recommend this book but I will say that improves over the second half. Once the writer finished developing the characters and the story of her past life, it started to emerge to a more interesting book and I found finishing the book during the second half to be much easier. My suggestion advice: push on, it will get interesting after a while. I found this book tough to read. It took me several tries to get far enough into it that I was motivated to keep going."
1,PAINFULLY BORING! CAN'T FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH....,"OKAY AMAZON, YOU DIDN'T OFFER THE OPTION OF NEGATIVE STAR RATING. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ! I'M 3/4 OF THE WAY THROUGH AND I JUST DON'T THINK I CAN PULL IT OFF! IF YOU LIKED THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, YOU'LL LOVE THIS!"
4,Better than I expected....,"I must admit-- I'm trying not to read Oprah books. It's not that I have issues with her selections...I just wonder what the true motives are. Anyway. I picked up While I Was Gone because I wanted some light summer reading. I was pleasantly surprised. I found myself finding every excuse to just relax and read. I wanted to find out what would happen to Jo, and if she would discover the truth behind Dana's murder. I must admit, I was a little disappointed with the ending, but all in all, it was an enjoyable read."
4,Predictable yet inconsistent,"Sue Miller's trip to communal living brought back the late sixties and the familiar inhabitants of that time well. Her writing is personal and has a wistful tone I admire. However, I found flaws in the story. To me, the killer stood out by a mile. His reappearance in the story confirmed his guilt as though a finger had been pointed at him. But the strongest weakness in the narrative comes from the protagonist herself. As secretive and enigmatic as she is throughout the book, she suddenly develops an inability to lie in order to protect her spouse from a painful truth at a crucial moment. This felt contrived. Still, the book and its inhabitants have stayed with me long after I finished the novel. To me, this alone is a reason to recommend the book."
3,A good read with some twists,This book was entertaining although not as good as I had hoped. It had interesting aspects and some twists and turns along the way but ultimately it wasn't a book that I was running home to read each day. I recommend it as a casual read with no big expectations.
5,Audiobook review,"I enjoy listening to audiobooks while I drive and oftentimes (unless read by the author), I find the reader's voice irritating. This reader (Blair Brown) was very good and easy to listen to. Moreover, the story was wonderful.Beyond this, While You Were Gone is also a morality tale about telling and secrets and forgiveness. Miller subtly draws in the ethical conflicts with Jo's husband Daniel, a minister, as the foil.While You Were Gone gave me a rich new outlook on long-time relationships and family shaping them. This is my first Sue Miller and I will definitely read more."
4,A good read,"This novel is very well written. The protagonist, Jo, seems to have everything in life: a loving husband, beautiful children, a good job..... Yet, she doesn't seem happy. This book takes us through a time in her past that is revisited when she runs into an old roommate. A time of her life that she has tried to leave behind and not deal with. Jo doesn't even confide in her husband who is a minister, and at times he seems ""too good to be true"".It is a book of self-revelation. A journey for Jo that we, as the reader, are propelled into. This was one of those books that I found hard to put down."
4,Engrossing - but back cover gave away ending,"This was the first book I read over the summer and it was a great one to begin with. It was not as light and fluffy as the rest of my self-made summer reading list, but just as quick and easy-to-read. I loved the author's writing style and eloquent use of language and the way she glides back and forth between the present and past. Although I figured out the ""mystery"" well before I was probably supposed to, I think she did a good job of suspense and foreshadowing. In fact, had it not been for the review on the back cover from the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, I probably would not have figured it out ahead of time. I recommend to anyone who purchases this book to resist reading that review!"
4,A very good read -- well worth your time!,I thought this was a very well-written and intriguing book. I personally have found most of Oprah's other book choices to be very depressing. This one was not. It was more thought provoking. I enjoyed it so much I am thinking of getting it as gifts for others.
3,Made for TV Movie Screenplay,"Lifetime should option it, which is not to say that it was all bad. There are a lot of moving parts in this story, but the best writing is dedicated to the more mundane aspects of Jo's life and her feelings about them (i.e., the anxiety she felt about whether or not to have an affair despite her happy marraige).Best of all, Daniel's sermon about death and memory was perfect and worth the read if for it alone. It has been highlighted for inevitable future reference when I'm certain it will provide emotional comfort."
4,Sue Miller Never Disappoints,"I got this book only because Sue Miller is the author. I hadabsolutely no idea what it was about, didn't even read the book flaps. I just plunged in expecting Miller's talent would shine through. I was NOT disppointed. She has such a way with being able to create an unusual but entirely believable situation and present it entirely from a woman's point of view. And not a sappy woman either. But strong and individualistic. Miller never breaks away to give the husband's or the daughter's viewpoint. It stays focused right on the main character, as painful as that may be. I could SEE this woman, and her home and her life and I could FEEL and identify with her every breath and emotion. An unsettling but fascinating read."
5,A great read,"It surpasses THE GOOD MOTHER, FAMILY PICTURES and, especially, FOR LOVE, by the same author, with skillful storytelling and emotional impact."
3,Starts off interesting but doesn't pack a punch,I enjoy Sue Miller very much and I enjoyed the majority of this book but the ending just seemed to fizzle out. I don't know that I particularly like the main character. Perhaps that is because Sue Miller did a good job as portraying her as this aloof person. I could go on and on but suffice it to say that I was disappointed with the ending.
2,Why Don't You Stay Gone,"I won't say that I utterly hated the book. I think Miller is a talented writer. She brings certain psychological nuances to consciousness. The character of Dana was very strong, and the symbolism in actions by her family members was an artistic treat. However, I felt like the author was simply celebrating mediocraty. For her to write a book about the fantasies and unsettling of a person bent for some excitement and then coupling it with the unlikely ""passionate murder"" was just too fantastic for me. Murder is overdone, and I thought that part was a big yawn. Her simple life was boring and led the reader to absolutely nothing to ask of him or herself."
2,did not fit,"Did not fit my 2012 toyota double cab. They work, but over hyped for the price. The back of the mats ride up. Hopefully, the front mats from the same company fits. I'm supposed to receive them shortly."
2,WARNING: IT IS NOT SILK,"I ordered this blouse on amazon. I loved tehe design and the color. But when I received it, I got so disapointed. It wasn't silk, as it was described on amazon. It is 100 polyester, not comfy on skin, and only lining are silk or so. Be aware."
4,Massive short story collection,"Reading through this massive collection of short stories is almost a daunting task. With more than 500 pages and print that would never be called large, it took me a ridiculously long time to complete. Usually, I would go through and make a comment about each of the stories, but there were much too many for that. Also, frankly, I don't remember a darn thing about the first few of them. Actually, scanning through the table of contents, I don't remember anything about most of them. I can say that I was not bored reading this book, it was just interminably long. I would say you might need to be in the right mood to tackle this. I've sort of OD'd on science fiction short stories lately. Maybe it's time for something different. (My apologies for making this review more about me than about the book.)"
2,Disjointed rock album,"For four years, Beavis and Butt-head was a very popular show on MTV. But this album inspired by that show left me disappointed. Most of the rock bands on here come out with very disjointed and uninteresting songs. Some of their worst efforts in their careers and they don't really rock that well. Even Megadeth's song sounds so self-deprecating in some cases. Sir Mix-A-Lot's redo of his song comes off as lame. And the Beavis and Butt-head number with Cher sounds silly and out of place. Come To Butt-head sounds corny. Only the Run-DMC song Bounce, and Aerosmith's rocking Deuces are Wild stand out of this mess. The others sound like they were left on the cutting room floors in studios and that's not good. Save your money on this sorry mess and buy something else!"
5,Very Nice! Great Price!,It was a much nicer watch than I expected for the price. Service from the seller was exceptional. Everything went without a hitch.
4,Best memory book I've read so far,"Mr. Higbee gives a very no-frills view of how to improve your memory and learn more efficiently and effectively. He also provides great instruction on the best and most commonly used mnemonic systems.I personally used the techniques taught to obtain my Certified Insurance Counselor designation, which requires you to pass five different classes. Each class entails three full days of classroom and a very rigorous essay-question-only exam at the end. I would never have gotten through it without the strategies taught in this book.I highly recommend."
3,"Practice, Practice, Practice",Like all memory technques the authors stress association for memory improvement which is a good exercise to help remember things. In order for it to be effective it has to be practiced which can become a chore and why most people fail because they don't do it. I think Kevin Trudeau may have a more simple and effective method which is along the same lines as these authors. I know some people may have unfavorably thoughts about Trudeau but I thought his memory courses were good and helped me some. And you can get them at your local library as you can with this book. I chose to buy this book it because I want it handy as reference material.
2,highly over rated !!,"I have dozens of memory books in my shelf. I had been eyeing this book for sometime on the site but somehow didn't have a good feeling about it. But impressed by the reviews written here, i finally decided to add this book to my array. But i was very disappointed.This book is more of a research work. The author gives account of his ardous and meticulous research carried out in the field of memeory. But this book doesn't adequately teach a layman the application of various tools of memory in detail. The book is full of stuff like experiments conducted by the author on students, etc. etc.Moreover, this book is too wordy. There are some excellent and far better books in market which concentrate more on the practical aspects of memeory techiniques rather than laying too much stress on research.Buy this only if you need research information on memeory. Harry Lorayne is the king of memeory. Try books written by him."
5,Fun for all ages,My mother gave me this game as a gift. My friends and I are addicted. This game really gets you thinking.
5,Made In Chicago-The Buckinghams,I found this album as before a wonderful experience by a very talented group of musicians. The music was powerful no matter what was the next track it had something for everyone to sing along with.
2,Huge and heavy,"These things are like goggles. They cover half my face and I don't have a small face. I wouldn't mind this, except this also means they're crazy heavy. The first time I put on my glasses with these things clipped on, my glasses fell right off. Luckily, I caught them before they hit the ground. I also don't notice any significant reduction in glare, and the pair I ordered came heavily smudged with fingerprints. I think I got someone's hand-me-downs."
3,They're OK but....,"These clip ons really do help with glare and there is definitely a reduction in eye strain at the end of the day. They will do until I get my new computer eyeglass prescription, which I will have tinted in a similar color. I should mention that the little screws come off very easily where the clip on part attaches to the lens. I've had my clipons less than a month and already one is missing. They do work as advertised - the assembly quality just isn't that great - but hey it's less than $20 so they'll be fine as an interim solution."
4,Do cut glare,"I have trouble with my eyes after using the computer for a few hours, these glassesdo cut the glare and make the eyes much more comfortable.I now use them all the time. I had to have the clip on's and they have the sameshortcomings of any clip on but overall they work.I like them."
1,Isn't there a minus sign for a rating?,"I bought this VCR...through Amazon.com....There is not an extended warranty offered. My first mistake. The VCR worked for about 3 weeks. When it worked, it was great. I loved everything about it. All of a sudden no picture, just audio. I went to the Toshiba site and found a repair shop that Toshiba recommends. To make a long story short, this is the 3rd time it's been in the repair shop. They told me they replaced the board. Sounds bad. The repair shop STILL has it from the 3rd trip in March of this year. Now I'm back waiting with Toshiba to get a new VCR. The repair shop tried to pawn a used one off on me. Toshiba was very nice at first, now I'm left hanging by the manufacturer. I have an older Toshiba that still works great. That's why I bought another Toshiba.This VCR was a lemon for me. I read the customer reviews, most weren't good, but I purchased anyways.Even more reason to read the reviews.Save your money and possible headaches on this one folks."
4,North Africa,"Notable chiefly for ""Thé à la menthe"", an instrumental piece featured in OCEANS 12, this collection nonetheless is a solid and deeply pleasing collection of dance-y, trance-y North African music."
4,127 useful pages,"As a professional in the facade industry (which commonly relies on aluminium components), I found the book to be full of interesting commentary about working with aluminium. Since the curtain wall industry rarely relies on welding as a means to fasten aluminium, this book was a welcomed trip into alternative methods of working.The book is practical, and is based on ""shop experience"". Accordingly, I would highly recommend it for engineers and designers. It's very quick and simple to read, yet I keep a copy of it on my desk to use as a constant source of reference."
3,So-so,"Some of the content of the book is fascinating. I enjoyed when he discussed operational details, but they seemed few and far between. As other reviews have said, the book seems focused on house hunting and the like. I also found his writing style to be a bit up and down. It almost reads like a first draft, with a strange flow.I would recommend the book for anyone who is interested in the subject because there is not that much available that describes life inside the Agency. That being said, it is by no means a great read."
4,Great Film - Awful Subtitles,"Whoever wrote the subtitles for the DVD release of these Basil Rathbone - Sherlock Holmes films should be drawn and quartered. At one point in this film, Holmes tells Moriarty that he has great respect for him, ""but only as a knave."" The subtitle gives the line as ""but only as a maid."" At one point ""Oxford Circus"" becomes ""Oxford Service"" and ""gifted cracksman"" becomes ""gifted cracksman."" There are far too many similar blunders. But the films are great, and this one is particularly good."
2,"Quality Candy, Deceptive Product Picture","I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a friend that loves Kit-Kat bars. The bars were good but they did not come in the retail packaging as pictured, which was largely disappointing. Instead they came packaged loosely with popcorn material in an unmarked cardboard box."
3,Just OK,"Item works as a straight line laser, but doesn't work at all for locating wall studs. Not impressed at all."
1,Disappointed in quality,"I have been really disappointed in the quality of this toy. When I first gave it to my grandson for Christmas, some of the wood was split and I had to order a replacement. I recently visited him and found that the chalk board side doesn't have enough tooth to hold chalk. It just slips around hardly making a mark. Great idea but bad execution."
3,I have had the same problems with this as others,"As soon as I took it out of the plastic and picked it up, the easel fell apart. I was so upset because I was looking forward to opening this item and immediately surprising my child with some quality time and activity.This is poorly put together, but once you use some glue and let it sit for while to dry it should be fine. My child absolutely loves the easel. Learning ABC's and numbers(education), drawing pictures(creativity), and playing connect the dots with straight lines(dexterity) all keep a child occupied, happy and more importantly interested.Great idea. Poorly built product that can be fixed with some epoxy. I would have given 5 stars if it didn't immediately fall apart right out of the original packaging."
4,Horror Classic,"I saw this movie on late night TV when I was around eight years old. I loved it then and I love it now.I don't know what kind of effects they used on the womans voice (post decapitation) but it still creeps me out when ever she speaks.I would have given it three stars for the battling voluptuous strippers scene alone. But all in all it's a great low budjet horror film. I still find the talking head to be quite profound in her enlightened view of the world (once again, post decapitation)."
1,I'm confused,"If the product is ""Brain That Wouldn't Die/Amazin"" why is there a cover for ""Chained Heat 3: Hell Mountain""?Anyway, as for the movie ""Brain That Wouldn't Die,"" it's not even a particularly great MST3K episode (well, it's decent), let alone movie.Never saw Amazin."
4,Really Scary,"I never saw this one as a kid. I'm not sure how I missed it, but I'm glad I did. It's scary as hell. The photography quality is awfull, the acting is what you would expect, but it comes across as a cross between a film noir ,an old dracula flick, and the 1930's Blue Angel. Excellent for a dark night."
2,"dumb, but better than ""Manger""","I read ""Cat of a diffrent color"" just to see if ""Cat in the Manger"" was a fluke. It wasn't. ""Different Color"" is better, but still is a bad mystery. It starts with the news that a whacko theatre guy is dead, and Alice goes to his funeral, where she is accosted by another whacko theatre guy. If this sounds cliched, it is. Adamson makes almost everyone invloved with theatre a raving lunatic. The three elderly Russian guys have got to be the worst excuse of villains I've ever seen. There is also a cat at the center of this, and the importance of this cat is ludricous. Read this book only for campiness."
3,"Light on padding, fits 16"" kids BMX bike","A little concerned about the long term quality, but it is a perfect replacement for a kids 16"" bike. Lightly padded, not much there."
2,Plentiful errors,"Too many errors in the book, it can cause more frustration and confusion than it is worth."
5,EXCELLENT *introductory* book,"This book is absolutely perfect for someone who is just beginning their studies for CCNA certification. It introduces and *explains* most of the major concepts on the exam in a very clear and easy to understand manner. As one reviewer has already noted, this text is much more effective in explaining and describing important points than even Sybex's popular book by Lammle. Also, it provides outstanding tips on what types of questions are destined to be on the exam and what pitfalls to look out for. It is very well written and makes an otherwise somewhat dry subject rather interesting :) After you read this book, you must study either the Sybex book (by Lammle) or Cisco Press' certification guide. <Cisco's book is better at explaining the ""why"" in addition to the ""how""...Sybex is typically just the ""how"">"
3,Review for Dummies,"I have not had the opportunity to use this textbook as of yet, but I have seen of it, it looks Very Good."
3,CCNA for dummies..,"This is a good study guide, it quickly glances over the topics and gives you tons of highlights, buzzwords, charts and tables. I would not use this as a primary source as the Sybex book is much better in terms of depth, but if your just brushing up or need another poit of view I would recommend this book. Also the tests are helpful from the CD because you can customize it. T My only one complaint on this book is the part on ip addressing and subnetting, it was a little difficult and the wording made it tricky to figure out. This was a pretty hard topic to figure out and this book did not make it much easier, but overall a good book and a good aid, not a main source of info though. Jerry."
4,Good basic info on the CCNA exam.,"Good basic info on Cisco networking in general and the CCNA exam in particular. ""Cisco IOS for IP Routing"" by Andrew Colton (ISBN 0972286209) would take you much further in understanding the IP routing protocols. Check out books by Jeff Doyle and Radia Perlman as well. Though not if you are a complete beginner to Cisco."
2,Disapointing,"I bought this video as I am a Michael Biehn fan. He is superb in his role, but was gutted when he is only in the long opening sequence. The film itself does have messages in it, mainly about forgiveness and healing. Quite violent, and with average performances from Peterson and Rossi. The great Paul Winfield is great, but again, only in one scene. The film has a great cast, but some what wasted."
1,Not a true modelling manual,"This book claims to focus solely on WWII dioramas. Except for period buildings, and staging the scenes with WWII figures and paraphernalia, some very basic diorama ideas on detailing etc can be gleaned from this offering. The quality of the figures is very poor. I note the very incisive comments by the Hong Kong reviewer on the quality of the car model. Why only two dioramas are presented is another matter, but the whole book feels incomplete and shoddy to me."
5,Much better than the first DVD!,"I really liked the first DVD, but it has some episodes that I like better than others. When I bought Volume 2, I thought that these might be shows that were not funny enough to make it to Volume 1. I was wrong - this DVD is MUCH funnier! I love every episode - first rate Dame Edna."
5,Perfect Fit and Easy to See,I am vision impaired and needed a sight that stands out better than the white bead on my Mossberg 9200 National Wild Turkey Federation Edition.I removed the stock white bead fom the vent rib and screwed this one in and it lined up perfectly when tight.Removed it and added some blue locktight and now I have a sight I can see! Very happy with this purchase; hope it holds up.
2,"Threads in too deep, doesn't line up...","It seems that a spacer, washer, etc. should be included with this product. Both to get the sight parallel with the barrel, also to prevent the threads from protruding inside the barrel. Also the green material is NOT as bright as depicted in the manufacturer photos. Either the one I received is defective, or the material they use simply isn't as good as others on the market. I simply cannot use it."
4,Good Joy,I love the Hallmark Christmas music series. I have enjoyed the cassette for years and am now glad to have the cd for my collection.
1,For this price? Its insulting.,"My wife picked this up for about $58. The vest is made out of the flimsiest, cheapest material ever. Since it has ""Diego"" on it, I expect that I'm going to get charged more than the item is worth, but this is really outrageous. For the price, they ought to at least make some kind of an effort. How about making it out of canvas or something? This vest is on par with those cheap halloween costumes you can pick up at the last minute at the drugstore. The accessories it comes with are equally cheap. If I'd paid 1/5 the price, I'd still feel like I paid too much, but I'd say to myself, ""its a throwaway item, what the hell."""
2,It looks like a magazine!!,"What's with all the advertisement strewn all over the 3rd edition? I have the 2nd ed. and wanted to upgrade to the new one, but found so many obnoxious magazine-style full-page ads that it looked like a copy of Cosmo, and put it right back on the shelf. They should discount the price with all that ad revenue. No complaints about the 2nd edition- I think I'll stick with it."
1,Disappointed,"In her summary, Margaret Starbird complains that other theories on the Tarot are ""...purely speculative and not supported with hard evidence...."" This could be the subtitle to her own book. She has written an interesting, even intriguing, thesis and this work is her first chapter, but where is the rest of the book that supports her thesis? I've been a student of Tarot through the BOTA system for 22 years and am engrossed/obsessed with the Holy Grail theories, ala ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail."" I was hoping for insight on the two issues, but found only unsubstantiated theory here."
4,it was good,I thought that the book was a great book. At first I had some hesitation about whether or not I would like this book.but after a while it turned out to be okay.It confuses me when beverly is goin around tellin all these boys that she likes him that is one of the reasons i didnt like it
1,Only one Torx Bit,"The image shows 12 torx bits in a holder. This is very misleading. You will only receive 1 T40 without the holder. The single T40 is of good quality, but who would pay $9.57 for one torx bit?"
1,Verbose Ad Nauseum,"I appear to be in the minority with my dislike of the book Spock's World by Diane Duane. I have read other Duane Star Trek novels and suffice it to say this author gives you three pages of irrelevance to one page story. I like a little background as mauch as any reader, but Duane does so excessively to the point that she is the literary equivalent of a person who likes to hear the sound of their own voice. Descriptive to the point that you can't see the forest for the trees."
1,bad,"This books dwells too much on patterns, in effect the vocabulary is minimal. Amharic is not transcribed, Italian is not marked for stress. I'll recomend Lonely Planet - may not be perfect, but certainly it's better."
2,Too much advertising and too expensive! Better stay away...,"I bought also Vol 2 and 3. Only Vol. 1 is (if at all) necessary. For this piece of information, a price of 50$ is justified at most. For example: All the time is said ""Keep your losses small"", without to quantify HOW small. (what a wisdom!) Important is only your win/loss ratio and your win probability. If you have a win probability of 80% then one can have easily a win/loss ratio of 0.5 ( this meas BIG losses compared to the wins ) and the system is nevertheless profitable. If you are a serious trader better stay away from discretion..."
1,My son had an absolute blast (taking it apart),"Just look at those beautiful and colorful knobs! The easel is incredibly sturdy (if the child doesn't try to take it apart). But no matter how hard you tighten those colorful knobs, a little boy with mechanical aptitude will be able to take them off. They were too much for my son to resist, so he basically took the thing apart several times. One time it almost came crashing down upon him. You'd think he'd learn! But I think the thrill of taking it apart far exceeded the risk of having it crash down on him. So if you have a child that you think can resist dismantling this ""toy"", by all means buy it. My son is 3. Maybe the age recommendation should be 4+ or 5+."
4,My daughter loves it!,My daughter is really enjoying her new Easel. She is 7 and is average height and this easel fits her just right on the tallest setting. It is also great for her younger brothers who are a bit shorter. I like that you can adjust the height and grow with it. It is nice and sturdy and you can fold it up when you need extra room. My only complaint is the chalk board surface is not a real chalk board. You can write on it but it isn't the right texture. I think I will just take it off and spray it with some chalk board paint that you buy in the paint section at Walmart and reattach it.
4,She loves it!,We bought this easel for my granddaughter's third birthday. She loved it. On one side there is a chalk board and on the other an area for painting. She is now six and she has enjoyed it for three years. Soon her little brother will be able to use it too.
4,"Perfect toy, except for the chalkboard","Our 2 year old loves this toy. He loves the dry erase marker side and loves to paint. It is everything they said it is and Melissa and Doug toys are some of the best on the market. The only knock I have with the product is the chalk board isn't very good. It doesn't show up well, erase well or generally speaking, work well like a chalkboard should. It seems they skimped a bit on that piece of the product.That being said, it is a very good product and our little guy loves it when we pull the paints and markers out for him to play. Get the additional accessory kit too. It is worth it."
4,great easel,"it was easy to put together (though I should have done this before my niece opened her present wondering what was in the box!!). It has been used well so far, and even the adults wanted a turn. Looks good, is functional, and practical. It was nice getting the companion set to start it off with all the right fitting attachments too."
1,Flimsy,"My son has had this for nearly 3 years. The legs bowed and cracked within the first month that he got it. The dowel that holds the roll of paper has gone missing and should be attached better. The screws are constantly coming loose and we eventually got tired of reattaching the support arms; they have been sitting on my bookshelf for over a year. Lastly, no matter how much we try to ""cure"" the chalkboard it is worthless. Chalk barely shows up at all. We will likely attach the dry erase board to the wall soon and trash the rest of it."
5,Melissa and Doug deluxe easel,We bought this easel and the accessories for our granddaughter's third birthday. she loves it. It was easy to assemble. My husband did it himself which is amazing! It is attractive and sturdy and folds easily for storage. A winner.
5,really great easel,"first, there is NO PROBLEM with the chalkboard. the critical review about the chalkboard was dated 2007 and clearly the company has made changes, because right out of the box the chalkboard was fabulous.second, the easel was pretty easy to set up.third, i appreciate the ability to set the boards at different heights. but note: if you have a little toddler (mine is 19mos) it will take some time before they can reach the upper half of the boards even at the lowest setting. still, not a big deal.so far, my daughter is really enjoying it. we bought the easel, companion pack, smock, and extra paper. a toddler's delight!**my only negative critique is that the paint isn't very washable (i have had to water it down a little and add some liquid dish soap to the paint to ameliorate this problem)."
5,Fun Easel,"Gave to my 3 year old son for bday. He loves the chalkboard and dry erase board and plays with it everyday. Almost takes the place of him drawing on the walls, but it's a great outlet for any color crazy child! I didn't realize it didn't come with any supplies, so buyer beware that you will need to purchase the paper roll and accessories separately. Also doesn't fold, so be prepared for it to take up space. Definitely recommend this fun easel."
4,bought for 2 year old,"I like the adjustable sizing on this easel. Right now it is at the lowest height, but it will grow with my son. It is very sturdy overall, although I had to stop him from trying to sit on the paint and crayon holders. One clip broke when he pulled on it too hard."
4,Only complaint: wipeboard difficult to erase,I am very glad I got this for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves it. It is just the right size but has room for her to grow. (the drawing surfaces can be adjusted for height.)It is well-made and sturdy. The trays are roomy and the chalkboard works perfectly if you rub it with a piece of chalk before the first use. My only complaint is that the dry-erase board is somewhat difficult to erase. We solved the problem by filling a small spray bottle with rubbing alchohol and spraying that on before erasing. My daughter was just disappointed to find that she cannot erase it herself.Otherwise I am totally happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone with young children who love to draw.
5,easel,"My 6yr old son loves it, exactly what I wanted. Its sturdy, easy to clean both sides. We love the roll of paper, very convenant."
4,Looks good and the kids love it,"This is a great easel and the boys do enjoy it. We paint, use the dry erase board, color. The blackboard isn't the best, but for the money, this is a great product."
1,"Falls a part constantly, choking hazard","This Easel falls a part constantly. The little red/green/blue/yellow knobs are very easy for a child of any age to twist and undo the screw. Even when no one touches the knobs, they seem to work themselves loose frequently. I am unsure why Melissa and Doug even constructed this product like this. Sadly, I highly do not recommend this product. It looks nice. But that is where it ends."
2,Missing Items,I ordered this easel for my grandson for Christmas. When it was opened it was missing the paper and the paints. Both items are shown on the package. It wasn't much fun when the important parts were missing.
3,Damaged item,"We received the Melissa & Doug standing Easel but the chalk board was chipped and damaged. After paying that price,i think it is only fair to ask for a replacement chalk board. Pls reply asap.Thanks!"
4,Great Easel,"I think this is the best easel out there right now, esp. for the price! I like the textured chalk board, it really cuts down on the chalk dust."
4,Great Easel,This easel is awesome. I don't know why they have to cost $[...] when this one is inexpensive and great quality. My kids love it and it keeps the mess all in one place. Couldn't be happier with this product and it was easy to put together.
2,Not worth the price,"Poor quality. Received with extremely warped wooden legs. Bottom holes for the chalkboard did not line up and I had to drill new holes. The dry erase board must be of a low quality because leaving a mark on it for more than 2 minutes requires a cleaning solution and a scrubber to erase. Very poor quality for the price, will be sending this back and buying something else. Would not recommend to buy any of this product line."
5,Nice Easel,This was a very nice gift to my daughter. It was very nice and sturdy! Easy to put together too!
1,Melissa & Doug 2008 Upgraded Easel,"We purchased the ""new"" and ""improved"" M & D Easel. What a disappointment to say the LEAST. I am excellent at putting things together, but this product was ridiculous. The directions were unclear, but I continued, determined to put it together for my child for Xmas.What I found was some of the screws would not properly screw into place. One hole was just in the wrong spot and to top it off, part of the easel was damaged.I suggest instead of taking a ""short cut"", just go and support a local store in your area and buy an easel that is already put together!!This was not worth it. I really wanted it to be!I had read reviews of the M & D Easel and it was mixed. Obviously, the product is not consistent or dependable, but I recklessly ignored them, thinking I would come out OK. But alas, I did not!If I can be helpful to one person... Don' buy this product!!"
3,deluxe?,"I like the easle, but it didnt come with anything. & it doesnt tell u u need 2 purchase, the chalk, eraser, markers, paper, etcThat should be included with the easle...esp if it is deluxe"
4,art,"This product is a must have. I just bought it for Christmas so my children haven't had the opp. to play with it yet, but we bought it b/c friends of ours have it. My children love going to there friends house, just so they can paint."
4,This is a great toy but it is not magnetic,The only things I found wrong is since it isn't magnetic none of their letters can be used with it and also unless you use real dry erase markers it's not too easy to clean. Dry erase markers aren't really for kids so i use a wet rag. Can be a bit messy but overall this is a great product.
3,Melissa and Doug Easel,"Product seems to be fairly well constructed and easy to put together. Recommendations would be to include a starter set of markers, chalk, erasers and paper. Could also use rubber bottoms on the legs to prevent scratching on wood floors. Granddaughter seems to enjoy it. Just wish she could have played with it out of the box."
5,great for artists and the whole family,"My 3 girls use the easel every day. They use every bit of it mostly fordrawing and painting. But, my youngest uses the chalkboard to put the dinnermenu on it. I have used the whiteboard to show math problems or spell words.A great addition to our house full of toys!"
4,Nice easel - but only 23 inches wide,"After putting the easel together I felt it wasn't as wide as I was hoping/expecting. I actually had to pull out the measuring tape. It says that the width is 26 inches long but it is only 23. The easel is very nice and sturdy. I have 3 boys 2, 4 & 6 and they all love it. I really want and need a large easel. Disappointed the easel width was shorter than the dimension specified."
2,Cute but not sturdy,"The raw unfinished wood was a splintery disappointment, and the legs are wobbly and extremely thin. It lasted about two weeks before my two-year olds pushed it over and the wood snapped in a long, jagged crack that will be almost impossible to repair. I freely admit my kids should not have been playing under it, but if severely underweight toddlers can knock it over with enough mojo to break and ruin it, then maybe it could stand to be better-made. I mean, if anything is specifically made for kids of this age, then I think it should be made to withstand their creative brands of torture. Very, very disappointed. Also the blackboard was chipped when it arrived. I was going to ask them to replace it but no point now -- the easel is ruined. Spend less on one they can destroy without you getting upset and/or a plastic one."
3,"good item, but came deffective","I bought this easel for my 2-year old for Christmas. While putting it together, we had noticed that one of the legs was cracked along the grain of the wood. Overall, the item is a little flimsy. I called the 800 number on the package and will see how they handle the problem. Overall, it is a good item if it were made of better quality materials."
4,Great for my 4 year old,"The product is sturdy and exactly what we were looking for. However, when you try to adjust it to the tallest height setting, the colored knobs don't fit the way they are supposed to. Also, the ""blackboard"" is green and pretty cheap in quality."
2,Chalk board,The chalk board does not have a good writing service. I even purchased your chalk and and it is very light.You can barely see it.
5,My grandson loves it,Grandson loves it. It has held up well. This is well constructed and should last many years as he grows
4,Wonderful product,"This product is wonderful. It is very sturdy and easy for my 3-year-old to use. I throw down a drop cloth, put an apron on him and let him get in touch with his creative, artistic side! My only issue. . . no paper comes with it! When we received this for my son's birthday, we realized after putting it together that we had to tape regular paper to it. I quickly ordered the easel paper rolls and we were fine, but just be aware that your best bet to get your child started right away is to invest in the easel companion when you buy this."
3,Quality was better a couple fo years ago,"I bought the M&D Deluxe easel for my nephew two years ago and the quality was much better. Chalkboard and Dry Erase borders were hard wood, now they are pressed board. But what is really disappointing is that the dry erase board is NOT magnetic. I bought the new one for my daughter and I now have to return the set of magnets I purchased. The easel is an invaluable learning & play tool, but the magnetic board was an important feature of the older easel."
1,Not worth the hassle,We bought this as a present for my daughter for Christmas. When we went to put it together Christmas Eve it was missing a leg. I immediately went online and scheduled a replacement with Amazon and it was handled wonderfully. We recieved the replacement a few days later but the replacement was missing the screws. I didn't want to return the second one to Amazon to get another one missing parts so I called up Melissa and Doug. It has been nearly three weeks and I still haven't recieved the screws to put this thing together. I am about to return it and never buy another Melissa and Doug product again. Their customer service rep was very rude and kept trying to talk over me to tell me I had put it together wrong. How could I put it together wrong without screws?
5,Miracle product!,"I bought this silver polish, hoping it would save my custom silver ball chain that had become badly tarnished. A note to other customers, or just people in general, wearing silver in the shower, and using anti dandruff shampoo (which often has a high sulfur content), will ruin your jewelry! Fortunately, I found this product, and was able to restore my chain and pendants to their original luster. I think they might even look better now, than when I first got them! This product really performs! Highly recommended!"
5,It's the best.,This is the best silver polish I ever used. No need to scrub to get silver to shine. I strongly recommend this product.
5,This is a fun and encouraging video,"I have enjoyed ""Walk your belly flat"" with Leslie. She is energetic and full of what is good for you, without being patronizing. I never feel bad because I can't keep up with her... which encourages me to use the video and increase my capability each time. I haven't walked my belly flat...YET! But I will. A very satisfied consumer."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"This book is the ultimate one trick pony. If the point of this book is to be an indictment of the bureaucracy and soul crushing nature of working at the post office, then, yeah, that's true. But it's not exactly a mystery as I'm sure we've all heard of ""going postal."" Maybe this book was the first to posit this theory that working at a post office is no good, I haven't really checked the history of that phenomenon. Nonetheless, the action is repetitive and the depiction of the protagonist is incredibly self-serving to the so-called nth degree. Basically, my beef is that I finished the book, asked myself ""that's it?"", and walked away with no greater understanding of anything. Oh yeah, I guess I thought working at the post office sucks, but, in actuality, it REALLY sucks."
2,Disappointment,"After reading the reviews on this site, I ordered this book. I had expected the book to be keeping me laughing and yet, I don't think I laughed... ever. The tale seemed centered around a character who worked at the post office for no apparent reason and just fed his cravings for sex. The story was an easy read, I finished it in roughly two sittings but I wasn't satisfied with the tale. It didn't seem to have any direction and fell flat on the comedy front. Ultimately, I would only recommend it if you can't find anything else to read and are looking for a quick distraction."
4,Raising working class banality to new heights!,"This book was hysterical! One of the best aspects of it is the author's completely unabashed HONESTY. I think it's quite easy to write an interesting book about Nazi Germany, slavery, mythical beasts, or even love. These are poignant and fascinating subjects in and of themselves. But to write a book about being a ....., drunk who works at a Post Office part time AND make it engaging, entertaining, and downright funny...THAT, in my opinion, is great writing!"
4,Not so sure Bukowski,"It is my least favorite work. As someone said: ""Only mediocr is at is best all the time"". Just like some of his poems. Factotum is better, but read it only BEFORE the Ham. You will get more interested into the Chinasky character after the Factotum."
5,brush up your shakespeare--it's fun!,"This cd is a great way for families to make good use of downtime spent in cars. It combines biographical detail (kids will be fascinated by such everyday Elizabethan images as traitors' heads on spikes on London's Tower Bridge) with fascinating literary and cultural analysis (rap-weary parents will be intellectually intrigued). Quotations from premier academic authorities are interspersed with appropriate period music and short excerpts from the Bard himself. It flows like an NPR report, and you may find yourself sitting in the car to finish it even after you've reached your destination!"
1,Very disappointed.....,"I was looking for a sexy date night romantic movie, but this was NOT it. More like your everyday porn without the annoying music and messy face shots. Then it kept stopping so the main characters could talk about what we just saw. Should be titled ""Just Sex"""
2,Didn't look new,"My pruning grass shears did not look new when they came. They had srcatches on the blades. I was not happy to see that. Maybe they would have sent me a replacement, but I was tired to ask and have to ship them back."
5,Great for 70 yr old Arthritic hands ........,Ship'd from AZ - 15th April - arrived today - 20th - Had almost hoped they would come next week as had promised neighbor they would get a 'test ride' around her more than 100 running feet of flowerbed bricks/edgings - Took less than 1.5 hour.The grip is perfect - the cushioned handles are non-slip / blade length excellent - easy lock/unlock and rounded tips for safety - and 2 boot a 10 yr warranty -Ames True Temper True Temper Pruning Solutions Professional Grass Shear #234930Highly rec. over anything else on the market for the Ames' reliability.
2,Not Happy With these Shears,"These shears would not cut through thick grass. We tightened the blades and it helped somewhat, but still did not cut like my old shears. The handles are very soft and padded. The lenghth of the blade is good, but found that I could not get really close to the stone border I was clipping around. I would not purchase these shears again."
3,Thriller with a happy ending!,"A Mormon family living in Salt Lake City, called the Smarts in the film, have their 14 year old daughter Elizabeth abducted in 2002 by a pair of religious zealots. It is the man, played by Tom Everett, who is the real religious pervert and his `wife' demurely accedes to anything he says. Everett inveigles his way into the Smart home by posing as a handyman - which makes it easier for him to take Elizabeth away as she already knows him. The story was written by Nancey Silvers based on a true incident. The girl, played by Amber Marshall, is eventually returned to the family home after nine months. Brian David Mitchell and his wife Wanda Barzee were caught and prosecuted for abduction. A heart-warming story engagingly told."
4,Much better than I expected!,"After reading the reviews I did not have too much hope for this book. After the first couple of chapters I literally put the book down and pretty much gave up. I just could not take the accents! The next day I decided to give in one last shot and boy was I glad I did. The chemistry between James and Aunie sizzles! Although, I do agree that the suspense side was weak, it was still kind of there and the romance made you invest in the story. (and I am not usually a romance only person) Overall, I am very glad that I finished this book and that I now own it."
3,"Useful information, but skip the New Age lingo!","This book has very valuable information, and while I agree that one should stay in touch with their feelings, I dislike the wording used to describe it......""going inside yourself"", ""inner journey"", ""inner balance"", too much New Age mumbo jumbo to just say to stay in touch with your feelings. I personally draw my strenth, guidance and wisdom from God through an abiding relationship with Jesus Christ, not by going ""inside myself""....I do like the analogy of ""popping the hood"" to check in with those feelings, and the actual concept of ""the method"", but don't like the New Age flavor it's written in. I have still taken away useful information by distilling it down to its basic concepts and disregarding the phraseology used to describe it. I wish there were a Christian book written about these concepts. It would be great!"
5,Hits the nail on the head about overeating,"(I read the previous edition.) The information in this book is VERY VERY VERY VERY POWERFUL! Everyone who struggles with weight should read this book! This book is not another diet. It doesn't propose a solution that is that simplistic. This book provides a method for getting to and dealing with the ROOT of why many people overeat (I've known for years that I don't overeat because I'm hungry, but I never had tools to deal with why I do overeat). Besides the specific lessons and techniques, I found the examples from other peoples' experience were very helpful for me to actually recognize what is going on inside me. I think doing the work this book calls for will not only change my weight, but will also make an important improvement in my life. (I'd also suggest this book to anyone dealing with other compulsive/addictive problems.)"
1,Horrible Harmonica,"Awkward, hard to play, faulty holes, tastes bad, pinches mouth. Worst harmonica I have ever had the misfortune of playing. Do not waste your money on this."
3,Not for Baton Rouge area,"I borrowed this book from the local public library, hoping to find some interesting hikes within an hour drive from Baton Rouge, where I live. Unfortunately the offerings within that radius are uncreative and disappointing. The local suggested ""hikes"" are along the nature trails at Bluebonnet swamp and Highland observatory. I wouldn't consider these hikes at all--they are light strolls of at most 15 minutes!"
3,Not like our store bought,"We have nearly the entire collection of Spode Blue Italian Earthenware dishes. We had some plates that became chipped and ordered replacements, however the replacements were significantly lighter in blue shading than the store bought. The seller may have sent us some ""outlet"" items vs. items approved for in-store sales."
5,Keeping Silent keeps your interest!,"This is a terrific first novel from up and coming author Carla Damron, a native of the South Carolina area she writes about. The story starts off slow and drowsy, like a hot, hazy summer day in a small southern town. Slowly but surely, you realize that not everyone's taking it easy, especially the protagonist, social worker Caleb Knowles, whose deaf brother Sam is accused of murdering his deaf fiance Ann visciously and brutally. With its finely drawn characters (including a few you love to hate), the author keeps the plot twists coming deftly and you think you know whodunnit until the last two pages! Ms. Damron has paved the way to the further adventures of Caleb Knowles with a second novel, Spider Blue due out in June 2003. A definite must have for any suspense lover."
4,Fave G4!,"This is my favorite G4 album. Ran across this in a Tower Record store and had to have, when I read Cliff Richard and Robin Gibb, guesting on two of my favorite songs (Miss You Nights & First of May). How awesome is that! And it was! Hearing Robin entering into the foray, still gives me chills (good chills)."
5,Best of Ralna English 3-CD Set,"ADD THESE CDs TO YOUR AUDIO LIBRARY! These 3 CDs by Ralna English, longtime star of ""The Lawrence Welk Show"" on TV are 'wunnerful'! She sings our favorite big band songs from the '30s and '40s...these are the songs my wife and I dance to...plus, I really enjoy listening to the patriotic and inspirational music...I listen to these every day! My advice...Play these CDs in your car or at home and you'll grin all day and be happy..."
3,More Case Studies And Less of Interweaving Framework,"Hi, This book is full of amazing facts and figures.It could as well take the place of the chronicle on the affairs of the world bank. But the major draw back of this work is its lack of clear cut theoretical framework that could weave the whole work into an unitary whole. There are only scattered but orderly examples of the failures of world bank, but not the deep going reasons for such a pathetic performance on the part of the bank. This book could help the researchers on world bank history and its projects, but not a serious reader looking forward for comprehendable reasons underlying the whole phenomenon."
5,Excellent!,"It is the War of 1812 and Elisabet Holder's father has been kidnapped by the British! Since she has no other relatives she has to move to New Orleans from Boston to live with her Aunt. She finds mystery and suspense in her new home... talk of a ghost and treasure! Elisabet really wants to find the treasure so she could buy her father freedom... but soon she finds out that she's not the only one that wants it! This book was easy to read and fun. It's the kind of book you can read at midnight when you can't fall asleep. It keeps your attention. Besides being a cool mystery, it tells a lot about 1814 and pirates and smugglers!"
4,Better Than Miles,"I think the title says it all....Miles was a genius, but not a ""virtuoso"" trumpeter (I should know, I have been playing trumpet for 47 years!). Eddie, on the other hand, is a true master of the trumpet...love his playing!"
1,Cheap Sheets,"This must be the cheapest quality sheets from wamsutta. I love their sheets. but this one is thin, cheap and not comfortable at all... Save your money"
1,Paper thin sheets!!!!,"I bought this sheet set for our guest room. I washed and dried the set and went to make the bed. As I pulled the corners over, the sheet stretched out and didn't go back. I had this saggy, puckered, see-through sheet on the bed. I have a normal queen mattress with a down mattress topper. The fitted sheet fit like a king size. It drooped and hung over the edges. It has no elasticity. A normal nights sleep will probably cause the corners to flip up over the mattress. The material is NOT normal jersey knit, it is more like a really chep, thin, cotton night-shirt. I will probably take them off before I have company. Don't waste your money."
2,Not worth the cheap price,I bought these and after my first use I loved them. I washed them once in cold water and dried them on cool... the cotton pilled up so bad I have had to throw them out. Not a good experience!!!
1,A Boring Mess!,"This book is one of the worst books that I have read on the subject. I think I learned less from reading the book - It is tedious, boring, and pretentious. What a waste of time and money - A must read for those who must know the evolutionary history of a molar. zzzzzzz!"
5,top notch,after looking at a variety of reviews I decided to buy this model. Here's why:1. very powerful motor (800 compared to 400 of other makes)2. with added attachments could be the complete kitchen-do-everything machine3. spout on lid of bowl makes it easy to add while mixing. (I am very clumsy!)4. large capacity bowl with a handle on side (clumsy me again)5. Price: retail was $550.00 but found it on Amazon with a comparative price to my #2 choice (Kitchen Aid)That made the decision for me...Got it at $269.00 and no shipping charges.I'm extremely pleased with my decision.
3,limited capacity,"I've been using this mixer for 2 months, mainly for making bread. The bowl is large enough but the attachments are surprisingly small and extend deep into the bowl. Bread dough almost always climbs up over the guard and wraps around the shaft with any substantial 2-3 loaf recipes. I wish I had gotten the larger model or perhaps the Viking."
4,Good but not perfect,"I've used this mixer for about a month and it does a good job of mixing things together - so why don't I consider it perfect - The mechanism used to raise and lower the arm does NOT work smoothly.There are 2 tracks that it slides on as you raise and lower the arm. There is a ROUGH scraping on these tracks during this motion. If it had been easy to return the product, I might have done so, as I view this as a manufacturing defect. But I decided to live with the flaw as the mixer does work, but it is aggravating each time I raise and lower the arm."
5,Four years old and going strong,"We purchased this mixer four years ago. Believe it or not, we bought it mainly because we wanted one powerful enough and with a large enough bowl to handle double batches of chocolate chip cookies. It has held up very well. My only minor complaint would be that the blade doesn't reach a small circle at the very bottom of the bowl, so you have to be sure to reach down in there with a spatula to mix that batter in. But I've never had a stand mixer that didn't require some bowl scraping, and this is definitely the best one that I've used."
4,scott's war,dramatic w.w.two historical setting-a trial where all the participants are themselves prisoners of war. america's racism is center stage for nazi observers of the u.s. judicial process. excellent pre-trial prep and courtroom scenes.narrator's tendency to rephrase slackens the pace without adding nuance to the plot.
5,Tangled Web Plot - Fast and Fun,"Just hate to pick up a book like this. Missed the gym - read the book. Kept you wondering and wishing. Graphic interactions among the POWs were so real. Discription of camp closely matched my father's recollection - he was the pilot of ""Green Eyes."""
1,Brenda DePuy,My second review today of this shoe. This is the first day I've worn this shoe and my feet are hurting so bad I can hardly walk..... I've worn Easy Spirit shoes for years with no complaints. This is quite possibly the most uncomfortable shoe I've ever had on. I want my money back! These shoes are terrible.
3,Had to return,My shoe size is between 6 and 6 1/2. Size depends on the actual shoe. This 6 1/2 was too large and a size 6 was much more expensive. Had to return them.
5,"""Faade"" is what independent cinema should be. A Great Film!","The characters are highly original and the ending is extremely intense. The subject matter dealt with is a gruesome topic, but they really pulled it off. I highly recommend this film. I can't believe they made it for $14,000! This film redefines the word INDIE."
4,Intense Drama in Real Time - Independent Film,"A very intense study and introspective look at people relating with another under the guise of friendship. When the chips are down, and the emotional veneer is cracked, we find that solace is sought in different ways and selfishness leaves a trail of broken, unfulfilled lives."
2,AVERAGE CD,At least this CD has the theme song. My almost 5 year old nephew seems to like it. The first story briefly tells their origins. The next on track 3 is about the Joker's utility belt.
4,Easy to use & clean - Makes great panini,"I've been using this for two weeks and the panini I'm making are delicious. It's so easy to use that I never hesitate to make panini; all you do is plug it in and wait a few minutes for it to heat up. Clean-up is also easy because of the non-stick surface. My one complaint, and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the handle, which wraps around three sides, is not entirely covered in protective plastic and gets as hot as the grill surface. I keep accidentally hitting the sides with my hands and getting tiny burns. Now, after reading the other reviews, I hope that my panini maker lasts a long time and does not break or mysteriously die. If that should happen, I shall post an update. For now, I give it two thumbs up with a word of caution to guard those thumbs from getting burnt."
1,Where does the grease go?,"The Grill is ok. Good looking. Ok for sandwiches. What about meat? Do a burger and what do you do with the fat? It is a real problem.VillaWare has a similar unit where the grease flows into a drip cup. Very nice.Plus the Krups unit does not have any way to adjust the temperature, the VillaWare does."
1,Piece of Junk,Received at Christmas - dead three weeks later. See where numerous others have had the same experience. How does Krups get away with selling this crap?
1,Faulty product,"Although I enjoyed the few times I used this grill, I had a bad experience when a screw unbolted and the hot lid came off the hinges and nearly burned me. I am in the process of trying to get some resolution from Krups and dont know if they will help me."
2,Didn't last long,This turned us into panini addicts and then left us high and dry when it quit working after about 5 months of using it 2+ times per week. I will be replacing it ASAP with some other type of panini maker.
3,Fantastic appliance but has short life span,"This appliance is fantastic - does a great job and looks good too. However, like the reviewer below, ours died after 1 1/2 years. There is no reason an appliance like this shouldn't last for many years."
5,Orchid Book,Book was bought as gift. They found it interesting and a lot of useful information about growing orchids. The price was right and shipping was also. It arrived in good shape and on time.
4,Lovely!,"I've used this item to make a patio and walkway in my back yard, and it adds to the beauty as well as providing a dry walk when needed. I've worked with concrete, making stepping stones, yard items etc for several years. This is one great idea!"
5,Rocks,My wife and I spent a portion of the afternoon creating part of a new patio area in our yard. We bought two molds so that we could more easily see the lay out of the project. They work great and fit together nicely.
2,Terribly Dense,"The Book of Fathers seemed to have such a fantastic premise, but by the time I was 100 pages into it I had to give up the ghost. The story, about a watch that allows the owner to look backwards and forwards in time, never came together for me.The story is terribly dense, and it never flows in a way that seemed natural. I really had to force myself to turn the pages of this plodding tale. This could very well be due to the fact that it's translated, it may come across much more smoothly in it's native tongue. Both brutal and thoughtful, there was a lot of potential for gripping story telling, but I think the book and I passed like ships in the night."
1,"You might learn COM+ from a Bible, but not from this book","Giving it 1 star cause that's the least. Would have gone lower otherwise.Complete waste of time. The book gives you nothing about COM+ not even close. The author repeats the content in every chapter and keeps reminding about the upcoming content, which doesn't come. He does not cover the behavior of COM+ objects under transactions makes you a complete loser in the COM+ market even after reading the book from cover to cover. I'd say go buy the COM+ from Ted Pattison."
1,Save up some dough and try & find something 2-3x more expensive...,"...because trying to skimp and get a $60 phone is NOT the way to go. I learned the hard way. Bought this for my Dad, and we had it wrapped in the returns box less than a week later. I should have known - right from the start, as it arrived in an Amazon-returns box. Great. The darn thing couldn't go 10 feet away without horrible static; you can't take someone off or put them on speak phone without a horrible shriek; the thing heats up pretty bad; and it forgets to tell time accurately. This all occurred in about 4 days. Best of luck if you decide to purchase...My Dad needs a 2-line phone, so I suppose he'll have to pay about 2-3x. Hopefully it will be worth it..."
1,Faulty Telephone,"After having the phone company come to check out our phone lines we were told we had a bad phone. Line one does not work. Please tell us what process to use to return this phone for a new one.Thanks,Ray Winney"
1,Battery dies + Poor Customer Service from V-Tech,"We thought this was a great 2-line phone which worked really well until the handset stopped working completely. Customer service is very frustrating at v-tech. In order to replace the defective phone they first said it would take 30 days to send out a replacement phone. Then they said they would send me out the replacement first, but I'd have to give them a credit card number to guarantee I'd send the replacement phone back. What kind of company does that?Also they asked me to take down all kinds of reference numbers and address info for them, and asked that I include all of the information about my call to customer service in the box with the phone. (Why bother calling customer service in the first place?) Wouldn't it be better to have a standard form to email customers with all of this info? It seems very antiquated and not at all focused on customer satisfaction."
4,"Buy, Use, Enjoy","I'm a Promotional Chef and I work in business offices with limited space and time. I had used, for 7 years, portable gas burners. In an increasing number of office buildings live flame is not permitted so to keep from going broke I looked for a fast heating/fast cool down replacement for the Gas. . . the PHP323 is the perfect solution. There is no compromise in quality or cooking efficiency. I can make a perfect Omelet for a client's breakfast or a meat-ball sub for lunch. The PHP323 is easy to clean, portable (that is light weight and small) and attractive!An added benefit comes with the stove. . . the 8"" and10"" saute pans are easier to clean with almost no ""scorched on oil residue. I now have three PHP323 stoves."
3,An OK light romatic comedy,"I was hoping for some light reading, a little romance and some characters I could relate to. I didn't have very high expectations, so I can't say I was disappointed. This book was OK. It was a very light read - some parts of it were very entertaining and there are some rather quirky characters and amusing circumstances. But the characters aren't very deeply developed and I can't say I felt like I knew them well or cared much about them. All in all, it sort of reads like a Harlequin type romance. I got it as a freebie so I can't complain. If I had paid sticker price, I probably would feel a bit cheated."
3,almost a four star,"sweet, romantic, but lacking in refinement. the writing style is a little rough around the edges, providing distractions as you read the book. the story line was fine, plot and character development were good, and overall I enjoyed the book."
4,Millie's Fling is a fun read.,"Jill Mansell is a really ""feel good"" writer. Reading Millies Fling was lots of fun and the characters were easy to get to know. I have ordered more of this authors books and look forward to reading the all."
5,When Maeve Met Sophie,"As a huge fan of Maeve Binchy and Sophie Kinsella, Jill Mansell is definitely going on my list. Millie's Fling contained all the description and inter-relationships of one of Binchy's bestsellers and all the humor and laugh out loud moments from the Shopaholic series. I was lucky enough to get this while it was free for Kindle, and after reading it, immediately understood why the price went back up! This was a one day read for me, I had trouble putting it down, and found myself constantly checking in on Millie, Hester, and Orla to see what they were into next when I should have been doing dishes. Any fan of chick lit and/or British/Irish fiction is going to love it. The plot moved along at a great pace, and even with a large cast of characters, I had no trouble keeping up. As a frugal reader, I probably would have never found this had it not been free, but Ms. Mansell is definitely going to be getting some money out of my pockets!"
1,Did not receive the item I ordered!,I ordered 123 Magic and after over a month of waiting received How to Laugh your way to a better marriage. The cost to ship it back and the trouble would be more money out of pocket. Very dissatisfied with this process. This was to be used at a theraputic office for children and families.
5,Who wouldn't love a good love story!,"Great movie. I have not received or reviewed the copy that I purchased from Amazon but it is one of my all time favorites! It was a great era of clean, good, movie making. Everything does not have to be ""baby momma drama"" or ""drug infestation"" when it comes to black love...so to that end I appreciate the promise of a great popcorn viewing and maybe even a little love making for dessert. Enjoy the movie; it warms the heart."
1,Amor en Custodia,"The DVD was horrible because it was so short. While watching it, you are always trying to figure out what is happening. They cut off more than half of the novela, so buying it is a waist."
3,"If it's so great, make me an offer","I have had this camera for two years and I haven't been able to find the settings that produce the crisp, high quality images that I expected based on the available reviews.This was supposed to be a great low light camera. Then why do the indoor pictures come out so grainy? According to the reviews here, it's because auto-mode doesn't work so great. Ohhh. I assumed that auto mode would be ok. Ok. I've picked up a few hints about forcing the camera to use a lower ISO setting in manual mode. We'll try that.The one thing I'll give the camera credit for is great battery life. I bought a couple of extra batteries based on my previous experience with a previous Fujipix camera. Don't really need them."
1,only one fruitfly stuck,"I had an infestation of fruitflies, they were literally everywhere flying around me in my kitchen, so I bought this product hoping to at least get rid of a few. But after 2 weeks, only 1 fly had stuck... I was going around with a notepad and squishing the buggers myself with a success rate of 2-3 a day so clearly this product was useless! I even dabbed to red wine and banana to the top of the column after 1 week because they were really attracted to any red wine I had in a glass... but still it did nothing to get them stuck. And then I actually saw a second fly land on it once, and I watched as it flapped it's wings frantically and within 30 secs it had unstuck itself!!!! This product was a total waste of money!"
1,get something else,"bought this awhile ago, decided to review it now. this thing sucks. there has been flies caught on this, but took over a year to get maybe, 10 or so tiny microscopic flies. no regular flies that you can see with your eyes. i still have it up, only cause it catches flies a few times a year. maybe i should let those little things fly around, or i could get a real fly trap, that actually works. :)"
1,Complete waste of money,This is nothing more than a cardboard box with a little dry adhesive on the outside. It does nothing to attract flies and the adhesive is not gluey enough to trap them if they do happen to land on it. Save your money.
1,ONLY CAUGHT 1 FLY,"Bought at my local Hardware Store. I was having a terrible fly problem, and it only trapped one (1) fly (it's been over a year now, still hanging, still just the same one fly.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,Random luck fly trap,"I don't really think that the design of the cardboard box makes one bit of difference to the flies. House or fruit flies. Flies land on pretty much anything. With sufficient time flies flying around randomly and landing randomly around the house. Eventually they'll land on the fly trap.Perhaps after the first few have landed and died on the trap the rest will be attracted to the scent of the dead flies? Directly out of the box, I don't think there is anything on it that is an attractant."
1,RIpoff,What a horrible product. First of all the item does not work. I have had it up for a week with lots of flies around it and they simply avoid it. Infact the will sit on the window next to it but never go to it. Also it does no look like the one pictured You get the idea that there are small boxes for the flies to enter. Not so. Mine came with black and pink srips running from the top to the bottom. WASTE OF MONEY
1,"Terrible Audiobook - coughs, sniffles, slurred speech","This is the worst audiobook I have ever listened to. The author is the speaker, and from now on, I will shy away from audiobooks that are not read by a professional narrator. The author seems nervous during the first half of the book, so you hear his every breath and sigh, and he even slurs his speech at times. You also get to hear coughs and sniffles. It was very hard to focus on the content due to the distractions on the tape. My biggest complaint is that the author does not annunciate when he speaks. If you must have this book, by all means get the book and not the audiobook! I was very dissappointed and would return it if I had the time to do so."
4,Cheaper at Lowes,"32 oz is $11.38 at my local lowes (Virginia), plus 4.5% tax. 16oz via amazon direct was $10.81. That said, I probably save $3 in gas not driving."
4,Impressed,"[Note: I have only seen ""Messiah of Evil""].I approached ""Messiah of Evil"" without expecting much, but the movie delivered a great deal more than expected. Considering the relatively unknown status of this film, it has many standout psychological horror scenes. The scene in the supermarket is genuinely disturbing. And the scene in the movie theater terrified me for reasons I don't fully understand (and few movies frighten me). And who can deny the wonder of the off-the-wall ""beach-mouse"" scene?This is an unconventional zombie movie with genuine artistic value (as far-fetched as it sounds)."
5,great book for beer lovers,this is a great book.colorful and very informative.highly recom. for beer lovers.
3,Good,"Jackson lacks the knowledge, style, and wit of the foremost authority on beer, Bob Klein, but this book is a good effort. One does miss, however, the scholarship of Klein when reading someone whose focus is as blurred as Jackson and who hasn't the same depth of understanding as Klein."
5,Boxing Basics,A superb book. Although written over 20 years ago the information is timeless. A must have for any true boxer.
3,Slight disappointment- otherwise okay,"I should have listened to the other reviews about how finiky the wind sensor is. The unit is reasonably easy to install and get running. My biggest disappointment came with the Wind Speed Sensor; works, then decided not to work one day; then work another. I don't belive the wind speed really is accurate either. That said the other features work well. The forecast is accurate, the temperature is accurate; the hi/lo features are pretty cool and work. I really wish the wind feature was flawless which it isn't. When it works, it is really neat to know what the wind chill is; then the disappointment when it isn't working. If the wind sensor isn't important for you, this is a good unit. While I didn't think it was important, wait until it fails you once you have had it working..."
1,Own it and you are on your own!,"I thought this product would be much better than it is. Received it as a gift. The only way to change a variable in it is to try to follow the very poor instructions provided. No variable can be changed individually. You must start at the beginning and change all variables to get to the one you want to change. I sent a request to this company's product support unit from its website asking for better, more specific instructions because at first I did not believe anyone would design a unit so poorly. Its been one week and still no response from them. I thought I'd call them instead, but their telephone number is not a toll free call - obviously they do not want to hear from their customers. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!"
5,weather station,"I found it easy to install and easy to read. I will have to find a better location for the wind speed paddle as it is in a sheltered spot and is not giving an accurate reading. My fault, not the equipment!"
2,Good Price - Mediocre Quality,"39 great songs from the Aussie period for a great price. However, these songs are not digitally remastered. I recommend ""Brilliant From Birth"", a 63 song collection which is remastered and contains copius liner notes. You get what you pay for!"
4,If you forgot what it is like to be single..read this book,"On The Loose is accurate in it's description of what it is like to be sinle in the 90's....The story itself is an example of what woman have evolved to..""self-sufficient"" and independant of a man..No more barefoot and pregnant..I am a self-sufficient women who wants to have it all. This book enlightened me to the idea that life is more than your career...If you are a women who has her own mind i would definetly recommend this book."
1,This is NOT generalizable,"Brilliant and innovative idea for a book--but did Roth have to select three vapid, self-absorbed clones to represent the late20s-early30s single woman? The text was certainly entertaining, but I feel that the premise of the book would have been inordinately more effective if the women were a bit more divergent in their jobs and pursuits. Not all of us work in entertainment and date a bunch of jerks."
2,"Bad production, but now without it's charm.","I'm a bit of a collector of superhero memorabilia and wanted to pass on some information on the CD. The material was originally released by Golden Records in the mid to late 60's. The Lp would have been released with a comic. In this case, it would have been a special reprint of Avenger #4 (Captain America Joins the Avengers) and followed the comic word for word.Golden Records didn't put much production value into it's children's records. There's no incidental music and the sound effects are a bit harsh on the ears.This CD has a couple of things going for it that the Superman & Batman releases don't. Number 1, It's fairly easy to find reprints of Avengers #4. One can even find scanned pages in various Yahoo groups or on usenet. Number 2, Avengers #4 reintroduced Captain America. Cap was one of the more important characters of comics Golden Age and having audio that faithfully follows the comic is fun. It's geeky, but it's fun."
5,Excellent boook!,Many varied projects for all skill levels and seasons! Seller and tranaction rated a 10!
2,Not Very Impressed,"I know some reviews have been great and even though I still use this book I am still searching for something with more ""meat"". The illustrations are poor (though the children don't complain). And it's content is lacking in my opinion. It does touch on all the important moments of Lent....the Stations, Ash Wednesday, the Crucifixtion etc but I was hoping for more."
1,"More like memorizing/visualizing, not reading!","I bought this based on the excellent reviews. However, this book doesn't help improve reading skills or phonics.To begin with, there is a picture of the monkey doing something similiar on every page ""monkey sees red balloon"" followed by ""monkey sees yellow balloon"". If there was no text, my daughter could still narrate the story based on the pictures.The best book I have for improving my daughters reading is""Alpha Phonics: A Primer for Beginning Readers."" There are no pictures in teh book, but the phonic sounds are repititive and really help to cement her reading skills. It's teaching the ""sight"" method of reading, which isn't very useful.I would also recommend the ""Bob"" series books for ones with pictures that don't completely give the text away."
3,"Perforates well, but it's not perfect","This perforator does exactly what it was purchased for, but since it is so small, it feels kind of awkward in my hand. I bought this tool becuase I needed it to accurately make a straight perforated line. Since the blade is so small, I cannot have it rest against my guide ruler. I am able to get it to work, but it is not perfect. But, for the price, I cannot really complain. I have not yet located another hand help perforator tool."
4,it was pretty good.,"A coming of age story about the Russell family. Anne tries to keep the family together, taking care of her two nieces. Anne ends up getting married to a mean man, who want let her have any contact with her niece Bentley, and her other niece nikkie who was sickly. The two was left in the hands of Anne's mean sister. When Anne's husband dies, the family is able to reunite, but hardships still come. I don't understand why Anne couldn't call her family when her husband was at work. If you wasen't satisfied with mrs. Mcmillian last few books, I think this one might make you happy."
4,Moving Family Drama,"The triumphs and tragedies of the Russell family will keep you on an emotional roller coaster. This is a griping story about the ties that bind a family. You follow Anne, Bentley, Mae and the other members of the family on their journey to learn life's lessons. This novel makes you look at your life and think about the lessons you've learned."
4,VERY INTERESTING,"This side of Eternity was my favorite book by Rosalyn Mcmillan since Knowing. Other than the historical part of the book, which I felt was unecessary, I thought it was a very interesting story with a lot of meaning. Anne who was my favorite character in the book was an example of the choices that we make sometime. I think her decision to mary that brute was due to a lack of proper guidance,lack of unity in her family, and vulnerability which got her mistaking lust for love.Anne's involvement with Scott Hamilton, was like putting a curse on herself and her family. Prior to meeting Scott, I think Anne had a very promissing future. I think she would've been far more successeful at an earlier age without Scott.This story was very touching dealing with real life issues and very spiritual. I'm sure a lot of us have heard stories similar to Annes or perhaps even lived it.It's been a while Rosalyn. I hope you're working on your next book."
3,Spider--Fun,"This is a nifty reissue of one of the old Spidey story records from the late '60s and early '70s ... at least, it sounds like it. It's a lot of fun, especially for younger kids learning to read, and Spidey is a very kid-friendly superhero.Just one thing: I'd like to know how that other guy knows that the 'Sam Raimi rip-off' movie is bad when it hasn't even been released. I suppose some of us have special powers to see into the future. Or maybe his Spider-sense has warned him. It looks like a lot of fun to me."
2,Ships log along with the Captian explaination,"This is a Ships log explaination from the captian, his thoughts at the time of the events. He explains what he was thinking at the time of the events. Very interesting reading.A tale I could not put down. A little hard reading because of the print is thoes times f and s printed the same as fucefs is sucess at copied from orginal text I pressume."
5,Satisfied customer,This is a very convenient way to shop for items you cannot find in the store any longer and also provides great gift ideas.
4,Good Fun Christmas Movie,"A fun movie to watch. Only problem, no closed captioning or subtitles making it difficult for hard of hearing to watch and understand."
2,This was ok...,I know there are many different Jewish beliefs and approaches. I am not Jewish. The author makes an honest & straitforward approach. A decent read.
1,Never even got a chance to use,"I just received my delivery of the wok and it came in the box that one would find it in if you had purchased it from a department store -- no additional packaging. It was bashed in on two sides and when I opened the box, one handle was broken off and the wok itself was dented. Obviously, I can't rate the cooking capabilities, but I would advise all to not order this wok if it comes from Home and Beyond. I have contacted customer service and although the packaging slip claims their hours are from 9 am to 6 pm and I called before 5 pm, they were closed for the day and the best I could do was leave a message."
2,This is probably not the version you're looking for.,"I can't give it one star because it's Neubauten, but if you are looking at the 1-disc release you are looking at the wrong one. It's a poor 2nd- or 3rd-generation video transfer and the quality is unimpressive.Also there's the problem of Some Bizarre not paying royalties they are supposed to, of course. I found a used copy of this for peanuts at a second-hand shop and thought it might be worth having but now I kinda want my peanuts back.There's a special edition 2-disc ""official"" version of it that has been cleaned up and has extra goodies and such available on the band's website shop, which ships the items directly from Germany (good luck with that)."
4,Les we forget,Portrait in evil is the story bout ordinary people in extraordinary times.Two brothers caught in the web of naziGermany from the time before ww2 through the war and concentrationcamp atrocities.Like holocaust it depicts people that could have been you or me. It is history and as such it needs to be told again and again.It is not a masterpiece but it is a welltold.well worth the money.
2,bad business,"what I could see of the movie was very good, problem is only half the movie is on the DVD I am very disappointed and recommend legal steps against the distributor since this is not a single incident!!!"
5,Just right,"I bought this for my 3 year old grandson and it was a great introduction to the real meaning of Christmas. We sat next to the Nativity and as I read the book, he would point and identify each of the figures and asked questions so we felt good about what he learned. I really recommend it."
1,Not at all like new !,"Avertised ""like new"" ;however, extensive highlighting and even notes crossed out. Corners bent. Condition not at all as advertised!"
4,Un foray francais,"This is a great book for students de francais. It's a super easy read, particularly if you're familiar with the story en englais. Give it a go!"
1,Horrible translation,"The English version of this book is great. Unfortunately, the French translation is dreadful. The translator apparently became bored with the book and has left out ENTIRE PAGES of the story. It is probably the worst translation I have ever read of any book."
5,A bolt is not just a bolt!,"These work better than I expected. Without those elusive, costly dust caps, the collars on these bolts kept out unwanted dust and dirt."
2,Did not like product,"I purchased this item, my husband loves poached eggs.In order to read the measuring cup, you need 20 20 vision and still use a magnifying glass. The instruction booklet is not correct.I wasted 6 eggs trying to get the eggs cooked the way we like them. Once we figured it out the eggs came out ""ok"",I would not recommend this product."
4,Very convenient,"I looked for a tool for the ""poached"" eggs for a while and this one is perfect.Also for hardboiled egs as well.Using it twice a week now."
5,Pretty handy,"This is so much more effective and less time consuming than boiling a pot of water for eggs. I eat hard boiled eggs everyday and I know this is going to save me tons of effort. Cleanup is easy, too. Too bad there was not room for dozen eggs in the holder! One complaint--when the cooking cycle is complete, the timer buzzer sounds like one from a clothes dryer, it is quite loud and annoying. I suppose it should be, though, as this machine does not turn off by itself when the cycle is complete."
1,Amazon is selling defect product.,"This ""brand new "" machine failed after 1 week of use. The alarm keeps crying even when the water is not boiling at all. Amazon refused to fully refund it. What a shame! Maybe Amazon is selling refurbished items as new?"
4,Idiot Proof - almost,I love this product. High omega eggs are good for my children and I can't remember to watch the boil - so this comes in very handy. Except I always forget which direction is egg warm and which is cook. Idiot proof - almost.
5,Don,Was not sure about this when I bought it but used it several times and it is a great product hard boiled eggs come out perfect would recommend it.
3,Cooks well,This is a good product and I've cooked all of my eggs fully BUT it doesn't have an alarm- doesn't turn off or sound when it's done- I have to use a seperate timer which is very strange. However the clean up is much easier and I just put them in the machine turn it on- set the timer and it's done.
4,"Great for boiled eggs, not so great for poached eggs.","We have used the Krups 230-70 Egg Express Cooker primarily to cook soft-boiled eggs, which it does well, although the markings on the included water measuring device are a little hard to read, which makes it harder to cook them to the same level of doneness each time. When we have cooked a single poached egg for each of us in the poaching pan, however, we found that it was too large to do a good job, producing an egg with a very thin white section, although the directions say it's meant to cook a single egg in each cup. We haven't tried putting two eggs in each cup, though, so it may do a better job with those."
3,Lasted 8 months,"Until a week ago I would've told you this was a great egg cooker. The alarm is pleasant sounding. The eggs are done perfectly. It's compact. But it only lasted 8 months and then the knob on front broke off when I tried to turn the cooker on. On further examination it was a bad design. Instead of having the knob attached to a metal piece, it's rubber and it ripped. I can't see buying another of this design. My previous egg cooker had lasted over 10 years. Disappointing."
3,Throwaway enjoyablity,"This is fun if not a little convoluted and often unbelievable. The premise dealing with a major financial corporation and the ends to which it will go to protect itself is quite frightening. Overall, okay."
2,"Great picture, so-so movie","Muddled plot and wooden acting by the leads aside, the movie does look fantastic on Blu Ray, reference quality picture. Its beautiful. But under the surface of that beauty, is nothing. Clive Owens is Clive Owens. There is nothing new in his performance. Its the same as every other movie he has been in since Bourne Identity. Naomi Woods has a throw away role. The studio could have saved money with a lesser known actress. The dozen or so supporting actors save the movie, making it watchable, but the story isn't engaging. You don't care about the good or bad guys. You just wait for the next pretty location shot. There is a blip of hope in the middle that makes you think this shouldn't have been a box office failure. That feeling of hope doesn't last. Save your money."
4,one of my favorites,"I remember watching this film when i was 9 or 10 back in the late 50's or early 60's after mt father went to work and my mom was asleep.There have been three or four spin offs to this great film that don't even come close.I don't no for sure but it seems that they left something out of this makeover.It doesn't matter this is a five star movie, that i rated four because i was stupid and hit the four star and it won't let me change me it."
4,THE ORIGINAL 1939 VERSION.,"According to legend, a vicious hound stalks the descendents fo Sir Hugo Baskerville in order to avenge the death of an abducted peasant girl. Latest to assume the heritage is young Sir Henry (the dimpled Richard Greene) who arrives from Canada after the mysterious death of his uncle...As a trivia note, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel was first serialised in THE STRAND magazine between August of 1901 & April of 1902. Anita Louise was originally to have played Beryl Stapleton but was later replaced with Wendy Barrie because it was decided - and probably quite rightfully - that British moviegoers wouldn't accept the picture unless it featured an all-English cast. The final line of the film is a dilly!"
3,"Interesting adaptation, but book is by far superior",Not entirelly what I envisioned after reading the story. Parts of the story were taken out and some characters missing. The movie really zips through the entire story much to quickly while leaving out very valuable information. I recommend reading the story before purchase of this movie. I can't imagin how difficult it might be for someone to follow the clues and the storyline without reading the book.
4,Lights to Boot,"Isn't it amazing, as Mr. Groothuis points out, the sheer number of NDEs that have cropped up in the past years? Why don't they occur evenly throughout time, instead of in convenient, sporadic clusters when such experiences are ... dare Groothuis say it ... popular?Dramatic! Beautiful! Uplifting! Hopebound! The truth? Well, let's see. Eadie, no doubt, believes every word she says -- that doesn't mean the person listening and looking into her bubbly face has to. There are several problems with simply nodding your head as someone proclaims they have had a NDE, and Groothuis points them out in this particular case of Eadie.He also highlights other issues in his book, including the subject of nirvana, new age cults, and other, in all fairness, a la mode movements that have gripped the ""open-minded, yet gullible"". Wrongfully accused of fundamentalism, Groothuis simply states the facts about the myriad of stories, cults, and various other paraphernalia barging down our doors."
5,It's great,This is the greatest little machine. I've been using it about 5 times a week for almost a year. Don't fool with boxed mixes because they are too large and it just gets messy trying to use the balance of the mix. Try some of the recipes in the manual. It now takes me all of 4 minutes to load and go. My wife thinks it's great too.
4,"Plain bread lovers, beware!","I bought this breadmaker 2 years ago. The first loaf I made was the French bread and I thought it was, well, let's just say it didn't taste like french bread. It was too sweet and yeasty tasting. Then I made the basic white. It was just as disappointing. Not to be put off by that, I tried many of other recipes provided in the instruction booklet. This is where I had much more success. The favored breads are far better tasting than the plain ones.As far as unit itself in concerned, it is small. I keep it in a kitchen cabinet when not in use. It's not too loud during the kneading process and couldn't be simpler to operate. Just press a button.If you follow the instructions, you can't go wrong. I always get consistent results. I even experiment with adding different ingredients. So, if you like flavored breads, this is great little machine."
2,Bad compromise,"The virtue of this machine is that it makes a small loaf of bread quickly. The downside is that it does this one task badly. Because there is only one rise cycle, it makes a terrible loaf of bread suitable only for those with the lowest standards."
1,piece of junk,"After one use the motor woudl no longer turn the little stirrer inside the machine. It malfunctioned after ONE USE. This item is unreliable, and made of cheap thin aluminum. Do not buy this."
4,Perfect for 2!,"We received this for a wedding present and I really love the loaves, though I think that my husband was expecting it to taste a bit more hand made or something.Have found it easy to use, have only tried the easiest recipes - for white and french bread and once we move into our first home I hope to get round to picking up ingredients for some of the more exotic recipes.The loaf is very cute and though small, has always been a very good shape so that it was possible to get around six good sized slices. The crust has been thick and crispy and the center is fluffy and uniform. And the smell is divine! I am glad for a smaller loaf otherwise after smelling it during baking I would eat way too much (and bread can be lethally fattening!!)Recommended."
5,Excellent breadmaker.,Very pleased with this small breadmaker. Every recipe turns out great. Sized for small family. Bread baked to perfection in 45 minutes.
5,"Great tea, exactly like from a Thai restaurant.","I've read a lot of the reviews here for different people's preparation of this tea. I personally brewed this in a big coffee maker and made it nice and strong, added about a cup of sugar, then put it in the fridge and it came out exactly like from a Thai restaurant. I recommend this for anyone looking for really good, authentic Thai iced tea."
4,Amazing I can see result now.,"This product is great, I will continue to buy more, it even removes blemishes, my whole body an face is softer an clear. I even gave my mom few pills for 2 weeks an she saw results. I'm loving this. I will b buying my next months pills soon.tnx"
3,Hmmm. gave me a rash,"Some good, some bad. I bought this and starting taking two tablets daily as directed. I'm a man in my mid 30s and I've struggled with acne on and off for much longer than I thought possible. While I was taking the zinc, my face felt less greasy and I had fewer breakouts, BUT..... about 10 days in to the zinc regiment my wife noticed a strange rash on my upper chest, inside of my biceps and wrists. I did a little research and realized that this can be caused by zinc. I stopped taking the zinc and the rash has since gone away. I'm going to start again with one tablet per day and see if my body can handle that. Just beware the side effects of these things...."
1,"worst, ever.","i know zinc is good for the skin, but this sucked. i read the other reviews, and thought how can others break out from using this? i sitll don't know the answers, but it is terrible! i hate this, i stopped taking it and i didn't break out as bad as that. i went to my local drug store and got vitamins good for hair, skin, and nails. WORKS A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER!"
3,Draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag,"This book at best can be described as a dragging narration of a poorly planned combined secret mission between CIA and IB (Indian Intelligence Bureau) in the mid 60s. The book goes on and on about things that the mountain climbers had to go through for planting a sensor (actually two or three) on Himalayan peaks for eavesdropping on China. The book probably gains some importance because the loss of one of the sensors made headlines nearly 10 years afterwards due to fear of contamination of the holy Ganges river. The whole story sounds real silly with a lot of money spent for no evident goal. The writer displays some good style, but often the narration goes haywire making the reader wonder where he is being led to."
4,Jimmy Buffett,"Jimmy Buffett is one of my favorites, whether it is his music or his writing. He always entertains and he is always up beat and positive. He always puts a smile on my face."
4,The Psychology of the Market Place,"This is fundamentally a psychological interpretation of the relevance of the variable Too Big To Fail(TBTF) on the interactions of policymakers and the banking system. Although the authors do not stress their analysis as a psychological approach their analysis as a psychological approach is a compelling example of a Skinnerian analysis of reinforcements contingencies. It provides a compelling analysis about the causes and effects on TBTF. on both the national and international economies. It recommends essentially a carefully controlled use of incentives and to a lessor extent punishment to reduce both the need for and expectations of TBTF. The contrast between the recommendations of Stern & Feldman in 1994 and the present state off fiscal chaos through contiguous extremes of reward and punishment exerted upon the market by policymakers defies the shaping of not only rational behavior but lends credence to the claim of a ""manic depressive market"" and why."
5,Super Hapkido,"Hapkido Essentials and the two Hapkido Self Defense volumes are great for technique review. These products are good for those individuals that are now training or having had some previous experience in Hapkido or other similar Korean martial arts. It is difficult to see the hand positions for many of the techniques. Other than that you will see super rolling, throwing, blocking, locking, rotation, and flexion."
5,Helpful,"As always Eric Svendsen is enlightening and direct in his approach to countering dogmatic Roman Catholics claiming the keys of Peter. I would have appreciated Eric mentioning that any donation of Petrine keys would have been deposited at Jerusalem and Antioch (Orthodox Churches) far prior to his supposed last days in Rome.Svendsen makes clear that the same errant private interpretation catholic converts utilize in deciding the RC is the true church is the very method they are restrained from utiliing in determining religios truths. But his attempt to show more unity among protestant churches than catholic I feel was unsuccessful.I do recommend this little book to any engaged in internet debates over Petrine ""keys of knowledge"" but wish Eric had delved into the subject of the ""keys"" of binding and loosing vs keys of knowledge. There's a good source for these differentiations, and it is a Papal Bull by Pope John XXII 'Quia Qorundum'."
4,This Is A Wonderful CD!,"This is a great CD, the songs are fun and they bring back good memories of listening to the songs when I was little and really I still love to listen to these songs and always will. I also have fond memories of watching the Christmas specials that these songs are from! All the songs on the CD are good but the best are Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Frosty The Snowman, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, Holly Jolly Christmas, Jingle, Jingle, Jingle and Silver and Gold. I very highly recommend this CD for both the young and the young at heart. /"

2,"To each, his own...","Is there any other explenation to give rather than to say this IS sort of an advertisment for the old movie? I was thinking about it. And that's what I came up with.If you were a big fan of the old ""The Flight of the Phoenix "", I don't know if you'd give this a nice warm welcome. The specail effects might be amazing, but why take a good and great movie and reinact it?I should point out, that in the old movie there were no woman [and Im not saying it because it botherd me, or something like that] but in this one there are. I think it is trying to be politicaly-correct.I know my dad, who is a big fan of the old and great ""Flight of the Phoenix"" wouldn't enjoy this movie.."
1,"Trash,....rubbish ...what more can be said...",Save your money...or better still buy the original 1965 version thats great!!This is a case of the re-make being by far the worse of the two. The new film has all the hallmarks of a film to please the masses... its politically correct.... its got people with attitude...and don't try to take on the Americans...cause they will kick your a**...Appalling rubbish and quite painful to watch. And if you know anything about aviation your going to laugh at how bad it is...
5,The sister you always wanted,Wait Wait Her mom's sick so she goes up in the mountains to see her aunt who even isn't there? Well at least she as her spook yeast. What is spook yeast you ask. And who helps her along the way. There is only one way to find out... so read this awesome book.
5,If you're looking...,If you're looking for a stethoscope then you already know that this is the top middle end and price stethoscopes.
2,WHY did they have to include graphic lesbianism on a topic of Kabbalah?,"I don't offend easily and I am certainly not a prude, but mixing the Kabbalah with a very graphic Lesbian scene just was not necessary. I would have gotten much more out of it if it weren't clouded by this. Actually, 3 weeks later, the Lesbian scene is mostly what I remember from the movie!"
5,Toilet Boys are missed,"What a great CD from the greatest rock band in NYC.I feel bad for any of you who never got to see these guys live. This CD is the next best thing. It is a crime that these guys never broke out and became a worldwide sensation. Pick this up and you'll know exactly what I mean.Standouts are Heartstopper and Saturday Nite. The whole CD is very solid, and well worth the $$."
4,"Jolene, Jolene, Joleeeene :)","Jolene is a classic! What a great song! I love the fact I know the background story :) But then you also have the ever beautiful I will always love you, My Tennessee Mountain home and Letter: where Dolly reads us a letter she wrote when she was young and alone in the big country city. Many good songs, a few HUGE classics and a rare glimpse of how she lived her early days of struggle in music."
1,atmosphere,"i cannot believe what i just heard. The track Kurt Cobain is a blaitant rippoff of atmosphere. If you want to try to cover and woman with the tatooed hands, you better come up with some of the best lyrics i ever heard. To listen to some no talent ass clown flow on that beat like that makes me cringe in my seat. i honestly cant believe that someone in the year 2005 needs to rely on jacking a beat from something that is so underground and unbelievably heartfelt as Atmosphere. if nobody knows what im talking about, then, that sucks for YOU! i truly am worried what is going with the world now. all i have to say is LOVE LIVE, and be your damn self. never bite. never steal. never be wack. peace....enlightenment for the weak."
4,Proof that hes got what it takes (PUN INTENDED),"a solid album from the 2nd best member of D12 (behind eminem) this album is alot better then encore which was a dissapointment. the album is as raw and dark as i expected from Proof after hearing several mixtapes from him. i am pleased to see that he idnt use shady records in order to promote his album and am glad to see no production from the shady/aftermath camp, the reason this is good is that it means it differs from all of their other release where the production sounds the same. Proof is very talented and im happy with this purchase"
4,Another great Gundam!,"This is one of my favorite models I have ever made! The colors were spot on, and the level of detail was better than your average master grade kit. Lots of parts, lots of time to make it, but once it'scomplete, wow what a rewarding experiance! The ONLY down side to this model is that since it is so bulky with the added arnor, it is not the most posable and the armor falls off. Sometimes. Other than that its great and those two small cons definately do not out weight the pros, but they do cost it one star."
5,Little known era of naval warfare - part 2!,"This book covers a later period than its companion, Fighting Ships of the Far East (1), including the amazing Dragon Ships of Korea that were used to expel the Japanese invaders. Any student of naval warfare would do well to purchase this book."
3,Weird pulp.,"Corny. Zany. Completely Unbelievable. Wonderful Science Fiction (though heavy on the fiction). Enjoyable to read. This book is all of these things. While I enjoyed reading it, at the end it became so unbelievable it lost me. It feels like he Barnes lost a bet and had to write a bit of science fiction with every trope ever created stuck in somewhere. Hard to rank low because it made me think and was largely fun to read. Hard to rank highly because the plot made nearly no sense and neither did the characters. The _world_ seemed odd, but fairly consistent and perhaps even realistic in its own way."
5,What a Pleasure!,"Most books about American education are either unreadable or fail to tell the truth. What a pleasure to read one that is clear, well-written, and above all, truthful. The authors pull no punches, insisting from the outset that ""American urban education is a national disgrace."" From there, the book is cogently argued, challenging the many shibboleths that distort the school reform debate and refusing to be boxed in by the conventional reform wisdom. See, for example the discussion on ""hardwiring innovation"" in Chapter 11. Best of all, the analysis carries the debate about public education in America to the next level, i.e., what we can actually change now to starting making things better. Overall, ""Legacy"" is both perceptive and engagingly written. This book, if widely enough read and heeded, can do what most books on education reform only dream about--make a difference."
3,Not a fan of this,for landscape or portrait work. Takes to long ro position & when tilt for portrait mode (vertical) the camera is off center to the tripod so my long glass at risk to fall over. I ahve switched to a Really Right Stuff ballhead & love it. This may be better suited for video work.
1,Horrible replacement.,"I'm really upset with Bogen/Manfrotto. They discontinued my personal favorite head, the 3030, and replaced it with this one. Obviously, they did not ask photographers before making the switch. I had to buy a new tripod for our studio. We have several 3030 heads but since they were discontinued, I purchased this one. Everybody hates it. Simply put, it's clunky and seems to be very convoluted. The handles are extremely diminuitive. The quick release has gone backwards in engineering. It's the red-headed stepchild tripod of our studio and is constantly being shunned. We won't buy anymore. In fact, I'm using eBay to buy the old 3030. Bogen, bring it back! It's similar to when Ford went from the '64 1/2 - '66 Mustang to the '67. Why??? You had a classic.If you've never used this head's precurser, then you might like this head simply because you don't know how much of a step backwards it took."
1,A junker - no bearings,"Don't buy this Man 804RC2 unless you try it first with your gear to be sure it does what you want (i.e., don't buy on name or photo alone). All the bearings are dry plastic-on-plastic. I needed this to hold my high optical-powered gear steady and to get there smoothly and easily. Instead, every movement is jerk, jerk, jerk -- oversteer, jerk, jerk, -- understeer, -- jerk, jerk ...same. Almost better to handhold your gear and rest it on a tree. I finally resorted to spraying WD-40 in the joints and it actually improved things a bit. Total waste of money and time. I can't imagine what use they had in mind or what customer would find this acceptable. It's just a complicated-looking toy pan and tilt head."
3,The numb-noggined ninety knocks out a book.,"This book could have been two magnitudes better with a reader who doesn't think Papal rhymes with apple, and a writer who doesn't believe that when a prison term is reduced, it's been ""communed"".The boring reader makes several more laughable gaffes, and Kareem, probably thinking he's being scholarly, a number of times gives see references to other chapters of the book mid-sentence.If the movers and shakers of the Harlem Renaissance comprisedwhat Kareem refers to as the ""talented tenth"" of the local populace, his effort at chronicling the movement betrays himself, his contributor and narrator as representatives of the ""numb-nogginedninety""."
3,"This book is outdated, but not useless","Even being an (unemployed)agronomist here in Brazil, I love to read books about world's situation.I read this book about eight years ago.This book has many usefull informations.The best in this book is chapter 6.At the same time, this book is now outdated.Japan has no possiblity to be world's leader, in XXI Century.Europe is changing.USA had no big problem after all, with military expending or anything else.After all, this book is outdated, but not useless."
2,NOT a good fit,Purchased these for a 2011 Ford Ranger XLT 4 dr. The passenger side fits like a glove but the driver's side does not. It is too wide and sits way too high on the door side of the mat. We hit it with our foot every time we get in. Because it is too wide it doesnt fit flat and rises up & down when you move your feet. Not happy.
3,Quick Read,This took me two hours to read. It shows how God moved in various cities and reports were filed by ministers. I was a little disappointed since I expected more than this.
5,Awesome tv show!,"Walker Texas Ranger Season 6 is awesome! If you like Walker Texas Ranger or if you have never seen the show, I promise you that you will love this season of Walker."
1,Walker Texas Ranger Season 6 poor video quality,I have seasons 1-5 and the final season in boxed sets.Season 6 came in a jewel case with 5 dvds in it.The quality of season 6 is far below that of the other seasons.These are for my mother who is in a nursing home. she has her own tv and dvd player that I supplied so I know how it works.
2,Not a happy Amazon client,"My first experience purchasing Amazon video's was very costly.I was not aware I had to nominate a region format for my video. In any case surely my postal address would indicate where I wished to view the video.After all why would I purchase a NTSC format video to view in Indonesia or Australia who use PAL format.The experience has cost me the equivalent of US$20 for return postage to ensure the returns are received prior to November 1 in order to receive a credit. Now I have been advised one of the series is no longer available, I assume Amazon means in PAL format.Not an experience I would recommend."
3,MADE FOR TV,"Ok dvd, good to watch with your family as there is no cursing and the total story can be explained in 5 seconds."
5,Old Guitar player,"I think I have most of Joe Pass's CD's. This one is my favorite by far. Maybe it's because I'm an old man that has played guitar for around fifty years, or maybe it's because the songs are from ""my era"", but this is fantastic Jazz guitar palyed in memory of the great Fred Astaire. When listeng to this you can almost see Fred dancing. Pass is the smoothest guitarist that ever lived in my view. His runs have fantastic speed and duration and they never ever falter. Pass once said,:"" If the chords are too difficult, don't use them"" and his palying demonstrates why that is a true statement. The chords Pass uses are for the most part relativly simple, but they are used in all of the right places, his ability to match harmony with his speed and smoothness create fantastic listening for anyone that appreciates jazz guitar. This one can't be topped!!"
1,Connection is not about daring ..................,"If the title of this book appeals to you, let me save you from wasting your time buying it, and guide you to the truth about why you are not connected and how you can be.Go to the the listing for ""The Biology Of Love"" by Arthur Janov and type ""connection is healing"" in the search box in the ""click to look inside"" feature. Then buy that fantastic book which contains more insight in every paragraph than all the pages of this book you are considering.To briefly explain what you will find, when you connect feelings on the inside (which requires time and effort), connections with others become easy, relaxed and bountiful."
3,My son loved it,We bought this as part of a homeschooling reading program -- and it has become a favorite.
4,"Not the *best* early reader, but still a good book","This is one of the earlier Berenstain Bear books, and it shows. Despite the cover, the bears on the *inside* of this book are less stylized and cutesy than the bears in the newer books, and the story is an early reader instead of a longer read-aloud.It's a cute little story about a cub suffering from ""grass is greener"" syndrome, but unable to decide which hat to get. Eventually he decides his old one is perfect - you saw that coming!There are only a few words per page, with a basic vocabulary, so this one is perfect little-little ones learning to talk. I do find that many of the words in this book are too uncommon, too long, or follow too odd spelling rules for this book to really function as an early reader. But it's so funny that I don't think that really matters."
5,"Old Hat, New Hat",I purchased this delightful book as a Christmas gift for my two-year-old grandson as my daughter had checked it out from the public library and he loved it. He was thrilled to receive his very own copy and has it memorized. It is a classic and also delighted my children.
2,I'll keep it short,"I've read worse books, but that says more about the state of the publishing industry than about Emerald.It's another one of those books, where the heroine is impossibly beautiful, and manages to overcome a humble beginning to be fabulously rich and successful ... and, of course, she gets the boy. So far, I've described the perfect beach read, but Emerald has far more going on than that.Two examples, and then I'll let you read the other recommendations that yield this novel an astonishing average rating of 4 stars.First, Emerald spends her adolescence in Mexico, where she has her first boyfriend. His name was Nacho.Second, the man she's in love with throughout the story, the star-crossed lover in question is ... her adopted brother??? Ew? This is never addressed properly, in my estimation. Luard attempts to gloss over the genesis of their relationship, but HE WAS HER BROTHER.Poor old Nacho doesn't even merit a phone call."
1,Unacceptable Quality,"I bought one of these and put it on...it broke the second time I latched it. I bought another one and installed it (Thinking I may have just got at bad part)...it broke the first time I latched it. This part is very cheaply made, but it's the only rear window latch that I was able to find at two different auto parts stores."
2,Borderline novel,"This is a good story but poor in the telling. Ms. Baldwin was trying for a ""stream of consciousness"" effect but the end result were too many run-on's (complete sentences within each other) and lack of references (too many places where you don't know to whom or what she is referring). Confusing. Where was her editor?More than that, however, were a lack of definitions (a glossary, perhaps) for the innumerable Indian words and a detailed map of the whole of India. Not least, the author assumes the reader has at least a working knowledge of Indian mythology.Too bad, as the subject deserves a hearing."
4,Quality Massage Table,"Very pleased with the Master Massage Monroe 30 inch Salon Size massage table. It was delivered on time. No damage. Rolling carrying case, as well as well-stitched handles, helps with transport. Easy set-up. Solidly built. No 'wiggle' when massaging. Love the adjustable headrest made with metal hardware, not plastic. I found the adjustable armrest disconcerting at first but now love the comfortable position it provides. I would recommend this portable massage table without hesitation."
2,Give this table/experience 4 stars,"First, kudos to Amazon in addressing a problem with this order. I originally ordered this table on Dec. 5 - it never came. I called, and Amazon re-shipped another table, and I received it in time to give the table as a Christmas present to my husband. GOOD JOB AMAZON!Second, the manufacturer shipped the table in a box WITH THE BOX'S CONTENTS LABELED IN LARGE, BLACK LETTERS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. So much for surprising my husband - when the box was delivered, he received it, and read what it was. DEAR MANUFACTURER - DO NOT LABLE A BOX'S CONTENTS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX - you lost a star in my rating for doing so.Third, the table is GREAT! Five stars for the quality and cost of the table."
4,"Mostly modeling, little painting","Overall the book is pretty good - a bit surprising considering its small size.The book focuses on modeling figures, with less space devoted to painting. Converting and building from scratch is covered, in various scales and using different materials. Text is accompanied by many pictures - small, but clear and helpful.Painting is described using acrylics, mixed from generic colors. Each time color variations are shown, giving a good idea of how to mix intermediate hues. Lack of reference to premixed colors by any paint manufacturer is good - makes it easy to apply for everyone.The book suffers a bit because of small size - photos are smallish and there is relatively little text. I personally found text a bit too short in places, esp. painting feels not explained in depth. But overall it's a very decent effort, covering a lot of ground, and doing it well."
3,Stamp this one off your wish list,"A very catchy cover that promises to deliver some really interesting projects. Unfortunately, it is a dismal disappointment. I'm surprised that the ""editor"" even showed her name.The text is badly written, with a lot of sentences repeated. I found this feature quite annoying. The author's writing style is tedious, but if you can't fall asleep at night, try getting through a chapter of this and you'll be snoozing in no time!I guess you can use this book to ""Stamp out insomnia""!Written by an engineer from central New York, its no wonder the style is awful and the code doesn't work! Engineers in CNY are always rushed to get product out the door, whatever the cost to quality, and the fact that this book is rife with errors and typos only shows the lack of technical skills of the ""editor"".Nice, pretty cover though."
3,Energon contiues the Unicron Trilogy,"Energon, the second installment in the Unicron Trilogy, (Armada, Energon, Cybertron) proves to be a pretty interesting series. Although slower and not as ""emotional"" as Armada, its still a good cartoon to watch if you love anything Transformers. Like other reviewers will tell you, the anime style IS clunky and not very realisic. And the kids in the series can get bothersome. Armada ""grabbed"" you more, while this is just a basic version of the TF's, nothind extraordinary. The good points are that the storylines continue from show to show, and pick up exactly where they left off, so its like one long movie. Also its cool to have watched the entire trilogy, so you dont feel like youve missed anything. Arcee returns as well, and is one of the more interesting characters."
5,NOTHING BUT FUN!,"Like watching the show itself, reading Backstage with the Original Hollywood Square was nothing but fun. I loved hearing the little-known stories about people I felt I'd visited so often in the past. I almost felt I knew them then, and now I feel like I know them even better.I enjoyed learning how the game was constructed and how the stars came up with all those funny lines. The color photos were so beautiful, I'm almost tempted to cut up my book and create a photo album, but I'm going to resist the impulse (unless I get another one for Christmas.)Of course, the CD is priceless. I've been listening to it in my car and it keeps me laughing through traffic.I recommend this one highly."
2,Original style is more comfortable,"As a larger man, I've found that the Comfort Soft style of boxer brief is far from comfortable compared to their original style (with slightly longer legs and a standard waistband).For larger individuals, these types have a tendency to feel like they're falling off on the top, while also feeling more cramped on the bottom. The standard style provides a more even fit both at the legs and at the waist area.There is a benefit to this type, which depends on the time of year in which you wear them: they seem to be made of a thicker fabric than the original style, which is nice for insulation in winter months. (Of course, there's a big caveat in this benefit: they're less comfortable in summer months due as a result)"
5,DO NOT WANT TO TAKE OFF!,"SOFT, PLESEANT TO TOUCH, NICE COLORS. PERFECT FIT! OPENIN THE DRAW IN THE MORNING LOOKING FOR HANES! THE BEST!"
2,Not the best deal,"Let me tell you that the product is as promised, very good. Let me tell you that shipping times are also very good. What I did not like is their inability to handle more than 1 package per order. I wanted 4 packs and I had to order them separately after realizing that my order for the 4 was not taken. I even thought Amazon had a bug. But they jsut want to charge you the shipping and handling 4 times instead of making it easy for you. If they can better that, I would consider buying from them again."
1,It hurts if you have butt,seams right where you sit ouch. also a very low cut waist band which tends to roll.
3,boxer briefs,These are looser fitting than I usually like; they are good quality and hold up well after washing
2,Don't make them like they used to,"I have had these same underwear for the last six or maybe ten years and they finally died on me. The old ones were comfortable, soft and roomy where it counts. So I finally bought replacement ones. Same brand, same everything but they are really not made the same way. It feels like the material is 1/2 as thick as the old ones. Don't think these new versions will last as long but maybe that's the new marketing strategy from Hanes."
3,They don't make 'em like they used to,"I like this style and fit and price and have worn Hanes for many years. However, they clearly have changed the specifications and the cotton is thin and somewhat scratchy. Nor do they last as long."
5,Perfect Transaction,The product was exactly as stated and arrived very quickly. It was a flawless transaction.
1,Hanes ComfortSoft Boxer Briefs,Major shrinkage after first wash and failed stitching around waistband after second / third wash quickly rendered these shorts useful for not much more than dust rags. Very comfortable however the first and only few times they were wearable.
1,Abrasive waistband. Legs stretch out by the end of the day.,"I bought Hanes 7460F5 at a big box store. (Slightly different number, but they look the same as the photo.) The waistband was abrasive right out of the pack. I washed them and it's still the same. The material feels like emery cloth rubbing against my skin -- especially when pulling them down or adjusting them. By the end of the day the legs are stretched out. They go back to normal when washed, but they don't stay that way. I'm sending them back."
3,It's OK but not as good as previous version.,"I was a fan of these briefs, having purchased a number of them over the last two years. However, those ones were made of a noticeably thicker cotton than these newer ones. You can tell these newer versions are much thinner, cheaper feeling, and will probably wear out quicker. A bit disappointed that they decided to cut costs and go with the thinner material."
4,Big Shorts,"These are comfortable and easily fit around my meat & potatoes waist, but they are long. My wife makes fun of me because the hems stick-out below my shorts. I thought layering was slimming. Quality is good: just what you would expect from such a venerable underwear manufacturer."
5,Blessings,"I am watching this now and I am very touched by the honesty and courage of these families to share something so personal and cherished. All Americans should see this film so they can connect the sacrifice that some have made for this country.It is amazing to me that they are able to read the letters without completely breaking down. Such courage,Thank you and blessings to all of the loved ones of those who have not come home from Iraq and Afghanistan."
1,Does not rate a star,"I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of quality on this time. Within less than 3 weeks of wearing the ring, one of the CZ stones already fell out of its setting. Prior to that, I noticed that within the 1st week of wearing the ring, some of the stones were already loose within their settings."
1,Save your money,Within a week of wearing the ring the biggest stone fell out. Was really disappointed because for the price the ring looked pretty good.
4,An evenhanded look,"This great bio by Richard Hack follows the life of the long time director of the F.B.IJ. Edgar Hoover starting with his boyhood in the Washington area and following him through his school days and onward to the seat of power. We get an interesting look at Hoover from the days of the mid-west gangsters to hilarious rants on Martin Luther King that border on paranoia.Before when I thought of J. Edgar Hoover I always had a vague picture an evil man who indulged in activates in secret that he ruined other people for. It is interesting to see the interpretation in this book; it was not the man that was evil it was just that as time went on he used evil methods to hold on to his power.While it is tempting for some to want a watershed moment where Hoover would either ""get with it"" or retire it never arrives. Instead Hoover goes on becoming less and less relevant and that if nothing else can be considered a form of poetic justice."
5,Matlock - The Second Season,"Andy Griffith is (was) one of my favorite actors, and I have always really enjoyed his shows. I really like the 2nd season set and have shared it with family."
3,Yet another,"Story written about the infamous Darlie Routier who was tried and convicted for the murder of her young son. Although both boys were murdered the state of Texas only tried her for one murder. She was found to be guilty and sentenced to death. There have been several books written about the case, some good, some not so good. This read was mediocre, it didn't bring about anything that hadn't already been wrote, but the story was told accurately as reported by the media."
2,Hush up all ready!,"I have read many a true crime novel but this one bored me to death! Perhaps I am lacking in symapthy but one minute it seems the author wants to portray Darlie Routier as a mother who killed her two sons, then about half way towards the end makes it like somebody else did it. All and all you might as well watch Court TV. This was pathetic! I had no more an idea of what happened in the beginning than at the end of this book."
3,A Work in Progress,"The book tells some of the story, but this case has serious errors in it that needs to be looked into."
1,Disgust,"This is more a hedonistic homosexual romance novel than anything resembling science fiction. It is very slow. None of the characters are anyone I would want to hang with. In the finale (I have no idea how I got that far), our heroine asks another man to sodomize her husband while she watches. This book no way deserves one star."
5,Sure to be a Christmas classic,What a perfect addition to your family's collection of Christmas literature! This whimsical rhyme is so realistic for those of us who are cat lovers. The illustrations are adorable! I hope to see many more volumes on the adventures of this mischievous feline!
5,Great for beginners learning epi or those who need to brush up.,"Not often do I take the time to write a review for a book, especially a text book. However, I have to say that this book was worth the purchase. I am a public health graduate student and epi is a core course for the degree program. It's been almost three years since I took my intro epi course and I have not used some of the epi terminology in a while (don't use it, you lose it.) I am now studying for my comprehensive exam and I find that this book is a lot more reader friendly than the book I had to use for my actual course. The explanations within the book are helpful and the diagrams help reinforce the material. It makes me wonder if there is a biostats book written like this one..? Anyway, great book, I would recommend it."
3,my new struts,"This is a good price for the new struts. I replace it my self in my 1998 toyota 4runner in the front and using the manual compressor was not easy. After I installed I'm so excited to drive my truck but not much difference with the ride. Two things that came to my mind, maybe my old struts(169,000miles) on it which is a toyota original struts was still ok or the new one which is the the monroe is not that good. I have mix feelings and some regrets that maybe I should bought the the Rancho brand for extra 30-40 dollars."
3,Heartwarming,A nice book. The plot was not that deep but the storyline about the tots was good and the characters are likeable and well-developed.
1,Formatting is horrible,"This is a scanned in version of a printed book using somesort of OCR program. However, they did not go back and copyedit the book. Just in the first couple of pages there are numerous odd characters and misprinted words which are annoying.There is nothing wrong with OCR, but you need to edit it before you sell it."
5,Let's hear if for the Pooch!,"Observant author, smart dog, great book! Every once and a while one is graced with a conversation that opens the eyes and heart to the goodness in the world around us. Not sentimental, this is a slick read. It will keep you on your toes, it will keep you smiling, it will call you back to the bookstore to buy a copy for someone about whom you care."
2,using with tru oil,"Im finishing my sw1911e grips with tru oil. I got the 3m tack cloth to clean after sanding each layer. The 3m does a good job cleaning the grips but are overly sticky. I have to add another step of buffing off the sticky wax with clean duck cloth before the next layer. Im on the third coat, so far so good."
4,VERY GOOD!!,This was a great book. very little hilighting.. as expected. Otherwise excellent condition! No tears or missing pages!
3,"Playful, but in an irritating way","I see that I'm in the minority here, but this was one Nabokov novel I didn't care for. Hugh Person, hapless editor, has an awful-sounding life and returns to a ski resort town in Switzerland to revisit his past through those ""transparent things"" that let memory through. It turns out Person seems to have sleepwalked through much of his life, not to mention his wife.I suspect Nabokov was having fun with the idea of the rubes who loved Lolita (and there were some, even if none of the readers of this review are included) picking up this book and getting something very different. There's very much a feeling of being deliberately obscure, even when the events described are rather simple. I suspect that this is a great book to read if you're writing a biography of Nabokov and know all the allusions, but other readers are the uninvited.Don't start with this one."
2,Good for the money,At first I had thought this meter was not accurate. But then you must give it at least an hour to acclimate and then it gives much more accurate readings.This is not a bad temperature and humidity meter for the money I wish it did not take so long to get accurate readings.
3,Let us be realistic please,"I, for one, do not support Karl Rove or our current President's policies. However, this book does not endorse those policies nor does it pretend to. The previous reviewers are so aggravated that they can not see past their own ideologies. This book follows the political victories of Republicans in Texas, followed by those of George Bush until 2002. Karl Rove is largely responsible for the Republican wins in Texas; however, the writers carefully assert that the political winds favored Rove in some circumstances. Yet, Rove managed to remove Texas from the Democrats. Anyone who understood Texas before and after Rove does not underestimate ""King Karl"". As one reviewer mentioned the 2000 election, I would point out the book clearly documents Rove's extreme overstatement of Bush's strength in the Electoral College. This book is very well balanced, but the same cannot be said of the reviewers here."
4,interesting read,"I did not think I would like this book as much as I did! This is about a woman from an incrediblely dysfunctional family who also dabbles in witchcraft. People around her die mysteriously, including her mother, who is found in a trash can inside a rented storage shed. It is scary to think people like her and her family could be living and working next to you! The book is fast paced, beginning with the find of the body in the trashcan and following with the usual background family history of the killer. The narrative does not get bogged down in lengthy details and cuts to the chase. It is not your average murder mystery, well worth the read."
4,One whacked witch,"Witch is a riveting read about a woman who undoubtedly killed at least two people - her mother and her former husband. She was never charged in the death of her ex, and she skated several years until the stench from a storage shed where she stashed the body of her mother put authorities on her trail.Puit does a nice job of tracing the steps of Brookey Lee West, a tech writer/marble reader (she claims she can read the future using marbles)/daughter of a satan worshipper.Witch was a quick read - I usually take my time with books, but this tale was compelling enough that I hardly put it down. It is somewhat gorey in spots, but well worth reading if true crime is your thing."
1,NO ONE TO CARE ABOUT,"Due to the description of the perpetrator and the victim(s)which one assumes is all true, one simply does not care about these people. Scumbag killed scumbag(s). How are we supposed to feel sympathy for that? Puit is a little too redundant in his writing. One gets the point, however, Puit pounds away various points at least three times each; perhaps to fill the book. When one does not care about the victim, one does not care about the killer therefore one cannot care about this book. It leaves one feeling polluted after reading about people who never deserved any mention in any book."
1,"Hideous crime, but not worth all the superlatives it advertised.","Actually, a pretty boring book --- not well organized or well written.I wouldn't read it again."
4,good book,"overall, i was happy with the book. the beginning is really slow. the author takes a lot of time giving background information on the detectives; i dont feel this information was necessary. however, when the book started talking about West, it was very interesting. i still wonder what happened to her brother and maybe i missed it but, what happened to her daughter? does West ever get a visit from her daughter?"
1,Unbelieveably boring & irrelevant,"I have read hundreds if not thousands or true crime books. I've been to law school and specifically studied female serial killers. This book is badly written. It is organized poorly. However, ultimately it has a catchy title with no backing. It mentions black magic three or four times and really doesn't dwell on how it deals with the deaths. For that matter, I'm not even sure I'd convict her. She may be crazy but it doesn't mean she isn't crazy like a fox and that undercover work like you see in Ann Rule and Aphrodite Jones books just isn't found here. This is a boring book that I prayed would real some nugget of information (but didn't) before it ended and then literally threw it away--it's not worth the passage to others or even the space on my bookshelf. I had assumed that a professional newspaper journalist with the back ground that this writer has would produce a better book, but it didn't happen."
3,This book - wow twists and turns,This book was great almost as good as September Sacrifices. I only gave it the lower rating because none of the pictures showed up on my kindle fire.
4,"Great fast-paced detective movie, Kiss me Deadly","Kiss me Deadly grabs you by the throat and does not let go until the end of the movie. I saw Ralph Meeker in old Hitchcock show and found this jem of a movie. Seeing Cloris Leechman act in such a desperate role is worth the price of admission.Sometimes the movie gets a little violent, but much visual impact is left to the imagination. I am surprised how much I liked the movie. Anyone is fair game to be shot or killed during the hunt for the special ""prize"". If you are tired of the animated behemoths like Avatar, you will love Kiss me Deadly. Enjoy!"
2,Very disappointing film noir,"As a huge film noir fan who was aware of this film's importance to various directors I admire, I was very interested in seeing this movie and then extremely disappointed by it. Some of the acting is fine but some of it is atrociously bad. The story is preposterous which would be fine if it were more entertaining. And the film as a whole is a big dud. If you're looking for great noir, check out ""Double Indemnity"", ""Chinatown"", ""The Maltese Falcon"" and others. Hell, even rent ""Detour""--low-budget and dated but far superior to this film."
3,A nice guilty pleasure book,"I read this book for the first time many, many years ago. I keep coming back to it. I enjoy the main story, but am not as enamored with the story Ravenna writes. The mixture of Irish history and mythology is just up my alley."
3,Went on for too long,"At first it was really interesting, but I got bored in the middle because it went on for too long and seemed to have a fakey reason they couldn't get together (he wasn't about to let the geis control him.) So I skipped to the end, which of course wasn't any big surprise."
4,Helpful but Dated,"As the author will acknowledge, the tips in this book are basic rhetoric. Anyone with an understanding of rhetoric will not find this book terribly helpful. This work shows it's age and was written for a different time and place with cultural assumptions that are no longer applicable. There is also a lot of blank pages for you to do your own notations, don't let page count fool you."
4,Good book to use on well intentioned family and friends,Everyone has that mom/dad who tells you that they only want the best for you and that is why you should do things just like they tell you to. Everyone has the friend who tells you that you are pretty but could lose some more weight. Everyone has that sibling who tells you how to spend your money and what friends to choose. This book is for them. You want to stand up to them without losing their friendship or hurting their feelings.
4,quality adhesive unlike others I have tried.,It sticks exceptionally well to both the casing and film- its worth paying more for this product than getting cheaper tapes.
2,I was disappointed in the actual contentof the video.,"I was disappointed in the actual contentof the video due to the fact that it was vague and offered little if any advice in the interviewing process. I did feel that the photography was excellent, and that the film had potential, yet lacked the insight-full content"
2,Decent - but not great,"I've owned this headset for almost 4 months now and can't seem to get all the way through a call without someone saying ""I'm only getting every other word - can't hear you very well."" It's pretty frustrating...The earpiece is somewhat comfortable, and I have a few family members who picked up the Voyager Pro - haven't heard any complaints from them yet. Maybe I just got a defective earpiece!"
2,Looks nice but doesn't work as well...,"Nicely designed and I was very eager to enjoy my first Bluetooth experience...But, after a while I learned it's not what it's cracked upto be. I had problem with echo and dropped connections."
4,Over your ear and Away You Go,"My original headset had a thin plastic loop that slipped over the ear. It broke and couldn't find a part. This design has you loop over the ear, decide on ear bud size, select earbud a size smaller so that it can nest in tight and away you go.While it's cumbersome to get in place over your ear (especially with glasses) I love how it's snug allowing me to hear well and stays that way."
3,It's alright,I have not found a bluetooth that works close to perfect yet. This one rates with the rest of them to me. Its not made for small ears. You will have to try it for yourself.
3,Ear too small,"The clarity of a phone call on this little device was great. However, my ear is too small and the headset would not stay on, so I returned it."
1,Short-lived!!,"Bought his and hers pair. Now both no longer work. One failed within a couple months the other after 15 months of infrequent use. Otherwise, we were satisfied with the overall product features and quality. Although, the earpiece is a bit loose fitting which means you have to often reset it closer to your ear to hear."
2,Expected more,I bought this product after several reviews and found it far from acceptable.I thought I could use it to replace my wired headset for my laptop and also use it on my cellphone. Several times during the day I have to remove the driver from my dell laptop and reinstall it. At least a couple times each day I have to restart my phone (Blackberry curve) to make it re-register with the headset as well.I tried to work with it but it has found a resting place in my tech junk heap and I have gone back to my tried and proven wires.
1,toxic disposiable product,"I had Jabra when it first came out, its battery stopped charging after 10 months. So I got this one as a replacement, it too stopped charging after a year. This is the problem with all BT earpieces, its battery is not replaceable which can be done if the industry wants to. They make more money by selling the whole unit vs we pay 5-10 dollars to replace battery. This kind of practice is not sustainable. I'm now back to the wired headset."
2,Hard to turn on and off,"I bought this one, because the rating was high, however I dont like that much personally. It is hard to turn on and off. Think about buying this carefully."
3,Great headset BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE,"I am one of the millions of people that are on a life long quest to procure the ideal bluetooth headset. I went through several before I purchased this Plantronics on Amazon. I bought it because it had such great reviews, not only on Amazon, but on other sites as well. ""How can I go wrong?"" I said to myself. Well unfortunately I did and here is why:The headset really is terrific. BUT the ""in the ear"" design did not work in MY ear. There are 3 different pads you can attach to the set to get it to fit correctly, none worked. For the 30 seconds it stayed in my ear, it would work great. Loud, clear volume, then the ear bud would fall out. Every time. With ALL of the ear buds.Bottom line is that this is a great headset as the 200 other people on Amazon have attested, just beware if your ears are not based on the mold Plantronics used to make the ear buds.Now, I must continue in my quest for the ideal headset. Next stop: Motorola H710."
2,Doesn't have it where it really counts,"Comfort, battery life, sleek look: yes, yes, yes. But this headset doesn't have it where it really counts -- reception. I used it with a Treo 650, which should be as good as any phone for Bluetooth signal, but even 3-4' away I got complaints on sound quality (""underwater"", ""crackly"").I also noticed that people couldn't hear me if they were talking (maybe I shouldn't interrupt, but this isn't a review of my phone habits). The microphone is quite sensitive, so I had to use the foam mic cover whenever I was outdoors.I can deal with not interrupting and foam mic covers, but I was disappointed enough with the reception that I have sent it back to Amazon."
4,blue tooth,"I am very happy with the product; the clarity of the calls is excellent. If I had one complaint, the product sometimes slips off my ear."
1,Very poor quality microphone.,"The earpiece works well. You can hear the other parties on your call very well. HOWEVER, the microphone is really quite poor. To the person(s) on the other end of your call, your voice will sound very muffled. Not worth the purchase price."
4,wonderful product,"plantronics 510 review..great product.. ive gone through 2 previous bt headsets, the motorola? 700 and jabra headset and both were spotty fresh out of the box.the plantronics is well built, abit obtrusive considering the plethora ofother bt headsets out there but I CAN hear what people say when that thing is on.. most other headsets make you believe the volume goes up when you press the up button but to me, volume sound never improves or increases.the plantronics is easy to use, the buttons are easy to get to, pairing was a breeze, and if I had a land line I would pair it up with that..great product, well made and well worth the money i spent. I wish I had purchased it sooner then later and not made all the mistakes and gotten grief with trying to figure out what i didnt like about the others.good luck"
4,Great Headset,"We have two, and we love them. They work very well, like much better than the Motorola's we had, and these are quite stylish and unobtrusive. Now, I will say that I switch back and forth between the smallest ear piece and none at all - with it, it fits better and you can hear better, but it starts hurting a little after a while, have to take a break; without it, I can wear it all day, but, it dangles a little awkwardly and sound is sacrificed, a little, but certainly bearable."
3,Just OK product..,"The product might be great years ago, but not great anymore if compare with the latest BT headset.First, the ear hook is a little bit big to me so it's easy to fall off. Second, the shinning blue light is a bit annoyed in the night and this phone doesn't have noise canceling.The worst, when I got this product, it seemed like a refurbished one to me cause there are scratches on the body... just didn't feel good."
1,eh...love to find a decent bluetooth headset,"This product has a great ear piece. It is comfortable and the sound quality out is great. The microphone on the other had is horrible. I've tried two of these and both are bad.For once I'd like to find a decent bluetooth. From the other reviews, I was hoping this was it, but no luck. Personally I'd advise against purchasing this product. If you want, I have one for sale...cheap!"
5,Very good product,"This is an excellent mic. I use it for my playstation 3 and no one has problems hearing me and I can hear them perfectly. I've read other reviews saying it breaks if you swivel it the wrong way. I got a great solution, don't swivel it the wrong way! I mean seriously it's not that complicated. If you have an iq over 50 I suggest you get it. I've had it for about a year and it still works perfectly."
1,Lemon? Who knows...,"All I know is that this product didn't work for me. I've heard some things about ""lemons"" in circulation, so maybe the one I ordered was a lemon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product and taking the risk, though. The quality was not terrible, and the product was easy to set up, but it was bad enough that, on a voice recognition menu, the computer thought I said Español when I said English. Simply not usable."
1,Not compatible with Palm Treo 680,"Nothing but static. Could have been a solvable technical problem, but I did not want to deal with technical issues from the outset. What I really wanted was hands-free, not necessarily wireless, so I used the hands-free headset supplied with the Treo and am satisfied with that."
5,Great for a two phone user,"Reasonable noise reduction but the main reason I use it is that I carry two cell phones and it syncs with both of them! I don't care where you look, that's hard to find. It is a bit bulky when dropped in a shirt pocket but I usually loop the ear piece over a button on my shirt. Good battery life, both talk and standby time. I can eventually destroy almost anything but it should tell you something that when my first one died, I went back to Amazon and ordered a replacement for next day delivery."
5,Wonderful Product,"I like the look of the device, even though some others don't seem to think its very stylish I didn't have any problems with aesthetics. The unit functions wonderfully with my LG VX8300 despite some issues with the phones Bluetooth incompatability (which is unrelated to the actual headset itself). Very loud, I rarely can ever turn the volume all the way up except when I talk to my mother who doesn't have a very good phone.I would definitely suggest this product to anyone who is looking for a product that is reliable, easy to set up, and functional."
4,calling in the wind,"This is my second headset.I am very happy that none of the problems of my first head set are present:My first one was a a motorola s9 stereo headset, that had choppy bluetooth connection, on which I could not hear my surrounding, since it covered both of my ears, and through which people could not hear my voice clearly, since the microphone was on my ear.With this plantronics Voyager 510 headset people can clearly hear me, even if I am riding my bike in the wind and in rush hour. I can also hear people on the phone even in noisy environment, although for that I have to turn the volume to maximum.Unfortunately the lawn mover's noise is too much for me and this headset to handle."
5,"affordable, gets the job done",Using this unit with Skype (Mac OS X) and a Nokia phone. Works great with both without problems and switches dynamically back-and-forth (after initial pairing/setup). Some static when it gets separated from the device. Comfortable to wear. Great for the price!
4,Great bluetooth earpiece!!,"Works really well overall. On my end, it is loud and clear. The only negative is that the person you are talking w/ over the voyager headset can hear all of your background noise. So if you are in a crowded place, it can be hard for them to hear what you are saying."
5,Truck Drivers Favorite!!!!,"So i actually got this headset for my pop, he is a truck driver and he has had one of these before. After having his original peace for a little over a year and looking as if he had ran it over with his truck a couple of times it gave out. He asked me if i could purchase him the exact same model because of the great sound quality and battery life it has. Needless to say i bought it for him as a gift and he is one happy trucker! Not only that but the price was great and the shipping was pretty fast."
2,High rating - low quality,I bought this due to the good reviews on this website and have had numerous complaints from business associates and family that my voice is muffled and hard to hear with this headset. I have had better success with my cheaper Motorola.
4,Works Great With Room for Improvement,"This headset is very comfortable sometimes I forget I'm even wearing it! The voice quality is rich, full and very clear it's hard to believe this set is wireless! Here's the rundown:Pros:-Comfortable and fits securely.-Superb voice quality.-Mic with noise-cancellation technology.-Elegant design.Cons:-Hard to press on/off button.-Controls take time to get used to.-Voice-dialing doesn't work in semi-noisy environments.Overall, this is an awesome piece! Now I just have to watch I don't talk over my 1,500 minutes!"
4,excellent sound,"i love this one better than other brand. so far works great , loud n clear, with noise cancelation technology."
2,Amazon buying defective products???,"This is the second time I have had a Voyager 510. The first one I had was a 5 star product but I lost it at a construction site. This one seems like a ""Blue Light Special"" from KMart. Tons of static and even makes random noises at random times. It seems like Amazon just bought a bunch of dirt cheap defects and sold them at discount prices. Very disapointed in the product this time around. I would recommend this product, maybe just not from Amazon."
4,A Good Buy,Was able to buy this for a pretty good price. Connected it to my phone without trouble. It is a little big but I like the pickup on it. My wife says the sound produced is a lot cleaner than my old bluetooth headset.
1,Poor,"I ordered three of these from Amazon and 2 of them did not work. The one that did work was fine. When I called they told me it was a ""dead unit"" and I could return them for a replacement."
3,Bluetooth,It wouldn't work if the phone and the Bluetooth were more than ten feet apart. The pairing was not as bad but many times it would disconnect one line or the other
3,"High quality sound, missing an important feature","I really like the sound quality of the headset. The sound is very clear both outgoing and incoming. However, I found out the hard way that the headset is not equipped to use the call waiting feature. I have hung up on several people expecting to be transferred to an incoming call. Also, on occasion, the headset will transfer the sound back to the phone for no apparent reason."
5,Plantronics Rocks,My husband has this ear piece and he loves it. He is a truck driver and he said this ear piece does everything it is suppose to do. And I can always hear him even when he is in his loud truck. this is a wonderful product and when driving you can keep your hands on the wheel.
3,I have to repeat myself...,"I chose this for the decent reviews and for the bargain price. My big problem with the Voyager is while I can hear people very clearly, but I find myself repeating myself because the outgoing sound is muffled and distant. However, it was very easy to connect to my phone and the the talk time is ok, but certainly could be better. I'd pay more for a bluetooth if I could be guaranteed decent sound clarity in both directions and a longer talk-time."
4,Love this headset!,"This was given to me as a gift after others had tried different Motorola headsets. I love it!! It has worked well since I received it a year ago, never have issues with people hearing me. I only wish it was easier to sync between two phones, but that could just be the way bluetooth works (I'm oblivious to this technology). I highly recommend it!"
2,doesn't work well with the Jabra BT adapter,"I have a Sanyo 8200 cell phone using this headset with the Jabra BT adapter.However, like the other reviewer using the Jabra Bluetooth adapter, I had major problems with the transmitted voice. The adapter and headset connected fine and lasted a long time battery-wise, and on my end, the sound quality was excellent.BUT, the transmitted voice quality was very poor. My friends reported that they were only getting portions of the conversation with a lot of background noise and echoes. Therefore, this headset is useless.I am very disappointed."
4,good product,"Researched until blue in the face and settled on the 510. I needed a set that I could hear with a noisy background and this set performs well. Sometimes I get a loud chirp in the set, which is irritating, otherwise, it works well and fits right."
2,Good While It Lasted,"I purchased my voyager 510 based on the exceptional reviews on Amazon. It worked well the first week, but after the second charge it started making a popping noise and cutting in and out during calls. People I spoke with using the headset told me that it sounded as though I was in a wind tunnel.Likes:- Comfortable and light.- In ear design which makes calls in noisy places possible.- Long battery life.Dislikes:- Bulky and difficult to carry if you are not wearing it.- Tiny power button. I wish it was easy to turn on and off like the Motorola HS850.- Poor quality."
5,Love this li'l babe,did a lot of customer review reading for a bluetooth earpiece before deciding that this is the one. The clarity is pretty good for close range and starts deteriorating at about 20ft...It was pretty easy to setup with my motorola v330 and I also paired it with my compaq v2000 to do internet voice chats. The results have been very satisfactory. The best thing I like about this device is the comfort. Its been designed very well to sit over the ear and the different sizes of ear plugs provided means that you can choose the one that fits your ear the best. Definitely recommend people to buy this product.Update: After 3 months of use the ear bud tore off....don't know if I used it rough or if it was just bad. So right now I am using it without the bud....sound quality and receptions are still excellent is a definite keeper for me
2,performs ok but very ugly!,"the product works as expected. however, it looks really out of style. I do not wanna look like I am wearing a hearing device. I returned this product and replaced it with Jabra BT8040.. couldn't be happier...."
2,"great sound, drive you crazy connectivity issues","I had this for a couple of months and while people I talked to said the sound is good and I could also hear them, the frustrating issue was the thing would connect to the phone half the time and not the other half (treo 650). I checked the manuals and did everything right, even powered off and on between calls like it said to do, but it made me so frustrated. The infrequency of it made me enraged. It seemed as if it was deciding for me who it would let me talk to and whom it wouldn't. I reached my peak of frustration and said enough is enough."
4,Great Headset!!!,"I really love this headset, it's the first one that friends told me didn't sound muffled or distorted. It feels comfortable as well and turning it off and on is easy. My phone is also an MP3 player and the music sounds pretty good through it. All-in-all this is a really good buy."
2,bad audio quality,"It is hard to turn on and off and the sound quality is terrible. Everything is distorted, no matter how low the volume. I would not recommend this product."
4,"Uhura, Contact the Federation","Nothing is more Star Trek than wearing these earphones. Light, comfortable, easy to use, good sound, bug free, nice battery life. Like others, I find the buttons nearly useless, and tolerate only the off/on on, other functions I prefer working from my Motorola phone buttons. The accuracy by which the Moto phone interprets voice commands is incredible, and I spend 90% of my time coordinating calls by voice commands.Microphone output is superb. At times the earpiece crackles like a dirty connector ... most commonly when traveling by car. At home its solidly clear. The voices of callers are very clear, albeit softly muffled and lacking frequency response, like a very compressed MP3 file. It may sound like Uncle Bob has a cold but you can make out everything he says.Your only question is do you need one of these. I didn't but Ms. Christmas said I did."
4,Plantronics 510 Bluetooth,I like the way the bluetooth fits snug around my ear. It is not bulky like others. Sound quality is not as clear as I would like but it is decent.
2,Doesnt work as good as other plantronic ones Ive owned,"Goes in and out even if phone is right next to you. When it is working its very clear and sounds great, however it wont keep connected to the phone. You can have phone right next to you and it will jump from phone to bluetooth constantly. Maybe I just have a bad one ..so dont base your decision on one review. I have had several ones from this brand and they have been GREAT! When this one does work its sounds great so maybe just a defect."
1,irritating,"This works but the geniuses at Plantronics put a flashing blue light alongside your laptop, so plan on ducttaping it, unless you like this thoughtless distraction."
3,One small problem,"I found this headset to be very comfortable, great sound, and fantastic battery life. The only issue I had with it is the charging pin on the bottom kept braking. This renders the unit useless. I went through 3 units. The first one broke off after 3 months, the 2nd was within 1 month and the last was a little more than 3 months again. Amazon was great they replaced or refunded for all of the units, (after the 3rd I bought the Voyager Pro), With no questions or problems. I have a co worker that has 510 also and he hasn't had an issue so I'm not sure what was happening. At some point when I would unplug the charger from the unit the pin would be stuck in the charger. I have read a few reviews that talked about poor battery life. Ill bet if you look at the bottom of the unit you would see the pin is missing."
4,"Durable, works well, range could be better","The 510 is very durable and comfortable to wear. I have just two minor complaints with it: 1) the on off button is very small and somewhat difficult to press 2) the range could be better - it starts to get pretty scratchy when i go into the other room of my relatively small apartment. Otherwise, I think it's a great little device."
4,SOUND investment,Have used other Bluetooth devices and this one is by far the best sound and comfort for the price. People complane about wind in cars and such. Well that problem happens with use of a cell phone by its self. This unit delivers great sound and clear comunication to your callers ear.
4,"Great price, product with limitations","This product is light weight with great sound qualities. The weakness of the product is the battery life and not knowing when it will give out. We called the Plantronics and they said the battery is good for about a year. As a mobile professional, a light or battery life meter visible to the user would allow us time to purchace a new headset since these batteries can't be replaced. Have the headset go out and not being able to use it while traveling is a pain. With all the new laws regulating driving and speaking on cell phones mandates that we have a bluetooth that works all the time. Solution, make the battery replaceable by the user."
2,"Annoying To Use, Buzzing Sound, Poor Quality","After so many great reviews, I figured this would be a good choice. It is not. The power button is very annoying to turn on. When using it, there is a clear buzzing noise, even when the phone is close by or in my pocket. The switching is slow, which cuts people off and with my Treo, the voice command doesn't work. If and was to do it again, I would NOT purchase this product. I got two - yes TWO different headset that were defective - before Amazon sent me another to correct the mistake. It works, but when it's not convenient to use, it's pretty much useless.DISSAPOINTED IN PLANTRONICS!!"
1,"Poor Unit, Horrendous Plantronic Customer Service","Based on the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I selected this unit for my husband's use. Despite the advertising, the unit was horribly noisy, AND the itty-bitty buttons made it difficult to use. BUT, that's not the worst part of it. Six weeks-- that's how long it lasted. SIX WEEKS! If I wanted a disposable, I would have spent $5-- not $80. Highly recommend looking at other options. Ps. Plantronic Customer Service rates zero stars. JUST DON'T DO IT."
2,Disappointed,"After browsing all the glowing reviews for this headset, I bought one to pair with my residential phone, a Motorola V3m and a UTStarcom ""Super Slice,"" which I use for my startup business. The 510 constantly drops the V3m signal, even when it's in my pants pocket on the same side. Plantronics informed me there was a problem with the Razrs and to turn off Battery Save. I did so, and I still lose the Bluetooth signal. And now my Razr battery drains in a day.I'll be returning this product and replacing it with another. I doubt I'll purchase Plantronics again because of their dismal support."
4,I'm Pleased,"With over 3,000 other reviews, I'm not sure I can add much. The price was attractive and so far I have no complaints. I can hear and be heard. I mostly use it inside a vehicle or building so I can't speak to its performance outside or in the wind. I would have given this 5 stars had Plantronics included the same silicon earpieces that my Plantronics headset at work has. I did a swap and felt the silicon earpiece significantly enhanced the fit."
1,"Static, difficult to use, slow response time","After reading glowing reviews, I figured I'd finally found a decently priced BT headset to replace my crappy Verizon cheapie. No such luck. It turned out to be worse than the $20 one from Verizon. Many people I talked with complained of static, strange electronic sounds, and faintness. I found it difficult to get in place quickly, which is important to me because I don't walk around with it all the time. The side control that allows you to enter commands verbally, or that lets you know your dialing is being registered, is slow on the uptake compared to the Verizon one. Also, I found I had to take it off the change the volume because the control is non-ergonomic and non-intuitive to touch. Finally, I hate its bulk. The verizon one was lighter and smaller and a lot easier to place. Wish I hadn't let the return period expire."
4,Plantronics Voyager 510,"So far, I am pleased with this headpiece. Indoors, the range is good. Sometimes, there is considerable static when I'm outdoors and on the move. Otherwise, when I'm driving or at home, when I use it the most, the quality is good."
3,Returned.,"Well, I ordered this headset based on all the positive reviews and the product being rated #1 in bluetooth headset sales. When i got it, it looked really old and out of style(the design, not the product). The headset was huge!! A lot bigger than i thought judging from the pictures. I am sure it works great like many people said, but it just looks outdated."
1,Magnifies road noise,"This Bluetooth was a huge and expensive disappointment. When I am talking to people they complain that the volume is too loud and the road noise is terrible. There are no controls for reducing the outbound volume. If you buy it, test it before you leave the store."
3,jury is still out,"I have been using the Plantronics Voyager 510 for a couple of weeks and am not as excited about it as I would like to be. It is hard to answer incoming calls- I have lost several learning how best to do it and at times outside the clarity is not good. I hope this gets better, otherwise I will be looking at other options."
3,Depends on use,"The Plantronics Voyager 510 bluetooth headset does seem to work well in the house or office with the phone very close by. Sound clarity is good, there is plenty of volume control and it is comfortable to wear. A person with small ears though will not be able to wear this headset because of it's bulky size. This headset does not work well outside or in a car as it tends to pick up too much background noise."
3,"With all the great reviews, I am dissapointed",The unit has plenty of volume and I am very pleased with battery life.I have an iPhone and the phone can not be in my pocket or inside my bag. If it is then I get a lot of static and is not usable.If I was willing to spend the extra money I should have gotten a Jawbone.
4,"Overall, I'm happy","I've tried several Bluetooth devices and I am more happy with the Plantronics Voyager 510 than with others. I can hear people clearly, and they can hear me. I am disappointed in the way I make calls. I always have to manually transfer the call to the Bluetooth, rather than it going to the device automatically. Overall, I am happy with this product."
5,GREAT,Great product...I researched bluetooth headsets for about a month and this seemed to be the best one...I was not let down. The sound is great and is very comfortable..I recommend this to anyone
3,OK,"This product works ok. Like most headsets it needs an earbud type earpiece that seals out external noise. I was always holding it against my head to hear in the car which sort of negates its value. also like most of these headsets the volume needs to be about two notches higher if they do not provide ear buds. It is easy to use and has good distance , never loses contact... just does not seal."
4,"Good usability, fits nicely, battery won't last long",I have been using this headset for 2-3 weeks now and have not any major complaints. I earlier had Motorola Bluetooth Headset - i used it almost for 2 years before it stopped working well. I bought this one just because it had good reviews and a good offer.The Good:At first look it looks bulky but it is not. has great reception. Sound quality is also good. won't catch much of noise.The Bad:Battery life is less. it is annoying at times when you see its light blinking red just next day morning after you get it charged.Rest is pretty much good.
5,good one,"This works very good I am happy with this Item. I tried those MotorolaH500, H700, and few more, This is the best one I liked. I am using this with my RAZER V3. The ear piece sit perfectly in the ear and the rest fit exactly behind the ear. No problem switching between Left or Right ear."
5,Comfortable with GREAT sound!,"This headset is somewhat large but is very comfortable, stays on my ear and the sound quality is excellent!Also has very good battery life.Highly recommended!!!"
3,It's alright...,"The sound coming out from the headset is kind of soft, and the fit of the headset is somewhat loose."
4,satisfied,"got this in the mail yesterday, havent used it to much but so far so good. im very satisfied by its comfort and ease of use.Power button is not hard to press, i find it easy and convenient enough not to accidently press it.Different colors would b good.Could b a little smaller. but not if it would compromise the technology.Have LG VX9800 the V. Voice dialing works only if u press the button on the phone first. and no mp3 will not play thru bluetooth.Gave it only 4 stars because of those two things, but i am a very satisfied amazon customer and voyager510 owner."
4,Great product. Easy to use.,"I purchased this headset about a year ago and have been very pleased with it. It pairs up well and has a good amount of range before it unpairs - oftentimes much further than the 30ft advertised.It does not offer the noise reduction I expected (hence the 4 stars). Otherwise it is great.I have not tried the voice dialing, but everything I have done works well."
1,Disappointment,"This product is hard to turn on. The sound is very distorted and breaks up. The people on the other end can't hear you at all. I returned this item, as it was useless."
5,Excellent product!!!,"This is a great headset. The set up is very easy and it is easy to use. I live in the South and wear sunglasses year round, the headset sits on my ear easily even with my sunglasses. I am a woman and so I wear sunglasses that have wider arms and have no problems with comfort or with it shifting. The sound quality is excellent and it's easy to push the various buttons on the headset while it is on your ear. You can also easily shift the arm of the mic and the ear piece in order to switch it from left ear to right ear.All around a great product and I highly recommend it."
2,Delayed Reaction,"After reading so many good reviews for this item, and trying more than 5 different Bluetooths for my Treo 755p, I was ready to be impressed by this Plantronics. Ho Hum. It's as good as any others I tried but it seems like half the time there's a good ten second delay before it switches over, and the switch over period itself is a good 2 seconds. On the plus side, I had the fewest complaints about the sound quality. At this point I'm resigned to the fact that it may well be my cell phone, not Bluetooth that is the issue. So if you want to buy it go ahead, but if you've tried many others for your device, this might not be the Holy Grail you're looking for. Sigh."
4,Useful,"This headset looks stylish, works well. And what more would you need from a product.I use it with my iPhone and it works like a charm. It however did not work with my Samsung Trace phone. A list of phone compatibility woul've been useful.There are three ear buds of different sizes with the headset which gives flexibility. But I wish there was a guide giving the size/dimensions of these buds and compatibility with your ear (type).I was however disappointed with the shipping. I was promised a 7-day delivery and I received it 2 weeks after I placed the order. The catch was that they shipped it only after a week or so since I ordered it."
4,bluetooth headset,I like this product alot. It is very lite and comfortable on your ear. Sound quality is excellent. I have tried other models and this one is much better.
2,Annoying,"I bought this headset based on the opinions I read here, and now wish I hadn't. I have had so much trouble with this thing, it loses it's link up with my phone way too often. For example, in a 20 minute call, it will switch back and forth 4-5 times. I bought it to drive with, and sometimes I have to hold my phone to my head on one side, and have this thing in my other ear. Trying to drive like that makes me wonder why they called this thing ""Voyager"".I can also get an echo, and it also seems to amplify background noise at times, which gets annoying during a call because it comes and goes, regardless of being in a relatively quiet environment.The highs one this thing are great...when it works the way you think it should, it's fantastic. When this thing acts up, you want to chuck it out the window."
5,Good Product,"I have been using this product for about 2 months. This product is amazing with good phone reception and good connection with the phone. During windy climate, the reception is still good. Overall this is an excellent product and I had a very good transaction as usual with Amazon.com"
5,No More Wire Hangers!,"Well, ok, not wire hangers, but no more wires/cords dangling from my ears. Love the wireless bluetooth headset. Great price. Great product. Great sound quality."
5,Great headset and great customer service.,This is my favorite headset to date. I bought this brand new and it came fast.
2,Complaints of volume from the other end.,"I was able to adjust to everything else on this headset (weight, difficulty of wearing and the unusable power button) but every now and then the person at the other end only hears a faint voice even when I am talking at the top of my voice. Not sure what the problem is but it's quite annoying. I am not using this one anymore and am off to try some of those motorola ones.My review should be taken with a pinch of salt given that this is the only headset I have ever had. Not sure if others are better/worse than this. But this is the only problem I have with this headset. I am using this with a Motorola-Razor V3."
4,"Great product, but check compatibility with your phone","Product works beautifully, but has some compatibility problems with the Treo 700wx. In its defense the 510 is not listed by Treo as a compatible device. But it works well except for some reconnection issues."
5,razr bluetooth,This is great. Not a single problem. Hearing is great & I am told that I can be heard without a problem.
2,"Started Out Great, Did Get Static....BUT...","I bought two of them, one for my wife. Both of them worked great at first then slowly started to go bad. Sound quality started to get a little static, then a lot, then wouldn't even be audible unless you held the cell phone right next to the Headset. Too bad because I really liked the ""Low Profile"" look, less ""Geeky"". BUT... what a warrantee! With a 1 year warrantee just go to their Web Site and request a replacement, no questions asked! The replacement arrives in 48 hours..WOW! I'm happy again!"
4,the best one ever,this the only one you need. it has the best sound. the only thing is the battery life is a little short.all in all it is a 8.5 out 10
5,Excellent Product,"People I talk with tell me how clear I sound now vs. the Jabras I was using before. Even with glasses, these work great and actually are more comfortable then the Jabra."
3,Planetronics is OK,"This product is OK, I am quite happy with the sound quality and volume That I hear and the headset is comfortable to wear. Often times though folks at the other end complain about sound quality / volume. Lynking with a Blackberry 8800 phone works very well."
5,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology,The sound from this headset is very clear both way. It is comfortable to wear over the ear. I can use this headset with Skype on my computer.A little bit complicated to switch from my mobile to computer.
3,good and bad,its a reallly good bluetooth headset.. but it doesnt work well with samsung t809.. if i keep the phone in my pocket.. the voice starts distorting... works well for my friend who has a SONY.. no probs at all...
5,This Bluetooth can't be beat,"The Plantronic Windsmart Voyager 510 is almost perfect. It beats out any of other Bluetooth products out there. The Windsmart technology is a lifesaver when you are outside. The noise cancellation feature is wonderful no matter where you are. The sound is crystal clear and no one ever has trouble hearing me. It sets up in seconds and it is incredibly easy to switch from my cell phone handset to the Plantronic 510 headset. I didn't find that to be the case with my prior Plantronic Bluetooth products. The earpiece, with the different size earpieces should solve the problem of a good ear fit. It is much more comfortable to wear and not think about than my prior Plantronic products. I can't see where you will be disappointed with this one."
3,Good Bluetooth,"This is the 4th 510 bluetooth I have owned all have worked great. I drive a truck and I have had no problem hearing or the other people hearing me. This certian one I have trouble hearing people, don't know what it is. I have ordered at least 10 for other drivers and they have had no problem."
2,Plantronics blue tooth,I found this product to be just ok. It does the job but the controls aren't placed or sized very well. The earpiece feels much looser than I thought it would be. I have to hold it in place with one hand to be able to hear what the caller is saying. I've put it away in a drawer I don't plan to use it much.
4,"Great headset, but not easy to put on",I bought this headset to use in while driving. The connection is really good. I have small ears and it was always a problem for me to find a headset or earphones. Luckily this headset has 3 different pieces to fit in your ear. The only problem is that it is hard to put it on although very comfy afterwards. Recommended.
3,ok product,"I lost my motorola H710 and thought i'd buy a new bluetooh that might be a bit better. This Voyager is ok, the sound quality is not as good though and it is huge compared to the smaller motorola. The best thing about this ear piece is that the battery lasts forever."
4,I really like this product,"I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it. I haven't used all of the features yet, but the voice quality is great on both ends. It does block out the wind noise with the windows down, so I tried it with my convertible down, that didn't work so well. It's more comfortable to wear than the previous bluetooth that I had. Overall, I would recommend this product."
3,Plantronics Bluetooh Voyager 510 review,"The Plantronics Voyager 510 is easy to pair to the Cell phone.There three ear tips of different size that come with the phone. I installed one that was a little to large for my ear. I could not remove the tip I installed, no matter how many times I tried to remove it, so Iam stuck with the original tip installed. Sound quality is O.K., but not as good as my Samsung Cell phone. In a very noisey place or on a noisey street, I switch to my Cell phone. Sound is O.K. in a Supermarket."
3,Too big for petite women's ear,"I like idea I got from the pic, that is placed around your ear, unlike other Bluetooth handset. Unfortunately I am a petite woman. The earloop is just too big and it keep falling off. Not comfy either when you're driving and wearing sunglasses. My husband hate it. Not a surprise as he hate everything re cellphone. He came from old conservative generation anyway.Yup, there should be better technology somehow so we could talk while driving. Something not too big, comfy and not too complicated. It should pretty soon thou...Re noise/wind cancelling it is working great I believe compare to others. I was walking at the mall, the loudspeaker in the mall was on, but the person on the other side did not even hear a thing. Also one time I tried it at the bathroom, talking with my husband, he did not hear anthing either. That's my review. I still have it, just wait for better one to come on the market I guess."
2,Very noisy.,"I had this one for several month. I purchased this one because it fits in my ear firmly. When I use this in enclosed room, or in a car, it works very well. But it is terrible when I am outside. Everyone ask me if I am in wind-tunnel. I had to turn with my cell phone (motorola) only few inches away.Plus when I have my phone on left hip, headset on my right ear, the other end people again complaints.The noisy problem is getting worse and worse that I had to trash it."
5,Best headset,After trying some other bluetooth headsets that were unusable in noisy enviroments such as Walmart;the others didn't work in even the slightest wind.I went for the best and bought this due to good reviews here at Amazon.I wasn't disapointed.This is the only headset I've ever had that actually has such good sound that you can play music through it and it will sound good to the other party on the other end.Because of the noise canceling features it uses more battery power but it last way longer than the charge on my phone.Many times I will use all my charge and have to plug my phone into the car cord;so it last plenty long for me.The other Blue tooth headsets(one by the same manufacturer with out noise cancel)were untolerable to me as well as to those I spoke to.Also the range is much better with this one;I can actually go into the next room with this.I love it.
1,Problem with Plantronics technical support -,"My plantronics 510 continously looses bluetooth connection to my Motorla phone. Technical support from Plantronics support says the problem is with my phone. I told them I 've tried other Bluetooth headsets and devices without this issue. They refused to even examine my Plantronics for any do defects. I had a case opened with Plantronics and was dealing with a very arrogant support peron IMHO. I am not one to roll a person or product under the bus , but I never had such rude support. btw it was not overseas support. Go figure."
5,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology,"PRO'S: The best bluetooth headset ever. Easy to use with very clear instructions. Sound quality is clear and volume adjustable to fit your needs. Very comfrotable to wear for long periods of time, you my forget you have it on. Multiple attachments to fit any size ear.CON'S: NONE"
2,WAY too big for my ears!,"I'm a woman, 5 foot 5 inches, with normal-sized ears. (2.25 inches at it's widest point (from the helix to the lobule) and probably 1.50 inches where the phone should wrap around the ear (the outside of the concha). I found this product to be waaay too big. I never got to try it out for sound once I determined it was too big. Alcohol wipe and a quick return!"
2,A bit disappointing,"I was excited to finally get an ear piece that would allow me to be hands free. I choose this item because of reviews and brand rep. But I was diappointed. I could hear everything just fine and it was easy to use, but the callers on the otherside said there was a lot of static on the line. They had difficulty hearing me. When I went back to just using the phone, everyone could hear me sans static. So...this plantronics sits up on a shelf collecting dust. In retrospect, I should have gotten one of the other ear devices."
5,Perfect out of the box!,"Sound quality is great, the fit is great, simple setup with phone and computer... I'm very happy so far."
2,Ear Piece is not secured to headset,"I have no issues with sound quality or battery life. Aside from occasional interference from microwave ovens and other unknown sources, the sound quality has been good.Unfortunately, the ear piece is not secured to the headset and frequently falls off when I pick up, attach, or remove the headset from my ear. Since it is small and somewhat round, it bounces and rolls all over the place. Plus, I frequently use this in my car, so every time it falls off it sends me crawling on my hands and knees to try to find it.I am thinking of using a hot glue gun to attach the ear piece more securely; has anybody else tried that? I figure I will lose about one ear piece every month until I can find a way to attach it better."
4,Good but not the best,"I'm still using this device, so I wont complain much. But its starting to fall apart so I'm not 100% happy with it. Sound quality is very good. Its very easy on the ears and the weight is just right. Connectivity is nice as well. I used this on my phone, on my laptop with skype. So its a good for day to day use. But I think its a bit expensive for its functions. But if you can afford it and if you really need a plantronics device, then this will fit you. But please search more you might be able to find better for a lesser price."
3,Not the best but still beter than moto,"I just got my v510 and learned quickly that the buttons like many of the reveiws said are very hard to operate. I have a razor v3 phone and it doesn't seem to work very well with it. I have to push the voice dial button on my phone in order to make voice dialed calls which is inconveinent, the connect button on my doesn't connect very well. I got this hoping to be totally handsfree and its not! This is the reason I am giving it a 3. The sound quality is good and the clairty of calls is great, again better then my moto bluetooth device. Its very comfortable also. It almost has more cons than pros. It paired up with my phone easily but again not total hands free. I don't know that I would buy another even though the clarity, wind reduction feature and over all comfort of the device was good."
5,Very Pleased,This is my first headset and I am very pleased with it. The over the ear design is comfortable and the battery life is excellent. Everyone says that my voice comes through clearly and there is no problem hearing callers. It works great with my Verizon Samsung phone.
4,"""Does the job"" multipoint headset at decent price","My first Bluetooth headset. Looked for something in mid/low price range (i.e. 40$ rather than 100$ range), supported my Nokia and had to be multipoint - I want to was a softphone on my laptop also.Pro: All in all a good purchase: Does the job, Good voice quality, Easy setup.Con: Power button hard to access and useI did have a problem pairing it to my laptop until I replaced Microsoft's stack with IBM's, but I guess that is not related to the headset. Also when changing pairing (i.e. between mobile and laptop) I have to power off and on the headset."
4,Ear Fit Is Not Good But....,"I have this Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset and I like it except for one thing. The fit over the ear is terrible. I don't know if it's my ear or a bad design for the ear but I can never get it right. When I receive a call, I will miss the call by trying to get the headset over my ear because it takes so long. I usually have to answer holding it to my ear and telling the caller to hold on while I'm trying to get the headset fitted over my ear. I still will recommend it though. maybe you won't have the problem I'm having getting it to fit over your ear. Just be advised that the fit might be a problem.Nathaniel C"
4,Nice value for money,"This is a pretty good piece for its price value equation. In fact, but for its on-off switch which needs to be pressed too hard and is not smooth this product may have rated even higher. If you are wearing this product on your ears, you cannot switch it on or off - you have to remove it. I have used other Plantronics headset and this function has been better in cheaper headsets too."
4,"Great Functions, a little too big","Excellent working headset. Syncs easily. Just a little too bigh given the pace of technology, it should be much smaller."
1,Hang a lead weight from your ear,"Consumer Reports must be loosing it. Why they recommended the Plantronics 510 I will never understand. This unit is not just heavy it is so big, one would have to have Dumbo ears to use it. I would return it if I could."
1,Very Disappointed,"I received the headset about two weeks ago. The headset fits fine, paired rather easily but the sound quality is horrible. I'm using it with a VX8300 LG phone and here are the things I have found:- The noise reduction doesn't work at all, people tell me there's all sorts of background noise.- When I call people they often cannot hear me."
2,Not satisfied,"I just recently purchased my voyager and was forced to return it after 1 week because of the number of complaints regarding poor transmission sound quality. I have used other plantronics bluetooths before but I must admit this one let me down.On the plus side, pairing was as easy as can be and using the volume and control buttons did not pose any difficulty."
4,bluetooth headset review,"For a technology-challenged person who is looking to avoid a ticket for driving while using a cellphone, this was a great purchase. Set-up was easy and the headset works fine. Buttons are small and using them while driving is tricky. Battery lasts at least 4 hours of talking on a single charge. If you just want an over the ear bluetooth that gives good sound in both directions, the Voyager 510 is a good choice."
4,"Actually, a 4.5 stars is better !","First of all, no matter the bad reviews as they vastly outnumbered by the good ones.Yes, there are lemmons out there, but you can get them even you buy a Caddylac, people, get over it: you just had bad luck.I had another model (without the boom) which my wife has now.This is why I like it and recommend:- it has the mic boom: I want the functionality- fits much better and doesn't dangle all the time. (what a relief)- battery life is amazing- sound quality is very good- very flexible, allows for infinite adjustmentsThe drawbacks pale in comparison with the performance and quality but there are a few minors:- cumbersome power on/off button- very flexible, sometimes makes it difficult to fit using only one handFor those of us who wear glasses, it doesn't play very well with the glasses legs but you can manage it... (or go with contacts haha)Seriously, this is a great piece of equipment.Recommended anytime."
2,Noise Cancel and Lag and Bad Sync,"The sound is good on my end, and a lot of people say it's better than just my cell phone on their end. It's comfortable and has good talk time too.But I have problems where it drops connection all the time while in standby. It also frequently will pick up a call, but have no sound. the phone has no sound either. So I have to disconnect the thing and call the person back without the headset. This can be a major pain.The other problem I have is that the conversation is very half duplex. I can talk, or listen. But due to the lag from the headset and the cellphone combined, there's lots of stepping on other people's words back and forth. I think this is due to the noise cancel feature.I would used this headset all the time if not for those problems. As it is, I only use it when wire and hands free is priority. Disappointing."
3,Not what I expected,"This unit looks like the picture....but it difficult to place on the ear. The reversible feature is nice....you can switch from either ear relatively easily, but the tiny black on/off switch is really a pain! You have to hold it down for a few seconds, let go, then hold it down again.The cheaper Motorola original bluetooth is much easier to use."
2,Did not work well with my Samsung phone,"Although a nice looking unit, I had many problems with it functioning with my Samsung phone. Problems with the voice dial feature as well as connecting with the phone just drove me crazy. So much so that I actually tore the unit in half (not recommended). Perhaps the unit was not designed to work with the phone I had, I'm not sure. Any bluetooth headset should work with a bluetooth phone but I'm learning that is not the case.Plantronics is a good brand and I don't mean to knock them but I wasn't satisfied with this product."
3,Great sound--poor on/off button,"This headset sounds great, fits well, and has great volume--but it does not work with Cisco IP Communicator (VoIP), and the on/off button is extremely difficult to use, especially if you're in the car. If you have big fingers, forget it."
4,It works!,"This unit works! I had 2 Motorola bluetooth headsets and I was about to give up on bluetooth headses altogether. This one sounds good in the car for both the listener to whom I am talking to and for myself. In fact it actually sounds better than pressing the phone up to my ear. It can be loud as well which is good and bad. The good is when you have a lot of background noise, this thing can be heard. The bad, is it can be really loud!It is a little difficult to use, but once it is on it is very comfortable. However you have to take it on and off to use the ridiculously small on/off button. Not good for anyone with large hands. The battery could last a little longer too.In summary I have tried other headsets besides the Motorola ones and this one sounds the best. Especially in a car where it makes the most difference since my car has a manual transmission. I also use it in the office with my computer. It works. That is all I care about at this point."
4,Light and Loud,I can wear this all day. Crystal clear sound and higher volume when compared to my Jabra. People on the other end of the call have no trouble hearing me. LED that indicates power on is a bit on the bright side and was a distraction at first. My only complaint is that the phone has to be on the same side of my body as the headset for a consistant connection.
1,Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. After several weeks of use, the bluetooth product stopped working completely. It was fully charged, but wouldn't turn on and work. I finally had to buy a new bluetooth(jawbone). Additionally the tiny little power button was awkward and in a bad position on the product, not convenient for turning on. I did a lot of research and this product was supposedly one of the best. I am VERY disappointed!"
2,Mouth piece came off after 6 months normal use,"The mouth piece cover came off after 6 months of normal use. It seems like some poor quality adhensive has been used to attach the mouth piece cover to the main body. See the custom pics I have uploaded on what happened to my device. Audio quality suffers badly without the mouth piece cover. I can tape the cover to the main body, but since it is under warranty, I will try to send it back. The device still works other wise. I will update with the outcome of trying to send this back to the reseller.6 months is too short a life-span for a blue tooth device. 2 stars."
3,"Solid bluetooth, a little large","What I like.The sound quality is great. The mic does not pick up much background noise. Compared to other bluetooth headsets, this headset will let you room 20-30 feet before starting to break up.What could be improved.This headset is large and the way my ears are shaped causes the mic to rub against my face / stuble. Unfortunately there is not an adjustment to adjust the mic. There are 2 earpiece options, one for outside of your ear, the other for inside your ear. The inside the ear piece works well but gets uncomfortable after wearing for a long while. The outside the ear piece just causes the mic to stick against my face worse.Overall impression.Find this headset in a retail store and try it on before you buy. However, this is a good headset; better than my Jabra and much better than my Motorola."
5,Great!,Works much better than others that I have tried. I am a woman and it is not too big on my ear and I have a smaller face. Very light weight and easy to use. Good purchase!
1,"Sorry, not what I expected",The ear piece and loop are very large and cumbersome and difficult to adjust for both ears.Seemed ok at first but kept losing my bluetooth connection this Treo and finally crapped out completely.Will return and try again.
4,Much better than Motorola HS850,"This is only my 2nd headset, and I much prefer it to the Motorola HS850. It stays in your ear and has plenty of volume to overcome road noise in a car. However, when my headset is on for extended periods, it sometimes experiences problems (will answer calls but not transfer them to the earpiece). Turning headset off then on again fixes this problem. Battery life and charge time seems excellent, but I don't have much to compare it to. For those wanting to use it with your office phone also, the Plantronics bluetooth office phone adapter is EXPENSIVE ($200+ in Office Depot)."
2,Wishful thinking,"I was really hoping that this headset would work with my LG VX8300. I was told that once I upgrade my software on my phone, it would work. Well, it doesn't. The static continues to come through. The phone loses the signal on this headset constantly. And if someone tries to call in...forget it! 4 out of 5 times, the phone won't pair correctly to answer a call. A shame really.On a good note, it pairs easily. It charges extremely quickly and feels comfortable on the ear. I'll probably have to sell mine off. No point trying to kick a dead horse."
4,Good Sound Quality,This is my second bluetooth headset. The first one was stylish but had terrible sound quality. This one is much better. The reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it doesn't have noise canceling technology so I still can't make calls with the sunroof open.
1,I don't like it.,I don't like this product because I have to turn it on and off with my phone by going through several screens. It is just too much work. I regret paying that much for it. The cheaper Plantronics one that I lost was much better. I could turn it on and off at the headset. Maybe I just can't figure out how to do that with this one?
2,not worth it,"I bought this based on the review of sound quality and unless you really like people asking ""what did you say"" over and over again i wouldnt buy this one, i have to be in a totaly quiet environment to use it and i still get complaints"
5,A riot!,All of us at one time or another would love to revisit the innocence of our childhood. This book allows you to do just that. It's a funny and well-written story from a great storyteller.
5,The ONLY Cookbook...,I own two copies- one on the shelf- and the other for the kitchen with most of the pages stuck together (worn from use!). The copy on the shelf is for emergencies when I can't read words from food marks on the used and abused book. I have grand dinner parties with courses and always send my guests home full thanks to this book.
2,Disappointing compared to others in this series,"The buildup was decent but the ending was so abrupt as to leave the reader wondering if Mr. Dietz was suddenly so tired of writing that he wanted to end the story immediately and in any slapdash manner possible. His other novels in the Sam McCade series were better but not as gripping as ""Galactic Bounty"" (aka ""War World). Pity."
5,Essential for serious students of environmental engineering.,Mr. Pankratz's book has become an important component of my reference library. It is easy to use and extremely helpful.
1,Poorly constructed,Ukrainian Phrasebook by Lonely Planet is poorly constructed. Pages folded and glued together or not cut properly.First 8 pages are not usable.Lonely Planet Ukrainian Phrasebook [Paperback]Marco Kandybko (Author)
3,Phrasebook for Ukrain,"Very good size for carrying around. Pretty thorough and includes everything from politics, environment, dining out, dealing with police, taxis/buses, entertainment, etc. I would like to see better indications of how to pronounce their language. It does breakdown their words to give some indication of how to pronounce, however, no indication for example if a vowel is long or short or if ch is hard or soft. Their language is pretty difficult and every thing that would help would be appreciated."
5,This is truly a great phrasebook,"Not many people expect travelers to speak Ukrainian, but if you would, they will treat you very nicely.It helped my friends a lot."
1,Not a great movie!,"I'm a HUGE Rick Springfield fan, but even given that, I can not recommend this movie. It's pretty amateur-ish. It's also poorly acted & just not good. I've actually already donated it to Goodwill!"
1,I'm returning this item!!!,"Please don't waste your time or money with this book... I breezed through this book in no time at all, as it was printed in the hugest font possible and was a measly 150 pages or so. It left so many holes in Mr. Ma's life, and I barely learned anything about him. This book really did NOT do him justice, and I don't understand why there hasn't been a better biography of him published.There were also no photos/pictures in the biography, and the cover had a hideous drawing of Mr. Ma that was the complete opposite representation of his loveliness.So save your money, because after I read this biography I was tempted to just write one myself on Mr. Ma. Seriously!!!!"
5,Very Helpfull Book,This book was well written and very easy to read. A must have for everyone raising chickens.
4,Hallelujah.,"I love my chickens and am thankful to be able to learn with ease how to better care for them, especially in times when I must act fast to keep them healthy. There is detailed info on parasite/bug/disease control that comes in handy when I see odd behaviors in my chickens, as well as details on housing care to give them an environment that encourages health. Thanks, Gail."
3,Time is running out!,"I love that the series FINALLY made it to DVD, but I'm really disappointed in the packaging. I know that there are special features out there that could have been included on the DVDs. I've seen some of them. Why was no commentary added while the creator is still alive to do it? The Waltons fan base is still huge. They'd pay extra for quality."
3,Waltons - season 2,DVDs are great but packaging ios poorly devised. DVDs are stacked on top of one another and difficult to access. Leads to scratching and permanent damage.
5,Motion Detector Garage Door Button,Easy install and mount. This is a good way to light the garage with your hands full and need the light turned on. Taking out the trash is a snap now.
2,disappointingly limited by format,"Numbers 3 and 4 of this series were updates of specific topics, much like the ""current veterinary therapy"" series. This, like Editions 1 and 2, attempts to cover all of zoo medicine in one volume. As this is a rapidly expanding body of knowledge, it is no longer really possible to fit into a single volume. There are very brief overviews of each species without enough depth present- this is not due to the authors, but the format. Especially disappointing is the apparent limitation on the number of references for each section. Providing references on where to look for further information would have made this book much more useful. Hopefully future editions will either show a return to the topic oriented format of 3 and 4, be a multi-volume set containing enough information to be useful, or at least contain sufficient references to be useful as a good bibliography."
3,"Not a bad reference book, but there are better","When my first piggie came to live with me I got one book, Peter Gurney's. However soon after I really wanted to learn as much as I could, so I bought many others, this was one. It is ok, it has really good basic information, but it is not complete. You should really look into other books as well, like The Proper Care of Guinea Pigs, by Peter Gurney.Hope that this helps."
5,"Fun, practical and highly educational","You learn a lot from this book. It has both fun pictures, toy/game oppurtunites and a food guide, etc. A really fun, cool, interesting book! A must-have for raising a healthy guinea pig!!!"
5,Excellent reading for children under seven. Cute fish.,"The book is approriate for ""easy'reading"" level. The story is about a fish that is hungry and finds the most peculiar way to be feed. Children will love the simple and vibrant colors of the picture. My daughter begged me for a copy of her own. This says it all!!"
4,Good coverage of an obscure show,"I actually managed to pick up a copy of this a few years back. I have since picked up the 25th Anniversary Guide that Dawdiziak mentions. The 20th Guide is pretty good, although the coverage of the first two TV movies is a lot more extensive than of the series itself! (This is corrected to some degree in the 25th Guide.) There are a few errors in the cast lists, but generally the book is a good summing up and review of the original '74 series The Night Stalker and the two TV movies that spawned it. The 25th Guide I would give 5 stars for."
1,More a basic dictionary than a guide to style and usage,"I was somewhat surprised that any publisher would consider this text a guide. Basically, it is formatted like a dictionary with various business-related vocabulary listings and their definitions. Usage applies to the spelling and capitalization of the listings. My expectations were that this book was similar to a Chicago Manual of Style within a business writing context that includes recently created words germane to the business world. Unfortunately, it isn't useful in this regard. For example, if you want to find out how to use colloquial business language such as ""leverageable"", you probably won't have much luck with this text as such words appear to be absent....Lastly, the organization leaves something to be desired as the usage topics such as Abbreviations are mixed in with the vocabulary entries, which essentially is the entire book. I really see very little value in acquiring this book..."
4,Good to excellent slow cooker recipes,"I really like this book -- I've recommended it to friends and family. One small caveat: Rodgers assumes you will add or adjust seasonings to taste. If you want it all spelled out for you then you might not want this book. I made the port glazed carrots recently and decided that the seasonings were just a little bland for my tastes and added some ground ginger. Having said all of that, nearly every recipe I have made from this book has been good to excellent. His Potatoes Euphoria is a keeper for sure.As to the ongoing controversy in these amazon[.com] reviews over time versus flavor, I personally like to see the beef or chicken browned first. It adds to both the flavor and appearance and it really doesn't take that long. If you want to throw everything in a crock pot and hope for the best, then buy an older book with can of creamed whatever soup in every recipe instead of this book."
2,"Not exactly a ""one-pot stop.""","Don't expect to combine recipe ingredients in the slow cooker and walk away. More ""pre-cooking"" is involved, most often browning beef, but in some cases dirtying numerous other pots as well. For the most part, the end results are pleasant, but often not worth the extra effort (and, in some cases, it seems as though utilizing non-slow-cooking methods would work just as well, if not better.)"
4,Red Circle has this toy mislabeled! Its really the encore!!!,RED CIRCLE IS ACTUALLY SELLING THE ENCORE VERSION! THIS IS A MISLABELED PRODUCT!!!Bleach: Series 1 Action Figure Ichigo Kurosaki
2,Culturelle was not Effective for Me,"I started taking this product because a Target pharmacist recommended it. It didn't help me at all. Shortly afterward, a G.I. diagnosed my problem as having an overgrowth of bad bacteria in my small intestine because of a round of antibiotics. Culturelle may be adequate for mild digestive problems, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything more serious.As an aside, my G.I. suggested Align. This worked well, but after 2-3 weeks, I became extremely gassy and constipated. I have experimented with a two week on, two week off schedule, and I am eating probiotic yogurt. However, I am still not satisfied. After some research, I have decided to try Flora-Q2. There were many comments online from people who had very good results with it."
2,Not worth the money I paid,"These did absolutely nothing for me. I even doubled the dose to see if that would help, still no results. This could just be me personally that they don't work for, but I've had better results with probiotic pearls and think I will go back to those."
1,Not shipped with a cold pack,"This is the first time I have ordered this product and was surprised when I read the label which states, ""Culturelle must not exceed 75 degrees fahrenheit."" It was not shipped with a cold pack, so who knows how hot this product got in transit. So I am returning it and buying it from a local brick-and-mortar store instead. You can read the product storage how-to here at the Culturelle website: [...]"
2,Didnt make me feel well.,"In general I dont do well with medications, but this one made me feel light headed/dizzy/out of it... and gave me headaches. I tried it for 4 days and just gave up :("
5,Beautiful,"Love this movie! Although sometimes romance takes a detour, this is a beautiful love story and a very enjoyable movie."
4,Terrific observations on 'missing men',"I really liked this book. My girlfriends and I often think of the days when men still hated going to church but at least they went out of obligation!I planned on writing a longer review but I'm still steamed from my last review! (SIDENOTE: Men with teenage daughters that are dressing too sexy, see my review of ""Sexy Girls- How Hot Is Too Hot?"" You'll see what I mean.)Anyways, loads of good stuff in Mr. Murrow's book. I would have given it five stars but it read fairly stiff for my tastes. But if the content connects with the men that need to hear it, I'd amend my rating.Bravo for tackling such a tough topic in the feminized church!"
4,Great read for church leaders,A very thoughtful and thought-provoking book about how churches have pretty much ignored the spiritual needs of men for the last 50 years.
4,Pastor,"I would recommend to any church that is interested in reaching the unchurched to purchase and examine the information that David has presented. I found it to be very informative.When I purchased the book, I wanted to know the ""why"" and I wanted some insight on how to correct the ""why."" I found both and hopefully they will help us in creating an environment appealing to men!"
2,Pot calling the kettle black,"The author has done a fairly good job of noticing certain trends. However, his attempts at solutions were as shallow as the systems already in place that has led to these problems in the first place. He does not go to Scripture for the answers, but rather focuses on ""felt needs""."
3,Insight into men,"The author really knows a man's nature. it describes why men are leaving our contemporary churches. I have seen evidence of this as I have had several men state that they don't go to church because they don't want to lose their ""manhood"". I would not recommend this book for those who are not doctrinally sound or well read in the Bible, as he goes farther than I believe is Bibilically supportable in some of his efforts. But a book worth reading none the less as he points out with lazer precision the problem confronting today's church."
1,A teenager's review,"I just finished watching Safety In Numbers and I was MAJORLY disapointed. First thing me and my sister noticed was the camera angles were bad. I'm not just being nit-picky, the camera angles were at times quite literally sickening. Second, the characters weren't that well built up. They were introduced without really introducing them. For example, one of the girls was introduced and I only learned her name by watching the special features. Lastly of all, the ending. If you've seen the movie then that's a nuf said moment, but for those of you that haven't I'll go into detail. A tree stump could write a better ending and I honestly believe that. On the plus side, it had lots of offensive language which we found EXTREMELY amusing. I think that prolly makes me a inmature person but whatever. Don't watch this movie cause it isn't worth it."
1,NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!,"I have been using this product for over a year now and it was the best laxative on the market. The bottle I just received is half the size of the bottles I usually buy even though the pill count is the same. Everything on the packaging is exactly the same as the old product. With all my previous orders I never needed more than two pills in a day, I am now up to 6 pills (at one time)on this batch and did not had a bowel movement. This formula is definitely not the same as the old product but it is not stated on the label. Don't waste your money on this now useless product. You might get lucky and find the older bottles at your local vitamin shop like I did, But if you're a regular user of this product it's time to start looking somewhere else."
4,not roots but some killer covers,"If your looking for roots reggae you won't find it here, but what you will find is great vocals over more dancehall pop rhymes. Some really great covers such as Bob Marley's Simmer Down Guava Jelly or Bob Dylan's I Shall Be Release and of course Lean On Me which has a great rhyme. Love the songs Mad Mad World Victory Is Near and God Bless The Children (not a Billie Holiday cover). This album is worth having but if your looks for roots check out her Black Woman or Only A Woman albums"
4,Quick response,"When I got this item, I got the wrong one. So I sent an email to the company and they sent me an email saying that was a mistake from the manufacture and they are going to send the right item. Also, they told me that I can keep the wrong item which was a desk with a chair to paint. When I finally get the right item one of its legs was broken, so I sent another email to the company and they replied me immediately that they are going to send the replacement and also I can keep the broken one.I was amazing with the quick response of this company and the good customer service they provide. I definitely will buy with them again."
4,BLACK MAGIC DELIVERS SHOCKS AND SHIVERS,"I was shocked and delighted at this incredibly entertaining and bizarre spectacle that goes way over the top but in some weird way also seems restrained.I'm not into blood and gore or the recent glut of Cinema de Sadism, but this retro classic does not flinch from the story it's telling.Not for all tastes. Actually, on second thought, it's probably not for most tastes.The print looked better than I expected and I liked the rather tight editing that keeps the story moving."
1,Bad electrical connection,"While the mirror bolts on just fine and the weather seal seems to be tight, I returned this mirror because the electrical plug was wrong. It needed to be a male end to connect to the female plug in the door panel, but was female just like the connector in the door. I could have tried to splice on the male connector from the old mirror, but chose to simply get a manual mirror instead (which had its own problems - see other review). According to various checks I did at the website, this was the correct model for my 2004 Camry. Physically it looked correct, but the electrical issue was not worth the trouble. I was concerned that if I spliced on the old connector and there continued to be problems, the motor/gears would prevent manual adjustments of the mirror. And once I had cut the wires I would not be able to return the mirror. That's why I went with a manual mirror in the end."
5,live from golgotha-Gore Vidal,"the golden age,so lets say same as last review-cant type arthritis,like amazon and all books i have bought,a lot!SICK PF PREVIEWS"
3,Velvet Bag,"The description that it is a ""velvet"" bag is false, it is more like velveteen. It is still a nice bag, but it shouldn't be stated that it was velvet. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Arniflora Gel,This is a great product and works better than most allopathic medicines for arthritis pain. It's a natural homeopathic herbal with absolutely no side effects. I recommend it highly. I'm happy I can get it from Amazon.
2,"I have Planters, Morton Neuroma's and Neuropathy, and spurs. Did nothing for me. I still like my ice water bottlles.",Putting Ice Water bottles at the end of my feet when I am in bed is way better than what this did for me. I guess it works from others that have swelling in the knees or different pain than I have.
5,Dirt Poor and great,By far the best cd of the year. Ashanti get off of their jocks you aint nothing compared to Nappy. The best group to hit the airwaves since Outkast.
3,Pretty tight Debut!!!,"Nappy Roots album reminds me of Goodie Mob when they first came out, Str8 country game spit without worrying about what people think. Once you get past how many heavy hitters they sound like (Ex. Scarface, Andre 3000) you'll have a solid album. The producation puts you in a barn with them, while their lyrics guide you threw that ""Kentucky Mud"". So if you like that South sound you will like this cause if it is one thing, it is country and tight!! Peace!!!!"
5,Very great CD,"There aren't many CDs out there where I listen to all the songs and really enjoy them all, but Watermelon, Chicken & Gritz is! This is a must buy for all fans of rap. Buying it for the song Awnaw is enough, but after listening to the rest of it, you will really appreciate having this CD in your collection."
4,...mo fun than a barrel of mud yall...,"...yall dont know nothin bout the country...hip-hop done found its saving grace down in the south!!! it's funny now tho, but when i was coming up erbody here claimed to be from someplace else (we was california, chicago, new york and nem...never from here)...and if you called somebody 'country', then you was libel to get your teeth rattled!!! fareal...anyway...the nappy roots...they from here and parts near here and they proud of it!!! they done did good with this thang here too, especially the first half of the disc...they done up and got beside themselves!!!they coulda left a track or two off for my own likin, but overall this is a good national debut (if you get a chance to come across a bootleg copy of they earlier stuff, get it!!!)...if you like groups like field mob, youngbloodz, old-old outkast, playa fly, goodie mo B and the such, then yall aint gonna have no problem with this either!!!...be good now and show these boys some love..."
1,God is bigger than James White and Harold Camping-,"What are you afraid of Mr. White? If you do not like the teachings of Mr. Camping, then just do not listen! The gospel of according to God's Word from the Bible and it's entirety will be preached and those whom God has planned to save, will be saved because ""faith comes from hearing and hearing by the word of God""(Romans 10:17) No one can come to the Father except through Christ."
4,A sound work on a forgotten war,"Along with the Malayan Emergency, the Philippine war is the most often cited successful counter insurgencies. Again like the Malayan Emergency there is little written on this war and even less that can be called sound scholarly work. Dr. Linn is the exception and has written a detailed, well documented and easily accessible book.Dr. Linn breaks down all the major players on both sides of this conflict and traces them through the war. He breaks down the strategies and tactics that all the different factions. He also shows his research skills by showing what the tactics the U.S. Army actually employed and that there has been an over inflation of atrocities that were committed.This is good book for someone interested in the war, and it is an excellent resource for the student doing research. Either way the book is a must have for one's own personnel library."
4,Philippine War 1899-1902,"A well balanced study in an oft missrepresented war showing both sides of the war. Note: The Philippines are who they are today as a direct positive result of this war. This book has many modern applications in what it will take to win an insurgent war today. You often feel like you are reading today's news complete with an opponent who seeks to effect an American election by American military casualties. We didn't fall for it in 1900. This book takes you by island by island, challenges, defeats and victorys. A positive read. Informative. It is not a page turner which is why only four stars. But if you have a space on your shelf for this time in American military history about a successful strategy, this is your book. God Bless America and God Bless you."
3,Beautiful images of Venice,"A marvellously eying little book, with stunning black and white pictures by Giuseppe Bruno, a renowned Italian photographer. The book consists of a compilation of frgaments from Harold Brodkey's books and essays, all dealing with Venice, soem of which seem to capture the Venetian atmosphere very well, in a beautiful, lyrical language. Some, however, are almost too lyrical and dense. Others remain too muc a fragment, rather than serving as stand-alone texts. In all, however, this is a beautiful tribute to Venice."
4,First book of rome!,Excellent book detailing the rise of Marius and Sulla in the lead up to the birth of Julius Caesar and the fall of the Republic. Terrific character depth brings ancient Rome to life. Sets the scene for the remainder of a mostly well written series on Rome.
1,Avoid this book unless you absolutely worship McCollough,"There have been some Colleen McCollouch books I liked, but I thought this one was pretty bad. It was over long, and while fairly well researched contained some inaccuracies-- also, the writing was pretty bad, a suprise for me since I have always thought McCollough was a pretty good writer. She uses a few too many hackneyed cliches in this one, though."
1,Boring!,"Am I the only person who didn't like this book? I normally love historical books, but this one was incredibly boring. It was a struggle to get through it. That the author did her research is undeniable. The problem is, she seemed to be more concerned with showing off all her research than with writing an interesting story. In a historical novel, this is inexcusable. It read more like a bad textbook than a novel. She did a good job with The Thorn Birds, but this was terrible."
4,Ancient Rome brought to life,"I picked this book up in a thrift store, never having heard of it. I have a casual interest in ancient Rome and am currently living in Naples, so I thought it would be fun to read. I was astounded by how complete and real Colleen McCullough has made ancient Rome. This book is incredibly well-researched. Every detail adds to the richness of this world. The reader really becomes subsumed into ancient Rome and the characters are exceptionally substantive. The glossary alone is worth reading.The only drawback was the writing was a bit stilted in places, but I would still highly recommend this book. In fact, I have been recommending it to everyone. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series."
5,every one needs cable ties,Thie is a convenient pack of cable ties. I figured every home needs cable ties and this is a perfect assortment of colors and sizes.
4,main focus- chapter seven,"Overall I think Sturken and Cartwright's book Practices of Looking: an Introduction to Visual Culture was the most informative and forward resource avalable to me. The other books and articles I resourced held alot information but where not as indepth or sensitive to the important aspects of postmodernism and the artists, thoerist and movements involved in the late twentieth century. Sturken and Cartwright take their readers through the chapter in a step by step process with an explanation for everything. I found it helpful though to visit the glosary for further explainations if it was needed. It was nice not to have to refer to other texts or sources if I did not understyand something in the core of their book. I did not ever find any of the inforation to be false nor did the authors ever make me feel as if they may not be an authority on the topics at hand. This is a very persuasive book full of important context that I will definetly use for a future resource."
3,"Nice idea, but...","A month ago, my 2 year old grandson opened one of my taps and spilled about 5 gallons of beer on my laundry room floor. That's when I knew something needed to change. I bought 2 of these (one for each tap) and am very happy with one exception. Because you use a key to lock/unlock, it has to stop perpendicular to the floor (or parallel to the tap lock device depending upon how you look at it). One of my taps locks perfectly while the other stops about 5 degrees before being able to remove the key. Backing off the key to be able to remove it causes the tap to be able to be opened to a fast drip. Not acceptable given my environment. So, I'm forced to jam a small piece of cardboard between the plunger and the tap which solves the problem. Not a big deal but these things are not terribly cheap so I expected a bit more flexibility in the closure aspect."
2,So boring,"This was so boring and unrealistic. If I can't get past the fact that Madeleine has been with hundreds of men than I doubt that a man in 1816 could look past it without even a flinch. The hero and heroine were in bed within the first chapter. 4 years later Devlin accidentally stumbled into Miss M and felt it was his duty to rescue her after she had just bit a customer's member. He brings her to his home with her child and maid and cares for and supports them. I don't think so. One chapter later they are naked again. This was truly what I expect from a Harlequin. Boring dialogue, one dimensional villain and characters that I don't really care about. While what I read of this book only deserved 1 star I gave it two stars simply because I couldn't get past page 150. That is the maximum amount of pages that I'm willing to waste on a book that I find excrutiating to read. Who knows it might have drastically improved. I doubt it though."
2,a Harlequin,"The storyline for this regency is a bit different in that she's a prostitute after falling for a man's advances. Her despoiller continues to use her like bait -- luring gentlemen for a night with the mysterious masked Miss M - whom he's trained between beatings.He never lets a man continue to visit 'Miss M"" often enough to threaten his hold over her. Untill he loses badly in a card game to Lord Devlin. Sounds like it'd be good, huh?Devlin truly saves Miss M (Uhh, can we get a name please?). He's a soldier who's believably in love with her. sigh. The gentleman is willing to set mother and child up comfortably, and then never see her again, after the marriage (to someone else) he must make - as he feels responsible for Miss M.Sap. I recommend this book for Harlequin subscribers, but most may prefer a more interesting story (not just storyline). This doesn't have that level of stimulation throughout to be a good romance novel."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"This product does not work, you are better off buying the ""sauna"" shorts or the ""sweat"" suits that boxers wear to work out if you are looking to shed some inches. Total waste of money, plus you go into the gym smelling like a medicine cabinet."
4,Background Info for Web Service Standards,"I am an author of one of the chapters in the book. While working on a number of internet protocols around workflow and BPM, I needed a way to get non-formal helpful descriptions of different standards into practitioners hands. I chose to include the chapter in the workflow handbook because as far as I can tell, it is the only compendium of current BPM and workflow material available. Many of the experts in the field have articles in the book. If you have a basic understanding of business process systems, and you need to dig a little deeper and get up to date on the latest developments, this book is a good way to come up to speed quickly."
5,It Worked Then--It Still Works Now,"I just started working out again after being lazy and sedentary for TOO many years. I was excited to find that you could still purchase the Jane Fonda workout collection. It does the job in a fun and enjoyable manner. Some things never change...and what works to get one in shape hasn't changed that much. Even though the gals' hair and such look a tad bit out of date (haha), the girls still look FANTASTIC!! Excellent price for the collection. MG in Oklahoma"
1,listed as new came used. seal is broken.,I bought this item as a present for someone and when I opened the yellow envelop I noticed the the DVD has been opened and the seal is on top is broke. So now i have to buy a new one to give a new gift ver. a flea market item.
4,From Romance to funk,"Another interesting Cafe compilation, from slow to fast you will still enjoy the choices."
1,THIS IS A CAFE DEL MAR COPY!! DO NOT BUY!,"As a loyal fan of Cafe del Mar in San Anotnio, Ibiza and the downtempo, beach vibe, I felt that I had to write this review to spare some of you from spending your hard earned dollars on this record. The original Cafe del Mar series started with DJ Jose Padilla and continued with new resident DJ, Bruno Leprete, after Jose left. You will notice that neither of these players had ANYTHING to do with this volume 8 release. As part more big record label you know what, two unknown DJs slaped this together, stole the Cafe del Mar name (if you look close enough you will see that it is not the real logo), and took the series to number 8.As a good friend of the folks at Cafe del Mar, I already own the newest, AUTHENTIC, release which is called DREAMS 2 compiled by the Cafe del Mar resident Bruno Leprete. PLEASE look out for this release and save your money to purchase it because it is even better than volume 7 - trust me!!!!!"
2,Gynt at the Gate-5 stars,"Only worth your time for ""Gynt at the Gate"". Extraordinary, spirited piece that I listen to repeatedly(thanks Fiona R!)The rest is either of marginal interest or completely dismissible."
5,Indispensable,"This book is deservedly considered a classic. Though fifteen-plus years old, this advice is based upon Reppert's experience with people, plants and products, and so isn't dependent upon market conditions for its relevance and usefulness. Easy to read, widely applicable."
2,Did not meet my expectations,"Reading previous reviews was a major factor in deciding to buy this book, hoping it explains how to grow herbs and then how to make a good business out of it. Unfortunetaly, I soon found out that the book was not anywhere near the 5 star rating given by others."
5,We're all different,"Easy-to-read book intended for the general reader demonstrating the large amount genetic variation present in the human population. However, the specific migration of early humans throughout the world and the establishment of diverse populations worldwide is not covered in this reference."
3,Good idea that is hard to use.,"I bought the watch because it has an altimiter, but the altimeter is hard to use and I have not taken the time to use the CD that gives instructions."
5,For my grandson,Our grandson loved our copy of Kid Camping so we got him one of his own. The illustrations were great and the information more entertaining than other books on the subject.
2,Inconsistent,"I don't really get all the other glowing reviews. This book is loaded with inconsistencies. While the back story is reasonably good, each story segment is drawn out and drags. There are three instances of characters in the story falling in love for no apparent reason; On one page they first meet and a few pages they are telling each other I Love you/I've been waiting for you my whole life.The proofreading was done very poorly; A character that is named Richards is referred to as Richardson on one page. Although there are references to 9/11 (the tragedy) in one case calling emergency is referred to as 9/11 rather than 911. People are referred to with the wrong names.Skip it. Not worth the read."
2,Predictable story line and POOR writing,"I eagerly awaited my copy of Winter in Kandahar based on the setting of the plot and the wonderful reviews readers left on Amazon. I was disappointed. The setting offered a grand opportunity for an excellent novel but Dr. Wilson was unable to pull much more than a predictable story line with this opportunity. Worse, Dr. Wilson needs to learn sentence combining and to write effective dialogue. Where on earth was his editor? The sentences in this book are choppy and do not flow easily. Often there are too many insignificant details that slow the plot. Potential here? Yes, as long as Dr. Wilson gets some writing instruction."
3,This is more a Drama based book than Thriller/Action,Overall this is a mediocre story that revolves more around the dramas of developing relationships than the secondary thriller/action sub plot. If Tom Clancy is your 'cup of tea' then do not bother - you will only be dissappointed. As to the reviewer that said that this book showcases special forces or the espionage world - he is cracking jokes.The book is extremely slow in places and is hard to get into. For example 50 (approx) pages to develop the relationship between two of the main characters whilst in a prison hospital goes too far. As for those that have described the ending as 'interesting' or a 'total suprise' need to read more. With the amount of medical terminology used it is very evident that this was written by doctor.A generous 3 stars.
3,Hydraulic Closer,Installs easy. Still slams the door shut. Kinda pointless isnt it?Word of advice. be sure that you can use the mount with your setup.
5,Best Legolas!,"Well, I don't know what anyone else thinks about this figure, but i think this Legolas is absolutely awesome! He has the best headsculpt since the Legolas in Rohan armor. He actually looks like Legolas! His detailing is awesome, and his action is way cool! He actually throws the arrows! His arm doesnt have any joint because of the action, but this doesnt take anything away from the overall figure.This Legolas is AWESOME!!"
5,wonderful,I have never felt so secure and covered up while nursing my baby until I bought this nursing cover. I'm covered from the front and back.
3,Good Examples but...,"The book should have been titled ""Advanced Windows API How-To using C++ Builder"" or something else more appropriate. The examples are good but complex. If you're a novice with CPPB this book will be totally useless to you."
2,poor service poor product info,"I received this product but after trying it on my shitzu i could put both of my shitzus in it, they do not give much on product info its not like i can try it on before purchase, so I ordered a med, after reading reviews. well i received not one ""doggie life jacket"" in the box but"" 2"" so i had to send them both back wellllll first i had to go on line and wait for an approval from the company which took 24-36 hrs then print out the return label, heres the best part,, took it to the post office which then cost me $8.80 cents' non refundable last time i will ever order from this company!!!!!THIS COMPANY SUCKS BIG TIME! the least they could do is send a return label, plus i had to pay for the added weight of BOTH jackets which I did not order>>>>"
4,Descent into murderous paranoia,"This was the first of the Boyle/McDonald/Hodge/McGregor filmic collaborations and what a fantastic debut! The story of three flatmates who discover their new flatmate dead and a wad of cash - it's a beguiling premise and one that would certainly give anyone second thoughts. It certainly doesn't spoil the plot to say that they take the cash but there the problems begin.The three leads are uniformly excellent with Ewan McGregor showing the talent that would push him to movie stardom (and I don't mean ""that"" talent, for all you watchers of The Pillow Book and Velvet Goldmine). However it's Kerry Fox who is the most outstanding here and proves what a consistently underrated actress she is. Her character plays a game with both of her male flatmates, trying to make sure she is on the ""winning"" side.There is plenty of evidence here of Danny Boyle's directorial finesse which is why Hollywood have come calling - if only he hadn't answered their call.................."
5,An amazing film!,"I'm surprised this film didn't get more attention. Trainspotting got a lot of press and was good, but this is better. The momentum ranges from fast to slow, but there's so much eye candy, you stay glued to the screen wanting more. The plot twists are equally amazing. I saw this movie with 10 people and no one guessed the ending (at least not all of it)-and the ending was great, which is hard to pull off with a plot this bizarre. In general, I don't like violence, but it's so important to the story that it works well. This is a fascinating but spooky movie! Don't expect to feel reaffirmed that humans are wonderful, but if you like to think and want something different, expect to enjoy this movie entirely and want to see it again and again."
5,"Awsome ""what's going on movie""",This movie was worth ordering. About three room mates living and trusting each other go and find a fourth room mate. He turnes up dead with lots of money. I liked how the rest of the movie show's how true friends can change or not. When theres lot's of money involved. All I have to say this was a great film and I liked the characters...
4,Classic Jane Fonda in easy to use format,The original VHS programs all on one DVD. I am back on the program now. I expect it to work just as well this time as it did when I used it a few years back on VHS.
2,not good as her earlier ones,Her earlier tapes are good and organized. But the DVD lacks the spirit in previous ones and the programs are not well organized.
4,This item doubled in price since Jane Fonda was on Oprah (less than 2 weeks ago!),Why has Amazon more than doubled the price on this item in the last week or two (I can only think it's because demand spiked after Fonda was on Oprah). Boo Amazon! Buy it from collagevideo.com for under $20.
3,too hard to follow for a complete beginner,"I tried to use the low-impact aerobics section and could not follow it. There was no instruction or step-by-step description of the moves. They were too complicated and too fast to learn just by watching. They seem to assume you already know the moves and just need to be told which one is coming next. I used to use Jane's low-impact aerobics tape from 20 years ago, that Jane led herself, and that one was described as it went along and was easy to follow. Not this one.Also the sculpting parts require weights, which it doesn't say on the outside of the DVD, and seems to assume you already own them (or the DVD is supposed to come with them) and doesn't list what all you need.I was disappointed."
4,Great fun & intriguing theme...,"Very amusing whodunnit with many stings in the tail before we reach the riveting conclusion. However, what makes this a far more interesting read is the very provocative ""japanese in America"" corporate backdrop. Clearly, Crichton is using the detective/mystery context to raise all sorts of mischevious questions about Japanese infiltration of U.S. corporate institutions, American xenophobia, and the existence of worlds-within-worlds in today's corporate life. Some of this ""paranoid"" description seems a little dated at this point, in 2002 -- clearly, the mired-in-recession Japanese are less of a threat today than was perceived in the early '90s, when the book was written.Nevertheless, a page-turner in the classic sense, as well as a not-so-subtle social commentary... One of Crichton's better efforts."
4,"Murder, corporate takeovers and kinky sex.",A very intriguing book where a Japanese corporation tries to cover up the murder of a blonde with very odd sexual preferences. Great techno-thriller / mystery. This book will keep you guessing and keep you reading. For once Crichton's characters actually take on some dynamics... some. - J.A.S.
3,"A thrilling, yet dated ride of intrigue","Michael Crichton takes us on an adventure into Japanese-American corporate finance with a little murder twist thrown in. He includes a lot of Japanese ""take-over"" of American business in this tale and how this culture handles murder in the board room. Like other Crichton novels, this book is suspensful, thrilling, and entertaining. Why did I only give it three stars? It's not one of my favorite books by Crichton and the corporate tale is a bit dated and maybe even somewhat jaded. It is a good book though, and I highly recommend it."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Rising Sun was a tough one to get through. It wasn't extremely long, but without having any prior knowledge of Japanese business or customs I found myself boggled by the details. Once finished, I felt it was a satisfying read, but not something I would have an interest in reading again. Rising Sun is a must for the more rabid Michael Crichton fans, but casual readers should pass this one by."
2,A Good Read,"This novel was suspenseful, however, there was a lot of time spent on how the Japanese will destroy the American way of life. This concept is not terrible, except that the writer did not develop this theme deeply enough. Also, at times I felt that the writer rambled.A good read if you're looking for simple entertainment"
3,From the perspective of a fan of Michael Crichton. . .,". . .I can only cautiously endorse this book.The plot is tightly written. The characters are well-developed and believable. The anti-Japanese message is certainly politically incorrect and a bit problematic -- but probably not all that inaccurate. (This element of the novel will no doubt offend many). The violence is graphic -- much more so than the typical Crichton novel. The sex is quite graphic -- FAR more so than anything else I've ever read by Crichton. (This element will also offend many).As I stated, I would give this book an endorsement because it truly is quality research and writing. However, the controversial elements in the book are very real -- and if you're easily offended by such things, give this one a miss."
4,Is Japan really invading us?,"Definitely this book is a page turner, and if it's true that the japanese are buying all the important things of America the government must do something, but I don't believe that in Japan are no poor people, I know that the Japanese get married with their job and company, but it is a very poor country, remember the last earthquake there? they ask for help because they don't have enough money.Another interesting point of Japan is that they have the higher number of suicide between ages 12 to 25 because of the competition at school or work. Japan is not the easiest place to live, but, we have to take care of what they are buying not only in America but in the world, because they don't invent anything, they copy everything, but they copy it well and they make it better than the original.The end of the book is not so good because John Connor who knows the japanese very well assume what happened and why, he doesn't really know why ..."
4,A Note on Censorship,"It's been a while since I read this, but I remember all of the stories being pretty good. I'm only weighing in here to point out that it was Stephen King himself who censored this book. In a speech to a library association, which you can read at , King states that after his book (specifically the story called ""The Rage"") had been mentioned in connection with 2 school shootings, and the FBI requested an interview with King, he called his publisher and asked them to take it out of print. While this is unfortunate censorship that King may have been driven to, he ultimately censored himself."
4,the bachman books,"thank you for the fast service and good condition of the book,i hope to be one of your best customers through out the year, again , thank you. donna"
5,READ THIS COOLECTION,"Stephen King is a master storyteller and it shows here. I found ""Rage"" and ""The Long Walk"" completely enthralling. Though if forced to chose between the two I would have to choose ""The Long Walk."" If you only read one of the four, read this one."
5,"Excellent, what I've come to know & love!","Be it Richard Bachman or Stephen King, the wrinting is always captivating! Love it and will certainly enjoy reading it."
1,Incorrect Info,"This product is neither time released nor standardized as it states in the ad. The bullet point that states ""Each chlorophyll-coated tablet of Nature's Sunshine Time Release Valerian contains 500 mg of the finest valerian root extract, concentrated and standardized to 0. 8 percent valerenic acid"" refers to a product manufactured by Nature's Sunshine. this product is made by Sundown Naturals. This is completely misleading as you are purchasing a non-standardized whole-plant product. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,"Good for some, perhaps, but not for others","I didn't really gain much insight as to the types of activities I was hoping to explore in Mexico (Chiapas). Granted, there is a good deal of info regarding museums and markets in Let's Go, but not very much regarding ecotour and other outdoor pursuits, which don't get much mention at all in this guide. If you're looking for info regarding hotels and cultural attractions, Let's Go may be a good choice. If you're looking for info regarding ecotourism, outdoor activites, and other such things that may be a little off the beaten path, Rough Guide or Lonely Planet is probably the better buy."
4,Excellent,it was an excellent choice. I wanted to buy it because last one I had gotten was 2001. This got new prices but not the newest ones.
4,funny...,"It's not Japanese; it's Korean version of American Pie. Why does the Japanese take credit for everything, tsk tsk tsk"
1,No longer made,"I was interested in this product, but concerned that I couldn't find it on Gateway's web site. I called and asked support and was told it was ""no longer being sold"" on 21-Nov-04."
5,No Question is the bomb!,"This CD is full of great tones and their voices are spectacular. The best songs are ""Lights On, Lights Off"", ""He Say, She Say"", and ""Just Can't Go On"". When I bought the CD I thought it would just be another additive to my collection but now it's my fave!"
2,Another Grateful Dead exploitation album,"Once again, reggae musicians who are not familiar with the Dead are brought together to play their music. Considering their lack of knowledge, they do a so-so job. But the Dead's music was in the soul, man! The people who put this out are just capitalizing on the lingering longing for the Grateful Dead. Avoid this and buy Dick's Picks from the Dead themselves!"
3,Handle,This is a nice pot. I had it for about a week now and I've used it twice. The pot took the seasoning well and has no obvious flaws in casting. The problem is the handle. It is way to flimsy for a cast iron dutch oven of this size.
2,*** Better Live than Studio ! ***,"Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Frank Marino ! I have had the privilege of seeing him live on several occasions and ALWAYS walk away from his performances slack jawed ! He is a PHENOMENAL guitar player , BUT in all honesty his true strengths are in his 'Live' recordings and not studio albums . This album is only interesting to die-hard fans and not casual listeners. It's only saving grace is in fact the nearly 17 minute bonus track that was tacked on for the re-master release , but even that isn't enough to give it the nod of approval . Over all I was very dissapointed as I am with all of his studio releases . If you REALLY want to hear how talented this man is , then skip the studio releases and pick up his LIVE recordings ......There are three official "" Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush "" live albums and ALL of them are OUTSTANDING !!! Hendrix / Trower / Alvin Lee ALL get a run for their money by Frank's live stuff !!!"
3,Good price. Ok mug.,"The mug itself is not bad. But the lid is not tight. Overall its good, since I could not find any other ceramic travel mug for sale on the net."
5,Works!,This product has worked for my pms. It truly has been a life saver. My mood swings were so bad and my marriage was suffering from them. I started using this creme and within a couple of days I noticed a huge difference in myself. I feel so much better!!
1,Allergic reaction,"I am not sure whether or not this products works. After using it for only 3 days, unfortunately I had a terrible itchy rash on the places where I rubbed in the cream (my neck and wrists). Took quite a while for it to resolve. I guess there is something in the cream that I am allergic to. I have used Dong Quai in the past, which I have had great results with controlling hot flashes. Just wanted to try this cream instead of taking pills."
2,LOOOOWWWW dosage,"I thought this could help me out but it doesn't work for me. I'd have to use the entire contents of the container to equal even 1/2 of the daily amount prescribed by my obgyn. Shame too, because I hate the crap thats in the unnatural version. I would have appreciated a clearer description of the dosage amounts on the purchase page. Also the product is really greasy and comes off in dirty clumps."
2,Perfumed product,"Sometimes I regret ordering via mail and this is one of those times. After carefully reviewing this product I thought I would try it as it was so much less costly than the Natural Woman progesterone cream I have happily used for years. I can see nowhere on this container that says it has fragrance, but it certainly does. I am extremely sensitive to fragrances, allergic to many. So this product will NOT be used by me. The odor was overwhelming to me (probably would not overwhelm most people but it is quite fragrant). I hope I can return it."
2,A little concerned...,"Creamy, lightly scented, blends in well.I stopped using this cream when I read the fine print and saw in bold writing ""this product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer."""
1,Source natural progesterone cream,It Doesn't work is like a cream with smell. The smell is not great. Waste of money. I didn't like it.
4,Great novel with some weaknesses.,Again great writing with too many side issues and a weak main character who makes too many mistakes for someone who's supposed to be a professional.
3,Something Missing,"This is a South Chicago story and probably has more impact if you've lived there. Her business as a private eye helped V. I. Warshawski to escape from the `hood, but she feels ensnared again when a childhood friend's appeal for help draws her obsessively back to investigate her friend's unknown paternity. The quest for the friend's father, the murder of a high school friend, and other threads put her on the trail of powerful and ruthless men, who make her their next target. This story borders on being very good. The detective work and suspense are good but not particularly memorable. I have the feeling that V. I. is intended to be a character of some depth, but something was missing in the recorded book version, read by Donada Peters. V. I. seemed reckless, rather than tough. Maybe I expected Kathleen Turner."
1,Worst I've ever seen,"Do not be deceived by the editorial review of this film. This movie was the worst example of an instructional video I've ever seen. The two main characters were obviously straight porno ""actresses"" and not into each other at all. The entire video was dubbed over with annoying music, I'm sure, to mask out the direction by the male writer/producer/director. This movie is nothing more than a male FANTASY of what two women would do together. It is not even close to a true representation of one woman pleasuring another. It rates lower than a ""B"" movie - I'd rate it an ""F"". I gave it a one star because the system wouldn't let me give it zero stars (or negative 5)."
1,"Magdalene, It's never too late to begin a new life",MagdaleneVery disappointing. The author failed to stay true to the scripture relating to Mary Magdalene. She went overboard with her imagination and the plot was sorely lacking.
5,Should have been my first choice,I bought this knife as a replacement to my Kershaw because I lost it (probably because it was too small) and I was amazed at the solid construction and feel of the knife. The knife has great balance and is suprisingly light for the size of the blade. I don't want anyone to think this makes the knife any weaker because I have already put it to the test and it stood up to everything. It is my new EDC and I will try to abuse it but I see it taking anything I throw at it.
5,Excellent High Quality Knife for the Price,This knife screams high-end and actually is. Higher quality AUS8 steel to last and super sharp !!!The easy open power assist works perfectly and amazingly.Overall this is the perfect size to pocket carry and the clip is also high quality and strong.I like this knife very much and the price was too freakin nice.
5,Totally satisfied,"This knife rocks! It is solid easy to open and extremely sharp. The safety lock is a plus to prevent an accidental opening in a pocket...that might be dangerous. I looked a lot of knives and the one thing I liked about this over others is how easily concealable the knife is. Many knives have a clip that makes the knife protrude out of the pocket. This knife keeps the profile of the knife well below the pocket line and the weight of the knife in your pocket. The knife is not too big and not too small. It is big enough to do the job, but small enough not to feel like you're carrying a machete it in your pocket."
4,"Very sharp, a little light","Love this knife, unbelievably sharp out of the box. Handle feels a bit too plastic to get 5 stars."
5,Great Knife,"I purchased one of these knives last spring for myself. I carry it everyday and it's great! The locking mechanism works great as other reviewers have indicated and it is easy to open with one hand. I liked it so well, I bought one for each of my two sons for Christmas. The quality of the materials is good and the blade was very sharp out of the box. I got them quickly from amazon as usual and would recommend to friends."
4,Great knive for carrying!,"I received the TFSA-98 Flash II and couldn't get over how light weight the knife is. It is perfect for carrying, and never leave home without it. Quality craftsmanship makes this knife a great purchase. I am very pleased with this purchase."
3,Good knife except..,"This knife would be good except for its major flaw, the belt clip. The belt clip on this knife can take no pulling force away from the knife itself. Putting lateral pressure causes the plastic where the clip is mounting to fracture ruining the not only the belt clip but also the knife. After minimal use my knifes belt clip was sticking out at a 45 degree angle and platic at the clip mounting was split. Over time the whole plastic sheath split down the center."
4,It opens super fast.,"It opens like a switch blade. It is really really fast. It opens by itself once you start pushing the blade out of the handle. However, the blade feels a little on the cheap side and the shape of the blade could have been better as well. Overall, it is a super blade."
2,Re: could have been better,"This book is full of many statements concerning acts of the law. If one wishes to read about such things, this is the book for you. If you are not interested in things such as courts, judges and gavels I suggest that you buy another book, not this one.The author uses too many complex words and ends up losing the reader in a sea of nonsense arguements. In the future, I suggest the author include more short stories and funny ""law"" anecdotes in order to make the book a bit more fun to read."
5,Happy.,"Bought it your my younger brother. Hes loves the goonies, and i have no complants. recived it in great condition. thanks"
4,An exciting WWII spy novel,"This was a very exciting novel of wartime suspense. Rosie, a fluent French speaking young widow, is dropped off in Nazi occupied France in order to help the Resistance and to determine the Nazis' V-2 rocket plans. Her discovery, capture and subsequent escape are vividly described. This is an exciting yet literate, professionally written thriller that you will find hard to put down. The characters are very real, flesh and blood instead of the usual cardboard cutouts. For those of us who want an exciting story written well, this novel certainly qualifies. It is far above many of it's competitors.Why do the Brits seem to write these so much better than others?"
2,"Less pop, more power","If John Wetton is going to write a good pop song, it is going to be an accident. His best work comes when he is at his most inventive. For some reason he continues to suppress his progressive sensibilities, and most of this album suffers for it. Wetton's voice soars on songs like ""Starless"", ""Thirty Years"" and others where the structure is not so formulaeic. His voice rings flat on pop songs which weren't written to contain it. The exceptions are the two instrumentals (which should not stand out on an album showcasing the vocal talents of Wetton, ""Arkangel"", ""Magazines"", and a beautiful reworking of ""Woman"". If he needs to do pop songs, he should probably do what his other art-rock comrades do, and pick a bunch to covers that can stretch his talents, rather than try to write ""cute"" phrasings, and catchy choruses."
5,Inspiring,This book is both fascinating and inspirational. Fogelman shares the stories of a number of rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust. She also offers her insight regarding the psychological effects of risking ones life for others and why the individuals (and sometimes groups) chose to do good. This novel offers a little known aspect of the Holocaust and presents a shining light from an era of darkness.- College Student
3,Do similar curves establish causality?,"I'm suspicious of this experimental method. If I found two curves (Hary Dent's) with a weak resemblance, and I tweaked the derivation of one curve (with some rationalization that people have kids later nowadays) thus achieving a remarkable resemblance to the other, would I have established causality, or would I merely have established that I'm good at selecting data to make two curves match? (I mean that to be an open question.) There is still a leap of faith at the bottom of this book.I'm also suspicious of large groupings of people, aggregates of spending, and indexes whose constituents change from time to time. What if today's power-spenders haven't saved a penny and decide they have to start? What if their spending has to go to energy while the Dow no longer features energy stocks? What if the money now goes to China -- doesn't the globalization squeeze have any impact on this? What did he assume for inflation after 2002? etc."
5,Time is short,"Reasonable theory with his demographic studies. Takes one hour to read and can be very helpful to your financial planning, if in fact the baby boomers can affect the economy like he says."
5,Penguins are a plus!,"This book rocks. Simple, funny, ...actually hilarious, inspiring, thought provoking,...it is a gift to be able to communicate thoughts through such an amazingly creative means, John Shore has that gift. It is a book that I love to revisit again and again, and would most highly recommend to anyone looking for a fresh, insightful, highly understanding, and true perspective on life, God,...and well...the whole shebang."
5,This is a book for real people in need of an encounter with a real God.,"I think I have been looking for a book like this since before I was ordained, but sometime after I was confirmed, maybe while I was in college, but definitely when I was in seminary.Shore has managed to articulate a healthy systematic theology without droning on like an academic pompous pious poopyhead.This book will separate the sheep from the goats. If they can get beyond the concept of God saying ""pissed off"" and ""cheeky monkey,"" they might just realize that Christianity is not a dried-up lacey doily sentimental thing in an old biddy's dusty armoire, but a living dynamic force at work in the world.So, John Shore, enough of my pontificating-- this is my way of saying thanks-- you just made my job as a pastor more inspiring and a lot easier. I look forward to gifting your book to my happy Lutherans, and inflicting it upon the holier-than-thou ones."
3,I wanted to like this more,"I like a good invasion story, and when I read the review on the book (I realize its marketing, but I fell for it) hailing it as an invasion book on par with Niven's Footfall, I was really excited. As I slogged through the book, my excitement waned.Understand going in that this is a character-driven story. Nothing wrong with that, and for what it tries to achieve, it does a good job. What it is not, however, is exciting.Oh, it starts strong, with mysteries and an apocolyptic warning. But what we never do is encounter the enemy, let alone begin to understand it. When salvation is offered to some, the reasoning behind it is also unexplained.If the author tried to make the reader feel like he was trapped between two forces beyond his comprehension, only able to descirbe the symptoms without ever knowing the cause, well then mission accomplished.For a reader who wants to understand WHY, this book will disappoint."
4,"Very Good, but very Depressing also","I have to say I really liked Forge of God. It was really well written, and I thought the concept was brilliant. I think that it showed the truth that if there is an alien race out there that is advanced enough to reach us there wouldn't be much we could do to stop them from doing whatever they wanted to us.The book does get very depressing as it goes on. You realize that the Earths fate has been sealed and there is nothing we can do to stop it.I thought the book had a few slow parts and, the ending was bleak but, there is sequel out there so I hope we get our revenge. I will be reading it and hoping.I recommend Forge of God to any sci-fi junkies out there."
5,Excellent and disturbing. Have read it again and again.,"One of my favorite books. Aliens stop by to visit, and we don't know why until it is WAAAY too late. Elements of horror a la ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" mixed with an interesting plot make this a great read.This is a book for readers who like the plot to jump in, grab them, and not let them go until the last page slaps 'em in the face"
4,"Good hard SF, fast-paced and intelligent","An enjoyable read, hard to put down. Not quite one of his best, but if you like Bear, well worth it..."
4,A Classic!,"The Forge of God isn't necessarily the type of story most Greg Bear readers cut their teeth on, but it is a classic SF story. I liked this one a lot and it is one of the few books I've reread. Despite what some other reviewers say, the reader is definitely rewarded in the end with this one. The ending is spectacular."
2,Mount Doom Frodo,"It took few days of display to better appreciate this toy. The likeness is of an exhausted, emaciated Elijah Wood. At first glance, he looks rather odd because his neck is a little longer than it should be, but then that's because the head is hinged so that his chin can almost rest on his chest; nice touch for posing him in Sam's arms. He comes with a sound base that resembles a small island in the lava flow from Mount Doom. There are pegs which fit the holes in his feet and he stands very well. But I was disappointed that he only has one quote, albeit a good one - 'I'm glad that you're with me, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things' - and he's still wearing the one Ring around his neck. Still, I purchased both of the M.D. hobbits and as they do look just terrific together, I'm happy."
4,One of his best.,"Kent continues to produce great adventure, history, and unforgettable characters in this 14th installment of the Bolitho series. Highly recommended."
2,Allies and Adversaries,"I found this book too political and not enough about the joint chiefs of staff, no pictures and wasn't what I expected."
3,"Good for beginners, not those serious about private equity","This book is good for beginners who want to know more about the VC process, but it needs to be updated for modern practices. It also needs to be edited for gramatical errors, which I found unacceptable given the price of the book.If you are truly interested in private equity either as a student, angle investor, or professional, then I recommend a book by Josh Lerner: ""Venture Capital & Private Equity - a Casebook"". It is very thorough and modern."
5,Tremendous Book,"This book is the best I have found on analyzing companies for private investment. David Gladstone provides step-by-step instructions on how to analyze a company for private investment purposes. I highly reccommend it for venture capitalists, private investors, and angels"
4,Nice clock,"We have had this clock for about a month now, so far it has worked perfectly. It looks great in our kitchen, no complaints."
1,"typically a broken clock is right twice a day, this one is not right even once!","Typically, a broken clock is right twice a day, this one is not right even once! I thought it was just on cloudy days that the atomic clock would not function right, but even on sunny days with clear skies, I cannot get the right time. I would not recommend buying this product."
2,what time is it ???,"I would have put 5 stars if the Atomic part worked.Since they changed the timing of the daylight savings time this year 2007, the clock was not able to get the right time. I have to manually adjust it, and cannot get it to move past 8 am. Unfortunately, I have to order another one as it belongs in a conference room opposite end from the other one."
3,not as good as I hoped,I thought this would be similar to Ghost adventures or ghost hunters but I was disappointed. It was okay but I would dig a little more about each episode.
5,Haynes Manual,"This was a good product, it had typical mechanic stuff on it, but that was said in the sell. Great seller!!!!"
5,Practical with easy exercises to make it to the astral,"Get simple, practical exercises to experience the astral for yourself. Exercises include improving concentration, achieving the split with different techniques, protection from negative entities, remembering dreams, waking up in dreams, and others.Also included is a general dream symbol guide, to help you understand the content of your dreams.Highly recommended!"
5,Profoundly Simple!,"If you are looking for something that will totally open your eyes to experiencing the multi-dimensionality of life, Astral Projection is what you need. And to learn to do it, this book is a must! I've read a ton of literature on Astral Projection and was getting exhausted by all of the useless theories that seems to surround subjects like this. When I came across the online courses, I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was explained. With practice, I was able to finally experience it for myself.If you want to project, all you have to do is follow the authors directions to the t. It's as simple as that!"
1,Smoke and mirrors in the tradition of Orwellian propaganda.,"Barlett and Steele offer the polar opposite of ""feel good"" economics. Citing opinion polls and twisting economics statistics beyond recognition, they offer unconvincing proof of America's decline. This despite the contrary nature of the reality of the 1980s. An statistics professor once told me ""if you don't like what your data tells you, change the sample size"". In that tradition, Barlett and Steele lump in two declining economic periods (1977-81 and 1990) with the rest of the 1980s (the Reagan Era) to try and make their case more convincing. Fortunately, we have data available to see for ourselves the true nature of the Reagan Era"
2,anti-capitalist drivel,"If you're convinced that we'd have been better off as a socialist state with wealth redistribution run thought government instead of the private sector, this is for you.If you like to pretend that your lot in life is a result of the victimization of the masses at the hands of the wealthy, be my guest.If, however, have any knowledge of how market forces shape the world, forget this laughable bit of tripe from two Pulitzer Prize winners who must be waiting eagerly for the collapse of Western civilization -- right next to the guy with the ""Repent Now, Ye Sinners"" sign. It's essentially radical leftist propaganda of the funniest order."
4,The Dark Side Of The Floyd,"when i first spotted the disc ""Saucerful of Pink"", i was VERY skeptical. having been a floyd fan for the vast majority of my life, and owning bootlegs, and very rare items of the floyd, i felt that any attempts to ""industrialize"" the great band would have been laughable and an affront to fans. however, i gave the disc a listen to and was blown away. The cover of ""Jugband"" would have sent poor ol' Syd down the lysergic spiral once again. Mindwarpdrugrap, fnord. Calling this a ""goth"" floyd is greatly misleading. ""industrial"" would be a lot closer to the truth. i throughly enjoy this disc AND am a huge floyd freak! If you love the music of the band AND the evolution into which it is growing, buy this album. i wonder if they'll be another -- Skinny Puppy wasn't on here."
3,The Burying Field,"Dated mystery about racism in the south, mystery is captivating with several interesting twists, but racist, white antagonists are so one dimensional as to lack believability, the author comes across as a Grisham wantabe."
3,This is a pure descarga album,"A descarga is a Jam, basically allowing the musicians room to stretch and do what they want. The musicians here are great, but the band does not feel as tight as it could, there is not so much play between each of the musicians as there is each of them taking their turn doing their part in the jam.I really loved his Avion de la Salsa CD where everything came together. If you must have one of his albums, buy that one instead."
4,"Not straight up salsa, but good anyway ...","If you are looking for an album with straight up danceable salsa/son from start to finish this is probably not the album for you as there are only a couple of tracks which would fit into this description (Tracks 1/4/11). However, Jimmy Bosch is a huge talent and if you are looking for something a little different / a little innovative try this. Track 4 is a classic and was amongst my favourite tunes for many years. I also love track 6 which completely changes tempo half way through into a beautiful melody. Also a bonus with this cd is that it comes with an english translation of the lyrics, so us non-spanish speakers can get an idea of what he is singing about. For example, who would have guessed that Track 4 - with its highly danceable beat, would be so sad. Enjoy!"
1,No Subtitles/Closed-Captioning,"I saw Celtic Woman on PBS which was closed-captioned. Then decided to purchase the DVD.Guess what? No closed-captioning or subtitles!No wonder Amazon's listing doesn't say about closed-captioning or subtitles.Their show ranked a 5 but I'm giving it a 1 because I can't enjoy it.Oh well, back to the store it goes for a refund. Will this get Manhattan Record's attention now?"
5,What a surprise !,"Saw it on PBS ! Fresh and exciting ! I got the DVD + the CD. Love it. If enough people would know about it, I am sure it would be a chart topper. Finally something refreshingly new in this world of boring CD's."
5,Celtic Woman,"A great CD, nicely put together and a pleasure to listen too, a must for anyone who loves good music whether you like easy listening or looking for celtic music."
5,Excelente Concierto,"Celtic Woman es un extraordinario concierto, en donde se presentan 5 voces Irlandesas, cantando canciones como ""Orinoco Flow"" ""May it Be"" al estilo de Enya.5 Hermosas cantantes, 5 Voces angelicales = 5 Estrellas a este concierto. Muuy Recomendable.Fernando Martinez, S.L.P., Mexico."
2,More like lullabies for grownups....,"Had to see what all the buzz was about when getting this CD for my wife for Christmas. I was not overly impressed. 80% of the songs on this album have an orchestal accompanyment rather than a celtic one. ""May It Be"" is nicely done in celtic musical style, but the rest of this album is forgetable. TRUE celtic music can easily be found elsewhere, and if you are looking for it here, like me you will be sorely disappointed. The magical music of Secret Garden or Yanni makes Celtic Woman look amateurish and very cheesy by comparison. Sorry, these babes just don't do it for me. Worthy of 2 stars, and that's being generous."
1,PBS scores!,"This CD is an excellent example of why some of us have stopped contributing to PBS. Why do I bother to review something I find so irrelevant? Only because the term ""classical"" is used by the Amazon reviewer and others. There is nothing remotely approaching classical music in this compilation of dental office Muzak; no potential buyer should be conned into thinking there's classical music here. Even Lawrence Welk would have been ashamed to put his name on drivel like this."
3,beautiful but sound is detracting,"The DVD has beautiful visuals and the voices are great. However, there is so much distortion in the audio that it's quite distracting and detracts from the overall experience. I'd recommend the DVD, but wish they would put better quality control into creating it."
3,Only the women are Celtic,"After seeing a Celtic Woman Christmas on TV, my wife wanted more of the type of music, so for Christmas I got the frist Celtic Woman CD. Apparantly the women are celtic and mot the music. since we were expecting celtic songs and much of the CD is not celtic, we were disappointed. The singing is good and the recording is good. There realy isn't any dancing or muh movement, so it's all about the songs. If you want Celtic music, buy something else. If you want a variety of songs and music by some talented women singers, then this is not a bad choice."
5,Review of Celtic Woman -,The music on this CD definitely takes one to another time and another place - a musical treat for the ears. Each one of the five performers is over the top in talent and performance and the accompanying band (orchestra) is rich and full.
5,Superb to the core!,"If you like something soothing to the soul, buy this DVD and CD. I can listen to it 24/7 and not get tired. Their voices are like heaven's angels singing to us. I am so happy to have received this as a gift and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves music that is soothing. Reminds me of Enya in some ways but a different style and very enjoyable."
5,Pure Delight for the ears,"I have just discovered an appreciation for Celtic Music and this CD is the reason. After seeing and hearing Celtic Women on PBS I had to have more. Purity of voice, absolute delightful selections and a broadening of my musical appreciation to new vistas make this one of my favorites."
1,Celtic Woman Review,"I absolutely love the music on this CD,except when it came to the seventh track. The music would not play at all.Apparently the CD is defective and if I ship it back it will cost me twice what it is worth. Very disappointed in this product. Will not order from this site again."
2,Live or pre-recorded?,"I have watched the ""Celtic Woman"" DVD concert several times and I have very serious reservations about the singer's vocals actually being live. It certainly seems that they are actually lip-synching to pre-recorded tracks. Observe carefully, and you will see there are many times when the sound of the voices do not match the gesticulations of the singers' lips and mouths. This would explain the lack of animation on part of the singers, and also the artificial, melodramatic tone of their facial expressions as they 'sing'. It's a total misrepresentation, and a shame."
5,Great C.D. Good shipping time.,"Product as represented, good shipping time. This was a Christmas present for my step-mother who loves Celtic music. I bought it specifically because it had a lovely recording of a version of ""Isle of Inisfree"" which she and my father fell in love with after watching the John Wayne film set in Ireland, ""The Quiet Man."" I've since been told my step-mother enjoys listening to it while in the bath. Perfect gift for a Celtic music lover."
1,Nice Lip Syncing.,"There are no real performances here. Pretty ladies standing there not actually singing. Kinda boring. Music is fine if you like Celtic Yanni, but there's no reason to watch as there is no actual singing. If you are older, or don't feel like quality in music performance matters, perhaps you can overlook this... looks like many people have. Fake."
5,Angelic Concert,"Having seen this on PBS during their fund-raising period, I couldn't wait to buy it on DVD. We recently bought a new Chrysler Town & Country minivan with a DVD Mobile Theater built in. Since I don't have a home theater system, I tried this out in the van on a day trip the other day. What an experience! Being the driver, I couldn't see the concert, but didn't need to because it can stand alone as a wonderful experience without any visuals. The surround sound mix is glorious and the angelic voices of all the singers must be experienced to believe.It's my favorite concert DVD now, and if not for the gas price problem, I'd wish I had a longer commute! True music aficionados should run, not walk to buy this DVD."
4,Heavy duty car floor mats,"The best thing about these floor mats is that they are heavy duty compared to some other flimsy ones I have had. Also, they do not have grid-like tops where salt, dirt, and sand tend to get stuck from your shoes. They have a smooth plastic on top. My car is blue, and I also have matching tinkerbell steering wheel and back seat floor mats so its looks great!"
3,Good,Good story. Liked the characters but very predictable. Although I was more interested in the mystery part than the romance part.
2,incorrect movie,"I ordered this and received the disc on June 1-- the box and disc were labelled-- Park Row-- it is a fine movie and until now not avsailable on DVD-- but when I put the disc in to play-- it was not Park Row-- the movie on the disc is ""harry in the pocket"" a james coburn movie-- something is screwed up here-- love to know how to get the movie."
3,Citizen Kane with FEEELING!,"such a treasure of history of late 19th century newspaper business, Sam took on the whole enchilada with impressive results! Some technical detail that was hard to appreciate, Mergenthaler's Linotype machine seemed surreal and the tactics utilized by competitors demonstrates the guerilla warfare typically employed by smaller dictatorships to remain in control... surprised the ending alluded to the goodwill of man, (or in this case woman), with talent and hard work prevailing... high recommend for printing press tech and overcoming many odds to achieve a dream..."
2,I will not read Susan Johnson again,"I do not recommend this book. The story has potiential to develop quite alright. However, it never takes off - probably because the author feels that she has to have the mandatory number of pages of love scenes, which are many but with one or two exeptions, not very good. This is the first book I have read of this author. I chose this one because it is supposed to be one of the best. Fearing that other books will be worse than this one, I am will not read a ms Johnson again. Read Stephanie Laurens, eary Amanda Quick or Loretta Chase instead."
4,Sexy & Romantic!,"This is ine of the best SJ novels I have read, in fact my favourite after Brazen.Johnie has a hard time commiting to Elizabeth and fools around with a lot of women in the first half, but once he marries Liz, becomes a devoted and faithful husband, and the story turns very romantic.The only problem I had was with the last part of the book, as the attention shifts to Johnie's brother and his lover, who are the protagonists of the sequel to this novel.Other than that, the book was very erotic as well as romantic."
3,if you liked gooebumps,this if the frist book i read in rl stimnes new serires. I like pretty well. I always loved the goosebumps so this is pretty simalar. I found it very supnsfull even though i gussed the end.
1,Soft Metal,"Very poor quality, metal on shank is soft and bends under hard use. Also blade is a cheap stamping. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
2,Not as advertised,"THIS WHISTLE IS NOT BLACK AS PICTURED AND DESCRIBED, ITS BRIGHT ORANGE. I had to contact the seller to get my money back (which they did.) It only gets 2 stars because the seller refunded my money without having to file an a-z claim. Seller stated they would change the listing to show that it was orange, they still claim its black. This is dishonest advertising and in some states its ILLEGAL. Avoid this seller like the plague."
1,I want my money back,"Pump leaks so bad that it is not safe to use on the boat dock, not at the connections but in the pump itself. When you attach it to the pump nozzel it becomes heavy and hard to use. last thing, with 20 gallons of gas in the unit it two people in excess of 30 min to pump it all out and we were both wore out from turning the handle. (Save your money) and buy the gas at the boat dock .......... wish I could get my money and time back .. anybody wants to buy the entire set up ?? I will sell it all for half what I have in in it $250 and this leaker is yours."
1,Returned and swapped twice so far and it still leaks,"This is not a safe product, both pumps have leaked from the pump body, it scary that a company that handles gas storage and pumping products even put this out on the market. If Amazon would let this review go through with zero stars it would rate that."
1,This Is A Total Ripoff!~!!,"The picture shown of the robot is false advertising!! Beware, there are 6 figures, and you only get 1 at random. The 5 non-robot ones look totally lame!!! I got a 3"" tall half-body terminator (arnold version) that was nowhere near good enough to display. The odds of getting the robot are not worth the risk of buying 5 lame ones. I will be posting a pic of the lame ones so you can see. Buyer beware."
3,Great for a gift whom collects moive and tv items.,My review for the item purchase was a collection of movie items and is neat for a gift for one to collect.
5,Your heart will soar!,"This is a wonderful, wonderful book showcasing fine art from museums all across America, in exquisite full-color detail, with fabulous insight from one of the most intelligent minds of our time--Sister Wendy Beckett. If you have seen her PBS specials, you will know just what a treasure she is to the art world. She has a well-cultivated eye for detail, yet instead of being just another critic, is able to convey to people of all ages and backgrounds just what it is that she finds so special about great art masterpieces. And through her words, you can learn what it means to truly appreciate art. This is a fantastic addition to any collection and an excellent gift choice for the holidays ahead."
2,EVER HEAR OF TREBLE?,"As previous reviews have pointed out the mix on this cd is absolutely horrible. The guitar is so muddy it's flat out annoying to listen to. Someone either didn't know there was a treble knob on the amp, tone knobs on the guitar or how to operate a mixing board. Go get Pat's early solo cd's like El Hombre or East; you can't go wrong with either one. Producers and engineers of today's jazz music could learn alot by picking up any of Rudy Van Gelders engineered Blue Note and Pretige recordings."
2,"Blah, Blah","The first 2 movies were terrific. The directors should have stopped right there. This one is a real snoozer, poorly written and far, far inferior to the first 2. Wish I had not watched it!"
3,Good for Extract Brewers,"Not a bad recipe book, but I'd say much more valuable to extract brewers as over half are extract recipes. I've definitely gotten some good ideas from it, but was a bit disappointed there weren't more all-grain recipes. There are only a few that I have any interest in brewing. Still it serves as a good reference when developing a new recipe. Most of all it's interesting to see what recipes other homebrewers have had success with."
4,Another great cd from JD.,"Jimmy Dawkins continues to make fine CD's and his latest, his second on Fedora Records, is a very fine cd. Recorded in California, it finds Dawkins backed by a basic guitar-organ-bass-drums combo and going through a varied set of songs. There's the slow blues (""Falling Tears"", ""Mean Ole Blues"") that Dawkins is a master of, but he also does well on up-tempo songs like the Magic Sam-style ""Mid Nite Boogie"". There is also a very fast instrumental, ""Kotten Field Jump"", a style of song that Dawkins has used many times before.Once again, Jimmy Dawkins comes up with another fine CD to add to his fairly large discography. This one, while not at the same level as his album's for Delmark, is a fine showcase for his trademark style and fans of his will not be disappointed with this release"
1,Not worth the time,"Good example of airy-fairy, overproduced Celtic pap. With all the excellent, distinctive Celtic influenced music available, this is a waste of time & money. Overproduced, over effected, overcompressed vocals barely distinguishable from mediocre backing musicians. The only thing that sets this apart from the current mish-mash of ""Celtic"" pop is that it's sung in Welsh. The worst characteristics of Enya & Anuna combined."
1,Cheap plastic arrives pre-scratched!,"I have the same problem than the review below. carefully opened the packaging and to my surprise found the protector had 1 deep gouges and about a dozen minor scratches all over the cheap plastic surface. Sure this thing will protect your glossy PSP screen from new scratches, but the scratches on the gameshield sure make the PSP look like it has already taken a beating."
1,Worst Movie of All Time,"I don't know how this movie averaged three stars. This movie doesn't even warrant 1/2 a star. I never write movie reviews, but this movie was so bad (the worst I ever saw) I felt compelled to, just to let people know not to waste their money (either renting or buying)."
1,HORRIBLE,"Dreadful movie. This was a C-grade horror movie at best. The title is misleading as the lead character never dies. I wonder If Lindsay knew what she was getting into when she agreed to star in this disjointed and convoluted film. Personally I think she was exploited. Sexual scenes that are unnecessary, limbs falling off spontaneously, blood guts and gore, Oh my. Wish I had passed on this one- ugh!"
2,It's a Reach,"There have been so many movies and TV series produced in the last decade or so that feature the brutal murders of young women, it's difficult for any of them to come up with a novel twist. This movie goes out on a limb trying to reach for some new solution. You have to suspend your disbelief somewhat and be tolerant of some loose ends and muddle in order to buy what's happened here. But the basic idea raises some interesting questions.This movie also tries to distinguish itself with a couple of protracted pole-dancing scenes. These scenes would have been even more protracted but for some sensible use of the cutting room floor. If you are holding a bachelor party, you might want to check out the complete erotic dance sequence in the DVD bonus materials. Otherwise, the amount of terpsichore and torture that are left in the film, tip it dangerously close to exploitation."
1,My Advice: Skip It,"I was in the mood for a little Lifetime movie last night and this was on. My advice for anyone in that boat: Don't waste your time on this one. It is a stinker. Lindsay Lohan used to be a cute, kind of fun actress in her younger days, and from watching this, I can't even imagine what's happened to her. This is one ugly film. It doesn't make any sense, the acting and writing is drivel at best, the movie is really dark and disgusting with very little redemptive value as to the time spent watching it. I admit, I didn't finish watching it, but I am so glad I had better judgement and turned it off-I watched enough to realize that this movie is just a gross, bad way to spend any amount of time. Some Lifetime movies are mindless entertainment to while a way an hour or two in bliss while eating a few snacks and having tea or whatever, but this one should be avoided as being one of the stupidest movies made-even for the Lifetime network's standard of movies."
2,A Guy's Review,"Here's what I'd like to say. First of all I hate the fact that it's always violence against women. Second of all,this movie showed me one thing, be carefull who you trust with your kids or with yourself. Third of all, watching this movie made me decide to find a movie where MEN are tortured for a change. If there's a movie like that, I'll find it and rent it. I love women. I think violence against women is overused."
2,Liked it till the end,"I was not expecting this movie to be fantastic going into it. I am not a Lindsay Lohan fan. I bought it as an impulse buy at the store mainly for a good laugh. I put the movie in and to my surprise I actually was enjoying the movie. The acting was way better then I thought and seemed to have a decent story to go along with it... that is till the end. Now, I am not going to give this away but they ending was horrible. I am normally not the type of person to dislike a movie if it is not realistic, I mean it is a movie, but this movie's ending (last 30-40 minutes) was just so retarded it made me have a very strong distaste for the whole movie. On a side note, the alternate ending was I feel a better way to end it."
1,HORRIBLE SERVICE,My product came more than a month later than I ordered!When I emailed them they didn't respond until I emailed them a second time. HORRIBLE SERVICE. Definitely not recommended to other customers.
3,it's ok,"this was a tester sample, which I didn't realize, and it smelled ok, but it burned my skin when first putting it on. Definitely a perfume for a younger person. I am almost thirty, and well not something I will purchase again."
1,HUGE disappointment,"Since the information does not say anything about color,I was assumed the color was same as the photo...butit was solid navy!Since it was a present, I gave up to return it.I was REALLY disappointed. Unless you don't care aboutcolor, I don't recommend to order this product."
2,I Know These People And Don't Like Them,"I had to take two breaks from this book but kept returning. What I both liked and disliked about it is its Italianness. I loved that it felt authentic to its core and I liked the writing. I recognized the people from my own family and by their resemblance to friends who were born in Italy. This is not an American Italian story, it is Italian through and through. There is a lot of old world petty intrigue, hysteria, machismo, ignorance, manipulation, insinuation, stiffling class and gender boundaries, a touch of politics (but of course). Reading this book reminded me how much I disliked my uncles Vito and Sal. Glad I read it, though."
1,Rubbish,"I attempted to read this book several years ago and found it to be utter rubbish!! This book is worthy of the ""National Enquirer"" as opposed to a serious biography of Heinrich Himmler. Himmler is a subject worthy of a biography for his infamous career but Padfield's work is so full of inaccuracies on so many levels I tossed the book in the trash after the first few chapters it was so bad.A better but not nearly as lengthy biography can be found in Heinz Hoehne's ""The Order of the Deaths Head."" This book however is nonsense."
4,boring,"They were normal men and women, who lived in a very contentious time in Germany and did the wrong thing. They were not ""evil"", they did things that were evil. Just as bad things happen to good people, good people do BAD things.Himmler was not ""evil"", he believed in Hitler. What he did was evil, and he, as he should be, is held by most of the civilized world as a criminal.The deeper I went into this book, the more unbelievable I found it to be. It is amazing that people still write from a Marxist perspective, that capital is the primary motive of history. According to this book, it was the landed Junkers vs the Capitalist industialist that led the NAZI's into war and policy formation. The deeper I got into the book, the less I cared for what was being presented, and the more I wanted a biography on Himmler and less of a preaching of Marxist theory on world history!"
1,Rip off postage fee,"The cheat sheet is somewhat usable, but I hatebeing totally ripped off. When an item can bemailed with a 39-cent postage stamp, why would youallow a vendor to treat your clients this way?Also, the print is too small to actually readwithout a magnifying glass."
2,Pricey,"It wasn't as good as I would expect it to be. I thought it would give you some awesome hints of how to use the camerea to make it easy. But it's basically the same thing as in the book that comes with the camera. And I also thought it was a book, but it's not a book. I found it very pricey for what it's suppose to do.."
1,Poorly written,"This is one of the most poorly written technical manuals I have ever used. The tone of the book is patronizing and the cost too high. The three book series (user manual, tech manual and ""loaded"" version) should have been condensed into one clean book. The print quality is really bad, it looks like it was printed on a very old laser printer. I can't see how the author sleeps at night knowing this garbage is going out with their name on it.Where is O'Reilly when you need them?"
3,"Looks great, average quality","I purchased 4 of these at a time to replace an old impulse clock system setup, and 2 of the 4 clocks had the issue where the second hand would stop moving. It still kept time correctly, just without the second hand. I am going to attempt to contact La Crosse directly and see about a warranty."
1,La Crosse is disappointing,"Clock got the time correctly, once. After one day it failed totally. The hands now point to 6:30 ( totally fell to the bottom ). Put in a new battery - still defective. Moved the clock to a different location with no improvement. Unfortunately, this is not the first La Cross clock to fail. There is no reason to ever purchase a La Crosse product in the future! NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY TO SHIP IT BACK."
1,Hands misaligned,"The minute hand of this clock arrived misaligned, so that clock always shows the time 3-4 minutes behind the actual time.I contacted the manufacturer (e-mail to customer service remained unanswered for 3 days, so I had to telephone). They said they would repair the faulty clock, but refused to pay for shipping (their claims is the the minute hand could have shifted in shipping --- since the hands are balanced in the spindle, this possibility is highly unlikely).Since Lacrosse clearly has manufacturing issues (other customers report similar misalignment issues), and has poor customer service, you might want to look at a different manufacturer. Even though I am returning the clock to Amazon, which knows how to treat their customers correctly, this is another of life's little hassles."
1,Hour and Minute Hands Work Great!,Seemed like a very nice clock when it arrived. Easy to set up. Unfortunatly the second hand quit working after about a week.
2,Obsolete Daylight Saving Time.,"My clock was programmed with the previous version of the Daylight Saving Time rules, so it was off by an hour. This clock won't allow you to jog the hour forward or backwards, so unless you live in the central states you are out of luck. I tossed my clock out."
3,I have purchased 4 of these for our office,Since we seem to have trouble keeping all the clocks in the office with the correct time we purchased 4 of these clocks. They arrived fine. I put the battery in and held down the EST button on the back. Each of them moved to 4:00. But it was 2:15 in the afternoon. Okay I thought - give it overnight to sinc up. No go. Moved them to a different office so it could sinc up. This did happen but it took 2 more days. Since then they are working fine. Very nice clocks for the money. I would recommend.
2,Second hand,"As others have stated on this review forum, the second hand died after a few months, alth' the clock kept correct time,I would not buy from LaCrosse again, nor would I suggest to anyone"
5,Great value - and soft,"These towels are really soft as the other reviewer said, and the bath towels are nice and big. A good buy for 14.99 in the sale. Don't know if I'd step up to the 19.99 they're going for now though."
2,"Really hard rubber, difficult to play with insideT",My Jack Russell Terrier or Terror as we refer to him loves new balls especially those that bounce irregularly. This ball was just too hard to play with inside and even a little big for our 17 lb dog. Really disappointed with this toy.
4,Useful!,"As long as it isn't a huge problem and you are good at diagnosing the problem,these manuals can really help. It def saves you from having to shell out all the cash on a garage for the little things."
1,very late,I bought this product using the most expensive mailing service because I needed it urgently. It was expected to arrive on the 7th of March and today the 11th hasn't arrived yet. It's outrageous!
3,Good,"Given its a first feature, it is understandable for the holes in story. But overall an interesting look into the subject of love."
4,Always exciting to see Linda put out a new album,"As a major fan of Linda's since her Star Search '88 days, it's always thrilling to get her new releases. She does have a remarkable voice and sings fabulously with a big band backup or just a piano accompanying her. I do have to say that I was slightly disappointed in this new release though - as others have said, it sounds all too much like some of her earlier work. I don't want to trash Frank, but I think Linda needs to stop being the vehicle for ALL his music. She does need to branch out more and try some different things. Personally, the songs I love the most of hers are the slower tunes (Why do People Fall In Love, This Time Around, etc). The fast-tempo, big band songs are great but I thinks it's tiring to listen to them after awhile. While this CD is still great, I think It's Time and And So Much More were better. But still, It's No Secret Anymore IS a must-have!I think she should put out an album of her Star Search songs one of these days!"
4,She has great potential,"Linda has lovely voice - sometimes highs too strong and wish she would sing more mainstream songs, but she has nice delivery. If you like Linda Eder, you'll LOVE Jane Olivor."
1,You get what you pay for,"I ordered this a couple months ago as a backup battery and only used it a few times. It worked just fine until a coupe days ago, it wont hold a charge at all now.Im not sure if I got a defective one or what, but because it has been more than 30 days I cant return it. Oh well, it was only like $9.00."
4,Excellent,"i love this cd because it decribes my life completely exspecially the song intitled ""Mr.to damn good' that reminds me of me and my boyfriend, but any ways, Gerald Levert is a wonderful singer! Jessica Simms"
3,Powerful Performer saddled With Mediocre Material,"Gerald Levert, a singer blessed with a superb vocal delivery inherited from legendary O'Jay Eddie Levert, suffers from the plague effecting many of contemporary artists: equating SEX with LOVE and ROMANCE. The majority of cuts on this release deal with just ""doing it"" and the rest touch on failed relationships.I am not a prude by any stretch of the imagination, but the album devotes too much time to the ""act"" as opposed to the emotions and character involved in forging a bond between individuals.Maybe I am just too ""old,"" having been raised on many of the Motown classics and standards of earlier years.In fact, the son should, perhaps, listen to the music of the father! Eddie was a CLASS ACT!"
1,A tango mess,"A really boring film, a rare exemple of presumption. Sally Potter dancing tango reminds of Vanessa Redgrave's Isadora Duncan, all elbows and knees. If you love tango, you'll avoid it."
3,Fun and moving,"Not only is the world of Tango documented but the personal interaction of the players with emotions, heartbreak, and the will to master their art form."
5,I Love This Movie!,"I have not been able to buy The Tango Lesson locally, but have rented it several times. I really can't give a considered review, because I always become very emotionally involved with it. Firstly, I have always loved dancing, and wish I could have learnt the tango in my energetic youth. Now I feel I might just fall down! Secondly, I think Pablo Veron is gorgeous, and Sally Potter is a mixture of strength and femininity, being both intelligent and caring. I suppose the story line is simple and pared back, but oh, the lovely dancing from all concerned, and the depth of feeling that is there!"
3,Could have been a great product ...,"This product could have been great had the manufacturer taken more care on the little zippers. The zipper handle has been glued to the zipper ( i wish they should have gone for some other technique) with some sort of gel, and on the very first use, the zipper handle came off and i had to return it and get a replacement.Except this the bag itself is very nice and of good quality."
2,Recipes are inaccurate,"First as another reviewer stated the salt to sugar ratios are off. Secondly the book tells you to smoke a brisket at 350 for about 1 hour per pound. I'm not an expert at smoking by any stretch of the imagination, but I know that brisket needs to be smoked low and slow, otherwise tough brisket and a ruined meal. I also have a problem with adding liquid smoke to recipes as a couple in this book have, it seems to have a chemical aftertaste. The game recipes are scant with only one for venison. I do like the tables in the back for brining and smoking times. If you want a book that gives a little information on everything with some interesting recipes go ahead and buy it. If you want a book that teaches you the art of smoking this one isn't for you."
3,"Great sound, but not very durable","I tried several other devices, including the iTrip, and this one has the best sound quality and signal strength by far. However, it only lasted six months before both the power cord and the sound jack failed. Because of the low price, I'll probably replace it with another McCally because of the sound quality and relatively low price. However, like the other reviewer, I'll be sure to keep my warranty and receipt records on the next purchase."
1,"Good value, OK sound quality, but HORRIBLE CONSTRUCTION!","Even though I was happy with the features and number of amenities that came with this transmitter, and even though its sound quality was okay, I have to give it a 1-star rating because I was not able to enjoy it for long due to the fact that it broke in half while I was taking it out of the car outlet about a month after I got it. Shoddy construction! And therefore a complete waste of money, unfortunately..."
2,Too easy to solve and half the book is boring,"This is my third Heyer book and so far it's the most disappointing. The first half of the book is whimsical, getting to know the characters and their foibles. The second half of the book is almost solely an inspector interviewing each character about the events in the first half of the book. Equally annoying is that the solution is very easy (I knew as soon as they found the 'unfinished clue' who it would be) and at the same time, the reader isn't given the data to confirm the solution until the unveiling of the murderer. I would definitely recommend reading a different Heyer mystery."
3,NOT BAD FOR ANIMATION VERSION,"As animation goes this wasn't too bad. I was a huge fan of the old computer video game of this, in which Mark Hamil, John Rhys Davies, and Malcom McDowel actually stared. It was one of the early games that actually used real actors for the characters and didn't have them CGI. In this animation they did use Mark & Malcom for the voice overs. I had never seen this series on TV but looks to be at least 2 to 3 seasons long. For those of you who are fans of this game, you might also want to take a look at ""WING COMMANDER"" with Freddie Prinze Jr. It was also very well done and true to the game.Wing Commander"
1,Confusing,"I found this book hard to follow. It was unclear to me who the audience was, it switched back and fourth between talking to children, spouses and servicemen. As a wife, it was hard to relate to anything in the book because I didn't feel as if the book was meant for me to read. It does have some interesting information, but nothing you can't find elsewhere."
3,Great Insight into the Fight,"Both Ali and Frazier are fascinating sports figures as this book demonstrates exceedingly well. The writing can be a bit sloppy in some places, but one gains a great sense of understanding for the fight from this book. Neither boxer was the same after they battled over the years."
5,"sometimes, the truth hurts","This was a really good read that didnt change my mind about Ali because I already knew what kind of man he was and have always been horrified by his treatment of Frazier and his other antics. The bottom line is that Ali wasnt a good guy. I mean the sports media celebrates his psychological warfare with opponents while ignoring the fact that he destroyed the reputation and pride of poeple like Joe Frazier along the way. Ali is the greatest heavyweight of all time, but hardly a role model."
1,the author is bitter and biased,"The reader will get the sense that the author Mark Kram is bitter and filled with contempt. He shrewdly attempts to downgrade Ali's essence simply because of his hidden racist ideologies. Don't buy it, there are many amazing books on Muhammad Ali, written by people who can absorb what Ali emanates and can put that into writing. But this one should be forgotten. He claims that Ali is NOT a hero because he hasn't done anything worthy of that title. So to read an entire book from an author who has no understanding of what makes a human being larger than life is a waste of money and time."
3,blu ray quality,"I have never written a review on anything,but the blu ray quality on this series is so poor I wanted to let others know before they buy it.I would say it even looks worse than a regular dvd quality video."
4,Nice book,"This is a cute little book that has nice little rhyming verses on each page. My little boy doesn't seem too impressed with it, but I think as he gets older, he'll like it better. I think it's very sweet."
1,Extremely out of date,"This book is extremely out of date as it was published in 2008. Some school reviews have not been updated for years. If you want a peek, get it from the library or borrow from a parent who has already gone through the middle school process in a previous year. You can also get most of the info on the insideschools.org, and even more updated info from the DOE statistics, greatschools.com and [...]. Buying this book is a waste of money."
3,It all started with tego,"My fling with regaetton (possibly temporary) started with Tego Calderon's ""Metele Sazon"", which is a great song. I'm not hispanic/latina/whatever and I don't speak more than a handful of Spanish (mostly bad words) but I'm hooked on regaetton. It's not for everyone (better that way) and it sounds really good with the volume turned up. My only complaint is there should have been a larger female presence (beside the orgasmic moaning, I mean...you know, rapping). It seems like Glory always represents the ""girlas"" and that's it. How about the ""girlas"" have more support so they can represent themselves? Okay, speaking off the soap box, I recommend this collection to most people with a pulse.Standout tracks were: Metele sazon, hay algo en ti, bailando provocas, tu me pones mal, tu sabes, te quiero ver."
1,Not as represented!,"I specifically ordered this retractable leash because it said it was a ""tape"" leash. Before it was shipped I emailed the company and asked them to let me know for sure this was indeed a ""tape"" leash and NOT a ""cord"" leash, as I did NOT want a ""cord"" leash. They emailed me back assuring me it was a ""tape"" leash.Well, guess what I got? There is about a foot of ""tape"" on first part of the leash, the rest of the 15 feet or so is ""CORD""!! I emailed them and told them I got the ""cord"" leash and they wrote back and said that is the one I ordered! Now if you look at the ad for this, it says ""TAPE"" leash.... I will NEVER order anything from this company again!"
3,"Does the job, but seems like it's very overpriced","When it comes to rack-mounting my Sennheiser transmitters and receivers, I needed these cables. The cables are easy to use and work perfectly, but that's to be expected when they are made for the exact purpose I'm using them for... My only complaint is that the price seems outrageous for what these are--a length of cable with some sort of antenna adapter at each end. It seems there is only a couple dollars worth of potential parts here, with a very high mark-up applied to the finished product, when I've already shelled out a good bit of money for the awesome Sennheiser gear it's going on. But, at the end of the day, I needed it and it gets the job done."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to order these for my new home, however when I recieved them, I was disappointed in the print on the coasters. The colors dont come through much and it looks more like a dark smear of color. You really have to study it to see the dragonfly and the colors are very bland...nothing like the vivid colors/contrast represented in the pictures here.On a more positive note, the size is very nice and the materials used for absorption are very effective. If you want highly functional products, this is for you. However, if you want something pretty, choose a different set."
1,Not Good for me.,"I have large ankles, legs and feet. I couldn't get it to fit at all even though I bought a much larger size."
5,Jump like Jordan again,"At 50+ most of us have no business playing basketball. I jump like Jordan (Sparks), shake like Magic (Fingers), and twist my ankles more than Chubby Checker. But lace these miracle braces up, and I'm ready to hobble up and down the floor. Beats other braces: tape is messy, elastic gives no support, and more rigid systems lack flexibility. Even my high school-age son started using them for football. They really give the right combination of stiffness and flexibility, and you can modify the support with 2 plastic inserts. I've used them for 15 years, and NEVER ONCE turned over an ankle! Extend your glorious career. Get 'em, and I guarantee you'll be able to take down J.R. (Ewing). (Now, if they only made something for my knees...)"
4,Great support.,"I purchased this brace specifically for basketball. After about 4 months with it, I haven't twisted or tweaked my ankle once. Only complaint is that you need to have plenty of room in your shoe to accommodate the brace. You may want to go up half a size if your shoes fits a bit snug."
3,immunology text,"this text is widely used my medical schools, however is is long-winded in its descriptions, which sometimes makes the key ideas appear elusive. i give it 3 stars"
5,Great book,"This book was well written, easy to understand, and had good diagrams and tables. I highly recommend this book as someone who had never taken Immunology."
3,What happened!,"This is not what I expected. The beats are a little chezzy and not enough Joe and Pun. The first five tracks are good and relaxing and Rude Boy Salute is hot to def but other tracks got you scratching your heads thinking huh. I ws so eager to get the album until I got it and now it is collecting dust. Anyway, Terror Squad is the group and they are going to put some realness always. Just this album needs work. They got skills but this album is going to have people who don't know hip hop think they are underrated."
4,Surprisingly good,"When Paul just released creamfields, I thought: ""here we go again..."" Considering that Paul was putting Justin Timberlake and Madonna and bunch of other garbage on his mixes, I thought that creamfields was going to be another sold out mainstream mix. Sure, there is a remix out of the remix of the old remix of U2, but overall the entire mix is pretty damn good. I have been listening to it for months and continue to come back, which proves that it has got to be really good (to my tastes). The music really flows, melodic and almost even soothing with pleasant vocals."
3,Oakie's return to Cream,"Pretty decent album with some nice tracks on it. It seems after Oakenfold finished experimenting with pop trash, he goes back to the basics and delivers some melodic trance to lay down a foot on the electronic scene. It seems Oakenfold has missed alot since his experimentation, and alot of have things have changed. Trance seems to be a dying breed, but many artists have flourished with its so called demise. Oakenfold has taken a backseat to the likes of Van Buuren and Tiesto. If you want quality trance, go with Van Buuren and djs like Markus Schultz. They seem to still have a pulse on the trance scene while oakenfold is trying to bring back something that is not here. ANyways, this cd is not bad by any means, but there is better stuff out there. It definitely is his best work in recent years, and its good to hear Oakenfold is back on track to what he became great for."
1,what a junk...,"Mr. Oakenfold has to release something every once for a while just to keep his cash flow steady, the ""The great China Wall"" was decent but this one is way below average..."
5,One of Oakey's Best,"This double disc set is simply amazing. The first disc is more mellowish trance with some finely tuned Oakenfold rhythms. The opening song ""Point Zero"" is just plain beautiful, as well as songs such as Tilt's ""12"", ""Living The Dream"" and Oakey's own ""Como Tu (Oakenfold Mix). The second disc is more uplifting and very dancish. From the opening song to the ending song, this is music that will guarantee to keep you moving. It's got Oakey's incredible style that fans loved especially from his Tranceport days. This album just goes to show that Oakey is still the best DJ."
2,No Japanese Track?!,"I got this, and the first thing I tried to do was watch it in Japanese, only to find no Japanese language track! Why does the BLUERAY edition have LESS features than the DVD?!I'm selling this and buying the DVD version. Buyer beware - only get this if you like watching dubs!This is getting two stars only because the collection is still very high quality."
2,Very unoriginal....,"Very unoriginal, and as you read the book, R.L. Stine's ""I Am Your Evil Twin"" keeps popping in your mind. A little scary, but nothing horrorfying."
5,Informative biography and excellent essays,"This book covers a lot of ground. The educational background of L. Ron Hubbard, his views on children and education, and most importantly, the basics of the study technology he developed.It's this - the last section - that every parent and teacher should become aquainted with.This is an invaluable book and I recommend it to anyone interested in the field of education."
1,Old and junk you should get the unarothorized eddition,this book lacks information it is one of the worst guides I have ever read.
1,It stinks!,"I cant begin to explain how bad this book is. It is impossible to follow, all the information is wrong, and it makes every thing sound so easy. Well I got news for you, it aint."
3,"only good for maps, not so much for battle info","First off, the game rocks the casba, i love it. i really liked the guide b/c it helped me find my way around, and get the Lv 4 limit breaks that i wouldn't have been able to get w/out it. but i never too their advice on the boss battles. tip for people with too much time on their hands, get up to at least leval 50 outside of the gold sauser before you go in it the first time. it was good for the mechanics, materia lists and such, but there are quite a few mistakes. and it does give away the story line. but its good for people like me who are in it for the play, not the story line. its good if you just want to beat it"
4,THIS BOOK RULES !,Okay.....this book rules but it had some mistakes and it did not print out all the enemy-skills.So i give it 4 stars.
2,Question.,I was wondering on where did you get the idea of killing and completly cutting Aeris out of the game and why?
2,Prose Voiceover,"I orginally wanted to read Nurkse's poetry to find out if he would be a person with whom I'd want to study poetry; I decided that with Nurkse, I would be studying prose with line breaks, and the kind of line breaks which leave prepositions at the start of the lines more times than should be found if one was an editor versed in poetics. The narrative nature of his poetry also lessens the poetic feel of his writing. There are some images that can stick in the mind long after a read, a darkness of sorts; however, some are cliche, like the mother crushing myrtle through her fingers . . . how many times have I read of someone (fill in name) manipulating (fill in verb) an herb (fill in name) with some part of the hand (fill in specific). It might be more interesting if nettles were the herb. Ouch!"
5,camcorder case,"This camcorder case has all the features I could want. On one zippered side of the case, the camcorder sits in a soft cradle sling. Under the sling is room for all of the connecting wires. I do not have to deal with the wires until I need them. On the other zippered side of the case is room for the instruction book as well as slots to hold an extra battery, mini-cd's and other items."
4,The Third Princess,"I think it is a great book. It recieved the Christopher Award. The book is about a third princess being born. Third princesses are always the most beautifull of the three. This little Rose isn't anything like that. At first she doesn't see anything of her self not being pretty until a prince comes riding by on a noble steed, she thinks back to her beauty. All princesses have fairy godmothers so all she wanted was beauty. Will she marry the prince or descover beauty is not the way to go?"
4,An Exciting Fairytale For All Ages!!!!!!!!!,"Usually princesses are beautiful....but not in this fairytale!!Instead, Rose has buckteeth, and short, stringy hair-hardly what you would expect a princess to look like.You won't be able to put down this book-or rather chestprotecter-Rose is much smarter than your usual beautiful fairytale princess.But when Prince Parsley visits Couscous to find a bride, everything changes and Eleanor(Rose's fairygodmother)turns Rose into the most beautiful princess ever!Choose between a Test and a Quest to turn Rose back to normal.You'll meet characters like Jasper, a Wiseman pretending to be a Fool, just to save Couscous from ignorance!In the story you'll meet characters beyond your imagination!You'll love this book more than any other book you've read in your life!"
3,Thoughtful But Short,"Kenneth Hagin has been 'worshiped,' 'adored,' 'slandered,' 'shunned,' and decried as a heretic.He has pretty much seen the whole spectrum of responses to his teachings and theology. That said, it was refreshing that none of those emotions come to play in this book.It's rather short, to-the-point and not very heavy in Theology which was refreshing at the time I was new in the faith but does little for me now.It's basic--good, but basic, though there are seemingly few scriptural examples for some of what he purports, which mean this tends to fall more long the line of theological application rather than theological principle.3 stars for Thoughtful But Short."
5,This is a hilarious CD!,"The Peeper is the best. The Cool Guys tracks were really funny, but Uncle Donny was hilarious. How come he never gets a grammy and Ricky Martin gets like 12? Share the wealth. Buy it."
2,Not very good,"I am a big fan of Adam Sandler's and when I found out I had a gift certificate to a music store, I went to get this CD. I'm glad I had the gift certificate because it would have been a waste of my money to buy an $18 CD for one good song. I LOVE the second Hanuka song but everything else was not impressive. If you can, get your hands on that one song but I don't recommend the whole CD. It just wasn't funny."
3,This is Adam?,"After having eagerly waited for Adam Sandler's latest comedy album to appear....I would have to say his latest album is a big letdown! This newest album is nowhere near as funny as his last two comedy skit albums. The ""Cool Guy"" skits? What the hell was that? It was slightly amusing but not funny. The ""Hot Water Burn Baby"" bit? Again...what the hell was that? Amusing but defintely not on the same level as Adam's true talent. Stardom has hit Adam Sandler the wrong way. The more famous he gets the less funny he seems to be. Sorry but buyer beware....this album is not that great. Especially when you compare it to anything else he has done in the past. Save your money and get Adam's ""They're All Gonna Laugh At You!"" or ""What The Hell Happened To Me"" if you haven't already done so. Now those albums were absolutely hysterical!"
3,"Not his best, not enough ""kodak"" moments,","the conclusion to ""hot water burn baby"" was not funny, the cool guys stopped being funny after the third hearing, and ""the champion"" was just not up to his standards. All that aside, there were a few memorable tracks, including the second Chanukah song, the funny satirical songs, and uncle donnie let out the crazy maniac in every listener...(ok maybe just me, just kidding!). Although this cd had some memorable stuff in it, and adam sandler as always put in the effort, he just came short this time round. Better luck next time, Adam."
1,? what happend ?,"This cd sounded good when i heard there was a Chaunka song II on it... then when i got it, it really sucked. I mean the cool guys are cool and and so is the Chaunakka song, but thats about it. I recomend getting one of his other cd's. This just isnt that good"
2,"Okay, but hes had better",This cd was nowhere near as funny as his other ones. I have all three other cd's and those are really funny. This has some good skits to it but they are very long. The 2nd Channukah song was a good addition but that was probably the best thing on it. Overall though it is decent but not as good as I expected it to be. If I were you I would wait till this goes down in price because it isnt really worth it.
4,Gary is the Best!,"Gary Daniels is the most superb movie martial artist of all time. In this movie he finally choreographs his own fight scenes and gets to play a character that is neither to prissy to fear or too enraged to be realistic. He plays Mike Ryan, a special forces guy with the skills to bring down a drug runner. The action in this movie was great considering that it's a martial arts flick. Though Gary Daniels has never let his fans down I need to complain about the director ant the poor lighting throughout the movie. The director seems to really aim for bad angles that miss a lot of the action and sometimes the fights are in front of the sun and all you can see are blurry silhouettes.I think that the bad parts can still be forgiven due to superior action and fighting scenes, and the use of consistent charicters."
3,Pretty fun; enough to make time go by faster,"Overall, this game is great for the money. However, like all games, they start to get monotonous when you have mastered them. It will keep you busy thinking for quite awhile and if you are always traveling, it will occupy the time."
5,Loved it!,"I am a 58 year old grandmother who has never figured out any of the other games my grandchildren have. I tried this and loved it! It is easy to learn and has a nice variety of games to keep you interested. Highly recommend for all ages. And, my 8 year old granddaughter loves it too."
4,TouchMaster,"This is a good game for the casual gamers like me . I'm 55 an just like to unwind with a game ( not get all jazzed up ) so this game is OK . I would like to be able to turn off the timer on the games, as I play and watch TV at the same time, but with this game you can't . Overall it's a good value ."
3,Good,"At first I couldnt put down this game. After it became monotonous. Same thing in different ways. Games are short and perhaps instead of having the option of so many games, designers should have spent more time designing more options for the game."
5,Very sad,Like all of the one last Wish books this one is very sad.This book opened my eyes to what real life is really like and how living can be if you let it a wonderful expercence. I also loved dont die my love by the author.
5,Classic Blondie CD,"I owned this album shortly after it came out in the 80's. I purchased it again recently and although many years passed in the interim, enjoyed it as much or more than I did when I orginally purchased the album many years ago.This is one of those CD's that although dated, still seem fresh and relevant. Lyrically, I feel it is one of Blondie's best works. The band matured by the point of this release and their musical content reflects that.Surprisingly, there are 4 ""Bonus Tracks"" included. Live versions of material played in various European concerts. This includes the odd choice of ""Ring of Fire"" from the soundtrack of the film ""Roadie"".I would not hesitate to recommend this album to anyone."
5,Joyful & Visionary,"Utterly compelling account of this most beautiful music. Grimaud plays with profound insight of the sort encountered in Gould's Bach or Malcuzynski's Chopin. The sonatas are a revelation, songful, unsentimentally lyrical and rhythmically perfect. The Op 109 Andante is a stunning illustration of the depth and beauty of the rendition, as indeed is everything on this disc. Perhaps Grimaud's impact will mostly be felt in Beethoven."
4,A Right to Die,It's a good book to read if your like mystery. Which is why I gave it a rating of four stars
5,Easy to Understand Golf Instruction,"Steve Anderson's new book ""On the Other Hand"" is a must read for all left handed golfers. Steve breaks down the full swing into three key fundamentals that are easy to understand. His discussion of the short game is concise and simple to follow. This is a great resource that golfers can refer to time after time in working on all areas of their game."
4,Lefties are neglected,There is a real scarcity of instructional golf books for lefties. I bought this book for my lefty wife and she loves it. The only thing that could be better would be a lefty golf book for women.
2,Was very disappointed,"I have loved Dave Eggar's other two CD's, and was looking forward to this one. However, instead of the fabulous piano music of the past, I was greeted with a cello. The music is not as relaxing as his prior efforts, and some of the melodies are downright angry. All in all, I was very disappointed."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,I bought these from last Friday's Sale and thought they were a really great deal at $12 a case - $1 a bag. I received them today and tore into a bag. They are SOOOO horrible I can't even make myself finish eating the bag. They honest-to-goodness taste like puke and make me want to puke eating them. I'm a cheese lover and LOVE cheese. I'm so disappointed. What a loss! The worst part is that they're a non-returnable item. I wish there'd been a comment before I purchased them :( I don't think I'll even be able to give them away. I'd give 0 stars if that was an option!
3,good and tasty chips,"These chips were good but I just wish there was more of the cheddar chesse kind because they're my favorite. They give you all them plain. The count of variety is not even. I should have read better, it might have said."
3,kronos,"Good moive,I remmber it will but when watching it, I forgot most of it. color would have been a nice touch. mabe steven spilbuarg will do a remake....talker."
3,"Kronos - the ravager of worlds,","A lonely traveler is out in the dessert (looks like the same place that many great sci-fi movies were made) in his 50's pickup when he spots a strange light. Meanwhile back at the laboratory an unusual meteor is being tracked on its way to earth. What do they have in common?The Dr. Leslie Gaskell (Jeff Morrow) suspects that there is some nefarious plot from outer space. They could be right. But can he prove it?This movie is missing the front-end dialog familiar with the classics of the era. They just used the word Kronos because they must have thought it sounded nifty like the giant, this of course is misleading as it makes you think it has something to do with time. There is a love interest between Gaskell (Jeff Morrow) and Vera Hunter (Barbara Lawrence). A fun side interest was looking at al the fancy scientific equipment circa 50's concept. The menacing device is hockey may have had too small of a budget."
5,Good Classic Sci-Fi,"Very original piece of sci-fi from the golden age. The creatures themselves are very different in the fact that they are pure energy. And the ""battery"", used to steal earths energy, is another something that is unique to the time this movie was made. If you like classic science fiction this one is a bit better than most."
2,"Cheeseball classic; not so good, and much less enjoyable as an adult!","I think most of the reviewers have hit the nail on the head with their reviews. I was very much looking forward to enjoying this movie as an adult; in my childhood, it was fascinating and I thought about it every now and then, anticipating the pleasure of a re-viewing.However, as an adult, I can only say that I'm glad I enjoyed the movie once, when I was young, naive, and easily impressed. This sad effort really has a dull, muddled plot, isn't very funny or thrilling, and the ""special"" effects are anything but! Even with very low expectations, this movie was a real waste of time; there are so many other ""classic"" sci-fi flicks which are much more deserving of the attention.If I were you, I'd take a ""pass""..."
1,Don't waste your money,This 2 CD set is basically composed of only 2 hugh PDFfiles that have no organization whatsoever and are a nightmareto try to navigate. There are some decent photos embeddedin the PDFs - but again there is no real organization of the dataor the photos.
5,Wow! What a great little documentary!,"I was actually impressed with the documentary I got for such a low price (less than $5 from the seller I went through). The video quality is decent and the documentary looks professional. There are loads of interviews featuring John Lennon, Cynthia, Yoko, Julian, and even Paul and George (no Ringo).Having the sort of interests I do, I was particularly impressed by Julian's mention of his grandfather's ghost protecting him during an auto accident and his father's promise to attempt to perform a particular action should he ever prematurally expire.There are two seeming ""experts"" on John Lennon and the Beatles with commentary throughout the documentary, and as other reviewers mentioned, you really have no idea who they are or from whence their ""authority"" comes, but so long as you are intelligent enough to recognize this it is not an issue.If you can grab ""John Lennon: Love Is All You Need"" for $5 or less do it! You will not be upset that you did."
1,Broken,"This humidor was a gift for my Brother-In-Law, and arrived with the glass shattered. I was very disappointed, and will not order from this company again."
2,Why does anyone ever buy Altec Lansing speakers?,"My speakers at work stopped working, and my boss purchased these as a replacement. He probably found them for about $15 at some hole in the wall. They're awful. If you take a pair of headphones, plug them into your computer's audio line out jack, place them next to your monitor, and turn the volume all way up, you'll have reproduced the effect of plugging these speakers in. There is no bass whatsoever. Altec Lansing has always been absolute trash as far as I have experienced, and anyone who says otherwise either has bad hearing, works for Altec Lansing, or both. Wouldn't it be hilarious if all the quality testers at Altec Lansing had bad hearing? It would certainly explain matters."
1,Awful product,"I understand why these are no longer available.I've owned these for 3 months after receiving them as a gift and the speaker with the controls already stopped working.They are VERY unstable and ANY amount of movement will knock one or both over. After a few days of them falling over, I got some double sided tape and taped them to my desk.The sound isn't anything special. The tone knob seems to be placed there for decoration only, as I didn't noticed any appreciable difference when it was turned from one side all the way to the other side all the way.The only almost positive thing I can say about them is that they are loud, although they distort quite a bit at higher volumes.If you want good speakers, look elsewhere. If you get them as a gift, the person giving them probably doesn't like you very much."
3,Speaker review,These speakers work fine. They don't come with a cord to connect your ipod to the speakers though. Just the stand in the picture. These speakers aren't recommended for counter-strike or any other fps game that really requires good sound to locate an enemy. They work well for music though.
4,Great magazine but much cheaper directly from their website,"You can get a one year subscription directly from the Pointe magazine website for 25% less. Of course you get the exact same product, so this review is just about the pricing."
5,Awesome movie of the series,I've always thought it would be wonderful to have a movie of these books. I really enjoyed it. There aren't many family movies these days and it's nice to have one like this.
4,My 2 year old loves it,"Since I am bilingual and am bringing up my daughter to be the same, I bought this book about 4 months ago. My daughter was 20 months old at the time and became fascinated with it. The illustrations are very colorful. Now that my daughter is 2 yrs old, she knows all the words in the book and we discuss what is happening, not only the objects in the book."
5,Watch out - the big one is coming,Great read. Howard Johnson is on to a great subject here. The characters are fun and the dialog is super. I read the nearly 500 pages in three days. Couldn't wait to get back to it each day. Could make a fine screenplay too.
5,British and Italian Frogmen,"This is the only film I have seen which features oxygen closed circuit rebreathers, similar to those actually used in WWII. The story is about the Italian 10th Light Flotilla and their attacks on British warships in Gibraltar's harbor and the British counter attacks. It tells the first part of the military history of Cdr. 'Buster' Crabb, GM, and his efforts to fight the then unique underwater operations. It deviates from the book of the same period (Commander Crabb), but it is a must see for sport and military divers interested in the history of diving.(The Tenth Light Flotilla, with only 6 frogmen, sank two British battleships in Alexandria Harbor. The British attacked and sank the German battleship Tirpitz in a somewhat similar fashion, but that is a different story.)"
5,This set blows away his San Francisco set,"While I found Sasha's San Francisco GU set to be an enjoyable and very polished romp through dance music of all genres, I think Sasha comes into his own here, truly distinguishing his style from the likes of anyone else. The first CD hooks you and the second pushes you over the edge, just as any great set should. Sasha knows how to move you, and the fact that most of these songs are unknown and better than a lot of more well-known songs shows that Sasha realizes that great sounds don't always have to come from popular artists.This is definitely my favorite set in the Global Underground series so far. Now how about a Paul Van Dyk 2-disc mix, Boxed?"
5,BRILLIANT,"Friday night at New York's finest Twilo. It is Halloween, and the deckmasters for the night are Sasha and Digweed. It is 6:30 in the morn ing, the crowd that left piggy-back space only throughout the night has almost dissipated. The only people left on the dancefloor are hardcore fans. Hundreds of them. Suddenly, the soul-touching synths of Bedrock's latest Heaven Scent, first low, in the background, progressing to full blast, raising hundreds of hands up in the ai r, bringing smiles and expressions of euphoria to tired faces of dedicated music lovers. Sasha is at the decks."
3,Great for every bride-to-be,"I bought this for myself at the recommendation of an email group of future and past brides. It helped me so much that I bought it as a gift for a friend. It is most especially helpful for those bride-to-be's who have been single and on their own for some time, and the changes they will go through as they go from single life to married life. It has some very good recommendations and points out many things about men and new husbands that you won't realize until you experience it for yourself. It also helps new brides to see things more from the man's perspective, and what's really happening with both of you as you try to adjust to such a big change in lifestyle. I would recommend it for anyone who's about to take the plunge. There's something in it for everyone and it covers a wide variety of topics."
4,Plexifairing Windshield,"I purchased this for my 07' honda CB 900 F (919 Hornet) and Its best described in:Pros:Easy to install and removeExcellant wind protectionConsHard to adjust so It wont rattle, but it can be done!I would have given it five stars if not for the rattle at low RPM.Update: FYI if you set the windshield above the headlight, (not touching the light) no rattle! Awasom shield."
2,All Hype,I love fishing and this book could not hold my attention for more than about 2 minutes.They spent more time in choosing the title and hype than authoring the book. Such is the modern world where adding to your revenue is more important than writing about a passion to share with the masses.
2,Fun to read for historic photos and some basic techniques.,"I was looking for instruction on making tuna rigs. This book tells some basic technique on most types of salt water fishing. But things like tying on a swivel, hook, and sinker are pretty basic. It has a lot of older photos and it was interesting because of these. There was nothing about modern lines like the super-strong braided lines we have today that require special knots. It was fun but I learned very little. For the price (used) it was worth it."
4,"Puts the ""Country"" back in ""Alt-Country""","This is a fine example of why the best country music is coming out of Austin. No big hats or phony Nashville vocals--just solid musicianship and strong song selection. The Dave Alvin production sounds like a Mavericks album with David Ball and the Beatles sitting in. Hard to summarize, particularly owing to the diverse vocals, but front-to-back as enjoyable a country collection as I've heard since the turn of the century."
2,"If you liked Straight Man and want more, DON'T read this.","In reading reviews for Straight Man by Richard Russo, I saw that Moo was mentioned as a similar book. The setting is similar, and it does feature university professors, but I could barely trudge through Moo. Despite flashes of adequacy, it seems like the sub-plots are very derived to make some sort of great tie-in at the end, which is even more boring than the sub-plots themselves. If you read Straight Man and wanted more, don't read this."
4,Therapeutic for office frustrations...,"I should note for the sake of a helpful review that I'm a bit biased in favor of this book, as I work on a higher-education campus. But Smiley so perfectly captures the sorts of personalities, frustrations, and deep-seated urge to gossip inherent to the workplace that I think anyone who's ever wondered who's running the place, or why they want to punch the vice president, would really appreciate the wink and nod variety of humor in this book. It is admittedly just a little longer than its arc, but it definitely has a beginning, middle and end. Give it a chance!"
4,Loved Earl,"I liked this book a fair amount, I kept picturing my undergrad alma mater (UW-Madison) while I read it. While the book bogged down a little towards the end, I liked reading it and thought the characters were all recognizable and realistic (especially in the academic world.)And I just liked Earl the pig. I got just way too upset when Earl was unhappy and wouldn't play with his toys."
2,"fun, and funny, but hardly literature",This book was basically a mildly amusing and fast-paced piece of fluff. I agree with the other reviewers who complained about the unresolved plotlines; it's a decent book but hardly worthy of Jane Smiley.
4,"Enjoyable overall, but tedious in spots","I enjoyed MOO, mostly because I attended Michigan State University as an undergraduate and saw many familiar ""slices of life"" in Smiley's tale about the fictional ""Moo University."" There are A LOT of characters, however, and I found some of the plot lines a lot more interesting than others. I sometimes had to push myself to get through the sections that I didn't find as interesting. Overall, though, a good read and I would recommend it, especially to those in a university setting. You'll definitely find some things to laugh at!"
1,What a waste of my time!,"This book was terrible. I liked it for about 5 minutes and then lost interest. There were too many characters, least interesting of all being the professors and administrators. Maybe if Smiley had written more about the 4 college roommates I would have given it TWO stars...but I doubt it. I couldn't get past the first 5 chapters and I finally gave up. And I had never been able to not finish a book I started before."
3,an incredibly observant book,"and very true to real life. But you had better take notes, the cast of characters is diverse and detailed."
1,Fun for English professors only,"Seriously boring. The whole thing felt like one of those ""you had to be there"" jokes. Only in this case, you had to be an English professor to enjoy this book.Even as a very recent college grad familiar with the academic environment, I still couldn't get into this book. None of the characters were interesting, nor were their storylines. Not recommended unless you're an English professor, in training to be one, or have a fascination with the tedium of academic life!"
1,non skid tape,I put this on the ramps on my shed so i wouldn't fall ...worst tape ever it fell off the ramps in a month.. if i had gone into the shed i would have fallen flat on my face..thanks worst tape ever......cheap must be dollars store tape.....
3,"Nice features, but soleplate drags","Nice medium priced steam iron with most wanted features including automatic shut-off, large water tank resevoir, vertical steaming, comfortable grip, spray and steam buttons, 360 degree pivot cord and non-stick soleplate. The cons being that the non-stick soleplate does not glide very smoothly and the water fill opening is very small. Irons jeans very well, but doesn't glide smoothly on cotton t-shirts."
1,Not as described,"""With the clear explanations presented in this text, even a novice will be able to practice the art of exposure assessment""Although the idea for the book is well conceived, the manner in which it is carried through is not. Mr. Daugherty has the bad habit of utilizing terms he has not defined, switching gears in the middle of discussions and other irritating habits.He also has a rather bad habit of pontificating, which is not required in a book of this type.Not nearly as useful as I would have liked."
4,marital comedy,"Dil Kabbadi is a marital comedy --> ""It is Kabbadi that one's heart plays"".theme of the movie is about couples in and out of love after being married .Great Actors . Good Watch"
1,disappointed,The recipes in this book were not tasty and rather complicated. I find myself going to my other 300 calorie recipe book more often. Fewer ingredients and better portion size.
1,Is this a same one?,"This dvd is MEDIA ASIA ""Jackie Chan MY STORY"".So this version is bootleg! If you want this dvd,you should better to buy MEDIA ASIA ""Jackie Chan MY STORY"". I waste my money. Nobody buy this dvd? And Picture is too bad, sound is latter than subtitles.Amazon com said "" region 1 "" ,but this dvd is "" all region""I thinnk. I am watching this dvd in Japan. So I think this one is like a bootleg."
3,Nautica,didn't realize this was aftershave and not the cologne when I purchased. Smells nice though.
4,good protector for the phone,This is a great product to protect your phone. the only thing I would like to see improved is that the skin would have a little more snug fit and if there could be a clear plastic cover for the face of the phone. Overall a great product.
4,The end of the Triology...,"I was read Swan Lake when I was the age of the little girl in the story, and waited for years for a sequel not knowing that there would be one. I loved the idea of a sequel, and I loved being able to live in the world that Mark Helprin created for little longer, but I thought that the social commentary he was making through the Tookisheims detracted from the main theme of the book and made it less timeless. I would never advise anyody not to buy it, I think that the whole trilogy should be part of everyone's library, but my first love will always be Swan Lake, although if I come across a deep blue jar at a garage sale someday, I will pick it up as tribute to the memory of these wonderful stories."
2,Skip this one altogether--A City in Winter is a better ending to the trilogy!,"Oh, it should have been stunningly beautiful and creative like the first two books. Instead, it was a truly depressing and 2nd rate end to the trilogy. While clearly others disagree, both my sister and I (we both love Swan Lake and A City in Winter) agree that it would have been better to have never read this ending. Trust me on this...there is no redeeming feature of this 3rd book that warrants you marring the beauty of the others. You'll be missing out on nothing but disappointment and lackluster gloom."
4,PHP at its best,This book takes PHP to the depth and reveals many of the methods and functions which can be only found out after years of extensive programming.The topics are very well organized. If you are looking forward to learn PHP grab this book.Although if you are looking for database sychronizations this book doesn't cover a lot.If you are looking for a PHP book other than Database applications this is the right one !!
1,Complete waste of money.,"I'm a intermediate-advanced PHP coder. I own 13 PHP books, some I use more than others. The only book of the 13 that has NEVER been useful for a single thing was this (sorry) ""cookbook."" Explanations are poor and the index is horrible. I wonder if the people giving this book high marks have really tried to use it. For real answers to how to do things give me Professional PHP or PHP and MYSL Web Development. Or if you're really stuck and need a clue, check out the DevShed.com forums. Cookbook? More like ""compost heap."" I think the authors just decided to take a bunch or random code they'd written and paste it all together into a ""book."" Gosh, maybe I should take some of my old stuff and publish it too."
1,Wrong Format,"I bought the DVD of ""Walking to the Waterline several months ago and have never been able to find a playback machine that can read the format. Apparently the format is not standard in the USA. I don't know why I didn't complain earlier. Mike Seely"
3,pretty bad,"This thing squeaks and rumbles along for what seems like hours, and then somebody will scream or start torturing a dog, and it scares the daylights out of you. I usually like Cage's prepared piano pieces, but this is mostly stupid noise."
2,Victor Bailey - mediocre song writing,"Victor Bailey can groove behind Madonna, Urban Knights, Zawinul, etc... but I am VERY glad Zawinul picked up Richard Bona to take his place in the Zawinul Syndicate. His song writing is much more 'bass-oriented' than it is 'musical.' His version of Continuum here is embarrassing to Jaco admirers, and his writing still leaves quite a lot to be desired."
4,A great rendition of a VERY sad book.,"I don't mind sad. If you do, skip Tess. Thomas Hardy is a great author who doesn't ""sugar coat"" his stories. This series is beautifully filmed. The cast is great. Loved it, but VERY sad story."
1,Left depressed,"Watch this series if you want to be left depressed. Rated 5 star, no way. Loved Tess and hated everyone else except Tess's milkmaid friends."
3,"Heartwrenchingly Sad, But Well Done","It was one of those stories that breaks your heart in the end, but watching it I found it to be well portrayed in acting, setting, and costumes. I must say you get caught up in each of the character's lives. You feel terribly sorry for Tess' life and struggle of survival, angry at her unforgiving husband who frankly I blamed just as much for the outcome of her life, and ready to spit at the man who manipulates her to destruction. If you can handle the outcome of the story, it's a good watch. But if you're looking for an uplifting story to leave you feeling great, move on elsewhere."
3,Didn't finish,"Acting was great. I know this is a classic but the story is so very depressing. Once I read a synopsis of the story online, I didn't finish it."
1,Hardy: Closet Russian Novelist,"This isn't a love story. It's a study in how religion screws with people and a public service warning against being born before the 20th century.The technical execution of the film version is well done, but the subject matter is relentlessly, cartoonishly, bleak."
4,Well acted British drama.,This was a pleasant watch. I think the times were even harsher on woman than were portrayed here. More entertaining.
1,Works on Mac now!,"They finally released a mac version that seems very nice from the little that I have used it so far.I had given it a bad review so now the software is so nice, I had to change my review to make it good.Too bad I can't change the star rating. I'd give it 4 or 5 if I could."
5,Nifty,"It is smaller than I expected. About the size of a cell phone. When mine came the impeller was stuck, but I gently rotated it and it now works fine. Instructions included, but I didn't even look at them."
3,Fun gadget but not much substance,"I bought two of these - one for me and one for a friend whom I had just completed a NWS Weather Spotting Course with. I tested the accuracy of the device by sticking it out the window while my wife was driving. She would read the speedometer and I would read the device. The device was always reading about 20-30% lower than the car's speed. A scientificly sound endeavor? Probably not but the device did not impress. During a recent high wind advisory, I climbed to the top of a hill and had similar results - NWS saying sustained winds were 25-35mph with gusts of 40mph+. The highest average I recorded was 16 and the highest gust was 31.Finally, the device is just a teenie little thing, about the size of a deck of cards. If you are looking for a novelty item, this would suit the bill. However, I think if you are looking for something reliably accurate, you may wish to pursue a different option."
3,Not Bad for the Price,"Well, it works as advertised once you take the battery cover off and correctly install the battery. BTW, the battery cover was very difficult to get off the first time, almost as if it were jammed or misthreaded.That was the only problem I have had with it. Wind speed indicator seems to be fairly accurate. You can really hear that tiny little impeller blade whirring up when the wind hits 20mph. I can't imagine it would hold together in 40 plus winds, even though it's rated up to 62mph.The temperature takes a long time to get to the correct reading and can be affected by body temperature if held in the hand.Basically, I thought it would be larger. I should have read the specs. Its barely over an inch and half wide, and maybe 4 inches long.Bottom line is, you get what you pay for. And on that point I am satisfied with it."
1,Had to return this unit,"When I received my La Crosse EA-3010U anemometer everything worked fine for a few minutes, then it stopped giving me wind readings. The temperature was showing on the display, but the wind was not. I had read other reviews mentioning their battery was dead, so I called La Crosse customer service and they told me to replace the battery. When I put a new battery in the unit, it worked fine for a few hrs, then it stopped registering wind speed. I put the original battery back in the unit and it worked fine for just a few minutes, then same problem. At this point I lost faith in the quality of this unit and felt it was better to get a Kestrel Anemometer as a replacement. While I did have the La Crosse unit a few days, I did notice that it takes a long time to get the correct temperature when taking it outdoors from the indoors. It seems that you get what you pay for when it comes to anemometers. I have not received my Kestrel anemometer yet so I have no comment on it."
4,Grandson delighted,I gave this anemometer to my 15 year old grandson for Christmas and he was absolutely delighted with it. He went right outside in the cold Minnesota winter to test it. Wind velocity is important to one who flies R-C planes.
3,This product doesn't fill my needs.,"Being on an extreme budget, I was looking for an anemometer that would be useful for hunting. I wanted one that could measure wind speeds less than one-mile-per-hour. All the other products that I had looked at, their wind vanes were way too small. When I saw this one, I thought that perhaps it could do the job, since it's vanes were much larger than the competition. But after receiving it, I unpacked it, and inserted a new battery. I then took it outside to try it. Much to my dismay, it only registered winds which were somewhere around 2 MPH. Anything slower than that, and it would not budge. I can only put in the category of being a toy."
5,Handheld Anemometer,"I fly large lifting kites and use this anemometer to measure wind conditions. It is portable, accurate, and reliable."
1,Item wasn't new.,"Very disappointed as item received with leaking lithium battery! My trust in Amazon, LLC, the seller, is greatly reduced."
1,anemometer DOES NOT measure wind speed,"Product looked good. It doesn't measure wind speed, the definition of an anemometer. I've emailed manufacturer, Amazon, seller...anyone I could think of. No response from anyone. I've changed the battery. The display lights and it reads temp. The fan rotates freely. It DOES NOT measure wind speed. Is the conclusion, don't buy anything technical from Amazon?"
5,Works,Replaced a faulty sensor on my 2009 G8 GXP and it works. Nothing more required from the part but it was a pain to install but can't blame the part for that.
4,Get some puppy peace,"These are great to distract/redirect chewing puppies but they like the ""rough"" type one way better than the smoothe one"
3,Where are the opening titles?,I love Survivor and I'm really glad Amazon is putting these out on dvd. My only complaint on this one is where are the opening titles on the episodes? So far this is the only season they have put on dvd missing the openings and I hope it's the only one they do this way! I'm hoping it's an over sight on their part and would be nice if they corrected it and offered an exchange like happens on several dvd's where there is a mistake made and something left out or has a glitch.
5,Select this edition,"The Amazon reviews were extremely helpful in selecting this particular editon of Go Dog Go. I wanted the same edition my children (as toddlers) had enjoyed, and without the reviews I may have received an abbreviated, later version."
3,Go Dog Go,This book is a book for younger children who are just learning to read. It is a good book to learn with because it has very easy words to read but it is long so the child can feel that they did a very good job reading a good book. This book is about dogs and how they drive cars and hang out and swim and fish and things like that. This book has very good pictures in it. This book tells where the dogs in the book are and what they're doing. It also says what color the things are that they're wearing and the colors of the things there in or by. It is a good book to learn to read because it has very good action words and descriptive words. It has colors and cars and objects and things like that.I would rate this book a 3. It is good for very young children to read but it doesn't really have a point to it. I enjoyed it but I just don't think that the book is good for older children. I would suggest this book for people who are just learning to read or for people who like Dr. Suess books.
5,go dog go,"i enjoyed this book as a child, soi got it for my grandson[17 months old]. I hope he will be happy with it as well."
5,Years of Doggie Fun,"Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyThis is a short, terrific book that neither you nor your child will tire of reading. Toddlers love the idea of dogs driving cars, and beginning readers enjoy the satisfaction of reading the story without help. This makes the book appropriate for a wide age range. The ending is charming and will put a smile on your face as well as your child's."
4,A Very Nice Book for Toddlers and Beginning Readers,"Go Dog Go is an easy reader portraying many kinds of dogs engaged in various activities. It introduces opposites and adjectives, as well as many human activities such as riding carnival rides, following traffic rules, sleeping, waking, working, and playing. These are all presented in brief scenes, with two main interwoven plots -- dogs driving to a dog party, and a male and female dog who become friends by the end of the story. The brief scenes make the book a good fit for toddlers with short attention spans, and beginning readers, for whom the task of reading can be arduous.The words are simple, but Eastman creates funny and imaginative scenarios through repetition and appealing drawings. The book was published before sophisticated printing techniques were available, and its charm is enhanced by its simplicity. It does, however, get old for adults around the tenth read-aloud."
4,This Book Is Very Memorable,"As I read this book, I remembered back to when I was a child. The very first time I read this book I was filled with anxiety. I always told my mom to get to the end because I really wanted to see what the dogs were up to. This book has a various amount of imagination inside of it. I recomend that parents should read this book to their children.Parker"
4,Ghost Writing,"An interesting study of how being a ghost writer can lead to identity issues. The author at first had a welcome helping hand, but eventually found it difficult to extricate from the influence of the person she was ""ghosting"". Also, a case study of dependency and co-dependency."
3,Inspiring,Animals are not easy for humans to comprehend but Gary Kowalski takes us several steps toward that goal. His book is an easy and compelling reading. A book needed by today's world where habitat destruction has brought us into closer contact with animals. It's a small book which makes it quick to read but it provides an insight into their world.
4,A few issues with editing...,"I was pleased to be able to purchase this book quickly and, relatively, inexpensive.I purchased it primarily for the Handel-Casadesus Concerto. The other editions are usually more.This one has other pieces in it and, hopefully, there is an available cd for it. I have not checked this yet.The editing is sometimes a problem but I fix it to suit myself. Otherwise, it is a good deal."
5,Perfect.,"Beautiful in every way. Outstanding and much appreciated photos. Wonderful commentary. Authentic recipes.The author should be very proud of this fine accomplishment and this book should be in every public library. In fact, I may send a copy to a politician to remind him that we all immigrated here from someone else- except the Native Americans. They should be the only ones who have the right to decide our immigration policy."
4,"Good speaker, great price","I have had this speaker pair for about 6 months now. I was able to purchase the Polk Monitor 40 for right at 100 dollars per pair, so great price!While not real wood, the black speakers have a decent look. It doesn't look high end, but doesn't look ""plastic satellite"" cheap either.The 2 5+ inch drivers do a good job of giving range and volume for music and while I have heard it described as bright by some, I feel it has a nice balance of base and high freq sound. I find them to be very good for music. Maybe because of my set up and less than perfect room, these speakers do not seem as good in the home theater area. I also don't have a sub in that set up, so...Overall, a very good speaker for the money and perfect for a bedroom setup!"
1,PAID FULL RECEIVED HALF!!!,"The -item- i received was 'used' but in good condition as stated; however the title clearly says ""Volume One And Two"" it would be nice if 'Volume Two' would ever make it into the mail. Next time, please ask for HALF as much money and maybe, i won't feel cheated. p-"
3,Logevity,"I just threw this rack away. It served its purpose for about 4 years but won't last longer than that. Issues; the XTC may be better but I won't buy a Swagman again. The center pole on the XC is not high enough for many bikes and mine fell off and was lost twice. By diving intervention, I got it back both times. Swagman made me buy the taller pole from the XTC even though this was obviously a design flaw in the XC. The bolts in the rack where you screw the rack to your 1 1/4 hitch are held in place by plastic, which breaks and then it doesn't work so well. The body of the rack starts to rust and sooner than you want, you get to where I was today- throwing it away because its life is over.I will pay more for a better rack this time- which hopefully will cost less because it lasts longer."
4,Swagman,Excellent design. well constructed. bike held firm on the back of our truck. easy to load/unload. folds flat for easy access to the truckbed. dont like the lock pin but I can live with it. its a screw in type and not generic.
5,Well Built and Stable.,"I have used this rack a few times now the last being a 4 hour round trip which it held up perfectly. The Swagman rack is well made, very stable and I trust it without hesitation. The rack was attached to the swagman receiver mount for square camper bumpers which also worked great. If I had to complain about something it would be the pin that holds it in is actully a bolt that screws in so a locking pin is unable to be used. The bolt does draw the rack to the hitch to prevent it from rattling around. BOTTOM LINE: Well build, stable, worth the money paid, would and have recommended it to others."
5,WHAT A RELIEF,"I bought one just like the one advertised here in January. I had paid almost four hundred for a Tuhle that I thought was a piece of crap. Traveling any distance and the bikes would rub and move. I could not get them strapped down enough to stop this. I bought the Swagman and it only took a few minutes to put together and takes only seconds to load the bikes, lock them down and go. I couldn't believe how much easier it is. I love having it and especially after fighting with the Tuhle for two years. Thank you Swagman!"
5,Awesome Rack,"sturdy, holds bikes on with out straps or damaging the frame. Able to lock the rack to the truck and the bikes onto the rack. Great product for the price."
2,Bike Rack hitch mount,"Received in a timely manner. Assembled easily. There were a few paint chips on the tire supports. When I went to side it into the 1 1/4 inch receiver it would not fit! I doubled checked the assembly which was correct. I called Swagman, and was advised that there had been similar complaints. Appears they over sprayed the power or paint on the bike rack, causing it not to side into the receiver. Swaggman told me to ""file off"" the power or the paint and it would then fit. I didn't want to do that because first, its a new bike rack and second it would promote rust. I asked them to send me a new part , one that would fit into the receiver. They said they would...still waiting for the part to come."
3,Swagman bike rack,"This bike rack is ok, but it is a dual fitting ( fits 1 1/4 and 2 "") not just a 2"". The piece between the rack and the hitch is 1 1/4"" and is not straight. This is not as good as the straight 2"" piece. Amazon should advise it fit either hitch not just 2"""
5,Great bike hitch,"This hitch does everything right. It sets up easy. It holds the bikes firmly. It's light enough to mount on the car with no hassles. It folds down to an easily storable size. Most importantly, it takes about three seconds to mount a bike on it. One word of advice is to make sure to use the included threaded pin to connect it to your tow hitch. That makes everything nice and solid.Highly recommended."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this rack because the information on line indicated it was easy to install and use and would take 2 bikes even with a spare tire mounted on the back of your vehicle.It was not easy to install..all of the paint had to be ground off the area where the rack fitted into the hitch. The paint would not allow the rack to fit into the hitch.The rack does not hold 2 bikes with a tire on the back of the vehicle. There was a photo on-line showing a vehicle with two bikes, but it does not work with mine. (Honda CR-V)Having said all of the above, I am using it for one bike and it works well."
4,"Great rack, but difficult to secure from theft.","Functionally, this rack is very effective. Initially, I had to spend about thirty minutes affixing the bike and wheel wells into place. But now, it takes two minutes to lock and load. The only drawback is securing the bikes from theft. I like to go to restaurants or shops before or after a bike ride. But the rack does not come with and is not fitted to receive locking devices to secure the bikes to the car hitch, or rack. I had to get a long, wire lock to lock the bikes to the hitch receiver and then use the same lock to secure the rack to the hitch receiver when I'm off biking. Functionally, great for the price. But security could be a little lacking."
4,Easy to set up and install,I reviewed a number of options and finally settled on the Swagman XC Cross Country.The comments of other users helped with the decision as did the information about the threaded lock pin that you can use with this device. (Note: do not buy the one that is not threaded as it is not compatible with this model.)It was very easy to assemble and install on my vehicle and the bikes (large men's and medium woman's mountain bikes) fit perfectly.The Amazon price is the lowest I found for the same model and it was shipped quickly and arrived safely. The video that shows how to assemble it was very helpful also........would recommend this rack to anyone who wants a solid product and a reasonable price.
1,Wrong combo,the package deal that includes the Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (2-Inch Receiver)and locking hitch pin does not work. The locking hitch pin does not fit the Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (2-Inch Receiver)Wrong locking pin for the Hitch even though its is sold as a package.
5,Soooo Easy to use!!,"This was so easy to set up and use, I can't believe I waited so long to get this rack! I have a 2 inch receiver and thought it might be sticking out too far, but it turned out to be steady even with two bikes. The one thing I think should be pointed out is Amazon pushes selling you a Master Lock which does fit the normal 2 inch receiver, BUT it will NOT fit through the smaller hole that is on the bike rack unless you drill out the holes to a larger size. I would not recommend that as it would seem like there would NOT be enough metal left to feel secure for the long run. Hope this helps!"
5,Great!!!,"The SURVIVAL! books shine. The story is so vivid you can experience what the characters are experiencing and you can feel the unearthly fear of succumbing to the violent forces of nature. Book #5 is really good! Adventure buffs, check it out. I'll warn you, though--the father's an idiot!"
1,Ellington arranged for the elevator,"I first heard Ellington's orchestra in 1957, (a Johhy Hodges Sax solo)and I have loved his music and arrangements ever since. This is not for real fans of his orchestra. The tunes are there, but they are full of piano solos focusing on the entire melody rather than supplementing the soloists as Ellington did. The music came out bland and colorless.As I listened, I could only think: MUZAK."
3,"Its ok for the price, but do not expect miracles","Needed another natural bristle brush for finishing cabinets while my other brush dried, so I bought this since it was branded from the same company as the finish I was using. Figured I'd risk it, but I guess you do get what you pay for. The purdy brush I got from home depot cost more like 10 dollars but it shed less bristles and the bristles remained straighter and more even. The miniwax brush gets the job done but it is more trouble to clean as it shed quite a bit more bristles than the nicer brush, and after it dried it had strays to deal with."
5,best toothpaste ever,"I got hooked on Ajona toothpaste when I was in Germany in the '90s and brought back several tubes. The tube is small, but you only need a tiny drop on your brush so it lasts a long time. It has a wonderful, refreshing clove taste. I primarily use it for travel."
3,Great except for flimsy hanging hardware,"I'm very pleased with the look of the sienna roman shade, and of course the insulation is a must for keeping drafts out. Installation was a snap, but the metal brackets that hold the whole shade up are flimsy and poorly made, so one side does not hold on properly and the bracket shows above the shade. Also, the metal brackets attached to the wall hold a metal channel attached to the shade, so when you pull the cords to the side to release the cord lock, the whole shade has a tendency to slide and threaten to fall down. This is a great product; it just needs to include some real hardware."
1,It's bouncy,"If you put something in this pouch that has any sort of weight, it becomes a bouncy nuisance."
1,This is NOT Ray Conniff,"This album has absolutely nothing to do with Ray Conniff. He did, however, record all the songs listed, but here they are performed by some unknown orchestra (in a very poor way that does not pay a tribute to Conniff). Titles 10 and 11 are ONE track only, Love Is A Many-Splendored Thing"". As the president of the Ray Conniff International Fan Club, all I can say is: Buy original Ray Conniff albums, not this one!"
2,Stand is excellent - Amazon listing and picture deceiving,"We purchased this item assuming it came with both a practice pad and the stand. The Amazon listing shows a practice pad in the product photo and lists the item as ""Remo Stand, Practice Pad, Tall"" That pretty much tells me its a stand AND a pad. Not so. We are disappointed with the listing on Amazon. But the stand is nice, sturdy and what we wanted in a drum pad stand.We will now order the Pad as an addition to the stand. This will cost more than another listing we saw on another site that sold both together. So we are spending more than we would have needed to.Future buyers be warned."
3,OK BOOK,"There were 2 things I really didn't like about the book. 1st the title really gave away some of the parts of the book. 2nd the ending was really confusing and I didn't understand it at all. Over all, this book is a so-so book."
1,"Fun, but False","Enjoy this book, and the movie, if you like, but please, please, please, don/t think for a minute that it's ""Almost true."" The true story of His Majesty Rama IV is much, much more fascinating."
5,Bike mirror,"This is the best bicycle mirror that I had, have and would have. Why? Well... its large, see the whole road behind you and in the front you have these two bright orange-yellow reflectors. And let me tell you: the cars see you! When I broke my mirror I could not find anywhere THIS mirror (and I checked 3 bike-shops) when I checked here on the site. And... well, it had the best price and I bought two because of that. Delivery was good and fast, received them in a good time and I installed one of them right away. I am a very pleased customer. :-)"
4,Trav-LBar PMB@-B Vinyl 2- Bottle Black,This is a basic hard backed travel Bar. It is very sturdy and looks nice.
1,The Disc that will Undo HD DVD,"I am SO ANGRY with this release. Not ONE of the HD sides of these movies play in my 360 Add On - all the SD sides play fine ....great. I have both Blu Ray and HD DVD , and from now on I am abandoning HD DVD as a format - Blu Ray deserves to win the war, and I am so sorry to say that as I am NOT a Sony fan boy. SHAME on every company associated with this buggy, defective rubbish release of what should have been HD DVD's finest moment so far. Consider the HD war over - mark my words, in 2 years no one will remember the ""HD DVD"" format."
5,Im Not sure wether its a 2 thombs up or 2 thombs down,well i consider myself one of the biggest Matrix fans on the globe ... but if Package didn't include DTS & THX & all the Extras movie enthusiasts look for in Boxed sets .. then it's not worth buying ... i have all the 3 movies + the Animatrix on DVD ... so the producers simply have 2 impress me enough 2 buy this although i have them alll .....& i really do wanna buy it if it has DTS & THX ... i'll keep my fingers crossed ( maybe some of them r reading ) .. have a nice day all
4,A decade later......,"Over 10 years later this trilogy (plus animated feature) is still pretty amazing. Aside from the silliness about this being some allegory to something or other it is fun to watch. They are very visually appealing and the stories interconnect. Could this series have been better? Of course it could have, there are very, very few movies that are simply great."
5,The ultimate Matrix collection!,"This is the ultimate Matrix collection! Very good and complete, this must be your choice for your Matrix collection."
4,It works,The Matix on blue ray isn't much to talk about. The quality is on par with DVD. They didn't even bother to change the label. But this film did come out before home theaters really became mainstream. The second two you can really tell the difference in sound and video. If your a fan this is a must have set
4,Simply Stunning!,"The picture quality on all the movies in this box is simply amazing. There is a certain amount of grain in all of them but, I think, this is just normal film grain.The cover box is a bit flimsy and not glued on properly although this could just be a 1 off thing.All in all this box set is really worth the price."
4,Excellent collection!,"I have to say, that I'm a little biased when it comes to Sci-Fi movies. I LOVE them! Although most would agree that the sequels aren't all that great, I really enjoyed them. The ultimate edition goes beyond the movies by providing a ton of extra content and that sets this collection apart from the individual movies. If you like featurettes and ""the making of"" content, this is a must have!"
1,Another Buggy Combo HD DVD Set,"I'd love to know what these disks look like in HD DVD, except my Toshiba HD-XA2 player won't recognize them as HD DVDs! First there were the problems with ""The Good Shepherd"", ""Children of Men"", and ""Smokin' Aces"" Universal DVD/HD DVD Combo Disks. Toshiba blamed it on faulty disks, but oddly enough they released Firmware version 1.6 to fix the ""not correct DVD format"" problem.Now I'm getting the same errors with my Ultimate Matrix disks! Sounds to me like it's not a disk issue, but a Toshiba HD DVD player issue. In other words, if you own any HD DVD player other than the MS Xbox 360 HD DVD player -- Toshiba makes every other player -- keep in mind the adage ""CAVEAT EMPTOR"".IMHO, either wait for Toshiba to address future firmware issues in a timely manner, or wait for these titles to be released on Blu-ray."
4,Packaged like pirated stuff,"Blue quality/ hd audio is as per expectation, but the box, the covers are pretty pedestrian. I was expecting better."
3,Sick,"As an early adopter of media platforms for years. I feel as a customer you get the highest value at the dawn of a new format. This along with Warner's own, 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and Universal's 'The Deer Hunter' are examples. I along with most, do not care for the second two films, but if i look at it like some long animatrix episodes them i guess 'The Matrix' sure costs alot! Look if you got the hardware to run these double-sided discs!!! (sick) run it! Were talkin 30GB on each side, 60 gigabyte discs! (take that bluray lol) x 5, this should be called 300! [Note to Buyers] *Buyers Beware* Animarix is in SD if anyone cares to begin a petition, i am at arms..."
4,Juan Carlos mejia from Panamà,"I received 10 disc, including the 3 movies, the animatrix cd and all the revisited`s, but i`ll prefer to have a book to storage the whole pack, instead of this big acrylic case, that i can`t store with my movies collection; and for the Neo figurine, i don`t know, ask my dog who`s chewing it right now."
2,Not at all happy!,"I tried playing the discs, but none of them would work properly and that too the first time after i got it! It's brand new."
1,a total ripoff,"The Matrix is excellent. The Animatrix is excellent. Reloaded and Revolution were awful. This has to be the biggest rip off going right now. The two sequels are basically awful movies and should never be watched by anyone. This is hollywood dribble at its worst. The only bigger ripoff is the Ultimate Limted collection which is well over 100 dollars. They also went back and ""remastered"" the Matrix to make it look like the other two. No reason for this. Now it looks all washed out and grey like the last two. I seriously almost walked out of the theater near the end of Reloaded I was so dissapointed.The Matrix will stand the test of time. Reloaded and Revolutions are easily forgettable. Even die hard Matrix fans thought these two films were awful. Revolutions is so full of itself I almost felt like I was sitting through Sunday school or something. Buy the LOTR trilogy instead."
5,Great,Always great!! and arrived fast! Love having the Matrix in my Movie library as I am now buying all bluray
1,QUE PASA CON LA GENTE LATINA????,"ESTE DVD CONTIENE TODO EL MATERIAL ADICIONAL QUE UNO DESEA PERO LAMENTABLEMENTE LAS PRODUCTORAS SE OLVIDAN O A MI PARECER SIMPLEMENTE NO LES INTERESA EL PUBLICO LATINO Y POR LO TANTO NO HAY SUBTITULOS EN CASTELLANO MAS QUE SIMPLEMENTE EN LAS PELICULAS Y ASI NO ES, NO ME PARECE JUSTO YA QUE NOSOTROS TAMBIEN SOMOS UN GRAN PUBLICO QUE CONSUME ESTOS PRODUCTOS Y POR CONSIGUIENTE NO APOYAMOS A LA PIRATERIA."
1,Terrible,"Negative - 5 stars!...do not order, you will get the first two matrix movies only twice....so both cd's are identical....ordered this twice, they got it wrong the second time too!!!! GRRRRR!!!!"
3,Pat73,This is a very uneven series of movies. I like Reeves a lot but the 2nd and 3rd films are too hard to follow and seem almost stupid in their excesses. Pat 73
5,Blu-ray version worth it,"I got the Amazon special one-day deal, just $25 for the Ultimate Collection on Blu-Ray, so it was a no-brainer to upgrade from my old stadard DVD version. Yes, it looks great on Blu-Ray, but it isn't so spectacular that I'm going to rush out and replace all 500 of my standard DVD movies with Blu-ray versions. Most standard DVDs upgrade very nicely on the Blu-Ray player, but some films really pop in HD, and The Matrix Collection is a good example. Avatar also looks great in HD, if you haven't gone all the way to 3D with your TV yet. The Matrix films bear watching over and over because you see or understand something new every time. The visuals and content are so deeply rich that you can't possibly appreciate it all in one or two viewings. The special features here also offer hours of in-depth enjoyment."
4,The Ultimate Matrix Collection,Part three was the only real disappointment in the series; not a terrible film just didn't meet the standards of the first two.
1,Will This Set Reveal Theft of THE INVISIBLES?,"I have but one single question to ask about this collection . . .Will it be revealed anywhere that the Wachowski brothers, who are admitted VERTIGO COMICS fans, actually plagiarized VERTIGO COMICS series THE INVISIBLES, by Grant Morrison?If you want to read about THE REAL MATRIX, then you must check out THE INVISIBLES! It is a MUCH BETTER STORY and it does NOT get progressively horrible the closer one gets to the end of the story, as does The Matrix.Finally, if you don't know who Grant Morrison is or who THE INVISIBLES are, then please do yourself a favor and check it out!The Ultimate Matrix Collection = 1 starThe Invisibles Graphic Novel Series = 100 stars (out of five!)"
3,Inside a Lacie box,"Worked reliably for approx. 18 mos. then click-blink-clink-blink nothin. I expected a lot more life for the price I paid for it at the time (This unit came inside a Lacie FireWire box).I run a hotrod Mac G4, Big Audio files (Audio Restoration Work) . I Used it for Audio burns ONLY (of course). As for now, I must use my 2 yr old internal Pioneer AO7 DVD for audio; atleast till a replacement is delivered or locally purchased.For the price, I will give Lite-On another try. Although I'm not Impressed thus far... I'ld give LACIE a 2star, because they should install only the HIGHEST quality in their boxes. Lacie patronizes High End Mac users at premium prices."
1,"Beware of seller ""Bergtkeller""","How interesting that ""bergtkeller"" reviews himself below praising the good service that he got from himself when he bought one from himself (somehow though it took him 3 days to deliver it to himself).Well, you've got me sold bergtkeller. How can I resist a seller that has zero sale reviews, and isn't even smart enough to use a different screen name to promote himself. I'll take 3, and I'll send payment today, really. You can trust me; I do."
1,Terrible Writing,"Here is the whole plot:Government puts bad people into cryosleep in space.Government also puts good guys who disagree with them in that prison.There is a prison break and the bad guys control the space station with the presidents daughter and 'good' convict on board.From there you can guess what happens. All of the characters are bland and the plot 'twists' are just as predictable. I watched it from Redbox for $1 but that was a ripoff.If you have children though who like guns and gore, this is for them. Becuase the writing is on par with dora the explorer."
3,formulaic,"kind of dull really. acting wasn't that great. special effects were ok. plot was kinda unbeleivable, now that isn't necessarily bad but this was over the edge with frozen prisoners in space"
2,Pass,"The same story told over and over again. The acting was bad and you know what is going to be next. This is a pass, wait till it comes out on tv."
3,It's ok,"I thought this would be a better movie then it actually was. I'm glad I got it on sale, otherwise I would have waited for my cable co. To run it"
1,Don't waste your money...,"Good prison scenes--the rest--pretty poor writing and acting (dialogue will literally aggravate you, terrible), crap CGI. If you are looking for an action movie, it will let you down."
3,Ok...not great,"It was an ok movie, not a huge story line, in fact, kind of flat. It filled a time slot."
3,Standard Space Adventure with Corny Dialogue,"I am always a fan of sci-fi, thus streamed this film for cheap. It was made by a Euro-director (Luc Besson) who has done films like Precinct 13? and other wild urban action films. This time he goes to space and Guy Pearce is the space cowboy. His lines are worn and his character is goofy, to say the least. The action moves okay and the special effects are decent, but it does not add up in the long run. Thta old one with Sean Connery up in space prison had more tension and reality. Blastoff!"
2,No characters,Excellent production values but no characters and plot holes bigger than black holes.Now Amazon is insisting I write at least 20 words. That's BS. My entire review was one line and that's all this movie warranted.Amazon--don't tell your customers how to write a review!
1,Luc Besson receives one star for being better than the movie,"This is one of the worst sf movies in history. Repugnant violence, because the director wants you to be thrilled so the violence is not justified. No way. And the villain doesn't get punished before the ending. And the ending is lame, because you were waiting for something else. An the acting is juvenile and amateurish. And so is the director. And there is noise in space, because the producers missed physics 101 in school."
2,Should Have Known Better But Hoped...,"Really wanted this to be a nice, action, set-in-space,flick BUT what I got was a poor version of ""Escape from NY"". Do not recommend."
1,Dismal,This movie is very bad. Not worth the time let alone the money to rent it. If you are looking for a good science fiction action movie look elsewhere.
4,Decent action movie,"Was not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised with acting from Guy Pearce. production value is cheaper, especially the beginning, but overall a decent action flick."
2,Wow. Just WOW!,That was one of the worst sci-fi flicks I have seen in... forever. And I am including things like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012.
2,Don't reward Hollywood for this middling effort.,"With a little effort on plausibility, this could have been ok. Overall, a bit stupid. Guy P. bought the film an extra star."
3,ok sci-fi thriller,"most of the actors Ive never heard of before, dialog and plot were confusing, special effects were great, the conclusion showed the twist ending"
2,Not a good product.,I can only say this is a very cheap product. The settings are futurist settings and the acting performances are OK. But overall this is a quite cheap product in both story and produce budget.
3,lockout,Movie was interesting. Not really what I expected from traiers but good never the less. Action became intense and predictable.
4,Good Movie,Enjoyed the movie and felt it was very good. Enjoyed the movie and would recomend to freinds. Happy I did not go to the theater to see it would have been enoyed spending the money. But still liked movie and like owning it. Would suggest to freinds.
3,Pretty fun!,"It's about an inch deep, but it doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is. It's a fun science fiction/action flick?"
4,Gives some good updated information about hacking,"Good overall reference book, little disappointed in the life history of the hackers. The definitions and timeline will be very helpful. The book gives some very good updated information about where to locate detailed information on the web. For the price I would recommend this book to others."
4,Be very afraid...,"I became so nervous while reading this book. After a shooting at a neighboring school, Pleasant Valley High, the students at Central High are feeling the effects. Every day a new rule is put into effect...metal detectors, no cell phones, checking backpacks, and then reporting on your classmates. The principal takes a back seat to the counsellor. Grief counsellor runs a daily morning assembly. And then students begin to disappear... then a teacher who failed to report a student with a cell phone...and then even the principal! I kept hoping that the grief counsellor would have his demise. Yet his hold on the community kept getting stronger through his daily e-mails.This is a scary book that demonstrates what happens when we challenge a young person's right to free speech and expression.I could only shudder at the end...being a middle school teacher."
3,"Some good ideas, could have used a better editor","I remember liking this book when I read it years ago, and intend to read it again soon, in which case I may revise and expand my comments here.One thing I recall about the book, though, was that some of the stories in it are repeated: not for emphasis, but in apparent disregard for their having already been used. Like another reviewer, I was also frustrated by the lack of an index. I typed up my own list of the 101 Ways, and discovered there's actually 102 since there are two different Rule 90s! D'oh! There's some dumbth right there."
3,Disappointing,"From Steve Allen I expected better. This comes off as though his publisher was pushing him to complete the 101 points in a certain time frame. Items are covered, but not well, and not reflective of Steve's wit and style. Still, there are some good pointers. The first part of the book, the narrative, is the best part. He shares some frighteningly stupid things that people have said and done. You'll find yourself either gasping, or nodding your head in agreement."
4,Good movie,"Direction by Dayal Nihalini is good in parts but bad in parts Music is good, especially the title songAmongst actors Govinda is as usual in comic scenes but excels in serious scenes, especially when he comes to know he has tumour and the entire scenes later and also his outburst with Aditya proves he can deliver much more Aditya too is very good in his part Shilpa Shetty is typical and irritates at times Raj Babbar is nothing great Gulshan Grover overacts, Mohan Joshi is unbearably loud the rest are adequateGovinda has done several serious roles even when he did comedy post AANKHEN this is one of those films where he gets to prove himself as an actor"
2,A Complex Man,"MacArthur appears to me to be one of the most complex men in our history. He was without a doubt brilliant and farsighted. He was also a man with an oversized ego. He at times was liberal minded, especially in his handling of the defeated Japanese. At the same time he wants to be president of the United States and in that regard expressed very conservative views. He was a mama's boy and yet rose thru the miliitary ranks in a remarkably short period of time. When i finished the book my most vivid thought was this man a great leader? a good or bad man? It is a great book in the fact that both sides of this complicated man is protrayed. It is a great book."
1,"oh, the angst burns so","This novel seems to me to be a theraputic exercise for the author, but therapy and good storytelling don't always come together. This book is in spots witty and clever, though it sorely lacks emotional maturity. The players are two-dimensional caricatures, too often confused by the author with real characters. Mr. Cadre shows a persistent loathing of all his literary creations, without the singular ounce of caring that would make the reader engage them. We don't care about the cartoon people, but we are frequently asked to take them so seriously as to spoil the campy fun possible here.The especially brilliant bits of humor would be better served in a fully-developed story. Sadly, the sense that this is a smart kid's whining session made Ready, Okay unbearable."
3,"Good suggestions, a little on the religious side","I purchased a couple copies of this book as a gift for two friends who recently lost their dogs. Unfortunately, I decided to return them, as I felt the book while it had a lot of good suggestions for the bereaved, it had too much of a religious 'tone' for my taste."
3,Microsoft MVP 2005 - Visual C# recommends caution,"Hands-On Microsoft Access is one of the better Access books ""if"" you are developing entire applications in Microsoft Access. This includes using Access forms as well as reports.The author does a nice job of explaining how to write fairly elaborate Access applications. Tons of screen shots and real world terminology is a plus for beginners.However, if you are writing applications in a typical programming language such as Visual Basic 6.0 or any one of the .NET languages, you'll want to pass on this one.The book won't cover any of the SQL quirks Microsoft Access has and the less than easy to find workarounds."
3,where the west began.,Oh. the thrill of it all! That's what W.S. Hart said in an interview long ago; this film takes you WAAAYYY back to when it all began.
3,WEAR THICK SOCKS!,"Since there are no half sizes and the recommendation is to buy the next size up, the shoe can be a little loose and rub on the heel/achilles tendon area if you don't have thick socks. Wear socks that are higher than the back of the shoe. I normally wear a 9M and I think 8.5 M would be perfect...but no such luck!!!"
5,better than I expected,"I received this watch two days sooner than promised and fell in love with it immediately. I have owned Skagen watches before and never have had a problem with them. They keep excellent time, are sturdy, light and beautiful, but this is the lightest, thinnest one I have worn and is just lovely. The bracelet gleams, the gold tone on the face and little setting cap gives it a touch of class and goes with gold and silver jewelry.It took me a while to jiggle the adjustment bar to shorten the band, but my eyesight isn't the greatest. Now it fits perfectly and has spoiled me from switching watches for different outfits. I just don't want to take it off. Amazon's sale at $57 is an unbelievable bargain. And it came directly from Skagen with a lifetime guarantee."
4,Watch for Wife,This is a lovely ladies watch. Perfect size with good styling. Very secure clasp. Value for money. I would recommend Skagen for sure!
1,Nice looking bracelet,My wife bought this watch because she liked the looks. It worked for a year and a half. I bought a replacement for her since the repair for the original would have cost more than the watch was worth. The replacement lasted six weeks. Replaced the battery to no avail. This is clearly a bad watch with a high failure rate.
1,So unhappy with this terrible scanner,"The Powerslide 3650 is a flimsy unit that jams on every batch, eats slides when jammed, misguides 50% of the scans it attempts (meaning only half the image appears in the entire frame of the photo because the slide didn't go all the way in), has no idea what frame its on, so has no problem scanning the last frame 50 times before you stop it, and on and on.The software that comes with it is a joke.My unit did not work under USB (windows XP reported a malfunctioning unit), but it did work with firewire.I wouldn't mind that it was slow as it was, if it was one of those set-it-and-forget-it sorts of things, but it's literally requiring my attention several times every hour. And I've only got through three batches (only 50% came out because of this strange loading problem it has).Scanning quality seems to be ok, no problems there.I do not recommend this to anyone."
3,Good for what it is.,"It does a fine job of scanning and correcting 35mm slides. The weakness is in the feeder mechanism.1. It is fragile. Do not force it.3. Dump he tray that came with it. Won't even feed plastic slides well, Get their Universal Slide Tray (or any DIN 108 tray). I have scanned over 300 cardboard mounted slides with minimal problems using their DIN 108 tray.4. Occasionally a slide will hang up on insertion. The bottom corner catches. If you are quick you can tap the corner that is sticking up and it will feed ok.5. The Mac software us obviously ported (poorly) from the PC version. It lacks the sophistication and ease of use we Mac users have come to expect. But, it does work.6. Their phone help is very fast and is good.7. Unfortunately it is not """"fire and forget."" You need to keep an eye on it to catch potential jams.8. Don't save the images as TIFF. They can be huge - up to 90MB.All in all I am happy with the unit. I still have hundreds of slides to go."
5,Tac Recon Memories,"This is a superb work of research and writing by Doug Gordon. Text and photos in Chapters I through IV triggered vivid memories of my service in the 112th/1st TRS from 1952 to 1954 under the leadership of Lt. Col. Steven R. Wilkerson, Squadron CO. A night photo squadron, we experienced the good and the bad as we operated temporarily from picturesque Wiesbaden, Germany, the miserable conditions of Toul-Rosieres, France and finally Spangdahlem, Germany. We may have been regarded as vagabonds of a sort, but we accomplished our missions and held a party to end all parties in July 1953 in Bitburg to celebrate the completion of 10,000 accident-free flying hours in RB-26C aircraft: an outstanding record.A good read for those who appreciate this era in American aviation history."
4,"Great clock, just can't see it in the day","I really like this clock. Everything worked just as advertised. The auto time, remote weather, and projected display all worked great. In fact, the projected display worked all the way across my room with great clarity!The only about this clock is I cannot see it when there is light in my room. When I wake up after sunrise, I have go to the clock to see what time it it.When I walk through my room, I cannot glance over and see the time or the weather.Because of that, I returned the clock and am still in search of the ""right"" clock for us."
2,NO BACKLIGHT DISPLAY WITHOUT PUSHING BUTTON,"Very nice alarm clock, easy to set up. But huge draw back is that the time screen is not backlit, so if you want to see the screen you have to push a button. Very inconvenient!!!!!"
4,the funniest American comedy ever,"Get A life is really the only tv show to make me vomit from laughter, just kidding, but close. The only problem I have with Rhino's release is the poor packaging, and the limit of 2 shows per. I only wish I didn't lose my tapes of the original airings, but hopefully Rhino will release all the shows. Please buy this to support the show!!!!"
2,Not as good as I remembered,"I remembered this show as being the funniest thing I had ever seen, and I still stand by that review. I don't remember seeing any of these episodes the few times I was able to watch it on-air, though. If I had, I don't think I would have loved it so much. There are some great moments on this DVD, but most of the time it falls waaay short of the level of comedy I remember. I'm glad I bought the DVD and I will buy more if they come out but I was definitely diasppointed with their choice of episodes. Hopefully next time they'll do better."
5,Meticulously documented examples of individual court cases,"Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Alaska Natives And American Laws by David S. Case and David A. Voluck is a straightforwardly presented and extensively researched listing of American laws and their direct effect on the Native American communities of Alaska. The legal relationships of federal and state governmental laws, statutes, regulations and policies with respect to the indigenous populations of Alaska ranging from aboriginal titles, to a history of native services in Alaska, to Alaska Native claims to self-government and sovereignty. Meticulously documented examples of individual court cases add clarity to this solid and information-laden resource. Alaska Natives And American Laws is a seminal and valued contribution to Native American Studies reference collections."
4,"Great supportive nursing bra, weird sizing","For my 4th baby I wanted nursing bras that I could wear out of the house that were as supportive as my normal bras. This one is perfect. It is lined, so you can't see nursing pads through it, and it is comfortable and easy to nurse in.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the sizing is a bit off. (The band around the middle is smaller than usual, and the cup size seems bigger than usual.) I had to try on a few before I found the right fit. But once I did, I was good to go. And believe me, I have tried many nursing bras. This one has been great!!"
2,Nursing Bra,The bra could have been made better without the elastic staps that surround the breast. It is uncomfortable
3,Odd fit,"It'll get the job done, but the sides come out so your whole breast isn't covered. I feel like I'm not protected. If I got a size up then the sides would stick out. I just don't feel covered."
5,365 Tao: Daily Meditations,As a Taoist I find this book very good. It's inspiring and very easy to read. I highly recommend it.
2,not what I expected,"As another review said, I also do not feel some of the messages are very close to traditional Taoism.I was hoping for something that would give me a concept to meditate on each day.I wanted to read a passage in the morning that brought up something thought provoking that I could mull on over the day. I only read 5 days (one passage a day) and just felt like it wasn't what I expected. Maybe if I had given it more time? But life is too short to force through something you are not enjoying.All I am saying was it wasn't right for me. For you, it may be a different story.I highly recommend the Tao of Pooh. I felt like that DID frequently give me ideas to meditate on (but not in a one-a-day type format of course)."
3,Blah.,"If you really need a source of profundity and wise-sounding poems in your life, buy this. If you're content to find your own meaning in life or to glean it from literature or art, save your money."
2,More Self Serving Hype From The Dogtown Crowd,"Like the overhyped flick about the dogtown retards, this one is more focused on an individual who has done so little. It is the story of a serial addict first with skating, then tweeking, and now god. A big deal about nothing really. Lame story of a nobody. Good production quality though."
3,Coding style is important,"This book is really a set of rules for coding style. It is good for that, and has common sense rules. However for such a SMALL book, you pay a lot. The content fits in 118 pages that might be found on the web in various forms. So the value of the price is of question to me.The benefit of purchasing the book is that it makes it handy to look up a style format if you have questions. That is usually the only time I reach for this book - most of it I have been doing for a while.If you are trying to set a standard in your company/group/etc, and want people to have this, it would be a good one to fill the need. (It is suprising to find out how many people do not know these rules of style).I think that this book could have been published and sold for five dollars (US) - then I would have given it 5 stars. Its price is my only issue - not its content."
2,Don't bother,I found the book to be very expensive for the number of pages and content that it delivers. I found the Essential Java Style book much better value and filled with more common sense pointers....
2,These are 4T NOT 4.,"The website list this item as size 4, but what is on the receipt and shipped is 4T. I still need a few more words."
1,Total garbage,"I ordered these for my 10 and 12 y.o. kids as a surprise and wow it was a surprise when they broke during the first use.Seriously, don't be fooled by the ""body glove"" name as I was. These are no better than the cheap drugstore versions you can buy for 3.99.Save your money."
4,Smooth grooves,"Don't let the track titles confuse you, this CD is no joke. Filled with smooth beats, original sounds and eclectic mixes, this CD is a great addition to your electronic/dance/house collection. This CD has tunes ranging from smooth D&D to speed garage to break-beat. Check out threesixtyrecords.com (no I don't work for them, this is how I heard about the CD)"
4,"Academic, but very readable","Excellent study of the Boy Scouts at the turn of the century seen through the experiences of one troop at summer camp. Mechling's compression of twenty years into one narrative can be slightly confusing in places, but works well overall. Though he makes no effort to hide his personal views (supported by sociological reasearch and his own experiences as a Scout), he carefully illustrates the complexity of the issues confronting the organization as it heads into its second century. I could have done without the Freudian analysis of teenage boys' relationship to their bodies, but otherwise it's a very thoughtful and thought-provoking book."
2,Not a combo salt/pepper mill!,This is not a combo salt and pepper mill - It is a pepper mill with a salt shaker on the other end. I was disappointed.
1,Absolutely terrible. DO NOT BUY,"I bought this because I thought the design was beautiful and practical. The cap on the salt part comes off by accident while pouring salt, disposing the entire salt content on the food. This is a huge design flaw. Do not buy."
3,Heritage of Great Cowboy Music,"I can't believe only one other person besides me has written a review of this historical, great album. My opinion: SUPERB music, LOUSY recording standards. But what can you expect from something so old? Bottom line: Most of what we know about that era comes from hearsay. This is the real thing."
4,Sidesaddle,"I heard Sidesaddle live many years back and immediately bought this album. While I'm not a country music fan, I found their acoustic and vocal sound very upbeat and just plain fun to listen to."
5,Superb Protection,"This Micro-Case is gives excellent protection for whatever is placed in it. Build quality is solid and durable, even with rough treatment. Well thought out design. Good variety of sizes is available."
4,Beautiful!,I brought this teapot for my best friend as a gift along with a set of blooming teas. I'm very happy with the way that it looks and with the shipping. There were no scratches or any damages done during the shipping process and its the perfect size for tea with a friend.
2,"""Forget him"" is missing","Strangely enough, Bobby's great hit ""Forget Him"" is not included while the flip side of ""Forget Him"", ""Love love go away"" does not appear on this disk either."
4,Good secondary book on dealing with Mormon missionaries,"Good book on understanding Mormon missionaries and Mormons who are into their faith. It is not very good at dealing with lay Mormons, nor does it go into the semantics game one has to play when dealing with Mormons.It does a great job of dealing how Mormons do their missionary work, which is a ridged seven step program. This book details the first four visits. It also tells one how to deal with the selling points of Mormonism, which essentially is relying on emotion (aka ""burning in the bosom"") to accept Mormonism.I was recommended this book along side of ""The Mormon Scrapbook"" by Dan Thompson. Thompson's book is a better primer on Mormonism than Hutchinson's book."
4,Great Book,"These book is full of surprises. I read it in 1 day, simply because I wanted to find out who the killer was. You will be shocked once you find out who did it. The person who I thought was the killer wasn't the one. While reading you're going to be wrecking your brain trying to find the killer. I was upset with Maceo at the end of the story because he gave up a good woman. I can't wait to read the sequel to find out what happend to these characters; Maceo, Holly, Alixe and Cissy. Keep up the good work Nichelle and hurry up with the sequel."
5,Excellent!,"Okay, I should confess this isn't the type (urban, mystery) of book I would normally pick up to read. But, I couldn't put it down...it rushes along and pulls you in.Just read it!"
3,Complicated where it doesn't need to be,"The technical information described in this book goes into many details that Visual Studio protects the programmer from dealing with for the most part. while that knowledge might be beneficial for some it certainely does take away the space that could have been used to focus more on more important topics. I was hoping to get some useful information and examples on database software for the Pocket PC but didn't find more than I already knew. I personally think that this topic is quite important, and failing to give it enough attention is a major drawback to a book like this. Knowing what I know now I wouldn't buy this book. I found the Pocket PC SDK that comes with the embedded visual tools to be more informative."
4,A SOLID INVESTMENT,"BUY THIS BOOK ! This book is concise, detailed and a great way to get your head straight on the stressful purchase of a diamond. Cuellar does an excellent job of educating the reader on the four C's and how to get the best buy for their money. ( I know I did ... Thanks to this book I bought an engagement ring that appraised for more than 70% over what I paid ! ) Charts, worksheets, questionnaires ... and did I mention Cuellar's Helpline ! If you're thinking about making the big move to commitment, or are buying diamonds as an investment, Cuellar can become your best friend. Thanks, Fred !"
1,Book not worth the money,"I go in for surgery for my herniated disk in two days and nothing I read in this book informed me, encouraged me, or discouraged me from my decision. It's a very basic book if you know absolutely nothing about back pain, but as for any practical advice, there's very little. I especially looked for advice on exercises that are safe to do after surgery, but found none. What little info there is also seems very dated. I would have liked to see more than a tiny bit of info on types of surgery, etc. If the authors had spent their time on more research instead of ranting against managed health care, this might have been a decent and informative book. My advice: spend your money on another, more detailed and up-to-date book."
1,The stupidity of using this system to rank schools is laugha,"The stupidity of applying a system like this to rank schools would be laughable if there were not so many vulnerable college applicants who trust rankings like these. It ought to be a crime to mislead students with these rankings, when these students are trying to make a well-considered decision that will effect them the rest of their lives. A rip-off."
3,"ITS OK, NOTHING MAJOR",MORE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK THAN I THOUGHT. I TOOK A FEW WEEKS TO GET HERE. I EXPECTED IT TO ARRIVE SOONER LIKE MANY OTHER ORDERS.
1,"Lousy, Noisy, Smelly Fan",I bought this fan to use in the train platform during my commute to work. The fan was too noisy and was not very powerful. Plus the plastic smells terrible.
3,A strategy guide that needs a bit of polishing.,"First of all, this strategy guide reveals too much of the plot. Most gamers strictly want accurate information on weapons, spells, characters, and enemies. Good Role Playing strategy guides, such as the Final Fantasy VII guide by Versus, do not reveal the plot, and they have statistics and information that go in depth with character advancement. This book lacks precision in this aspect, and it left out many secret items and where to get them. It seems a bit sloppy in it's layout; especially in the bestiary and advancing monster characters to levels comparable with upper level monsters. However, to be fair, it reveals some good information that average players would not find on their own. I must say that this book needs to do more research on what players really want, and also revise before publishing. --Blaine Ginoza"
3,so-so,"this stratagy guide had a lot of stratagy, but all the lists were incorect, it seemed like David cassady (writer) had played the game but he should go back and check how many hit points the bosses have. I recomend it but don't depend on the stats."
4,GGGGGGGGGGGGREAT,"These are the COLUMBIA recordings Kitty made with Jack Teagarden and Harry James, however, ONLY as a Band Singer. She made some more recordings with Harry James in 1952, that are quite good, but those songs are not included here. I'd rather hear them than the two ""Alternate Takes"" on this Cd. But those alternates are good, I guess, for filler material. Regarding other ""Reviewers"" comments please bear in mind that as a solo artist Kitty recorded for other record labels, and these labels are still competeing with each other today. That is why those songs are not on this disc, see? Nice to see the Teagarden records issued on CD, even though that band didn't do well commercially. When Kitty joined Harry James in 1944, she might have been the best band vocalist out there. Almost every song was a major hit, and her voice pretty much represented the Harry James ""sound"" during 1944-45."
2,No Certificate!!,Where is the certificate? I am not very happy with my purchase here. For $500 I would expect a nicer box and a certificate. Overall the diamonds do look nice.
1,Didn't live up to expectations,"It isn't ""a valuable resource for all readers"", but might be to those who don't mind cheesy graphics and those who want to see what they could've learned from the Windows XP help menu. I thought the tips would enhance my knowledge of XP beyond what I already know, but was very disappointed. There are other more informative ""illustrated"" XP guides out there."
4,Great Alternate Versions Of These Classics,"Two of the tracks on this album, ""Time"" and ""Return Of The Giant Hogweed"" were covers by other groups. Both were done very well. Of the two, I enjoyed Out Of Phase's version of Time the most. ""Can Utility & The Coastliners"", originally written and recorded by Genesis on their Foxtrot album, was performed by Brand X on this album. This is understandable as Phil Collins was a drummer for Brand X. They do an excellent version of this song. Nectar and Marillion present their own songs of which I preferred ""One Fine Day"" by Marillion. Rick Wakeman does a fine job on the Yes song ""And You And I"". The main reason to buy this album is the 30 minute version of Rick Wakeman's own song ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"". I love this version -- it is mp3 player worthy!!!"
5,Excellent book,"This just what I need, after having lost my wife in October. There are many good suggestions that have been helpful to me."
1,about as deep as a magazine article,"I was very disappointed in this book - I felt I could have written it myself, using platitudes and the type of jargon one finds in a women's magazine article. I would have preferred more concrete advice, instead of touchy-feely pseudo-psychology. I didn't learn a thing I didn't already know."
2,Product is great but the delivery is bad.,"No question with the product. It proves helpful specially in digestion and bowel movement. But, one thing I don't like is how the delivery is handled. I bought 6 cans of the product and 3 cans of it have puncture at the bottom. I suggest Amazon will do something about it like the packaging for example."
3,"Good, but grain size could be smaller","I bought this because I wanted an alternative to the orange flavored Metimucil (it wasn't the orange flavor I minded...it was the sucrose and food coloring). This looked very promising: cheap and simple.This product gives you the results you expect. Ghost poo? Check. But I give it 3 stars because the grain size is pretty huge. When I mix it with water, most of it floats to the top, and no matter how much I stir, it stays at the top. Drinking it isn't much fun, either, since the grains are so large. It coats and scratches its way down my mouth and throat. Maybe I'm missing something. But they could grind this into a fine powder, like Metimucil.For the benefits, it's a fairly small price to pay. But it can definitely be better."
5,"Soul satisfying, never tire of listening to this at bedtime","I bought Desert Winds about four years ago. It's music you can live with - and love a lot - for a long time, except perhaps for the deliberately in- your-face ""The Computer Is Down."" If you liked the music of Trapezoid, Freyda Epstein lends vocals and her violin moves sinuously and lightly around Seth Austen's guitar and Ralph Gordon's bass and cello which seems to anchor the CD's ethereal majesty. My two favorites are ""Be"" in which Freyda E. provides vocals, and ""Moonrise"" which seems to combine feelings of wistful longing and restless unease about a world teeming with possibilities. Ralph Gordon and Austen make Monk's ""Around Midnight"" really fly, too."
5,A typical masterpiece.,"As are all of Sparks books, this one is a masterpiece. It defines the church and the mystery (secret) of God pertaining to the church. It takes you to a different level of understanding altogether. There are Parts one and two of this book and this one is part one. You need to read part 2 also."
4,Great especially for the price !,"If you're looking for a Golf organizer for the garage, I highly recomend this one. I gave it four stars only because it was not powder coated as advertised but just plainly painted black. As others have indicated, the directions appear to have been written by an engineer and a bit hard to follow but you don't have to be one or even a mechanic to put it together. It took me about 45 minutes and I'm an average home mechanic. So....for the price of under $50.00 this is a real good deal.Golf Club Organizer Rack"
1,Hugely overrated,"This book is a dud. I don't understand how it has gained such a hyped-up reputation. I use technical analysis in managing a small hedge fund and have found dozens of books on technical analysis that are more useful than this one. This book will bore you into a coma with its fuzzy, unfocused babbling and surprising lack of insight. The bible of technical analysis continues to be John Murphy's ""Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets."""
4,"Great book, but overdue for a revision","One of the best books on the subject but a lot has changed in the past 8 years. I'd like to hear what Pring has to say about trading on the Internet and, in particular, trading Internet stocks."
1,waste of breath,Just another compilation of technical analysis. a dismal science explained in a long winding way . the book could have been chopped to 150 pages
5,best wwii book i've read,"I'm in the middle of reading this book and am enjoying it immensely. What I really like about it compared to the usual on-the-ground, in-the-trenches books, like the ones by Stephen Ambrose, Cornelius Ryan, etc. is that this one is about what the people at the highest levels were doing and deciding; the politicians, generals, and admirals. It's excellent at providing an analysis of the overall world war and how things happening on one side of the globe affected things on the other. He's also very good at not playing favorites and points out mistakes made by both sides, of which there were plenty."
3,ok movie on a great dvd-r disc.,"saw this on betamax in 1980,ok late night viewing,then a big box vhs,but now a top of the range dvd release,nice to see film crystal clear at last,it`s like watching for the first time,a pity movie is not top rate entertainment,ok story of middle east problems,some action but film tries to please everyones point of view on the subject and comes off looking very cheesy at the end,if you want a no brainer late at night,as we found back in 1980 on beta it`s ok,but would not be high on anybodies owning list,and Mitchum and Hudson look and feel too old for the parts they play."
1,Save Your Money!,"When I first listened to this CD, I thought it was defective and had it replaced. I was mistaken. The sound quality is tinny and echoes -- like a garage recording. If you are a fan of Monna Bell, you may not recognize her. In addition to the inferior technical quality, her classics have been ""updated"" in this 70's recording to a disco beat. I haven't listened to it since, and cannot recommend it."
5,Classic movie,"My wife will never tire of watching this film. Zellweger did and excellent job in this movie, she really put everything into it. One to keep and watch again when you need cheering up."
1,Bridget Jones's Bogus Journey,"The bogus journey of one Bridget Jones, as she attempts to break the shackles of her terrible singlehood. The original premise of this movie (a woman finding love in all the wrong places, and giving up) is a pleasant deviation from romantic comedies, but it starts looking more like a train-wreck after the first twenty minutes.The most saliant problem with this movie is, who is it trying to fool ? Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is obviously too attractive and intelligent to still be single at 30-something. This is an utterly pointless premise.Bridget Jones' Diary is, simply said, a caricature of single life. Most of its characters are caricatures, that only exist to either torment Bridget about being single, to be the stereotypical ""group of friends"", or antagonists. Since this movie has no substance, it does not deserve any more praise than its original premise does."
1,Not worthy of all the hype.,"Cannot believe the excellent reviews this movie got! I found it boring, stupid and absurd. Hugh Grant looks old and tired, the latter may have been after reading the script. He needs to fire his agent for choosing this movie, after having done some good roles in 'Four weddings and a funeral' and 'Nine months'. Zellweger is pathetic, so is Colin Firth. Overall, just a big disappointment."
1,A waste of time and money...,"Bridget Jone's Diary has to have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Renee Zellweger's performance was weak at best. The only time the film was the slightest bit funny was when Bridget was being made a fool of and when Hugh Grant was being a male showvenist, which isn't all that funny. Don't waste your time or money on this terrible film. The genre of the british love comedy has been done to death."
3,Very different from the book!!!!,"I was so excited to see this movie after reading the book. To me, it was a big let down. The book was so much better!!!!The movie itself, was kind of funny and had some good parts to it but don't expect it to follow along with the book. The left a lot of parts out that, in my opinion, should have been in there. The ending was was way different. The outcome was still the same it just happened different. I think I would have enjoyed it much better had I not read the book first."
5,My Favorite Movie,"This is my absolute favorite movie in the world. Bridget is a woman for every one of us who have ever felt stupid, needed to lose 15 pounds, drank too much at one sitting, suffered through our parents' nuttiness or vowed to change ourselves in a year's time. Renee Zellweger does an absolute smashing British accent and is absolutely hilarious. Hugh Grant is hysterical if not maddening as Bridget's womanizing boss with whom she has a fling, and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy, the man Bridget is attracted to while at the same time vowing how much she hates him, is simply to swoon over. The language is a bit raw, but it adds to the hilarity. If you need a laugh or need a not-so-perfect fellow female to relate to, settle in with this film. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Brilliant, Down-To-Earth Romantic Comedy - A Classic","This movie is by no-means a chick-flick and anybody who thinks it is knows very little about women! Every person I know - male and female enjoyed this movie for it's great down-to-earth humour and social realism. It's a breath of fresh air and fills you with a sense of normality and hope. Full marks to Renee who is totally convincing and gorgeous. So many people will be able to relate to this movie, providing that they are of course as natural, unpretentious and real as Bridget herself. Hallaluyah - real thighs do still exist in the movies!!"
1,Disappointed Pride and Prejudice Fan,"This Pride and Prejudice fan was hoping for a modern-day movie with a storyline much closer to Pride and Prejudice. Even Colin Firth could'nt save this one for me! On its own I found it sadly lacking in just about everything I look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor. If you are a true Pride and Prejudice fan, I recommend buying the BBC series and the 2005 movie version. Both are excellent. I would'nt waste my time again with this one."
5,Great movie!,A classic romantic comedy British style. Rene Zellweger does the English accent well. For all romance fans.
4,"Funny, Cute and Insightful","I didn't think I would like this movie but I did. Renee does her best by talking with an accent. Again, this isn't one of those ""everyone is going to love it"" movies. Silly romance and one woman's opinion about the opposite gender. I hate that they played so much on her being soooo overweight (where? her fingers??) because it isn't very realistic. Nonetheless, it's a cute date movie and worth buying."
5,Grab this one!,"I think this movie may have just moved up to one of my favorites. I saw it in the theater and counted the days until I could buy it. For those of you who read the book - watch the movie, it is just as good if not better. And even if you didnt read the book, the movie will make you want to."
4,To Bridget: who we love just as she is,"This is a bit of a fluff piece although it has its virtues. Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones is very charming and likeable. Alas, the characters are almost all caricatures albiet well done. The guy who hawks jewelry on TV was perfect. But caricatures only go so far. And competent Mark Darcy's attraction for incompetent Bridget Jones is a stretch. Nevertheless, it doesn't matter much because you're happy for her.The music was well done, and in the right moments."
4,A Definite Watch Movie!,"I wasn't too sure I wanted to see this movie until it came on accidentally while I was painting a room. I could only see some of the movie but heard all of it which was enough for me to rent it and see it end to end. It was wonderful, if you like movies like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and very witty. Hugh Grant plays the part oh too well based upon his previous roles which he seems typecast into. Not a problem as he is good at it."
3,Missing parts,"This unit looked to be high quality, but I had to return it because it was missing one fo the set screws to hold it against the tank."
5,Dreamy and Sublime - As Easy As Shakespeare Gets,"As a teenager in the UK in the 70s I was a rabid Genesis fan. Now I have grown into more classical tastes and I was not expecting this to live up to either genre. But I am surprised and delighted by this beautiful music. Steve's guitar playing is gorgeous and reminds me of Segovia playing the classics but somehow with more feeling if that's possible. The music exudes a dreamy magic and some of the themes, especially the orchestral ones representing nature (sea, mountains and clouds), are sublime, reminding me of my favourite parts of Vaughan Williams symphonies. Listening to this wonderful music is as easy as Shakespeare gets and grows better the more you play it."
2,Very uneven,"Parts of these sessions have well-executed Weaver-like harmonies, and rollicking, if simplistic, accompanyment. Other parts, however, lapse into overstylized and musically tasteless excesses, especially on some of the solo parts. Plane Wreck at Los Gatos is well done. Fans of Judy Henske may want to get this disc given how little material she's recorded over the years (although most is now in print for the first time in decades). Overall, though, not worth the sum of its parts."
2,Shoulda paid more for something else.,"I'm somewhat happy with this pressure cooker set. It takes a while to seal, and won't seal if it's not on high heat, so it's hard to make food you can burn, like rice. I think this is because it has safety features not found on old pressure cookers, but perhaps more expensive brands/models don't have this flaw. It's also hard to figure out how to use. The pressure valve label is confusing to some - the correct positioning is 180 opposite from what it appears. Only cooks at 8 psi and 12 psi, not 15 psi (250F), so it requires about 20% more cooking time (at 12 psi) than a 15 psi cooker. Didn't realize this when I bought it. For the $[...] I paid, it is OK. I wish I'd bought a better cooker; I'm pleased with the results.[...]"
3,Interesting but NOT a beginner's book,"I am an intermediate level Italian speaker. I agree with other reviewers that the language is often archaic. In addition, many of these pieces were written in old regional dialects that you probably won't see very often. It's fun to try to read the literature in the original language but as a learning exercise it's a two-edged sword."
2,Intensely Freudian,"I knew when I bought the book that the writer would approach the topic from a Freudian perspective, which I don't necessarily think is always the best but I was willing to check it out. I also didn't know that he was going to be speaking almost exclusively of famous authors through analysis of their writing. It comes off as more of an academic exercise (albeit a skilled one) than one having much to do with me reality in parenting a previously abused child."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,i really like basketball i have one for every system exept gameboy and gameboy advance i thought it would be cool but if you are the kind of person who wants a realist game this is not the one for you first of all you only get to use two players on the court the people can make a basket from anywere on the court just about all the time and the people jump to the celling and instead of stealing the ball they trip you or push you over but if you do not want a realist play agaist the rule games this may be the game for you
3,Not fair!,"Hey, I appreciate the effort of making an NBA game but it's not enough, there has to be more than one basketball game on GBA. I think that they should make NBA Showtime or NBA Street or NBA Live on GBA. These are some of the best basketball games on different systems. On N64, I loved NBA Showtime, I'm sure that there are many other people that want to see this game on GBA. On PS2, NBA Live and NBA Street are the best basketball game on the system. If I had the chance to make video games, I would make all of these game for GBA. If you think that I am right and want more basketball games on GBA, write reviews to tell them this!"
1,Suck!!!,"I watched this lame video. This video sucked and lame. This is so fake and does not scared me a lot. I gave no star to this video but rate required me to rate this video...so, I gave this one star suck!"
5,My Favorite!,"I own the entire Gundam Seed anime and this is by far my favorite DVD in the series, this is were things really star to heat up and Kira is introduced to his future wife Lacus Clyne( They get married in the Gundam Seed Destiny OAV). I also love the T.M Revolution Music video on this DVD, I highly recommend it."
4,quite funny,"i found this book at my school's library, and i enjoyed it. a lot of the jokes are ones that he also used in his films, but that did not deter the fact that they are funny.worth checking out from a library for a nice rainy day read if you like woody allen.plus, the drawings are exactly the same as the cartoon bit in ""Annie Hall"""
4,Buckminster Fuller did the intro. Really!,This has an amazing hand drawn and typewritten intro by THE Buckminster Fuller.It is actually brilliant and profound... It explains the whole nature of reality through geometry.
4,Fan favorite,"The product is in excellent condition but, i can tell the box was opened and retaped again. I believe the product was used not new"
2,Beethoven Sonatas,"While I grant that ""Boxed set"" is not specifically billed as a complete set of Beethoven Sonatas, it would imply that it was It was not in fact a complete set, missing, at minimum Opus 2 No 1, Opus 111, and Opus 14, No 1."
5,Certainly one of the top sonata sets,"As a huge Gilels and Beethoven fan I had to get this.As with most others I am very saddened that the complete set wasn't recorded.Especially Op.111Listening to this set opens up a whole new world of Beethoven.The rich warm sound of Gilels is an absolute joy to listen to and it has made me rediscover beautiful sections in many sonatas.I found myself deeply moved by Op.10 No. 3 again for instance.I think Gilels' Waldstein is the best I have ever heard and I love the fire of his Appassionata.The CDs come in cardboard envelopes inside a cardboard box. So its budget, but that just makes it more affordable.One of the sets you have to own.I bought the Pollini set of late sonatas to compliment the set and it serves very well."
4,Reader's Digest Canned Christmas Songs,This VHS tape has 44 canned Christmas songs and matching canned videos running for just under 2 hours. The artists for the music are unknown. The quality of the music is average to above average. The tape lacks excitement because there are so many songs and they do not seem that distinctive. I gave the video 4 stars instead of 3 due to the fact that some of the songs reach the level of 4 stars.
1,totally down after several uses,"I met the same problem. For the first several uses, the cooker works very well, fast and convenient. But after that, after cooking for several minutes, the steam and the water will leak out suddenly from somewhere around the cover.It is very dangerous and I had to trash it."
1,Don't Get This Game,"Do not get this game! The graphics are really bad. The crowd is paper thin yet the picture on it looks 3-D. Not what I would expect from a Gamecube. The controles are confusing. I don't understand the concept of hitting the ball, you get the little triangle shape on the ball and it moves when you have no chance of hitting it. The main screen print is almost so tiny I can barely read it. The sound is not that bad. Its basically the best thing about the game. Overall, the game royally sucks so don't get it! If you do you'll regret it, I know I sure did. Its the worst (money) I've spent in my life."
5,Rogue Leader Best Star Wars Game Yet,"This is a wonderful game with a lot of new features, much better control than previous games! I actually was not going to acquire the GameCube but did so because of this game and I am not sorry! If you enjoyed Rogue Squadron - you will revel in this sequel. Happy flying and may the force be with you!"
5,Rouge Leader Leads the way to a new era.,"Ah, where to being with such a great game as this one? Well, I can say without a doubt this game will be a must have for most GameCube fans, and is probably the starting games for most out there. I'm sure you all know the story line by now, and if not, shame on you! But, in brief, this one picks up where the N64 version left off, you start out in the Death Star, and work your way up to Return of the Jedi, the last movie installment so far. This game's great, and be sure to check this one out as soon as possible this is definatly one you won't wanna miss!"
5,THE FORCE,"I have played this game and i know what i am talking about below is my grade.200/100 Graphics- Yes its that good. The game seems like a movie and shots from it look like movie stills. Expect for your eyes to bleed.100/100 Gameplay- Fight the Empire thru 13 levels. This game also tells you the history of Rogue Squadren. Ahhh the sound of screaming ties when the blaster hits them...BBBOOOOMMMM!!!!100/100 Controls- Let me personally congratulate the producers upon making the game controls seem goddly. The controls are so ez to get used to.200/100 Replay Ability- Time for the can of coke to help keep me awake to play this. Once you think youve beaten the game you find out you really havent. 5 bonus missions + all the gold medals and power-ups you have to get( they took out platinum.)I reconmmend this game to everyone who has a gamecube. Lucas Arts never lets you down. Also try Star Wars: Rogue Squadren for the n-64. Bye, its 2.45 am and i have to get the gold on hoth.;)"
2,how did gamespot give this a 9?,"Im sure in the dawn of next gen consoles this was the cream of the crop but nowadays we expect more. Im not talking about graphics, Im talking about gameplay. This game is waay too linear and boring. What really bugged me is the death star attack. Was luke,wedge,and biggs the only rebels fighting against the death star??? The attack on the death star was a huge battle, and so dire taht it the rebels lost theyd be as crewed as thai hooker. So why would only send three fighters to take care of a colossus weapon like the death star? Also, luke isnt such a good main character, he gets annoying after...around the second mission. So why does it get the two? because it works, you shot ti-fighters, and its star wars."
3,Average Game,"When I first played this game it rocked. Awesome graphics, good first missions, and nice gameplay. However there is only 11 main missions with a few bonus ones. Plus some of the later missions seem like they were just facelifted from the N64 game. Plus some of the missions are just to hard to do for an eveyday gamer like myself. I would suggest a RENTAL AT THE MOST. But a must for Star Wars fans."
4,A good game,My first gamecube game. It's a great game with challenging levels and great sound and graphics.I would have given it five stars but for the simple fact that some levels are too hard and it's easy to just give up and lose interest. Look for a guide if you're going to buy this game.
5,This game rocks,This game is great for Star Wars fans and fighter plane enthusiasts alike. It is very very fun.
4,This game is fun,I personaly liked this game. some levels were hard but eventially you will pass them. the cool part is that you can be on the darkside on some bonus levels. the graphics are good and you can use cooler ships than the nintendo 64 game. if you really want some cooler ships like the slave 1 put in a code. you will like this game if you buy it.
4,Cool!!,"This game is very fun.Although it lacks a two player mode, the one player mode makes up for it. The graphics are great, the levels in space look very real. The gameplay is also very good. The controls are perfect and the missions are fun to play. They are ther perfect level of difficulty. The game is lots of fun. Get it now!!"
3,"Star Wars: Rogue Leader-Good Game, but not the best....","Star Wars: Rogue Leader is a classic game......it follows the path of the movies VERY closely, but the missions that weren't in the movies feel tacked on, especially the ""Razor Rendezvous"" level. The controls are good, the graphics are great, but that doesnt make a great game. The overall Fun Factor does. But this game is just TOO HARD. Sure, difficulty is good, but I get frustrated when for the 100th tiime in a row my transports get destroyed by TIE Interceptors on the VEngeance on Kothlis level. The game is very short too.....OK, thats about it...But now im going to post the best and the worst levels in this game, and the difficulty:BEST LEVELS1. Battle of Endor- VERY HARD2. Death Star Attack- EASY (If youre good)3. Battle of Hoth- EASY (If youre good)WORST LEVELS1.Prisons of the Maw- HARD2. Ison Corridor Ambush- MEDIUM3. Strike at the Core- MEDIUM (If youre good)"
5,Buy It!!!,"This was a GREAT game. The graphics are awesome, and the missions are exciting. The game is better than the first, except for one thing. There are only 14 levels in this game, including the bonus levels. But this doesn't matter when you consider how great the other parts of the game are. This game is a must have."
2,"Great graphics, but difficult","The graphics are awsome on this game, it actually makes you feel like you're in the movie. But the graphics are the only good part. The gameplay is so difficult that it makes it no fun at all. You can't even really look at the graphics because you have to use the targeting computer to even see your targets! I'm 15 and this game is still hard for me. Just make sure before you buy this game that you know it will be difficult."
3,Excellent SW Game!,"This game is a must for SW fans that own a Game Cube. The action is great and the handling and controls are fairly easy. I like the wide variety of ships you can utilize throughout the levels of gameplay. The enemies sometimes seem to bombard you, but like I said a must for action and SW fans"
1,Yet another Rehash :(,"While the graphics on this game are much improved over its counterpart on the N64, the gameplay absolutely wreaks. It's as dull as it was on the N64, only the graphics on this game have been improved. Don't believe the hype on this stinker, you will regret it."
3,Its ok!,This DVD is ok! Its cheap price but video encoding isnt all that great. Alot of the audio is not synced to the video. Better idea is just to download the vids ur self and burn them. Alot of these old cartoons are no longer copyrighted anymore so there people out there who make there own Dvds of them and sell them and I think that is the case with this cheaply made DVD.
4,A holiday favorite that doesn't get old...,"This CD has become a holiday favorite in our household. This generous recording consists primarily of less well-known, yet accessible, classical songs, all beautifully sung and expertly recorded. Unlike a lot of Christmas music, the selections here hold up well play after play. We've found that this CD makes a wonderful and welcome stocking stuffer for our friends who want to add some class and sophistication to their Christmas CD collection."
