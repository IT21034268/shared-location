5,Great service/quality,"As always, Amazon delivers. The books were in excellent condition and received in a timely manner."
3,Satisfying conclusion,"Shadow of the Giant provides a pleasing, if not surprising, finale to the Bean saga--and leaves potential openings for Card to revisit the Ender universe. The writing is on par with the other Bean stories, and doesn't degenerate into massive passages of exposition about politics like the two previous books. Also, because the main foil of Shadow of the Hegemon and Shadow Puppets died at the end of the latter book, it doesn't dwell on what was ultimately a poorly developed villain and instead focuses on the protagonists. Unfortunately, that focus too often reveals that the protagonists aren't really that interesting. As usual, most of the supporting cast, with the exception of Peter Wiggin, is underdeveloped and has mostly stock (and culturally stereotyped) characteristics. Still, for those already invested in the previous books, Shadow of the Giant is a satisfying send-off for one of science fiction's most underappreciated characters in Julian ""Bean"" Delphiki."
1,buyer beware,after 5 months it just stopped working. Currently in process of getting warranty service
1,Haier HDN305 not wortht the money,"We purchased this model on May 30, 2008. It seemed to run good last year, but does not work this year. The compressor does not work. I do not consider dehumidifiers to be disposal products so strongly beleive they should last longer then 1 year.It should also be noted the unit when we bought it said it was energy star. However, when applying for our energy star rebate, we came to find out that it had been removed from the list a more then a year before we purchased it. False advertising if you ask me. When contacting their customer support about that they had NO clue what energy star meant. The lady said ALL appliances are required to be energy star. In all dealing with Haier has been a pain and I would not buy another one of their products."
5,IT'S WONDERFUL. HOW COME I'VE NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE?,"was driving my car and this piece started to play on my radio. I was knocked out by the interplay between the orchestra and the piano. I've listened to many piano concerti before and I love; Liszt,Rachmaninoff,Beethoven and Bartok to name just a few. I found this composition to rate with any of these composers. I was bouncing with the syncopation of the play between the piano and the orchestra and the slow passages were bringing tears to my eyes.If a piece of music can get a reaction out of a listener, what more could you ask for? I can see why it would not be performed live,if either the pianist or the orchestra miss a beat, it's over! I wish some major pianists would record it, I'm sure it would receive more recognition and also Henry Litoff."
3,Chapultepec: A Misnamed Story,"Chapultepec is an interesting romantic story set against the backdrop of the French invasion and adventure in Mexico during the 1860's. When this reader thinks of Chapultepec, however, the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846-1848 and the mythic defense and destruction of the students of Mexico's Military Academy comes most quickly to mind. In this novel the incident is mentioned and used as a plot tool. Chapultepec castle is featured, but neither the castle nor the incident is really central to the story. Because writer makes frequent use of expressions in Spanish and French, some familiarity with both languages is helpful for the reader."
1,not pleased,I have original set of this Dansk flatware pattern. needed to add some pieces and ordered a dinner knife. It was not true to the pattern and also said it was made in Vietnam!
5,HAPPY GRANDSON,"MY GRANDSON REQUESTED THIS MOVIE EARLY IN THE YEAR, AND AMAZON.COM HAS HELPED ""MIMI"" KEEP A PROMISE.THANK YOU FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF YOUR WEBSITE, AND THANK YOU FOR A FINE PRODUCT.CAROLYN KENNEDY"
2,Santa Buddhas,"The dogs in this movie are very cute. No question asked. I thought kids would enjoy the movie yet after watching it for about 20 minutes with 2 kids, both had their attention concentrated somewhere else. Cute dogs dressed as santas are simply not the only ingredients necessary to make a movie work. Let's not offend the kid's intelligence. Santa losing his fake beard, making the movie appear to have more with zen and Buddhism than with Christianity, an evil and scary dog catcher - who can make this kind of stuff up? There are plenty of good movies about Christmas out there. This one just isn't one of them."
4,Fun for kids,"I bought this DVD for our 1 year old son as a Christmas present. We also have a golden retriever, so this was a fun movie for us to enjoy as a family. Don't expect any great dialogue in this film, just a cute kids movie for the holidays."
2,Santa Bummers,"My wife loved it but I thought it a another bad, cheap Christmas production movie. I would recommend it for a Day School to watch."
3,Budderball for Christmas,"My daughter developed an attachment to a BUDDERBALL plush from one of the other films, when she saw the cover for this she was excited as she recognized him. This is a paint by numbers holiday Disney movie that has a very capable cast who are forced to carry the predictable humor and heart through to the finish. My 2 year old liked it for awhile when the dogs are up to their tricks, and my 8 year old wanted to like it but he lost interest as well. The package is exceptional with a DVD included as back up/kid copy either way I love these two packs, and the image is reliably impeccable in HD format, I just wish the whole set was centered around a less maudlin film. Not the best of the Buddies but if you like them and wanted a holiday sequel you got one, but it shamelessly pulls the old heart strings."
3,Christmas has gone to the dogs,A very cute movie with some adorable puppies for sure. This will appeal to most animal lovers and kids . The buddies must help Santa Paws save christmas. To do this they must believe and get others to believe in the spirit of Christmas. Ofcourse it trys to make you think the true meaning of Christmas is about Santa and so on. Not the best thing to teach kids but I suppose the hearts are in the right place. ChristmaS is about more than Santa and presents. Its about a child born unto us. But you get the idea. A cute movie worth a watch to just go Awwwww at all the cute pups
4,Dio still has it and then some.,I only give this four stars because of a couple of throw away songs in the set list. This is a really good concert though.
4,"easy to use, simply plug it in.",The device is very easy to use. You simply plug a pair of XE103 into power socket and you have your computer hooks up to the internet. The speed is roughly about the same as usb wireless card.The network speed will slow down noticeably if you use both wireless and powerline adapter.
4,Good Book But To Much Boys,I liked the book a lot but there was a little to much boys and kissing in it. I would like to see more mystery than boys.
4,"Better than average, informative","Gave this to my fiance' for Christmas and he was very pleased. He said it was very informative, and as an experienced fisherman, said he actually learned new tactics. Buy it!"
3,Survivorman...,We have season 1 of Surviorman and thought it was much better than this one. Our family didn't think it was exciting as the previous season.
5,Survivorman Rocks,"I was hooked on Survivorman the first time I saw it. Les Stroud shows you the essentials on surviving in some of the most forbiding places on earth. Though I am also a Bear Grylles fan, I think Survivorman shows more of a practical, realistic approach to survival. I was saddened to see that Survivor man is ending it's series, I think. However, I own season 1 and will no doubt get 2 and 3. Long Live Survivorman!"
2,Nothing new,"I thought this book might give me some breakthrough short term tips, but it is the same old stuff. I have always wanted to be a writer, but when I see how many pages a writer takes to say something that could be said in about ten percent of the time,I realize I am to much of a get to the point guy to be a writer--Another words this like so many other investment books, should be and article instead of a book."
2,Kare Kano: His and Her Circumstances #3,"One of the cahiers at Hi-De-Ho comics in Santa Monica declared that THIS was her favorite series. Of course I had to have it.She got more out of it then I did. I was expecting a romance. It's cute. The art is very primitive. It has its moments.I thought to myself, ""this must be a GUY thing"". So, I lent it to my niece. She got less out of it then I did."
1,Doesn't live up to its hype.,"I bought the book looking for specific recommendations for investments to protect our money through Y2K (and, perhaps, to turn a profit.) What I found were generalities such as ""Get out of debt,"" which we have already done. The book's self-reviews, which were the only ones listed at the time I ordered the book, implied specific schedules for the buying and selling of specific stocks. Instead, what I found was a 144-page advertisement for Epp's newsletter. The book was a big disappointment."
4,"Good, but it doesn't have the remix","Both of these songs are excellent, but if you want the smooth ""Spend My Life With You"" REMIX (with Terry Dexter instead of Tamia), you'll have to buy the CD single for Terry Dexter's ""Strayed Away""."
5,simply lovely,"beautiful lyrics, incredible harmony, esp. with eric and tamia's background vocals. tamia has not sounded this good since ""you put a move on my heart"" and eric is so talented. he is a complete package."
1,It is the most-boring book I have ever bought and read,"I bought this book because my instructor is the worst in her area.So I hoped that this will help me but never saw that help.The book is written in a very boring manner and includes no motivation ,no interest!"
1,huh?,"Forcing and brutalising one's wife is a crime. While I understand passion and all that's involved in a relationship, I hated that saying ""I love you"" excuses the H's overly harsh behaviour to the point of rape."
5,Great Product,I use these containers to organize various connectors and adapters for Computer Networking as well as Audio/Visual. They have made things much easier to find. I will definitely be purchasing another.
3,Good - Not great,"Does anyone use a tackle box for fishing tackle anymore? Anyway, this tackle box holds a lot of stuff! I have my saltwater, trolling, bass gear, and panfish gear all compartmentalized and that part works great. The dividers feel cheap to me, and hooks and swivels seem to always get mixed up underneath the dividers. I'd almost rather just have set compartments without the adjustable dividers so things can't sneak under. The top offers a lot of storage, mine seems to be filled with rubber worm packages and extra line, but it would have been nice if there was a divider made specifically for this space (other than the spinner bait box they sell). Anyway, it works, and I can keep it in my boat for all of my fishing ""expeditions""...Oh yeah, if rain gets on it, everything inside will have to be removed to dry it out - so remember that since not all fishing days are fun in the sun..."
4,Easy to use.,Great little item for storing small screws and nails etc. Easy to see what you have and is a good basic organizer.
5,"Awesome Product, Awesome Price","I'm a private contractor and have hundreds of small electrical and mechanical parts to keep track of, these are cheap, durable, and i love them, And you can't find anything else nearly as good for the price!! Highly recommended!"
1,belltowerbooks is bad,Belltowerbooks provides very poor service and Amazon should not do business with them. I still do not have a book ordered several months ago.
5,Excellent storytelling: A sit on the edge of your seat book.,"The Seventh Power, By James Mills was the first of his i have read. Every page was filled with intense suspense and even fear sometimes. If you like books that mess with your brain, and that keep you up at night thinking about it, this book is for you. And just when you think you have all the puzzles figured out, something happens and you must keep reading. You'll love this book."
2,Lacks modern features,"This program will not import bit mapped graphics files, or files created by newer versions of AI. I could not really use it."
1,Please save your money and try a different book - maybe a 'real' classic,"Clunky, poorly crafted, poorly edited and inplausible. Not interesting or compelling, even if you yearn for a flashbook to a Cold War era novel. Was stuck deployed for the military and had the choice between some Carrier-series novels and 2-week old USA Today. After the first 2 chapters, I was looking for the old newspaper."
4,Foosball / Pool / Air Hockey review,"Unlike the other reviews, the product arrived undamaged. Overall, I'm very happy with the 3-in-1 game table....my boys love it. I couple of small things prevent me from giving 5 stars:- The foosball men are solid red (or blue) from head to toe...differs from the picture where the men have white shorts. Not a big deal, but my old college table had the red/white and blue/white men. I think the picture should be accurate. Also, if you score a goal with a really slow roller, the ball will fall out onto the floor. If you hit it hard and score the ball will stay in the goal.- The air hockey goals are not deep enough to allow the puck to go all the way in on a goal.- No issues with the pool table."
5,The only current punk band that knows what it's doing,"Previous reviewers all seem to have different favorite songs - that's a good sign. It means that all the songs are good. My favorites keep changing. Right now I really like ""X-Ray Specs"" and ""Phantom Maggot."" I see they'll soon be releasing another album. That's great news."
3,Good but not super,"I just purchased this monitor to replace my Compaq 2025. I liked the integrated speakers and the TV tuner, picture in picture and so forth. The picture quality however is good but not as good as the Compaq and less than I expected after spending [this amount of money]. I like the 2025 better than this (and it's half the price). Maybe the combo idea is not that great after all and it's best to get a good LCD and a good TV (separate)."
2,good for couple of months only,The Band of the watch lost its golden tone and turned into white :(The Diamonds look nice...but its just an average watch nothing too special about it. All you will be left with is steel Band and diamonds on the black dial.
3,Gin Rummy: How to play and win,Alittle too basic. I learned some things from this book was a liile disappointed that it did not cover much about the strategy of the game.
4,Baby Einstein- Neighborhood Animals,I bought this for my three month old grandson. I was very surprised at how long it kept his attention. The colorful animals are presented in just the right way for younger children.
5,"Love, Love, Love It!!!","My 13 month old baby boy loves this video. In fact, he loves most all the Baby Einstein videos. I rank this in my top five right alongside ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time"" and ""Singing Babies Toddler Tunes,"" which are also my son's favorites. In fact, next to the Baby Einstein Company, the Singing Babies Company seems to best understand what young babies want to watch. Get ""Neighborhood Animals"" and give ""Singing Babies"" a try, too."
2,not up to par,"very boring -sadly this was the first tape we bought and i will not purchase any others.the dog puppet makes a variety of animal noises - hes a dog why is he making other animal noises.this did not hold the babys attention, and i found it to be annoying to listen to after the first 15 minutes. not to mention that half of the tape is previews for other items!!!!"
1,Baby Einstein Neighborhood Animals,My 7 month daughter did not like this video. It would not hold her attention and I was very disappointed. I thought that the music was annoying (worse than Barney) ....
5,Beware: Video release date not the original release date,"I purchased this for a gift thinking it was a new item because of the technical information:Release Information:Studio: Buena VistaVideo Release Date: August 5, 2003But this was actually released much earlier in a different form evidently, and my recipient already had it."
5,Baby Intrigue 101!,Our son has been watching Baby Einstein videos since he was about 3 months old. He has always been especially interested in the Neighborhood Animals DVD. It is well organized and easy to discuss the animals with him as he watches it. He is 8 months old now and still loves it. I highly recommend it!
5,Safe Seat for Sure,"We didn't get this pattern, cause it was very boring, dark navy blue, blah. But we did get this safe seat in the Legacy pattern which a is a lovely brown, light blue, yellow plaid print. Great for a Boy or a Girl, but probably best for a boy. Check it out in the Legacy print.As for how long the infant seat is good for, our son is 1 year and 23 pounds and probably 30 inches and he still fits nicely into this safe seat. We did have to remove something from the underneath to be able to adjust the strps cause they were getting tight. The store where we bought it, Rockridge Kids in Oakland helped us remove it to make more length in the shoulder straps and now we've got probably another 6 months in the seat which will bring us to 1 year and a half. So it's a good long use for an infant seat. I'd definitely go with a Safe Seat over a snug ride."
4,"would have been perfect, but my copy was misproduced.","I have a strong background in physics, and I've always been a great lover of science popularization books. I do like the way that this book is written.But the publisher botched the production! My copy was missing pages 9 to 42, therefore all of chapter two was gone.Maybe its best to wait for the second printing to be sure this doesn't happen to you..."
3,ABBA...THE FRUIT SALAD,"highly anticipating this recent release , and beeing an avid ABBA fan , i was not thoroughly satisfied.1979 was TEN YEARS AFTER 1969 - yet this is NO WOODSTOCK! production and sound...well...suck!storyline is idiotic and breaks the picking of the musical enjoyment.a concert footage only would have earned my review a star higher.why show only the end of FERNANDO ? and why such low-fi on the classiest - MAMA MIA?other than that , there are some joyous monents on stage , like DANCING QUEEN.if Lasse can come home and re edit this mishmash we will all thank him very much."
4,Purely Accidental,"I saw this movie purely accidental. The group ABBA, although a big hit in Europe and Australia, was not known in the Philippines when this film came out. Our music at that time came basically from the U.S.A. In fact, the movie was just a filler for 3 days in a singular theater. I had an hour to waste while waiting for my next appointment. I decided to go to the almost-empty theater to rest in an air-conditioned place. Boy, this was the first time I heard them and I was hooked! I ended up enjoying a good movie, but I was almost an hour late for my appointment. Ever since, I""ve been an avid ABBA fan and have collected all their CDs."
4,It's the real deal this time!!!,"Just wanted to let everyone know that the movie's release is for real this time. Saw it at Walmart (for under $10 no less) and can't wait to watch it.Have seen the movie several times, most recently on TCM, and while it's not great art, it is an enjoyable docudrama tracing a dj's attempts to interview ABBA during their 1977 tour of Australia. Agnetha gets off some great one-liners related to her backside and the supposedly enhanced sound and picture should make the concert footage a real treat."
3,Surprised this won a Pulitzer Prize,"Perhaps it was just my frame of mind, but I found this book a disappointment. I'll admit that it's well written, but I had to MAKE myself finish the book. Am surprised it won a Pulitzer Prize."
2,Good...but yucka,"Lurie does very well in writing. Her usage of detail and description is to be complimented. Both characters (Vinnie and Fred) see England as very depressing and grey, but this kind of adds a humorous twist. Unfortunately, Lurie loads her novel with explicit conversations and thoughts of sex. Her characters are practically obsessed with it or certainly overly absorbed with it. Stay away from this book if you'd like your mind to remain clean. I had to stop reading it because it physically made me ill."
5,"A ""great read"".","I really enjoyed this work, and look forward to reading others by Ms. Lurie. The author captures, in a gentle way, the nuances of personal thoughts and human interaction.For me, there was only one weakness in this work. Ms. Laurie appears to have a misconception of men's feelings, particularly as they relate to women. On occasion, it appeared that one of the mechanisms the author uses to differentiate men from women is to have her male characters use vulgarity somewhat gratuitously. Although, in general, this work had less vulgarity than many others. Her representation of the inner thoughts of her male characters did not ring true, at least to this male reader.None-the-less, this is a marvelous work that holds your interest, leads you to care about, and feel you know, its main character Vinnie Miner, and is a hard book to put down.Highly recommended as an ""outstanding read"". The Pulitzer committee got it right!"
5,Meets Expectations!,"I'm building a 2-story addition, with a basement, onto my home and wanted to set up 6 sets of speakers exclusive from my main 7.1 receiver's powered speakers through the receiver's Zone 2. I purchased 3 Amp 200's to have one amp for each two sets of speakers, with an independent volume for each set, and it sounds great! I bridged the amps through the Line 2 In then Out and it works perfectly. At a price below $200 each amp this is a no brainer for anyone looking to go multi-room. Highly recommended and I'll let you know how things go later regarding reliability. M"
2,Not what I expected,Quite small and not very adjustable. I will be returning this item today. It looked sort of cheap and had some strings coming off up close.
2,Don't understand the size...,"The description says that this hat is an one size fit all type of hat and fits up to XL.I wear S/M sized hats, that saying, Fedoras and other Military hats. This hat however didn't fit on my head. It looked like only a kid could wear it.Not even my sister who has a smaller head could wear it.The product, however, has a nice quality, way better compared to my other Military that is pretty worn out.So I don't know if it's the product that I received that came ""very"" small or if that's the size that it is supposed to have."
2,It was too big,"The size was way too big for a normal sized head person. Also It was crooked. Never had a hat that looked crooked on my head before.Also I tried returning it, it did not even give me a return label or any information on where I should return it.. So I just sent it back to whichever address it came from. Hopefully the money comes in some day."
3,The bonus features (Easter Eggs) were hard to control!,"The movie was OK, seen it a million times. What really chafed me was that the bonus features were not easy to select. I couldn't see the cursor to make my selection, so I had to push my remote until my selection was made. Poor design!"
2,Not Funny,"For some reason, I was looking forward to watching this movie. But, ultimately the jokes fell flat. The storyline failed to intrigue and was cliche.I've never before found Mila Kunis attractive. But, in this movie, wow. She is the only thing that makes this remotely worth watching.Please do not waste an hour and a half of your life on this film."
3,worth your time,"funny spots, sweet spots. this is not destined to be a movie classic but certainly worth the time watching."
1,Didn't Laugh Once,"I love comedies. This movie is so unfunny that the writer, director and producer should be sued for false advertising. I bought this movie used for $5 at Blockbuster. That was too much money for this movie.I watched this painfully uneventful movie from start to finish. It was devoid of humor.However, this movie has two things that make it worthwhile:1. Mila Kunis2. A Hawaiian version of the song ""Nothing Compares 2 U""The ""Who can be the loudest in bed"" scene was not funny at all. That scene looked as if it was ripped off from ""The Cooler."" By the way, ""The Cooler"" is a great drama with a few bits of genuine comedy. The bedroom scene was much funnier (and original) in ""The Cooler.""There are so many comedies out there that really are comedies. Please watch one of them instead. (Hint: it is NOT a funny movie if the name ""Judd Apatow"" appears in any of the credits.)"
1,SAVE your money for something worth while!,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. There were a few humorous parts, but not enough to make this film worth while. It is mainly a bunch of people walking around nude and having sex. If you like porn, this may be the movie for you. However, if you are more conservative, DO NOT rent this! The 4 star rating is deceiving!"
5,Hilarity,This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! The special features are hilarious as well. 100% would recommend!
4,as if you would forget Sarah Marshall,"..she's flippin gorgeous!! How did a fat lump like him get these magic chicks? It gives hope to us fellow fat lumps everywhere! What, it isnt true you tells me?Russell Brand is hilarious just being himself, he probably didnt even have a script, just turned up and joined in. Anyway, liked Knocked Up and Superbad and all of those, consistently amusing and will be added to my DVD collection forthwith.PS - Forgive the lack of apostrophes, I am giving them up for the new year."
2,"Don't usually go to extremes on reviews, but I thought it was awful","In order to give some context, I thought The Hangover and Old School were hilarious, but this thing was terrible. They seemed to have followed the philosophy that if you can't come up with real humor, substitute vulgarity into that gaping hole. So that's what they did. I very rarely give below 2 stars or above 4 but this film was pushing it to get a one."
5,Very funny,"A Quad Star power house in Comedy. I have seen the TV version many times, just ordered the unrated version, look it up on IMDb for more information."
1,Forgetting Digital Copy,"I really like this movie and was looking forward to the digital copy for my iPad. The package arrived without the insert that contains the activation code, so no digital copy. I went to the Universal Studios support website and sent in a request for support, and got no response. I returned the defective copy to Amazon, got a replacement very quickly (thank you, Amazon support!), and the replacement was identical - no insert, no activation code - no digital copy!! I went to the web and found a large number of posts from people that had the exact same experience. It look like Universal is having big-time quality control issues.Forgetting Sarah Marshall [Blu-ray]"
4,Help us get rid of the matthew good band,"This is it. The end of the road for one of my most beloved bands. Though many people have said that the MGB saga ended in a whimper instead of bang, I must disagree. I feel that ""The audio of being"" was a great album for them to end on. ""Advertising On Police Cars"" ""Carmelina"" ""Tropli"" and ""Fall of Man"" are great stand out tracks. During the recording of ""The Audio of Being"" nerves where wearing thin between Matt and Dave and you can hear in some of the tracks like ""Anti-pop"" and ""Truffle Pigs"" that maybe they weren't giving it their all. Though that is a factor, ""The audio of Being"" is still a worthy installment to MGB's reassume. Even though Matthew Good himself denounces it.If you you're a fan of MGB you should pick this up. In a way we owe it to them to pick it up. It should be our way of bidding such a talented band a fond and heartfelt fairwell."
5,Rush - a must for anyone who enjoys progressive art,It's hard to state the excellence of this video after reading the reviews. I've owned this video since it's inception and 10 years later it's still my favorite. I wish their video collection was reissued on DVD.
3,An unfaithful video display of excellent audio...,"The musicianship, the talent, the gift is there; however, bad filming and editing negatively contribute to the brilliance a Rush. Nonetheless, Rush fans must have this video, for it contains different versions of the songs in the album."
5,A Magnificent Master Piece !!,"This is Classic CeCe at full throttleWow what can I say,I have been a CeCe Fan ever sinceher 1998 ""Everlasting Love"" Album and I was so happythat she included it with the ""Throne Room Concert""it is a personal song for me,one of my favorits.But I love all of her albums,I have them all even herfirst album ""Alone In His Presence"".CeCe really bringsthe worship experience to you,you know the presenceof the Lord is there and you know that CeCe is one ofhis real children and you get that feelin while witnessingthis wonderful worship experience,the heavens where allover ""The Throne Room"".Thank you CeCe,you were awesomewhen you came to Norfolk,Va at the Ted Constant CenterMay of last year,my sister and I will never forget it.If you are a true CeCe Winans fan,this is a must have.God Bless,"
5,This is the xylophone you want to buy.,"Does not disappoint. Great little xylophone for a decent price. Sturdy. Looks and sounds good. If you are worried that this is a cheap piece of $#, like I was, then do not worry...it's not."
5,"Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms!",I use this book quite a bit for rhythm reading in my younger grades. It's a nice reference book and the students do very well with the rhythms.
4,BABY BEETHOVEN,"EXCELLENT ENTERTAINMENT FOR YOU LITTLE ONE. IF YOU WANT ANOTHER VIDEO/DVD THAT IS A LITTLE MORE STIMULATING AND WITH GREAT MUSIC TRY ""LOTS TO LEARN - NATURE"". IT'S NEW AND NOT AS REPETITIVE AS THE ""BABY BEETHOVEN"" SERIES."
2,Breaks into tears???,"I have a one year old who LOVES the baby Einstein DVDs. We have Mozart, Bach and Newtown and he loves them all.Then I bought Baby Beethoven.For whatever reason my son will start crying the minute the first scene begins? I have no idea why, but for whatever reason he is frightened out of his wits when this DVD starts playing. I've tried several times to play the DVD but it always turns out the same way. Uncontrollably crying.So just be aware when and if you purchase this DVD. It could bring you kid to tears."
3,Baby Einstein Symphony of Fun,The Disk was used but was in good condition. The baby I purchased the DVD for is loving it.
1,disappointed,"The sound quality was awful. The music sounded tinny and full of static. The pictures were not much different from other videos in this series. Unfortunately, I didn't keep the sales receipt."
3,Just okay,I heard people rave about these dvd's. I bought 25 of them and my son didnt give them 2 seconds of his time. I wasnt impressed with the quality. I guess whether your child likes them or not will depend on if they are a tv watcher or not.
1,"OK video, terrible sound quality","I have 8-month old triplets who love to watch Baby Mozart and Baby Bach each afternoon before bed. Thinking it would be good to expand our collection, I ordered Baby Beethoven (VHS) and was very disappointed to discover the sound quality was horrendous - very distorted, crackles, etc. The images look great ... but the whole point of the tape is the music with images. Just beware if you are considering this purchase. The Baby Einstein ads in the beginning of the tape are annoying too - very commercial."
4,Another goodie by Turow,"I've been a fan of Scott Turow since he burst on the lawyerly writing scene with Presumed Innocent, which actually is still my favorite of his several books. Reversible Errors is his 6th, and it deals with the myriad issues surrounding the death penalty, and especially how it relates to defendants who are perhaps retarded or otherwise mentally impaired. There are hints of prejudicial testimony, collusion of lawyers involved in the original trial, bribery, legal secrets, and a dying con who muddies the waters with deathbed testimony that may or may not be self-serving.Convoluted, conflicted, controversial, compelling. It's a good one."
3,A Little Hard to Get Through,"With an interesting basis for a curvy storyline, Scott Turow does a great job creating a diverse array of characters and personal backstories. The imbecile Rommy Gandolph is greatly contrasted by the cunning and clever Erdai family members and guys on the Force. The characters are what truly makes the story incredible. Although, after all is said and done, the characters are wholly depressing!But the twists and turns of the plot, along with the occasionally overdrawn and minutely detailed legalities mire the story in depth. It can be very difficult to get through at some points without a dire need for a nap. Plainly: it gets boring. But eventually, a new drug or legal technicality or dirty personal history will rear its ugly head and you'll be dying to know how and when it will play into the case.It was my first Turow novel and probably my last."
1,Ugh!!,"Well, in my many long years of reading almost any book, I have seldom found one I just couldn't get interested in. This was slow, tedious and difficult to follow. I finally started jumping 50-75 pages at a time and couldn't even tell I had jumped!! Good luck."
1,Very disappointing,"Other than Creature Comforts and Balance the items in this collection are instantly forgettable. This is definitely NOT the world's greatest animation - far from it. I watched many Canadian Film Board animations a long time ago when I was a child, and I still remember being impressed by their creativity and originality. That isn't reflected in this DVD.Also, with a title of The World's Greatest Animation, I'd expect maybe just one piece from a music video or a TV commercial, something technologically dazzling, something that makes you go wow and call someone else into the room to see it, or maybe some internet-available stuff like L'Amour by Don Hertzfeldt or Video Computer System by Golden Shower. What I got instead was mostly tedious, unimpressive and uninspiring cartoons.I'd suggest you don't waste your money on this one."
4,"""Last Seder"" is the best","I enjoyed all the plays in this anthology; it was a tapestry, with each playwright contributing to the richness of the pattern and texture of the whole. But if I had to pick the best, I must say that the last play, ""The Last Seder"" by Jennifer Maisel, would win hands down. It had that spark, walking that fine line between laughter and tears, and her voice is so strong and clear. One of the best plays I've ever read, and one I'd just love to see a production of someday. Fine work."
3,"No support, none!","To be honest, I actually like the product. Great sound, nice features, fairly easy to use, however this unit does seem to be a little ""buggy"", some of the features dont work as explained in the users guide. If I were to do it over again I may have gone with the ipod. This company (archos) has what seems to be a 4 person operation here in the US. I called to order the multi voltage adapter for use in europe, and the representative I spoke to had no clue what this was. After being put on hold for another 10 minutes she came back with a little more understanding, but no part number. I also have a fairly simple technical question and left an e-mail 1 week ago with no reply. I've given up. If you want to save money and are willing to take a chance on what is really a nice product than this is for you, just understand that once you buy it you are on your own!Oh ya, the batteries only last about 3-4 hours, the literature states up to 12 hours."
1,Battery Runs Out Very Quickly,"Would you buy a car that can only drive for 5 miles before running out of petrol ? If yes then this gadget is for you.Functions are great but it runs of juice unbeleivably quickly. I charged the battery fully, copied a bunch of files over and next time I switched the thing on... battery empty. Happens over and over again.I've got a 20 GB Creative Zen jukebox which I play all week on holiday on one charge. It can also play WMA files as well and is all round fab.I have relegated my Archos to using as a back up hard drive for my important PC files.I suggest you do not buy an archos.If you are thinking of buying one, at least try them out by sending a query to the helpdesk and see if you get a reply.... think that may be enough to give you a clear idea of what you are (not) getting for your money.PG"
5,Excellent New Group,"I loved everything about this CD, from the cover to all of the songs. Keep up the great work. I look forward to new tunes."
2,Before BFS hit their groove,"I started listening to Bowling For Soup with their later albums. When I listened to this one, I was sorely disappointed. It doesn't match the style of the later albums at all. They sound like a knockoff of an early Green Day album. The only track on the CD that is really good is Belgium, which can be found on several of their other albums, so you don't need to buy this one to get it.If you want to hear something that sounds like a Green Day album, buy a Green Day album. If you want to hear something that sounds like Bowling For Soup, buy a BFS album other than this one."
5,wow,Wow finally a good mainstream punk type cd...it has more hard rock in it and there not that much pop elements as there were in all killer no filler which was a horrible album but this is a great cd...i reccomend it for anyone even if u dont like the mainstream pop/punk stuff...its great.
1,not new...not good,"sum 41 is the poster child for the flavor of the month, reinvent the wheel and sell it as an underinflated firestone, music industry. the ""not new"" reviewer got it right. a much much better and more productive form (musically, emotionally and politically) of this music was made during the late 70's to the mid to late 80's. Even a few bands trickled into the early 90's. listen, do yourself (and everyone else) a favor: check out anything on the following record labels instead of blink 41: taang, alternative tentacles, touch and go, dischord or triple X. you might actually feel something real, instead of mindlessly nodding to the money-grubbing worthless, overdone, contrived spew of sum 41. who knows, you might learn something, too."
2,It's missing the big hits!,"I was mislead by my evil friend Brian. He told me that this album had all their biggest hits on it, which is far from true. I was looking for the album with ""All the Small Things"" and ""What's My Age Again?"", but I can't find them anywhere. I know that those are done by Sum 41, cuz my friend Bill told me so. If you can help me out with this, email me here: bobstone1357@yahoo.com"

1,"More HARDCORE punk from Sum 41, DUDE!!","Man, dude, i have been waiting for this CD to come out. It's FINALLY here!! The last CD was one of the best because it is approved by the God of punk, CARSON DALY! Even though i wanted the singer to rap more often, this CD is STILL awesome. It still is great, kicking punk that is mainstream to the core! The dude at the CD store said I should go listen to some ""Ramoans"" or Clash instead. Well, both of those bands are stupid... groups with [stupid] lyrics, just like Black flag, Pennywise, and Dead Kennedys. All that stuff scares me. Sk8 on down to the record store and buy this NOW! PUNK OUT!"
5,wonderful!,"this is a really good album. much better than the first, with more appealing chourses and a more of a punk sound! their new sound is very ear catching. i totally recommend you go and buy this album! and the sweet bonus dvd makes it even that much better."
5,WOW!,This was the first thing i've said after listened to this new cd. It's less commercial than the others and that's what suprised me the most. If you got money to spend just buy that cd! You wont regret it.
1,EDITED,"I like this album, and I knew that before I bought it here. I'm not going to post some amateur review of the music, I just wanted it to be known that Amazon's MP3 download of this album is EDITED. F'ing stupid."
4,I agree with Mortimer,"I agree with Mortimer 100%...Sum 41 isn't punk it's more rock then punk.There are not my favorite band but i still think they do good jobs on their cd's,i don't like all their songs but i would never consiter them punky."
5,I wish I could rate it 10 stars!!!,"Wow. This album is amazing. It is just that good punk rock you wish u could listen all the time. IT's the kind of music u listen to when ur really hyper and u want to run around the house. And who the hell said they were only immature teens? They are songs in there that talk about serious topics like HIV and war. Not about 'Skateboarding and getting dumped' .... Still waiting is great, i bet it'll win all sorts of awards. The video is so funny. I love Sum41. And not because They are hot. I love there music and there funny crazy personality."
4,SUM41,"If your not a Sum41 fan go buy the Cd and after you listen to the new tracks you will be.As usual Sum's songs are upbeat and fun to listen to. If you think they're just another Group of guys that are blink wannabe's your wrong. Sum41 is rock'n on the MTV hit Show TRL. With their song ""Still waiting"" its obvious people can't get enough of them. The guys keep it real as JLo would say with their humor and practical jokes. So my advice is go get the new SUM41 Cd ""Does This Look Infected"" or you haven't really Lived yet."
5,Pop punk my @$$!,"Anyone who isn't a mainstream music fan probably told you not to buy this, and/or said Som41 is just a Blink182 ripoff. But I've had this CD since it came out and it has really grown on me. If you're the average Good Charlotte (post-self-titled) or Avril Lavigne fan this CD isn't for you. In my opinion Sum41 has always been 33% Metallica, 33% Iron Maiden, and 33% NOFX. With all due respect to NOFX, which are incredible, this CD is about 45% Metallica, and 45% Maiden. But enough babbling, if you are a Punk OR Metal fan of any generation, you'll love this CD."
4,A Modern Anthemic Classic,"Smart, angst-ridden, sarcastic, driven, quality, powerful, snarly and purely entertaining. Right up there with Dookie in terms of breakthrough value. Brilliant that they paid homage to all their juvenile influences, be it metal, punk, hiphop or other. It shows great maturity and flexibility. I'd rate it up there with early top notch NOFX with their flecks of reggae and classic stadium rock. Definitely one of the top dozen punk induced creations of the past couple decades. KILL ALL THE WHITE MAN! C.F.N."
5,Is it really Infected??,"About 3 years ago, i was introduced to Sum 41. I purchased ""All Killer No Filler"" and from then on, there my #1 band. There first album, ""Half Hour of Power"" is o.k. But this album, it is the best one ever!! i'm serious. the dvd is ""Kick ass"" as Deryck would say. But the cd has the best guitar riffs and awesome lyrics you can't help but sing out loud. especially their first single, ""Still Waiting"" it's awesome!!! ""The Hell Song"" is my favorite song on the album. I put this album on and just put it on CD repeat 'cause all the songs are so good. If you're just getting into sum 41, buy this album because this is their best work yet!!"
5,better the the others,"this album is great. its got that mix everyone loves, that jumpy punk thing and a little bit of rock too. theres some great new songs on there and the dvd is so funny. this is not a waste of money everyone go buy it!"
5,This CD Rocks!,"The new Sum 41 cd, Does This Look Infected is awesome. It has lyrics that hold true to the teen generation today and the music just rocks. In fact its all I have been listening to lately. I would reccomend this cd to any one and if you don't have it yet WHY NOT! I strongly urgre you to get this cd."
5,"A must buy cd(sum 41, does this look infected)","Yo, this cd is sweet, everyone should have a copy of it, it comes with a dvd that is funnier than anythying. GO BUY ONE NOW.-nick"
4,Good Sophmore Album,"I liked ""All Killer No Filler"", ""Does This Look Infected"" is a great follow up. Unlike other bands that have been on MTV, Sum 41 has continued to keep playing the same way, not selling out. The CD is definately worth buying."
2,"this song is ok, and i resold the cd","sorry everyone but i think kelly wants to be Christina Aguilerashe tries to sound like her, dress like her, she even tittled one of her songs just like one of Christinas songs from her stripped cd. and she screams in her songs...they may share a recod label but, but there is only one Christina!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't wait to buy her CD in spring of 2006............."
1,Kolobos,"When first viewing this film, i thought that it was a copy of the Blair Witch Project due to the first person camera views. After about 10 minutes this changes to a third party view after the main cast get to the house, this is where the film goes down hill and becomes a horror to watch not that it was scary but because of the poor acting and special FX, even so there were a few funny moments."
1,A Poor Teaching Tool,"I ordered this book because I want to learn to draw cats. Well, not just cats, but MY cat. He is such a character! How can I render his ""I am invisible now"" stance? Or his, ""Get out of my chair"" glare?This book teaches by using sketches, only. There is no written content. In addition, the sketches are somewhat accomplished, which may be a drawback that makes written instruction necessary, in my opinion. Hence, the ""Step-by Step"" title is misleading. Simplification is important to the process of drawing. This book does not provide that."
3,good introduction,"This is a good book for getting into the nitty-gritty of astrophysics. It has all the information and formulas that you'll need to understand the basic and intermediate levels of astrophysics. It reminds though of my SR-71 pilot's manual that I bought 15 years ago. It's a republication of copied pictures. The photos, for the vast majority, are black and white. This is fine for someone who wants the book the supplement their astronomy class(as I did), but doesn't make it for a coffee-table book to look at the pictures of the amazing universe. Get it for the information, not the visual stimulus. The information is superb, but the soft cover and the grainy, copied pictures leave it with 3 stars."
1,we loved the rest of the series but...,"Siince my grandson adores all his other Baby Einstein videos, I couldnt wait to get this one for him. When we put the video on, he watched it for some time and then suddenly began crying and shaking. Our first thought was that he was ill. A few days later we tried it again and he had the same response...it seemed to occur when one of the birds came on. While not understanding his reaction, we decided to give it to a friend with a baby, explaing to her that for some reason he didnt like this one. Her baby reacted in the same way. Curious if anyone else has observed strange reaction"
4,"Good, but not as good as Neighborhood Animals","My son (almost 1) loves all the Baby Einstein videos, but this one has not yet completely captured his attention. I think they did a better job with the Neighborhood animals video - the music in this one is a little less engaging and the whole video has a slightly lethargic feel to it. Not quite up to the high standards they have set."
4,Still Good Entertainment,"My triplet 2 year olds love watching the animals-- and this video does keep them entertained while seeing and learning about animals. The quality of the video, however, is not as good as some of the others of Baby Einstein. The sound quality seems to be especially poor (at least on my tape)."
1,An Embarrassment,"Ackroyd is a bad scholar, a bad thinker and a bad stylist. He should never have attempted a biography of Shakespeare. The best and kindest thing one can do to this rubbish is not read it."
2,needed more work,"The writer is obviously a serious poker player, but the book is not well-organized. The result isn't very reader-friendly. I'd be very eager to see a reworked second edition, though."
5,Legend of Sasquatch,"It is adorable! I do daycare and I have not met a kid who doesn't love it. Cute music, too!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this video since my 13-month old son absolutely loved the 2 other Baby Einstein videos we have. I also liked the idea of this one having a Christmas theme. Well don't waste your money...this video is terrible! After watching it twice with my son, it doesn't hold his interest at all like the others. It is poorly produced and just seems like something that was put together quickly just to make some quick cash during the holidays. The music selection is terrible (very slow and mundane) and the pictures and video are very, very generic.If you must have this video for your child, check out E-bay first. I'll be selling mine really cheap!"
3,not as entertaining,"My seven month old son loves the ""Baby Mozart"" video. I thought for sure ""Baby Santa's Music Box"" would entertain him. I was surprised to find that ""Baby Santa's Music Box"" barely held his attention while the ""Baby Mozart"" video holds his attention the entire 27+ minutes. I found the characters adorable, but they didn't pass the test for my son!"
1,not as good as the rest,I am glad I didn't buy this as my first Baby Einstein movie because i would have never bought another one again. My son loves the rest of them but this one was just not well done at all.
1,Very Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of the Baby Einstein series. My nine month old son has been captivated by Baby Mozart and Baby Bach since he was about 3 months old and more recently, by Baby Van Gogh. I was really looking forward to the Baby Santa video, but was SO disappointed when it arrived! My son (who gets excited as soon as he sees the copyright notice!) watched for about 3 minutes and then crawled away. I, too, found it very boring. The problem seems to be the music. It is the very lively music that most keeps his attention, but this is completely lacking in this video. The music is slow and flat, and doesn't ""go"" with the pictures as is the case in the other videos. You get the sense from watching this video that it was done in a hurry, perhaps to get it out for the holiday season. While I recommend the other videos to every parent I know, I have to say this one is just a waste of money."
2,Not the best...,This video wasn't the best BE video-seemed to be more appropriate for chilren 6 to 12 months-not what I have come to expect from BE-will not be keeping this one-yard sale!
4,Very good product,"The only reason I did not give the cover five stars is the fit. I am not a rider and so I had to depend on the description of bikes to determine the size. With saddle bags and a windshield, the cover does not come down as far as the picture shows but the friend who received it as a gift loves it. The windshield protection inside, the elastic at the bottom, and the heat protection allowing him to cover his bike after five minutes of cooling are the things he raves about."
4,Very good book I would have liked to read with my class,"This is another book I think my class would have liked and wish I could have read with them. I have to compliment the author on the first chapter of the book--we are introduced to the as-yet-nameless main character. Immediately the reader feels both pity and admiration for the boy who has no family, name or anyone to care for him. However, through the force of his own wits and will survives traveling across the country assisting in harvesting. Just as a minor character, the first we know of to care for the boy, is about to give him a name...the unexpected happens (I won't ruin it). The first chapter will hook the young reader (or in this case, the older reader), and lead him to a sheepherding ranch in Montana where the book turns to themes of family, responsibility, forgiveness and persistance. I would recommend it for teachers, parents and young adults."
3,Fun but not really.,"I liked this story, yes I did but some parts are unrealistic.I first read this story for book report and I thought it was O.K."
4,Cute lil' bath tub read...but dont take everything seriously!,"I loved this book when I first found it a couple of years back. Its encouraging and soothing to any soul who is yearning to feel and live fabulously..but I was 16...now that im 21 I can still respect and praise some of the advice from this book for instance, it suggest that you forget all those mean things people said about you and work your stuff! It pushes reading and watching Black classics and lets you know that you can be charming, fun and delightful..no one likes a nasty, abbrasive attitude. There is just one thing that makes this book silly..it suggest that you use your last dime to buy material items such as bags and stuff..totally pre-recession advice..other than that it a cute book..."
1,DO NOT BUY - CHEAP!,"After the fourth attempt and still no success, this product is absolutely terrible. As other reviews have stated, if your child can not sit patiently with his/her hand/foot in in mold, then this will be a waste. It took over a minute for the mold to dry... little toddlers and babies cannot sit still. While they are sleeping? Are they serious? My 21 month old is a light sleeper, as soon as I picked up her hand she new! What a incredible waste of time and money!!!"
1,Money down the drain,"NOT happy with this one - my three year old son and I tried to make the imprint of his hands in the gel mold this evening and it was nothing but a HUGE mess. Instructions tell you to immediately put their hands/feet in the gel mold so it can form around their hand. Sounded simple enough except for the fact that we sat there waiting and waiting with NO drying. I can't blame my son, he got impatient with it and started sliding his hand and crinkling his fingers and all we had left was a slimy hand and a few dried pieces of gel in the mold. I think that if we had waited for the gel to dry more it would have been better but you only have one chance to get it right and if you follow the directions it will be botched.One Mothers Day present down the drain. Sadly - it was the only one, I am VERY disappointed in this product."
2,Kinda hard and incovenient for making a babies hand or footprint.,Directions say that you have to be very quick at making the hand print with the gel. Many times it isn't always convient to make any baby do something fast. I wouldn't reccomend doing this hand print when making prints for babies.
1,Great book. Kindle version full of errors.,"This is a great book for any mathematical library. The print edition is very readable and the examples are helpful. I purchased the kindle version and quickly found several problems with the mathematical typesetting in the book. When I compared the kindle version to the print version formulas were often missing symbols including summations, subtraction signs, and parenthesis. This made many of the equations and expressions unreadable. While most of the typesetting was fine there were enough errors that I chose to return the kindle book for a refund. I informed amazon customer service and they appear to be working on the problem because as of this writing the kindle book is no longer available for purchase. I am rating one star until the kindle version is fixed. The print version would deserve four or five stars."
5,Very comfortable and dependable,"I must prop my reconstructed ankle up every night for 8 weeks. By being able to remove the middle wedge, I got the pillow to the perfect height. Also, my leg and foot do not roll off the pillow in the night, and it is elevated and cradled so that my partner doesn't kick my foot as he thrashes around in the night. Also, a neat freak, I love it that I can wash the ""pillow case,"" which is totally secured onto the pillow with a zipper system so that it can not slide off."
2,Baby Newton - What a Disapointment!,"Baby Newton is definately a departure from the normal Baby Einstein videos. Whoever said change was good didnt watch this video! The animation, which is not in any of the other Baby Einstein videos, stinks. The animated clown is especially awful and borders on scary looking. The I Know My Shapes song is awful they should have stayed with the classical music as background to the video. My son who usually loves the videos lost interest right away in this one. I cant stand watching it with him either, so its a good thing he didnt like it. Definately dont buy this video if you are a fan of the other and are excpecting more of the same!"
1,Makes my baby CRY!!!,"I don't know what it is but as soon as this video starts, turns digital and there are some crayons in a box which peak out with their little eyes, my baby bursts into hysterical tears. He is genuinely terrified. It's a mystery. He got it for his first birthday and I have tried is several times over the past 7 months and each time it's the same reaction. I'm giving it away, but part of me is afraid of terrifying some other poor unexpecting soul. I don't think he's just disappointed in the poor quality. He's truly upset. So am I. What's up with that? It makes me curious if this happens to any other baby. All the other videos we've seen of this series are great. Especially the first ones, and the animal ones."
2,Too Much Disney,"Julie Clark has allowed Disney's style to overpower her original concept. The music is loud and dopey, the crayon character is frightening and the real children's faces are missing..."
1,Not for infants!,"We have ten of the Baby Einstein DVDs ang generally love them, but this one scares my 5 mo. old daughter. We have tried it four different times and it makes her cry without fail. The computer generated crayons and clown (especially in 3-D) freak her out. This one is for older babies."
2,"Baby Newton - Very ""Un-Einstein"" like",This Baby Einstein differs greatly from all the other Baby Einstein DVDs that we own. I also like it the least. The video had few puppets and only 2 babies in it. It was filled with cheesy animation of crayons and a clown which both added little to the video. I just finished watching the counting video and I can't understand why they didn't to the shape video similiar to that. I would not recommend this video!
1,"My least favorite, but kids like some of it.","I bought this without checking the reviews and regret it. As many people have commented, this is very different from the other Baby Einstein videos. There is WAY too much computer animation and are very few images of shapes. The photos they do have of shapes are vague, e.g. walking suitcases for rectangles. I'm sure there are far better examples of rectangles out there! Also, the song is unbelievably annoying. I prefer the classical music of the other BE videos.What drives me most crazy about this video is the behavior of the puppets. The lion has crayons in his mouth (a habit I'm trying to break my twins of) and the dog gets bowled over by a ton of balls (my kids cry every time this happens).This is a complete bust in my book."
5,My 14 month old LOVES this one,He has other Baby Einstein DVDs and this one is his favorite. He watches the entire DVD start to finish and dances along. He loves the colors and the shapes and the *clown.* He even gets out his shaped blocks while the movie is playing and we stack them up like the video does.
4,"Save it for later, at least 18 months","I showed this video to my daughter when she was a little over a year. She showed no interest in it at all. I popped it back in many months later, when she was about 21 months old, and she absolutely loved it. She watched it over and over, and continually asks to watch it. So, I recommend this video for older children, at least 18 months, not little babies. My only complaint is the sound on the VHS tape. I thought my tape was defective until I read a review by someone else who had the same problem. My advice is to buy the DVD if you can."
3,Not our favorite of the series,"My daughter is 23 months old and we have many of the Baby Einstein products. We love most of them, but this one just doesn't hold her attention like the others. I agree with the reviewers who feel it strays from the Baby Einstein format. She seems to pay more attention to the more traditional ""Einstein"" products with classical music and less animation."
3,Misinformation,"My 1 year old son is mesmerized by Baby Newton. He really enjoys the puppet action, the song about shapes as well as the beautiful pictures set to classical music. However, I am disappointed in the information on Baby Newton. They show 3-dimensional shapes and name them 2-dimensional. For example, they refer to a sphere as a circle. I used to teach second grade before I became a mother and we worked very hard on this concept in class. This is a ""trick"" question on many standarized tests in schools. The test will have a picture of a sphere and ask the student to name it. So many students aren't careful and mark ""circle"" as the answer. I hope to soon replace this video with one that he likes just as well and has correct information. I enjoy the opportunity to get supper ready while he is watching the video."
4,Fast shipping,"Easy ordering, reasonable price, and fast shipping. This is my grandson's favorite video. I realized when I got it that it had different music intro than the one he was used to. He liked the horns in the other version better. I am not sure which is the original. I assumed they were all alike."
5,Love it!!,My grand daughter sat and watched this dvd for about fifteen minutes before she was ready to do something else but the fact that she is 4 and half months that was a long time.I let her play with her toys and finished watching this DVD and I just love the simple simplicity of this DVD it sparks imgination and learning even if a baby doesn't know it.That truly is the key to Baby Einstein products making teaching fun and simple.Bottom line this is another great product from a company that I have grown to love.
4,"What a load of Crap,or is it","Just a load of shouting and bass, Ya lieeeee! Cd's heavy bredgin' but its proper old."
1,A poor effort,"It read like Johnson sat down and wrote this because he needed money. No substantial detail or analysis. It seemed like he wrote this ""off the top of his head."""
3,Napoleon biography,"Pretty good short synopsis of Napoleon's life. Given the number of adulatory biographies on Napoleon, this is a good read if for nothing else to get the opposing Anglo-Saxon view. There was however some biographical errors in the book. Specifically, Johnson confuses Lucien Bonaparte with another brother, Louis Bonaparte. It makes one wonder if there are not other biographical mistakes in the book. All in all, a good read."
3,Not bad,"Stephen Hough performed most of the pieces well here. But there's one movement that I have a hard time getting through every time I listen to it.I think he played the second movement of Piano Concerto no. 2 WAY TOO FAST...! Mendelssohn even titled it ""Adagio, molto sostenuto""... I have absolutely no idea why he decided to play it like another 1st or 3rd movement."
5,Outstanding,"This is an amazing human document. Although fiction, it will not be surprising to hear stories like this from that era. I for one don't believe that german wives and other german civvies were not aware of what was happening in the camps. They just chose to ignore it out of fear or whatever. However that is irrelevant to this review. But if there was one book that somebody asked me about the holocaust to read from an emotional (which is how it should be looked at) and not a statistical(Those big numbers and experiments) sta ndpoint, this will be it."
3,CD Purchase/Shipment,I was confused why I received a used CD for $28 when the original price on the CD was close to half that amount!!
1,rate 1 star for poor sizing; quality appears to be very good,"I ordered a size 8 and size 10. both appear to be the same size and both are way, way much smaller than the sizing chart!!It look like I got a childs 8 or 10 and not a ladies size, so I am very dis-satisified."
3,Not the best in the series,"Our 16 month old son watches this video, but it doesn't interest him in the same way that Baby Van Gogh or Baby Mozart do. What I don't like about it is that it doesn't really do anything to reinforce the words learned. For example, after the poem about the train, one might expect the video to show toy trains. Instead it shows toys that have no relationship to the word/poem. In contrast, the Baby Van Gogh video would introduce a color, then show toys and scenes featuring the same color. My advice is to skip this one and go straight to Baby Van Gogh."
3,good but not up there with You All Look The Same To Me,"Nice effort from Archive, not quite up to the standard set by ""You All Look The Same To Me"" but nonetheless worthwhile for fans of their Massive Attack-meets-Pink Floyd sound."
3,Product needs work,"I have been using Microsoft Money I think as earlier as version 95. I upgraded from 2002, which I liked very much, to 2006 which I'm not too impressed with. The interface gets prettier with each release but at the same time gets more complicated to use. My Money file got corrupted after about one month of use and that really turned me off to this product. I tried switching to Quicken at one point but that was even worse. I guess for now I'm stuck with MS Money until something better comes along."
2,Too many bugs,"I've used MS Money since 1999, I think. Never had a problem until now. I was using 2005 when they made a upgrade available last Mar or Apr. Ever since the upgrade, and continuing with the 2006 version, I cannot use the debt reduction planner. After several hours on the phone with tech support, it seems that I'm the only one who noticed the problem. And of course there is no fix, no plans for a fix -- maybe with the 2007 version. Also, what the heck did they do to the budget feature? I'm at a loss as to what to do, since Money and Quicken seem to be the only programs out there."
1,I wish I had not purchased this DVD.,Some nudity in a horror movie. I ended up fast forwarding a goodly part of the movie and threw the DVD in the wastebasket when I was done.
3,Meh...,"Well, it was definitely not -bad- but it wasn't excellent either. The beginning seemed to come on strong, and this set of songs is alright, but there's nothing new and at times I almost felt bored. It happens to a lot of bands and Curve became no exception. If you had to skip one, this'd be a good bet. If you're starting out, you might want to try an earlier album from them. If you prefer the more electronic sound, go with Come Clean instead."
4,Nothing New but still a great CD,"Its not as if Curve has broken any new ground here but this album is packed almost from start to finish with excellent songs charged with atmospheric guitars, pounding rhythms, and of course Toni Haliday's seductive, hypnotic, mesmerizing vocals. Overall this is a great CD and highly suggest to any fan of Curve. In fact I would have to say its their best overall record. Even though my all time favorite song is off of Cuckoo, track number 5, Unreadable Communication. This is worth owning, in fact I have been listening to it constntly since I bought it. You just cant go wrong with a curve record. As I said it doesnt sound that much different from their material over the last few years but at least they main consistent, and consistently good at that."
2,Good overview for managers lacks tech. detail for technician,"This is a good book for middle management types deciding if they should do EDI. However, it lacks enough detail to help the systems analyst develop and deploy EDI applications."
2,Not your typical Pico,I am struggling to get through this book. Video night & Falling Off The Map this isn't. It's just so.......dry. I am giving it two stars in hopes that it will get better.
1,DONT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR A MONTH,"This is crap after about 9 months. If you dont mind paying 150 for something that doesn't last, go ahead and buy this. BUT TRUST ME. THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP. Yeah, I loved it too after a month, now it is making me want to throw it into the ocean with all of the pain and frustration it has caused me."
5,Terrific Overview,"This lively book provides an overview of the literary achievements and personal life of Charles Dickens. For those Amazon.com customers who, like me, don't know how to approach this writer's vast achievements, I provide this advice from Smiley, who is an intelligent, charming, and enthusiastic biographer: ""But a newcomer to Dickens can do no better than to begin with a novel-my suggestions are David Copperfield, to be followed by Great Expectations, Dombey and Son, A Tale of Two Cities, and Our Mutual Friend, in that order, light, dark, light, dark, light, a wonderful chiaroscuro of Dickens's most characteristic and accessible work."" Bravo for Jane and her fun and concise treatment of an enormous subject!"
2,Easy Steps for Little Feet,"Smiley is a true scholar of Dickens, but this chatty, elementary book is a piece of condescension (or a greedy publisher), and was not immediately useful for my paper."
3,OK Travel Wallet - just OK,"We bought this specifically because it had a cellphone pocket, which my husband needed. Unfortunately, the whole wallet is a bit floppy and cumbersome and he went back to his old (no longer available) wallet. Sorry it didn't work out, but we'll sell it at our next garage sale."
4,Good overview of a variety of topics,"Book provides a good detailed overview of a wide variety of supplements and drugs and their impact on athletes. All findings in the book are backed by scientific fact. Only negative is that it doesn't go into great depth on any one topic, but instead keeps it fairly short and to the point."
4,Another great Depeche Mode album,"I first started listening to Depeche Mode after they released ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"" which by the way is my favorite album. Songs ""In your room"" and ""walking in my shoes"" were the ones to grab my attention. I liked how they combined rock and electronics to create really unique sound with great melodies.""Playing the Angel"" for me is their best album since then, although I liked ""Ultra"" and ""Exciter"" as well.The song I like the most from this album, but it had to grow on me, is ""Damaged people"". I think it has really nice melody and great lyrics. ""John the Revelator"" is the song that stood out the most after I first listened to the album. My other favorites are ""The Sinner In Me"", Suffer Well"", ""Precious"", ""Nothing's Impossible"" and ""The Darkest Star"".I gave the album the rating of 4 since 5 for me would be the albums ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"" and ""Violator""."
4,Best DM album since Alan Wilder left BAND,"I am a HUGE DM fan and have been since 1984, but this new CD PTA has me so excited!!!! The first 6 tracks are all terrific. Really strong opening to a really good offering. The last half of the album is a bit slow and dark, but LILLIAN is interesting. I really love SUFFER WELL, John the Revelator, A Pain that I am use to, and PRECIOUS! Looking forward to Nov. 5th in ATLANTA."
5,"A pleasant surprise, after their disappointing mid-late 90's stuff","I have been a fan since the beginning. I put up with them during, SOFAD (gospel vocals should NOT be on a DM record), Exciter and Ultra. I went to their shows and was contentlistening to the old songs praying, they would one day return to their glory.Well I wasn't expecting too much when I heard they were coming out with a new record last year. I LOVED IT!!! They have returned back to their dark wonderful glory!! Daves vocals make a girl happy! I also was amazed at what a great writing job Dave did with his 3 songs. Now I am looking forward to another. A great moody, sexy record!!"
4,Damaged Mode... ?,"Still DM ,but I think the best days are behind them for good.After great ""Ultra"" and somehow disappointing ""Exciter"" new album seems to follow strange and dangerous path.To all hardcore five star fans:-C'mon guys this album ain't deserve five stars and you know this well.I have been hardcore DM fan like you since 1982,collecting all bootlegs and remixes and I really miss old /read-""young""/ Depeche Mode.I was lucky to meet Martin Gore in June in NYC and talk a while about new album-it was something for me....,But I have to admit I'm a little disappointed & nervous about our beloved DM future.Four stars-Out of respect."
2,Will never be the same...,"I am 35, father of two who was a die hard DM fan in the 80's. What a wonderful ride that was! Then they changed after the ""Violator"". Started exploring some weird sounds a lot of noise but no catchy tunes. This album is one of them. Precious is a good song, reminds me ""Enjoy the Silence"" but not a song that I would wanna listen over and over again. Lilian is a catchy tune but again it will never be a hit.They say a band should adapt to new times and generations (i.e Rolling Stones). Call me boring or old fashioned but never wanted DM change or explore new sounds. I think if they stuck with their original new wave style they would have sold more records thanks to their loyal fans. I buy every new DM album anyway with some hope that they would take me back to those days again, even though I know it will never be the same..."
4,Interesting new album,"I'm still not sure where to put this album in the heirarchy of depeche mode albums, but initial impressions are favorable. I'm not a big fan of the loud jarring bit at the beginning of the second track, but other than that blemish (and the fact I think my cd is a badly pressed copy so there are 'skips' in two songs) I think this was a worthwhile purchsase."
5,DM NEW CD PLAYING THE ANGEL - A MUST BUY,"I will be very honest with you this Depeche Mode CD just ROCKS!!!is that simple go and get your copy today you wont regret.these guys are finally BACK.This album will be a big hit for DM fans, I cant wait to see themon the road. WELCOME BACK!!!"
5,another brilliant recording...,"i've exhausted myself in an attempt to dispelsome of the negative reviews of this album...then, i realized i've been doing damage control ever since violator came out..so, i'm done with it.this is another brilliant recording from depeche mode...if you're already a fan, embrace it.if not, that's just unfortunate."
2,Lost the Angle,Having grown up in the 80's listening to bands like Depeche Mode I was Excited to hear their latest. Im dissapointed to say this cd sounds sad and old like the bands picture.If you are unsure of what to buy of them I would recomend 'Speak and Spell' from their early years. A more modern suggestion would be Violator.
2,Expectations too high?,"After looking at the latest BILLBOARD top 40 list and seeing that I do not like any of the artists, I have to say I'm simply glad to have a new album from DM. Thanks guys!! I may have had my expectations too high for this one, because I just can't get into it. All the pre-release reviews I read said it was pure DM, but I don't think this sounds like anything they've released before, sans the track DEAD OF NIGHT on EXCITER.Tracks I listen to: SINNER IN ME, PRECIOUS, I WANT IT ALL, LILLIAN, and DARKEST STARThese tracks are good, but I feel that all of them have so much more potential. The remaining seven tracks? Too much production on them (beeps, chirps, etc...). This record sounds like someone took a blender and poured in MODE, MASSIVE ATTACK, and NIN, but left that blender on WAY TOO LONG!Again, I'm very happy to get a new DM album. Unfortunately I'm already looking forward to the next one.KB"
4,Good belt,"As usual my experience with Amazon has been great. I ordered this belt, to go along with a harness system that I am putting together. Many operator belts are very expensive. This belt is very reasonably priced, the buckle is solid, the length is great. The belt is a little on the light weight side, so it may not work for a duty belt, but it works great as an oeprators belt. And as usual the buying experience was fantastic."
2,cheap product,"This project feels, looks and is cheap --I wouldn't get it again. I had ReoTemp compost thermometers in the past (I always seem to step on them or damage them shoveling compost)and I'll get one next time after this one breaks. The needle jiggles when you move it, so it doesn't seem very accurate or strong. The ReoTemp thermometer has color coded markings for different temperature phases of the compost curing, which is very convenient, and it's a much sturdier product."
4,good,"Another fine CD containing some favourites of the late John Peel. One disappointment is that as most of these recently released newwave-oriented compilations, it contains not so many rare tracks as one would like to see. This is especially true when you consider the kind of music he played on his shows."
5,Excellent book for understanding judeo-christian and islamic,"This is the best book I have read so far that gives an honest ,lucid and credible understanding of the evolution of the judeo-christian tradition as well as islamic tradition. There are concise flowcharts that present information graphically and several references . A must read for anyone with an inquisitive mind and a definite challenge to age-old held popular idead. Very insightful into seminary education and knowledge that doesn't percolate to common peoples."
1,"Good title, although misleading","If you are interested in a book about Islam, this is for you. This is not an inter-faith dialogue, as is suggested, but an examination of what the author believes is false and what the author believes is true. He does not objectively examine the Christian faith and how Islam is similar to Christianity. It is laughable to even suggest it. It is cleary written from a Muslim perspective which the reader would be advised to keep in mind. He doesn't offer the Christian perspective at all, the title is a joke. If you are picking up this book for religious understanding, I would suggest you not waste your time. The only way interfaith diaglogue is established is by the understanding and respect by both parties in their religions similarities and differences, and explored without obvious biases. What was so insulting about this book is that the author disguised a book promoting his faith in the guise of ""an interfaith diaglogue."""
1,a strange book,"I am slightly confused on how to rate this book, becuase while it is certainly not an interfaith dialougue or unbiased look at Christianity and Islam, it may have some useful information.The auther spends this book discussing the Islamic view of Christianity. In many, many places, it sounds like he is using any resource possible to prove Chrisitanity wrong. Some of the information is interesting, but some is blatantly wrong.Overall, it is much more a fight internal to the author, explaining to himself why he is Muslim rather than Christian, than any sort of dialouge."
1,Do not use with HP Jornada,"I cannot recommend this ethernet card for use in an HP Jornada 548 PocketPC. The HP does not have an eject button for flash cards, so this particular card is nearly impossible to remove.What's more, I never successfully had the card work on my home network. It never came up with an IP address from my DHCP server, and it did not work even when I manually entered an IP address. Other PCs work fine, but I'll never know if the problem was my net or the card since Socket's tech support never responded to my inquiries.Bottom line: I returned this card for a refund."
2,Money,"It is more difficult to use than Quickbook in a practical sense. When I tried to enter a simple expense item, It took a while to look for the right pull down to get in. When I downloaded my Sear credit card history, Money2006 put expense items into credit column. It messed up my balance sheet. I always couldn't get right answer from Microsoft support for Money2006, although their tech support people are polite."
4,Money 2006,It was extremely easy to convert from Quicken and the technical support provided has been very helpful. It works awesome for those of us who have a business at home.
4,Another year but not much change,"I have used Microsoft Money Small Business for a number of years now, but sometimes wonder what benefit (other than Bill Gates getting a little richer) I am gaining from the latest version of the product - this is one of those years."
5,KELLY PRICE:A WOMAN WITH PLENTY OF SOUL,"THIS ALBUM IS THE BOMB! KELLY PRICE GIVES HER ALL ON THIS 17 TRACK CD. SHE HAS NOT ONLY A BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG VOICE, BUT SHE HAS ""THE SOUL OF A TRUE WOMAN"" A TRUE FAN, WANDA MANIER"
5,Kelly is wonderful! I can definetly feel this cd!,"This cd is for all of the ladies that are going through some hard times from everything, whether is be lack of money, man or both. When you don't have anyone else in this world, you will always have yourself. I highly recommend this cd."
5,Two Cultures Revisited,"This is a superb collection of essays by leading contemporary philosophers of religion reflecting on the great divide between philosophers of religion and theologians. As one author notes, philosophers writing on issues in philosophy of religion take theism seriously; scholars in religious studies often do not. Philosophers considering religious claims consider arguments and ask whether the claims are true; religious studies folks are more inclined to see them as cultural artifacts and treat religious belief as a social phenomenon, often dismissing the question of truth value.Philosophers will be delighted with this book; theologians will be irritated. Readers who are neither philosophers nor theologians will be tickled to get a look into the arcane worlds of academic philosophy and theology and may be surprised.All the essays are accesible--nothing heavy. A good read!"
3,it gets old.....,"Okay, so maybe for those of you that have been playing Madden for years are used to it, but I'm new at this game, and I can't say I'm all that crazy about it. I suppose if you want to really become involved in it, it might be more interesting. You can put players in motion, and glancing over the small book of ""instructions"" that came with the game, it must be possible to change blocking assignments. That would be great, considering the incredible number of sacks that occur in normal play! If you wait to look for a receiver, here they come - play action or not. And once the defenders are coming, the quarterback does not want to release the ball. I don't really want to spend hours learning all the little things that might make this game playable. If I wanted to do that, I'd go back to studying chess! There's no enjoyable setting for the casual player. And why is it when you're playing the computer, you still have to watch from the offense side of the ball when you're on defense???"
5,good as ever,"Madden just gets better every year. Some of the new features, most noteably Superstar mode, aren't really worthwhile or all that much fun. On the other hand, precision passing was a HUGE addition to this game. It makes the game even more realistic; no more blind passes across your body to the other side of the field. The truck stick really balances out the defensive hit stick nicely. The graphics arent much improved, but they were so good in the first place that it didnt matter. Overall, the greatest football simulation to date."
2,Doesn't seem to be the same product and keep sending me the wrong formula,"I used to use Goldwell for about a decade, and purchased it through my hairdresser. It is a very expensive, quality product that gives you the most amazing hair. However, since I moved I started ordering it from Amazon and this doesn't seem to be the same thing. It's just a little off, doesn't condition nearly as well at all (and it's not the climate difference or anything like that). Smells different too. I think it is not the same as what I was buying before, as in- this may be a knockoff. On top of this, twice now I have ordered the ultra rich formula and received the rich formula. This is very annoying to me and I'm not going to be buying from here any more. Buyer beware: this is not the real deal."
3,Cinderella story,"This is a good story. However, I purchased it for a unit on Cinderella type stories for my second grade class. The book is too advanced for them. I would recommend it for teens and adults. Advanced 4th and 5th grade students can also enjoy it."
5,Response,All was excellent arrived quickly and was perfect I would deal with them again anytime. Hope this helps their status
2,Not exactly what I expected,"I was excited about this CD after reading an article about its release, but after ordering it, I listened to it maybe a total of 3 times & have not heard it since. Not exactly what I expected, but I still like Jody Watleys older songs. Amazon delivered this one on time with no problems."
5,good idea book,"I am glad I added this to my collection it is great for ideas, there isn't any blue print or material list in the book, but it is helpful for ideas."
2,Save your money,"Not a bad book, but there are many better, more comprehensive books on the subject. This book was published in the 70's and is rather dated. If you're looking for a limited number of simple plans to build a small, simple cabin, its okay, but there are better books on the subject with more plans and at an economical price too."
4,"From a ""Transient"" writer","First off, I like the book. It has some real gems of wisdom in it. About the only thing that bugged me is the constant reference to genre fiction as ""transient"" fiction. Yes, ""transient"" as in ""transitional to a higher form"" (at best) or as in ""homeless transient demonstrating public incontinence"" (at worst). I can only surmise that the ""higher form"" in this case would be literary fiction, which the author goes to great pains to tell us is the only fiction worthy of anyone's time. After the read I felt, as a published author of ""transient fiction"", that I owe it to the world to someday print a book discussing ""snooty fiction"", and its relative lack of worth, at great length."
4,A Big Help for a Beginning Novelist,"Although I was an English major and taught high school students for twelve years, I found this book full of helpful tips and reminders about how to write good fiction and create believable and interesting characters. While all writers have their own style, Stein emphasizes how to make the story and its characters come to life for its readers."
5,An absolute must for the aspirant writer,"A well organized how-to for even the experienced writer. Whether you want to create a blockbuster novel or a decent newsletter, you need this book on how to keep the reader plugged in. Should be the mainline text of creative writing instructors."
1,Only If You Are A Die Hard Wang Yu Fan...,"I thought this movie was pretty bad. Too much wire work; really cheesy comedy courtesy of an annoying kid who I wished would get run through with a sword or a spear throughout the whole move; and the sound effects are terrible - whenever they hit each other, it sounds like someone is banging on a hollow cardboard box. The final fight scene has some redeaming value, which is why I am giving it 1 star. You should rent the movie first before you decide to buy it."
4,Worth getting to know.,"The Butterworth is a somewhat disjointed symphony, and not played particularly well on this disc, but repeated listening will reveal more to enjoy. The Gipps, on the other hand, is a delightful work with immediate appeal, full of catchy tunes, and expresses subdued joy after a major distaster, in this instance WW2. The playing here is more assured. A disc worth acquiring then, for those interested in neglected, conservative, middle 20th ceentury British music. though neither of these symphonies approach the epic proportions found in the symphony of E.J. Moeran, for example, or any of the symphonies of Arnold Bax, to name just two other relatively neglected composers of an earlier and similar period. [Moeran's symphony dates from 1937].An excellent booklet comes with this disc."
2,To good to be true.,"I saw this and I thought it was really cool, but then i got it (for a ripp off price of $30)out of the package, after about 20 minutes of taking the tape off, Then I hooked it up.But then, I played it, it is the same thing as the Blue Mrs. Pacman one, only wireless,1.This is way to bulky, the second thing wrong with it was that if you got more than 3 feet away from it, it wouldn't respond that good. The third thing wrong was that the sound is so faint on this, that i had to turn the TV on full blast to hear the tiniest sound. So I returned it and got the non-wireless Pac-Man game, and I like it alot better.The only thing good about this product is that it saves your score."
2,Lyrical but hollow,"Mao II has some wonderful descriptive scenes - for example, the mass wedding with which it opens. But the book lacks three dimensional, human characters, and in the end DeLillo's snazzy writing and imagery fall flat. I read it in stops and starts, because it just didn't compel me. However, I bought Underworld recently, and I'm going to give DeLillo a second try."
2,No one actually thinks and talks like these characters,"It took some doing to get through this novel. The main question that kept hitting me as I carefully read this book was: What kind of people actually think and speak in the kind of overdone, conflagration of semi-metaphysical adjectives that Delillo puts into his character's minds and mouths? The different threads of the story do not come together in the end, so there's a great sense of randomness in this novel. Further, Delillo repeats ideas, I assume, in order to make his point; but I felt a bit belittled intellectually by this. For example, in his brief section about how the crowds are going crazy trying to keep Khomeini's body out of the grave, Delillo keeps telling us over and over again what the purpose is for these people acting the way they do. It just seems like Delillo was trying too hard."
3,"Liked it better than White Noise, but not that much","I can tell my friends I've read DeLillo, both White Noise and Mao II. I liked this a little more than White Noise, but since I wasn't too crazy about White Noise, that isn't saying too much.The characters seem more real than those in White Noise, the plot seems more believeable, and the motivations make more sense. Maybe DeLillo will write a completely transparent book, and I'll love it!I first read this ten years ago, and could barely choke it down. Perhaps becoming more sophisticated, I read it a few months ago, and even enjoyed it at times.My preference is if a writer has something to say, it shouldn't be buried in situations, metaphors, and characters that simply don't occur in real life, and seem like oh so clever gimmicks. So obviously, DeLillo is not going to end up one of my favorite writers."
2,Self-indulgent,"I was impressed by the writer's skill in creating beautiful prose. However, I did not get anything else out of the book. Forgettable characters, thin plot, endless descriptions, and ultimately dull. Seemed like the writer was writing the book for himself and no one else. Rated two stars because of writer's talent and because I enjoyed the first half. Take three stars off for the meandering second half and my other complaints."
2,I just didn't get it,The first hundred or so pages of the novel are fairly interesting and easy to get through but from there the book seams to go nowhere. I had a very hard time trying to get through the rest of the novel as it meanders towards its anticlimactic ending. Yes there is some beautiful writing and keen social observations but all and all it was quite dull. It was disappointed after reading the previous reviews and hearing good things about this book I found myself trying to like but it was just too slow paced for me.
2,"Wow, that was dull","The second star is for the obvious intelligence on display and for DeLillo's mordant, incisive commentaries on post-modern society. But I must echo other reviewers complaints: this tedious narrative went nowhere and seemed to go out of its way to alienate the reader with obscure themes and unengaging characters. Every character thinks and speaks in the same voice; they are merely instruments for DeLillo's editorial content and do not resemble any homo sapiens I've met. I enjoyed White Noise and won't give up on DeLillo yet, but this one did nothing for me."
2,Dry as Hell,"I agree with the other reviewers, and just wanted to recommend books that read much better. That is to say, books with some soul, that are kickin'Gitlin, Hayes, and Weinstein - Many typos, but definitely well writtenLee and Messerschmitt - a nice read, too.Proakis will make a good reference..in Hell!!!!"
2,"A lot of formulas, very little insight","The author has, maybe, good knowledge of the material, but little contact with reality. A lot of formulas, piled up, offer practically no insight. Contrast this with the book of Sklar, ""Digital Communciations"". Proakis offers a fake ""advanced"" mathematical level, that might impress an ignorant beginning graduate student, but removes any chance of understanding the material because of the plethora of useless pictures, formulas and words.The material of the book could have been presented in a quarter of the space. It is hard to imagine a poorer writing style."
1,3.64 lbs of Pure Spirtual Abuse,"Someone with a decent grasp of com-theory giving this book five stars is beyond my comprehension. It provides instructors all the benefits of deception with virtually no risk of being deceived themselves. Even taking into account intellectual deception and cultural coercion due to a sense of professional self-preservation and survival, the use or praise of this text is beyond justification. Unless someone has the emotional intelligence of a turnip or purely enjoys seeing students in a state of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), there is no way anybody should be saying ""I love it"" (official Amazonian meaning of 5 stars) about this text."
4,pasta machine,We used this for the first time a few days ago and really enjoyed the results. Only con was trying to find a place to clamp the machine down. Fresh past really is better.
1,You get what you pay for,"I ignored the other negative reviews on here and went ahead and bought the Roma Pasta Machine. Big Mistake, after using this the first time I returned it. First off while using this black oil got on the pasta, which I would have over looked on the first use if it wasn't the other problems. Even with clap fully installed on my counter top that hangs over I could not keep this machine from flying up while I was rolling the pasta. Next on the thickest setting the gears gave out. So three strikes and I boxed it back up and returned to Amazon. Next one I buy will be a more pricey model."
4,Good Product,"I'm new to the pasta machine and I'm using it for polymer clay. Other than the handle falling off easily, it's worked out quite well for what I need. The price is really good and it sure beats trying to roll by hand!!"
2,Very difficult to use,"The sleeve is indeed too tight for the tablet, especially with the battery upgrade. I almost wondered if I was putting it in correctly at first. The flaps don't give adequate access to the ports on the side and are not centered over the ports either.The only way I would use this if I was going to ALWAYS use it in Tablet mode, which most people won't. Even then I don't know how useful it would be."
1,LOADED WITH TOO MUCH SUGAR,"This is a tasty product and makes very good frappes-- far better than the one's you're spending four dollars each for.My critism is that there is an utterly unbelieveable amount of sugar in it; so much so I get a sugar headache every time I drank it, so, I stopped buying the product. (I don't have any physical issues with sugar, and I like sugar, but, seriously, this is drinking iced sugar.)If there's a manufacturer out there that makes a great blended coffee base with low sugar, someone please post that info.MOCAFE Frappe Iced Coffee Blend, Original Mocafe Decaf, 3-Pound Tin"
5,So smooth and delicious,I think Rapunzel's is one of the best chocolates I have ever had...the dark chocolate is so smooth and the sweetness so perfect. I have had 3 different varieties now and I order a box every time it comes on sale. There is a distinct luciousness about eating a piece of this chocolate compared to many of the other organic varieties I have bought.
4,Great fun... but the size is little small,"Great product- just like the real thing! My son puts anything and everything in there and we love watching him have fun. However the blender is pretty small, and the pulse button does not work."
5,This song is HOT !,This song is super hot! Every Top 40 radio station in the U.S. needs to play this ever 30 min. Please God let Sylver Cd come out in the U.S. This song is going to be the next big dance songin the U.S.
4,I think this product actually worked! So many ...,"I think this product actually worked! So many insect repellent products make claims that aren't true. This one lives up to its claims. The mosquitoes are terrible here and I had no problem with them as long as I was wearing this bracelet. The odor is a little strong at first, like a citronella candle, and the bracelet is a little chunky. But overall, considering it kept the bugs away, I'd say it's a great product and I'll buy others for my family."
1,Worst product ever! (Still even a year later),"I left a review September of 2007. I tried the new bands they came out with yesterday, June 2008.I was still attacked by skeeters even though I put on on each wrist and one ankle. The one leg that didn't have one on was the only part of my body NOT attacked.So a year later, they STILL don't work. (This is in Northern Michigan where, believe it or not, the skeeters aren't as bad as in other places closer to woodsy or swampy areas.)"
4,sad zombie,"very dramatic for a really cheaply made film.I liked it but have seen better,two friends on the police force come to terms with betrayl and die at the hand of the woman they love."
5,off the hook,"this book was truly a ride well worth taking. these two sisters have created an erotic novel that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat with anticipation and curiosity about what's happening next with the main characters. the key party has all of the elements i see that are necessary to be a best seller: mystery, intrigue, steamy sexual interludes, drama, and shcoking surprises. i recommend this book to anyone who dares to live life on the wild side a little with respect to their sexuality and openness in relationships. keep up the good work black women! do your thing cause you truly have a gift!"
5,TEEJHA,FANTASTIC...NEXT BEST SELLER...MUST READ...DON'T MISS OUT ON THEMOST EXCITING BOOK OF 2001...GREAT JOB SIDDEEQAH AND LISA NICOLE!CAN'T WAIT FOR #2...
4,Relationships and Underlying Issues.,"It's sad how only one couple came out on top. However when you think about the underlying issues that existed in these relationships, it was a risk worth taking. I really didn't like what happened with Rick, especially after his moment with Kay. Jason's situtation should have been revealed to you know who. A great debut novel and for sho' a sequel must be on its way. Start with the conversations that came out of that ride to Cali!!!"
5,"Detailed, objective, and important history","Adolf Hitler, in writing about his decision to initiate the Holocaust, said ""Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"" This documentary assures that Hitler's observation is wrong and that nobody will forget the first genocide of the 20th Century.Just as there are those who, amazingly, seek to deny the Holocaust, there are even more subtle and vicious voices seeking to deny the Armenian Genocide committed by the Turks during World War I. This systematic murder, forced starvation, rape, and torture of more than a million Armenians introduced into the American language the phrase ""starving Armenians,"" but modern understanding of the origin of that phrase is lacking. This documentary reminds us all of the reality of what was perpetrated by a nation against its own citizens, and it should be required viewing in civics and history classes."
3,Notes and Asides,"This is a small collection of lectures in which Feynman explores, in non-scientific jargon, such matters as scientific methodology, the interplay of faith and reason, and the importance of doubt or skepticism to a scientist. Though Feynman is a non-believer religiously speaking, he is interested in faith and very respectful of it. As a fan, I do have to agree with Mr. Sinclair below that these lectures do seem hurriedly pulled together. (An editor could not have helped, however, as these are lectures as delivered and are thus original source material.) Though not the stylist we might wish for, Feynman does give us an enjoyable and quick read that gives some insight into of the great scientists of the past century and into some of the important issues we confront in politics, religion and science."
2,Not worth the money,"I love Richard Feynman. He is one of the most amazing people who ever existed. With that said I can say that you should not waste your money on this book. The really cool quotes from these lectures were already used in ""Genius"" by James Gleick and if you really are into Feynman I suggest reading that book. It is so much more useful than this one which I read in one night and walked away feeling robbed."
3,A good reference,"This volume provides a good reference for collectors of antique furniture. It includes a detailed chronology of styles and periods, coverering Europe and the US, and presents typical pieces of various categories of furniture, including details on construction. It is well illustrated. Unfortunately no relative values are provided. Also degree of rarity, popularity, etc. is also rarely mentioned.(A tip: I still think that Peter Philp's FIELD GUIDE TO ANTIQUE FURNITURE is much better. In fact, if you've got Philp's book, you don't really need this one)."
3,You won't find what you want here,"This book is certainly looks interesting for anybody wanting to learn a bit more about the art and thinking of Cartier-Bresson, and indeed it is beautifully designed and produced. Unfortunatly the the little scraps of information that it contains seem as if they have been published just beacause they have indeed come from the great masters mouth. I mean its all kind of throw away stuff obviously never intended to be published with perhaps a couple of interesting paragraphs -but you probably knew those ones anyway-. So if you really want to study his work get ""the artless art"" if you want to learn from his experience, look at his pictures, you won't get much from this one."
2,Only for children 5 and under,"If it were a review for me, I'd say OMG the worst movie I've ever seen. It looks as if a Jr. High School beginning animations class produced. it The other reviews hit that nail on the head. ((I'm amazed it was released)) But for my 5 year old, it was ok. In all honesty I was surprised, he's a pretty smart and observant child, but I guess still a child. My 7 year old was bored with it, we had to pause it 3 times over a 12 hour period to finish it. ((how long WAS this thing?)) I rented it from the redbox as well. Before purchasing anything now-a-days I try to see it (or play the game) before purchase. Shame on redbox for putting that in the lineup."
1,Terrible,"Next to their other movie, ""kyra the brave"" this is the worst animated movie I've ever watched. Terrible animation, poor writing, and a non existent plot, put this movie in pretty much a class all by itself."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER CREATED,"And not like ""The Room"" or ""Troll 2"" funny bad. This is just terrible. It has been about a month since I saw this and I am still just angry that it exists.Whoever made this movie should be imprisoned. Let the courts figure out something to charge them with. There has to be a crime here somewhere.Like others have said everything about this movie is horrible. There are MANY times where the charcters just sway standing next to each other without any words being uttered.If there was a plot I have no idea what it was. It said it was a short movie but for some reason it actually did last way longer than it said on the DVD or online.I had to take it back that very night because I didn't even want to see the stupid dogs face in my house anymore.There are just no words to describe how horrible it is. If you see this DVD anywhere please break it. You will be saving someone a great deal of anger and contempt."
1,Suck doesn't begin to describe ...,WORST...MOVIE...EVER! I believe that those of us that were duped into renting this steaming pile of dung by the cover have cause for a class action lawsuit!
1,How can the creators of this movie sleep at night?,Probably the worst movie ever made. The dialogue is horrendous. I can't believe this movie is an hour and 40 mins? Complete garbage.
1,Awful. My 3 year old wandered off after 5 minutes of this garbage.,"First of all, this is available for a little over a dollar to rent if you're willing to drive to pick it up. Don't. Don't watch this movie if someone gives it to you for free. It plays like a student film that was never edited, thrown away, and then picked out of the trash by drunk people who then added voice overs and 'music.'Shame on you Amazon for even having this available."
1,Wow! This has got to be a joke. Seriously?,"We rented this on redbox at the request of our six year old. Within minutes our four year old was begging to return the movie because it is so boring!My husband said this movie must have been made for people who are on drugs, by people who are on drugs!It has to be a joke or a mass prank-- to see how many bad reviews it can get. People would have to seriously TRY to make something this bad. I can make an animated doodle on the corner of a notebook that is higher quality and more interesting!Gah! I we are letting our kids stay up late to watch a different movie. We let it play as long as we could stand it... But it never gets better. If you think, ""it must get better at some point..."" it NEVER does!DO NOT BUY THIS-- you're probably contributing to someone's drug habit if you do."
1,WASTE OF TIME,I think this was a high school student's final project in animation class. WORST MOVIE EVER! It wouldn't even hold the attention of our toddler. I'd rather stick a fork in my eye and watch Barney.
1,Where is my DVD?????????????,"Hi , I have not yet received this DVD It was meant to be a Xmas gift . Very diapointed"
1,bad mastering...a nightmare,Another great recording ruined by incompetent mastering. All dynamics gone.....a sonic nightmare. When is this annoying trend going to end?
5,Enchanting,"Enchanting mood, mellow but far from boring. Sting seems very comfortable presenting this music which doesn't resemble the music of his early career. It is mature and as well crafted as anything I have heard from him."
3,"Blow hot, blow cold","'Surgeon-Commander Simon Redman did not in the least want to take charge of an eighteen-year-old ward, and Sally Galbraith felt no moreenthusiastic about her stern guardian-to-be.But each of them was to change their mind before the end of the story.'"
3,"Blow hot, blow cold","'Surgeon-Commander Simon Redman did not in the least want to take charge of an eighteen-year-old ward, and Sally Galbraith felt no more enthusiastic about her stern guardian-to-be. But each of them was to change their mind before the end of the story.'"
1,reads fine but DON'T format,yes this is a handy little card reader but don't even think about formating your flash media in this device. It will corrupt the cards so that they are unusable. There is now a small notice on the imation site FAQ page about this problem - unfortunately they don't say how to fix it.
3,I liked the smell and lather of the ...,"I liked the smell and lather of the shampoo, however, I didn't feel the product was anything special as far as volumizing. I have very thin hair and didn't notice extra body or volume after using it."
3,A little lackluster,"I'm a huge fan of this series, but I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as the others. I have to agree with another reviewer that said that the identification of the killer was so abrupt that it almost left me wondering if I missed some pages or something. I think that Roarke's behavior in this book became a little annoying. And I did not like the angry sex scene in this book. These two are always so loving with each other that it seems way too out of the ordinary. It's also starting to wear on me that Roarke has his nose in every little thing that Eve does. Give me a break! He should be more of a peripheral character than being thrust into the middle of every mystery."
5,JD Robb is great!,I love JD Robb's Death Series and all of the great characters in her books. This is my second time through the series and I'm finding it's even better the second time =)
4,"Good book, bad editing","Another good book in this series. The killer was pretty easy to guess, but the byplay between the characters keep things interesting. I do wonder, though, how long the cops are going to look the other way about Rourke's past. One of these days it's bound to trip him up.What really bugged me about the book was the editing job. What's with the misspellings and bad fact checking. Utumna, Iowa? Please. Robb deserves better than that.Let's have more of the series. Just a little less sloppiness."
1,Disaster!,"This product was horrible! The first day I got it, it sounded different, but I didn't think much about it. After a few weeks,the volume would not go louder than the voice of someone whispering to me. Soon after that, the speakers were blown,and you couldn't even hear the music coming out of them. All you could hear was the boom boom crack crack of the speakers. I highly DO NOT recommend this product for anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Nice Design But...,"I have been using it for about a month and was very happy with the sound and the compact design. Unfortunately, yesterday it started giving me problems by cutting in and out. Whether the power source was battery or USB, the power would go off after a few seconds and then, after some fiddling, come back on; only to go out again. It now has become a nice paperweight."
4,Very Fun; Kind of Unfair,"This is a very fun game. It is very easy to learn how to play. However, it is kind of unfair. The person who gets the first strike usually always wins because they could just use the same attacks over and over again, which prevents the other person to attack."
3,The movie seemed better - but perhaps I misremember,"I recall seeing the 1962 filmed version of this watching late night TV with my father back when I was thirteen or so. I haven't seen the film since then, but I remember it being very provocative and moody. Sort of like ""The Summer of '42."" Or maybe it was just my hormones.(I also recall seeing Sophia Loren in ""Madame Sans Gene"" with the Old Man. La Loren was wearing a peasant blouse and helping Napoleon's soldiers to shove a cannon into place. Whew. THAT I remember well.)But it's the book that's under consideration here. Frankly, I found it a bit disappointing. Whereas the film suggested things, the book states them outright - which is poorer, I think.Anyway... disappointing. See the film, if you can. (It hasn't been released, but I understand that it has played on TCM.)"
3,BORING!!!! but still okay,This book was as boring as the movie! Where's the action???? Hopefully the next one will be better!
3,Certainly not their best,"I do find myself reading it again and again, but the movie really bit the bog on againist Winning London. They jiust jumped onto a plane, there wasn't a back story so poo on that. And my bro says the theory is they are getting older its harder for them to do cutesy movies. I'd love to see a movie with a twin in it without the other."
4,Tangram very special!,"This book is interesting because Valere Marsh use the tangram to tell stories. But the new shapes she added aren't always easy to cut (in cardboard).There are legends and folktales (""Jack & the bean tree"", ""The legend of Scarface"", The lion & the mouse"", ""Why the sun & moon live in the sky"" and others) and stories about science and history (""The discovery of silk"", ""Penicillin"", ""The history of Pizza"", ""Volcanoes"", ""Beautiful but poisonous butterflies""...). There are 20 stories."
5,Cute,"Bought this to use as a phtography prop for my daughter and a few jobs here and there. I used it for an infant photo shoot and plan to use it for my daughter and friends. Great quality, great size and well worht the buy."
1,Free Subscribtions? I don't think so...,"I was always interested in trying it, but I like to play offline first. Well, I recieved this as a gift, tryed the 'free subscription' well lets just say its FREE IF YOU BUY ANOTHER SUBSCRIPTION.I tryed the game didn't like the controls or the first person. So I canceled my subscription, and NO REFUNDS!!"
3,one of my favourite songs is on this,"i bought this album one morning wandering around a record shop in a groggy state - when i put the headphones on the clarity of vika and linda's voices cut straight through the haze and i couldn't resist it. little did i know at the time that the last song on the album (""the blue hour"") would become one of my all-time favourite songs - it's a mesmerising ballad with clarinets rolling and surging behind the crystal clear voices. every time i listen to this track it affects me beautifully. the rest of the album is bouncy happy (slightly reggae and slightly country) stuff that can irritate a little but is generally uplifting. australian music god paul kelly had a lot to do with the album, helping write a number of the songs."
3,Weather Station,I'm not sure how accurate this product is because I have never tested it against another thermometer. Having more than 1 input for multiple sensors is nice if you want to put a sensor in the garage or something. The display is not as good as our previous model however. Unless you stand directly in front of it the numbers and pictures are hard to see.
4,interesting and fun,"a quick read, the book follows the author on a quest to move to the uk and buy a house, loosly told through essays relating to the house hunting experience. the best thing about the book is all the cool tidbits of info, like exactly how to judge a book by it's cover, or the stuff used in book bindings is the same stuff used in fast food milkshakes. some interesting turns of phrase show up, all quoted from obscure books i never would have known about. he paints a descriptive picture on life in the uk, how it differs from the us, and although he seems biased for the uk in some spots, he suddenly turns around and shows favor to the u.s. i also enjoyed the fact that he writes intelligently, and has faith in his readers enough to not dumb down or make things obvious (which, as it turns out, he mentions in one chapter). i liked the book, and i got a kick out of the rather witty chapter titles. a good tale overall."
2,A Little Light Reading,"There is enough material in this book - nice set pieces, and some interesting and humorous quotes - for a great magazine article. But after a while I got bored by its two themes: 1) the cuteness of the baby, the town, and the author; and 2) fodder for trivial pursuits. There is not enough substance here for a whole book, and the prose, vague, and a little trendy, does not compensate. A potboiler."
4,Its a solid bag,"I was a bit nervous about buying the bag because of its price. It was less than 100 dollars which typically means it'll last about a month before coming apart at the seams. I went ahead with it anyway and after a month I can say its a great bag. I travel every week and it still looks like I took it out of the box. It fits perfectly into airplane overhead cabins and yet expands to fit everything I need. Its no tumi, but works well."
2,delsey - o.k.,"i purchased the delsey helium breeze because my husband has been pleased with his delsey carry-on. first time i used it, the zipper pull came off in my hand. during the trip and multiple openings for tsa, customs, etc., i found the zippers all uncooperative and sticky. suitcase is fine and i'll probably get a lot of use out of it, but there seem to be a lot of finishing touches left unfinished.two yrs forward: all the brand-name tags have pulled off during (multiple) handling(s). several of the zipper pulls have come off, and the expandable section's zipper has pulled apart. (i am not a rough traveler)"
4,Leather credit card holder wallet,"This leather wallet is as described.Feels and smells like good quality leather - smells like new shoes (-:.Has a windowed ID compartment, an expandable credit card compartment (I put 12 cards in it to test) - could hold 14 - but then it's no longer slim. There is also a slot on that same side that can hold maybe two cards but no more. There is an outside slot as well that I put one business card in tightly.I feel it was a good purchase for my needs."
2,This is a disposable wallet.,"This wallet was a good value at purchase, but the poor quality thread or sewing had it nearly into two separate pieces in about a year."
5,Great Wallet,This wallet is great at any price.The quality of leather is good and its roomy enough to hold lots of stuff.The window is good for ID or passes.I may buy again.
2,I don't like it.,I am retuning due to not big enough for my credit cards. I was disappointed in the wallet only. Thanks
4,Perfect Earring,This is the perfect size hoop for work. Not too big but big enough to be in fashion.
3,Stress relief,"14 Serene Scenes of Relaxation, Wellness, and Stress Relief DVD. I work from home and play this in the background. You can select the scenes you want to play the type of music/sound or play all. I like the Ambient water best."
3,Rather average,I am unimpressed with the poetry in this book. I have read it with a glass of wine and it left unsatisfied with the reading and the wine. It is possible I wanted to think differently about home. This didn't inspire me in any way. I read it front to back and back to front. It was like a jigsaw puzzle when completed and you find a piece is missing.
2,not for me,I usually like thrillers and i liked curtis in a fish called wanda so I thought why not bottom line I didn't like it w/ thrillers u got to stick w/ the classics
4,A good read. I'm waiting for book 2!,"An excellent story (apparently Jimmy Doohan's) told well (apparently Stirlings writing). Not real deep, not a work of art, but a very good read and very entertaining. (A lot like Star Trek.) I am waiting for book 2, not because book 1 leaves the plot hanging or anything, but like candy, I want more"
5,This the one of my favorite books!,The Rising by S.M. Stirling and James Doohan is a masterpiece. This book is a must read for anyone who likes Science Fiction. Order this book now!
4,"Fine book, terrible marketing ploy (not the author's fault)","This is a careful scholarly work by a professor emeritus from Berkely. You'd never know it from the tasteless and garish cover the publisher stuck on the hardback edition: it shows the late Princess Diana with her two sons, posed over a coffin that has a note entitled ""Mommy"". The author offers a detailed account of the crass and clumsy attempt by the publisher to use his scholarly work to cash in on the Princess' death -- an attempt made over his strong protests. The entire story can be read in the March 2000 edition of Brill's Content. Revulsion of the reviewers finally led the publisher to change the cover of the softcover edition to something more tasteful. Don't let the tabloid mindset of the publisher turn you away from an otherwise fine anthology."
4,I really liked this product. I've used St ...,"I really liked this product. I've used St Ives products before, but never shampoo. It cleaned my hair thoroughly and I just used the shampoo once; never had to """"repeat"""" to get my hair clean. It was gentle enough that it didn't strip the coloring from my hair. The only complaint I had was that there didn't seem to be any scent. I'd most likely purchase this shampoo again."
5,Paramedicine in all of it's reality....GREAT job!,"I couldn't put this one down until I had read it from cover to cover. As a Medic for 14 years, I found myself, laughing and crying along with those who tell thestories the best: paramedics. For anyone who is a Medic, ever wanted to be, or cares about one, this book should be required reading!"
5,A Good Introduction,I am a newcomer to the world of Yoga and this book was easy to follow and informative. It furthered my interest in Yoga and gave helpful suggestions on how to pursue this interest. Great for beginners!
4,Good Purchase,"This is a good, textbook like manual for a campaign manager and staff. I highly recommend it. It is not the only book a CM and staff should read, but it is one of the several most important."
2,"Put the postmodern waffle on the side, please.","Perhaps it's the translation, but the author comes off as overly dubious about the field he claims to want to introduce to us. The book might be useful to philosophers who want to pick fights with a-life enthusiasts, but it's very unsatisfying if you want to learn anything. Some philosophy of science books are much more than cursory glances at the science (Cartwright's How the Laws of Physics Lie or Mayo's Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge come to mind), but this isn't one of them. There are so many facinating paths that you can explore starting from the idea of a-life that Emmeches' attempts to fence-in the field come across as premature and pointless."
5,Awesome collection,It has 2 games in one as well as one of the animated movies. Both games work well and are fun to play.
3,There Is A Problem With This Collection,"Street Fighter Anniversary Edition is good to play. To good part is playing Street Fighter 2: The Anniversary Edition and having Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie on here.But here's the bad part...Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike. This games is wack and Gil is too damn hard and boring. The only thing good about that game is Gil's theme.If you get this, just get it for Street Fighter 2: Anniversay Edition and Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie. Don't even bother playing Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike...it sucks."
3,Pretty good,"If you like games like Baldur's Gate and Gauntlet Legends, this game may be for you. It's not too complicated, but the options are limited, and after a while of playing you may get a headache from having to spend an hour or two in each stage. Definitely for fans of the AD&D series, but may not be that fun for those who get bored easily of repetive gameplay. Replay value=1/5"
2,Did Not Remove Cataracts,"Took these pills and did Eyebright eyewash for six months.My cataracts are worse.It may be effective for other uses, however it did not remove or even reduce my cataracts."
4,Great Icepack,This has been a good icepack. The only thing I wish they had done was make the pocket deeper that the icepack slips into.
5,I happened to receive this product immediately after ...,"I happened to receive this product immediately after dying my hair. This was perfect timing, since this product is for treated hair, and a good conditioner is particularly important immediately after a coloring process. I was very impressed with the conditioning qualities of the product. My hair felt particularly soft after using it, even after having colored my hair. On top of it all, this conditioner smells fantastic. I'd definitely recommend this product to others."
4,Having been a fan of St. Ives products ...,"Having been a fan of St. Ives products for some time, I was excited to test this product. The St. Ives Swiss Spa Moisturizing Conditioner with Aloe Vera & Echinacea was another great product. The first thing I noticed and liked was the smell. It has a nice fresh smell, not overly powerful. After applying and rinsing, the conditioner rinsed out easily with no residue. My hair felt soft and healthy and smelled great too! I also ended up ordering the matching shampoo because I was very happy with the results I obtained with the conditioner. This is a terrific price for a super product from St. Ives. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
3,"OK as a Nav, but as a sound system, useless","I bought this principally as a way to play my iPod and CDs. The Nav was a great bonus.The way it worked out is that the Nav is great, the iPod experience is pathetic. Not useable, completely and utterly useless. If you are the kind that has but a few songs on your iPod, this might work for you (as long as you don't mind not being able to navigate those few songs). If you have more than 10 songs on it, send it back.Who'd have thought finding the pause on a sound system would be difficult?Go figure. What a waste of time and money on this."
5,Love Capcom Fighting Games,This game goes perfect with my fighting collection. Great price and made by Capcom. The game is great.
1,I miss the glory days of Capcom...,"Is the 2D fighter dead? No, it is Capcoms Fighting Game Department that is dead. After well balanced and innovative games such as Marvel vs. Capcom, Street Fighter Alpha 3, 3rd Strike, and Capcom vs. SNK 2, Capcom has given us crap for years. This title is no different. It is a bunch of recycled sprites, mismatched systems, and poor hit detection.Seriously, if you want to a fun, new, 2D fighter these days, play something by Arc Systems such as Guilty Gear or the Rumble Fish. Leave Capcom's trash alone until they stop recycling and give us something new."
1,save your money,"for the 4 bucks you could spend on these 10 songs, buy a punk-o-rama cd with twice as many songs by good bands. the offspring cover of ""hey joe"" is worthless. don't buy this cd unless you've got the money to burn."
1,This Book Is Fatally Boring,"This is the type of book that I would expect to really enjoy, based on my fondness for Bridget Jones' Diary, The Devil Wears Prada, The Second Assistant, etc. I don't know who bribed the reviewers on the back cover or some of the other reviewers from this website, but contrary to their remarks, this book is actually painfully dull."
1,waste of money,I have bought a fair share of books from amazon and completely happy. This book is a total waste of money at any price. I can't even read 10% of the text. Such a disappointment.
2,"MAndy, Junk","Mandy moore is GREAT. but this book... I dunno just like the backstage pass another junk has came out. But nice cover picture though :) Instead of buying this book, try this instead. *Donate the money to charity* WAs that helpful?"
4,Fits Perfectly Between My Toilet Base & Wall,Just what I'd hoped it would be for a small space in my bathroom next to the toilet. Seems sturdy.
3,nice starter set,"I got this set for my 4 year old twin nieces. The colors help with recognizing the dot patterns. The instructions include several different variations of the game, which was interesting for me. The case is a compact, sturdy tin - makes it easy to put the pieces back. I thought the pieces fairly large (in comparison to the small black ones I was used to). The patterns and colors were distinct, and easy to recognize - not blazingly bright colors, but acceptable enough for now. Must have been part of the manufacturing process, but I had to air the set out before we used them - bad burnt plastic smell."
5,A good way to ease into a complex environment,"ATL addresses the typically overweight Active-X components that carry around unnecessary MFC baggage. Being template driven, it provides a set of problems new to C++ programmers who have become comfortable with the MFC classes. COM is also a science unto itself (see Inside COM, Rogerson, MSPress). Here we have a set of authors who KNOW how complacent a lot of Windows Programmers have become. They introduce you to the ATL paradigm and show practical applications of this new technology. I found it extremely useful, even though it was a little scant in the DCOM arena. A good intro. You may want to look at the Professional DCOM book (when available) if you've already burned this bridge."
3,Boulder was Cool once !,Kashner writes with a humility that grows on the reader. The first half of the book was a sort of get acquainted period and the second half was frequently a gutbuster laugh. Of all the Beats he met Corso was his best pal. Ginsberg gets the wilting pansy label and Burroughs Sr comes off a lot more human and funny then most other portraits. The style of memory memoir is fine with mini chapter style. A fun read.
2,Not cool,"I set out to read this book because I am very interested in the school itself, which I still maintain, but I was sorely disappointed with the book itself. It should have been divided into two seperate stories, one about Kashner and one about the school--but how could he write a memoir and not include how ""cool"" he was--hanging out with the beats?I most certainly agree with Chris Jansen's list of problem's with this book. The obscure literary references were incredibly frustrating, it just led to me feeling alienated and uneducated. At one point Kashner refers to Ginsberg as a ""jambon"" for no reason but to, apparently, demonstrate his talent at remembering French words for food.Don't waste your money on this one, wait till your library gets it, or, if you're desperate to own it, until it comes to paperback."
1,rubish,"These glasses are absolute rubish.I ordered 3 of them! One pare is missing those rubber things that rests on your nose, the 2 other pares was miscolored and had scratches on the lensesAnd all 3 pares where oblique, and the lences where about too fall out!gave them 1 star because I could not give them 0"
2,Elite Metal Aviator Sunglasses with Mirror Lens - 1375,"These are very low quality sunglasses, but I'll give them two stars for style and fast shipping."
1,"Wrong item,wrong seller","Seller sent me wrong item.I sent mail them but they didn't answer.This must be ""100% Satisfaction Guarantee"" as they say !!! But whose satisfaction???"
5,"Foster democracy, read this book!","Al presents a wonderful, informative look into the world of the media. He leaves you with no anger at the majority of liberals or conservatives in the general public, only a wary distrust of the loud and aggresive tactics used by the minority controlling the far right. Very interesting book, which he seems to encourage you to take with a grain of salt, since his entire point seems to be that we shouldn't immediately accept what commentators say at face value.And WHY are people suggesting that we read ""Treason"" instead of this book? If you don't like Al Franken, there have GOT to be lots of conservative books that are much better and intelligent than ""Treason"". I tried to read it, out of curiousity, and it is almost unintelligible. I'd probably agree with a lot of conservative values if they'd get some spokespeople out there who seemed honest and intelligent."
1,narcissism at best..,"Besides the fact that this guy is completely full of himself, and perhaps narcissistic, he is an ignorant hypocrite. A more appropriate title and cover page for this book is to change the pictures to Pelosi, Obama, Dodd and himself, and title it ""Insight into the mental disorder of liberals."" This guy is a sad joke. What's ironic is his attacks on Rush Limbaugh, who has flourished at everything Al failed at. And there is a reason this book is selling for a PENNY and his others as well, because they're not even worth the cost of paper to print this nonsense."
2,Could have been better,"Franken is a relatively funny guy, but he's at his funniest when he's not at his angriest; in this particular book he's up against folks who disagree with him politically, and his writing degenerates to name-calling a fair bit of the time...and name-calling doesn't require wit, just flippancy.It's a shame: There ARE good arguments against ""the right,"" but this book suggests that Franken doesn't actually know them. I think his earlier Limbaugh book was a better effort (Limbaugh's a bigger target; or at least, he was before he lost weight)."
1,Stupid and uninformed,"This man is so left of center that reading anything by himis a journey into total fiction. As fiction, it is funnyand easy to read. He is a comedy writer and will alwaysbe that."
1,In the Fiction Area,"If you like a good laugh, read this book. If you want information and facts, look somewhere else.Bookstores need to display this book in their fiction area. Al Franken presents an accurate depiction of reality as about as well as Michael Mooredoes. Factless opinions are fictions, and this book is full of fictions."
3,Not Franken's Best,"The problem with this book seems simple to me. Franken seems towant it to be both a potically humorous work, and a scathingexpose on lies told by prominent conservatives.Unfortunately, trying to be two things at once meant hesucceeded at neither.Not to say he doesn't reveal some blatant lies on the right;he does, but there's nothing really stunning in it.And not to say that the book isn't funny; it is, but notroll-on-the-floor hilarious.There are other flaws, too. One that springs to mind isthe large amount of space he devotes to debunking right-wingclaims about Democrats making Paul Wellstone's funeralinto a political rally. The chapter runs *long*. Perhapsthat is because, sad as I am to admit it, his argumentsthere are weak.Franken has done better: most notably, the hilarioussatirical novel ""Why Not Me?"" But this one doesn't likeup to his earlier standards."
1,Al Franken - Still Good For A Little Comic Relief,"More than 50 copies of this book now available for REsale onAmazon.com says it all: even the lefties can't wait to dump it.That this book is not a ""keeper"" (or even a pass-around) speaksvolumes for Franken's ""fair and balanced"" viewpoint. The onlylying liars are Franken and HIS cronies who milk the system froma position of media elite; then whine about its ""inequities.""Back in the 70s, Franken's work on Saturday Night Live rarelyfailed to bring some humor to the dark days of Jimmy Carter.It's good to see he's still writing comedy; this one is purefiction."
2,No liberal bias in the media? You haven't proved anything.,"Using jargon, shallow arguments, and multiple relentless insults, Al Franken believes he has proven that Republicans are always wrong and that Liberals can do nothing wrong. Well, Mr. Franken has little solid to prove his points and make his case. He paints with a wide brush, generalizing about the republican party and about the usual jargon. Nothing more than propaganda with little to back it up. No liberal bias in the media? Please, for God Sakes. Look at The LA Times and how they handled the California Recall Election and tell me that there's no liberal bias in the media. I've read many books that have valid points conclusively proving that Bush is a bad president or that Republican social policy is messed up. However, this book is far from that and has no proof to back up anything he says whatsoever."
5,Laugh Out Loud funny,"This is possibly the funniest book I've ever read. That is a feat considering this is my third book by Franken. I'm sure I'll read it many times just like the others. One thing for certain is that this is the most honest book about the Bush administration, Fox News, etc. that I've ever seen. Keep it up, Al!"
1,How Would Al Know the Difference?,"messr.al had better clean up his own act before he calls others liars. He has been rebutted on most of his books and thoroughly - when he quotes FAIR, you know you are being hoodwinked. Was amazed at the good reviews from the so-called editorials. Gave me great insight into the ""vast liberal left wing"". Point being, you can read anything by this guy and know that it is personally made up by him and put forth as gospel truth. Best advice, save your money, buy a used Penneys' catalog, far more interesting than this bilge."
1,The biggest liar himself (except for Satan) is on the cover.,"I wish there was an option for NO stars... Pointless drivel from someone who should've stuck to comedy. ""Your're not smart enough, not good enough, and dog gone it FRANKEN... people are not going to like you"". Not after realizing they wasted part of their life reading this. May God have mercy on you Al.Franken presents unsubstantiated claims in what amounts to nothing more than personal attacks on anyone who disagrees with his wacko viewpoints. When the ""other side"" presents viewpoints in this fashion they are called intolerant, racist, hate mongors, and oh yeah... ""liars""... yet because Franken is a liberal, the liberal press and editorialists eat up this garbage.Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for this kindling... I'll be returning my copy to the public library, for the next unsuspecting victim."
1,Lies and the Comedian that told them,Al Franken has no view on politics he does not know politicts he was on Third Rock the one time he was good at politics.My dad hated him on SNL but I thought he was okay as Stuart Smalleybut he does not know anything at all no experience what so ever at all is necessary for these books.Hes not like General Brokaw who has tons of experience.I say this book is a disgrace to politics and the only thing worse is Micheal Moore I will pass.Everyone knows that the real racist are the Liberals they pick everyone out as just being black.My grandpa is a Liberal and he is 79 and he hates Black people me and my dad and my other grandpa who is deceased were not liberal and not Racist.My Grandpa said the words I like Gonzaga because they are white I said Grandpa black people are cool don't diss them.
4,what's happening in the media and it won't depress you.,"A great read. I couldn't put it down. Following the Fox suit, and seeing the C-Span book show, I had to get the book. It's nice to see well researched and documented reporting, and it won't depress you, like reading buzzflash or truthout will.Great read, although I do feel that the Bob Jones ""university"" bit didn't quite fit the theme of the book, but Mr. Franken did apologize for it.And it was wonderful to finally get a true account of the wellstone memorial.I never was a big fan of Al Franken's... until the C-Span book show.Thank you Al."
1,Just look at his titles,"No need to read his books just read the titles, and you have covered the ""depths"" of not only the whole book but his intelligence as well. He talks about everyone not having thier facts straight, but I dont see him giving references to all his ""truths"". Al's what my kids call ""a wanta be"". Sorry"
1,It changed my mind,"As a longtime liberal, from a multigenerational liberal family, I chuckled when a friend gave me this book as a gag gift. I read the first chapter, and though I agreed with the contents, it was quite unhumorous and not entertaining, but I continued with the rest.By the end of the book, I felt disillusioned, and began questioning the moral superiority I had always assumed liberalism had. Through a soul-searching process that extended over several months, I began realizing that most of my true values are closer to conservatism, and it has only been the constant, deadening rhetoric of the left that had kept me from this realization.In short, while I approached this book with a snort, it ended up transforming my political views. I was expecting just a pleasant read backed up with evidence, but instead I found a nasty polemic, positions backed up with no evidence, and embarassing revelations of liberal moral hypocrisy, and a really unfunny read."
4,Eye opener ...,Kudos to Al Franken for taking on the right-of-John-Birch wingnut talking heads and politicos. Franken deals with weighty issues with candor and comedy. The book is readable. I'll keep it and re-read it in 9 months. I may need to be reminded of the negative excesses of Shrub and da boyz before the election.
2,more mud slinging,"This book is sad.Then again, I think all books that take pot shots at their political opposites without looking for the root of the problems and how best to solve theses problems are equally sad.There are lies and truths on both sides of the political fence.A good idea is a good idea! I don't care who came up with the idea or who gets credit. Just act upon the good idea.What little good there is about books like these is that they generate discussion and debate about the issues.You have a brain, use it.Focus on the issues and leave the mud to the trolls and the pigs like Franken AND Limbaugh."
1,I can't give ZERO stars?!,I thought Clinton or Carter were liars! This guy is a bloody hypocrite!!! 100% UN-AMERICAN!!!Somebody send this communist back to Russia where he belongs!
1,Al Franken is worse than a liar,"Al Franken is something worse than a liar - he's a coward. His left wing rantings are always couched as ""humour"" when, in fact, they are simply the same old liberal clap trap parroted by a guy whose career ended when Stuart Smalley left SNL. Franken is pretty much just what he looks like -- a puppet -- . If the press weren't dominated by left wing ideologues like the New York Times and network television news talking heads, this guy would be little more than a pimple on the underside of show biz. The review by the New York Slimes that is part of the on line sales pitch tells you all you need to know."
2,Mediocre comedian makes good by ticking off Bill O' Reilly.,"Congratulations! Not a hard thing to do, considering O' Reilly is Al Franken's gas-filled twin on the Right.But really, who are these people who think it's a good book? A friend gave me a copy and it wasn't as grand as it's hyped to be. The real problem with Al is that he's as shrill as many of his pals, and unfortunately it's only getting worse with each election. What, he couldn't top Stuart Smalley? Not very enlightening or entertaining. Wait to get this at a used bookstore if you want a better deal, you won't feel as ripped."
1,Al Franken is a nut,Franken's deep seated hatred for the right polarizes all his writing and leaves his arguments lacking any objectivity.
1,Another stupid tome from Stuart Smalley,"When is Franken going to grow up? The title of this thing alone should indicate to readers a little something about what this guy's concept of ""balance"" is. This is nothing more than a rehash of all the recent (FAIR, anyone?) baseless criticisms of the conservative media, and it's about as fresh as a Frenchman's boxer shorts. Avoid at all costs."
1,Lies is a poor read,"I was out shopping and ran across this book. I read several pages before I had to put it down in disgust. Not only was it poorly written, it was obviously written with hostile intent to defame people who held opposing views other than the authors"
1,lyingliar.com The Official Homepage of Al Franken!,"Even if I was out of tp, I wouldn't use these pages because I wouldn't want to taint the *$%t still sticking to my @ss.Al Franken would have made a real nice abortion."
4,Franken's Smart Enough and I Like Him,"Al Franken exposes where real media bias exists and the imps that set the infamous ""fair and balanced"" table for us each day..."
3,A necessary read for Fox News watchers.,"Al Franken's politics are well known and like his conservative brethren he has an agenda from the outset of his book. However, his first few chapters are very strong, though he runs out of steam towards the middle. Yes, he has a personal agenda against O'Reilly, Coulter, and Hannity amongst others. But at least in this book he explains why he has these problems, and you should too. He dissects some of the arguments and charges of the right. How they lie with statistics or use broad assumptions which the general public accepts as fact.Like any book of this ilk it must be taken with a grain of salt. The book takes on the Republicans but at least it tries to do so with some journalistic integrity."
5,About Time!,"From Bush to Coulter to O'Reilly, Al Franken rips conservatives a new one exposing the blantant lies and misinformation spread by these right-wing zealots. Someone please give this man a TV show!"
5,Very Intersting Book,"I don't buy into reading political books of this genre too often but after the stink Fox News mad about the title of this book I had go and read what all the fuss was about. This book was hard to put down. He takes on O'Reilly and Coulter and makes them look even more dim witted than they already are. He has a very easy style to read and the sarcasm is just dripping on most of the pages. What I like about Mr. Franken the most is that he tells the truth on these topics, even if he did or said something off color, etc, he will readily admit he was wrong. Unlike O'Reilly who will deny it to the ends of the earth, or yell down whoever is disagreeing with him. Even if you are a Conservative this would be a good read, its not slanted one way or the other really it just tries to balance out the Radical Conservatives that have been running the news. Do yourself a favor pick up a copy, even if you don't agree with what he has to say, you will still laugh throughout the entire book."
1,Al Franken - Moron,"Boy, I have to say, the level Liberal Democrats have bottomed out at is one of the most gratifing and gripping black comidies I have ever had to pleasure of seeing. Thank you Al for doing such a brilliant job of leading the mindless sheep that have praised your book over the clif! You have thoroughly proved the point, that members of the Democratic party would rather be lead by morons from Hollywood rather than real leaders that are capable of making real SERIOUS decisions. You keep it right up Al! I just love watching you fools squirm, moan and groan so ineffectually!"
2,Entertaining...,"Al Franken is a talented comedy writer, so it's no surprise that this book is laughably one-sided. His writing style is good and should even evoke a chuckle from conservatives who don't take themselves too seriously. Don't pretend this book is any more than what it is: a humor piece with a political agenda. The title alone (and that of his Limbaugh book) should tell anyone that they're not getting a serious read here. I shake my head at people who want to attach too much importance to celebrity tomes. It reminds me of some acquaintances who considered the movie ""Dogma"" to be a valid reference on religion. Franken IS funny, though!"
1,Check the used book market,The book is only a few weeks old and is selling for $3 used. That tells you what you need to know about the content. This book will thrill the lemmings who just want to read the rants but offers no intellectual challenges for those who have any critical reasoning faculties.
4,"STOP IT! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP IT!!!","I'm so tired of reading reviews on political books only to find they are nothing but 1-star and 5-star reviews. I found this book to be entertaining and insightful, though I wish it had been a little funnier. Now for my message to other reviewers: I bought this book because I'm a liberal, and I liked it. I have not reviewed any Ann Coulter or Bill O'Reiley books because I would never buy them. Therefore, I do not review books I don't buy. I'm so tired of all the conservatives who went to this book and mindlessly bashed the title (obviously the only part of it they read)- since you're conservative, you probably have never read this book. So you have no right to review it. That's what the review section is supposed to be all about- INSIGHT FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE READ THE BOOK. I don't review Ann Coulter books, so you shouldn't review this one. Thank you."
1,Entertaining if nothing else,"I always get a chuckle from an entertainer like Al, but as far as his ability to present a serious argument or position to actually consider-- I do not think so. I would say to pick-up a copy if you would like some easy or superficial reading like a magazine."
1,a race for the top spot,"The sad part is Frankin didnt bother to research this himself, had to rely on the Harvard student body (which doesnt say much for them). He spends a chapter on how Bill O'Reilly mistook a Poke for a Peabody award several years back and you cant help to think with O'Reilly being on the news and all over the media if thats the best he could come up with. That like saying you went to McDonalds for lunch and someone finding out you were at Burger King insted. This book was a waste of alot of good trees."
1,Childlike.,I have listened to 6 yr. kids that made more sense. This book sounds like a brat in need of attention.
1,Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced,"I didn't pay for the book and I am so thankful. Any body who pays for this trash will be upset. How can this guy get away with this slander and not get sued. Thank God for the freedom that Al can write this trash. We know how stupid he is. It was really hard to read this and not get upset with the fact of people will believe some of Al's lies. The Title might reflect Al's Autobiography. Be careful what you say, you might tell what you do on an everday basis."
4,it's all in the title,"Some of the stuff in this book makes me sick. The chapter on some of the stuff the media did to Al Gore and the second 2 chapters in particular stood out. Franken does not ""name call"" as one might infer from the title, he spits out fact after fact and allows you to make up your mind. A great insight into how the media can turn the tables on a person's life. The book bashes Bush some, but it can be enjoable, regardless political opinions."
1,Liberal Hate Speech,Typical left-wing ranting. Full of bull and short on substance. It just goes to show how intolerant the left is. Sadly the mind-numbed robots of Al Frankless are lapping this drivel up.
4,"Tell it how it is, Al!","At last, someone who exposes liars like Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity for what they are -- brainless (although clever!) liars! Al could've used a more aggressive editor, as sometimes he drones on a little too much, but for the most part, the book is chock full of laughs, sarcastic wit, and most importantly -- the truth!"
3,A Fair And Balanced Review,"Al Franken is a funny man. His wit and satire are extemely entertaining at times. Saturday Night Live was his venue, though. He, like many entertainers should stay in entertaining and not enter the political world. His writing style is alright in this book, like his nemesis Bill O'Reilly. He is sometimes funny in this book, but has such a hate-filled undertone that it makes it difficult to laugh. I don't understand why all the fuss over O'Reilly's picture on the book cover; but this book has been highly overrated and hyped. It is not worth the money...there is no useful, true information in it. Who cares about his opinion? This book will stop me from purchasing any of his other hatefully written books. I didn't buy the one about Rush Limbaugh JUST based on the hateful title mocking Rush's weight. Does Al think he's anything to look at? Bottom line, Al should stick to satire in the true sense of the word, like Dave Barry."
5,Fantastic!,"Al Franken is very comfortable with the idea that every white boy on TV who is proud of his heritage should be portrayed as a racist. He has embraced the conception that every Christian preacher who dares to show his or her face on the big screen, should be portrayed as a pervert and a racist. He feels a certain thrill and superiority, when every white boy who runs a fictional big business is portrayed by our entertainment industry as a pervert, a racist and a sexist.He is quite happy with the idea that a white boy is just someone to mock, laugh at and not take seriously, and hey, it shows."
3,Funny Satire; silly politics,Satire is so funny that I love it when well done - and that is Franken's forte - but as politics it's just another silly book. Giving this political heft along with lines of serious political commentators is really unfortunate. Franken promises humor and satire rich with wit and based on the latest trends in politics -- on that promise he delivers.
5,Right on Target and some sence of humor.,"Read half of the book on the first day and Al Franken proved to be more than a comedian. He has done a good job working with some hardvard students named as TeamFranken to research and study the facts before reveal it to millions of readers. Al should thank Fox News'law suit for the purchase of my 'LIES'. Great Job Al. Looking forward to seeing you on Tv in 'Franken Defactor' show head to head with ""O'lie,lly Factor""."
5,A Nice Relief in an Age of Lies and Distortions,"It is a huge relief to read something TRUE and WELL-WRITTEN when you are surrounded by the likes of Ann Coulter and Fox News. Franken does reveal important truths and lets the reader decide for themselves (in contrast to the news network that CLAIMS to report truth and foster independent decision). The book rings true throughout, and I have yet to see ANY rebuttal of the truths Franken reveals. How can these people get away with insulting, blatant lying?"
5,Franken Truth Serum,Humorous look at right wing talkers and the lies they tell. The book also looks seriously at the disaters imposed on the country by the Republican administration and Congress.
1,Huh?,"Did someone say information was give to Rice at least 8 months before 9/11? As in before Bush took office? During the Clinton presidency, right?"
3,Should have just been titled Lies,"It was a good read overall. The only point I have a problem with is using the same tools and methods described by Mr. Franken himself you could spin the facts he presents as well. As much as he slams Rush and Hannity for being on one side he approaches the opposite side with the same blind devotion.In their eyes Bush can do no wrong and the way Mr. Franken talks about Clinton you could almost picture Al following Bill around like a lost puppy.Both sides have issues and neither side is without a flaw, if anything I can thank both Rush and Mr. Franken for pushing me into seeking out a third party that is not simply a puppet with a different face."
1,"Why do we need a ""comedian""","Why is it that a ""factual"" attack is under the category ""satire"". The book reminds of late night comic routines - you get away with anything - complete offensive. Relevancy and insight is a sorry byproduct - suitable if you are a frustrated partisan that enjoys Hollywood humour."
5,FUNNY,"I have long disliked Bill O'Reilley's belligerence towards guests he disagreed with but when I started catching him in lies or exaggerations I just stopped watching him. I have never cared for Coulter or Hannity so I am not an unbiased reader. Nevertheless, Franken gives liberals some facts to support that gnawing gut feeling that these people are lying. As a political scientist I appreciate good research and Al Franken backs up his statements with substantial, credible research. And he does it with wit. Read and enjoy. I bought the audio cd so I could hear Franken's own emphasis but I will get a hard copy just so I can reread favorite parts, like O'Reilley expressing his displeasure over the picture used on the book's cover. ""This is what I look like!"" Too funny."
2,Humor that will please any fourth grade student,"Franken shows that he has little to offer, most of his so called ""facts"" that he displays from the General Accounting Office could be interpreted in a variety of ways due to the fact that they are so vague and open to interpretation.Anyone can take pot shots at leaders and debase their arguments by calling them pedantic childish names. It only reflects badly on the author. His humor fits a fourth grade classroom."
1,WWW.FRANKENLIES.COM,"WWW.FRANKENLIES.COM ... Judge for yourself who is telling the truth ... Will Franken issue an apology or retraction now that Bill O'Reilly has exhibited the actual deed / mortgage from his boyhood home, and it clearly says, ""Levittown, New York""?"
1,More Hate Speech,"This is just more hate speech that most often turns people away. If Franken had tried debating the issues instead of personal attacks against people for which he holds grudges, it may have been worth reading. As it is though, it is just useless waste of paper."
4,Well Done Franken,"After watching the most excited C-Span Book expo I think I've ever seen I had to go check out Franken's book, also promoted by the Fox Lawsuit. I expected a lot of humour but what is so underrated about Franken is how well his work is researched. ""Team Franken"" did an excellent job getting the facts out there for America to see. O'Reilly and Coulter beware! Franken is on your case!"
1,Give Al a pass,"Sure Al Franken gave us the line refering to money(Send it to me,Al Franken)But I think this time you should keep it in your pocket. If you believe in the ""right wing conspiracy"" or the ""Bush stole the election"" nonsense, then you will love thisbook. If you have a College degree, a private sector job, and a grip on reality, this book will just further your opinion of just how silly,angry,and irrational people can be if they don't get their way. I think AL may have inhailed too many fumes backstage on SNL."
1,What a joke,"Franken should have stuck to his comedy routine.. or maybe he is in this book? Misinformed, outright lies about the Bush administration.. amazing how people take him seriously? You'll find a better deal at the dollar store."
1,Just political propaganda,"Written for those that are incapable of independant thinking. The ""facts"" are not supported in any research I did but I suppose that if you believe in the tooth fairy and Easter bunny then this is the book for you.Not worth the read. Would rather clean out my garage."
1,Franni Franken is a big fat idiot and a nutcase,"Repulsive isn't it? Doesn't feel so good, does it Al Franken? But congratulations on your small-minded foray into the world of personal destruction. This is what Al Franken does. He talks about people and calls them names. Ann Coulter is a ""nutcase"". Bill O'Reilly is ""splotchy"". Yes, this liberal hero makes his living attacking people.Judging by many of the reviews here, it's absolutely incredible that people would regard him as some kind of liberal hero. I can't imagine anyone wanting to be associated with this loser who coats himself in slime. Ask yourself what kind of idiot would risk dragging his family into this arena of mudslinging and ad hominem attacks?Al Franken sold his soul. What goes around comes around."
1,The truth is at WWW.FRANKENLIES.COM,Those of you who give 5-star reviews would best be served finding out if Franken actually got his facts right! Check out www.frankenlies.com ... Franken and his 14 Harvard researchers did not do any better than his targets.
3,Better Than Most of Its Ilk,"I consider myself a conservative, but in trying to keep an open mind about things, I read books from the ""other side"" from time to time. I read ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right"" by Al Franken. Even though I agreed with only about 20% of what he wrote, the book was well written and funny at times. I think Mr. Franken communicated the message he set out to convey. This book is much better than the more venomous books of Michael Moore."
5,"Go Al, Go!","This book gave me great pleasure. After suffering all the hype, hyperbole and downright distortion that spews from the right wing-dominated media (admit it, Fox fans!), Al Franken does a straight-forward, fact-based dissection of a sampling the lies from Coulter, Savage, et al. This book is now making the rounds to other members of my family, who are equally delighted."
5,The Left strikes back,"I have been an admirer of Franken for some time, so I went into this book with high expectations. He and his team of researchers met those expectations. His book seems very well researched, although I honestly did not bother to do any further research to check out his footnotes. His book is even funnier than Bushwacked. I sincerely hope his book and the Ivin's Dubose book begin the avalanche that results in the defeat of Dubya come November '04"
2,Angry Al,I have read both LIES and Bill O'Reilly's new book and have come to the conclusion that Bill O'Reilly wrote a book about his views and that Franken wrote a book about how he doesn't like O'Reilly or his network. I think O'Reilly will be more successful in converting readers to his philosophy than Franken will be in making readers HATE a president they already won't vote for or not watch a cable news network they already don't watch.
1,sure....,"""Factcheck.org has a good analysis of this book. To paraphrase, it is obviously biased but factually correct""Factcheck has no such anlysis. Never did."
1,lies and the lying liars who tell them,"It is hard for me to believe that this book was published. The information contained therein is personal bias,innuendo, rumor and conjecture written with venom and a poison pen. Franken is what's wrong with politics today. Classic example of the pot calling the kettle black."
3,Funny but typical,"With the backing of the Shorenstein Center, I expected a little more from Al... There's not much you can't find out with 15 Harvard kids doing your research. But Harvard or not, schools can't put facts into context. That takes experience and real analysis. Otherwise more facts just become more data to confuse the issue. I expected some real analysis from Al but got the same vitriolic diatribe that I get from Coulter, Hannity or O'Reilly. Complain as he does about them, he's doing the same thing. I was disappointed by that. That being said, it's still a pretty good book. It's flat out funny and cleverly written. Franken brings up some great points that the conservatives need to look at. But tultimately, this is a ""preaching to the choir"" book. Because of its tone, it won't make any converts and that's a shame because it could have been so much more."
5,Good Job!,"The reader is drawn to this conclusion by sound research and analysis of the facts that are freely and readily available to the public. Mr.Franken listened to what the self-described experts had to say on the various issues constantly hurled to the American public from the various media outlets, thenchecked the facts behind the statements and pointed out some glaring lies spewed forth by Hannity, O&#65533;Reilly, and Coulter to name a few.This book is to-the-point and is an enjoyable read. I&#65533;ve laughed out loud at least once in each chapter. It is a valuable tool to those of us who have been alienated by the direction in which the country has been dragged."
2,Mildly funny.,"This book is already very dated. Mildy amusing, very insular view on American political to-ing and fro-ing as to why the Democrats and liberal types are the civilised choice and why the Republicans and right wing media types are full of it and homourless....supposedly. He targets Bill O'Reilly, Bush and Rush Limbaugh, hardly very difficult. If you don't read the American media and watch Fox constantly you'll be left high and dry. Lots of stunts and gags throughout, like when Franken sends his son to hassle people in a Christian college who believe different things than he does. He includes his own Liberal lies and myths eg: Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. Ultimately it's all partisan politics regardless of which side you're on."
1,A Leftist Spin Doctors Fantasy,"If you were looking for a book that tells the ""truth"" about the lies of the right, well all I can say is this book isn't where you'll find them. So many distortions and spinning to make everything reported look plausible. A great book for the uneducated, mind numb robots on the left who believe anything written as long as it fits their agenda. The author was better and more believeable as Stuart Smally on SNL."
4,Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look,"Good book.....Should get this one, Interesting read. Give it as gifts and your friends will appreciate the present. FOUR STARS"
3,Informative...But Repetative,"Franken's book outlines numerous ways in which the far-right have twisted words or outright lied to suit their political agenda. Franken goes into excruciating detail on everyone from Sean Hannity right on up the ladder to George W. Bush himself. The most poignant chapter in the book is Franken's one page chapter on our ""National Dialogue on Terrorism"". In this brief chapter, Franken, in a pseudo-conversation of alternating quotes brings to the forefront the far-right's presumed view on concepts like terror, patriotism, and freedom. Overall, Franken brings up many strong, well-researched points, but if the book has a downside it's that Franken is overly repetative, and at times incessant getting his point across. I've got it Al, these people are liars."
3,Funny As Expected. But Also Disappointing.,"As if we needed another book to reinforce the contempt partisans hold for each other. Admittedly, the book is funny. But, in terms of contributing to anything useful in the political realm, the book is about as effective as the rhetoric that comes from the likes of Ann Coulter and others who poison the well for profit. Of course, Franken can get away with his brand of vitriol by labeling it ""sarcasm,"" ""analysis"" or ""satire."" But, the impact on public discourse is the same - it further polarizes ideologues and turns the majority of moderate Americans off."
5,As Funny as it is Frightening,"I have never read a book by Franken before, though I have been a long time fan of his work with Saturday Night Live. As with doubtless numerous others customers, the media hype generated by the Fox suit encouraged me to buy this book. In sum, I devoured it rapidly, and hung on every word. Funnier, and with better fact-checking than Michael Moore (with the help of TeamFranken) this book details the many lies propogated by the radical right, and all-too-blithely disseminated by our lazy, ineffectual media. Franken alternates between humorous tidbits, biting satire and devastating research that picks apart the lies told by the likes of Ann (Thrax) Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and everyone's favorite right-wing blowhard, Rush Limbaugh. I recommend this book to everyone who needs a break from the all-too-serious political season that is upon us, and who nonetheless wants to get it all straight, sift through the hype, and see what's going on in our society."
5,Witty and smart,"The benefit of having someone like Al Franken throw his hat into the perpetual shouting match between liberals and conservatives is that, in Mr. Franken's case, he's actually entertaining to read, whether you agree with him or not.The book is well-researched, and his exposure of some shoddy research methods done by right-wing commentators/authors to back their belies is revealing of a disturbing trend we're seeing in journalistic standards, from all sides."
5,Elucidatingly Delightful!,"My word Al, you've bowled some columbine with this tome. When I think of all those conservatives just simply boiling in their own beet-root-vegetable broth, I really have to think of that wonderful comment all my friends and I have been hearing out there on the party circuit, ""It's time to take the old trolley back to the museum on this one."" Bravo, Al! Bravissimo!!!"
4,"Very entertaining, but the bashing gets to be a little much.","I'm a 100% left wing liberal, but even I got sick of the constant conservative-bashing. I realize the pendulum swings both ways, but if you want a book that will actually convince people of the errs of the hardcore conservatives, use facts, not cheap shots. Although this book was very fun, and highly entertaining, and actually gave quite a few facts, they were somewhat undermined by Franken's name-calling. All in all, though, it was a very entertaining read."
5,A Taste of Bittersweet Humor,"Well, 4.5 stars really, but I am a strong believer in rounding up.I really love this book and Al Franken is a funny guy. He delivers his points well, especially in the first half of the book. He uses humor, of course being a comedian, to present his opinions. This is an effective technique for those who disagree with most left wing stances off the bat. Lowering their defenses, if you may. The only thing that I did not like about Al Franken is that sometimes he is insensitive towards the people on the right, even if they deserve it. This doesn't happen very often though, mostly standing out when he confronts the former first lady in a Michael Moorish kind of way. Other than that, his agruements are well presented as well as documented.And I am looking forward to reading his newest book."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air,"A witty and poignant answer to the extreme right wing propoganda of people like Coulter, O'Reilly, Limbaugh, and Hannity. Franken's sense of humor is what makes him so much more palatable than the aforementioned ranters and ravers. When he gets into some name calling he descends to their level, but for the most part the book is brilliant, funny, and fun to read."
3,The reader reviews - predictable!,"I can't stop laughing about the reader reviews for this book - they're so predictable! With a very few exceptions by thoughtful readers, the reviews are all either one star (indignant conservatives with no sense of humor) or five stars (gleeful liberals hugging themselves with joy). As such, the star rating system for these 1200+ reviews is meaningless. However, the number of responses alone is enough to tell you that it's worth reading, if only to see what all the fuss and feathers is about."
1,14 Harvard Grad Students and a Third-Rate Comedian,"All these glaring reviews leave out a very important fact: Franken had at his disposal 14 Harvard grad students to research & write as much of the book as he wanted. As David Horowitz has pointed out, Franken & co. make much about the so-called advantage conservatives have from large think-tanks. However, liberals have much larger think tanks at their disposal, namely the Ivy League (and most other) schools. Anyone think Harvard will be ""fair and balanced"" and offer, say, Ann Coulter 14 grad students for her next book? Nope, Harvard is no more fair and balanced than Franken or his book."
1,Back Stabbed!,"I was really excited when this book came out. I read the reviews and went out and bought the book. I read the entire book in several days and set out to set the conservatives straight. I found myself that in every arguement I brought up that all Franken had done was leave out one or two small but critical details which left me high and dry every time. In the end I feel the Franken played me for a fool and now I look sillier then ever. This book is like an emotional drug. You will feel super good while reading it, but when you go to apply it, you find out that you have been the victim of an incredible hoax and will just fall flat on your face. We would have been better off if Fox would have won that lawsuit."
1,I give this rotting piece of cow tripe zero stars,"Al Franken--wholly unqualified to even speak about world affairs, foreign policy and politics. I read this garbage out of curiosity, pretty sure that I would find Franken all blowhole and no teeth. I was right. I keep coming across these supposed entertainers who have about as much knowledge about politics and foreign policy as a cockroach has about fixing a car transmission. You don't see George Bush telling Hollywood how to make movies, so why can these liberal windbags keep their pie holes shut? All Franken is a trash writer with no remote idea of how the world works and the complexities of foreign policy. Pure drivel."
1,"Got a ""1"" cause there ain't Zero.","Just makes you glad that idiots like this don't run the country. He is yesterday's news, living in memory of Monica, Bill and Hillary, An era where all respect went out the door with the White House china and silverware. It has one redeeming value -makes good fuel for the cabin cookstove next winter!"
1,What is Good and what is not.,"If you want something funny with a Liberal and anti-conservative point of view this book is a great read. Although it is not likely to change anyones mind, it does provide insight and another point of view.What makes this a bad book is that Franken again takes a conservative and uses them to sell his book. First with ""Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot"" using Limbaughs name to sell books, and now using Democrats and Fox News' Bill O'riellys distorted picture on the cover. Lets face it, the vast majority of those who will read this are not learning anything new, and Franken even admits that he took the work of Alterman, then added humor and called it his own. No objective sources makes it Ideological... so to add the tagline ""A fair and balanced look at the right"" isn't satire, its Propaganda."
2,When to Laugh When to Cry,"This book was at times very amusing. If it wasn't for 9-11 I suppose it would have been funnier. It's just the image of those poor people falling to their death and the non-visible ones crushed and/or burned under the World Trade Center collapse that keeps coming in my mind when I read political discourse like this.Making light of ""wacky"" liberal hijinks would be funny if the end result didn't end up hurting so many many people. Mr Franken needs to distinguish between entertainment and governance."
5,Truth: The Natural Enemy of the GOP,"Anyone who reads Al Franken's book will know very quickly the real reason FOX (Facts Optional and X-tra) tried to keep it off of the shelves: it is full of FACTS, and no [one] can refute them.Al Franken shows through FACTS, not right wing (or left wing) hype, that the parties in question lie like most people breath -they just assume that their audience is too stupid (and with FOX viewers they're usually right) to catch them at it.When they they are caught, they just try to bully their opposition and accuse them of 'hating America'.The conservatives can't hunt Communists any more, so they label anyone who dosen't agree with their agenda a 'Liberal', even though no conservative can actually define what a Liberal is. Count me in that group if the alternative is the lies and hypocracies exposed in this book."
2,Too Left For Me!!,"Al Franken is a smart guy and he is right that the Fox News is a biased right-wing organization. He is right about alot of things. But like Ann C. is to the right, he is too much a left winger. People like him and Ann, don't represent this country and neither offers any real solutions to make America better. All you get is name calling and finger pointing to the other side. While he makes some good points, he needs needs to show some common sense in his opinions. He has alot of good ideas, but no one will take him serious unless he moves to the center."
2,More Misses than Hits,"To his credit, Franken does a decent job of pointing out the foibles of Anne Coulter and Co. But then again, just how hard is it to find inaccuracies, half-truths, lies and worse in the rantings of zealots like Coulter and Co.? Unfortunately, Franken misses the larger issue, which is that public discourse in America is increasingly dominated by zealots of right and left, and Ivins, Moore, Hightower and their ilk play just as loose with facts and are just as ideologically driven as their right wing counterparts. So unfortunately Franken misses a nice trick by focusing on the blatant stupidity of his political and cultural enemies, and ends up merely preaching to the choir instead of capitalizing on the opportunity to examine a problem of real urgency, which is the increasingly fundamentalist character of America, or rather, of two competing Americas."
1,The only one lying is Franken,Mixed of truths and out right lies make up the bulk of this book.Don't waste your time. Does anyone have any flipflops?
1,Hypocrisy Was Never Funnier,"From frankenlies(dot)com:On page 110 of Lies, Franken writes that Barton Gellman of the Washington Post wrote that Clinton's was the ""first administration to undertake a systematic anti-terrorist effort."" Well, an informative website called spinsanity.org looked into this, and they found that this line in Gellman's article is actually from a quote by Clinton buddy and former National Security Advisor Sandy Berger.1Franken's lie may not seem like much of a big deal, except this is the kind of thing which Franken pummels Ann Coulter for supposedly doing in her books. Hypocrisy, anyone? And what about those 14 Harvard researchers? They must have been on spring break during this one.__________________Notes:1 ""Franken's Satirical Lies,"" Bryan Keefer, spinsanity.org, September 12, 2003, http://www.spinsanity.org/post.html?2003_09_07_archive.html."
1,This explains the years that SNL lost the quality....,"Pitiful attempt at weak humor filled with grossly unsupported ""Facts"".This explains the years that SNL lost it's quality and integrity of honest entertainment and solid humor.This man is a pitiful, spite filled looser, that can't stand another view, other than his own elitist babble.Save your money, don't buy Franken or Limbaugh.Invest in a bridge... it's a FAR better bet!"
1,Demented Former Comic,"I actually liked this clown when he was just doing comedy but his forays into politics are mind-bogglingly inane. I would review this book but I can't bring myself to buy or read this waste of a tree. However, I have heard enough of his frothing at the mouth to get the gist. I appreciate his right to speak his mind (?) but I also reserve my right not to be subjected to his lunatic spewings."
1,another liberal trash,"Along with his slanderous ""big fat idiot"" title directed to Rush Limbaugh, I wouldn't mind calling him an extremely retarded and morally degraded skunk. His work is seldom substantiated and tend to have this liberal biases that everyone in the right is lying. I believe that without the media coverage, his book would probably sink to the bottom of the bestseller's list. He is uneducated, opportunistic, sneaker and an extremely bad writer.I hope everyone reading his books would later on wash their brain with epsom salt to clean out the filth."
5,"The truth will set you free, + make you laugh and think!!!","My interest in this book was peaked when I heard that Fox and Bill O'Reilly were going to sue Al Franken. I wanted to know what all of the hoopla was about. I read this book, loved it, and have personally given away 9 copies to friends and family. It's that good, it's that thought provoking, it's that funny!! Al Franken is a master at highlighting what is wrong with the right. I loved every single word in that book and if I could, I would give a copy to everyone that I know. You go, Al!! I can't wait to read your next one. Keep em coming!"
1,"Talk about lies, Al Franken lies throughout this book","What a poorly written book. I must say for a man accussing everybody of lies, he should really look at his own book. Its Al Franken who lies and slanders throughout his whole book."
2,An unbias review..,"I happen to agree with everything Franken has to say, but at the same time I found this book somewhat repetative and boring. He states more and more lies by the right, which are interesting at first, but get tiresome after about half the book. If you are very liberal(like myself) you will often be frustrated by the facts presented in this book and I think I would rather read and Ann Coulter book and think about how crazy she is, then hear propoganda from my own side."
1,Angry Leftist buffoon spouts off again,"Don't bother with this garbage. If it's anything like his previous annoyingly whiny diatribes, it's just more mind-melting liberal gobbity gook designed to derail the massive conservative momentum of the last decade. Mr Franken is SO upset that American voters have given the GOP the majority in both Houses of Congress, the nations' Governors mansions AND the White House that his angry liberal rhetoric is at an all time screeching high. Don't give this guy any encouragement. Buy Bill O'Reilly's book instead...much better reading !"
1,Hypocritical,"I also noticed some inconsistencies in some of Frankens comments.For instance, he says that O'Reilly compared the Koran to Mein Kampf when really, he compared making Americans read the Kuran to the hypothetical situation of making Americans reading Mein Kampf during World War II. There is a difference.He also writes that O'Reilly is talented. I saw him a few nights ago on Conan O'Brien where he said that the reason O'Reilly doesn't do USO tours is because O'Reilly has no talent. I imagine Franken would say this is just an example of his satirical style but it appears that he is disingenuous in his attempts to not be as politically simple as he accuses his targets of being.I wonder what Franken actually covers in his USO tours. I find it hard to believe that the commentary in this book would be very well recieved by US troops. And if the material he chooses for these tours is different, isn't that a kind of lie as well? And, in that case, what is his motivation to do the tours at all?"
1,rush sucks! don't compare al f. to rush.,"al may not be on an atkins diet, but he is nowhere near fat idiot!"
3,Good (ish)?,"As a Brit, who has a limited knowledge of US political commentators (I've never been to the US), I quite enjoyed the book. What I find slightly bizarre is how Al Franken et al are supposed to be so left wing. In Europe he would rate as a centrist. I don't know if US political culture is just very right wing or European culture very left wing, but the whole political scene is different.We certainly don't have the type of radio, tv commentators as Rush or Anne - politics isn't dealt with in quite as an aggressive way apart from in the print media. Anyway it all looks very entertaining from the outside. Only in America........."
5,Franken for President,"Franken's fabulous wit makes the horrors of the Bush administration easier to digest. I would've sobbed throughout this book if Franken hadn't made me laugh. As a citizen of this country, it is your duty to read this."
1,Lies and the Lying liar who wrote this book,This book is the biggest peice of garabage ever written. Al Franken has no clue of what the truth really is and only tries to be an attention graber. Don't waste your time reading this.
1,Thank God He Cleared that up...,"So according to Al, all conservatives are liars and all liberals are not. What rubbish. Franken should stick to being Stuart Smally. Oh, but I forgot, there is much more money writing left wing political diatribes than making more bad movies. Franken certainly doesn't improve the quality of the current politcal discourse. A thinking person should pass on this dreck."
1,Comedy or Slander,I'm continually amazed at the lengths to which people on the extreme fringes of a political ideology will go to support thier cause. I would love for all the LIES Al mentions in this book to be proven rather than innuendo or suspect or word play.
1,This book is awful,"Al Franken must be the real liar here. Using deception to get John Ashcroft to give him fodder for his book. Al Franken lies and is a lying liar who tells them. This is an unfair and biased ad hominen attack on President Bush and the Republican party. If you like reading mindless drivel then read this book. If you want to read something intellectually stimulating, read Hannity's book."
2,Mildly entertaining piece of hack work,"Al Franken is mildly funny, but it has to be admitted that he is not an intellectual (aka, someone to be taken seriously). He also presents a sort of wimpy American-style liberalism. If you want the real thing, read some Chomsky and go eat lunch with Vanessa Redgrave. This is the liberal version of Ann Coulter's ""Treason"", with the same diatribes and parallel verbage. Don't waist your money!"
2,"Humorous, but....","Just because things are funny does not make them accurate. Al Franken as well as Ann Coulter are guilty of the same problem; they use humor and insults in an attempt to make people see their point. That's fine if you are writing for sheer entertainment value, not so much if serious political commentary is your goal. Mr. Franken may be a very talented writer and a somewhat smart guy, that, however, does not mean he has a clue as to how this country should be handled. If you are looking for a comedic look at politics, read this book. For those of you who are looking for serious political commentary, look elsewhere."
1,Why the name-callin?,"I won't as much as pick up this book, sounds like-smells like a lot of speculative bashing and reading into things that aren't really worth getting into! I second the nomination of impeachment of one William Jefferson Clinton! Godspeed!"
1,There is so much better...,"This is a simple pass. It was a general waste of time, rehashing the same material. There are other new works far better, with less rhetoric. Pass."
3,It's okay,If you like Al Franken then you will probably like this book. It has some funny moments. Overall it's like everything that politics has become a rehash of he said she said. Yeah I already know that the commentators on Fox News present out right lies as the truth. The title should have been an alert to the type of book this was going to be but I thought there would been more of a backstory about the lies and th epeople involved. I guess I was looking to come away from the book with a better understanding of why not just who.
3,A bit disappointing,"Generally, I like Al Franken. I liked his book, ""Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot."" Although this book had the same themes, it was far more emotional, subjective, and vitriolic in its tone, and that detracted from the credibility of his case. The book wasn't even humorous - just angry and bitter.I was particularly interested in the chapter on O'Reilly - a pundit who deservedly draws fire and should get out of the kitchen if he can't stand the heat. But what should have been strong writing quickly dissolved into petty name-calling that certainly wasn't worth the cost of the book.I highly recommend Peter Hart's ""The Oh Really Factor"" instead. The book carries a similar theme to Franken's but the case is much better presented. The humor is more indirect, smarty, sly and edgy: something I expected in Franken's book and just didn't find."
2,support frame,this is so easy to assemble but falls apart very easily. nothing a little duct tape didnt fix. it does a great job and breaks down for easy storage. great price and recieved it fast.
4,In a perfect world......,"In a perfect world, this would have made headlines. ""Rodney Crowell's big return on a major label!!"" It would have went platinum. It would have featured 4 or 5 number one singles. He and Trisha Yearwood would have dueted on ""I Don't Fall in Love So Easy"" on the CMA awards show.But back to reality. This cd went nowhere. You really can't even find it in bargain bins, I don't think that many copies were even pressed.This cd features what you would expect on a Rodney Crowell album. A full linup of original songs along with a classic cover thrown in for good measure, and fantastic playing.If you can find this recording, get it, and enjoy what everyone else is missing."
5,The WHOLE history of Halloween,"As someone who has always loved Halloween, this book is a must have. After seeing, ""The Haunted History of Halloween"" on the History Channel, I went out and bought this book. It is by far the best book I have found that tells the whole history behind the holiday that we celebrate every October 31. From the ancient festivities of Samhain to the parties thrown by Victorians to parades in the 30's and 40's, this book explores the significance behind this holiday. Why do we trick or treat and dress up? Why are ghosts, witches, black cats, and devils associated with this holiday. This book answers these questions and a lot more."
1,A very poor badly reasoned work,"There is much to think about here, but the author is so carried away by their own biases they misread evidence."
1,The Indus Valley civilisation was made by Dravidians,"Anyone who looks at a person from Tamilnadu in the south and a person from Uttar Pradesh in the north can tell that 'India' is not made up of one racial type. 'Aryans' live in the north, the further north the more pure, and 'Dravidians' in the south, the further south the more pure blooded. There was an Aryan invasion, saying otherwise is merely reactionary nonsense, designed to undermine the achievements of the Dravidian people."
2,Complicated,I enjoyed reading this book although I can't really say what I got out of it. The philosophies were difficult for me to grasp and I really did not come away understanding more about Eastern Philosophy.I am going to try a few others.
4,one giant leap...,"LEGIT is an important film for many reasons. It is proof that Chicago is an under-utilized location for film making. Not only is this great city a beautiful backdrop, it also provides a huge pool of talent from writers and actors to DPs and makeup artists. LEGIT delivers on every one of these aspects. It takes its viewers through the sometimes gorgeous, sometimes gritty, streets of Chicago and has some really terrific performances by all Chicago-based actors. A stellar performance is given by Norm Boucher as the power-hungry Joey Moran. His portrayal of a man slowly losing his power and his mind is captivating to watch. Angie Schoofs is enthralling as Billie. Her smooth vocals and sex appeal make her nightclub numbers something to remember. The nightclub scenes were some of my favorites with exciting numbers by Schoofs and beautiful, peacock feather-clad dancers. Anyone that wants to support Chicago film making in all its forms should take a look at LEGIT."
5,"A LEGIT ""HIT""","This is a MUST for any Action/Drama/Suspense Fan. Reminded me of""Cotton Club"" meets ""Chicago""...I will own my own copy of this DVD and recommend it to all of my Friends!Filmed in one of the greatest cities in the World: Chicago, IL.Great job guys!!!!"
3,Size too big,"I ordered several Medium size T-Shirts, fabric is good, quality is good, but size is actually closer to Large. There are noticeable size difference between different T-Shirts - Gildan are the biggest, Anvlil close to Gildan, and Haynes more true to size than others."
4,"""Great album""",I particularly like this album having not heard much of pollyanna previous work. I remember when I first heard the album the opening track anchored just stayed in my head for ages I love that cruzy background rythm guitar with the soft touch of the keyboard brilliant. The album itself is well paced out getting into classic rock tunes particular people and definitely my favourite firesale absolutely rocks there are only really two tracks on the album that have a bit of a down fall but on the whole it is definitely an album worth having in the collection.
2,JAZZ MUSIC BLOCK,THE TUNES ARE VERY SHORT AND DO NOT START UP IMMEDIATELY WHEN BLOCK IS TURNED OR BANGED ON.
5,"Beautiful to look at, hard to solve.","Another masterwork of collage art this book is a conundrum indeed. If you like the artwork of Bantock and fancy yourself a modern day Sherlock Holmes this is the book for you. Fair warning, you're gonna need a Watson."
1,Cautiverio de disco,"Este Chayanne no es el de siempre.No me gusta nada, parece que se sienta mayor para bailar, al contrario de los temas de su anterior disco Sincero, comoCaprichosa, que nos encantó a todos.Debe volver a contar con compositores que le den ritmo y alegría al cuerpo."
1,¿Qué le pasa a Chayanne?,"Claro que le debe pasar algo, perdió frescura, cree que le puede dar cualquier cosa a su fanaticada sin más..yo pensaba que Chayanne iba a bailar mas y los temas iban a ser mas pegadizos , después del buenísimo Sincero nominado al Grammy, pero la verdad es que aunque lo he escuchado con cariño no me ha convencido nada para que lo recomiende, el anterior era la bomba pero este ni enamora ni me convence."
3,U must let the new Chayanne grow on you...,This cd has a 'rockero' egde to it. The songs that stand out to me are the ballads. My favorite is 02: No Te Preocupes Por Mi. I must admit this is NOT my favorite Chayanne cd but the more I listen to it the more I like it. Give it some time.
4,an ok book,"aight this book was ok and i'm glad star has a 2nd chance and all but isnt it about time something went Wrong with christina that wasnt fixed by the end of the book? she goes to montana with star to get lyssa to help. lyssa tries to help, chris is a whimp. thats the whole backgroud to this series lately. i mean think about it. they take star away she gets him back in the next book. star gets sick, star gets better but hes a grump. star goes to montana and gets lost, christina finds star and it ends all happy. enough already! Melanie on the other hand has all kinds of problems but works hard to solve them Herself not by whining to mike and ashleigh. the book overall was ok and kinda funny when star got lost. you cant really worry when u know everythings gonna be ok cuz it always is with christina right. so my opinion is read the book, like the book, but hope that the next one on christina will be better."
5,Every bit Anointed,"Some Christians still don't know how to Experience GOD. Let the Bible help you. Passages concerning Prayer, Faith, Healing, the HOLY GHOST and the Presence of GOD are highighted through the Bible and in the back there's a journal section for your experiences with each. Want my advice, get it and have yoursel a blast with the HOLY GHOST. Nothing mean or freaky about the HOLY GHOST. He's all class even though He's all fun and games."
4,"Dominoes--are these ""seconds""?","When using this particular domino set,we noticed that several of the dominoes were not as thick as the rest of the set. Could this be a set that did not pass inspection and is being sold as a ""second""? The colors of the pips are also different (darker)from other sets of dominoes we have. If this is a ""seconds"" set of dominoes, it should be labeled as such so that the buyer knows there will be imperfections."
3,Great games,"Only negative I give this version of the game is that it only comes with four trains. :/ I need at least six, if not eight!!!"
1,Missing parts,Don't buy it. it was missing parts & I had to return it for a refund. I wound up purchasing dominoes from Target.
3,Cardinal Double 12 Color Dot Mexican Train Dominoes in Tin,"Took two or three tries to get a complete set that wasn't marked in some fashion on the back side of the tiles. We finally got a ""clean"" set and are very pleased."
3,Good enough,"These are nice enough dominoes for the price. Tin was slightly damaged, although still works and the center piece for the train game was broken but still usable."
5,Excelent theorical analisys of matery,This is one of few books what really help to student and experts to unsdertand the nature of the matery.
5,"Really, The Very Best","Not only is the music timeless and thoroughly entertaining, but the recording is excellent. All of your favourite Herman's Hermits songs are there, from 'Mrs. Brown, You've Got A Lovely Daughter', to ""I'm Henry the VIII, I Am"", plus 23 more delightful tunes. You'll defintely be singing along."
2,Not made in Korea,"I ordered two blankets from these people they were suppoese to be the Korean Blankets made in Korea instead I get some knock off made in china. One of the bad things about the ones made in chia is they stink, they smell like they were soaked in petro. I will never buy from these guys again, they need to advertise what they have instead of saying one thing and then selling you a cheap knock off."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book for Dr. Norman's class at the University of California, Riverside. I must say that this is one of the worst textbooks I've ever read. It is confusing, unorganized and the charts and diagrams are difficult to understand. It tries to be comprehensive but fails to clearly explain most concepts. The only thing worse than this book are Dr. Norman's lectures. There are plenty of other better books on this topic than this one."
2,You've gotta be kidding me.,"First let me state, yeah, I got suckered into buying this book because I am a fan of Forever Knight and Nigel Bennett. I previewed a chapter of the book and thought, ""Okay. Sounds interesting enough."" Man, was I wrong. Cliche ""to the max"". The characters were one dimensional and the story was completely transparent. The plot had holes in it big enough to drive a Mack truck through! Although I will give it credit for some ingenuity in combining Celtic mythology/vampirism/Arthurian legend/with a dash of lycanthropy for flavor. That was an interesting brew. But,nevertheless, take my advice, Mr. Bennett, and stick to acting and mouthing other people's words."
1,Not nearly as good as Elrod alone,"At one point in the book the evil bad guy, Charon, points out the many shortcomings of this book's hero, and all of it is true. Richard is over a thousand years old and was a champion fighter even before he acquired superhuman powers, but a drunken lout can whip his ass with no trouble. He is incompetent, boorish, not especially bright, and unscrupulous; and his vampire ""mother"" Lady Sabra is even more repellent--for instance she uses a human sacrifice for Richard's first feeding.The writing is bad, the period flavor of the period bits unconvincing (King Arthur tends to lead to problems of anachronism, but it could have been handled better) and the characters, ""good"" and bad alike, repulsive. This is far below the excellent standard Elrod achieves on her own."
3,I admit I got because Nigel Bennett helped write it....,"Once I read it, however, it was vampire porn. It's very gritty and truly not for the faint of heart. It's not for the Sparkly Vampire Lovers (insert 'Twilight Saga' here) on your list. But if you like your vamps ugly, bloody and really looking for serious hardcore sex - this may be the book for you."
5,The Best Office Reference Guide,"This book was required reading for a college course; however, had I found the book on my own I would have felt I struck gold! How 9 is the tool to keep right on your desk...allowing you to either learn or refresh skills from grammer and punctuation to proper format of an email correspondence or business letter."
3,Good value for the price!,"This is product is very good for the price, but it does have a limited selection of prepopulated card content."
2,Not enough covereage,"I have bought and loved several other Glamorise bras, so when I wanted a sports bra I got this one. I can not wear it, beacuse the lack of coverage under the arms drives me crazy. The rest of it seems ok, but it is hard for em to tell when I feel like I am too loose on the sides."
4,"Love it, but itchy...","I ordered two of these bras in different colors. I love the fit and lift that I get (48 years-old, 38DD). Unfortunately, I sent the one I had not yet worn back due to the fabric causing me to itch. I do not have sensitive skin and have never had this problem with any other bras, but there is something in the fabric that drives me crazy!! I kept one of them because I had worn it and washed it hoping that it would help, but it didn't. Apart from the itchy fabric, this bra is comfortable enough to wear everyday. It is not hot and gives great lift and support."
4,Great summer bra,"This is the ONLY bra I will wear in the summer because of it's moisture wicking ability, especially from under the breasts. The size runs a little smaller than stated. if you are a 42 ,then the clasps will be on the last set and still be rather tight."
2,Sizing is way off,"I had high hopes for this bra, but unfortunately, it appears their sizing is way off. I have been measured several times and have worn a 34D for 10+ years. The band on this bra was HUGE - it fit more like a 36 or bigger. The cups had an odd shape that was very unflattering, and were too thin - the 'headlights' would definitely show through. It was so big that if offered no support at all. I returned it!"
3,Glamorise Women's Full Figure Bra,"It was too much bra for me...and I think the size didn't fit. But, I kept one and sent one back!"
3,Best Fitting Sports Bra,"This is the most supportive sports bra I've ever owned. I am a DD cup, and finding sports bras that are in expensive that actually give support is very difficult. This bra delivers. I'm even back into jogging."
3,"Supportive, but uncomfortable","I followed others' advice and sized up (two band sizes, since I vary by brand). This bra still barely fit on the last hook. And, it was so scratchy and uncomfortable. It feels like it was knitted from fishing line.I bought these as a possible daily wear bra, but the ""v"" came up almost to my collarbone, even with the straps let out and the band pulled down. Unless I wear a turtle neck or crew neck the bra would show.I'm giving it three stars, since it probably would hold everything in place for working out, if I could stand to have it on that long."
2,way too small,I'm sure this would be a good sports bra if it fit but it was way too small. I ordered it in the same size I have worn for a number years in numerous brands but it was at least one full size too small.
4,SNUG!,"Previously, I had ordered four of a different style Glamorise bra. These were fantastic & provided the support I needed & relieved the stress put on my arthritic back. I felt the sports bra would help me even more, but it is much too small, not only around the chest but especially the cups, even though the same size was ordered & received. I cannot wear them."
2,size run small,the sizes run small if you wear a 38DDD then you need to order a 40DDD or 44DDD other than that it is a great bra
2,Turns normal breasts into pointy cones,"I really like theGlamorise Women's No Bounce Full Support Sport Braand I was hoping this would be similar, but without the cami front. This bra is not flattering at all. The cups shape my breasts into such an unnatural cone shape that I drew stares and comments from my friends on the one occasion that I wore it. I like the wire-free lift, but I just can't wear the bra in public."
3,Not sure about it,"I just got the bra today, haven't decided if I'm keeping it yet. You definitely want to go up at least 1 size. From reading the other reviews, I decided to go up a cup size & a band size. The band is very snug & the cups are small, the center doesn't lie flat. It supports better than the average sports bra, but there is still bounce, I think if the cups fit better it would be more supportive. It seems well made & I think it would hold up to frequent wearings & washings."
1,They try way too hard to sound original,"If this CD was only made up of one disc, I would give a star or two, but two discs full of live performances is just too much for any music fan to handle. The lead singer tries to hard to change the flows of the songs from the studio recordings, and he does fairly good job. But overall, he fails to bring a quality sound. If you need 2 boring CD's just to play while you sleep at night, get this one (it will put you to sleep right away), otherwise it will just collect more dust on your CD tower."
1,Horrible,"If there were zero stars, this CD would definetly deserve it. I am not exactly sure what Counting Crows attempted with this CD... I mean, it's not like they have 6 or 7 albums out there, or like they are already established ""big rock band."" Just because they made it on the cover of the Rolling Stone magazine, it doesn't mean that they can knock down anything in their way. I mean, common, even Spice Girls made it on the cover. First disc is OK, just OK. But on the second disc, it seems like the singer himself is bored with the lyrics and lame music. He attempts to put some life into it, but it falls even shorter then that. I have pushed myself to listen the 2nd disc till the end just so I could write this review.... In order to warn other people: THIS CD IS NOT WORTH EVEN $1. Stick with their other 2 CD's, because these guys are no Dave Matthew's Band. 1/2 stars out of 5."
4,Solid Live Performances from the Crows,"The eternal debate with this crows live double disc will be whether it is a good thing that the crows have changed the songs around, including the rythym and the melodies. The problem for old crows fans will be hearing their favorite songs ""butchered"". If you are familiar with the songs this can be quite a problem. However, the songs on the electric disc stay more faitfully with the originals, and the songs on storytellers while erratic, are sporadically beautiful and more effective than the album versions. Not every rearrangement works, but it is still a solid piece of work and a testament to the crows not sticking to the same thing over and over again. This CD is certainly not for everyone, but for people who are open to hearing altered versions of the songs, certainly worthwhile."
5,Very beautiful collection!,"If you want to buy a good sally oldfield's collection (easy to find!) you can buy this cd. Mirrors, Mandala, Morning Of My Life, it seems that contains all of Sally's hit. If you don't know nothing by Sally you can start with this collection. If you like Sally buy it to have always a cd with the best commercial songs. If you are a Sally's collector you can't miss it!"
1,"Canadian who loves Cheezies, but shocked at the high price!",I absolutely adore Cheezies and make it a point to pick up a few large bags every time I go back to Canada. I was so excited when Amazon started selling them. I bought 2 bags thinking I would get a decent size for the price. Sadly the bag is only 210g or 1/2 lb (smaller than a regular bag of chips). The bags I received would have cost about $3 in Canada. Not worth it for the $7 price offered on Amazon. This is the first time I have been disappointed with Amazon and their prices. This is not worth the investment.
2,This jack is jacked.,"The 2.5mm female jack leaves a lot to be desired. The jack on the headset I have goes into the 2.5mm female on this adaptor, but it goes in crooked and it's not a very solid connection. I can't use the adaptor with my iPhone 4S unless I cut a larger hole in the case for the 3.5mm male jack which doesn't have an offset to accomodate the standard case's jack cutout. I guess I could remove the case when I want to use the headset, but taht pretty much defeats the purpose of the protective case.Since the design is flawed for my use and the price is minimal, it's not worth the grief to return it. Guess that's how you make a buck, huh?"
1,Bad,This was a terrible buy. It damaged my iPhone port and took several weeks to ship. I guess it shipped from china but there was no follow up to inform me of this.
2,nope seller made every effort,But it's just not going to work. It wouldn't fit into my old Galaxy S3 phone.. I wasn't going to force it. Seller offered to refund my money if I sent pictures etc but it's not worth the hassle. Seller seems honest but the part is bad
1,"It worked, but the tip broke off","This little gadget arrived in the mail today. I put it in my phone to adapt my headset to my android. It worked decent, the connection is a little fuzzy sometimes. And it cuts in and out. This is probably because the gadget is poorly made. The very tip of the adapter got disconnected and lodged in my phones plugin. I would choose another adapter if i were to buy again"
5,the BEST one by the VANDALS,"THIS RELEASE HAS TO BE THEIR BEST COLLECTION OF TUNES.I DO OWN EVERY RECORD THEY HAVE EVER RELEASED,SO THIS IS A JUSTIFIED STATEMENT. EVEN THEIR NEWEST RELEASE IS NOT AS GOOD AS THIS ONE. AN EASY '5'STARS."
4,Excellent Reader's Adjunct,"The Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary is an essential tool for any reader. Their encyclopedia is very helpful in addition because there are often times when a simple definition is not sufficient explanation.If you are interested in a detailed study of a subject found here, you will have to look eleswhere, but this is an excellent place to start: to learn about, amplify or confirm your basic understanding of a subject."
5,A Godsend,I told my husband the boys were all his that morning. I had to get a breath of air. Thank God He placed this book in my hands when I reached the Christian bookstoore at the mall. It was a Godsend. Someone really understood after all. I wasn't alone and I was not a bad mother. I have read this book over and over and have given copies to other moms who think no one can understand. Thank you to Maurine Adamek.
1,horible,its a bad little device you are beter off going with the amarican torches it holds abought 20 seconds worth of butane tont buy it
1,stupid,The pencil torch is a cool thing to have if it didn't try to kill me on the first use it basically exploded in my hand so don't buy this product
5,Could not be happier!,"This is the most elegant contemporary chandelier I have seen anywhere. All the wires that feed each of the lamps are totally hidden inside the structure. We have it on a dimmer and it adds a warm ambience to the dining room. Everyone so far has complemented us on the choice. Installation was easy. And, in my book, the price was right - you should not not be disappointed!"
1,Can the adapter be used for coolpix 4500?,I own a coolpix 4500 and wonder if the adapter in the kit can be used. thanks.
3,Seiko STX1 guitar tuner,"I purchased 2 of these tuners, one for each guitar, ( they don't work very well on a mandolin ). At first they seemed to work pretty darn good, but then one of them be came out of calibration. You have to tune it to F to get an E, Bb to get an A, D# to get a D, You get the picture. I have to tune 1/2 a tone higher than it reads so that it is concert pitch. Frustrating!!The other one still works fine. I know that there is probably some simple adjustment to get it back to concert pitch, but I don't know how to do it. I threw out the long winded manual. So I find it hard to use.I did use my strobe tuner to tune the guitars and check the uncalibrated tuner & it was right on, except for the naming of the notes.Expensive for a tuner that doesn't work properly, but the other one is a high quality tuning machine and works well."
3,"grindhouse ""planet terror""",Interesting & gory movie; my boyfriend wanted it for Christmas. Arrived on time & in perfect condition.
5,Planet Terror,"Just like Death Proof i think this movie was amazing, this one is more action packed, and moves at a faster pace, but is really fun, you just cant take it seriously, and you will enjoy it.While not as original as death proof this one is hillarious, and Rose McGowan does a terrific job, its extremely funny when she puts the machine gun on her leg.And please stop complaining about separate dvd releases, we know your opinion already. I liked extended versions and its a better release."
5,A Rip Job For All Horror Movie Fans,"I went to see Grindhouse when it came out and I loved it. When I heard that this movie was going to be released into two discs I was very disappointed. The movie was intended to have a grindhouse movie feel to it but by seperating it you lose the movie experience. Those who say that we should support the movie by buying these discs the way they are, are wrong. They are giving in to what the studios want, money. If the studios don't come out with some kind of special disc with the two movies and the faux trailers I'm not interested. So be it. You have to stand by your principles not as a movie goer but a horror movie fan."
5,Rodriguez did it again.,This movie was intended to be cheesey. So I set my bar pretty low before I saw it. If I had high expectations I wouldn't have been disappointed. Everything was as over the top as you would have expected from a B-rated grindhouse film from the late 80's to early/mid 90's. Worth adding to the movie collection at home.
1,"1 star, becuse 0 wasn't a choice","Imminently forgettable. I'm old enough to have been to a bunch of drive ins with this sort of movie. They took a genre which sucked, took the parts that sucked the hardest and then made an embarrassing movie out of them. Complete waste of time and money. Self indulgent, adolescent, moronic...these are the guys who make poop and fart jokes and think they are hysterical."
1,Beware!,"Now I know why these were on such heavy discount at another retailer... I'd say that only about 25% of the discs have worked so far. Either they won't burn, or won't play correctly. The ones that burn seem to either not work in CD players, or they skip horribly. They look great though - LOL!"
1,Deception,"Good selection but terrible sound. Only stereo sound (not Surround) and the quality of sound is very bad (like it's video). If the sound of the full shows of Mtv Unplugged is like this...i wont't buy any.In fact, i wont listend again this DVD. I thought than the Mtv products were perfect. I will drop it to the trash"
3,boring,"I was very disappointed with this book. I expected so much more after reading The Last Time I Saw Paris. I thought that the story was very boring. The fact that the story was based in Tuscany helped a little but overall, I found the book and the characters extremely uninteresting."
1,Ugh.,"Well-versed in books that take place in Tuscany, I was sorely disappointed with the empty, predictable plot holes, the vaguely perfect characters, the untouched and unrealistic view of what Italy is really like, and the insecurity that twinged just about every character in the book. Why can't there ever be a romance novel with a heroine that doesn't trip over herself or realizes that maybe, just maybe, she's just not too bad looking? No matter how much time Adler may have claimed to spend in Italy, her notion of a place where nothing changing, life is better when it's simpler, and every Tuscan town is full of interesting and intriguing Italian stereotypes is sorely mislabeled. Time to take a few more trips to Italy...or hire a better researcher."
3,Double 15 domino set,"This is a basic double 15 domino set. The box is sturdy and a reasonable size to hold dominoes, trains and even the separate trach/whistle I purchased. It's disappointing aethetically, though. The dominoes are different thicknesses, and the placements of the dots are not particularly uniform. Clearly poor quality control on the part of the manufacturer, which is unfortunate for a game that probably will last forever."
5,Great!!!,"I love this dominoes and I the price was unbeatable. The ""collectors tin"" is very sturdy and the dominoes in excellent condition. We can spend hours playing with them in so many different ways."
5,Dominoes Double 15,"These dominoes are colorful, easy to see, and easy to handle. They are great for larger groups and/or extended play for 3 or 4 players. Their storage tin is in itself a colorful tin for those who collect and display metal storage tins."
3,Ok,This is an okay set of dominoes. Many imperfections. Some of the dominoes are misshaped. Paint on the sides not just the dots.
3,The saga goes on,I did not enjoy this as much as the earlier books. There are too many characters to keep track of now.
5,Read it!,"The story of a young man, lost between two worlds, that of Lord Holder, and that of Dragonrider. Lord Jaxom,unexpected Impresser of Ruth, the White Dragon, will never be a true dragonrider, or will he?A fabulous story of growing up, courage, friendship, and daring.Whenever I think dragon, I think McCaffrey, and then, The White Dragon!"
3,"Excellent book, but one objectionable spot","The title says it all. I believe that the Dragonriders of Pern series is an excellent series, with this being one of the best. However, there is one spot, right after the mating flight of the green, where Jaxom and his girlfriend engage in explicit sexual activity. It isn't just made obvious, it describes it. For that reason, I have only given it three stars. But if the writer had left that part out I would have given it five stars."
3,A very slow book,"Nothing much really happens here until the second half of the book.The author's characterizations are pretty good, but as hard science sci fithis whole series rates pretty low: people call it ""fantasy"" as likeEdgar Rice Borroughs or Conan the Barbarian? If so it lacks the action that such series demand. I actually don't much like the style of the writing either, as it is very verbose ( says in five pages what could be said in one). This kind of writing makes me want to skip ahead and find something happening...If you are going to base a series on dragons, action seems to be demanded not thoughtful, characterizations and colorful characters."
4,White Dragon on Kindle,"The White Dragon is one of my favorites of the Pern series. I'm very glad to see them all available on Kindle.However there is a drawback with the Kindle versions. The maps of Pern at the front of the book seem to be printed very fuzzily. I enlarged the maps on my DX and the images were still too fuzzy to read the map text clearly.This is not a major problem at all, in fact I just printed out the maps available on the net for reference while I read.Still, I think publishers should look carefully at any illustrations in Kindle editions to make sure they are clearly readable. I've seen the problem in other books as well."
3,What happened? Worst of the 3 dragon books.,"The worst of the 3 books. Jaxom is spoiled and extremely trampy when it comes to being with women. McCaffrey seems to hint that Jaxom will be with Menolly at the end, and in the middle of the story changes this so he will end up with another person. It seems as if McCaffrey changed her mind in the middle of her writing. The story goes through dry spells where there is no action and the plot does not seem to be moving anywhere. Jaxom is a spoiled child (even when he claims he's a man but makes actions as a child) whom no one seems to put in his place and ends up messing with people's lives with no consequences. It is hard to empathize with a character who takes people's feelings and the consequences of their actions for granted."
2,"Nice Idea, Poor Product","The animals and ideas in this book are very cute. However the instructions and pictures were poor. I purchased another balloon kit and found that kits beginning instructions and diagrams a lot easier to follow. So I practiced using the other kits instructions and then was able to make a lot of the animals in this book just from having experience on how to make the twist from the first kit. I couldn't get the pump to work. My husband could, but it ended up breaking after one day. The balloons must of sat in heat or something because they got sticky at the twist so if a twist moved a little bit it pulled a whole in the balloon causing all your hard work to deflate. Very fustrating. I even bought 2 bags of refill balloons made by the same company and they did the same thing"
1,Very poor quality,"Nobody buy the balloon animals kit because it doesn't work. It wouldn't make into shapes, and it was super hard to blow up. When you twist them, they pop, or they go back to normal. And the directions were not very good.Jonah, age 7And we were so excited.-Mom"
4,Balloon kit fun but not the best quality,Balloon animal kit was a lot of fun for my 15 yr old step son. The only problem was a few of the balloons had holes in them and he ran out of balloons pretty fast. Otherwise it was good. I got him a larger air pump too so he didn't use the one that came with the kit.
1,Not What I expected,I Purchase the How to Balloon Animal Kit and received something completely different than what was pictured. I got Fun & Easy to Make Twistie Balloons. The Quality is very cheap like something you can buy at the dollar store. Really disappointed I wasted my money and didn't receive what I was expecting.
1,Wall Charger didn't work,"I received this product along with some others. The wall charger didn't work. I didn't bother to return it as it was $.99. None the less, it is always disappointing to get something that doesn't work."
2,"Useful, but not the best book on nursing","I have used this book for three months, since the birth of my daughter, and it does have useful information. But the tone is quite strident, and there are better books available. My favorite is The Nursing Mother's Companion, by Kathleen Huggins."
4,Jump & Jive,"""Big Backyard Beat Show"" bursts with energy & some of the hottest country/rockabilly licks you're likely to hear! My favorite track is ""Wild One"" with its totally infectious joyful rocking beat, ""I never went to school, I was way too cool, I got the jump, I got the jive, I got the message I'm alive."" ""Out of Habit"" is another bouncing romp, ""I went out drinkin' & don't you know, I didn't come home til a quarter to four, I got the boogie fever & the woogie release, she said, 'How come you always the last one to leave?'"" ""Seven Nights to Rock"" is another great flat-out rocker with an infectious beat. Even when they slow it down a bit like on ""My Name Is Mudd,"" Don Herron's steel guitar weeps like a juke box 25 miles out of Nashville on a Saturday night. BR5-49's set pops and bounces joyfully in some of the most infectious country you're likely to hear! Enjoy!"
4,Mavericks indeed,"Probably one of their more commercial efforts, ""What a Crying Shame"" still stands tall when compared to other, more mainstream acts. ""Neon Blue"" is my favorite song on this album. ""Oh What a Thrill"" is another good one. What is so disappointing with this album is that modern country stations seem to be scared by the uniqueness of it and those who created it. Give this album a chance. It isn't considered ""normal"" by today's plastic country standards, but you will love it, especially if you prefer your country with a distinctive sound."
1,for William Smith fans only,"1 star for William Smith. Not as good a part as say Darker Than Amber but he is in a lot of it. Alas, most of the pic is taken up with scenes of planes landing, people riding motorcycles down roads, towards the camera, nature scenes and such dull stuff so by the time Smith comes on the scene you are asleep and there isn't much action so this attempt at redoing the most dangerous game never comes off because you only get a minute or so of that. There is a scene where a guy gets eaten by piranha. Too bad. Where is Run Angel Run or The Losers on DVD?"
3,Colorful,"Well, it looks nice. It is cheap so I don't think it is that accurate. We are replacing a smaller one since I'm getting older and can't see the smaller one on the other side of the deck. But this one appears to be off by 4 degrees. But for the price it works."
4,"Great looks, flaky accuracy","This thermometer looks great on your patio or alongside the swimming pool. Just one small grumble - although it comes from Taylor ""precision"" Products, it is not very accurate and has no means of calibration. When it arrived, the real temperature was 80 degrees, but it showed 65 degrees! However you can fiddle an adjustment on the bimetallic strip at the back using a pair of pliers. Anyway - what do you expect at this price!"
4,13 inch color dial thermometer,"Installed thermometer on Patio, and large numbers make it easy to read from inside the house. I left the old one up to see if they agreed on the temperature. The new one always reads about two degrees higher than the old one, so not sure which one is accurate."
1,Hooked by the title & author's reputation,"I've tried three times to read this book and have not yet got beyond page 10. Maybe it's because I haven't read ""Dialogues for the Dead"" and I should read that first. I simply find the format (letters within conversations within narrative)too unwieldy and I'm not drawn in."
5,The best psychological mystery writer's best mystery!,"Reginald Hill does an awesome job of weaving together many multicolored threads in this book. Each plotline is beautifully spun out, each character believably inhabited, as always, but ""Death's Jest-Book"" raises to a new level the question of who-done-what that Hill has used to tantalize readers in previous books. Be sure to read ""Dialogues of the Dead"" before you open this, or you'll miss half its power. ""Jest-Book"" and ""Dialogues"" are probably the best detective stories I've read in 30 years."
3,"Disappointing sequel of ""Dialogues of the dead""","I am an avid Reginald Hill fan and have read all Daziel and Pascoe mysteries. What started my ""obsession"" was Dialogues of te Dead, which I thought was great. I then went back and read all the other D&P books, and even ordered the UK edition of Death's Jest Book, since it has been out since last September.What a disappointment and waste of efforts and money. The plots are disconnected and some of the characters, which we have followed for several books now seem like completely different personalities.I would definitely buy the next Hill D&P mystery, but this time wil wait for it to come in paper back, preferably in a used bookstore."
1,DO NOT BUY THE MICRO VAULT PRODUCT!,THIS IS A HORRIBLE DEVICE. IT IS NOT USB 2.0 COMPLIANT. IT IS VERY VERY SLOW. I TRIED EVERYTHING! THEN I CAME ACROSS A FORUM AT http://www.everythingusb.com/NUFF SAID!!!
5,Great purchase,My niece needed this book as part of her summer reading list. It arrived promptly and in great condition. It was true to its description. Thanks so very much. I highly recommend this seller.
4,An Adventure for everyone,My Everest Story is a fun and adventurous book. I really liked the book. My Everest Story is about this boy named Mark. He has a love for mountain climbing. His dream is to climb Mt. Everest. He can see Everest from the mountain he is climbing. I would definitely recommend this book.
4,MY EVEREST STORY,"I read Within Reach with my class and thought it was a pretty good book. I thought it was very descriptive, and amazing. It is about Mark Pfetzer, a 13-year-old boy who discovers that he really loves climbing. After climbing lots and training with hundreds of exercise routines EVERY NIGHT, he prepares to climb the biggest mountain on earth---Mount Everest. Can he make it?"
5,Another Great CD!,"At first I didn't think I liked the CD as much as their first CD. Then after I listened to it over and over I really started to love it! I'm someone who doesn't normally like country music, but I hear a mixture of country, pop, and rock. Now their song Ya No with Kalimba is a mixture Reggaeton, rock, and country. All of the songs on this CD are great! The ballads on this CD are so great! Hanna and Ashley both have amazing voices! They are amazingly talented. I would recommend this CD, because the more you listen to the songs, the more you will love them."
3,Blu ray aquarium,"Although the product states that it WILL work with all Blu ray players, it does not. I have two blu ray players. The product works in my Sony player but does NOT work in my Sam Sung blu ray player.....I will contact Sam Sung to ask if they have a new firmware update to solve the problem."
2,not good representaion of HD quality,I have bought this disc but I was really disppionted this hd dvd is horrible absulatly not good represantion of the hd dvd picture quality the dark areas in the picture is just horrible
1,doesn't work on all hd dvd players,i purchased this item and played it on my xbox 360 hd dvd player and i got an error message. apparently the format is different than standard hd dvd's. the regular dvd works fine and the features are great but its unfortunate that i can only view this in 480p.
4,First time buyer,I was searching the web for an Aquarium in Blu-ray and I found Amazon. Everything went just fine. I may do this againHerman
1,Never received the item,Vendor claimed they would no longer provide this item through Amazon because of numerous difficulties. It was a shame because they were the cheapest source of these projection lamps I was able to find.
1,GARDNER ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO IAN FLEMING,I havent read any of gardner's books. but from what i hear leming rules all bond novels. I say stick with fleming forget gardner. Benson's allright.
1,it is not good at all,I'm sorry but I just want tell that adoption and stuff like that are boring for people who don't know what is going about there. We don't realize hardness in it. I was bored when I read this book.
5,Masterful mix of mystery & history,"It's hard to understand it now, but the mystery about this ship, found vacant on the Atlantic in 1872, had a profound grip on the public in the years around the turn of the century. Obscure to us today in the 21th century, the mystery of the Mary Celeste had the appeal then that UFOs and Kennedy assassination conspiracies have for some today.Author Hicks is to be congratulated for conducting mountainous research on this facsinating story, yet making it all accessible and readable. While perhaps not as engaging as a detective novel, it nonetheless was hard for me to put down.In the end, Hicks' elegantly simple expanation for the mystery ties up all the loose ends that the crackpot consipracy theories couldn't explain. Well-written, enjoable, and highly recommended."
5,Awesome advice for teen girls!,"What a great book for teen girls to read and reread as they struggle with peer pressure and their own insecurities. Buy this for your young teen daughter even though it is a bit irreverant and has a couple of minor what I consider ""rude"" words. It is a ""cool"" book and hopefully will be heeded, as it is a very positive, empowering book. Where was it when we moms needed it!"
4,Great Page Up/Down Function but Weak Laser,"This product has a huge range for going up/down between slides on PowerPoint. It also works with a pdf file or MS Word document. I could even change slides from another room! It has a very comfortable design and comes in a great carrying case. I was disappointed, though, that the laser wears out after about a minute of use. Hopefully, I can exchange it for one that works better, or I'll have to use my old laser pointer in one hand and this product in the other for my presentations."
1,a piece of junk,"The first time I used it during a presentation the laser died, and the slides either advanced five at a time or not at all. A disaster."
1,Fails in linux,"Most things like this (mice, keyboards, pointers) work fine with linux, particularly distributions like Ubuntu, Mint, and Fedora. New drivers are not needed as this sort of thing is standardized and new hardware works immediately. I am currently using a wireless logitech keyboard and mouse which worked immediately when I ""plugged"" it in.This pointer FAILS utterly.TOO bad as its a nice unit. BTW, it works on my old Micro$oft XP box."
3,Not bad for the money,Definitely does the job. Leather-esque strap. Weird snap system instead of a traditional sliding strap adjustment. The fuzzy material is really cheap. Falls out in chunks when you first get it but settles down later. I wish I had spent a little more for a nicer strap.
4,A chip off the Ol' Block,"Deana Martin has a very good voice. Not great, but very good. What she lacks in her vocals though, she more than makes up for in style and arrangements. This album is easy on the ears. Ditto for her ""Volare"" album - proof that there's still good music around. Don't expect her to try to copy her father. Many of Dean's songs are done with the same arrangements, but Deana has her own style. She's her own singer. For some reason she seems to be a well kept secret."
5,DINO WOULD BE PROUD,"It was so special listening to this CD...I have been a Dean Martin fan for many years...To hear his daughter sing his classics as well as songs from Frank and Sammy, as well as her mother...This was a special CD...And most of all the duet with Deana and Jerry Lewis was precious...what an ultimate tribute, by his daughter and partner...Deana has a wonderful voice and I was pleasantly surprised...This was definitely a class act CD...Kudos for Deana for recording these timeless treasures...Thank you...Amy Leddy, State College, PA"
1,Low quality products and poor packaging,I ordered two boxes for my kid's scientific projects. Both came as damaged tin boxes with poor packaging. Worst of it is that the dominoes in two boxes coming with different size. One is at least 2mm thicker than the other.
2,Be carefull before you install it!,I thought this light was a good quality product before I install it. Bulb socket had shortage and caused me whole bunch of electrical problems...
3,Lectures on Faith,"Lectures on Faith by the prophet Joseph Smith provides concise information about basic gospel topics. I found the Question and Answer section after each lecture in many cases to be redundant and not extremely helpful with some exceptions. For those new in the church this can be a good handbook to review basic principles, but for longer term members it provides little new information to that provided by the missionaries."
5,Wonderful- recap of the funny call-in quiz show,"I am a big fan of Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know? show, and I just loved the CD. It was so funny that I listened to it 3 times the first day I got it! I am buying it for gifts!A wonderful gift for Feldman fans!"
4,Excellent account of Hallie's life from about 1897-1950s,"I met Hallie Stillwell in 1991 in Ft. Davis. I have camped in Big Bend and area, and her book told of her life around there - her early life, the dangers of the area, her marriage to Roy, her children, her ranchlife plus living back and forth from ranch to Marathon. It is an excellent account of Western life at that time - hot, dusty, busy, trying to survive, herding cattle, raising children, enjoying the land. She wrote well. It's easy to read though it jumps around some. She has a second book which I have not been able to locate. She died about the fall of '97, just short of her 100th birthday. Her ranch is still near Big Bend (about 45 miles south of Marathon and 20+ miles above the Rio Grande) and has a trailer park, general store, and an excellent museum."
4,I'll Gather My Geese,"This is an excellent read, most students can successfully endure this book and afterward speak fondly of it (and that is no small testimony). The reading level is about sixth grade and the subject matter inoffensive to even the most sensitive, while still captivating the reader. Filled with real life stories about the life of a woman who took on her little part of the west. While not an adventure thriller she manages adventure just fine, in this readers opinion anyway. Her father said that she was going on a ""wild goose chase"" moving away from home. Her reply was ""Then I'll gather my geese""."
4,Authentic Texana,"Hallie Stillwell was an authentic West Texas rancher and this narrative is the straight stuff. Life in the Big Bend country with no electricity, running water or paved roads was quite different from our ""conditioned"" world today. If you are in to gun control, wildlife preservation and immigration reform, you need to look elsewhere. But if you're interested in reading about a plucky gal with loads of grit, this one's for you."
4,"Rich is excellent, but the ""real"" Jesus Record is just okay.","Rich Mullins is an outstanding musician and composer, and even when he's just sitting in front of a jambox there is no mistaking his talent. I really miss his work in Christian music.The Ragamuffin's completed Jesus Record, however, is not as good. While I commend the effort, the songs are really lacking without Rich there to enliven them. When I choose the CDs I want to hear, I find myself almost always skipping the polished recording in favor of Rich's purer, rougher, cut."
5,Powerful and Captivating,"I think we should play ""My Deliverer"" all day every day! I am guilty of cranking the album up for all the neighbors to hear. I think that Rich did a great job, and that he would be happy to see how this album has moved so many people"
5,"It really pumps me up, and is in my car all the time","I have always liked HW's music, but this time I really listened to the words and musical arrangements. He mixes it up well and it does not bog down. I LOVE THIS ALBUM! I recommend it to all who love gospel music."
1,this book did not impress me,"As a bisexual, I found this book to be rather upsetting. Mr. Douglas starts off explaining why ""the roots of bisexuality, its causes, are often evidence of genuine psychological disturbance."" Among other things, he believes most of us are nymphomaniacs and unable to commit to lasting relationships. He even goes so far as to describe the character traits of the bisexual male and female, as if we are all virtually the same person. It seems to me he based his book on the prevailing bisexual stereotypes."
2,Not long lasting,"I bought this hose bib a few years ago. For the first year or two it worked fine. After that, we couldn't leave the main hose bib open because it would build up to much pressure and leak. Now, the connecting piece on the hose bib broke. I wish they sold replacement parts for it."
3,Good product,"I needed to extend my outside faucet since it is located behind a tall bush. This works wonderfully, however, you will need something more than dirt to brace it once you place the hose on it otherwise it will tip over."
2,Totally uneven,"In my opinion, NOFX, Screeching Weasel, and Wizo are way too good for this compilation. Only like the last 5 songs are interesting on this cd. If you are fans of the bands I've listed, just buy their albums and skip the rest of this."
3,Escape Into The Real World,"First I want to comment on what was said by Patricia L. Schrein. Although it seem to me that Ms. Schrein was doing a little ""male bashing"" herself. Especially making ironic remrks about the Author whom she knows nothing about. It was so easily perceived to me that the book ""Escape Into The Real World"" hit her in her ""own back yard"". Which is why she finds it so painful to read.As I read this powerful book it seem to be so real. I could not wait to get to the next page. It really kept me on the edge of my seat. It is an extraordinary thriller and I highly recommend people to read this book about a family secret that eventually comes to light."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I have had an extremely frustrating morning trying to work out how to use this software, which is the worst I have ever tried. I bought it, trying to avoid all the annoying popups that come with Quicken, but would rather suffer those than struggle with this immensely difficult to use program"
1,Dangerous,"This book had beautiful illustrations, and the storyline seemed very genuine. Unfortunatly though, it shows one side of an issue that is very fragile by creating villains out of the Arabs community and for that, I feel it promotes hatred toward that community. I was hoping this book was somehow aimed at creating peace between the Isreali and Arab community."
5,Stamp of approval,"We bought this date stamp to replace one for the previous 10-yr period. We had hoped the new inner date section would be compatible with the old custom outer section, which had my wife's name and title. When that didn't work I was able to remove the custom rubber stamp from the outer housing and replace the new one, which only had the word ""PAID"". Otherwise, the item was just what was needed."
1,Not for developers.,This reads like an ADO.NET user manual where all possibilities are mentioned but lack reasoning and coherence in the subject. Its not an easy read and was not written for develoipers who needs to quickly get to the topic instead its more for trainers.
3,"Some parts were funny, but it was mediocre at best","We're always looking for a good zombie movie to add to our collection, but this didn't really hit the mark, nor did ""Shaun of the Dead"", as opposed to ""Dead Snow"" (w/eng subtitles)which we both liked quite a bit."
4,Great zombie flick for fans new and old!,"Irreverent, bloody, laugh-out-loud fun. ""Juan de los muertos"" overcomes its derivative premise and shoddy visual effects thanks to its incisive political satire and clever camera work. The third act is murky, but at that point, you'll be so engrossed in the film that won't care."
5,Great movie and a must see!,I have been into zombie movies and books for 30 years. In the last few years they have gotten stale and boring. This movie is as fresh as it can get! Fantastic movie from the land of Castro. Its got it all if you like good makeup and watching the normal guy fighting zombies without it being too unrealistic then it's a must watch for the true zombie movie fan. It's about a loser and his buddies taking a bad situation and trying to turn a profit. Really funny and serious when it need to be. Heck it even ends with Sid Vicious's My Way. If you liked Shaun of the Dead and Tokyo Zombie then you will love this movie because its way better then both combined! Your collection will not be complete without this amazing movie.
3,Willie Horton is an everyday man in a superstar's body!,"The book is somewhat dated, having been written in 1970, yet there is no denying that Willie Horton is a wonderful humanitarian. As someone who knows him today, I can say that the great things this book says about him in 1970 still apply today. He is an unpretentious, genuine man who would give his shirt off his back for someone in need. He also happened to be an amazing ball player! This book details the early years of his career and describes a man who never was caught up in his own press articles. A story about a poor kid made good in his own hometown."
2,"it's not bad, but you dont really need it.","It includes a case and a car-charger, which are not necessary for everyone. In addition, an earbud comes with the phone itself."
3,A little bit disappointing,I bought this book because it is about a very interesting subject of the 60s motor racing scene. It shows an attractive layout and contains lots of rare pictures not to be found elsewhere which makes the purchase worthwhile. But the information is a little bit disappointing. There is few more than a chronological description of the races which the Scuderia attended and the cars and the drivers. These facts you can find elsewhere. The book contains hardly background information which cannot be found in other sources. In addition there are more but a few errors about the facts. After all: My English isn't perfect but the author's isn't either.As a whole considering the price a little bit disappointing and no more than 3 stars.
4,Enjoyable and real,"I really enjoyed this book. Ann Leary has an engaging and enjoyable writing style and a great sense of humor. Her story, about her premature son Jack, was touching and heartfelt without straying into maudlin. I read it in one sitting, in a few hours, and can honestly say it was worth staying up until 1:00 am to finish it, even though I'm now grouchy at work."
4,Refreshing and entertaining,"Ienjoyed Ms.Leary's casual and friendlystyke of writing; it gives you the impression she isin the room with you telling you this story over a cup of coffee or tea which would be more appropriate, You feel her anxiety and love for her new and very fragile child. I also think Ms Leary did an excellent job prasing the glories of the Premie Post Natal Department of the hosital where she had her very premature baby. I enjoyed the book very much."
4,Shop around,"It's actually cheaper at Home Depot and I wish I had checked there first. Also, you need to set it into the ground with concrete for it to be useful. That is not mentioned in the Amazon.com description, but is certainly what is instructed on the item when you receive it. Works well once you set it in concrete."
2,Mine arrived without handles,I've ordered these sippy cups in the past & the lid had attached handles. These ones did not. The photo is misleading.
5,I love this CD,"Six years later and I still love every song on this CD! One of my favorites is ""St. Cloud"". The whole collection of music on this CD goes from being a strong woman, the soft touch of a woman, heart break, and love.Trisha Yearwood, thank you for a great collection of songs on one CD!! This has been well worth [the price]."
3,A Star That Fell From The Sky - A Little Too Long Ago,"Above Washington, - like all of Robert Cameron's Above books - is a superb collection of historical to present day comparison photographs. The picture quality and composition is bar-none, especially for aerial photography. Any city planning or Washington D.C. buff will enjoy this book immensely. Please be advised, though: this book has not been updated in quite a while eventhough it has been reprinted many times. The most recent photographs are late 1970-`80s era pictures. Above Washington could definitely use an update. Nevertheless, it's a great D.C. history lesson and has many unique photographs of places such as the U.S. Naval Observatory where the Vice President lives, as well as an aerial view of Marine Ones parked like ducks in a row. Need good pictures for a project - Cameron's Above Washington is the way to go. Want a current picture or coffee table book - you better reevaluate."
5,If you are looking for all the hits.......,A great package of Del goodies with the alternate 61 cut in stereo of Runaway. Has the usual gems and a few others and most definately a best buy if you are looking for a comprehensive 'hits' collection.Time tho for the powers that be to put out more of his non-hit catalogue - many gems exist and its a project crying out to be tackled.Buy this!
2,Disappointing,"Because the author's sons were burned in a playhouse fire, I was intrigued by her personal story and wanted to see how that would play out in this fictional account of a burn victim. I was disappointed by this book that I found confusing and difficult to understand. Since the story is told from an 8 year old burn victim's perspective, the storytelling is limited. I was longing for more detail that an 8 year old would not have the maturity or knowledge to explain. I almost wish Lee Merrill Byrd told the story from a mother's perspective. There certainly are disturbing images throughout the book that are difficult to stomach, most notably the way Riley's mother treats him. However, I found myself struggling to get through this book. With short chapters and big margins, it should have been a page turner, yet I finished the book with more questions than answers."
4,A Difficult Topic,"This was a sad book but I enjoyed reading it. The topic was a difficult one and I learned a lot about burn victims. By seeing it through the eyes of the child, it made it easier for me to absorb the horror of what was taking place. I felt the mother's pain and total exhaustion in dealing with this situation. This book left me feeling hopeful for Riley and his family."
2,My golden won't touch these treats,"These treats may be great for some dogs, but my golden did not like the taste. I had hoped to use them as small training treats (such as the BilJac liver treats), but she would have nothing to do with either the peanut butter or the salmon flavor. The salmon variety has a very strong ""fishy"" smell, too."
5,Zuke's Mini Salmon Treats 16 oz.,Great price. Fresh product. Fast shipping. A nutritious treat for your dog. The mini size is nice to use to reward your dog whether for training well or just to show your love for them. Mini size helps prevent obesity in dogs.
5,Stubborn terrier,My Morkie is smart but has resisted obeying when I call him. The Zukes Mini Naturals have made a big difference. I give him one or two treats every time he comes in the door and now he is responsive to my call.
4,Arf ! These are the best !!,My dogs get a treat before bedtime and they love these treats best by far . They are in their crates in a nano second !!They give them 5 stars ! I give them a 4 on amazon as they seem to be priced little high .They are more than a local pet store .I do buy them from amazon as well as they can be hard to find at times .Amazon always comes through for my guys !!
3,Dries out very quickly,"I was really looking for a moist treat for training my lab puppy. However, these tend to harden up quickly. My lab loves the taste but it takes him about 30 seconds to eat one, even when I break it in half."
2,Sosa,"They were ok, nothing great. My dog didn't seem to enjoy them that much. Probably won't try them again. Sorry"
5,Great for my toy fox terrier,"These treats are great training treats for my 12 lb toy fox terrier. I even normally cut them in half. she loves them! I mainly get the chicken and PB flavors. the salmon one seems to have too strong a scent to it that I don't care for. They arent' messy or crumbly, and since my dog loves soft chewy treats, they are pefect for her."
3,Dog likes them!,"My dog likes these treats, but definitely prefers the peanut butter ones better. One strange thing I've noticed with these treats is that they tend to harden very quickly -- so you're best off buying the small bag (seen here), not the bigger bag. It's strange -- the salmon flavor does harden faster than the peanut butter flavor. But, all in all, they're a good treat to feed your dog because they're so small. They're perfect for training, and Zuke's is always full of good things, not some crappy ingredients like some other dog treats out there."
5,My dog loves these!,"I tried the Zukes Savory Salmon out over the fall. My dog loves them and responds so well to them for training. Although they eventually get dried out over months, she still reposnds to them. I must say that having them for only training helps. Little doggie biscuits for being a good dog, and then Zukes for the real training works. Highly recommend."
5,Love!,"My dog loves these, great for putting in interactive toys, also great training treats. Love the few ingredients, food allergic dog."
3,its ok,My dog likes these treats but not as much as just plain boiled chicken. Saw this at the store picked up a bag there. This also gave him terrible diarrhea first few times he ate this. Good size for training treats. I probably wont be buying any more.
4,"Great for training, but as everyday treats? Meh","My 100 lb yellow lab loved these. But they are so small, he really doesn't fully enjoy the treats. He just swallows them down like a pill. I'm guessing these would be perfect for small breeds, but for a large breed dog (and his owner), not quite worth the split second thrill he gets out of it. Not to mention the price. A little much for a 1 lb. bag the size of a pea(maybe a little larger). 4 stars though for an obvious irresistible treat."
3,Dog treats,Used these in my dog's puzzle toy -- he would eat them but never seemed very excited when he got them out of the toy.
1,Doesn't like,My dog refuses to eat it and it smells pretty bad. I can't recommend it as treat when my dog refuses to touch it.
1,"Not up to expectations, more like gelatin than chicken","Our dogs love chicken so, after reading all of the positive reviews and noting that the first ingredient was chicken, I was really hopeful that these would be their new favorite treat. They sometimes will play with them for a minute but will not eat them and are not the least bit excited about them. They even lost interest in the sound of the treat jar that normally gets them very excited. These treats feel and look more like a wad of gelatin than chicken and have been relegated to the trash bin. They would be a little on the expensive side if they actually were mostly chicken but they are way overpriced for sort of chicken gel wads.While almost everything ""tastes like chicken"" these treats don't, as evidenced by the fact that our chicken-loving dogs do not like them one bit."
1,Toy Maltese hate salmon flavor,"I was training my maltese puppies, using chicken liver treats, every time i would throw the ball, they would bring he ball back for a chicken liver treat. I ran out of the chicken liver, so i opened the salmon. They got he ball and i gave hm salmon. They ate it the first time after smelling it or a while, the second time they got the ball they did not touch thebtreat. I have tried 3 othr times, and they hate this stuff.I will not buy or recommend this product for Maltese"
5,Good Value,"Good treats. Dogs don't care so much about the size of a treat, and these little numbers are highly-prized by my dogs. I like 'em because they are small and I don't worry about weight gain. You see, I spoil my dogs."
2,My dog did not eat them!,The texture is too hard and my dog turned his nose up at them. I ended up giving them to my friend for her dog. I wouldn't purchase them again.The size is good for training purposes.
4,good for the dog park,I go to the dog park every day with our four dogs. I want to get them to listen to me so I work with them using these as training treats. the dogs don't care that they are tiny- every treat is like a steak dinner to them when it is given with praise. These treats are also good because other dogs will often hang around looking for a handout and if their owners say it is okay I am fine giving them away one at a time- they are bigger than tic tacs but smaller than a life saver and there seem to be a zillion in every bag.
3,"Smells Aweful, but Jimmy Loves It",I can't stand the smell of this treat. They are very bite-sized (tiny little beads). I wouldn't mind them so much if they smelled a little better. As it stands I can't be near the opened bag without getting naseous. My daughter feeds him treats now.
2,"Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-Ounce","Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-Ounce, this product was turned down by my pet. Gave it to another who had three dogs and only one of the dogs would eat it and the other two would not even take it out of the hand of owner. I tried this product because it was a american product, would not recommend."
3,"Don't hold Dog's attention, Gas","I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up."
5,the best song on the radio today,This is the #1 song I have ever heard. It has that classic Spanish beat and rythm to it that makes me want to hear it again and again. This is the type of song that our kids will listen to and like.
1,Not good,"Poor design. Men: Don't buy this book. Women: If you are into New Age ""feelings"" and alternative lifestyles, you might like this book."
4,So far so good,"We were moving overseas and needed an expensive multiregion DVD player. This certainly fit the bill. You can tell that it is somewhat cheaply made--for example, the tray that you put the disk on seems like it could easily break. We've only had it for a few months (though it has gotten quite a bit of use) but so far it is preforming well and we have not had any problems."
5,Can't go wrong with these Highlighters!,Convenient two pack. They work really well and don't smudge - what else can I say. Very happy with the purchase.
4,Holocaust,was very informative and Had unseen footage. A piece of history that should never be forgotten!
5,In the worst of times,This is more of a documentary that shows more of what Hitler did during WW11. Most of it is very graphic but it does show what had happened during the worst time in history.
3,Good Idea,"I think it is a nice approach to making simple changes to improve your life. It was informative, it just wasn't the book for me. Every week or so you focus on making one change until it becomes a habit and then you move on to the next step. I will say that my cupboards and closets have all been cleaned out, and I was certainly motivated to clean out one space in my life every week. Therefore nothing gets out of control."
4,Perfect,"This notebook is amazing. Perfect size, weigh, useful bottoms...The only thing that doesn't make it 5 stars is the battery that stand for only 2 hours.I recommend this notebook."
3,"For a Better Picture, Read This:","Coming Out of the Ice, by Victor Herman -- out of print but still available -- an autobiography of an American citizen who went to the USSR in the 1930's, got sucked into the gulag, and was spit out 30 years later --an incredible story that would be unbelievable if you saw it as a movie. No other book has affected me the way this one did."
5,How do you identify a monster?,"I read this book greedily, it's very fast paced and is very conversational in tone. I immediately felt a connection with the main character, and was both shaken and horrified by the subject matter in which the three main characters are involved in (trying not to give spoilers). But to see how my own mind got sucked into what happened and how I found myself drawn in to what ultimately was NOT like me, well, it will pull you into it as well. Gives you something to think about yourself, and how you can identify a person, perhaps consider them a friend, but just how much do you know them and what do you condone?"
4,Freekin' Come Back Already,"While their best, this is still a very nice track from a group that has been out of action for way too long. This maxi-single is packed with various versions of this hit. My only complaint about the single is that they didn't include the remix that features Raekwon & Ghostface Killah. Sure it has the horrible line ""She's got stacks like the International House Of Pancakes,"" (that might not be an exact quote, but the idea remains the same.) but it's still a bangin' remix and should have been included here.Tracklist:1. Freek 'N' You (Part 1)2. Freek 'N' You (Funky Freeky Mix)3. Freek 'N' You (Radio Edit)4. P.I.B. 4Play (Interlude)5. Freek 'N' You (Freekoustical Mix)6. Freek 'N' You (Freekstrumental Mix)7. Freek 'N' You (Freek-A-Pella Mix)Peace,D"
3,Weak Intro to von Mises,"Planned Chaos was added on to Mises' masterpiece Socialism, an Economic and Sociological Analysis. Planned Chaos works well as an epilogue to Socialism. On its own it has serious limitations. To those who lack familiarity with Austrian Economics, Mises' claims might seem weakly argued. Mises explains his theoretical arguments in great detail in Socialism, an Economic and Sociological Analysis. Here the reader is left to infer much of what Mises is arguing. Only those who have read either Human Action, Socialism, or at least Bureaucracy will really get what is going on in this book. As such, this book has limited value. If you want to get the general idea about Mises read Liberalism, the Classical Tradition. That book is the best intro to Mises. This book is simply lacks the material needed to stand on its own. Read it as the epilogue to Socialism, an Economic and Sociological Analysis."
2,Ok but not great,The wallet was of the highest quiality but the product was to big to fit into any of my pants or suit pocket. It needs to be smaller in size and keep the function.
5,Discover a Secret,"Herbal teas, shmerbal teas, right? Wrong! This one's the exception! I bring a box of this tea when I go to visit, and every single person I've given it to has LOVED it! It is surprisingly tasty! Honest! No funky tastes here! I've had other brands, but this one's the best. I'd bet this becomes your new FAVORITE tea!"
4,Classy horror flick,"I was hoping to get a video of this movie but it's not available. It was wonderful watching Bacall as a highly successful middle aged Broadway singer/dancer. Michael Biehn as her stalker is great and he's been in lots of action movies since this first movie. I've seen ""The Fan"" several times since it came out and I've never been disappointed. James Garner as her former husband does a fine job too. All in all, I think it's well done and superior to most first run scary movies I've seen in the last decade."
3,Nothing New Here,"How many books have I read about the college student whose girlfriend gets pregnant? I've lost count. This adds nothing to the genre and is pretentious besides. The girl is a complete cipher and the main character, Charles, is maudlin at best. Why are we being told this mundane story? Just because he happens to attend his 30th college reunion. And is Charles actually sitting in the dark thinking all this through? I can't recommend this book."
1,I've Been Conned,"The misleading title of this DVD borders on outright fraud. The majority of this whopping 38-minute film is a re-enactment of Hearst's childhood told in a style appropriate for kindergartners. After 20 minutes, we adults awaken from our slumber to see actors playing Hearst and Julia Morgan pantomiming discussion about the castle while the insipid voice-over drones on. The final few minutes of this turkey re-enact a weekend at San Simeon in the most irritating way possible. Cameras sweep briskly through a few rooms of the monumental castle without pause or significant comment, as if this brief part of the movie were just a trivial afterthought.A disaster, an embarrassment, and a major disappointment. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
5,Wonderful !!,Took the tour of Hearst Castle a few years ago and just loved it. This DVD is a way to revisit the Castle and indulge in its history !!
1,Disappointing,I was hoping to see achive type photography of the building of the Castle. There was very little. It was just a cheap re-enactment using bit players. I would never recommend this to anyone.
3,"Nice size and features, short battery life","Ordered this directly from HP and have had it for about 3 weeks. I purchased it because it had all the features I was looking for in a tablet pc includind built in web cam, touchscreen, dvd reader/writer and small size. The touch screen costs extra. The biggest draw back is the short battery life of the 6 cell battery which is only 2 hours. Some more shortcomings include very reflective screen making it hard to see at times and the touchscreen which in the tablet mode doesn't match closely with where the pen touches the screen this is very annoying. The other annoying thing is when switching into tablet mode, open windows don't automatically adjust to short width and long length. It would also have been nice to have a scroll wheel or buttons while in tablet mode. Other then the issues mentioned it has been working good. I just wish the battery lasted longer."
5,This is an amazing booklet!,"This is an amazing booklet! It's perfect for any couple that has trouble thinking of things to do when they're apart--it's not designed to be an advice-giving book. Personally, I always get stuck in a rut and can never think of fun things to do long distance, and these ideas really helped me. So this booklet is perfect for anyone who is in the same situation--I haven't found any other source for long distance activity suggestions like this booklet. And just a neat sidenote: I have heard that the military loves this book and buys it by the thousands because it really helps soldiers to stay close to their sweethearts. I'm just so glad there is something out there to help these people who are fighting for our country!"
5,Very Disturbing,"If you like slasher films, you won't like this. It's much better than most horror films. Evocative. It's in the same category as Irreversible, I Stand Alone, Man Bites Dog."
5,An all-purpose book.,"I purchased this book after the sudden death of a friend. I was at a complete loss as to how to deal with it, and had never experienced this type of loss before. I was shaken.I can't believe my good fortune to have this book. It taught me so much about the role Grief plays in our lives, as well as it's not just limited to the lose of a person or relationship. Grief can come in all forms from all things. I found it very comforting to discover this and it actually helped me to embrace grief as a natural precursor to healing.This is definitely a great book to have around, and did give me some tremendous insights. I highly recommend this book for anyone having experience a loss or a feeling of loss that you can't seem to attach to anything. I really feel like this book was a sanity saver in a sense, as it helped me identify something I would have never recognized as 'grief-worthy.'"
3,Informational Note,"Just a note, as you must either look at the box, or call KitchenAid - these blenders are manufactured in China. Not saying that is good or bad - but this information is missing from all product descriptions."
5,A very forthright view of the Native American and their treatment,"Without being ""preachy"" or trying to be ""politically correct"" this account of the native American and their plight against the early settlers in North America is an eye opener. Very well written without the ""pretext"" of trying to explain it away, the author descibes a people desparately trying to save their culture against the ""inevitable"" being betrayed every step of the way. ""Food for thought"" for the 21st Century and the meaning of nationhood."
1,A very poor Re-recording of the original hits...,Middle of the Road was a famous pop group in the early 70's with a distinctive sound and rythm. This album does not cary the original song but a poor re-recording done in 1998. To avoid.
5,One of our family favorites!,"My kids (ages 6, 8, and 10) LOVE this game which we've had for about a year. We play a slightly different variety when the older kids are playing... you can hold one card in your hand instead of playing every card immediately. This puts a little bit of strategy into the game.I brought this game along to a sleepover with my daughter's Girl Scout troop (a bunch of 10-year olds) and they couldn't get enough of this game!"
5,Sssimply fun!,Our 4 year old rec'd this game for Xmas and it quickly became her favorite. It's easy to learn and we all enjoy playing it. We've given it to others as a gift.
5,Fun & Educational - its true!,"I purchased this game on the clearance shelf at WalMart and was thrilled b/c it was sold out everywhere last Christmas when I wanted it. My 3 and 5 year old love it! Big fun for the whole family to spread out on the floor and play together. Every kid that comes to our house wants to play this. Very simple, but colorful and a bit thought provoking for younger kids. (I'd say age 7 would be the max for it - bored) I'll take another reviewer's advice and buy another set of cards for bigger snakes!"
3,pretty fun,"Got as a gift for my 4 1/2 year old for Christmas based on reviews on Amazon. We've played it a few times, and he likes it...but it's not a very competitive game and he really likes to WIN at something. The graphics are really great and we have had fun playing so far...but it is not going to be the first game he asks for and I'm not sure it would be the first one I'd think of either."
5,like a soap opera......only good,"when It comes to shojo manga I tend to stick with ken akamatsu or rumiko takahashi. But after reading some online reviews I knew I had a winner in the form of fruits basket.The thing that imedidiatly struck me were the characters,and how likeable and real they were.The story is also very cool,I see a lot of potential in the story,I really cant think of more to say.......ummm buy this,trust me you will love itp.s I hope tohru ends up with kyo, just my opinion"
4,Great for those looking for lighter manga...,"The story of 'Fruits Basket' is wonderful! The comedy is comical and the deeper moments are deep. ^.^ And that's how it should be. My favourite moment is in the first book (I believe?) when Tohru explains how everyone has an onigiri on their back with a different flavor of umiboshi in the middle. (Or something like that.) Anyway, she uses it as a brilliant metaphor for different people possessing their own special abilities and personalities. Even though it does get a little bit deeper as the story progresses, I'd save this for a day when I'm in a grumpy mood and need an uplift. Tohru is so kind and sweet it's almost sickening, and sometimes that's what I need."
5,Fruits Basket,"This is the first manga I ever read and I loved it! I am so glad I bought it, the artwork is good, kinda pointy and you can relate to most of the characters (except for the whole curse thing) You will love the characters I guarantee it. You'll be sad for them and cheer them on EVERYTHING and I'll tell you now you WILL laugh out loud. Natsuki Takaya I love you! And Kyo is better!"
2,"Cute, but lacking in substance","This is a definitely CUTE book. It tells of a very modest girl and her need to belong. However, the lack of a strong support and structure have made this become an okay book. The characters are very distinct, and the storyline is original. It still needs a strong plot to make this into a great manga. Basically, this is a sweet, but mindless book. It is great for a mindless read, but if you are looking for an actual book, this is not what you are looking for!"
2,I.don't.like.Tohru.,"I mainly don't like this manga because of Tohru; I HATE HER. I'm not collecting this manga, becuase,A.) I'm a girl who likes shonen manga.B.) Humor is lacking, and fight scenes are boring.C.) Seemingly all the guys like Tohru.D.) It's all about Tohru.E.) I hate Tohru!!Now, I'm pretty sure I've gotten this through some of the thicker skulls, and I don't care is you don't think this is helpful. I only read it and continue to read this volume because of Shigure. Shigure is awesome."
3,Beware of copy protection on this CD!,"I can't enjoy the CD as a direct result of the fact that Sony will not enable me to download this legally purchased CD to my iPod. This may not be the direct result of M/M but it certainly inconveniences their buying public.If you desire to import songs for listening while in transit...do so only if you own or plan to own one of Sony's propietary devices. Personally, I am staying away from ALL Sony products (HDTVs, CDs, etc.) from this point on..."
1,DON'T BUY COPY PROTECTED CDS,ENCRYPTED MUSIC TAKES AWAY OUR RIGHTS AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND DON'T BUY THIS ARTISTS MUSIC!
1,Don't Be Fooled By The 1st Single Released,"When I heard the first release from this album, ""Heaven"" I loved it and thought to myself ""They've done it again!"" I was so excited about their 3rd album. Well, if you are expecting the same kinds of songs that you heard from the first 2, you might be disappointed. You'll find hints of big band, disco, blues and more. It sounds NOTHING like the previous albums. Don't get me wrong, I'll give it a 10 for creativity and it's nice that they've branched out and tried something different. It's just not what I was expecting. If you like the song ""Heaven"", don't be fooled because it's the only song that has that Mary Mary style and sound. I'm having a hard time finding a 2nd song that I enjoy listening to and wish I had passed on this one."
4,Much Better,This album is much better than their second. I had only heard the song name Heaven. Since I have bought the album I have now heard Yesterday. I love that song. Can't get past that song.
5,A AWESOME JOB,MARY MARY ONCE AGAIN DID AN EXCELLENT JOB ON THIS CD. I LOVE ALL THE SONGS. THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST SONG IS WEIRD BUT THEN IT GOES RIGHT INTO THE SONG. I LOVE IT. MY FAVORITE AND THE BEST SONG ON THE CD IS YESTERDAY. MY GOD THIS IS A BLESSING. I LOVE THE WORDS BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST A BLESSING TO MY SOUL. THIS IS THE BEST SONG. I LOVE THIS WHOLE ENTIRE CD. IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS I PROMISE YOU NEED TO GET IT. OH YEAH IF YOU GAVE THIS ALBUM IS BAD REVIEW THEN YOU HAVE A REAL PROBLEM BECUASE AFTER READING YOUR REVIEWS AND LISTING TO THIS CD WE MUST BE LISTING TO 2 DIFFENET CD BCEAUSE THE ONE THAT I HEARD IS OFF THE CHAINPEACE AND GOD BLESS YOU
3,More than you need to know,"The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde is an encyclopedic (539 pages) compendium of late Victorian sexual activity. Such behavior seems to have been far more extensive than one might have thought, but the book has verisimilitude and suggests that virtually every man in London, from the Royal family through the Cabinet right down to petty clerks, was gay.According to the author, both Wilde and Bosie Douglas were highly promiscuous and even introduced André Gide to the gay life. The phrases ""Uranian"" and ""men who love men"" appear on almost every page - even though love seems to have had very little to do with it -- and the author points out gay allusions in practically everything Wilde wrote."
5,awesome,The first time I cut my dogs nails I knew I may need this and thank goodness I did get it. I caused my poor dog to bleed very badly and she was in so much pain that I surly cut way too deep. I put a bunch in the cap and stuck her nail in and it stopped bleeding. She continued to lick it but it stayed on and she did not bleed after. I am so happy this is a needed product for anyone who has a dog!
5,Worked Great,"I accidentally clipped one of my dog's nails too short, so I used this stuff and it worked great to stop the bleeding."
1,previously used / opened,"when i opened this product to get ready to use it, i discovered it had been previously opened and there was dried material (looks like dried blood mixed with the powder) around the top rim of the bottle. also, bottle was 1/2 empty (""may"" be due to settling, but HIGHLY suspicious because the bottle was NOT sealed and the dried material on the edges!). shipped from amazon and they won't let me return product (returns expiration 2 weeks ago)."
3,?,"I never had to use it, so I don't know if it's ok or not. I take my dogs to the pet shop so the professionals can do all the grooming stuff properly."
3,"Good price for product, but haven't had the chance to use it yet.","I bought this when I bought a nail trimmer for our dogs, hoping to avoid vet or dog groomer bills, but the nail trimming didn't go so well so I never got to use this (not that it's good that you have to stop the bleeding of your pets toe after clipping it off), but for the price of the item, I'd say it would be worth it for those of you that have no problems with your dogs allowing you to trim their nails. ;)"
1,Big Letdown,This was the biggest letdown ever!!! I was expecting a good sequel to perfect dark but i got a halfrate game boy game. tsk tsk tsk. The only good part is getting codes out of the deal.
4,Pretty Good,"I saw alot of the reviews for this game and I didnt know whether to get it or not, so I decided to try it. I am pretty impressed by this game. It is not bad at all. PD reminds me of Goldeneye, with the objectives and the watch and everything. The game is challenging, and requires you to be patient and watchful. The weapons are okay, but I dont like how they are hard to fire. I do like how you can get the leftover guns from guards. The rumble feature lets you know you got hit and the training segments kind of sharpen you shooting skills. The graphics are also very good for a game boy. The bottom line is, this game is a goldeneye for the GB minus the music..."
4,Fun and full of action,This game is full of action and a true shooter through and through. The graphics are pretty good. There are actually voices to hear which makes it neat. This game does get gory. the only bad thing is that the training is really hard!
1,Horrible Game,"I got this game b/c the N64 version was so much fun...whoops. On every level, Perfect Dark GBC absolutely stinks. The controls are sketchy, the sound effects pathetic, and...what else? Everything.The single worst characteristic about this game is the fact that you can't see the enemies in the room with you until it is too late. When you do discover there is an armed guard in the room with you, it is usually b/c he is running towards you with his gun blazing. Bang bang, you're dead.I could go on and on, but let me just sum it up: THIS GAME SUCKS!"
3,Lack of power.,"I have seen Tesla live a few times and I think they did a better job live on these songs then how they came out on CD. Worth a listen for songs like ""The Way It Is"", ""Be A Man"" and ""Love Song""."
2,Disappointed,"I had heard most of these songs in a live version and was hoping for the same great music. I was really disappointed to find that the old recordings were really bad. I would definitely recommend 'Five Man Accoustical Jam' over this. It has a much better collection of tunes, and a much better sound."
5,Yes! Bring on the DVD!,"It's about time for this to be available on DVD, Layne Staley was one of the great vocalists of our time and a DVD of this show is long overdue. The fact that Mark Lanegan was part of this show makes it a no brainer. Please issue this on DVD! There will be a long lasting market for this performance I assure you."
3,Partially ghost written?,"Something strange happens part way through this volume. The first part as well as the first two volumes read like a history. The last part of this volume reads like the usual political propaganda disguised as sensational journalism that is common these days. The latter chapters are padded out with an excessive amount of tedious details with no historic importance to the ordinary reader, such as the descriptions of all of the cases of genocide in a civil war."
4,Stacking Tables,We enjoy our tables very much. The legs on the medium table did not fit the table correctly so I had to re-work. They are all fixed and things are just fine. We received a credit of $22.00 for having to fix the table.
5,excellent value and very good performance,A well made and nicely engineered product that is a bargain for under fifty dollars . The ART phono preamp sounds much better than the phono input on my Pioneer Receiver.I wish the ART folks would market a more expensive and higher quality model that you could upgrade to if desired .
5,Just what the doctor ordered,"This little gadget restores the mag-phono function that every amplifier used to have and none of the new ones seem to have. It's compact and nicely made; but the important thing is the sound. No apparent distortion, clean, with none of the hiss and microphonics that the old 12AX7-based tube preamps had. No hum, either. I'm using it with a Shure V15 cartridge."
3,Missing something,"I enjoy Brooklyn Tabernacle music. Creative melodies and harmonies, with great worship lyrics, especially the songs that describe what a great God we worship. Most (but not all) of the songs on this CD seem to be missing this. The words are along the lines of ""I worship you"", ""I adore you"", ""I'll say yes"", ""I never lost my praise"", ""We bless the name of Jesus"", etc. ... but with little mention of what makes God worthy of our worship. Who is He? What has He done? ...for you personally? More attention needs to be placed on God Himself rather than our worship of Him.I'm not saying that these kinds of songs are bad - we need them too. But if this is all there is, then it ends up being only an emotional experience."
4,Inspirational,"The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir is back with it's latest offering, ""I'll Say Yes"". TBT is still doing what it does best. That is giving us messages from the heart that inspire us to press on and not to grow weary of doing good. Put God first and then everything else will fall into line. The TBT choir does not ""perform"" but rather, it ministers to those who need to be encouraged during these days of trials and tribulations. On this album you will find sweet ballads and soul stirring anthems to lift your spirit. I never lost my praise is the track that comes to mind. It speaks of giving God the praise even in the dark times because He always comes through for you. It encourages you to not let the world steal your joy and rob you of the praises that you should offer up daily. I believe you will be truly blessed by this album and I encourage you to purchase additional copies for those who would benefit from a spiritual lift. Enjoy!"
2,Great Praise but nothing distinctive,"I enjoy the music of the BTC very much and over the tears there are songs by them that I listen to over & over such as "" So You Would Know', ""My Life Is In Your Hands"", and ""I Made It"". In my opinion this CD does not capture the unique style of the BTC. It is very ordinary."
4,"Good Quality Headset, But Design Getting Old","This headset is a great choice for those Bluetooth users seeking function over form. Good talk time, long standby life, and short time to recharge make this a power-savvy device. Audio quality is very good for the user, a little less better for the person on the other end of the call. Stays on the ear well and is comfortable to use all day.However, it's time for Palm to roll out a replacement, because this headset now looks dated. No one would select this from a gallery of the headsets out there today, and it looks clunky on the ear."
5,Deep Moisture Cream,"This stuff really works. Not greasy. I really like it. Hard to find in stores, so I get it at AMAZON."
5,Leonard Horowitz,"A must read for everyone!! This book contains so much vital information, guidance and hope for our times and the world culture we see developing around us."
3,Good history/foreign policy book,"Read this book and enjoy the emotional roller coaster that comes from it. It makes you annoyed, happy, angry, incredulous, proud, etc of the intelligence and stupidity of everyone involved. Way more detailed than the movie and more accurate.It does run a bit long though. Although the first 2/3 was a quick read, the second I was forcing myself to get through. But should be required reading so that everyone can hear about the pros & cons of the US foreign policy."
4,Unbelievable Characters,"If you put the political implications aside, this is an unbelievable story portrayed by colorful characters. Yes, there are troubling aspects to the funding of the Taliban, but the world was different in 1985 and what better way to pay back the Russians for Vietnam than to fund the Taliban. Whoever was against the Russians was our friend (no matter how foul the regime), who would guess what the Taliban would become. To say the characters were colorful is a gross understatement. If you do not read this book, just read the end of the book Epilogue:Unintended Consequences. I don't believe men like Charlie Wilson can exist in this day and age and it's a shame. It is a good book and will give you a different view on the post 9/11 world. The book has some grapic descriptions on what happened to captured Russian soliders. This will make a great movie. I would love to visit the Kyber Pass."
1,Hard to read,"Content was OK, I'm sure acurate, but about 210 pages into this 500+ page book I had to give in - I just couldn't make myself want to read it. I am only 31, so I do not know of Charlie Wilson, or the political temperature in the 80s, but this book was recommended to me so I tried, but couldn't make myself do it."
4,Every Catholic should read this book,"This is a book which everyone who cares about the Catholic Church should read. It is the story of a journey - a journey made by Lavinia Byrne from her middle class Catholic family background, a journey that took her into the confines of a convent and ultimately to a clash with the Vatican. Byrne's crime? To talk openly about the ordination of women to the priesthood in the Catholic Church. The Vatican ordered the American publishers of her book on women priests to pulp it. The Congregation for Religious put enormous pressure on Byrne's own religious order to stop her talking about the issue. Ultimately she was forced out of religious life. This is a fascinating account of the tensions within the Catholic Church. Do not miss it!!"
4,watch this film,This was a well done movie.It has it's emotional parts and its intense parts. the acting is good and does not look low budget.i reccomened this movie.
5,Bird caught on fire but beware of the primitive sound,"There have been many comments about the recording quality of this disc and they're all true!! But the brilliant music that emanated from Bird's horn compensates for everything. In a Saxophone Journal interview, saxophonist Bert Wilson called Bird the first avant garde musician and after listening to this disc--I totally agree!! Even before Ornette arrived on the scene, Bird was already playing some far out s**t and this recording proves it!!! He is still light years ahead of anyone playing now except perhaps Ornette or Roscoe Mitchell."
1,Not helpful for women in E-tailing,"As a woman who is starting my own "" Silicon valley startup"" I am always on the lookout for material that is both helpful from a business perspective as well as empowering to women. This book provided neither of these things. It had the possibility of giving women who are running their own businesses an inspiring message to succeed but fell far short of this goal. Ms. Kurtzig's message to women is one that needs some serious debugging. E-benefits and Ask computing customers be wary!"
1,Where did he get his facts?,"I am a translator/writer for Japanese publishers and have been researching and studying the Japanese Forces in WW2 here in Japan for over 20 years. When I saw the book in a bookstore I naturally bought it but after reading only a few pages I immediately regretted the purchase. Here is why: In the introduction there is a photo with a caption that reads: The grave of a Japanese officer... The Japanese characters identify the soldier buried there as a Superior Private. On page 69 the author writes that the Japanese Army had no tank divisions where in fact they had 4. the 2nd tank division fought in the Philippines in 1945 and was wiped out there. There were also at least 7 tank brigades in the homeland waiting for the US invasion, a fact which is also not mentioned. There are several more mistakes which would make a person familiar with the topic cringe so the question is why authors and publishers do not make a more in-depth research."
2,Powerpack book dated,The copyright of ths book is 2004. Some web site references are not current.Mandrakesoft is now named Mandriva Linux. Book good as resource. Linux that came with book would not load on an HP Pavilion ze4808us laptop. Don't suggest buying. Suprised and angry that Amazon still had it for sale.I bought a competitors Linux.
3,Why the R rating?,"This was a good movie, but I think that Rob Schneider could have done a much better job with it. The performances by the supporting cast are funnier I think. Take Deuce's he-pimp. That guy was funny. Before Rob Schneider makes another movie starring himself, he needs to make sure that he is the funniest character."
1,You people are so easily amused.........,"This ""film"" (it pains me to call this a film) is full of the easiest, no-talent-required jokes imaginable. My dead great grandmother could write better material. Rob Schneider was really desperate to make this PIECE. When are you people going to learn what good film is? Can't you see production companies of movies like this are taking your money to lower your IQ, which can't be too high to begin with if you like this kind of thing? Wake up. Have a little self respect and watch movies worth watching. This movie is not a one-star rating, it's a zero-star rating, but that wasn't available. So, from zero to four, zero."
4,As funny as it is offensive.,"All I can say is this movie lacks taste. If your looking for a movie that the family can watch...skip it. If your looking for a first date movie...skip it. If your looking for a real funny movie that does not take its self seriously, and manages to offend just about everyone, see this movie."
5,Rob Schneider is great!,"I saw this movie, and I thought Rob Schneider was great. (All his dates were funny, too)"
4,Oddball fun,"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999) Rob Schneider, William Forsythe, Eddie GriffinRated R.I thought this movie was going to be a totally nasty comedy but I was quite pleasantly surprised.Although off color and raunchy, it does feature some clever, good natured humor along with the low brow shenanigans and it has few fun insights into the strange insanity of male/female relationships.At many times tacky and crude, don't be fooled because underneath you might just find a warmheart beating away between the chuckles. It's actually part chick flick, too.This film is definitely not politically correct, but there are some unexpected values hinted at here, even though everything is played for laughs.It might be best for the easily offended to steer clear of this one, which is geared to the open minded.No blatant nudity to speak of unless I somehow missed it.Oddly enough, according to reviews I've read, some women found this movie not only funny but somewhat endearing."
4,"Moronic humor, yet very enjoyable!","I didn't know what to think about this movie. I watched Rob Schneider on ""Saturday Night Live"" but before he became popular, Rob was a Filipino-American who loves comedy. One thing that made me happy was to see him insert part of his Filipino heritage in the movie with the bibinka cake. Otherwise, how about the movie. I really enjoyed it! It was so funny and enjoyable that I never got tired of it. It was really entertaining.The audio and video is pretty good in the movie. It's mostly a dialogue movie and I really didn't notice any major sound usages on all speakers but otherwise the quality of the video and audio. Good but not the best.The DVD came with a few special features such as the featurette and comparisons. Would of loved to hear a commentary from Rob about the movie. It also came with a trailer.All in all, this movie is really entertaining. Moronic...I love moronic humor and very witty! Check it out!"
3,women pay me to give them pleasure,"Deuce(Schneider) is hired to watch Oded Fehr's house and fish, but he messes it up when he breaks Fehr's expensive fish tank and then ends up becoming a gigolo to try to get the money so he can repair it. funny dates and good humor, though William Forsythe always talking about his twig and thin penis thins the movie out. but nevertheless Schneider comes out on top and for you Oded Fehr ladies you get to see his bare ... which was disturbing."
1,Another unfunny American bloke,this movie is what is wrong with you American Blokes shame on the states.Rob Schneidder and anyone else from SNL just wishes they were half as funny as those on Monty Pyton or SCTV.
2,Lasted a month and a half...,"I bought this product in mid-March, and it's already kaput. (It's May 1, 2007). It was great when it worked, but now the screen doesn't work. It just stopped working.The good:Great portable player to take in car and also in home.Solid construction.The bad:Short screen life. Quit working with less than 90 days use."
4,Fun look at a great national park,"This book makes available dozens of photos from the park's seldom seen museum collections, as well as extremely rare photos from the South Dakota State Archives. Badlands National Park was authorized in 1929, established in 1939, and remains today the largest national park in the Midwest."
4,Check this out.,"I recently purchased this book for my fourteen year old daughter, she told me it was a great book. In fact I am looking at purchasing more in the series. She said it was not too religious for her- she could relate with the main character."
4,Nicon Monarch,"Great Bino for the price. Clear, easy to focus, good in low light, very comfortable eye cups that are easy to adjust works well with glasses. My only negative is the eye cover it is a loose fit and even though it fastens securly ti the neck strap it dosen't stay on very well.I would highly recoment this item"
5,This is one of my favorite Cliff Richard CD's.,I have been listening to Cliff Richard since the early 60's and have collected many of his recordings. I must say that this CD is one of my favorites. I hope to be collecting Cliff Richard CD's in the next millenium.
3,Slick Style,"Real As I Wanna Be is easy-listening in a nutshell. Unfortunately Sir Cliff hit some trembly notes and they show that he isn't 30 anymore. Still, his voice is as warm as ever, so one shouldn't complain too much. However, there are some gems on this album, like the title song. Buy it if you're interested of his new, streamlined style."
3,MISLEADING,MISLEADING PICTURE on these items. You will get TWO black NOT a black and color cartridge. Sellers should update the picture.
5,This is a book that delivers everything its title promises,An excellent glossary that clearly delineates the terms used in theosophic study and creates future clarity for their use.
4,PrimeFilm 3610AFL,The scanner came on time and in good condition - well packed! I have used the scanner only sparingly so far but it seams to work very well for what I have done. I would seam to be a good unit.
4,Sleek,"These are a little tall for me. But when I have worn them, they receive lots of compliments. I ordered true to size and they are fine."
1,save your money for the live show..,"I don't think this cd stands on its own out of context of the live slideshow. The father's voice is a little hard to take after 1-2 tracks. It's more entertaining visually and when the songs are in context of the slideshow. I have to say, I think the concept is actually the best part of this. I saw them live recently and it's ok, but the father is particularly annoying, rambling on and on."
2,Letters from Camp,"I thought the characters were flat and predictable. Furthermore, I found myself beginning to cheer for the unscrupulous characters as they seemed more interesting. If you like grammatically well written and artistically well illustrated, overly-simplistic, cotton-candy story lines, this is the book for you. All-in-all, the book wasn't too bad, but, I don't think I'll be picking it up to re-read anytime soon."
5,Well worth the investment!,"Very user friendly as far as programming, quality performance. This is my second order of this unit, and a newer version. I thought the first one was great, and this one is even better!"
2,Wished it worked with my Allstar receiver!,"I have a Allstar model: ""ARD11A"" garage door opener and the transmitter (remote control) has 10 dip switches. This product only supports 8 or 9 dip switch units. As a result I can't program the remote for my receiver. (Probably works fine with other Allstar openers that don't have 10 dip switches.)"
2,Far too technical,This is probably a wonderful book if you are seriously into pharmacology and a closet scientist on the side. If you are looking for a book that will tell you how to grow or harvest opium keep looking. If on the other hand you like to look at drawings of the DNA structures of the individual drug isotopes found in opium(and believe me there are alot!) then buy it.
4,:),"I gave this to my little sister for Christmas. She loves it. There were marshmallows covering the floor for days. (And, yes, we WERE cleaning up after her the entire time.)"
1,Time to play the OVERWEIGHT game.,"Have any of you guys actually seen triple h lately. The man is obese. I have to admit before he left on his four-month vacation, back in June 2005, he was in pretty good shape. Then he came back to the WWE on their special homecoming episode in October 2005 and man he was huge. It looked like he was the one pregnant, not Stephanie McMahon. It seems like triple h has been having too many burgers and not lifting enough weights.It seems to me, that the only thing bigger then triple h's ever-increasing waistline is his gigantic nose. I think it's wrong for a guy like triple h to write a bodybuilding book since he is so terribly overweight, its like Stevie Wonder writing a book about bird watching. He needs to spend more time in the gym and less time at the WWE buffet table.Overall, I did not like this book because I have no interest in bodybuilding what so ever and I'm straight. By the way the cover to this book is so GAY!"
5,There is no other book like this one on the market today!,"I read over thirty books a year and in the course of reading I sometimes forget what I have read. I also unable to read faster and to me that was a problem. Paul Scheele's PhotoReading book can help take care of this problem.In just over 160 pages you'll find techniques for improving your reading and comprehension books. Scheele conveys an easy to follow set of guidelines and makes reading more enjoyable at the same time.With the understanding that knowledge is power, PhotoReading allows you to retain more information and recall what you've read giving you a better chance at success.The steps from this book helped me immediately and with continual use I am sure to be able to photoread in no time flat. You can find other books on speed-reading, but you'll never find another book on PhotoReading."
3,Do you really expect to just read the book and do it ?,First of all I have no vested interest in this book.I happen to think this skill should be possible. Milton erickson performed experiments in hypnotic time distortion that enabled people to experience an hour of time in a few seconds.There are plenty of people with photographic memories etc.Much of the material by the author goes to pains to explain that we are dealing with a subconscious phenomena.So if you are so stupid that you think you can read this book and Kapow !!! - you can do it - well no wonder you are dissapointed.I am not a neuroscientist or hypnotherapist. But people used to think the earth was flat didnt they. How boring and narrow minded of them.
1,Do not waste your money on this rubbish,"I wish I could give this book no star at all, because it doesn't deserve any. The clue is in Mr. Steele's own assertion that most books are more than 90 % fluff: his book certainly is. But not so the books that I read or teach.If Mr. Steele were to apply his technique to reading James Joyce or Proust or Toni Morrison or Jacques Derrida for my class, he would make a very big F at the end of the course. So would anyone who buys the silly ideas in this book. No, you do not understand a serious book through the kind of trickery that Mr. Steele suggests.Beware. There are many snake-oil peddlers out there. There ought to be a law protecting consumers from folks who peddle wares that do not deliver. This should apply to books as to other products. All those who found this book unsatisfactory like I did, should be able to ask for their money back."
2,A Follow-Up Review to My Earlier One,"Okay, now I speak from a little more experience. I have been practicing ""PhotoReading"" regularly since writing the last review, and I can say with confidence that PHOTOREADING IS UTTER NONSENSE. The gimmick, that actual PhotoReading portion of the ""whole mind system"" is a brief, but utter waste of time.Recognize that ALL these ""accelerated learning"" gurus HAVE to come up with some sort of gimmick to distinguish their brand of uselessness from all the others. PhotoReading is Scheele's gimmick. I tried his techniques in one of my graduate classes, and you simply don't get the detail from the text that he claims you do by PhotoReading, and ""dipping and skimming.""No matter what these hucksters promise, there is simply no substitute for hard work."
2,You probably won't learn to PhotoRead from this book,"However, for me the jury is still out if PhotoReading works or not. I bought the home study tapes and I have been encouraged somewhat, although not nearly to the same extent as the other reviewers here. A salesperson at Learning Strategies told me ""that practically no one"" learns to PhotoRead from the book alone. Buy the book only to get an idea of what PhotoReading is about, and then be prepared to spend $250 for the home study course if you want to explore it further. In my opinion even if half of what they claim is true, it's worth the investment."
4,"Interesting concept, not sure if it works.",Its an interesting concept and I enjoyed reading the book and trying out the excersises. I believe that there is some validity to the principals but I think you may need more then this little book provides to truly be able to use the system. Paul Scheele sells a whole bunch of more expensive sets of learning material from his website (of course) I haven't bought any yet but I'm very tempted to based on this book.
2,Don't photoread the reviews,"Skim the book, scan the book, photoread the book, osmotically digest the book - you're a photoreader!! Even if you're not a photo-reader you're going to get through this thin and loose volume in not much time. Of course, the book is only part of the technique. Some tapes to improve the memory and change beliefs are going to be needed too.So where are these photo-readers outside the pages of Amazon? Where are the validated studies with the '5 star' reviewers zooming through a book and being tested on it the next day?Pls Mr Scheele - do a controlled test and prove me wrong."
3,Dreadful Sorry,"This was a purchased Library Book The condition was not the best, it was still readable. I enjoyed the book and wanted a copy for my personal library."
1,battery release problem,"My batteries won't release from the tools which is frustrating at best and perhaps even dangerous. As a person contorts their body to push on each of the release points at the same time as trying to hold onto the tool, I wonder how such a design flaw ever made it into production.I am a concrete contractor with large hands and can't imagine how in the world a person with small hands would ever EVER get the battery off. Thinking there was something wrong with my technique, I gave the tool to fellow workers and ask them to take the battery off. One by one, each thinking they were more macho, they took their turn to only finally give up and hand the tool back with battery still on.Not sure if Milwaukee has address and/or fixed this problem as they would not admit the defect design to me. They just said to take it in tool a Milwaukee representative - not a very pleasing aspect when you live very far from the closest one. What a frustrating problem.Steve"
5,Fantastic,"Wow, what an amazing album. Full of passion and romance, by far my fave Joe Henry album. Definitely worth the money."
5,Easy to relate!!!,"Come on Ladies!!! Haven't we all been there at one time or another??? Confessions of an ex-Girlfriend takes the world of ""Coupledom-to-Newly Single"" to a refreshing and hilarious new level!Emma Carter is a 30 something Bridal Best editor who becomes single after her two year relationship comes to a halt. Emma loses it, and is driving her two best friends, Alyssa and Jade, crazy! Stuck with ""10 pounds of extra relationship flab"", Emma realizes that she has to face the truth about being single...and maybe there is more to her than being in a relationship!Along with Emma's ""breakdown"", her mother is getting remarried....AGAIN, her father falls off the wagon.....AGAIN, her hairdresser found God, and her friends are having their own captivating adventures as well!This NYC page-turner will have you laughing out loud! It will bring you up when you're down, and bring you back to reality when you are in that euphoric state of ""Coupledom""!"
5,Really cool,"Excellent adaptation of ""The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus, great animation and it is a uniquestory and really great for Christmas's to come.."
5,Great molds!,"We used this mold to create chocolate lollipops for our 3-year-old's birthday. They were a huge hit. This mold will be used again and again over the years as my girls' gets older -- the chocolate lollipops are incredibly easy to make, but look really fancy."
2,This video comes from a professional studio???,"This film has very beautiful women in it. To bad you don't see them clearly. The picture quality is very poor. It is blurry, grainy, dark and some stop motion effect which ruins it. It looks like they took it from an old warn out VHS. This is the first video I have watched from this company. I have Frazier's Favorites, which I have not watched yet. If the picture quality is as bad as this one, I will not buy another. If the picture was clear I would give this a high rating. As it is, I do not recommend."
4,a trainning method fits for all,"I'd found it easy to apply yet very systematic and well described.i'd follow the method from beginning to end while immidiate starting to use it outside running my own, his method based, program and fill the results.One of the best."
5,Great book,"I had to chose a book for a masters course I was taking. I needed a book on a leader. I chose this book because I like Bush but I didn't know why. Now I do.The book is well-written, informative, historically important and showed me a side of our president that I'd suspected was there but didn't ""know"" was there.I'm proud to be an American under the current presidency and I think a book like this, although written to present our president in the best light possible, manages to also show him as a human being with humanity and compassion. His ability to make a decisive decision and his ability to rise above the petty insults of nay-sayers shows me a man of character: and character is what the White House needed to see again."
4,A truly entertaining read.,"I love Blair Walker's writing. It's witty and smart and thouroughly entertaining. I started laughing out loud on the first four pages and from there on I was hooked. The cast of characters are well developed and whether bad or good guys, have dimension and depth. The story moves briskly and keeps the reader engaged until the last page. I can't wait for the next Daryl Billups installment."
4,book review,This was actually a gift for someone else. They found the book interesting. It had some twists tht they liked.
2,sloppy writing,"The book was mildly entertaining, but the plot had some illogical elements. and the writing was full of unnecessary cliches, rather like that produced by a college sophomore trying to sound poetic and/or learned."
4,I knew how it feels,"After reading many business publications that dictate how the reader should behave, it is refreshing to read a publication that is not shoving do this and do that mantras down your throat. I found this book an easy read but captivating, following some of the various experiences of medium business owners struggling to survive. Having been exposed to this business environment with similar experiences, I finished the book recognising at least 5 areas where I can improve my business. Normally if you find one it is worthwhile, so I was pleased with this outcome."
1,Terrible gift for a child,"This is just another pointless toy made in China. It's nothing more than 48 blocks of wood. The worst part, however, is trying to put the blocks back in the can. The only way to do it is to put each block in by hand one at a time. As you can imagine, this brings my five-year-old to tears."
3,"Its nice, but dont waste your money!","I bought this planner because of all the rave reviews. I thought it would keep me stay organized and give me some great tips. There is nothing in this book that was not introduced in class or in clinical. Not only that, but in our syllabi our instructors have a calendar with all the due dates, clinical dates, and exam dates listed. I absolutely had no need for it. While the concept seems nice, and it would appear to be helpful, all the information is a review of what you have learned, probably just in your first semester maybe second semester of school. It will become just another book that you might read or review if you have time, which most likely you wont. Save your money and your time and stick to the assigned reading."
3,Gasket Order,"The product is good, but I had to buy it from a local merchant because the vendor shipped a different PN. The vendor price was a 25% savings but they did deliver the product, however they paid the return shipping and refunded my money."
2,Disappointed. Lacks variety and enjoyment,"My son, far too young at 4 loves pokemon. This has disappointed all of us because It is far too difficult to even facillitate guesses. The levels are very difficult and lack fun. Its too bad it isnt more animated. Normally, children of all ages can at least guess at these answers. But there is no room for mistakes. Im sorry that I bought two of these."
3,something upstairs by tyson erdmann,"Kenny Huldorf, a boy who has just moved into a new house in Providence, Rhode Island; and the ghost of a slave he meets in his room, Caleb. Caleb was murdered in the room that Kenny discovers him. after several meetings to earn Caleb's trust, their search for who killed Caleb and why he was murdered begins.I've enjoyed it very much and This book has enough twists and turns in it and it keep me guessing whats going to happen"
3,A GHOST FINDERS BOOK,"My book takes place in the Providence of Rhode Island. The main charactors are Caleb( the ghost ) KENNY (the boy) FATHER ( the dad ) MOTHER(the mom ) My book is about a boy and his family that just moved in with a ghost named Caleb. Caleb was a slave that was killed in his sleep. By a person that he knew in his time. kenny was sleeping and he heard a noise that startled him. He soon found that it was a ghost that woke him. when he saw it he freaked out and was scared stiff. He said ""who are you"". then the ghost replied in very faint words ""salve"". Kenny soon got enough mental strenth to ask "" how did you die. And what is your name"" the ghost said ""i was murderd . And my name is Caleb"".Soon Kenny learned to acceped him as a friend. After a little while kenny got a little scared of him when he told his story. Kenny thought ""maybe i should help him""."
2,"OK, but...","The socks are OK as far as socks go. Not super warm, but also not sheer. However, I learned too late that these are way long. They go up over my knees. If that's what you want, then these socks are for you! Mid- to upper-calf is fine for me."
3,Shrunk when washed making them too tight to wear,"Initially, these fit fine, but after I washed them, they shrunk to a point where they were too tight on my calves. The do not come with any guidance on washing/drying, so I guess it's possible they were washed wrong."
4,Really 3.5 stars,The book started as a romance whimpy mystery until the end when mysterious people reveal who they are. Jess was funny and couragous. Okay book!
1,"Not What Expected, No Value","I received a black vinyl-like tether, not metal-looking like the picture. Absolutely useless in practice. Waste!"
3,How do I attach it to the tablet PC?,Seems to be sturdy but I have no clue how to attach it to my PC.
3,This is a product that's a little bit ...,"This is a product that's a little bit hard to review. I think it may have cut down on my snoring, but my wife was unable to provide feedback."
5,GentlePath,"A friend recommended this book to me. I ordinarily prefer a hardcopy of a book however, due to my lifestyle, I love the idea that I can access it on my phone, computer and I-pad (if I had one). I have not finished the book so I can't give a full review, but what I have gone through so far I think is two thumbs up!"
5,A gental Path through the twelve steps,I have used this book for almost 12 years. And I reccomend it to any one battling any addiction. It has balanced my life and continues to help balance others.
3,A good starter,"This book is a good starter. It provides a good introduction on what is a Fibonacci Series, the analysis of such and where Fibanacci numbers occur in nature and our lives. It even has a decient introduction on Lucas Numbers. However, it is just that, a good starter which I would whole heartedly recommend for a high school student that is just about to discover how wonderful math subjects can be. To get a more in depth presentation, one will have to refer to a receintly published paper on the subject or refer to a graduate text."
3,surprised,Surprised because Erdmans' other works were so much better.Cheaply done... no references... Shabby...PeriodC Corcoran
3,The Elusive Indigo,Graham Joyce pursued perfection almost as hard as Jack Chambers pursues Indigo. A worthwhile endeavor that was bogged down by the manuscript of Jack Chambers father. We didn't need to know as much as he wrote. It would have been even better had we known less. Good Character development and plot otherwise though. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
1,Boring,"This book raises a lot of themes and issues and fails to live up to its promise to pull them together into a coherent plot. Mix-mash mush. There is really no excuse why the author couldn't have made better use of intriguing themes except perhaps laziness. I will trust the other reviewers that his other books are better, but I was extremely dissatisfied with the lack of focus and ultimately lack of resolution in this book."
2,What a downer. Save your money.,"This book had such great potential. I tore into it the first night I purchased it and ended up reading until 2am. The first 3/4's of the book really intrigued me. I thought it was going to go down a particular road, but I was sadly mistaken. The story fell to pieces toward the end and I hurled the book at the wall upon finishing it. I felt cheated! Such great potential never realized."
1,Just short of completely worthless,"The information in the book is really old, and when you find the people who the book says is willing to read a script or even take your call, they say they never allowed the publisher to list the information and resent being listed there and that they never heard of the author. The rest of the book is not very good when compared to any of the other advice books that cost half as much."
1,This book is a gigantic waste of money,"Half the book is a detailed listing of production companies, of which 99 percent don't want your material unless you have an agent. The agent listings are no help either, telling you to contact the agents directly, who in turn don't want to see your material. So the end result is that this book is a gigantic waste of time and money."
4,Stars for Ushman,"What an astonishing read. Where so many books are focused on a woman's struggle, immigrant or otherwise, for love and lost love Mullen's RUG MERCHANT is quite refreshing with Ushman Khan being our main character. There are times when I just wanted to grab him up and give him a little shake but ultimately Ushman was a very proper prince. I read this book in a little over a day and am glad that I took the time. Quite lovely."
4,A Near Miss,"Take a heart-broken Iranian immigrant, an unfulfilled, wealthy woman of ""a certain age,"" and a bright but aimless college student. Mullin's willingness to examine their thoughts and feelings in this character-driven novel is admirable, and at points she succeed quite nicely in conveying the alienation and empathy found within complex relationships. That being said, ultimately a writer's job is to tell a good story. Mullins deserves credit for daring to write about the inner lives of her characters. No proverbial car chases, missing babies or serial killers here. But as this leaves us with only the characters themselves to consider, this book might have benefitted from a slightly less tentative rendering. Mullin invents a great cast but doesn't give them quite enough to ""say."" With a bit more courage and color, this could have been a great book; hopefully this talented author will try again."
2,ok cd,this cd is ok to listen to . but i only know 2 songs out of this whole cd. I should of downloaded it on itunes.
4,Cute pot,This is a cute honey pot if you don't have a lot of honey to put in it. I use it more as a decoration than to hold honey.
4,Sweet Honey of a Deal,"I have been looking for this particular little honey pot. My daughters and their step sisters bought these for each other, and then my daughter bought one for me. Now, I am buying one for my eldest granddaughter, who just got her first apartment. I will buy two more, one for each of my other granddaughters, to give when they come of age and get their first households.As far as drips go, the same technique that is used for all honey pots is the rule: one must swirl the drizzler stick continually until one reaches one's cup of tea to keep the honey from dripping all over. After the first few times, you'll get the hang of it.And I agree, I wouldn't want more honey than this out at one time. I live in the country, and so do ants."
5,A perfect curl-up on the couch movie!,"As one reviewer said---as an adult I watched this myself and didn't expect to fall in love with it! I saw it played on TV one Thanksgiving before I even had children and having been an avid Barbie collector in my youth I sat to watch with no expectations. The animation was wonderful and it brought ""to life"" a classic story. It was well done and I bought a copy to enjoy with my own children today. It's definately worth the few dollars Amazon has it listed for!"
2,It isn't the ballet,"Since my daughter, age 7, is taking ballet, I was excited to have two things she likes combined (Barbie & ballet). Unfortunately, the plot and characters of The Nutcracker ballet have been changed dramatically and the dancing limited to the final scene. The video's plot is the nutcracker's battle to find the sugar plum princess and regain his true identity. I particularly found the added ""rock giant"" character distasteful. On the plus side; the animated dancing in the final scene is quite good and the music by Tchaikovsky is used consistently throughout the movie. The movie has a positive message though it is heavy handed. If you are looking for the classic ballet dancing or story you will not find it here."
5,Who Knew!,My daughter is obsessed with ballet and The Barbie Nutcracker is one of her favorite videos. She can now hear the music on classical radio and identify which part of The Nutcracker it is from. Amazing. I had no idea how good the Barbie videos where. The music is beautiful and they are really wonderful to watch - even for adults. Which is nice when you have to watch them over and over and over..........
5,My kids loved it!,"Im normally a bit cynical re barbie products. I think most are cheaply made and sell only due to the barbie name. So I was very surprised how good the movie (plot and animation) were. I read the other reviews about children being scared and dont agree. The villians were the same level of scary as any cartoon or disney movie out there. I would recommend this video to any barbie crazed kids like my 3 and 5 yr old girls are. My 8yr old nephew (definite nonbarbie fan) also sat transfixed and watched the whole movie, due to the great storyline and action. If it was a straight ballet movie I sure I would have lost all three! But with the story, dance and music combination its a great way to expose your kids to the ""classics"" Have a great christmas!"
4,This Was Alot Better Than I Thought It Would Be!,"I watched Barbie In The Nutcracker one Christmas when It was shown on TV and at first I thought that it was going to be really cheesy. I love playing with Barbie dolls but I thought the idea of Barbie movies sounded kind of dopey but that was until I watched this and wound up liking it ad finding out it was good and very entertaining and I have always liked the Nutcracker story so I enjoyed this! Give it a chance, it's pretty good!"
3,Not bad.It`s nice.But not good as Rapunzel.,"Well...I have got this Barbie movie last week.It was ok.I liked her dress,and her neckless.Well.....The mouse king is realy bad.There is a part in the movie I hated.When the mouse king makes a rock monster.This movie is not better then Barbie as Rapunzel.I liked Rapunzel more then this one.The story is more classical."
3,"For the kids, but still a solid effort","""Barbie In The Nutcracker"" is primarily for the kids. The music is fantastic and the computer-animated ballet sequences are great, but this is still a ""Barbie"" movie no matter how you look at it. I commend the ""Barbie"" people for using great production for the music and ballet, but the animation is a little bit square. Tim Curry is funny as the Mouse King, and the story did manage to hold my daughter's attention. She's two and one-half and didn't find the Mouse King too scary. None of the scenes in this flick are too scary as I recall. The other ""Barbie"" movies out there(a ""Rapunzel"" flick and ""Swan Lake"") have the same top-notch production that this movie has. They also share weak plots that won't hold an adult's attention.Keep in mind that this is strictly a children's movie. That's the only reason I'm giving it three stars. If I were a two or three year old girl, I'm sure I'd think this is the best movie ever."
1,No Captions/subititles,I was quite miffed when I discovered that this DVD didn't have any subtitles or captions. Thus pretty much rendering this title unwatchable with the thick accents.
4,Surprisingly emotional,"I watched the movie because of David Tennant. He was great although the colored contact lenses were rather distracting. The movie, like Casanova's life, is a lot of fun until it isn't. I enjoyed watching Casanova's antics. I was totally caught up in his pursuit of Henriette and Bellino. But when the turning point finally came, it changed how I saw those romps and I almost felt bad for how I'd admired his cheeky seductions. The film was more serious and poignant than I expected."
3,not a keeper,"was too long. David Tennant's mannerisms grate on you, early parts were funny, I never finished watching the whole show, have given it away. Not a keeper for me"
5,Multiple Generations,"I received this album free through iTunes, from a relative. Didn't realize not all songs were present. I'm buying this copy for my father (age 60) he loves it. It has a comfortable 60's sound to most songs. Worth the risk."
4,Just what we needed,I love the small size. It works well and doesn't drop out during startup of car.
3,Facinating but very old,"I had missed the point about the age of the program. Yes, this Nova program would have indeed been fascinating in 1987 or 1988, even in 1990. The science is very good, and the details are well explained. That is what the 3 Stars are for ! But this is a 18-19 year old program, and given the latest development in computer animation and the latest Hubble pictures, the old program left me wanting for more awesome pictures and graphics. I highly recommend this to those who really like to know about the discovery of Supernova 1987-A ! for the rest of us who like to be dazzled by starts and visual affects, this is not a very good program."
4,It's a real HOOT!,"I really enjoyed the music from this quirky show. My daughter performed in this show in college and I wanted to become familiar with the music. There's plenty of humor in the lyrics and you get a great feel for the show from what you hear. I especially loved ""Somebody ,"" ""Imagining You,"" and ""After Opening Night"". The play is over but I am still listening -- so if you're a fan of off-beat musicals, this one is a must-have!"
1,horrible,Company sent it with a sku sticker on the back which left adhesive all over it. I called the seller and she said she would send me a new one which i never received. Save your money
3,Returned,Although the pearls were beautiful they were returned as I was looking for white Akoya pearls and these had more of a pink tint.
5,Beautiful piece of leather workmanship,I was surprised how thin the wallet was even when it was filled with credit cards. I really like it. Perfect for all my frequent traveller cards.
4,Good Samples & Analysis,"Different from other essay collection books, it straightly starts with real sample essays & analysis, and both sample and analysis are great. What I like most of this essay, it removes the boring parts of some general direction on ""how to write essays."" Instead it has analysis of each essay, and it helps me to design my essay greatly. However, if someone needs the guideline of writing essay by each topic, he or she may need one more book."
3,Does not fit multiple wide knives,May not be suitable for everyone as the knife slots may not fit wide chefs knives or santoku knives very well. I had trouble fitting my MAC Chef's knife and santoku knife in the block and had to modify it...
4,"A ""Forest Gump"" Novel","The movie Forrest Gump was a huge success, even though Forrest ends up in the White House for Congressional Medal of Honor award, Ping Pong Master, etc. Talk about unbelievable coincidence(s)!What made the movie ""work"" is it was enjoyable to watch with plenty of historical stuff, and great period music of the time!We get to see John Lennon on a late night TV show with Forrest playing the straight guy; the tragedy's of the Vietnam War; Apple Computer making millionaires out of its early stock buyers; Nixon's downfall (Watergate) with Forrest saying to security... the flashlight's are keeping him awake!This book is Forrest Gump II (movie in the future?), enjoy the history and don't read it with a dead serious attitude that can't accept moocho coincidences or history lessons."
2,"Too, too shaming","Evelyn Waugh's most characteristic novel VILE BODIES would seem almost impossibly difficult to adapt for film; Stephen Fry tries here, and achieves much, but doesn't quite pull it off. Some of the characters from Waugh's novel are captured perfectly (particularly the desperate gossip columnist the Earl Balcairn, played here with real pathos and energy by the wonderful James McAvoy, and the gloomy wife of a prime minister, played all too briefly by Imelda Staunton), but others fall very wide of Waugh's mark. Many of the actors seems to be trying too hard, which is absolutely not in the spirit of the original novel. Fry makes the wild 30s parties seem far too much like their analogues from his contemporary experience, and he dooms the screenplay by providing it with a false romantic ending that goes grossly against the grain of Waugh's novel."
5,Great product.,A great product and it is so pretty can be used in serving. Cleans up nicely. It is heavy and cooks evenly.
1,WORST TEA IN THE WORLD!,"The reason most Americans don't like tea, is because at one time they had a cup of Lipton tea. It is bitter and tastes absolutely horrible.Try a good brand like Bigelow Darjeeling or Billy Tea."
5,Best video of this opera.,I have three different productions of this opera and this is the best of the three.However the other two are dvd.
2,Art history as seen by one man,"Paul Johnson has written a very personal view of the history of art. He makes some very interesting observations. Some of these are thought provoking and others are just plain silly. His ideas are worth considering for ancient art but they become so personal and opinionated for modern art, they can only be termed laughable. Another problem for me was that as an Englishman, the author seems to believe that the English have been a much greater influence in the development of art than they have, in fact been. Because there is no bibliography or footnotes, it is very difficult to tell when the author is providing his own opinions or citing accepted scholarship. If you hate most of the art of the last 150 years, you may find this book one that will bolster your ideas. The illustrations are all in color and are quite good. Many are works that do not appear in other books on art history."
5,unique prog rock,"prog, art, advant, whatever you want to call it, basically not your top 40. This, as well as their previous release, In Extremus, are gems if you are a fan of 20th century classical, progressive rock, jazz, or just something different. The musicianship is excellent. The songs are dense, layered, busy, and at times frightening, but somehow very contagious. At times resembles King Crimson, Gentle Giant, or Zappa. The singer (Deborah Perry) has a unique style and a good voice. I can't say enough about this band."
5,"Fun Helmet, my son loves it and wears it when hes a Viking!","Fun Helmet, my son loves it and wears it when hes a Viking! Horns just pop in and out so they twist around. Pretty durable not worried about ruff housing damaging it."
2,way too small,"Well the ring in the picture looked alot bigger than it was, way bigger. So am returning it because it was a gift for my wife and she could bairly see the diamonds in the ring."
3,Just average - misleading cover!,"Well, I start with the misleading cover. Judging by the faces of the actors one could say it must be a comedy. Unfortunately, the moments when you can laugh are really seldom. It's more drama.In a few words - it's yet another story about a guy who has problems with his own sexuality, thus he hurts everybody around.What I liked the most about this film, was the actress who played mother of the main gay character.There are parts in the screenplay that sound and look quite fake (for example the ending scenes, or the scenes with french rap music in background (he????french rap???).On the other hand, knowing the ability of US cinema makers to create real gay-theme nightmares, ""The one"" isn't entirely bad."
1,Good Production - Bad Movie,This movie has high production value and good acting. But the store is not any good. It is supposed to be a romantic comedy but it is more like a romantic tragedy. Not worth the money unless you just like to watch everything go down hill.
1,NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING AFTER PAYMENT,"Paid for the product (A book on calligraphy) for $36. Waited 2 weeks, absolutely no contact from this seller. Amazon emailed me stating they also cannot get this seller to confirm that they should have already received the payment. Now I'm awaiting a refund from a seller who isn't available. Waste of time buying for this seller."
2,"Actually, sorry for purchasing that","Well a do not believe this book is rated as 5-star. I do belive the author is extremly good caligraphy painter but this book is intended may be for really small kids at age like 5-10. Everything is explained in souch a simple and shallow way than nobody seriously interested can be satisfied. Sorry .. nice pictures but for sure.. This book does not have anythink but 10 pages in common with caligraphy. So if you are interested in calligraphy and not in creating smal simple gifts to your child friend dont byu it. But once again the book is not bad.. but badly described or may be I just chose it badly, any way I hope this can help otherst to buy or not to buy."
1,"Pretentious, long-winded, no story","This is a dreadful book, no story, no dialog. There are so many adjectives that you can use it as a theasuras. The author wasn't interested in telling a story, his main goal is to show off --whatever it is."
1,Lightening thing,i hated this product. my hair turned orange and i did everything right. I'm not the only one with problems with this product i just wished i'd talked to them first. i won't be using this again
2,I wish there were more stories,"I got this game the first day it came out. I have been playing the sims ever since the 1st sims game. Its really not worth the 40 dollar price tag for only 2 stories. After you are finshed with the stories, you then get to play in classic mode, witch is just the same as the oringal sims. If I were you, I would save my money and just go buy Seasons when it come out later this month."
2,Would probably burn well,"I found this book a presumtious, hypocritical waste of tree. I found his ideas to be heavily influenced by patriarchal society. This man should not be allowed to quote Tillich but since he did he should have at least done the man justice. His attempt to define the role of sexuality in these instances were meager. See Thomas Moore for an excellent look into sexuality and human relationships. Use this book for a coaster."
3,Not the best of Balogh,"I'm a huge Mary Balogh fan, but this one was a little flat. Viscount Whitleaf with the violet eyes is not the dashing enigmatic hero. All in all, worth reading, but it left me wanting the madcap energy of the other Balogh novels."
1,Simply Boring,"I am stuck in the middle of this book, in the middle of a chapter it is so boring. It took too many chapters just to get through the first day! Peter is too wimpy to stay in his own house and too timid to go after Susanna or admit love of any kind. Not even the momentary (and shallow) appearance of a few Bedwyns can't perk up this story. Save your money."
4,Great book,I love these very real charactors. I like the way they challenged each other to confront their demons.
3,GREAT buy for a Dwight lover.,"Basically, the book contains the lyrics to all the music he's written over the past 20 years. Aside from the short preface written by Dwight, you can get this information from the CD covers. But, if your a die-hard fan, (like I am), the money you spend is worth it for the 2 page preface."
2,Forget mystery..think Harlequin,"This book was scare on mystery/thriller, and long on cheesy romance. If I want romance, I'll reaad a Harlequin!"
3,"music's good, but we miss the inspiration","My husband and I have been fans of Susan Ashton's for years now, she has even performed in our church a few times. My husband bought me this for Christmas last year, and I have to say the first thing that surprised me was the picture of her on the front. Didn't look like the Susan Ashton that we saw in 1997. Anyway I must say that we were both rather disappointed that none of the songs on here are Christian. We like country music, and she does a good job of that, but we really miss the inspirational message that we usually find in her songs. I really hope that she is not another Amy Grant. Amy Grant may be worth $85 million, like the other reviewer mentioned, but I think that she's lost a whole lot more than that. There is so much more to life than fame and fortune. Please, Susan, listen to some of your earlier music and go from there. This album is good, but we know you can do better."
2,The cover was outstanding so I bought it,The cover is really hot of Susan Ashton. But the music fails to be similar than that. I only recognized one song on this album when I bought it and that is Your Lucky I love you I believe it was the only single off the whole thing. The music did not sound that country and it failed hardly to be good.
3,Tae Bo Workout,I'm a huge fan of the Tae Bo Advanced workouts so this product disappointed me a bit. It's not as intense as the advanced routines and at the end of some moves you are required to hold the pose (ie flex). This move may be effective but for someone who is relatively fit and enjoys constant movement in their workout this product may be a bit of a let down.
2,No thanks...,"I'm a beginner when it comes to exercise, and I decided to give Tae Bo a try after hearing so many positive things about it. I am not happy with this DVD. I found the pace and instruction confusing at times, leaving me frustrated rather than focused. Definately not for me."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"The book discusses how wonderful it will be when you finally get ""real"" but it doesn't explain how to get there. Buyer beware! There are better books out there."
2,cookbook,"The purchase arrived in a timely manner and I love the cookbook, however, the binder is broken and the pages keep falling out. Other than that, it is great."
3,Cook book,"The cookbook has some good recipes, but I wish I would have looked at it in the store before I purchased it. A lot of interesting information such as cuts of meat, types of pasta, etc., but the recipes didn't yell ""make me."""
5,Best all around cookbook,"BHG is the best all-around cookbook. I bought this one to replace my 20 year old Betty Crocker cookbook. It has all the great traditional recipes, plus new up to date ones. Good layout, nice pictures and easy to follow recipes. I also gave on e to my mom and she loves it. Good gift."
3,Birdsongs... Sweet!,"This is my first taste of ""Birdsongs"" music and I am taken with it. Many Progressive rhythms, elements of jazz, classical and rock. This is instrumental music. Sax, Guitar, Keyboards, Synths are delicate and percussions galore. Song lengths between 3 and 7 minutes in length. Beautiful shifting textures, flowing jazz lines, a little hip-hop beat now and then with a diverse range of percussive instruments. Only four members are listed although five others appear on the album, one of which, Roger Miller, was a former band member. The other four are percussionists.Fans of classical and jazz music may enjoy this album. At times is reminds me of Bill Brufords Earthworks (first album, at least). Prog-metal fans might have a hard time understanding it. The guitar lines are rich and tasteful, never bombastic, occassionally Holdsworthian."
2,Two reasons to buy this DVD - Keith & Keith.,"First let me say that I agree with the other reviews. Most tracks are lip synced, etc. However, it does offer a rare glimps of a young Keith Moon attacking the drums and a rare glipms of a young Keith Emerson (in The Nice) attacking the piano. The Keiths are great, the rest is throw away. I'm giving one star per Keith...."
5,A very entertaining documentary,Return to Florence is a story about an art school in Florence Italy. The film focuses on the eccentric characters who revolve around the school -- especially the school's director. It is very funny at times but also has many introspective moments. The film is worth it for the beautiful images of florence alone.
5,WHY ISN'T THIS AVAILABLE ON DVD YET?,"If anyone has a way of contacting the production company about this DVD, I'm sure alot of people would be interested in purchasing it---we're waiting--please hurry up!!"
4,A beautiful piece,"I received this tea kettle as a Christmas gift, and it looks beautiful on my stovetop, and although I've used it a few times, I think it may be more for looks than function. The handle doesn't move and is fixed in an upright position. It heats water very quickly on my gas stove, but that wooded handle gets really hot when the water in the kettle comes to a boil. I just get the feeling that I'll need to treat this item very gently - certainly no high heat - in order to preserve it."
3,Joker's coin,"Doesn't look real, but good for little ones that like to trick each other. Also good stocking stuffers for Christmas."
4,Chicago Cutlery - import knife set,"Purchased this knife set on a ""Friday Sale"" - so price was a major factor. I was not expecting much and they certainly do not compete with Wusthof, but they are decent full tang knives and at the sale price they were a real bargain. They WILL NEED sharpening before any serious use. They come with the typical factory quickie sharpened edge, but it will dull remarkedly fast. And like any good quality steel knife - DO NOT throw them into the dishwasher ! Hand wash and they should last a long time."
2,Not up to par,"Page 1 says, ""I poured myself a seconf cup of tea>"" The conversation continues in the same setting and on page 4 the author writes, ""I took a sip of my cold coffee."" Very sloppy proof reading, if nothing else. The plot is about as interesting as her cold coffe. The descriptions of the countryside of Indiana are well crafted. If you are snowed in and received this book as a gift it is good for an afternoon read."
1,Utter Nonsense,"I'd like to see the empirical evidence of all the geniuses created using this approach-- apparently the author was not one of them. Nothing of substance, just attempts to use the power of suggestion and ""preconscious processing"" to magically allow people to think themselves into being smarter-- with minimum effort. As ridiculous as the same author's Photo-Reading system which claims to allow people to ""unconsciously"" read up to 25,000 words per minute. I'd like to see proof of these claims in a double-blind study-- not just a bunch of worthless anecdotes and quotes from unreliable sources. This kind of rehashed snake oil is both damaging and insulting. Save your money, save your time."
1,"Foolosh, silly book","This book is pure nonsense, and mostly the author's imagination. Several claims are made without an iota of empirical evidence. In essense the author claims that suggestion and ""preconscious processing"" will somehow magically allow people to think themselves into being smarter. In Photo-Reading, people are asked to just thumb through pages of a book without actually reading it; somehow ""unconsciously"" you get to absorb all the material. Please save your money and time."
2,terrible and too thin.,"I bought this bracelet for my boyfriend. He loved it, but that didn't last long because after just a few wears, it was so scratched up and dull looking it looked terrible. The gold overlay is just way too thin."
3,gold overlay is just way too thin.,"I bought this bracelet for my boyfriend. He loved it, but that didn't last long because after just a few wears, it was so scratched up and dull looking it looked terrible. The gold overlay is just way too thin."
2,disappointed,"Bracelet is small like other reviews have said. That was one of the reasons I bought it though as I have a small wrist. While the fit is fine for me, the color is not. It looks like a very cheap bracelet which it is but I expected more especially with some of the reviews that I had read about it. Oh well, you get what you pay for. Not worth sending back."
5,I love it,"Small,yes but for the prize,u'd not regret buying it one bit. I love it cos its gold and it suits my dressing... Trust me,its really nice. Arrived quick and it's worth the wait!"
5,Lipstick,I love this max factor lipfinity lipstick. I only have to apply once in the morning and it will stay on all day. Its definitly worth the price.
5,Wonderful Depiction of a Wonderful Person,"I recently viewed the video of ""84 Charing Cross"" for the first time. Then I read ""Q's Legacy."" What a fine sequence to discover Helene Hanff. Such a wonderful person she must have been. She appeared to be quite comfortable with herself and even at ease with her own bit of fame. This book is an extension of her heart. I recommend it wholeheartedly and without reservation."
2,poorly done and not worth the money,I was very disappointed with this video. I could have made the same thing on my computer using powerpoint. But what frustrated me most was that the images and the narration were not in sync. The image would change while the narrator was still talking about the previous painting. Only redeeming grace is that is shows a broad spectrum of Picasso's work.
4,Christmas fun for singing kids,"Wonderful footage directly out of the TV specials. However, would love to have more (this is a fairly short video)"
1,Too Small,"The construction of this product is very good, however it is too small to fit your pet in comfortably under the airline seat unless you have a 3lb pet. I have a 7 pound chihuahua which flys with me often and he could barely fit in this carrier because the back angles down taking away from the space, also with the pad inside took away even more space. If this carrier did not angle down in the back and was maybe an inch or 2 longer it would be the perfect airline carrier."
2,Warning : Nice Bag - but it's not 1 pound as described.,"I ordered this bag to carry my pet onboard an aircraft, When I read the description I assumed it was Ultra-Light, A one pound bag.... After I got the bag I weighed it at the airport and discovered its approx. 4 pounds! - Again it's a great bag, But the Airline companies have weight restrictions. - Be warned if your pet is close to the weight limit this may not be the right bag for you."
3,The hint of things to come,"The Easybeats were such a fantastic group it is hard to believe that they left the music world with such a whimper. Aside from a few good tracks (""St. Louis,"" ""Can't Find Love"" and ""Watching the World (Go By)"") and the absolutely great ""Rock n Roll Boogie,"" the material on this 1969 album is half-baked and usually half-finished. Some of the tracks, like the loungish ""I Love Marie,"" just make me wince. However, the album is an interesting pointer to Vanda/Young's next phase, their boogie/soul alter ego Marcus Hook Roll Band. Still, I can't help wondering whether the group even authorized this release.This release is rescued by the 11 additional tracks. Some of them are unnecessary alternative versions of ""Good Friday"" tracks but many of them are great Central Sound songwriting demos. They put the whole of ""Friends"" to shame. These additional tracks are the reason to buy this CD."
5,Simply The Best CD of 1999,"And not just country either... Vince finally rids himself of the 5 or 6 crossover songs that have appeared on every effort since ""I Still Believe in You"" and gets down to bare-knuckles country music. The music of Conway, Willie, Hank and Monroe; not Billy Dean, Reba and the Anti-Hank Garth Brooks. This is it, a return to the roots that have insired Gill from the beginning. You get the full range in this album, gut wrenching ballads like ""If You Ever Have Forever In Mind"", a great Conway-Loretta like duet with Patty Loveless and a great Texas shuffle on ""I'll Take Texas"". This is the most complete CD by a mainstream country artist in years, and Gill's best since ""When I Call Your Name"". The best CD of 1999 and the best Country CD of the decade."
5,Funny,This movie is so fun. It is a family movie. I bought this to finish my collection of Beethoven. Highly recommend.
2,Region 1 DVDs,"The company sent me a DVD marked ""Universal"" rather than Region 1 which is the Region that is used in North America and Canada. I ordered the DVD for my son and he has a Samsung DVD player. All Samsung DVD players will only play ""Region 1"" DVD's. The DVD would not play at all. I had to return the DVD."
3,Chronicle of Unitas and Colts from old school sportswriter,"Traces history of Unitas and the Baltimore Colts from the early 50's and the two NFL Championships in '58 and '59 through the Championship loss in Cleveland in 1964 including the '69 and '70 Superbowls up until Johnny leaves for San Diego in 1973. Continues on with Unitas experiencing retirement to his passing on Sept 11, 2002. Championship games described as though you are watching from play to play. Nifty 40 page interview with Unitas and author concludes prose portion. 40 more pages of Unitas' stats follows that. Book also includes material on Colts move from Baltimore and Ravens appearance. Fans of football and Baltimre Colts will enjoy reliving the memories. 16 pages of great photos. Required reading for any true Baltimore Colts fan."
3,I can take it or leave it.,Well...it's okay but not worth the time I waited for it's release. The first time I heard about Vol. 3 was at the Flash Forward 2004 Conference in San Francisco. I really looked forward to Billy Bussey and Shane's Chapter's but when I read them they did not have the substance I thought it would pack. Shane gave a few nuggets as far as techniques but it was mostly philosophical garbage (as with many other contributors of the book) that could have been left for an autobiography rather than a book that is geared towards actually teaching the customer something. I would say get the book for some decent tidbits but you would probably get more out of the first volume.
3,"Good basics, but old data","Caswell et al have a nice, short summary of the some of the high points of the ag biotech industry. They touch on a lot of subjects in a short period of time, so the reader gets a good dose of general information but can also be wanting for more. Interestingly, for a 2003 book, there is very little data or literature cited after 1993. Recommend reading if you can check it out of the library, but not if you need to spend money for it."
4,"Good information for beginners, like me.","My friend and I have started cutting hair on our spare time, to make a little extra money. This great book was very informative and it contained many easy to follow step by step instructions. Not only does it offer basic cutting tips, but it offers great styling tips as well. Yes, it's for beginners, but we found it helpful and we're applying what we learned from this book on a daily basis, in our new part-time job as stylists. If you already know how to cut hair, then you'll probaly have no use for this book, but if your a rookie, you'll really find it helpful."
1,Not for beginners!,This book is for someone who has training in cosmetology. Very disappointing and confusing for someone who is new to cutting hair and wanted step by step instruction that the other reviewers talked about. What you see in the example cut (the page shown here on the web when it says look in this book) is all the insturction that you get for each of the cuts in this book.
3,The Future Sound of the World,"Only in ""revisted"" Chicago would two labels (Cajual & Relief) release two compilations in two years. This is a testament to the diversity of the artists on both labels. It should be a well known fact that Cajual was geared more towards songs while Relief was geared more towards tracks. So what's the score here? A clever compilation of tracks from both labels -- not many words, just grooves and beats. The majority of the titles here are from Relief, making it a more tracky affair. Not my most favorite compilation but if you just want to dance this will serve that purpose. If you're a trackhead this is definately your album!"
5,A Smaller Version for Precision Work,"It happens sometimes you would take a test where you have a small space to write calculations on and you could shortly run out of space. A 0.7 would consume that space and would make it difficult for you to fit in words and numbers neatly in your drawings. With the PS535 not only could you fit any calculations, diagrams, flowcharts and the like into a small space, you can write anything in between lines and corners with great neatness but without the greater effort. Your work looks neat. Earns you extra credit. Why?The pencil is extremely thin to handle and furthermore there is a retractable sleeve that leads the pencil lead to EXACTLY where you want it to be. You can pack your writing neatly into a small space without congesting the space and give your work a professional cut.Two things to know in advance, this pencil is not for sticking in the pocket, the clip does not look very strong, but that is my estimation. Superb workmanship from Pentel again."
1,The most pitiful live album even remotely associated with Hawkwind,Abysmal sound. Abysmal playing. Repeated tracks. Yet sold at full price with an apology that it will be re-released with a corrected version so we lucky people can buy it twice. Except I'm not that insane and I didn't!
1,Magic Bullet Theory,"On Rush's recommendation I quickly read this book this afternoon. That was mistake. Unfortunately Mr. Hayes regurgitates the same ol' stuff that he has been peddling on behalf of Doug Feith and Ahmed Chalabi for the past year. The vast majority of his assertions have been debunked publicly and often so I will not waste anyone's time.Hayes includes absolutely no evidence that anything at all ever came of the handful of odd contacts between Al Qaida and Bathist Iraq. (And several of those meetings never took place according to US intel and law enforcement. It's upsetting that Hayes seems to assert that both the CIA and FBI, by ommission, are accidental agents of Saddam. Those folks are not deserving of these backhanded smears!) His work is purely conjecture based upon tenuous evidence.This book has more in common with Oliver Stone's JFK than with reality. The connection is just one big ""Magic Bullet""."
1,A Mediocre Mind panders to the right for a bone,Stephen F. Hayes is the definition of a mediocre mind. Flimsy research and half cocked theories are lumped together so that people like Hannity and Limbaugh can quote a book to support their lies.
1,Ha!,"No source material? F. Never ever read a non-fiction book written without a list of sources. Conservative, Liberal, whatever. If they can't back up what they say, they're telling fairy tales."
3,Missing the Point,"Is there or isn't there an actual connection? We won't really know until we get Saddam or Osama to admit it which will never happen. What we do know is that Saddam funded suicide bombers in Israel ($25K to each 'volunteer's' family) is it that much of a strech to think Saddam wouldn't fund that same activity in the US if he thought he could get away with it? Secondly, WMD or no WMD, Saddam had a large conventional arsenal. It only takes Saddam giving one S.A.M. to a terrorist to bring down a plane. And finally the cold, hard fact is that it is better for road side bombs to go off in Baghdad than in LA."
1,Strictly for the Black Helicopter crowd.,"For a book that purports to claim a link between Saddam and al Qaeda, a lack of footnotes and attribution of sources is a disturbing sign - and how about at least an index?Just by saying a `source said' means nothing - was it from Ahmed Chalabi or a minion from the Iraqi National Congress (now officially discredited)? Clearly the author knows nothing about how intelligence is gathered and professionally analyzed sans political influenceIn all, this book is for the Black Helicopter crowd and those who still think Bush invaded Iraq because it posed a clear and impending threat to the United States"
2,Grainy photograps.,"Some of these weren't even yoga poses. The photos were amateurish. I might have liked a few if the photographer would have known something about black and white photography, the lighting was really off."
5,Burning Brightly,"A collection of unreleased bits and pieces may seem like it is going to be un-essential and possibly inferior to ""proper"" albums but this is a trully wonderful collection crammed full of surprizes, beauty and humour. There are gorgeous alternative stripped down session versions of Rock Bottom tracks including the sensual super-love track Sea Song, recent collaborations with old collaborator Hugh Hopper and LOTS of other goodies. It also features one of Wyatt's most daring recordings Little Child. This track is a reading of an old overtly sentimental Danny Kaye song, remembered from Wyatt's childhood. Wyatt performs the parts of father and child in character voices split with extreme stereo panning. Wyatt's sincerity stops the piece being just a funny curiosity OR too slushy to bare. Lttle Child is profoundly moving. For that unique track alone this is a MUST have but as I said before there is so much great stuff on this C.D."
3,Its OK,"I've been using this opener for 5 months, its opened every bottle quickly and easily (a lot of bottles), no pushed down corks, no broken corks, and its still in one piece. Overall though its obvioulsy cheaply constructed and doesn't look as good as I would have hoped (it looks as cheap as it feels). Right out of the box I recognized it for weak construction so I've just been carful with it, and its worked just fine."
3,Edited Version / Censorship Sucks!,"I absolutely love R. Kelly's music and have been anxiously awating the release of a Greatest Hits compilation. I give this release 3 out of 5 possible stars. I was EXTREMELY disappointed that the only version available to us consumers is an EDITED version. That absolutely sucks! Whether it be some stupid marketing strategy or whatever, they should at least have offered the EXPLICIT version to those fans of his that want to hear the music in it's original, UN-edited format. I was also very disappointed that one of his best songs ever recorded, ""The Storm Is Over Now,"" (from TP-2.com) was omitted from this compilation. Overall though, a great cd...but still, the bonus cd does NOT make up for this release being EDITED."
5,Cop this one,"A previous reviewer complained about some tracks that were on this set. Considering that Kelly has so many hits, that is fair enough coz not everything can be fit on one volume. However to say that ""Sex Me"" is a filler and not a hit is totally wrong. It was R&B top 10, Pop top 20 and went Gold. In fact it charted higher than ""Dedicated"" which the reviewer insisted should have made it on the cd. Also ""Fiesta"" remix was indeed one of Kelly's biggest hits, being an R&B # 1 and pop #6, and was named the most popular (chart wise) R&B/Hip Hop song of 2001 by Billboard themselves. The songs from Born Into The 90s that made it here are also justified. ""Honey Love"" was the first of the R.'s 10 R&B #1 hits and ""She's Got That Vibe"" was the song that gave him his initial worldwide popularity. Every song on this set is contemporary R&B at its greatest and deserves to be on vol. 1 and I totally recommend this to any new or longtime R&B fan. Bring on BOBW2, The Secret album and R. In R&B Vol. 2!!!"
3,2-Disc set too much of a good thing,"Just make a comilation of these songs, and you will own his REAL greatest hits collection!!!(record them in this order)1) Bump N Grind2) Your Body's Callin'3) Dedicated4) You Remind Me of Something5) Down Low6) I Can't Sleep Baby7) Gotham City8) When a Woman's Fed Up9) If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time(ode to Kobe Bryant...J/K)10)I'm Your Angel(with Celine Dion)11) I Believe I Can Fly12) I Wish13) Ignition (Remix)14) The World's Greatest15) Soldier's HeartRecord these songs, in this order. It doesn't get better than this. Don't overload this album with too much of a good thing. Only Kelly's Great songs."
4,Great computer for the price,"This replaced our 10 year old computer. Needless to say, the speed is fantastic, and we love the XP home operating system. The computer is very quiet and works perfectly. We may consider adding another 512 MB Ram Memory, but so far no problem. The unit comes with some easy to use software, like SONIC for burning CD's. We tossed out most of the trial version software) and installed our Office 2000 discs. The only small surprise was the outdated wheel mouse, no big deal, we purchased an optical mouse at Wal-Mart for under $10. We were glad NOT TO HAVE THE VISTA operating system, because some of our software will not run on VISTA. So we are very happy with the computer and the low price. We even got free shipping."
2,a good first yoga dvd....for someone else!,"i consider myself a beginner yogi (have been to about 5-7 classes over the past year), and i found this video to be extremely unchallenging. this video might be good for someone recovering from an injury AND who has never tried yoga before. although sara ivanhoe comes off as a friendly, non-threatening gym buddy, i just couldn't overcome the total lack of breath awareness that seems to be a basic part of yoga. also, i am not in very good shape, and i didn't even break a sweat during the 'fat burning' workout."
1,Way too easy,"I've been practicing yoga for a long time, and after reading all of the possible reviews, this one seemed like the most intense/real. It's not. It's WAY too easy to be a workout."
5,I love this workout!,I simply love this workout! I have been practicing yoga on and off for more than 15 years and this workout left me feeling fresh lively. I could feel that my body was working hard! Thanks for a great yoga DVD - I liked the presentation of the trainer and the details and tipos she provided about breathing is very helpful. I would surely recommend this to any friend.
2,Not flexible? Not for you.,"I bought this DVD as a beginner's intro to Yoga. I have done Yoga meditation before, but this was more of a real workout. Both workouts on this tape are pretty strenuous. The Joy of Yoga is pretty difficult because you have to already be flexible to do many of the positions. Even the modified version is pretty difficult. The woman doing the modified poses is obviously very advanced. I suppose it could get easier with time, but it is doubtful I will ever be able to do every position.The Fat Burning Yoga workout instructor is a little better at explaining the positions. I was able to do 90% of the poses in this part of the DVD-- at least the modified version. Still, the modifications are not that different from the regular workout.I would say this tape is more for seasoned stretchers-- You have to be pretty darn flexible to get the maximum workout from this tape.I have also bought the Crunch Pick your spot Pilates tape. That is a really good workout-- even for beginners."
1,disappointing for intermediate-level yoga fan,"I thought that this would be a fast-paced and strenuous workout, but it is far too slow. Also, the instructor never stopped talking, which I found extremely distracting and annoying. I think this would be a better workout for novices, who need instruction on form and more time to get into the feel of a pose. I will try to find someone to give this DVD to; all I can say is that at least I only blew [a little cash] on this one.I far prefer my Power Yoga: The Complete Workout with Rodney Yee (flowing poses with minimal yakking)--although it is definitely for someone who is already familiar with basic yoga poses."
5,THESE GOGGLES SOLVED MY PROBLEM!,Got these in polarized brown lenses. I'm petite and these goggles fit great.Reason I bought them is to protect my face from extremely windy conditions up here in the Oklahoma country prairies while I run in the winter time. Protection offered by the lenses is awesome for glare and visibility is still great at the end of day or during gloomy days. The way you adjust the straps by sliding the 2 buckles closer or farther apart is very handy as well. Goggles are lightweight enough to run in them and don't fog up.
1,rubber Band broken,After a while using it I noticed the rubber part of the band was broken so I needed to change. The rest of the wacth is nice.
4,Very Strong! A bit high of a price tag though,This is a great magnet and holds my very heavy oversized calendar. I think maybe this can be found much cheaper though since it seems a bit overpriced. Next time I'm in the market for one like this I will probably shop around a little better.
3,Too expensive,"I ordered this for a family gathering at Christmas. Although it was fun, it is way too expensive for what it is. I would not order it again unless it came way down in price."
3,A little slow in places,"I dove into Borderlords with high hopes immediately after finishing Carry the Wind. The first half of this book, though, seemed to drag forever as Titus Bass relived moments from the first book while making a trek to Vancouver to exorcise the ghost of Asa McCafferty. I'm still not sure I understand the point of all that. The second half of the book, though, really picks up steam and saved it from getting a two-star review from me. Although I still have to say there was way too much talking during that climactic knife fight. Shut up and start stabbing! Overall, it was an enjoyable book that finished on a high note that will bring me back for more of the series."
1,Lasted 5 minutes,What a complete waste of cash. The belt literally lasted 5 minutes of light duty sanding. I had my suspicions from the get go as it was a tad undersized and took some work to install. I will be looking elsewhere for a replacement this go round. Don't waste your cash on this one.
5,Sturdy OEM replacement,"I go through these belts fairly often and of all the different replacement belts I've used, these are the best."
4,Easy-Use Tent,"This tent is extremely easy to assemble. I assembled it by myself on a windy day with no trouble, and selected this tent to assemble in the dark on a late arrival camping trip because it goes up in about 5 minutes. As with most tents, I wouldn't recommend trying to fit the advertised number of persons in the tent (particularly if they are all adults) because it is a very tight fit. I use this tent regularly, and it is very durable. I do love that an adult can stand up straight in the tent, which makes changing and moving around a little easier. I haven't been able to get the solar panel to work yet, but that might be my own fault due to a rechargeable battery problem."
4,Good medium level workout,"I started out with the Basic Workout and I'm really enjoying this new Taebo Cardio. It never stops you moving, so you really sweat like hell. It also works a lot on abs, making it ideal to flatten out that tummy.My only complaints are:-the setting: I prefered the setting of older videos, that looked more like a normal gym. This ""studio/fancy"" setting just seems a bit unnatural to me-preaching: Billy gets in preaching mode towards the end of the video, talking a bit too much about motivations and goals, but your mileage may vary.Overall it's a really good fitness video, I recommend it."
2,Not for those already in shape,"I'm in decent shape and exercise regularly. I was looking for an exercise video that would help break up the monotony of running, pushups etc. The intensity of this video is fit for beginners. I think even people of intermediate fitness levels would be disappointed with this one. I've done other Tae Bo videos that are much more strenuous, and more fun. The Tai Chi type cool down on this, and the other Tae Bo videos I've tried doesn't really do much for me either. Go with this one only if you're a beginner."
5,Great as a beginning or intermediate Tae Bo workout,"I have been doing Tae Bo for years now, and am at the advanced level. If you are like me, this workout will not be challenging. I gave it to a girlfriend who was in pretty good shape, but hadn't ever done Tae Bo. She loved it and thought it was a great workout. Bottom line: this DVD is best for people who have been doing some other form of exercise but are just beginning Tae Bo, and for those looking for an intermediate level Tae Bo workout."
3,Ignore the cheesy-ness and just work out,"I needed a good cardio workout for rainy days that I couldn't make to the gym. Someone recommended this video, and even though I'd never tried Tae Bo, I ordered it. While does get my heart pumping, Billy Blanks has trouble discerning right/left for camera viewers. So it took a few tries to get the moves down so that I didn't pause between each set. Plus, there is this crazy-abs scary chick counting the steps the whole time. She'll grunt or cheer after so many counts, and it is a bit disturbing. Overall, the video has a cheesy effect, but can be motivational if you get in the ""zone"" and just work out. My heart rate stayed above 165 for about 25 minutes of the workout, which was my goal."
4,Worth Buying,"It's a good tape.I highly recommend this tape for an ""intermediate."" I have done several of Billy Blank's tapes, including his advanceTae-Bo. I thought the pace of the Cardio was very good."
4,Great Cardio Workout,"I started using the Billy Banks (basics) Tae Bo tapes, but as time progressed I needed something a bit more challenging. This Cardio workout is a step above the basics, because it's longer. It allows you to get a more advanced workout without over doing it. Some moves seem a bit fast, but you don't have to go at their pace. Just do the same routine, but with slower moves, and soon you'll work your way up to quicker moves.I really like it. I alternate with the Billy Banks Lower Body workout too. That one literally kicks my butt! Both leave me feeling energized."
3,Taebo Cardio,"This Taebo Cardio workout is just ok to me. I thought it was kinda slow to be effective enough for a good cardio workout. I personally like the Taebo Amped workouts a lot better. They really get you sweating and pumped up, especially with the amplifier."
4,"Great workout, just not intense enough for me.","I started my tae-bo journey with the fat-blasting cardio dvd. So I came in the door with a high intensity workout. This is the dvd I put in on days I dont feel like working out, but I still get a good workout. The good thing about this dvd is, it is easy for beginners to follow along. As a previous reviewer mentioned, you will not accidentally throw out your shoulder with this one. The warm up and cool down are longer than the other dvds(about 20 mins total I think) and the other half is the cardio. Alot of the moves on here are on the fat blasting cardio dvd, but you do them slower. He did add a few new moves though. Overall you get a great workout without a major strain on your body. I am a beginner and this was EASY for me. So I recommend this to the beginner and the advanced if you want to work up a good sweat, burn calories and get in shape!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I consider myself a ""skinny"" person but I wanted more muscle tone which is why I bought this video. I did Tae-Bo Cardio 5x per week for 4 weeks and well, I saw little if any results. I didn't get as toned as I would have liked (barely noticeable) and doing this video day after day was mind numbing. I don't know how I lasted for 4 days let alone 4 weeks."
4,Great workout!,"This is great if you don't have time to do a full 1 hour workout. It's about 45 minutes including the warm-up and stretching sections. It's not too strenuos nor to simple. You do need a reasonable area to exercise in. The only thing that bothered me was the way Billy miscounts and mis-reads his right and left moves. But he does it in all his videos/dvds. If you have his other workouts, you know what I'm referring to. Overall, I'd recommend this dvd."
3,monimw,"This video is not for advanced or experienced tae-bo users. I found this video to be very slow paced and boring for me. However, if you are new to tae-bo and need a step up from the very basic instructional videos this would be a good start.Also, some reviewers complain that Billy doesn't cue for right and left according to mirroring. Come on now folks! Are you serious? You can't look at the screen and figure out right from left? Seriouly, that is a silly complaint. Also, it doesn't matter if you do the same side or if you mirror him - just be consistent with each move so that you don't do all your reps on one side. It's not that hard."
5,Configuring firewall for windows.,"Well i think this book explains everything there is to know about ISA server. Configuring an ISA was always pain in the neck though, i gotta admit though before i've finished this book, reconfiguring an ISA server took me much longer, now i do it within 2 hours. I like this book, though i think author could make it much shorter, i don't think some one actually cares where ISA server got from and the history of it's design, but again that's only my opinion. It has a DVD with it i think, i never went through it or anything, so i wouldn't know what's on it. This book can teach you how to make a proxy, a gateway and or a firewall out of ISA server. (That's what it's about though)"
5,100% pure brilliance,"Over and over the fleshtones have reminded me how great it is to be alive-- this record is no exception and rocks hard. ""smash crash"", ""i'm not a sissy"", and ""dig in"" are pure joy... and do not miss out on seeing this legendary band live, they transcend rock n' roll and will alter your state of conscious and change your life-- forever."
1,"For the Love of the Dollar, by Michael Jordan","While trying to affirm his greatness as a player and thank the fans at the same time, Jordan simply cashes in on the book, gets someone else to write it, and sleeps on his bed of shredded $100 bills, lighting a cigar with a Twenty. This book is a perfect example of why I am no longer a Bulls fan."
5,Michael Jordan's honesty is captivating.,"I am a huge Michael Jordan fan, like many others. I have read everything about him from ""Hang Time, Days and Dreams with Michael Jordan,"" to ""The Jordan Rules"" and I found this to be the best. The honesty with which Michael expresses his thoughts is unmatched by anything I've ever seen. I am very greatful for the opportunity to have read it. To all of you non-Jordan fans out there, maybe you should read it to see what you're missing."
4,MICHAEL JORDANS LIFE,"I READ THIS BOOK AND I THOUGHT IT WAS DECENT, IT WAS GOOD FOR ONE OF HIS BOOKS, BUT I MEAN YOU COULD READ AND THINK THIS IS THE SAME THING THAT IS IN EVERY BOOK WITH ""AIR"" JORDAN. I ONLY BOUGHT TO COMPARE IT TO THE OTHER BOOKS ABOUT HIM. IF YOU WANT A GOOD BIOGRAPHY BUY ""BAD AS I WANNA BE"" THAT IS A GREAT BOOK."
3,Are these the light cheapie ones?,"I lost my original stylus that came w/ my palm. (or should I say, my son, who was playing a game on it, lost it.) Either way, I was using my fingernail to use my palm until I got a 3-pack for Christmas from my fiance'. I was very grateful for such a needed thing, but in all honesty the ones I got were VERY light (the original one was a lot heavier) and they feel maybe hollow or something.I was wondering if these specific ones are the EXACT same as the original one. I read on here a couple of people said it was just like the original, but I just want to make sure before I spend a ridiculous amount of money. (I saw on another web site they were only $4 for a 3-pack, but maybe those are like the ones I got for Christmas.)Don't get me wrong, they work fine, but I miss the original one I had...."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I picked this book up at the grocery store in a moment of desperate boredom. I was expecting, well... I don't tend to expect much out of books I get from the grocery store in sheer desperation of something to read.Her world is wonderfully detailed and thought out. It has a number of classic fantasy elements, and lots of foreshadowing. As I read it I found I enjoyed the foreshadowing, as it seemed intentional, as opposed to being merely predictable due to bad writing. I particularly love the fact that the characters are not black and white, but all shades of gray. They don't automatically know right from wrong. Some people seem to like that tired stereotype that can be found in almost any other fantasy novel, but I personally find it boring.In conclusion, I can't wait for her to write a sequel."
4,The Indian Device,"This is not a bad book. It is very Indian centered and is not an unbiased source. I used it for my thesis and it was a valuable source of information, but I also had to use other sources which offered a more unbiased opinion."
3,"ok, but not the best body sculpting from FIRM","Although the videos in this particular BSS series are good, they aren't as challenging as previous or especially the newer BSS 3 & 4 series. Total Sculpt's flow of exercises doesn't keep your heart rate up enough - especially for advanced exercisers. Maximum Cardio has one of the hardest ab segments at the end, but the cario portion needs to be bumped up to another level - very beginner oriented. Complete Aerobics and WEights is a great workout tape - keeps your heart rate up and the sculpting is tough. Ab Sculpt is again, more for the beginner exerciser."
2,It's ........Alright,"I am a serious gamer, not for xbox 360,or ps3, but for gamecube i personally think its the best system out there, ANYWAYS when i first got this controller it seemed like any other ""offical"" gamecube controller, but its not after a couple weeks of playing super smash bros, the top control sticks padding came of , a couple weeks after that the c stick broke of completely I would reccomend this controller for a casual gamer but if your serious like i am its worth it to buy a better quality controller for an extra 10$. dont get third party. Thankyou"
2,I didn't know it was in French,"The music is very nice, but the words are in French. No other reviewer revealed this information, I guess I should have known, but I didn't. Since I don't understand the words, it is difficult listening."
5,Delicious,I have been drinking green tea for years and thought I would try something a little different. This product makes a wonderful cup of tea. I have shared with a few people and with one exception everyone loves it. Best with honey!
2,not what I would call green tea with brown rice though,I have tried this tea and was disappointed. The taste of green tea was there though. I was looking forward to actual tea leaves AND actual roasted brown rice to nibble on.
5,Fabulous Product!,"This is the PERFECT lipstick/stain. It wears forever! I use it for performances and it looks just as good several hours later. You will need a lipstick brush to get to the very bottom. But what cosmetic fiend doesn't have one of those??!! Just a very nice indulgence at a very nice price, too!"
1,So it's finally come to this,"I have nothing against reaggae, in fact I like reagae. BY ITS SELF. now Pink Floyd on the other hand is truley great music, as are Led Zepplin, AC/DC, Aerosmith,CCR, the list goes on. but anyway, Dark Side of the Moon is one of the greatest albums of all time and to do something like this to it is a travesty, a sham and a mockery(not to copy the Miller lite guy of course) in fact I refuse to believe that this is happening. I DON'T WANT YOU TO MAKE PINK FLOYD ""FRESH"" THEY WERE DOING JUST FINE BY THEMSELVES!!!!!!!!!!! just please PLEASE for the love of all things holy don't do this to The Wall."
5,stunning,"I just DJed a party briefly in laf. colorado, tossed on TIME and many happy smiles. Stunning cover, captures the spirit and adds a wicked vibe, big ups!!!!!!!!!!!ironfeather out & about!"
2,some weird choices,"It's always easy to criticize somebody's personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars, but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable ACTRESSES and not STARS of the studio era. So it comes pretty natural to ask : Is Esther Williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook Margaret Sullavan? Was Grace Kelly's talent so overwhelming to forget that Miriam Hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as Lubitsch, Wyler, Mamoulian, Hawks and Vidor to stunning results? What was wrong with Mary Astor's acting and what is right with Kim Novak's ?Actress to me means Patricia Neal or Shelley Winters - Norma Shearer or Natalie Wood were stars....think about it."
5,Sami and Ali= Now I Like Both,"I just finished this awesome book and took away from it some very valuable life lessons. Ali is mature way beyond her years and her true sense of self comes shining through in this book. I had only really known her through her role as Sami, and I can tell that she shares with me an intrigue toward a character that you love to hate. I just hope that Ali will do a follow-up book down the road so we can get her outlook on motherhood, post-pregnancy weight, etc."
2,"Flawed, but worthy of a watch.","This film is a low-budget tale of a small-time fence and police informer who cannot seem to successfully deal with a corrupt police department, and with his friends. Some good acting is managed along with sporadically interesting direction, and oftimes creative camerawork, despite a trite and muddled script. William McNamara's principal expression (deer in headlights), is appropriate for his part, while Jay Acovone steals each scene in which he appears in this work, filmed completely within that assault upon the senses, Los Angeles' Skid Row. Attempts at humour are welcome, but a better script would have been necessary to make this an artistic success."
3,some good pop music of its time.,"John Paul Young was known for bright pop tunes and this cd covers them,excepting for one missing composition of his called ""the painting""(a great ballad)which should have been on this best-of cd.All in all,an album of commercial pop tunes with a couple of disco ones thrown in."
3,Wait for the REAL Battleizer,"I havent bought this toy, but I am not going to. Just wait for the real battleizer."
2,Paper-thin novel,"The characters in this novel are about as deep as a puddle. If you want superficial, annoying or sarcastic and cynical this is for you. I wish I had brought something else on my vacation - I eventually had to watch the Disney Channel for something of substance."
1,B O R I N G!,"Every once in awhile I break out of my rut, read a novel, quickly remember why I don't like novels, and go back to non-fiction.Reading ""Company"" achieved this in record time - it was totally boring, almost from page one. Describing floors numbered upside-down, the case of the missing donut, finding out what the company's mission is, fighting over vacant reserved parking spaces, a new hire's initial experiences - all were described in too many words, with little humor, and to no purpose.Save your money and your reading moments for something (anything) else."
2,Don't bother,"This book is a disappointment. I took a free Kaplan test through my school,and it was the same one in the book. Most of the stuff is pretty explanatory, and you can learn more by getting a general LSAT book (I prefer Princeton Review to Kaplan). You don't get much out of only two tests. I would get the Princeton Review LSAT book and then buy real tests from LSDAS and try to find out why I got them wrong on my own. But believe them when they tell you the LSAT is important. It really opened doors for me."
4,A mother's Vision of her girls,"Carol Mavor takes interesting and provocative photographs from Queen Victoria's era, and turns them into an intellectual tour de force. She dissects Hawarden's motivations and her work comparing it to her modern peer, Sally Mann. As an ardent and avid photographer of interesting women I think that Carol Mavor looks beyond the two dimensions of a photograph to see the soul of the subject...Hawarden was clearly not a woman of her time and class, but an artist beyond time. I am fascinated how well smart women can see beyond the superficial to the suprising, how emotion and sensuality is exposed through Victorian garments, or Virginia countryside naturalism. This book made me want to meet Carol Mavor, and you, the reader will be facinated by what she has to say as much as the photos say for themselves."
4,america's 25 best praise & worship songs,"I'm glad I purchased this album, I think that if you like Hosanna Music this would be a great addition to or a good beginner album for your collection."
3,Good,The book is good. But if you can solve all the problems (buy the solutions manual) then you will be able to extract all the value from it.
4,Very Good Masters level text,"Every professor at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business uses this text for the beginning level finance course - Investments. I found the book to be very readable, with excellent examples. It does a good job explaining the pros and cons of various financial models - Portfolio Theory, CAPM, Multi-Factor Asset Pricing, No Arbitrage Bond Pricing, Black-Scholes, etc. You cannot go wrong with the content in this book."
1,Worst textbook I ever used,Overly comprehensive. Stifling. This book gets lost in the trees without ever telling you where the forest is. This is the most dense textbook I've encountered and its treatment of jurisdictional differences should be left to independent study. Post-law school knowledge would suffice for the practitioner; simply providing a majority and minority position (where applicable of course) would do more for the student's understanding of adjudicatory criminal procedure.
5,Me encanto,Es mucho mejor de lo que esperaba. Lo pedi en nombre de mi padre que cada año cuando transmitian ese concierto por television lo veia hasta el final con lagrimas en los ojos por la emocion que le causaba y yo creia que era solo por ser un viejo. Pues me paso lo mismo y ya lo vi cinco veces!
4,Can't go wrong with Vienna Ph. New Year's Concert.,"I've been watching every single one of the Vienna Philharmonic,'s New Year's Concerts since I was a kid, and always enjoyed them. I have mixed feelings about this one: the conductor decided to step out of tradition a bit and introduced too many medleys of popular pieces from the Strauss family. I'm not a big fan of that, I like to listen to one piece from start to end. Also, the disk does not have a option for viewing the concert with the corresponding ballet sequences, you have to go to the main menu and watch the latter separately. Overall, it's still an entertaining hour of music, but I miss the excitement that old-time conductors used to bring to this concert."
5,When I woke up today my neck did not hurt,I've had extensive spinal surgery and when I wake up my neck & back always hurt. I received my pillow from Amazon two days ago. After using this pillow for 2 nights I am able to get up in the morning without pain. I am also getting more sleep. If you have a neck and back made of titanium this is the pillow for you. If you always have a stiff neck this pillow is for you.
5,"Great Condition, Comprehensive Text","This 2 volume text came to me in great condition. You cant beat the price- If you are debating between the 9th and 8th edition, go for the 8th and save about $300. Besides, the DSM-V will be out soon rendering both editions ""obsolete"" as far as following DSM structure. Sure the 8th edition is missing a few of the newer pharmacological agents; but, again, save some money. Great text.... maybe too much information. Invaluable reference."
4,Good book but needs organization,"The theme of this book that Western Civilization is abandoning reason really resonated for me. However, I think it would of worked better as a loose collection of essays instead of trying to hammer everything into one main thesis.The main thesis as stated, that 1979 with the Iran revolution and the election of Marget Thatcher, is never really supported. Many of the chapters have nothing to do with 1979 being the turning point.My favorite part was the last quarter of the book, in which Mr. Wheen attacks the left defending the terrorist attacks as something that America ""deserved"". He draws great comparisions with the lefts defence of Stalinist russa. As someone who tends to be liberal on many issues, I also find that the left wing trying to justify, and in ways supporting, terrorist actions completely unacceptable."
4,Great little loupe!,"These are great optically. I use one all the time. I lost one when it fell apart and just had the screws fall out of another, but found the pieces and put it back together. The answer is simple, buy this loupe, and as soon as you get it, find a little screwdriver, take the screws out, and replace them with some nail polish or, what the heck, epoxy to prevent them from loosening. (Of course commercial thread locker would be better yet (maybe)). Still the best loupe you can buy for the money, I just ordered another to have a spare, but I give 4 stars because they fall apart unless you work them over."
4,Belomo 10 x triplet Loupe,Very satisfied with the product as it meets all of my requirements. The Belomo 10 x Triplet Loupe purchased via Amazon was good value for money. The only downside was the over inflated delivery cost that actually doubled the price of the Loupe.
2,Nice Church...Shame About The Movie!,"Very slow movie that never really went anywhere. It was interesting to see the lack of continuity as well. One minute there are cars from the 1950's on the road, and the next minute there is a PC on the desk.The scenery surrounding the church, and the church itself was beautiful!"
4,Nice and warm in the office,"I work in a casual environment, but some like it cold and some like it hot. Sometimes the AC is a little too...refreshing. When I'm freezing, I can pull this on and feel about right. It has lasted through many washings, and looks the same as when it was new, which is to say it looks old; cool in a grungy sort of way. I bought it because I liked the color-I wish my car was this color.4 stars - slightly too grungy for my office, but if that isn't a consideration for you (maybe you work in Seattle or Anchorage), buy it. It lasts, and orange is the best color in the world.P.S. If you get a grease spot on it, throw it in with the dry cleaning. It comes back bright and grungy as new!"
3,Disappointed,I was kinda expecting a little more than the average half hour episode. It was like just watching another show except it had a little Christmas in it. At least there are two shows instead of one. And i would have liked to have found it on DVD too. All in all it was just as entertaining as any of the other episodes.
2,Not as good a deal as I thought.,"I thought the 100pc 6"" white Ball Bungee Cords were a great deal. I got a lot of cords for what I paid, but they have broken so fast and had to be replaced so often already that I think I would have been better off buying a more expensive, higher quality pack."
5,Work Great,These bungees were exactly what we needed. They got sent to us very quickly. I have absolutely no complaints about them.
1,The worst instrumental guitar album in history?,"Lonero's promo sheets would have you believe he's the second coming of Satch. Far from it. He's a third-rate player with a Satch obsession. His melodies are repetitive and derivative, his song structures are simplistic, and his playing is incredibly subpar, with clams here and there and a chancy rhythmic placement.Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere, even on Satriani's later production, even though it is no match for his own output from the late 80s-early 90s. Lonero's album is simply terrible."
1,Too bad it wasn't better....,I'm always intrigued by Steve Berry's book titles; too bad he isn't a better writer....
1,"Bad history, bad writing","In Steve Berry's world black is white and white is black. The so called historical background is laughable, as is the entire premise. All of this might have worked as pure entertainment, as in the Di vincci Code, but Berry is just not a good writer. I feel sorry for any reader that is not informed about archaeology in the Middle East or history in general. Such a poor soul might even believe this nonsense. Too bad."
2,the Hardy Boys go east,"Yet another one of those ""the Church is keeping stuff from us"" books, jumping on the ""Da Vinci Code"" (another mess) bandwagon. Full of bad theology and bad history. About the only thing I can say is that it's a fun read, but better as an audio book while you're driving or traveling. Not something you'd want to waste any serious leisure-time reading on."
1,Ugh,"I wish I had read the reviews here... I thought ""The Templar Legacy"" was a solid effort, so I bought this one. Big mistake. I won't rehash the other negative reviews, which I really wish I had bothered to read before wasting money on this thing. Never again for Steve Berry."
1,True to history or not - it's BORING!!,"Sorry, Berry, but the plot is idiotic, the research shallow, the characters two-dimensional and the writing void of literary qualities. The book brought back disturbing memories of my childhood's Hardy boys books, just like the truly silly stories from Dan Browns pen. Here we have ""The Hardy boys and the lost library"". Still, The Alexandria Link has one thing that these books lack - repetitions - endless repetitions. It feeds us the ""scary"" plot of the tampering with the original biblical texts, again and again. Who cares?! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
2,Not his best,"Having read most of Berry's books, I was eager to read this one. It had an interesting sounding plotline about a topic that has not been the subject of that many fiction books - the Library at Alexandria.Sadly, it took me over 4 months to finish the books. A good initial burst of excitement and writing bogged down by about page 100, and from there on it went downhill. Characters were never really developed, the plot was very convoluted and the ending seemed way to simplistic.Luckily I was able to finish a few other books while working on this one. I think it is time of the author, whom I usually like, to take a bit of a break and come back with a much stronger effort next time. If not, it will be my last time reading his novels."
1,Mystery Buff,This is my second Steve Berry novel. The first was Templar Legacy which Ifelt was mediocre...Alexandria Link is positively dreadful!
5,Enjoyable Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. I'm a History Major at Arizona State University and the book hit home with me with all the possible ""what if's"". Books were not kept real well in the past and that also includes the Bible, I was born and raised in a Lutheran home and also went to a Lutheran parochial school and I always questioned if things were accurately accounted for in the Bible and this just book just fuels my reasoning even more. It's not a anti-sementic book like another reviewer called, it doesn't practice any witchcraft or devil practices, it just makes you think if the Bible was re-worded or tells a different story to ""sugar coat"" what really happened. Love it....can't wait to read the rest of Steve berry's books!"
3,The Alexandria Link,"Okay book, but could have been a couple hundred pages shorter. The plot was really drawen out; yet, there was not much detail given to library which the whole book revolved around finding."
2,"Good story, Bad history.","In just the first few pages it became clear that Steve Berry either is intentionally distorting history or doesn't know his facts. In either case, this is inexcusable. Why Berry would choose to use the historical context of this book as a tract to spew outright fallacious propaganda is really a question only the author could answer. The story itself was quite interesting but I couldn't finish the book due to the distracting and misleading historical context.For those of you who either don't know accurate Middle East history or don't care, you have a story here you will enjoy. For those who do know history as it really happened and care, you will be too distracted to enjoy this book."
2,Guns a Blazin',"As a thriller, this book does move at a good pace and everything in it is pretty much predictable. I like the premise about the Library at Alexandria. BUT, everyone in the novel is always shooting at everyone else in the novel. Lots of bodies lying everywhere. No surprises because the reader expects guns to start blazing at every turn. And they do. That was laughable."
5,Non-stop Thriller,"His best yet! Steve Berry has gone up yet another notch with The Alexandria Link, combining fast-paced action with a cornucopia of arcane knowledge spanning Europe to the Middle East.Reprising Cotton Malone, a retired operative from the U.S. State Department, who is the sole person who knows the key to perhaps finding the lost Library of Alexandria, Berry sends Cotton off to rescue his son when Cotton's ex-wife, Pam, shows up at his rare bookshop in Copenhagen with the tale of his kidnapping.Cotton, reluctantly saddled with Pam, sets out on the rescue and steps into a world of international intrigue as very powerful people try to pry the secret link from him. The prize is proof of lost knowledge of ancient history that could change the world, and the people who seek it are very powerful, and also very dangerous, indeed.The Alexandria Link is a great yarn and a lot of fun to read."
5,Well researched,"Steve Berry is one of those writers who gets better with each book. ""The Alexandria Link"" is well written, well researched and the best historically based novel I have read in quite a while. A chock full read that keeps the reader entertained all the way to the end. A must read for any Berry fans, or a good place to be introduced to him and his talent."
1,Boring and bad history,"Save your self the price of this book and more importantly, your time. The book drags, the characters are wooden, and the ""factual"" history (which I normally enjoy in this genre of books), is riddled with errors that will be obvious to anyone even slightly familiar with the local history. A poor Da Vinci code imitator."
4,Full of twists and Turn,"What ifs of history are always fun. And Berry has added several news twists to that question. What if the Library of Alexandria had survived. Read the book and find out. He is great at keeping my attention and just when I thought I knew who the villian was, he threw in another layer and left me hanging on for another chapter."
4,Big FUN!!!,"I give this a 4 star rating not because Bette Davis could sing, but because she had the unmitigated nerve to actually do this. Despite the fact that her voice is way less than melodic, it has character and I love it!! Letter to Daddy is my favorite, but ""Can't Be Wrong"" is also very good, that is as much as good can relate to Bette Davis as chanteuse."
3,"MADE in CHINA, OK product","It was not well packed same way you see in the picture so it scratches other items in the same box when I received it. Amazon should put it in a small plastic bag before shipping instead. If you have a squid internal shell (Cuttlebone), it cleans your toilets and sinks better than this one. I think that they may copy the structure of squid internal shell. But, I prefer to use squid internal shell for cleaning since it is safer and more natural way (squid internal shells can be collected from the beach)"
5,A wonderful product,I love this product a lot. It helped me to remove hard water stain from my toilets and sinks. I also bought a pumie with a handle to compare with. This one is slightly thinner and easier to control. But I love both a lot. A must have for your bathroom.
2,"Soft Pumice stick, definitely not Heavy Duty","Bought 3 of this pumice sticks thought it should do the job (clean my pool whole perimeter's white deposit line once) and have some left over. Oh boy I was completely off the mark. Not only didn't even finish cleaning my pool's calcium deposit line for one complete round, all three were finished by only went through 3/4 round and not all clean still. Worked like a piece hard mash mellow on super hard surface(pool tiles). Not working well at all."
5,"Great product, superb customer service",A solid yet softly textured garment. The company handled a size exchange very quickly. I recommend this item and this company.
2,New Jill Swing,"Joyce Tolbert, Demonica Santiago, and shireen Crutchfield returned with their sophmore CD in 1992. Having listened to this CD two things immediatley spring to mind. As one reviewer has mentioned, the material at their disposal is very patchy/uneven. From the splendid 'Just call me' (I prefer the remix version) the excellent' Since I fell for you'(which is my favorite song on the CD)and the mid tempo'Running from Love, show, when they are given the right material to suit their vocals, they shine. Alas some of the other material, as well as being weak, also highlights the fact that their vocals weren't the strongest that have been heard. I'm coming back, 'Loves in Loves hand' are examples of this. Any New Jack swinger should pick this up for 'Just call me, and 'Since I fell for you'. Thanks to retro_styled crooner, through his Listmania, for bringing this CD to my attention."
3,"Not as good as their 1989 album, but really not that bad","With the all-around winning formula of their 1989 debut album, it briefly seemed as though the Good Girls would be the Supremes for the 90s. On this second album, however, a lot of what made ""All For Your Love"" such a winning album seems to be missing. The formula isn't all that much different, but here the girls just don't sound like they're having as much fun. However, the dreamy slow jam ""It Must Be Love"" is wonderful, and even though it probably carries the rest of the album on it's shoulders, just being able to have this song makes the album worth tracking down."
3,Not as much pictures as i like,There are a lot of good receipes... The one thing that turned me off when i recieved it is that there are not pictures for every receipe. Might not be important to all people but very important to me. If you are like me and need lots of pictures.. probably not the book for you. But there are lots of healthy fast meals.
3,"""Serenade continues the legacy....""","To all of the Serenade compilation lovers out there,This latest installment in the Serenade series showcases some good talents, especially when they brung back some of the artists from Volume 1. Some of the highlight songs from this series were performed by Forte, IF, Jocelyn Enriquez, Serenade and Touch. Even efforts by new and upcoming artists Lyrik and Bigg Saint were on point. I gave it 3 stars out of five, but it's still something to bump to in your rides or in the bedrooms. A must-have for any and all romantics out there."
2,Encyclopedia membership ends Oct 2006,"The encyclopedia membership for Encarta ends on Oct. 2006, so don't bother buying this if you plan to use it for a later school year. Also, keep in mind that this is a subscription software that will need to be renewed each year. On Microsoft's web site, the monthly membership price is $4.95 per month, the cost of the software includes the membership. But it is not based on when you buy the software. It is based on the academic school year."
4,Microsoft Student 2006,"A great program. I'm working on a BS and MS in Criminal Justice. The program is for high school studnets, but I'm finding that I can use Encarta and other parts of the program.I can use. Mircosoft should make a Student 2006 for college students or make teh current program designed for both high school and college students."
4,Decent,"this is a decent item, hold the product pretty well but the way it is attached to the tub wall with suction cups doesn't make it as sturdy as i hoped, but it hasn't fallen. my son tries to get the product out but still hasn't been able to attempt it unless i hold the container."
1,Carmen Pole,"dont recomend to anyone its very UNSAFE you can only spin clockwise otherwise gets loose and falls, when u spin"
2,Turkey Dry!,"Almost a second after mentioning his date of birth, the narrator states when Klee got married. At three and a half minutes, the date of his death comes up. One never gets to see a photo of the artist (cameras did exist at that time). So this was almost entirely about his work.They stress his musical background. I think his work was meant to create a type of synesthesia. They mention so much painting that he did in the 1910s, but World War I never comes up. Maybe he was a purposely apolitical artist. Eventually, the narrator mentions Picasso and cubism, but schools and fellow artists hardly come up.If you like dry, but deep, art lectures, then this is for you."
4,Not a documentary but great viewing,"This is a great film and I recommend it for all looking to know more about Paul Klee. However, the narrator's voice is not very inspiring and, though one grows used to it, could have been much better. Also, he pronounces ""Kleeee"" instead of ""Clay"", which is confusing. The documentary aspect is sort of lame - there's no real talk of the era, only some mention of contemporaries, and he's died within the first ten minutes. However, the film gives you lots and lots of Klee's art, close up and beautiful. You get lots of titles and dates and plenty of close up art. There is even a bit of art historian style interpretation of the art, its execution, drawing attention to some details, styles, and only a wee little bit about the man. But just to sit there and look at art, with thumb hovering near the pause button is delightfully rich and rewarding, and I recommend it with this approach."
2,Disappointing,"I love the series, and only caught up to this British film after seeing all the available TV shows on video. The casting was fine, though the series actors are much better. My problem with this film are these: It is almost word for word from the first two episodes of the Series. Also...I don't think it was such a hot idea to make a film, as it only added up to a few stories told episodically. There was no single story line to sustain a film. It ends with James and Helen getting married and James seeing his nameplate on the door.Hopkins was a very capable Farnon, though, Hardy is better. And Simon Ward was adequate. I love the books and Series, but I may sell this video at auction."
5,Great historical angle,In this time the financial delusions are very uo to date! This is one of the best classic historian since 17th century
1,If it seems like too good a deal...,"This item is *A* rollerball ink refill. Notwithstanding the title header of ""6 Count,"" if you look at the ""Product description,"" you'll notice the slightly obscure blurb ""Sold as 1 EA."" Maybe they broke open a six-count pack, but it's shipped as one per order. Consequently, when you factor in shipping costs, this goes from being an excellent price to being a horrible one.On the bright side, their shipping time is fantastic; I ordered the thing on Wednesday night and received it Friday."
5,Great Compilation,Great compilation. Consists of many songs that you won't find on every other compilation.
3,Relative to Henri Vaillancourt?,I have seen the book and read most of it and think of it as a treasure for craftsmanship. I am also interested in it for the genealogical importance. I hope to find out if Henri is a relation or not.
5,ONE OF THE BEST!!!!,"This was one of the best romance novels that I've read. I really like Masqurade by Brenda Joyce and thought I would never find one that equals that, but I think I have in this one. The heroine was so strong and wouldn't give up on her man..I wish that BJ would write one about the brother, James. It would be interesting to find out what happened to him..."
4,Brenda Joyce is Terrific,I have never read a Brenda Joyce novel that I did not immediately become totally involved in. She paints her characters vividly. The problem is I read them faster than she writes them.
3,"Strong male characters, weaker female character","Brenda Joyce has always been one of my favorite romance writers. She creates one of the most sensual and memorable love scenes but more toward the second half of this book. Ms. Joyce gives you a diverse setting than some of the historical romances that she has written. Ms. Joyce usually writes well- paced books. And in this book, she gives you strong male character development ... more than the main female character. Not my favorite of her books, but still an enjoyable book altogether."
2,It must be just me,I don't like it. I have to try & try to get it to work. I really have to push down hard on it to get it to work. maybe I'm too weak
4,Great for stretching and relaxing,"I did a lot of muscle conditioning and pilates workouts prior to getting pregnant, but never actually did yoga. The first time was a bit confusing (have you ever tried to look at a TV screen while in ""downward facing dog""?!). Anyway, while not a strenous ""workout"" it is a wonderful and relaxing stretch video. I have used it many nights just to unwind and stretch my legs after work. It has also helped a bit with the calf cramps that are so prevelant in pregnancy. I am now in my third trimester, and still love doing this tape at night to help all my muscles stretch and relax. Again, NOT a strenous workout, but good for stretching, and easy to pick up as a novice."
3,good but too fast-paced,"I have done yoga in the past, but needed a tape specifically for pregnancy. The video was great for that, but it was otherwise too fast-paced. No pose was held for very long before we were on to the next one. I still use the video, but it is not among my favorites."
3,Too slow - instructor talks too much,"I ususally only have 15-20 minutes of time to work out per day. If I put this video on for 15 minutes, I don't get much of a workout because the instructor spends so much time talking. I don't really feel much better after this workout. I like Shiva Rea's (sp?) Pre-Natal workout much better."
3,Easy yoga but not for experienced mama's,I was a workout freak before I was pregnant. I would work out about 4-8 hours a day. Well you can guesse that when I got pregnant I also got tired and cut way back on my workouts.I have been doing yoga for about 8 years and there are very few pregnancy videos on the market. I have a few crunch tapes which I enjoy and so I thought I would give this a shot.This is a very EASY tape. If youve never done yoga you'll catch on and enjoy it. However I feel that it was much too easy and too light for someone who has been doing it for a while.I did this tape 5 days a week throughout my pregnancy and I never really got a good stretch from it. Maybe thats how pregnancy is but I hope to find something better next time around.
3,relaxing but not exercise,"This is great to use at any stage of pregnancy, even when you are feeling HUGE and your legs are swollen. It's too easy to be considered exercise, but for stretching and helping with the uncomfortable side effects of pregnancy, it's great. If you do view it regularily, the narration becomes a bit repetitive...especially when the instructor talks about talking to your baby, etc. But I alwasy felt better after doing the routine!"
2,"Not a ""workout"" dvd","I am disappointed by this prenatal dvd. I am a late beginner/early intermediate yogi and find the routine boring and not at all challenging. The poses are not held long enough to be effective. Agreeing with other reviewers, the instructor talks too much and tends to be cheesy. She is also not consistent in the breath reminders...leaving you wondering if you should be inhaling or exhaling. I really don't know how anyone with a reasonable amount of fitness could find this dvd worth a second view."
3,"Too much talking, not enough stretching","This video is ok, but too often I found myself sitting in cross-legged position while the instrutor talked - instead of losing myself in a good stretch. If you are new to yoga, this tape is probably great for you. If you are not new to yoga, I would highly recommend the Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea from Living Arts instead. There are a variety of poses, including standing and floor work. I have had a lot of back pain with this pregnancy, and doing the Prenatal Yoga video every morning has been a life saver!"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"It's great, it makes you really work out! I'm not a yoga person, but this does it for me! BUY IT!"
3,a bit slow going,"It took almost two weeks to receive this video. I thought it would be great, stretch, quite my mind, deep breathing, but it is so slow. The instructor is really talkative It seems to waste a lot of time talking and not so much time in the poses and focusing on quite breathing throughout the stretches. The video is really long, and I dont have a lot of time so I've only used it a couple of times."
3,Good,It was okay but I thought the positions weren't held for long. I like when the instructor gives detailed information and that wasn't the case.
2,Didn't work with my Traynor,"So I opened it, installed a TRS jack, wired it accordingly to my amp needs and got it to work."
5,Window to the Authors Soul,After visiting St. Simons Island for the past five summers I am hooked. After reading this book I am in the process of reading all the St. Simons books I can find by Eugenia Price. She has made my trips come to life. She talks about places I have visited and I now have a better understanding of how she felt. This book really gets into her soul and I saw a very spiritual person who enjoyed her life. Now when I go I will have a better knowledge of the island. Anyone who gets the chance should read her books and plan a trip to her island. This place has captured my heart and soul and I feel as if it is where I belong. I think this is how Ms. price must have felt. The island has a calming effect and keeps calling one back for more.
5,Great Helmet for a great kid,"Today was our first father/son bike commute and the little guy's first chance to wear this helmet out of the house. It took him a couple minutes to get used to the extra weight on his head, but then he was loving the bike ride.Importantly, not only does this helmet protect his head, it also covers his ears to keep them warm so we don't have to figure out how to get a hat under it. That was pretty important today. The straps and pads also seemed pretty comfortable."
4,Greatest American Hero,"The Greatest American Hero box set is great for any collector that is a fan of the show. Although the decal was very small, the cape and instruction manual are GREAT. I personally think the GREATEST AMERICAN HERO is the best thought up most creative superhero of all time. THANKS"
5,One of my all time favorites Still,"I bought the complete 2006 set. I even got it autographed By William Katt. It brought back soooo many memories. These sets were numbered and limited to 20,000. I tried on the cape. It went down to my calves. It was awesome!! The book only had a few pages, but that's all anyone really saw. Season 3 was out of order, but the release dates are written on the guide it comes with.The only issue I had was that his name was changed to Mr. Hanley, due to John Hinkley's attempt on Reagan.The music was changed for the release. As far as I am concerned, as long as the theme song is unchanged, its all good.If you were as big a fan as I was and am, it is a welcomed addition to any collection."
2,Don't Order This Refill.,The cost for shipping was more expensive than the refill. It could have been placed in a regular envelope. Go to Staples and buy one. Waste of money ordering such a small item through Amazon.
5,sheerly beautiful,"I have listened to some other more famous works by Milhaud, but this chamber music album is one of my favorite. None of the pieces in this collection is large, but they are all very expressive and abundant in emotion. Milhaud sounds avant-garde even in our time, but there is some kind of charming harmony in his music. I think his music is much easier to appreciate than those atonal works. It will take you a while to appreciate his creativity if your ears are used to music of baroque era and classical era, but it is going to be rewarding.As for recording, compared to other old recordings of Milhaud's works, some actually conducted by the composer himself, this new recording is very clear and enjoyable. If you like Milhaud's music, you should not miss this album."
3,Good CD,"I first heard Cormega on Violator 1 and I was like wow this guy is nice. Well his Cd didn't let me down. I appreciate his realness, because it is lacking in rap these days."
5,A classic cd hands down,This is one of the best rap cd's I've ever heard and after hearing this I have a lot of respect for cormega and I think he's a lot better than nas because his rhymes are deeper and more thought provoking and I don't know what the source is talking about giving him a 3.5 mics I think it's a definate 5 and they should review it with people who know what real rap is. Overall everything about this album is flawless and every rap fan should buy this.
2,A disappointing release of the early '80s gigs,"This could have been a lot better. It misses one the most typical things of a td gig - Edgar's guitar solo. Bondy Parade featured in their '81 tour of the UK and Edgar's guitar line, and the accompanying bass line, made it outstanding. On Sohoman, the track is twinkly and lightweight, as with the other tracks. Sohoman is also only 45 mins long - the remaining 20 mins or so could have been used for previously unreleased stuff only available on poor quality bootlegs."
2,Sorryman,"Incomplete recording of the Sydney concert, for some reason the prices on the used section are still outrageously steep. Yes this is the awesome trio of TD 80's with Schmoeling and Franke the music is really vintage TD but this cd release was short, incomplete, poor sound mastering it's like listening to the concert then suddenly the whole concert was aborted leaving you with a few tracks. The Bootmoon 2 cd is the genuine representation of this live show it was actually a radio broadcast recording with commentary. This 2 cd makes Sohoman obsolete! Buy only at $5 or less, I got mine at 20 so it was really a total loss I was very stubborn, persistent and if only I have listened to the negative reviews...."
2,GOOD BEGINNER WORKOUT,"THIS IS A VERY EASY TAPE TO FOLLOW THAT IS NOT CHALLENGING TO THE BODY. I HAVE HAD THE TAPE FOR OVER A YEAR AND FIND MYSELF VERY BORED WITH IT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT CHALLENGING. FROM THE GET GO, I HAVE USED 5-10LBS MORE WEIGHT THAN INSTUCTOR FOR EACH EXERCISE AND STILL DO NOT FEEL LIKE I AM GETTING A WORK OUT. I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR SOMEONE JUST STARTING OUT OR SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT DONE MUCH WEIGHT TRAINING BEFORE."
3,Childrens book,"the illustrations are interesting and yes it is interesting information however, there is not real story which would make it a lot more interesting. It might be a helpful instructional material in a school but I would not categorize it as an interesting, captivating book to be read by or to a child. The book struck me as very boring not very memorable. I am soo tired of all the fairly mediocre childrens books out there...."
3,Disappointed...,"At first I gave this flag a 5 star review. However, I had not looked closely enough at it until we actually hung the flag. As we did, we realized that all of the stars were embroidered except one. One of the stars was partially embroidered but on one of the corners they just cut a piece of felt and sewed it on.I'm starting to wonder it it really is American-made."
5,God Bless America,"What can I say it flys like any other flag but here is what your looking for its not made in some forgin country its made in America. I love it. What a concept, make it here buy it here."
3,Not for high winds,The flag only lasted 3 weeks--I admit--we live in a windy place but I had hope it would do better outside.
1,Old Glory Not Flying High,Bought this American flag as a Christmas gift for a family member. Flag was flown for the first time the week of 2/28/11 from a standard flag pole & didn't last a week. The grommets pulled out & the stitching on a number of the stars began to come apart. Would not recommend this product. Can't even return it at this point...you get what you pay for holds true in this case.
5,"Excellent flag for the price, sturdy construction","This flag arrived today, I am giving it as a gift to a friend who keeps a permanently lit flagpole. The construction feels sturdy, the nylon fabric has a nice thick weight. The stitching uses strong threading, with double stitching around the edges and the grommets are nice and big. The stars are completely embroidered and they stand out from the surface of the flag, they feel nice. I would definitely recommend this flag and will surely purchase it again in the future."
1,Shreded,"Ordered this through BC Novelties. Not sure if they sent a genuine Annin Nyl-Glo flag or not. It came in generic packaging. I have had this up for less than 4 months now and is starting to shred. Granted, we've had some crazy storms this year... but it should've held up to it. The color still looks good, but the ends are starting to unravel. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll have to replace it soon."
1,outdoor flag,I purchased this flag because of their recommended stitching. In less than one week outdoors the stitching on the outer end of the flag had failed. In less than one month the atitching on the stripes was failing. I would not recommend flag for 24 hour outdoor.
2,Not made in America,"The only reason it got two stars instead of one was that the shipping was great. The first thing I noticed about this flag was that the tag says ""MADE IN PAKISTAN."" It is false advertising to say that is American made. The flag was stained on one of the white stripes. Mine is hanging on a wall and the flag does not hang straight. It is not even close to a perfect rectangle. I do not recommend this product."
3,Good except for the background,"This is a good step video. Kendall Hogan is very energetic and the music is great. His ""class"" is made up of very buxom women with six-pack stomachs that make an effort to out shake each other and try to look provocative. I'm not a prude; it just gets annoying after 5 minutes. Had I know they were there I would not have bought it. I prefer exercise tapes with real people working out. Of course now it may sell well for those who like to watch that sort of thing."
4,Interesting Read...I loved it!,"I read this about 3 years ago, when I was only 13 years old. Even then, I understood and enjoyed this book. How the characters lives change over the years was very interesting to read. I love reading books about other cultures and I found this book to be an enriching reading experience, and am looking forward to reading other books by this author."
3,Interesting but not very involving,"Night of Many Dreams has a very interesting plot and very interesting characters. However, the writing style was too superficial. You were not emotionally involved with the characters because Tsukiyama never really reveals the inner feelings of those characters. As I read the novel, I felt as if I were watching the characters from afar, rather than viewing the world around them from their eyes. I also didn't get the real sense of the surroundings when I read Tsukiyama's descriptions. As I said earlier, the plot was interesting, but the novel was not engaging."
5,Love it!,I bought this for my husband and he loves it! It took a little longer than I hoped for but he does live in Alaska so I did expect a bit of delay.
5,Yay!!!,"I love Fruits Basket, I'm obsessed, my computer is decorated for it... I'm thinking of being Honda-san for halloween. She's just so innocent, and then Yuki and Kyo-kyo, so adorable. That in itself would be sweet, but throw in the comedic relif of our dear Shii-chan, Aya, and their keeper, Ha'ri... It's perfect. I started out addicted to the show, but the mangas are even better than the show, by far. (which I thought would be impossible... Shii-chan's voice *faints*...).Anyway, FB is awesome, and the only excuse for not buying it is that you already have it!!! ^_~"
3,Good general information,I found the book basic but lots of idea's and general information. A good place to start and worth a look if your a beginner.
4,GREAT SELECTION OF EPISODES,I really enjoyed this collection. I only wish someone would do the whole series on DVD.
2,Probe doesn't work anymore,"I have tried this on many applications. It worked fair. Lately, I plug the probe in and immediately tells me it reached the temperature, which we all know is not true. Disappointing. Probe looks like it is brand new, but no longer works."
3,"Horrible Movie,Great Extra",Please only buy this if you are a Bruce Campbell fan. Why? A Great 5-Star Commentary to a 1-Star Movie.
5,Did I want to laugh my but off? No but I have to when I watch this DVD!,"It's a exercise DVD realy. 5 Second abbs. ""It's that funny"" This movie is one of the only comedians I understand and I have true laughter because of it. Im just waiting for someone to beat me up for this dvd. I havn't watched the shows with Eddie Murphy but I do know that there are now white people jokes. This is defanatly part of my collection since there is no drama or violence. Thanks again."
5,Great Swan: Meetings with Ramakrishna,"The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I'm still on page 53 of 307, but I could tell right away it is a consciousness-rising book. Enjoying it very much, and taking many notes as I go along. Clearly Ramakrishna lived in a culture vasty different from ours in the current time, but there is so much to be learned and apply even in today's environment; it speaks to our souls."
2,Falls off the cage,This hay feeder continued to fall off the cage. We had a similar one (different mfr) and it worked like a charm.
4,"Seems Okay, Easier to Fill than the Roller Ball","We started out with the ball hay holder but it is a real pain to fill. So we switched to this. It is really easy to fill, just drop the hay in. No problems so far and the guinea pigs get the hay out.I don't like that there are hooks on both sides so that even if you hook it on the cage, there are still hooks on the exposed side. I'm not sure why they did that since the holder is the same front to back. Unless they wanted flexibility for which side the salt lick goes on.I'm a little concerned about what some other reviewers have written about pigs getting their heads stuck but I think ours are big enough that it wouldn't happen."
3,"Not the greatest, but it will do!","This wouldn't stay on the side of the cage without tying it onto the cage. The pigs knocked it off the first day of use. So, if you tie it on, it's a good hay feeder."
4,Sunforce solar vent,"Got what I ordered, it looks good, easy to install, works fine. How long it will last is an open question."
4,solar fans,product seems good although instructions were a bit ambiguous and not yet certain that it does all we hoped.
3,student needs answer key,"This is an easy and relatively painless way for a struggling student to cover geometry concepts without getting into theorem proofs. Our daughter feels a sense of accomplishment as she easily completed the first three books. However, the exercises alone are useless unless the tutor knows the correct answers him/herself or has an answer key. We are using these books this summer as a precursor to our high school's regular geometry course which will be taken this Fall so that our daughter will not struggle so much during the academic school year. I also believe that it is good to keep skills honed over the summer. So far, I remember my Geometry from 45 years ago to help her. I do think it it will be well worth it to purchase the answer keys, at least for the last four books of the series, and strongly recommend that to anybody who is not math oriented."
3,ok hygrometer,Got 3 of these and they all say that it was pre-celebrated but when I did the salt test 2 of them show the same results and 1 show a lot lower %. With the salt test it is suppose to give a 75% humility on the hygrometer which none of them gave. I even left it over night but still could not get 75%. I did match it up to one of the analog meters and it was pretty close. About 1 -2 % difference.
1,Pissed Off,"I received the meter, and removed the plastic battery protector. Low and behold it didn't work no display. I checked the battery, and it checked fine. So the only thing that came in the box worth a crap was the battery."
4,How to adjust your Hygrometer,"I bought this for my humidor, and it's a good compromise between cost, accuracy and size. I have no complaints about any of the three.Here's how to adjust a hygrometer:Fill a small container with salt. Add a small amount of water until the salt is wet, but not soaked (if you poured out the container you wouldn't have any water run out). Put the container in a ziplock baggie with the meter and let it sit overnight. In the morning, the meter should read 75%. (Cool, huh?) If it doesn't read 75%, adjust the meter: For example, if it reads 80% adjust the reading down by 5% and repeat if necessary. Instructions on how to adjust come with the meter."
2,At Least The Thermometer Worked...,"Maybe this was was a defective unit but trying to calibrate the hygrometer was just that - trying. One click of the adjustment knob would yield anywhere from a 4-8 degrees variation. Maybe I'm being picky but using the salt method the closest I got was 73 degrees. Compared with 2 other digital thermometers, though the temperature was dead on."
1,Does not adjust.,"Tried adjusting this using hygrometer using the specially purchased 75% humidity packet. After 24-36 hours the unit read 8% lower, 67% instead of 75%. I attempted to turn the adjust knob with my fingers without success, so I used a pair of pliers. Since you don't know exactly what's going after the adjustment, I placed the unit in the humidity packet again. You need to wait another 24-36 hours before checking the humidity.This time the humidity read 85%, 10% higher. I attempted to adjust the humidity down without success over a period of a week, alternately adjusting the unit then placing it in the humidity packet. Sent the humidity pack and hygrometer back. What a waste of time and money!"
2,"this might have been the greatest generation, but it certainly wasnt because of this tripe","an attempt at an american ""mrs miniver"", and 60+ years later it falls just as flat. the usually vibrant claudette colbert gives one of her stiffest performances, with insufficient support from a list of otherwise usually reliable castmates, e.g. joseph cotten, jennifer jones, hattie mcdaniel, &c. the one solid performance is from agnes moorehead as the town biddy, and theres a major curiosity performance by a teenaged shirley temple, long past her age of appeal. perhaps this bucked up people on the homefront during ww2, but it does little to inform &/or entertain today."
2,A Boring Film,"This film reminds me of ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" which has withstood the test of time. It's one of the great films, but this imitation isn't. Shirley Temple deserved better. Why did I watch it from beginning to end? Because I hoped that Shirley Temple would eventually get what she deserved, a chance to be an adult actress. Never happened. Also, the rest of the cast is so outstanding, I simply got curious. How could this film be so mediocre? I guess imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but movies are better if they're fresh, original."
5,A MOVIE STILL TRUE TODAY,"PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FOR MY WIFE THAT SHE HAS SEEN SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS, BEGINNING WITH THE OLD ""MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE"". HAVE SEEN QUITE A BIT OF THIS BUT NEVER SAT TO WATCH IT IN ONE SITTING. IT'S REALLY MY WIFE THAT REQUESTED IT. CONSIDERING THE WAR OF TODAY, WITH THIS TAKING PLACE ON THE HOMEFRONT IN WWII, THE IMPACT ON THE FAMILIES OF THOSE SERVING STILL HOLDS TRUE TODAY."
4,Nice Trip to The Great Barrier Reef ( I. M. X),"This trip is filled with splendid and natural views in one of the best world area, with its wonderful sea life.you will travel through the views in addition to high quality music.It is relax and comfort day, during which you will travel with I.M.X and get deeply through the Great Barrier Reef to enjoy its natural views."
1,"Might be a decent workout, but...","I'm an avid fan of workout DVDs, and I just got this one, never having bought a Firm DVD before. What a disappointment! The first 5 minutes of the DVD are an advertisment for ""The Firm"" products...and to be sure, you have to have each and every one to follow along with this workout. I don't have the double-decker Fanny Lifter, I don't have the Sculpting Bar (or whatever it's called)...I just have myself, some dumbbells and an urge to workout. That's not enough for this workout."
3,Too easy,"I purchased the fanny lifter and a combination Firm dvd that I loved. I was using them for a while and then thought I'd try this one. I found this one way too easy for some of the exercises, particularly the lower body. The upper body portion was good though. I didn't see the usefullness of the ""pole"" that she was using, so I'm glad I didn't go out and purchase that. Overall, I think it's an okay workout, but not one of the Firm's best."
4,not bad for a beginner,So far I have done 2 of the four workouts on this DVD and I liked them both. They were short and sweet(which is really good for a beginner....or a new mom like me) I really felt the burn the first few times I've done them...but I've only had them for 2 weeks now. I really like the stability ball Ab routine....it's my favorite so far. The three women in the video are not annoying and too smiley like in some exercise videos. All in all a great purchase.
3,Had the cass. but wanted the CD...,"This CD was pretty good. Brings back that 90's flavor. Songs like ""You got me crying"" and ""Apple Juice"" make it worth while. The fact that the older brother did the production made it a sound issue from Motown."
3,So so Tribal,"I love tribal but found this to be loooooong. Even fabulous Rachel Brice was just ok. Great filming but I found this dvd to be a bit dark for my taste, some I couldn't bear to watch because of the hard heavy metal music. It wasn't my taste at all. There was some good costume ideas and a couple of good performances but overall dull and unremarkable."
5,Must have,Works for about 1 year when storing fuel this was another great Amazon purchase there is another product that works better but is very expensive
5,Must use this when you store gasoline,"Add this to gasoline you're storing, either in a container or your lawnmower or snowblower, especially if it's going to sit for more than a few weeks."
5,Riveting!,"Absolutely riveting; great acting, great story lines; great Boston scenery; it is a shame that quality shows like this don't make it on television, while mindless sit-coms go on for years!"
5,One of a kind show,"Relying more on the the depth of the characters than violence and bravado, The Black Donnellys is an intelligent show that succeeds where most ""mob"" series fail: network television.I was skeptical myself of a network show about organized crime. It's been tried before and has always failed miserably. Even the Soprano's doesn't work on A&E.; The Black Donnellys is 10 times the show the Sopranos was. I think the biggest problem was that it came out just as the Sopranos was coming to an end and many people were over mob series. Once people watch the show they are able to see that this show is about much more than the crime.The show's strong point is it's writing. Using the rise of the Donnellys to the head of the Irish mob in New York as a background, the show is really about the complexities of human emotion and actions and how they are shaped by culture and experience.Everyone should buy this DVD now and maybe we can save the show!!!!"
4,I Cant Believe Im The First,"I cant believe that i am the first person to write a review for this album as its excellent. This is Reef's third album and its my favourite. This album contains tracks like New Bird, Sweety, Ive Got Something To Say and Metro. It would be a mistake if any Reef fan missed out on this album"
4,The gift of communicating complex material simply.,"I have read the ""website version"" rather than the book itself. The very readable story acts as a ""wrapper"" for some extremely complex and complicated religious understandings to which the reader is introduced, and with which the reader then becomes involved, painlessly and entertainingly. Few are those with the gift of so doing, and the authors have created a really first class ""introduction manual"" to faith/faiths which can hardly fail to stimulate any reader's interest in religious matters."
2,"Expert Advice, Well Hidden","There's no doubt that Blaszczak knows MFC. Expertise nonwithstanding, however, the book suffers and ultimately fails for two reasons: poor writing infused with distracting try-too-hard humor, and an index that's so far off in the weeds as to be utterly useless. If you feel you must purchase this book, try reading a few pages first; if the author doesn't annoy you within two pages, you may get along with him just fine.Count on this, however: you WILL need a different book as a reference. The index, when it contains what I'm looking for at all, is often several pages off target. Most often, though, I can't even find what I'm looking for in the index.The party's pretty much over for MFC anyway, and thank God for that. At least Microsoft finally came to their senses and cloned much of Java for their C#/.NET stuff."
4,Reasonable kitchen timer for the money,"Looks funky, good gadget for modern kitchen.Nonstandard interface (turn outer dial to set)Beeps loud for one minute when going offGives you time elapsed since going off (counts down ro 0 then up)Entertaining to set with one fingerMust remove from fridge to switch from clock mode to timer (buttons on back)Plastic stand on back flimsy but functional for occasional use.Can fit in shirt pocket if leaving kitchen while things cook.Overall, recommended.Edit - 1 year later - the magnet came off the back. Replaced w/doublesided tape. Otherwise still going strong on the original battery after daily use. Still recommended."
4,The Perfect Man,"The Perfect Man by Jenny Markas is an exhilarating story of friendship and romance.The book takes place in a Brookland apartment. Two girls and their mom have been moving from one town to another since Holly, the oldest daughter, was born. When they end up in Brookland, they embark on a wild adventure. Jean (their mom) meets a guy named Lenny, who is a real ditz. When they go on their first date, Holly decides to make up the perfect man, Ben. Holly sends fake e-mails, IM's, letters, and even phone calls to Jean from Adam (her friend`s) house just to make Jean happy. When the plan comes crashing down, Holly has to go to drastic measures to set things right, that's where it gets exciting!We give this book 4 **** .It was fantastic, and we would recommend it to all our friends."
5,Obscure Sonata Attributed to Mozart Found!,"It was very difficult to find a recording of the sonata I'm preparing with my pianist because it is only ""attributed to"" Mozart. When I finally found this CD, I was really happy - but also somewhat skeptical of what the quality would be like. It's been a wonderful CD with crisp, clear sound and excellent level of musicianship for both the pianist and violinist. It arrived at my door in less than a week."
3,Not as good as previous Firm workouts,"I bought this DVD expecting the same high-end production as the previous Firm videos and similar challenging workouts. I was disappointed in both respects. I have been an avid Firm follower for the last six years. But since their production has changed (for whatever reason), their workouts lack the same stylish sets, less challenging exercises and even the music doesn't seem as fun. Granted, nice sets and music do not make a workout better, their approach has changed and I felt let down. I don't feel as challenged during the workout. I would definitely recommend the older series of videos. Also, noting on a comment in a previous review about the tattoos on Ali, I also was not too impressed with this. I personally prefer my instructors tattoo-free (or at least in places I can't see them)."
2,NOT for beginners!,"Maybe someday I'll be able to get through all of it, but I don't know what some of these reviewers are talking about when they say this tape is too easy. If you are serious exerciser and have used a ton of the FIRM tapes in the past it might be easy, but if you are new to exercising at all (as I am)or really out of shape and am finally motivated to get moving (as I am) this is a tough place to start. The instructor goes so fast that I miss have the steps and don't really know if I am even doing them correctly because it's so rushed. Plus, having five other instructors as the people exercising in the background really isn't that motivating- they have obviously done this routine a million times! As it is now, I do five minutes and stop the tape, then another five and stop the tape. I'm dying!! I'll get through it eventually, if I don't find a better tape first."
2,Not for the advanced,"I own quite a few Firm workouts; this workout is not for the intermediate or advanced exerciser. There is no physical demand on your heartrate, and little, if no use, of weights. There is no real sense of the compound movement that the Firm is known for. The cuing is insufficient, and use of the sculpting stick can be replaced by the use of weights. If you are looking for a better cardio challenge, pick Super Cardio or Cardio Burn (yes, similar name but different instructor)."
4,Too Easy,I just got this tape and found it way to easy. This is a great video that's well choreographed and I like Allie very much as an instructor but it's more for beginner/intermediate. I hardly broke a sweat. If your advanced The Firm Cross Trainers Super Cardio kicks butt. I was looking for a tape that compares to the Super Cardio and was disappointed when I used the Maximum Cardi Burn.
1,misleading product description,"The item was described as having A/V outputs that included an S video jack for the video output. My fault in assuming that it included RCA type jacks for the audio as well. The kit includes a standard USB cable, a number of inserts to size the dock for your particular Ipod and a little stand to hold your ipod in the upright position. The one and only reason to buy this product is the s-video output, otherwise it's no better than the original accessories that came with your Ipod. I had hoped to connect to my home stereo. Don't buy it if that's what you're intending it's a waste of money."
5,Wonderful grits,"So glad to find these. It's hard to have homemade biscuits and ""quick"" or, God forbid, ""Instant"" grits. Put these on first and by the time the rest is ready, you have fabulous grits. I am a cook so time to do this isn't an issue. Try them once and you won't go back!"
1,Beware,"[[ASIN:B0002XIC0U Quaker Old Fashioned White Grits 1 lb 8 oz. container - 6 Unit Pack]Absolutely tasteless goo. Not a hint of true flavor found in the original Quaker Old Fashion grits and I don't mean the more recent ""Instant"" and ""Quick"" Quaker grits. I was appalled. I hope Amazon will find something better."
5,Didn't tip over for Tribbs,"When I brought my guinea pig home (Tribbs) he kept tipping the cheaply food bowl that came with his cage over, so I figured I would have to get either one that would strap to the wire cage, or a ceramic bowl. This bowl is heavy enough to support him when he eats and picks the treats out of his food bowl. Happy with this product. Also I went with the cheap shipping and it came in half the time they thought it would. Very happy with Amazon and this product."
