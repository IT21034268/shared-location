1,avoid at all costs!,"I bought this game with the hopes that Bethesda took their previously successful game ""Burnout"" (which I own), and upgraded the graphics. wrong!The box should read, ""for ages up to 8yrs"". It is really that bad!Futhermore, when I saw that Dan Fletcher (NHRA Superstock racer from Div 2)was on the cover, I thought, or hoped, that he had some input to the accuratcy of the game. NOT!THIS GAME, IN NO WAY, SIMULATES REALITY! The game was probably designed by some low rent intern that has never seen a dragstrip.Having been involved in NHRA drag racing for 20 years, I find calling it, ""Sportsman Edition"" the insult of the century!Shame on you Bethesda! you really blew it with this one."
4,Teac AG-D9320 5.1,"Teac AG-D9320 5.1 rated at 130 watts per channel in stereo and 100 x 5, it high instantaneous current capability. The AG-D9320 contains massive capacitors within the all-discrete amplifier circuits that maintain the current through even the harshest demands."
4,Great Mix,"Well done. Great mix of archival footage with contemporary filming. Only wish it were longer, and had shown pictures after the blast, and finished the stories of survivors."
1,Defective Product,"This product arrived defective. Pictures of the defect were sent to Amazon customer service who forwarded them on to Butterfly, the manufacturer, who agreed that the product was defective and would be replaced. That was more than 45 days ago."
2,A little gritty,"I use calcium carbonate powder in my bread dough and hot cereal to make sure that my family gets enough calcium -- the children don't drink much milk, they don't like it.this is the 1st time I've tried this brand. I found it to be a bit gritty. I don't notice it in the bread dough, but it is noticeable in the hot cereal. I like the Now Nutrition brand better."
5,Use of calcium carbonate powder,"Taking calcium in tablet form is expensive and easy to forget to do. Calcium carbonate is what manufacturer's use to fortify numerous products. I especially like using this product for baking. By adding a heaping teasponful into the flour mixture I use to bake with (pancakes, cookies, bread, thickening for sauces), I am able to effortless provide the daily calcium requirements for my family. This is particularily important since I have children that are allergic to milk products. This is the only vitamin that is not readily acquired in full amount in most people's diets, and I recommend highly using this product in this form (vs mixing in juice or other beverages)."
1,More Complicated than it has to be,"I was dissapointed in this video. It drags on and on explaining hand positions that I know are too complex for babies. If your child is deaf and you want to use sign language with them forever this may work for you. For most people I'd suggest the ""Baby Signs"" system. I found ""Baby Signs"" to be simple, well researched, and very successful. They have a book and a video that you watch with your infant. My baby loves it and it really works!"
1,ok....I admit....I only glanced at this book in the store...,"I thought at first it looked like it might be a great overview for me. BUT then I was flipping through it and came to this explanation of a byte (a paraphrase since the book is not in front of me):A byte is a character and has seven or eight bits.Now, in my little world, if a byte could be either 7 or 8 bits, computers would have an awfully tough time interpreting them. And to say that a byte is a character? Oy. I agree with the review below mine based on that one paragraph in her book. If someone cannot even manage to explain correctly what a byte is, they have no business writing telecom books."
4,Perfect Overview for consultant with no Telecom background,"I'm an IT consultant with a good understanding and background in network design, and needed to get a quick grounding in telecom for a project. After spending a day in the bookstore,( and actually buying and returning another title), I found this book and took it home. It was the perfect overview of the subject for me! I got a good understanding of the terminology and foundation concepts, and often go back to certain sections to reinforce my understanding.I gave it four stars rather than five because ot does have some flaws. As noted in some other reviews, the author glosses over key data communications topics like routing, bridging, VoIP. For those readers who need depth in these topics, there are better sources (Try titles by Radia Perlman or Uyless Black, for example).For readers who need a strong fundamental understanding of telecom technologies, regulations, and implementations, this is the best general primer out there."
2,Good scope but miserable organization,"I bought this book because it appeared to be one of the few books aimed at non-technical readers that covered major telecoms concepts. While the scope is not disappointing, this book is so poorly organized that I simply stopped reading it. The book's disorganization and repetitiveness exist at several levels: across chapters, within chapters, and even within paragraphs.On numerous occassions, the author uses a term or concept in a way that assumes a thorough understanding (prompting the reader to ask himself ""has this already been introduced?""), then drops it, then explains it later on. In addition, some concepts are explained multiple times, with no real difference in the various explanations. Finally, often the sentences are so clumsily put together that the style simply prevents the reader from concentrating on the content.A big disappointment."
5,Simple descriptions to complex technologies.,This book is very informative for anyone who is interested in Telecommunications.
5,Ms. Dodd knows what she's talking about.,"I've looked at a lot of ""telecommunications"" books. And this book stands out like a gem. This book is even up-to-date with some high-level (decision-maker level) information on DSL technology."
5,Excellent advanced COM+ book,"I started my COM+ learning experience with Peishu Li's ""Visual Basic and COM+ Programming by Example"" and then used this book to get a more advanced look at COM+. This was NOT money wasted. I highly recommend both books to users wanting the learn about COM+ and n-tier. This book is very well written. Developers with a background in MTS may want to skip the ""by Example"" book but you definitely want to read this book. Scot Hillier understands COM+ (and MTS for that matter) and his style of writing is pleasant to read."
1,Not for traditional interest,Sorry but this CD was a major disappointment for me. Don't think I'll get another from this artist.
4,"Gotta love Gabriel, but I expected a bit more.","I am a Gabriel fan. His music has always been inspirational and cutting edge. His ""Growing Up"" concert tour was the best concert I have ever been to. And with classic videos like ""Sledgehammer"" and ""Digging in the Dirt"" you can't go wrong. But some of the videos seemed to rob the music of it's greatness. And in some, like ""Blood of Eden"" the music used is not the same version that I remember listening to on his CDs. Some songs let me down and some videos fell short of what I would expect. I liked the touch up on ""Shock the Monkey"" video, however.The special features were nice. I liked being able to get a bit of background on each video if I wanted it.Over all, since I love his music, I think it's a great buy and will keep this DVD on hand. I just wish the music would have been slightly revamped and that more of the less phenomenal videos would be updated like ""Shock the Monkey"" was."
1,bad quality,I was not able to use the watch as the black plastic was not able to stick to the watch it self. The voice is also not very clear so it is difficult to understand what time she is announcing.
5,Avril Rocks,"I love the theme song by Avril Lavigne (correct spelling for all u real-music haters), she makes it sound cool and peppy.The other songs are okay though"
4,Annoyingly good,When I got this CD for my children I had no clue what I was getting myself into. The music is funny and even I found myself singing along to titles like Spongebob Squarepants Themesongs or the GOOFY GOOBER SONG. hahahaha I tell you I felt never this connected to my kids and you have to admit we are all kids on the inside.I have to admit that you can only listen to this CD for so long before going nuts and after hearing the GOOFY GOOBER ROCK for the 50th time I had to tell my kids to turn it of or mami was going to go gaga.But watching my kids singing along to this CD and seeing them playing airguitar it was still worth buying.
2,Scholarly Work,"I cannot speak to how this book sums up aviation safety, as I have only a vague overview of the aviation industry as it relates to space systems. His references and understanding of key respected theorists like Maslow and Reason however, leaves much to be desired. While he may be able to speak and write effectively about safety in the aviation industry, his application of most theory in his book is less than stellar and should not be used as scholarly reference."
4,Highland escape!,"Despite the previous reviews on this novel, I read it anyway. I was delightfully surprised and found the book to be very refreshing rather than cliche! The historical backgroud was very authentic and allowed me to escape to the picturesque highlands of Scotland!"
1,No,"This is simply very cheezy pop metal-type stuff. It doesn't get better than the samples. There is no experimentation, just reletless bad beats with some vocals like the ones on ""Urban Indian"" ""all these canyons of sound/i'm an urban indian"" ""all these urban coyboys/in their ford thunderbirds/are just buffalo herds/to the urban indian"" I understand that they are a good band, but I think this should be the last of their that you buy. First of all, it was released in 1993 which is always the kiss of death for a 70's band. This is the worst of prog with the worst of pop metal rolled into a wall of Krautsuck. Sorry dudes. OH, AND THIS WAS NOT A RELEASE BY THE 60'S - 70'S CLASSIC BAND AMON DUUL OR AMON DUUL II, THIS IS A THIRD BAND WHICH IS A SIDE-PROJECT OF THE MUCH-HATED HAWKWIND."
2,mixed review,"i pretty much bought this album for one song, 'pushin' back days.' while that song is amazing, much of the album is what i consider to be unlistenable. much of the lyrics are completely lame and cliche rhymes. the music is OK but some of it is pretty dull alt pop. some of the songs are decent and could maybe grow on you, like chocolate and batwing. i guess if you get a good deal on it this album is worth the few good songs on it."
5,A book that gets to the Real heart of it,"There's No Such Thing as a Negative Emotion cuts right through the web of voices that have always told me what i was feeling was what was in the way of who i am. After several reads and alot of work i am understanding that what i feel IS who i am. Daniel Barron takes the reader on a return journey to the emotions we have run from, meditated to transcend, perspectivized into little compartments, and relegated to the shameful corners of our lives. At turns complex and simple, Barron's work explains the architecture of the emotional body , tells the story of how we developed into the current versions of ourselves and how to find our way to the selves we could have been if we had received all of the emotional nourishment required for our greatest expression. I wish this read for anyone who aches to find out who they truly are at Heart."
3,Canned Heat with no notes-unknown,"This CD has no information inside--no idea when it was recorded-the dates of the live cuts or who was in the band at that time is not indicated--it is just a cd with a blank side to the front label. The sound quality is fair at best--it sounds like Bob Hite is the singer and a few tracks sound like Harvey Mandel is on guitar, but no information is given. I would skip this one and get the Boogie album---this one stinks!!!!!!!!!"
5,No Saab driver should be without!,"This book is so hard to find! I had to get it for my brother who is a Saab fanatic and he LOVES it. It's the thing to have if you love Saabs. Even if you don't, the photos are amazing so it's great to flip through. If you know someone with a 9-3 this one's the best:Saab 9-3or a 9-5:Saab 9-5: a Personal Story"
4,A good DCOM tutorial book with informative sample code,"In general, I like the book with its informative sample code. If some one is trying to leran DCOM programming, this book is definitely a good tutorial. Aside from that, I have a few gripes:(1) There are some errors in its compaion CD-ROM. For example, the MIDL compiler always generate a *.h file which is different from the ones on the CD-ROM.(2) In Chapter 7, the OrderEntry object hierarchy example lacks a professional RDBMS schema design. The author should have used an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) or UML notations to illustrate the corresponding RDBMS schema design.(3) Since the author works for Microsoft, it seems that the author was rather bias without mentioning any pitsfall of the COM/DCOM model, such as its binary-only proprietariness and the lack of Trader Service as found in the Corba spec, which I think is essential in developing and deploying a true enterprise distributed system."
2,A waste of resources,"Okay ""reefer madness"" might've been so uniquely hokey that we get a laugh or two. I doubt that it was even effective in its day. However it has moved to a sort of cult classic.However this presentation of ""sex madness"" does not even get off the ground. The poor acting is just that, poor acting and stilted dialog is just that, stilted dialog. To keep you interested in this they have to throw in wild parties, sex out of wedlock, lesbians, and the kitchen sink.This alpha video presentation is not even worth renting. It might be a great gag gift for somebody you don't like.The basic story is of a young girl going to the big city to make it big. She gets caught up in a casting couch; and this casts the way shall be for the rest of her life.Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired"
5,Beautiful Metal,"There are many female fronted bands these days, this one has to be one of the best. Strong, fast ethereal sound and a lady with a voice custom made for this release. The sound is highly enginerred, but that is the point. Is a complete package, almost a concept album, a dream like atmosphere in pure metal form. Highly recommended."
4,"Not normal Pumpkins material, but definitely a great CD.","This CD is different from all the other Smashing Pumpkins' CD's in the sense that it's lighter, softer, and less stressful. It seems that the songs contain much less anger than their last album, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. I also noticed that Billy Corgan seems to be trying a different technique with the vocal harmonies. It's a little twisted, but I think it's a good CD."
1,"Not the Pumpkins, and too one-dimentional","I am a big pumpkins fan, but let's face it, this is not a good CD. The only catchy songs are Ava Adore and Daphne Descends, and maybe Perfect. other than that, all the songs sound the same, too electronic and uncreative, and pretty much a Billy Corgan solo album. I do not consider it a Pumpkins album for the reason that Billy Corgan is the only member of the new SP line up that participated on the album. I consider Zeitgeist a Pumpkins album because the two core original members of the band created it. D'arcy and James Iha are a dime a dozen, and hardly participated in the recording process, only Jimmy and Billy.This album is not good, and the terrible sales prove it."
1,This album stinks compared to the other SP albums,I bought this album and was very disapointed when I listened to it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!
5,the wonderful pumpkins,"i love the smashing pumpkins. period. i know that because im 16 most people think that i am too young for them, but i got into them when i was 8 years old and have been a devout follower ever since."
4,"Unpredicted then, and underrated still","Most Smashing Pumpkins look down on this synth-ful album in late '90s. At that time, when I first heard this, it was very astonishing because of its difference from their privious albums. However, I did think that this was an improvement from rather pretentious ""Melan Collie"". If you're a die-hard metal fan, this even danceable music would not fit in your ears. However, the music itself is, when evaluated by general view, very rich and of high quality. I would give Siamese Dream a 4 and a half stars, and this a 4 stars, rather 3 stars to Melan Collie."
4,Brilliant,"I have listened to every song on this album many times and they just get better and better. None of the songs are as good as disarm, but there is no really bad song on it. Best song:Perfect Worst song:Annie dog"
3,Fair,This new cd by The Smashing Pumpkins is very different from anything they've done before. However half of the cd is quiet slow and boring the other half has good potental.
2,THIS ALBUM SUKS BUT YOU TRY TO LIKE IT CAUSE ITS THE PUMKINS,"POOR BILLY CORGAN TOOK TOO MANY FRUITY PILLS WITH MARILYN MANSON LAST YEAR{SOURCE:THE MARILYN MANSON BOOK,I FORGOT WHAT ITS CALLED,PICTURES OF BILLY AND MM}AND TURNED INTO A WANNABE GOTH. BELIEVE ME I WORSHIP THE PUMPKINS AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN EVERYONE ELSE BUT THIS ALBUM SMELLS LIKE MY KITTY LITTER{HELLOKITTYKAT}BOX. I MISS BILLY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS CHANGED THEIR PERSONA.I MISS HIS ALTERNA-TOT ATTITUDE. MOST OF ALL I MISS HIS DAMN GUITIAR.I BELIEVE IT'S ALL JIMMYS FAULT FOR BREAKING UP THE SUPER BAND OF MY LIFE BUT ITS ALL OVER NOW . SIAMESE DREAM GISH AND MELLON COLLIE WERE ALL SPECTACULAR ALBUMS BUT THEY REALLY FOULED IT ALL UP WITH THIS ALBUM. I LOVE YOU BILLY .COME HOME AND FIND YOUR ROCKIN ROOTS. WE WANT THE OLD ROCKIN PUMPKINS BACK. NO MORE POSER LAME TECHNO INFLUENCED GARBAGE.PLEASE."
4,The music is mellow and moodful and different.,The first time I listened to this album I was a little suprised how different it was from thier other albums but after hearing it more I began to appreciate different aspects of the music. I hope the next album is a little more hard core but I still would by because pumpkins is pumpkins.
4,"Great album, but maybe a little bit too many accoustic songs","Adore doesn't have the music that we used to know from the Smashing Pumpkins. The songs are too soft and accoustic. No heavy guitar solos like in previous albums of the Pumpkins. Although, the album is definitely worth buying!"
5,THE coolest CD!!!!!!!!,THIS IS THE COOLEST CD OF ALL EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you should buy it right NOW!!!!!!!!
4,Billy Corgan dusts off his 80's record collection for a new direction,"Although releasing an 80's inspired, gothic infused record at the height of the britpop phenomenon back in1996 was probably not the best career move, adore the bands forth studio album, found the pumpkins veering away from the more traditional grunge sound of their earlier releases to more textural soundscapes and in places reveals Billy corgans love of New Order and other 80's electronica inspired bands something he would also explore on 2003's zwan mary star of the sea album. From sparse piano tinged ballads (For Martha) and Zeppelinesque (Tear) through to the lilting Once upon A time, Adore contains some of the pumpkins prettiest and most affecting songs an album that proves more rewarding with each play rather than an instant hit those seeking the bands more commercial work should start elsewhere."
4,Really good.,"I was sort of shocked when I first heard their songs on RealAudio. The music was totally different than previous albums. But that's a bad thing? Adore is a very good album, with many beautiful melodies and enjoyable songs I listen to over and over again. I wouldn't mind it if the Pumpkins kept their genre like this. Corgan focuses his lyrics on love, friendship, and also tries to find meaning in life. A very good album. One of the best I have."
3,Adore has its highs and lows,"The brand of rock popularized by the Smashing Pumpkins can still be found on Adore, but they have moved more towards the sounds found on the second portion of their previous double album. Be warned: if you are buying the album for the sounds of Ava Adore, you will be disappointed. The almost techno feel of the song is not carried through most of the other songs. Hints of the techno creep up, but in general the album is toned down."
5,Review THIS album,"The problem with most reviewers, is they base their review of this album, based on what the previous albums sounded like. Hence, all the bad reviews. Stated quite simply, this is an excellent and different album. It's very funny to see all the grunge and hard rock fans say how much they hate this. I guess they'll have to stick with Pearl Jam (who haven't put a decent album out since Vs.). This type of reviewing is a tradgedy (Mansun's ""Six"" was a victim of this also). Excellent and recommended."
4,for de peeps what hate de pompkins,"me, i been hating de pompkins longtime, mon. (i call dem de pompkins for because dey so very pompous/bombastic, dontchaknow). oh but dis be de disc for de peeps what hate de pompkins, for de folk dat only like de ""1979"" cause it remind dem of de greatest band in de universe--dat would be New Order, mon... but a course you ben knowing dat longtime, eh?!) i hatey-hatey Billyboy's crooning much-much, but dis records sompfin else, mon. it good! me biggy-big surprise! rock on, most hated man in rock!"
1,Very Sterile,"It doesn't take a great musician to arrange music on a sequencer. If this was played with real musicians, it might have touched me."
2,A major disappointment,"I only give this two stars because of Marisa Mell otherwise it would only get one. The film itself is not a giallo despite claims to the contrary. Worst of all is the quality of the transfer. It looks like it was made off of a VHS dupe. Terrible! MYA should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this. To add insult to injury, the trailer on the DVD has better color and is English language, which is obviously how the film was shot. The movie itself is in Italian with English subtitles."
4,James Bond #3,"The DVD's we did receive were very good quality. Unfortunately, when we attempted to watch the GoldenEye movie, we found it missing! The manufacturer had put in two of the same From Russia with Love DVD special feature discs instead! Frustrating. Now we have to package them up to send back and hope that we get our correct package..minus all that postage & shipping!"
1,Oddly written book,"I really dislike this book for two reasons:(1) it assumes the reader already possesses a certain technical vocabulary; and (2) it is oddly formatted -- you will be going along reading the text, and then there will be an indented set of paragraphs that clearly is taken from a product manufacturer's materials, without introducing it properly or saying where it is excerpted from (probably footnoted to the bibliography in the back of the book). The flow is really bad, and basic questions are left unanswered."
4,Kid tested and approved!,"My husband and I took our 3 1/2 yr old niece to the toystore Barbie isle and let her pick any toy she wanted and this was the one. She absolutely LOVES it! She hesitated between this one and another Fairytopia doll but since pink is her favorite color I think she chose this one in particular.I gave 5 stars simply because of how much she loves it, 1 star because it's not educational at all as far as I can see. 3 stars for durability and 4 stars overall."
1,UGLY!!!!!!!But not ugly in the movie.,This is the worst fairytopia doll ever.She is ugly and she has an ugly face I am almost 12 and I am not a Barbie fan longer.-Barbie in the Nutcracker doll is cute.-Barbie as Rapunzel doll is great.(I have her).-Barbie of Swan Lake is gorgeous.(I have her).(But dont see the movie.It (...) stinks).-Barbie as the princess and the pauper.Erika is more beautiful than Anelise.-This Barbie fairytopia doll is (...) ugly.DONT GET HER!
4,Styx before Shaw,This is the early recording of Styx before Tommy Shaw joined the band.I particularly liked the first 2 albums but all were good material.They may have been more commercially successful with Shaw but their music was never better on these first recordings.
3,"I HAD TO MAKE THEM FIT, NOT SO CUSTOM","Not a custom fit for my 04 Yukon, spent the whole day experimenting with drill hole positions, they still are not a perfect fit, you may have to make them fit, got it done and they decent.im just upset about the time it took to install them, but it is what it is, so i will be keeping them, i wish it was a better fit, but oh well , if its not a true custom fit just say its not."
1,McAffee is infuriating,"I have used McAfee virus-scan for years.I am extremely irritated by them from time to time. Their program causes pop-up adds to periodically appear from my task-bar telling me that I can buy all sorts of upgrades and add-ons to their virusscan program for only $29.99. The pop ups ARE NOT browser windows. They come from the virusscan program itself. I do not want my computer to become an advertizing agent for them! Furthermore, I would like to be able to give powerpoint presentations to large audiences without having the pop-ups interrupting my talk.I have not been able to stop these pop-ups, and it pisses me off every time it happens. I just went to their customer support page, and they won't talk to me about this issue unless I pay them."
2,The Seed Bead Book,"Very disappointing. Uninspiring, simple and rather ugly projects. I wasn't moved to try one. A waste of money and time."
2,Keyboard,"I have owned tis keyboard and mouse for a few days now. I loged onto my other computer to google logitech, when i found that the keys z, x, c, v, m, and ENTER did not work. the keyboard was great until this horrible glitch."
2,ok,The quality of the video is bad in certain areas...makes the movie in those areas almost impossible to watch...good thing I have seen the movie before
3,Sorry fell asleep for a second,"This is a pretty good B movie and with a B list cast and some pretty over acted lines it just barely passes the why did I rent this level. There were a couple good parts and of course I normally like anything with Robert England in it. The best killing was the worm rape, which was also the main T&A; portion of the film. The story itself was solid and the pyramid was cool enough to support the film in its own way.For all us B movie fans this is a keeper so have fun with it."
3,Not Bluray worthy,"My son got me the blu release of this movie. I liked the movie way back when more than I do now but I would have thought that the Blu experience would really bring things out.It was a very poor reproduction, as though I was watching an old broadcast on the old tube tv. If you like the movie, buy the regular version and not the blu, if the price is right."
5,Nice Copy,"It's a copy of my father's first book , why wouldn't I love it . I ran out of copies and he passed away 35 years ago ."
2,"It works, but it doesn't work","I used this item with fine results for quite some time. Then, like other reviewers, I couldn't lock the lid. Obviously if the lid won't lock then the processor won't work. It was so frustrating that I finally just tossed it in the garbage. Now I have a brand new Kitchenaid Food Processor. It cost more, but I believe it was well worth it to get a quality product."
1,Very Disappointed,It burnt up the first time I used it. I was replacing a very cheap brand that took years to burn up. Do not waste your time or your money.
1,They Don't seem to last,I have purchased three of the Cigar Oasis XL Plus units and only one still works. Within a year ywo of the units started running continually keeping the humidity too high. The 3rd unit is still working knock on wood. For the money the units should be more reliable.
4,The original structural analysis reference,"This book is extremely comprehensive, and contains lots of practical advice for solving various structural analysis problems. Some of the info is a little out-of-date (i.e., charts and plots containing otherwise helpful information about alloys and structural materials that are not often used anymore in the aerospace industry). But the concepts and methods are sound and useful. This book is referenced by practically all other structural analysis books, and I find myself referring to it frequently at work."
3,Superman TAS Volume 3,"Unlike Batman TAS, the Superman version always had a cartoony feel to it. This is more than amplified on volume 3 on episodes like Warrior Queen but the Apokolips episodes kind of make up for the goofy ones. Volume 3 is a decent add if you want the entire series but if you are just a semi fan, stick with volume 1 or 2."
5,Stellar Fungk 2,"Double CD from the baddest band ever !!!!! I have to agree with TMACK79 though...I'm a huge fan of Slave also and I wonder WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET ""JUST A TOUCH OF LOVE"" IN CD VERSION? I own every cd that's available by them (the one's that are worth buying...any true fan knows which ones they are) and I bought this collection just so I could get ""Foxy Lady (Funky Lady)"" from the Just A Touch Of Love album. I rate it a 5 because it's Slave but let's re-issue the original albums ""Just A Touch Of Love"" and ""Bad Enuff"" so the true fans can listen to tracks like ""SHINE"" before we die. But on the real, if you are a fan of Slave and don't already own their stuff on CD, this is the one to get. Two disc cover both ""Stellar Fungk - The Best of Slave"" and ""Party Lights - More of the Best"". Save a little money and enjoy the FUNGK !"
1,Don't Waste your money!!,They must have found these old recordings outtakes someone made with a $35 casette recorder and decided to make some money. The sound quality is horrible and the singing is off key. It sounds like someone recorded it over the phone. There isn't one redeeming thing about this CD. Complete waste of money.
1,Forget about it!,"As I understand from the Steely Dan website, this is not an authorized SD release. They mention on their site that there are numerous bootleg demo and concert CDs out on the market, and unfortunately, Amazon has not escaped this phenomenon. I agree wholeheartedly with the earlier poster...don't waste your money.For more info on this, check out the official Steely Dan website (specifically, their list of ""album-length, authorized, commercial (for sale) releases:[...]"
5,Great tunes,I really like the raw nature of the performances on this disk. Becker and Fagen show the tunes they wrote stand the test of time.
5,must buy,purchased kit to use cone shaped silver crimp. this kit is necessary to use scrimp due to the size of the screws in the scrimps and the free scrimps and extra beads dont hurt either. very easy to use. a hemostat is also a great tool to use to hold the wires in place while you tighten the screw in place.
3,A big list of restaurant that are useless for a backpacker,". The information about the history of London was Ok.. Ok with the walking tour. All the highlights and backdoor are inside this guideBUT...looking with a backpacker eyes... They should reduce the big restaurant list and make a better explanation of the highlights is the sight section.Just for your information, I love Lonely Planet...this is a constructive recommendation that I give to all the city guides...Another important thing, specially for what they call ""A city guide""...they should give more information (map and path) of the buses. Yes...it is not Paris...in London it is easy to find a map for the buses...free of charge...BUT ...I am paying more that US$15 for a city guide, man...they should include.So, I think, less restaurant and better transport and sight information."
3,Good but room for improvement,"I normally have no complaints about Lonely Planet books - I've used them repeatedly. The London book is good with great maps, descriptions, directions, and updated admission costs and times, however, I found two things below my expectations: While the maps are good, this edition did not list supermarkets as most other Lonely Planet books do. (When touring on foot as I normally do, I like stopping in to a supermarket for a quick snack or drink - usually quicker and less expensive than going to a restaurant.) The other feature I found confusing is listing sights outside of London proper with no directions on how to get there. If I wanted sights outside of London, I'd had bought the Britain edition! If excursions outside the city are listed, it would help to see how to get there and an indication of how long it would take to get there, so one can plan an itinerary."
4,"Great guide to London, could use more budget info","I used this book for a five-day trip to London, my first time there. It was very helpful, contained just the right amount of information, and gave useful suggestions of what to do with my limited time. I was a little disappointed with the lack of budget accomodations included in the book (hence the four stars instead of five) but otherwise, all of the recommendations I followed were great."
2,No more colorful maps at the back of the book...,"I've used Lonely Planet city guides for all of my trips (Sydney, Hong Kong, Beijing, Budapest, London), and I've really become accustomed to using the maps at the back of the book. I bought this latest edition of the London city guide as a gift for my sister who will be visiting there soon. When I took a look through the book, I was so disappointed at how much the format has changed. I didn't even glance at the information, so that's not what my review is about. I am just unhappy at how the maps have changed so much, and if you are like me and have used lots of other Lonely Planet city guides, it feels much less user-friendly than previous editions."
3,An easy read but not quite as inspiring as one wishes it to be,"Arden is a very good writer and knows how to combine visual with text for maximum effect. Most authors are either good with words, or else with visuals - but rarely both. I gave it 3 stars because this book in terms of strategic insight, is not as good as ZAG by Marty Neumeier."
5,"so funny, so refreshing, so true, I love it.","its not a book per se. It has advice, quirks, statements, short stories. a great bathroom read to smile about.I keep it in my toilet for everyone to see.(yes, i spray it with Lysol)"
4,"Simple read but not as great as ""It's not how Good you are...""","Simple read but not as great as ""It's not how Good you are..."" This one kind off compliments that other one so if you've got spare change and time, pick it up but don't expect it to be as great as the other."
1,Don't thik to use this bad product this for prisons Ok.,This product is bad and catch every think. Its color easy to change with touching.This product is active for prisons.
4,Pancake Turner,Very large spatula. Should be used if you have large cooking surface areas (griddle). Will not work well in smaller pans.
5,Life changer,"I read this book as a 4th grader, around 1958,after seeing a Disney TV series about the Swamp Fox (I can still sing the theme song). It caught my interest and led to reading other books near-by on the library book shelf, and now, some 50 years later, teaching history at the university level. Absolutely recommended for elementary level readers."
4,Cute Barbie!,Our 2 year old loves this and I love the fact that it is african-american color not blonde/blue eyes only- great idea to make one of each! It is very magical looking and fun and pretty durable. We like it alot!
5,Premium Live Tull,"This album is really an impressive catalog of great tull songs and great performances. The album was compiled on the 1978 European Tour. The album flows together brilliantly and I believe it's the best live album i've ever heard. Also, if you're looking for other great Tull, check out: Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, WarChild, Minstrel In The Gallery, Too Old To Rock and Roll..."
1,Misleadingly categorised,"I love historical fiction. I was looking forward to an escape book with a bit of love story. I got characters that behaved in ways that didn't quite work, cliches and very little history. I felt like I was reading a first attempt. Excessive use of the word ""Highlander"" does not a Scottish story make."
5,Loved it!,Wonderful story line. Couldn't put it down. Loved the characters in it. Had romance in it and a romance. Enjoy!
4,Child of the Mist,I loved this book. It was a great read. I enjoy reading Scottish stories and places and this book did not disappoint.
3,"Weak, as previous reviewer mentioned","I found this as a free Kindle read and thought I would give it a chance since many historically inclined romance novels do well. Reading this book was very confusing, it has all the correct elements of a romance but when a scene would come up it was as if a whole new author had reinvented these scenes into something scoured clean with Christian rhetoric. I only glanced at reviews before reading this book, but after finishing it and feeling mislead I understood what had happened. The original of this story was once mainstream romance plot but was cleaned up to be re-marketed as a Christian romance. I suppose as a religiously focused romance this one does alright, although I felt the plot was weak due to a distraction between developing a restrained sexual tension between the characters while trying to create a rich tapestry of subplot and supporting character motives, which wasn't fulfilled very well."
2,Book was boring,I didnt like this book. The book went on and on with the people fighting all the time.It was bump.
4,Rich in historical references and dialect,"If you are looking for a realistic historical romance, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. The dialect is realistic and fun to read. The descriptions of the environment are vivid and detailed. I found the book to be very well edited and easy to read. The only draw back for me was the story line. As I have read so many books in this genre I found the story itself to be a tried and true variety. Do not get me wrong though, as historical romances go this one is worth the read. I enjoyed it and it is well edited and smooth to read."
3,ok,The story is highly predictable. but an easy read. I enjoy Celtic history and stories so I was pulled in. I did finish it but will not follow any sequel. No real sex- a few hot kisses...but honestly could have had much more!
4,A strong and lovely heroine,"I enjoyed following the heroine find her strength and power while facing seemingly insurmountable hurdles. The underlying theme that true, strong love can overcome any turmoil is well played. I enjoyed the author's ability to paint a beautiful landscape, to create strong characters; but I did feel their hurdles were far too many and too overbearing, making it seem a little unrealistic at times. I found myself skipping a few chapters because I just couldn't bear to watch our heroine and her love struggle anymore. But it was a captivating story and served its purpose - entertaining me as I unwound from the day in my garden hammock chair."
3,Very good,"Being Scottish myself and a Christian, I was looking for a good book to read on my new kindle. This book was free, and I was unfamiliar with the author, so I didn't know what to expect. This turned out to be one of those books that I couldn't put down after I got into it. I found myself reading til the wee hours of the morning. There was not much spiritual depth, though, and some of the characters seemed to fall in love without developing into it. However, there was plenty action and mystery to keep me glued to the pages. I may be reading more of this author's books."
4,Child of the Mist,This was a good read. Kathleen Morgan is a good author and I would read more of her books. Thank you.
4,Good read,This book was okay. The main male character was a little annoying. He distrusted everyone but the people he shouldn't.
3,Fantastic read,I enjoyed the book and becoming involved in the characters lives. They allowed me to feel part of the adventure in life.
3,Ho Hum,Child of the Mist. I give this book 3 stars and the benefit of the doubt. Maybe my expectations were too high. It was written at a pre-teen / early teen level. The plot was predictable and the characters were not 3 dimensional but the writing was okay so i was able to get through it. I was put off in the end where the author asked readers to send suggestions for the next book in the series. I want the author to suprise me - not the other way around. I will not be reading anymore in this series.
2,Tedious at best,"For one, this book was a free download. I would have been upset if I had to pay for this book. It started out interesting where you get to learn about the strength of Anne's character as she confront's a band of Niall's men. They also learn from one another when he is taken prisoner and she tends to his wounds. Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from here. There were so many frustrating moments when they were quarrelling due to misunderstandings. Niall is literally as Anne calls him a ""pigheaded dolt."" Part way through the book, I was hoping Niall would come to a bad end so Anne would run off with Ian. But the most frustrating part of the book was the constant preachiness. Was I the only one who missed that this was supposed to be Christian lit? For one, I've read several levels with Scottish Highlanders and I'm not sure if the references to ""Christians"" and ""Jesus"" were appropriate. Weren't they supposed to be Catholic... Any way, I won't be reading else from this author."
3,Child of the Mist,I enjoyed this story . . . nothing better than a tale of a strong willed woman falling in love with an equally strong willed man.
3,Intimate and heavy on atmosphere,"Electronics, pianos, and acoustic guitars replace then-fired drummer Jimmy Chamberlain and the trademark buzzing squall. Results are mixed; songs range from catchy (""Perfect"") to pleasant (""Annie-Dog"") to pointless (a 17-second last track). Intimate and heavy on atmosphere, this album will please fans of the band's ""lullaby"" side."
2,time to move on,"K.A. Applegate has done a great job writing these books, but it's getting old. I like it when a series-style writer carries things over from her previous books, and she did that with the addition of Ax, the Hork-Bajir colony, the Helmacrons, and that David guy. I just wish she would have the Andalites FINALLY arrive. What is she waiting for?"
3,Could be better,kaa has written better animorphs but this was not that bad. there could have been a little more action and gafinilan probably would have acted a little more proud and arrogant if this was ever to happen. I would recommend buying this book even though it is not the best animorphs written. this is an excellent series to collect if you are in to sci-fi books. this book actually should be 3 1/2 stars.
1,Too many ideas spoil the novel,"I quite enjoy SF in general, including the hard stuff. But this was hard in a different way -- hard to make out what the heck was going on. Seemed like Metzger had lots and lots of coffee before writing this one, and couldn't bear to let any idea, no matter how zany, slip away. It was entertaining, but only because I borrowed it from somebody and didn't have to be mad about the money I paid for it. Head to Brin, Benford, or Niven for hard SF... avoid this one."
2,"Repetitive, Repetitive","The same information was rendered in the same way so many times, especially in the last third of the book, that I had to guess that Metzger had been tasked to come up with X number of words, so he just kept repeating himself until he had them. Worse, the publisher accepted an obviously rushed attempt without any editing. The book is full of unatributed dialogue and bad grammar. Maybe the editor slept through most of it.Metzger started with a good idea, including some interesting science. Then he treated both the science and the characters as if he were writing a fantasy. Most of the plot twists were no better than having a fairy suddenly appear and cast a spell. If Metzger had tightened it, if the editor had edited, if, if, if.It a sorry excuse for a book that should have been so much better."
2,I can't believe I read the whole thing,"I really should have given up when the first intelligent dinosaur appeared. The mental images the author evoked were incredibly ridiculous - there's a scene with Bill Gates, a dinosaur, a little green man looking lemur, and a girl in a hospital gown controlling infinite walls of fire and ice, one on each side of her. It was like a bad science fiction movie, only the author couldn't blame it on being constrained by reality or budget. I was intrigued by the first 100 pages or so, but it went downhill after that."
3,not a great purchase,"It is a great product and well built, but my daughter showed no interest in playing with it. Maybe the next kid will like it."
5,A Great Introduction to School,My 3 year old loves this book and makes me read it over and over. She cannot wait to go to preschool and I think the book is a great introduction to what it will be like.
5,get Anamorphic Widescreen version here!,"If you're looking for the Anamorphic Widescreen version of this movie, you'll need to buy the Region 2 UK release at Amazon.co.uk or here:Tall Tale: The Unbelievable Adventure [Region 2 PAL FormatorTall TaleGREAT, fun movie too!You will need a multi region DVD player to play this Region 2 DVD."
5,One of the best movies ever!,I grew up watching this and it is still a favorite. Everyone was cast perfectly. It has some wonderful life lessons. Movies like this are rarely made now. Great for the whole family.
4,Another Great Disney Movie,"I think this is a great Family movie.I was unable to purchase it here in NZ, becauseit was unheard of by our distributors.I loved watching my children watch it again."
1,Why is the cover so similar to the M.F. Cowlishaw book cover,Don't know anything about this book. I'm extremely familiar with M.F. Cowlishaw's 'A Practical Approach to Programming'. I'm wondering why O'hara's and Gomberg's book has an almost identical cover. This smells rotten.
2,Too hard to read,"While its a beautiful idea to make the book imitate the gold text and indigo rice paper of the Buddhist sutra that was the world's first printed book, the result is barely usable.The problem is that the gold ink of the text and illustrations do not have enough contrast against the indigo background that they are printed on. So its very difficult to read the book and its very difficult to look at the pictures, which means the book fails my purpose of buying it.This is sad because I really would like some Buddhist books for children. I do hope the author/illustrator tries again, but this time with the audience in mind instead of the desire to create a beautiful object."
2,Who's writing under Susan W. Albert's name?,"Not only was the plot rather uninvolving, but our wonderfully independent heroine blames herself for her lover's infidelity! The reconciliation with her rival seems rather forced. Can you imagine a guy holding hands with his woman's younger, studlier paramor and vowing to be friends? Hah! Having said that, I am about to read the next installment, hoping that it will be back to Albert's usual stellar quality."
1,For The Pseudo-Intellectual,"The mood and tone for this movie is set in the first four minutes, four full minutes, of watching a lady dry her finger nail polish. Yes, like watching paint dry on the wall or watching the grass grow. Regular people who live regular lives will probably not enjoy this flick. I guess if you live in the nut-ball world of Hollywood you might think it's great. Among the very worst movies I've ever watched."
2,Not good for a full size truck,"The bike rack might work better in a ranger or toyota truck but my F-250 we had to add a link that dosen't come in the kit to keep it stable and from moving around in the bed. Also, you have to strap the bikes to the rack, the little sliding lock things don't work on bikes over 20"". Will work with some modifications."
3,Ok rack,"This is a good product but, I had trouble getting it to fit in my 2012 F150 Crew-cab pickup truck."
1,"wasted my money, this thing is JUNK",Good idea but this thing is JUNK. It does not stay in place very well. The bikes keep trying to fall over thus pulling it away from the truck bed. If you have a full size truck like I do they don't give you an extension rod for the lower front saying it's not needed.
3,REVIEW OF BIKE RACK,"I ordered the rack to see if I could make it work on an 4 X 8 trailer and with several adjustments and drilled holes and bolts, and cutting some pieces out I was able to make it work fine. I have yet to take it on a long trip."
4,Ehh~,"Used this book for my intro to comp sci class in college. Nice references and reading. Although Amazon doesn't have it anymore, the price was kinda high when I bought it back then."
3,First Osho book,"I'm in high school and this was the first Osho book and only book so far that I have read. It did help me understand how to think more creatively and has several great quotes that will leave you analyzing everything you do in your life from the day you put the book down. He encourages an open mind yet is very direct on his religious beliefs at times which may be hard for some people to get around. I'm not too religious myself, but I did enjoy the different spiritual interpretations and comparisons. His action vs. activity section will leave you asking yourself why you ever watch tv or do anything non-creative at all. It will motivate you to not only do more with your life, but also help you think more outside the box. He does like to repeat himself a little bit which I actually liked instead of a beginning to end straight and narrow approach."
2,Locks did not work...,"I've bought the levers before and they've worked great. Bought three of these knobs and for whatever reason, all three of them didn't work when we received them. On one of them, the manual lock on the front was broken out of the package. On the other two, the locking mechanism inside sticks. About every third time you try to open it, the light is green but the knob won't turn at all, and greasing it didn't help either. We called the company and they sent replacement parts, so hopefully they work now!"
2,"""Sound enhanced"" don't mean Dolby, stranger!","The eight western episodes on this GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT product are certainly tempting. Be advised however that the description ""sound enhanced"" means cheesy modern music that's used in place of theme songs or during breaks in action where background score is brought forward. That's right. No Season 1 BONANZA theme here.Programs thus tampered with are very annoying, especially to those who remember how they originally sounded. I made the mistake of buying one of GENIUS's TV Guide ""sound enhanced"" box sets, but won't be purchasing others.Change the channel."
4,Movies are lots of fun and music,"After watching the Goldigger movies with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler and great set & numbers done by Bugsby Berkley and enjoying Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald movies that are bursting with Musical numbers and romantic songs i was pleasantly surprised by the work of Alice Faye presented in these movies. Her singing is different than other and that difference makes them fun to watch. Extras are great and you can feel and see how hard the movies were on Alice.So much music, so much talent."
2,Disappointing technical release,"The studio should have invested more in the film to dvd transfer, the colors are a real disaster especially in ""The Gang's All here"".I whish I could ask for a refund. You know now what to expect..."
4,This is the perfect book for a rainy afternoon,Stepmom is full of poignant and memorable characters that leave a lasting impression after the quick and easy read it offers. I immediately became engulfed in the storyline because Robb wrote with a certain style that allowed me to care about the characters while leaving me wanting to continue reading more until I had finished the book in it's entirity. I reccommend this book if you wanted to do some light reading over the weekend. It kept me occupied during the whole time I was sick with the flu. I am looking forward to reading more of Maggie Robb's literature perhaps in a heathier environment.
4,"A happy, sappy,sad book that has some family value's.",Stepmom by Maggie Robb is a bool about a family that has to go through a parent's seperation. Then the biologiacl mom gets a terrible illness that is deadly. Read on to seehow a illness can tear a family apart and at the same time bring a family together. Stopmom is a great book that I would recommend for teenagers that think family's are important.
1,A shameless tear jerker...,"The author pulled out all the stops to make readers pull out their kleenex. The mom is exemplary, the dad is perfect, the girlfriend is so Barbie-like. (By the way, how does one ""pick up an Armani habit""?) Even while up to their antics, the children are lovable. The plot is all too predictable; stereotypes and clichés abound. By comparison, the Brady Bunch seem much more real to life."
5,Feathered Star Quilts book,"This is a great book from Marsha McClosky, she makes very beautiful and very difficult quilts. The feathered star is beautiful."
4,radio,The radio is great I love the quality of the boss sound.The only problem is no master volume to trun up the subwoofers
4,is good,"This stereo is very beautiful and it sounds perfect for the pricethe audio functions are very goodBoss is a good brand, I have had many amplifiers of this brand and they have never failed"
2,"Interesting Plot, but not much substance","I usually read books in a few days... I've spent weeks on this one because it just doesn't hold my interest. The Magic of ""Illuminations"" is rather vague, and the rest of the plot is all too common. I'd wait for this to show up in used book stores."
4,an imaginative concept . . .,"New characters, new storyline, new magic. This time, we have two heros and two heroines facing incredible danger from different directions. Will they be able to save the world in time? This cliffhanger is the complete story in one volume. The ending left me smiling and content to savor the story. I didn't want to start another book and spoil the feeling"
3,This probably won't be helpful,"Um, I never got this product because the USPS refused to deliver it. Remember? But if they're anything like the lemon drops I used to eat at my grandmother's house when I was a kid, I'm sure they're delicious."
3,"Wonderful Party CD, but only the second one","The first CD is terrible. I tried to listen to it but just can't do it. The second one is wonderful, great compilation!"
3,not too good,cracked after less than a year why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is not too good. strange.
5,Wow,"That person that posted like 6 times trashing the album in like, 3 days straight must be sad.Maybe they like it since they come here so often thinking about the album."
4,It's not that bad!,I like these songs. They are catchy and light which is more than I can say for most songs you hear.Dreaming is one I can listen to over and over and Back Off is one I would like to play to people around me sometimes.There are some awful reviews around but I like this album and think its worth the money.
1,SAVE ME FROM THIS ALBUM!,"Why are people raving about these children? They are soooooooo annoying, they are talentless, and they are annoying. Why did people actually buy their past cd. This cd is a flop, it didnt even debut in the top 50 is australia, and it fell out of the charts in its 2nd week~ yay!!!!!"
1,Plain disgusting,"How dare these adolescents think that they are great! Frankie's voice is so whiney and annoying, its like fingers on a blackboard. I agree with all of the reviewers, these ppl are annoying."
1,"Dreaming, in a nightmare.","This album is a horrible array of bad, cheesy pop songs. Don't buy this album, it is a total waste of money!Recommended Tracks(or singles):Take Me As I Am - This song has such a good vocal featured in it.Open Up My Heart - Great duet, very good singers."
3,music of egypt...and no umm kulthum?,How can you make a CD of Egyptian music and leave off the most listened to singer in Egypt: Umm Kulthum?
5,THE BEST GRIDCORE ALBUM IN THE WORLD,This album has not been given the reconition it deserves and is defently better than any other grindcore album i have ever heard. It is in fact alot better than human 2.0 and is mabe one of the best albums under any heading. Nasum are an amazing band and i would strongly advise you to get this album. Infact if you don't you are missing out on life itself.
4,"""A Good Build-Up to a Pulse-Pounding Climax""","A first-rate, plausible job on this story. A Soviet sleeper agent rises through the ranks to command an LA-class attack sub. Then he uses it to sink US ballistic missile subs and neutralize American strategic power in the Pacific. Charles D. Taylor did a great job bringing the characters to life. Little by little he builds the tension, showing how the rest of the men under sleeper Wayne Newell's command react when they think they are at war. The stress, the pressure all start to wear at their psyche. Doubt creeps in, eventually the crew begins to question its captain. The strain of the mission pulls you in. Add to it the Naval commanders trying to figure out what's happening in the Pacific. The final, 3-way sub battle is a rush! You can't put the book down until you reach the end."
5,Incredible GAME,"This games is great in all aspects, from INCREDIBLE graphic, sound, fun, a little short but it does not matter with all the rest of the fun you can get."
5,newbie to this kind of thing,"My experience with video games has been the various older Mario games on the original NES system and Mario Kart Double Dash, which is so much fun to play. This was my first Xbox game and I think it's going to be difficult to find another game as amazing as this one.When first starting the game I felt completely incompetent, but it was so much fun that I just had to stick with it. I play GOW with my husband and we've even managed to complete the insane level. I highly recommend GOW, but if you're new to this type of game it would be helpful to have a more experienced player with you.My husband and I are now playing GOW 2 in Horde...it's stunning how quickly time flies when playing this."
5,What can I say?!,"If you haven't played Gears of War and you love action games, you are missing out. I just got an XBOX360 about two months ago and bought this game last month. I haven't played any of my other games on any other system since. It is a SCI-FI action adventure game that just looks great on a HD TV and the sound is amazing in the 5.1 digital surround sound. This game totally surrounds you. I enjoy the CO OP missions the most."
3,Amazing graphics; so-so gameplay,"As others have stated, the graphics of this game are incredible. However, the gameplay IMO gets pretty stale quickly. I played the entire campaign (way too short) in the easiest mode and am half-way through the hardcore level and am getting bored with it already. The weapons are not very exciting and you can go through the whole campaign using only one(besides hammer of dawn)of them which is just a machine gun with a chainsaw on it.The online co-op is fun, but the online matchmaking, gameplay and maps don't even campare to Halo. I've been through Halo and Halo2 about 15 times and I'm still not tired of it. If you already have a 360 then it's probably a worthwile game to get, but I bought the 360 just from the reviews of this game and I'm a little disappointed (not by the 360)because I was going to wait until Halo3 came out to buy it."
5,A Fantastic Third-person Shooter,"This game is indeed well made. The graphics are amazing as it takes advantage of the Xbox 360's powerful processors. The sound is also good. Moreover, the soundtrack/score for the game adds a lot more excitement to the already excellent gameplay.Gameplay is very good. Engaging the enemy usually necessitates the use of cover. The enemy seems to know how to pin you down (possibly a good AI engine).This product is rated M so it may not be suitable for young children. There's a number of cussing dialogs in the game."
2,SUCKS......REALLY,"THIS GAME I HAVE PLAYED MANY TIMES OVER AT MY BUDDIES.HERES WHATS GOOD--> GRAPHICSHERES WHAT SUCKS--->STORY,CONTROLS,WEAPONRY (IF YOU WANT REAL WEAPONS PLAY RESISTANCE: FALL OF MAN), ENEMIES (PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME), CHARACTERES ARE ANNOYING AND STIFF MOVING, SHORT CAMPAIGN, TEAM MATES ALWAYS DYING, AND ANTI-CLIMATIC ENDING.REALLY THIS IS JUST A SYNOPSIS BUT THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH $60."
5,Video Game On Steroids,"I have played Gears Of War One. Overall, I enjoy the game, but what I don't like is how all the characters look as if they're all on steriods. I think the characters are just way toobig. The graphics and art is amazing in this game. However, I do feel that the imagery is just too gothic, that it's just ridiculous. The artwork, protective gear, and weapensall appear to be over the top, but not in a good way! It seems to me that the game developers got carried way with all the gothic artwork. I really feel the game developersshould cut back on the gothic artwork just a little.Last but not least, the game is extremely fun. It's probably one of the most creative games ever designed."
2,Reviews gave me high expectations... :(,I heard so much about this game but I don't see what people like in it. There might be some nice pre-game videos but the game play is slow and repetitive. You're this slow moving character that mows down ghastly creatures with your never-ending-ammo machine gun. That's it folks. It's a remake of the old computer game Doom. But some people will pay $60 for that. It's all about taste.The online game play is just as slow.And what's up with you being able to revive your teammates but they can't revive you?Ian
4,Looks sounds and plays amazingly.,"This game has it all, looks great, plays very well, sounds great and is all around fun. With the Co-op mode you'll have hours of fun ahead.I have been playing this for a while, and one of the things I enjoy most is that it's not boringly easy. There are some pretty darn hard parts, which makes for great entertainment.The only thing that is lacking, is a longer story. On hardcore, with about 10-12 hours of play, this game can be beaten. Being able to play the other side of the story would be nice, or adding more story is one of the only things that would let me rate it 5 stars over all. The game is immensely fun."
2,Smh,Received The Item And It Didn't Work Couldn't Even Play It Once I Only Gave The Game 2 Stars Except Of 1 Because Of The Hype I Heard About It And Was Looking Forward To Playing It. Get It If You Want But I Advise You To Get A Properly Clean One To Play.
2,resistance fall of man is better,i think this game doesnt come close to resistance fall of man because gears messes up on you and resistance doesnt. dont get me wrong this game is really fun but just to short. resistance also has better graphics its twice as long and 3x harder then gears of war. and i dont really like this game overall if it was longer and harder and didnt mess up on you i would give it a 5.
1,no memory thing?????,i just got mine and couldn't even use it bc it was missing some memory thing??? i thought they all just used the ps2 memory card??? my code breaker one did and it always work perfectly... this sucks if anyone knows a way to get the memory thing for this game shark for cheep please help me out...
4,Here's a Wonderful Tool for....,Here's a wonderful tool for you to help yourself and especially help others as they beckon for help. Truly insightful and worth it to have within one's arsenal in carrying out the 'helping' practice. Thank you so much Carolyn. Take care and be well.......
4,Easy to Use,"The Taylor K-2006 is awesome but it's no toy. I use it about once per week. Takes less than 15 minutes to test free and combined chlorine, pH, total alkalinity, calcium hardness and CYA levels in the pool. I'm better able to manage water quality in my pool and save a little money because I was over-treating in the past."
3,review,"This kit performs all the necessary reading, a little difficult for beginners and I think you can buy a cheaper test kit and get the same results."
5,Better Than Strips - You Can Find it Cheaper,"After strips from two different companies (Aquachek & Leisure Time) were giving me dramatically different results than having the pool company test my water (read cyanuric acid as low when it was high, read ph as high when it was low), I switched to testing with the Taylor kit (based on recommendation of pool company).The results are closer to the pool company rather than my strips.Found it for $15 less on ebay."
1,Thank goodness I only rented it,"This is just a bunch of movie clips of Jackie Chan (mostly from ""Young Master"" and ""Twin Dragons""), and then some of Bruce Lee. There really isn't any biographical information, or anything on either star. (They could have at least shown the scene from Fist of Fury where Lee snaps young stunt-man Chan's neck!) The only, only reason to even rent this is for the interview of Bruce Lee at the very end, which was pretty interesting."
2,the art of felt making,"I am really sorry ( as i hate not giving good reviews) but i found this book far too simple and childish in its finished felt. Now having said this, I CAN see a use for it in schools. The ideas were most suited to young children i thought. A good weekend/holiday craft book for the children to have some fun and keep out of mums hair. lol"
1,bad toy,This falls apart all the time .My daughter gets so upset the wings come off and they are too hard for her to put them back on herself.
1,Not so hot,I tried listening to this a while back but couldn't finish. The vocals are amateurish and unpolished. The lyrics are superficial and generic. I would recommend skipping it.
3,"A catalog, not reference book","The title is correct, it is indeed a catalog and not a historical book with model descriptions.Positives:- Very complete- Quality printing- Small but good descriptionsNegatives:- Too few descriptive images, no images of details or features- Confusing, difficult to identify models- Not user friendlyRecommended but could have been more user friendly!"
5,a great reference book,a great book at a great price................... saved $$$$ and got a great product first day I had it I used it for reference
3,fine,Its not as detailed as I needed it to be but still holds vast amounts of knowledge the Smith owner looking for some history.
5,Idaho,"I read other reviews before purchasing this movie and I agree that this is one of the best acting movies of Roy Rogers. In 1992 I missed getting to meet Roy by 10 minutes, always regretted this."
1,creationist; remarkably biased,"Nice reenactment sequences and photography, but these are the only merits of the film. I wonder if the scientists interviewed approved of the edited snippets of their conversations on The Origin, since, as a Paleontologist who has not only read the book but practised in the field, I can hardly imagine any able Biologist himself/herself so characterizing the work. It is likely that the interviewed scientists are selectively quoted, w/ malicious bias."
1,Ripped-off by Creationist group,Like others have said it is a propaganda DVD made by creationists nothing more. I paid $24 for this piece of trash. I was ripped-off by producers who failed to mention (on the Australian issue) that it was made by a religious group. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS RUBBISH!!!!
3,Fame is a Damn Shame,"I almost put this book down. It did start off slow. For some characters, he told their whole story, it kinda got on my nerves, but as you read on you'll see why he told you all of that information. Takeisha(T-Love) was the leader of this all girl gangsta rap group. Latrell(Luscious)was a real no heart, hood chic. Danita(D-Boogie) was the mellow one out of the group. She didn't sleep around. Now Takeisha and Latrell both got dudes for their money, but Latrell was the h**. Scar is Takeisha's ex boyfriend/rapper, who some what makes it in the rap game. He puts the girl on the map, until Takeshia catches him cheating, pours hot water on him and her beats her. Of course they break up. This little scenerio has the book taking turns. The girls become famous, but what happens? I reccommend this book. I read it in a day."
4,Good basic meter,"I do industrial maintenance and have found this to be a serviceable little meter. I was looking for something with reasonable accuracy, reliability and price that would fit in my small tool bag and this has filled the bill for a few years now. Shop around for it though. I'm an amateur radio operator and I bought mine new in a blister pack at a hamfest ( a flea market for hams.) for $14. After buying it I priced it on eBay and found it for between $15 - $75. That was over a year ago though."
1,WATCH SEPTEMBER CLUES,"I used to praise this DVD untill I found out their discussion group wont allow ANY no plane theories to be discussed and will boot you out for even mentioning September Clues, which is a free download."
5,Best 9/11 Documentary to date,"Loose change 2nd edition was good however was a good film, however it did contain some errors and missing citations. Loose Change Final Cut was remastered and very well Documented. The DVD is unprotected for a reason, Make Copies! The producers of this film are 100% ok with you giving copies of this film away for free. Spread the truth, help those still suffering.infowars.comwearechange.orgae911truth.org"
1,Hey Dylan...,"How bout I give you two bucks. You could use it to buy a rat to chew that growth off your lip. Seriously, what a moron. I think the truthers and the teabaggers ought to get together."
2,Very Biased,"I was hoping for an even-handed book on the death penalty. Unfortunately this was not it. Eevery defendent is either innocent or railroaded according to the authors. The offenders were made out to be wonderful guys who simply had a bad day. They were either innocent or didn't get a fair trial....the usual liberal arguments. I had little sympathy for the convicts ""counting down the time""The victims got no mercy and neither should these guys."
5,High fule saving and small performance gain,"My 2008 Chevy avalanche was doing 530 KM if I drove normally, however using K&N; filter I am doing 520 KM while I am driving agressivly all the time, or 590 KM if I drove normally.Performance wise I didn't gain a lot, since the weather is hot here and Iam currently running the factory tune."
4,replacement air filter,My husband was told about this filter so I bought him one for my car. It makes a little difference in gas mileage but the best thing you don't have to change it at all. So far we like it.
4,good buy and lasting investment.,I purchased this item for around $20 on a special and glad I did. I'm not out changing air filters all the time and this one seems to have given me about 1/2 mpg better efficiency in my civic. I can't comment on HP because I don't really feel an increase.
4,A must-read for all fans of science fiction,"Tiptree employs lyrical, gorgeous prose throughout this novel of destruction and rebirth. There are telepathy and psychic phenomena, alien body-snatching and parental love, youthful energy and the exhaustion of old age. So many themes resonate throughout this gorgeously written, ambitiously imagined, and perfectly realized novel. A must-read for all fans of science fiction."
4,Impeccable!,The best shoe grease on earth! Keep you leather boots as new with Huberds. Will buy again and again - Thank you
3,Very nice chair but...,"We purchased this chair after seeing so many tacky looking booster chairs in cheap plastic that looked difficult to clean and were very pleased with the design. The problem we do have with it is that there are many chairs where the back is too high for the seat to fit properly so one has to adjust it with a large book on the bottom to raise it. That said, it is still a nice chair but the design could use more improvement."
1,Very poor quality,"I bought 2 scarves for Christmas presents. I received them yesterday and I returned them today. Very cheap looking, some fabric imperfections on both scarves, poorly cut edges and as one reveiwer said, appears felt-like. I would be embarassed to give these as gifts."
4,Cashmere Scarf review,My son wanted a cashmere scarf that we had seen for $85.00 for his birthday - that was out of the question so when I searched and found this scarf at such a reasonable price I was thrilled. The scarf arrived in record time and my son was delighted with his birthday present!!
4,Cashmere Wool Plaid Scarf,"The scarf that I received is a beautiful color and the fabric is very soft as I had hoped. My only disappointment is that the sides of the scarf are not hemmed and the ends between the fringe are not finished in any way. For this reason, I probably will not order another scarf from this company."
3,Cashmere scarf,"The scarf is beautifully made, but the color which was supposed to be Cardinal Red was more Orange. Thus I sent it back."
4,Scarf,"Could have been a little softer, fit's my need perfectly. Venetian Red is awsome color. Would buy more for gifts."
3,There are better translations available,"What I don't understand is why this translation is IN PRINT, while some really excellent translations of the Inner Chapters of the Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu), such as those by A.C. Graham and Victor Mair, are OUT OF PRINT."
3,Suspense,"I really thought this was a good movie, a little off the cuff and full of suspense. Check it out - not a porno - a drama about a house where people go to live their wildest dreams. One day a guy's wife goes there - not gonna tell you what happens next!"
5,"OMG, black truffle heaven!","This stuff is what it is all about! The tiniest pinch makes almost everything taste better. My kids don't like it as it is too strong of a flavor but that means more for me. It is one of my chef's secret go to seasonings. Just use 1/4 as much as you think you might need. People love this stuff, it's like CRACK! In fact, one of my friends nicknamed a potato dish I make with this ""Crack Potatoes""!!! I would give this stuff 6 stars if I could!!! I use it all the time and this jar lasted me over a year. Well worth it."
4,Easy Listening,Really nice arrangements of some great country classics.Good change of pace from todays country music. Relax and enjoy.
3,"Cute Stuffed Toy, however,,,,","My 3 year old loves the Barbie Fairytopia movie. She laughs everytime Bibble says something. Well she loves this toy and takes it everywhere. She even takes it to bed with her. y only issue with it is that it does not stay closed with the velcro where the batter pack and on/off switch is. So it is kind of annoying when the bottom opens and the plastic pack is showing.But overall, it is cute."
4,Doggone fantastic!,This is a great video series for children who are also interested in reading or who would like to explore books suggested by Wishbone. A fantastic gift also.
2,HP SHOULD BE ASHAMED,"Is it just HP printers or all printers that have that tendency to jam. The color is good,rather noisy but acceptable.For some reason or other this printer will not accept good photo printing paper,it jams everytime."
1,Broken,Arrived broken. Amazon said they were no longer carrying the item and have informed me that they would make a refund for the order.
1,Very Sad Fiction from an Angry Liberal,I feel sorry for Bob Woodward. Seems he can't let go of the glory years. This is such a slanted and biased account it would be laughable if it weren't so sad. Bob and those like him are fading into the sunset and it's hard for them to accept. Don't waste you time with this one.
5,Great Book,The product arrived as described and provides an insight into what Bush really intends to do.
4,All Americans should read this,"Wow! This book has all sorts of juicy nuggets in it. I think any American should read this and get a better view on all of the complicated reasons that we went to war. From reading this book, you get the sense that going to war was pretty much inevitable, and that a lot more was involved than the president just thinking about what was good for the country. After going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 even more of the connections between Bush and the Saudis became clear.As always, Woodward seems to get a balanced perspective from a number of different viewpoints."
4,Foreigner's opinion,"Author tries to present very detailed report how the decision to invade Iraq and preparations of the war developed. We got day by day relation what happened in highest offices in Washington. Certainly this report is objective and impartial, the facts presented are true and the sequence of events is correct. But something is missing, probably the national and global context. Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld are shown as the only figures wanting to go to war, while the forces in US and abroad pushing them are mentioned very marginally. This book is a good source for another book writen by some historian in the future about reasons and outcome of the war in Iraq."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Perhaps in time as I delve further into this book it will be able to make more connections, and gleen information. Seems somewhat vacant in its presentation from the title and from other similar books read on this subject matter."
2,Thinly Veiled Christian Rhetoric,"Was so excited at the premise of this book, but could not stomach it after a couple of chapters (VERY rare for me). A pro-life, Christian agenda slithers beneath the surface. Very irresponsible, opinionated ""journalism""."
3,HACKED UP AUDIO,"The audio/video on this show is very choppy, great hd quality but you can tell the show has some songs cut out, also sometimes the crowd noise sounds added to the mix,but it is six feet under, and indeed it is brutal, i liked the pyro spots, wished bringer of blood had been included, still worth buying."
1,Excrement!,"This is a great tool for anger management. Aside from that, it has no use. I find it extremely frustrating that the programmers at Williams forgot about something known as the laws of physics. Essentially, this software finds every possible way to screw you over. It loves to make the ball curl just right so that it's a straight shot between the two flippers, or into the holes on the sides. It also seems like sometimes the ball has a mind of its own, or is magnetically attracted to certain objects. Luck is really the best predictor of success with these games. It's a waste of money to buy this, especially if you're easily frustrated."
2,there are better pinball games out there,if you like pinball game try visual pin mame you can download it for free and then you can load any machine you want on it all you need are the game roms. here is the link http://www.vpforums.com/vptables/tables.php#Files
3,Works as described: Strong and durable.,"These are good condoms that do the job. Strong and durable. They fit snug, and there's never any feeling they are coming loose.I do prefer the Pleasuremax; the Extra Sensitive don't seem to have less sensitivity. So, if you want to extend your sessions, then use these condoms. :)"
1,Riped in 2 setups,I put the tent up for the second time and the slots riped where the poles go in. So I would say this is a horrible tent.
2,out-of-date,"One should expect that an important achievement such as the journey of voyager I and II through the planets would bring unvaluable data and reveal exciting images from other planets. However it was rather disapointingly to watch a great scientific event through pale images in the age of digital video and poor data information in the turning of the century. If you wish to have an up-to-date news about our solar system and see astonishing images I would recomend ""The Planets"" produced by BBC."
5,A Magnificent Tribute to Planet Earth,"In 1990 national and international award winning director Don Barrett (Patrick Stewart narrates The Planets, From Here to Infinity, The Voyager Odyssey, Nine Worlds, et al.) was commissioned to create a musical video tribute to Planet Earth. The footage was shot on all seven continents and includes special sequences photographed on the Serengetti Plain, in the Amazon Jungle, Weddell Coast of Antartica, Alaska, Over the Himalayas. Fantastic musical score in full Dolby Digital Surround makes this video and experience to keep in your collection."
5,"The ""black album"" of the Indie world","tHis album captures Karate's sound at the cusp of thier musical evolution. The mellow-to-vigorous bedtime rockin' that trademarks their earlier work embraces the jazzy riffs and emotive atmospheres that the band has mastered on recent releases, creating a surreal musical experience in each of the nine songs that the album has to offer.sMooth bass lines, subtle-yet-solid drumming, and calculating guitar blend together through an onslaught of musical ideas, each one experimental and each one working.Farina's freewritten lyrics conjure up sublime imagery and seem to mean something different every time you hear them, and his trademark beat-poet style of delivery only adds yet another facet to the flood of originality recorded onto this disc.bUy it and enjoy!"
3,interesting but ...,"An interesting read which could have benefited from theattention of a diligent editor. Sadly, historical detailsare often muddled and in the later chapters the authorindulges in some freewheeling speculation regarding highenergy physics while quoting undergraduate level journalsas sources.Nevertheless, all of the subject matter and most of thetext is well worth a look."
2,not so bright,"i wish these would have been brighter then they were, you can hardly tell they are on and they are about equal to the stock lights."
4,Not bad,Not a bad book! I bought a bunch of poetry and this actually turned out to be good. It is about a relationship that starts out beautiful with some neat images and goes really bad. We have all been there! It takes us down a scary road and turns around. I liked it.
4,Good,"Good book. Emotional, pretty images, deep feelings, romance, sex, it has everything. Start to finish it is one long story, so it reads like a novel more than a collection of poetry. I recommend this book to everyone."
5,My Daughter's Favorite Book!,"My wife reads this to my daughter every night before she goes to sleep, and she loves it! It's the perfect length and it allows my wife to get animated with my daughter. If you're thinking about buying a book for one of your kids, this is a great book to buy."
4,Wonderful Rhyming,"I grew up with Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb and it was one of my favorite books. I'm glad to see that it is still a classic and that a lot of people enjoy it also. It has a great beat and repetion that encourage learning in younger children. It's a great way to get children involved in reading and making it fun."
4,Very Cute but Too Short,"Someone gave me the baby board book version of Hand Hand Fingers Thumb when my son was born. I enjoyed reading it to him, because of its rollicking rhythms, its entertaining and random rhymes, and the eternally happy monkeys! I always wondered what the full version was like, so I finally got it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed, as it only has a couple of pages that the baby version lacks. I wish I had checked it out at a bookstore before I bought it! Still, it's a great book for any age!"
4,good condition,"Received in good condition and timely, but I didn't look closely enough, I was wanting hard cover and this is a board book. Still love the story."
3,It's an OK DVD,It's an OK DVD. It's not my favorite. Don't expect to see AZZIA in the costume she is wearing on the cover.
4,Doll house for Christmas,"First of all, I have to say that I ordered this late for Christmas and it was predicted I would receive it on Jan 4th. Instead the product was here in 4 days a week before Christmas, with normal shipping. I was really excited to get it.We decided to put it together Christmas Eve for the big Christmas reveal. Big mistake! 2 1/2 hours later with frustration and sweat, it was finally together. I'm not sure if it was due to lack of sleep or bad instructions but it was not going together easily.Christmas morning, my daughter was in love! She was so excited. It is a great house and is definitely gigantic (hope you have a big spot to put it). I'm glad I got this house versus one made out of plastic, I just wish it had come with furniture."
1,Bigggest Brother,"Too many innacurate facts. I recommend ""Beyond Band of Brothers"" by the man himself, Dick Winters. I don't think he totally approved of ""Biggest Brother""."
1,This is NOT collection five for season 3 (3.5)!!!,This DVD has incorrect information listed on the website. It is not a double DVD with the listed episodes. It is a single DVD with two episodes: Relativity and Incubator.
3,Needs to Do More Research,"While Mr. Leonard may have a good handle on the diving in and around Guam, he hasn't taken the time to research all of his findings. In his book he stated that the local military ""rarely contributes to the local economy"". Absurd. As a member of that military i know for a FACT that we are a vital part of the economy on Guam. We shop in off base, we LIVE off base, we eat off base, we PLAY off base. IF you can make a statement that blatantly incorrect, then what else in the book was ""inaccurate""?"
1,Get a life!,The author of this ridiculous book obviously has no sense...not to mention no class. For him to lump every single member of a fine university into one category truly tells a story. Tell me Mr. Finebaum. Did a good looking girl at Ole Miss turn you down? I have many friends who attended Ole Miss and that school has turned out many a good person. Get a life!
2,Not an actual book.,"Two stars for content. I felt a little cheated when I opened the box and there was a mini-booklet instead of an actual book. If I would have been aware of the size of this, I would have made a different John G. Lake selection."
3,"superhuman, but boring?","Certainly his fingerwork is of superhuman. Any extremely difficult passagework does not sound labored and dutiful. His perception of complicated texture is amazingly clear to listners. Probably his performance of ""Don Juan Fantasie"" is the most accomplished one ever recorded. But something emotional is lacking, I feel."
2,The Goddess Workout:Intro to Bellydance,I was disappointed in this CD. The camera work was poor and the content was not that good. At best a two and a half stars product.
4,Fun book!,"This is a great book for reading in those spare moments. For me, it was not the sort of book I'd read in one or two sittings -- just a chapter here and a chapter there while waiting in a doctor's office, or sitting at the Barber shop, or reading a quick chapter before bed.It is not intellectually challenging -- it's not meant to be. It is an enjoyable, easy to read book that is filled with interesting, little-known facts."
3,Wanting More,I enjoyed reading through the stories in this short book but was still left without any ideas for my own proposal.I'd recommend the site howtoproposemarriage. com -- the ideas were much better.
4,Signs of the Times,"A good list of things to be aware of in this day and age, as we are waiting for the Second Coming."
3,works but not easy,"The setup of this unit is very difficult. The on screen display is difficult to see. flickers all the time on a newer tv, had to dig out an old CRT tv to be able to see setup menu."
4,"Works okay, video so-so, tiny split files are annoying","Concur with the other reviewers as to the benefits of this DVR unit. I've had mine for about six months and used it 4-5 times. Always use the highest video resolution at around 12 fps. Video is acceptable but the MAJOR pain is that it splits the recorded video into MULTIPLE files which have to be JOINED using a 3RD PARTY utility to make one COMPLETE video recording. All because the engineers who designed this DVR didn't want to implement streaming media codecs in the firmware. Seriously, I've got another cheap $40.00 mini-DVR that will stream the video in the form of a single .AVI file to removable media (SD card). Good news is there are free utilities that will join the multiple .AVI files this unit creates relatively quickly, just an extra step which, IMO would not be necessary if the firmware had been designed to do streaming video.Overall, good product, does what it is supposed to do, one star off for the multiple files issue."
2,buy another guide :-(,"This garden book fails in many ways. As an illustrated guide, it fails miserably. The pictures are small, blurry, sometimes over-exposed and most are not representative of the subject. Worse is the fact that most plants are not even illustrated! You are left wondering what a plant really looks like. I have had to research most of the plants mentioned via internet or leafing through other books.Another fault is the hardiness zones of some plants are incorrect. The authors need to redo this information. My particular pet peeve is the mention of plant pathogens-- they give a list of plant ailments, but do not tell you how to prevent, or treat it.I gave it only two stars because of all these faults. It is an expensive book, but definitely not worth the price. Look elsewhere."
5,BUY IT NOW!!!,IF UR INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHY I SHOULD THAT EXERCISE OR IN WHICH WAY -THAT UR TRAINER CANT REALLY ANSWER YOU SOMETIMES- THIS IS THE BOOK. THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THEORIES IN THIS BOOK CAN BE CONFUSING IN ORDER FOR U TO MAKE AN EXERCISE PLAN TO USE IN GYM OR UR DIET PLAN.
4,Excellent,Great movie. Kept my interest. Sometimes movies this old will seem boring to our modern short attention spans but I never fast forwarded. Loren is great. He's great too.
4,No one was prettier than Sophia!,"A very entertaining film, the first teaming of the 3, as you most likely know. And Sophia. Oh my! So beautiful at such an early age! They just ran this on TCM, great print, so you know the DVD will look good as well. Was shocked to see a very brief nipple slip, as she was changing behind a bush while on the beach....if she had stopped one foot sooner, she wouldn't have shown anything! thank goodness she went just a little further! :)"
1,Really Only 60 Per Bottle,"I love this product, but beware- even though this page says the price is for a bottle of 120 pills, once it's in your cart it will have turned into a bottle of 60."
1,Not as pictured,i got the vise and it is all black. it is not as the one pictured on Amazon.it is wrapped and i will let my hubby decide whether to return it.
2,Not a good buy,"I purchased this tent for my 12-year-old son for his troop camping trips. After the first campout, he had broken poles. He used it in March (his 3rd camping trip with this tent) and the screen mesh ripped around the door. Now I have to purchase another tent for him in the fall when scouts resume. Do not recommend this tent unless you are extremely careful."
4,Easy set-up,"We purchased this tent just before our weeklong camping trip. The tent is built great and goes up easily. I do wish I bought a larger tent as it was a bit small for my 6'1"" husband and our full size air mattress. Thank goodness it didn't rain or it definitely would have leaked because of us touching the sides. But it's a great tent for the price."
3,Good Product - but faulty Zipper on D shaped Door,"The tent worked fine even in light rain, but the main zipper on the D shaped door would not zip at the curved part of the door. There are 3 zippers on the door - but the one to open the door to access the tent was faulty. I used WD-40 on the zipper, but it did not help. It would bind so badly I was afraid I would rip the tent attempting to open and close the Zipper."
4,very convenient for a single body,I went to Allegeny park in pa last year with this product and wasvery good to stay in for a while
5,Clues From Killers,I couldnt put this book down once we received it in the mail. Its a great book for anyone who wants to study the mind of killers. Thanks for bringing such a great book to us serious readers out here!!sandy- from Iowa
3,Mislead.,"The book is great, but the dust jacket was missing a chunk which I don't think meets the standard ""very good condition"" as was claimed."
5,"What, No Musicians??? ....Wrong !","Let me start off by saying that every one I gave this CD to last year,loves this CD so much that I'm back to pick up a few more for some new co-workers this year.That being said,the Grinch claiming that no musicians were used in this album is either delusional or has never actually owned this CD. The CD text clearly states the various instruments used on the CD: Colorful Piano, Flute,Percussion and lush synthesizer samples accented by holiday bells, placed in lively uplifting arrangements. Even if you can't read,you can definitely hear it. So I guess the ghost of Christmas past must be playing these instruments? Don't let anyone discourage you from purchasing this awesome CD. Definitely listen to the samples and if you like them, then it's a no brainer.Note: The audio quality of the samples here are horrible, The CD is much better!"
2,Bestor is better.,"My expectations for this CD were unrealistically elevated by the reviews on Amazon. The choice of songs was unimaginative, and the percussion was so repetetive, I felt like I could have done it on my electric piano by pushing a single button. Some of the harmonies also gave me the electric piano feeling.We Utahn's are spoiled to have the opportunity of attending a Kurt Bestor concert every year. Try his Christmas Vol. 1 CD and listen to his extraordinary, emotive piano and intrumentals. His CD's are less expensive and better than Mehdi, in my opinion."
3,Bulky and Awkward,"I see that a new bundle of three books of the Trilogy is available. I wish I had waited. This paperback is so bulky and cumbersome that I actually cut it into separate pieces - something I never do. The spine would have broken when it fell out of my hand just before sleep anyway. The other reviews in this section cover many of the literary issues, but I'll just say that I enjoy the stories. It is important to not jump into these new after seeing the movies expecting a close similarity - the movies are a very loose adaptation of the original stories. Nevertheless, it is great escapist bedtime or hammock reading."
4,Provocative and Useful,"Although not everybody would agree with the authors, the book is provocative enough to offer food for thought to the serious scholar of the Western occult tradition. The not-so-serious reader will still be entertained."
5,Cozy Country House Mystery,"If you enjoy M.C. Beaton, you will probably like C.S. Challinor's ""Murder on the Moor,"" another cozy mystery that takes place in the Scottish Highlands, at Rex Graves' (Scottish barrister-sleuth) retreat.Murder on the Moor (A Rex Graves Mystery)"
4,All that glitters . . .,"This is really a good book in most ways. The articles are very informative and well illustrated. I did enjoy reading it.The reason for only 4 stars is the major flaw in the book, the omission of the Egypt and the Niagara. Why did Mr. Pickford omit these two ships? Their stories are famous epics of salvage of gold: the Egypt in the 1920's and the Niagara during WWII."
5,An Outstanding Publication,"I have been a subscriber to BAR off and on (mostly on) for about 25 years. This is an outstanding publication! It is written by scholars (for the most part; at least most of the writers are extremely well-informed in biblical archaeology) for non-scholars (like myself). However, some of the articles can get very deep and many average Bible students may be intimidated by this. The only thing that I can think of that even comes close to being a complaint against the publication is that it seems to be biased toward a minimalist approach to the Bible (i.e., that very little of the Bible records actual historical events). It is hard to fault BAR for this, however, because most scholars in the field today are minimalist."
2,Very Flimsy,"It is functional as a lunch box. And I love the pirate logo. But it's very small. as in, you can barely fit a sandwich standing up in it. Also, it's incredibly thin and flimsy. Even gripping it firmly will cause it to bend. I don't expect it to live through the year."
3,Early Lollo,"For those interested in Gina Lollobrigida's early career, WIFE FOR A NIGHT is well-worth having. The film is not on a par with great works such as PAGLIACCI, FAN FAN LA TULIPE or BEAUTIES OF THE NIGHT, but it is pleasant enough. The DVD has good image and sound. It is in Italian with English subtitles. I only think it should cost half the price for which it is being sold."
1,Wife For A Night,"This Movie Is In Italian And I Couldn't Understand A Word Of The Dialog. Further, Upon Re-reviewing The Dialog Used To Describe The Movie, The Customer Is Not Warned That "" Wife For A Night"" Is Not In English. I Threw The Movie In The Trash."
1,You can find better.,This book covers only the basics. Phots were not verified well there is even a photo labeled as Bruce Lee but it's actually another actor. There are many more good books out there.
3,Functional with few features.,"We purchased this for 4 day car trip, it was a life saver. Only issues occurred when players sat in hot sun and video started skipping. We cooled the players down and they work fine. We are making sun visors to protect the players. We have not had any problems with video quality or sound volume. Most of the time we only used the audio from one player.Pros:- Reads DVD-R, CD-R, CD-RW etc. Burn video files as a data disc and they will play. Files must be MPEG1, MPEG2, or DVD format. I fit 4 full movies onto one DVD!- 9"" sreen has decent resolution.- 2 remotesCons:- Plastic feels cheap- No AC adapters- Only one player accepts video input- Composite video ONLY- Poor compatibility w/ file formats- Cheap carrying bagGiven the price I was disappointed by the lack of features. They are functional enough, and 9"" screens are not cheap for any model. If I were to do it over I would find a single player w/ lots of features (compatibility, video inputs, etc) and just buy two of them!"
4,Factually excellent,"Since the end of WWII the term ""holocaust"" has been used exclusively to apply to one specific holocaust in history. Thus the title of this book may cause some outrage. However, what can't be denied is that the text contained within is truthful. Even BEFORE the creation of the state of ""Israel"" in 1948, the ""Israeli people"" have been waging a war of genocide against the Palestinian people. This book details it accurately and should be read by anyone who wants to know the truth of the matter. (...)"
5,beware amazon customer service,ThIS PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED OK BUT BEWARE IF YOU MIGHT HAVE TO USE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY SPEAK POOR ENGLISH AND CANT BE UNDERSTOOD. THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU WITH ANY PRODUCT PROBLEM!
2,Big title - less content,"Although this book contains 27 house plans, in my opinion only a very small percentage of these are innovative enough to warrant publishing. The most exciting being the design by Earth Rammed Works which could have easily taken over the whole book and I wished it had.! Some of the designs used new energy saving materials such as photovoltaics, but these were not given explanation space and left the reader feeling quite frustrated."
3,"Imaginative, but unsubstantiated bio","This was an interesting, well-thought out, personal biography of Jesus. HOWEVER, Mr. Chilton does not really attempt to explain why we should believe his choices in ""filling in the blanks"" of Jesus' history. Why should be believe his vision of Jesus' vision of the ""Chariot"" ? Why should we believe that Jesus was trying to fulfill the prophesies of Zechariah? His explanations of the Tranfiguration, and of the Resurrection appearances are unconvincing. The reader is asked to accept too much based on faith in the author. This was ultimately an unsatisfying read. (His book on Rabbi Paul was easier to digest and believe.)"
5,"Wonderful, eye-opening",I enjoyed this book immensely. Jesus came alive for me as a real person in the context of his time and his community. The author has the unique skills needed to accurately interpret the life and times of Jesus as recorded in the original language as well as to identify where the original intent was distorted in later interpretations. There are insights provided here not to be found anywhere else.
1,returned purchase,"Recently purchased based on reviews. Received it promptly. Packaged well. However, not in the original box - they were re-using other kit boxes to ship because it was ""greener"" they told me. The booklet contained in the kit was 3 years dated and covered in stains, as if it had been subjected to moisture for a long period of time. Maybe there isn't a newer book, but its condition for the price was not acceptable. They were gracious enough to take a return on the product, but honestly it looked to be old and/or pieced together from partial kits. There was actually no way to call and talk with anyone, so I returned it. I was not impressed."
4,Great Book for VB.NET and ASP.NET,"I have been a Visual Basic 6.0 developer for the last two years and decided to upgrade my skills to .NET I found this book very helpful and full of valuable examples and tutorials. The basics of .NET environment are explained well in detail before the actual programming is started and that leaves quite a bit of margin for the readers to fully understand the environment before wetting their hands with code. Topics such as ADO.NET and ASP.NET are also explained in detail. To my surprise this time there is a complete new topic for Crystal Reports and its features, which makes the book an all in one resource. I would recommend this book to all the beginners and skilled VB developers as well. Thanks !!"
3,"Interesting, but could have been better","I enjoyed the book throughly, but some of the arguments presented could have been more convincing and better researched. It seemes as if Shmuelly took bits and pieces of his other books and put them together as a ""best of"" compendium.My Suggestion: Rewrite it, it really has potential."
3,Chick book for dog lovers,"Very enjoyable read for a leisurely afternoon. Not earthshaking in content, but my guess is that it wasn't intended to be so. Smiled often while reading this book, with my dog (not a pug) curled up beside me."
2,didn't go anywhere,"Pug Hill is the kind of book that never really takes off. It doesn't go anywhere. In the beginning we learn that the main character Hope is really unhappy with her life. By the end of the book nothing much has changed. I bought this book because it was a popular read at my Pug group and I alot of us had the same complaints. The slow pace, the lack of a good and developed story, and the main characters inability to make changes in her life. The story is about pugs but the main character does not own a pug which was pointless to the plot. Why did she not have a pug if she loved pugs? Why did she not have a dog at all? How can you have a book about dogs when the main character doesn't own a dog? It is one of the many questions this book raises with no answer."
2,"Beyond the Down Low: Sex, Lies and Denial in Black America",Wasn't very informative most of the info I'd already heard or know. It wasn't a easy read but it had tons of facts and opinion's.
2,Disappointing Taste and Texture,"Little cheese flavor, little pretzel flavor and crunch, greasy texture. Not really a snack, because it doesn't satisfy that urge."
5,beethoven.,"i listened this play 30yeas ago.and i wanted to hear this play on cd.i seached this .at last i found this.the play is good,and quolity is good,too.thank you."
2,Directions woud've been nice,"I have a one and a half year old boy so I live in a world full of velcro straps, snaps and buckles. I've gotten quite adept at figuring most of these snap, strap, buckle things out. Like ""Ghost"" I got this for my wife and like ""Ghost"" she is petite. We struggled getting the strap through the ipod case and struggled again when we tried to get it on her arm. This is too simple an object to be so difficult. I'm sure there is something better out there. We did get it to fit eventually, but if you're like me, you hate giving a gift that causes frustration."
3,Just your basic arm band.,"Honestly there is nothing special I can say about this arm band. It works, it holds the iPhone well and its adjustable. I decided after owning this one that I really dont like the cloth stretchy arm bands as when you sweat they soak it up and its kinda gross."
3,OK Product,"This product was generally what I expected - something to hold my iPod mini while I run. Would I buy another one? Probably not. Here are my reasons:1. I am a runner, so I have really thin arms, so this product is too large for me. I had to wrap the band all the way around, on top of my iPod, and to the other side for it to stay in place.2. On the back of the clear carrying case, there is a silver knob that I guess would be used if you attached the lanyard; however, this digs into your arm when you are using the armband. While it isn't causing me severe pain, it is definitely annoying.3. The band keeps my iPod on my arm; howevever, it definitely jiggles a bunch while I am running. I don't think my iPod is going to fall off; however, I don't imagine the product lasting more than a year.4. The product just generally isn't that comfortable. Other running bands are plusher, using softer cotton against your skin. This product is coarse."
4,Excellent product,Very nice sports strap for the iPod Mini. Works great on long runs and is very durable.
3,Difficult to use,"My boyfriend and I are working through the first lessons still. I took a year of Italian in college, and otherwise have a couple of years of instruction in French and Spanish, and my boyfriend did Spanish in high school. We had to figure out a way to work through the lessons ourselves. There's no real guidance.The worst part that I found, however, is that the first lesson itself has a bunch of colloquial language usage (conversational)... Which is great if you already know what reflexive verbs are and can logically accept that something is a nonstandard usage.I think we also identified a few translation errors to English or typos in the Italian itself. Again, if you can wrap your head around this and move on, that's great.I'm giving this three stars because the two of us combined have managed to make this worthwhile. However, I think if the two of us weren't working together, we both would have given up already."
5,An enjoyable book that will leave you wondering!,"This is a well written account about ghosts in the Big Sur area. It tells of a ghost plane that goes under Bixby, Ghost wagon at Mal Paso, and a lot of other interesting stories. A must buy!"
4,Planning a Foodservice from Scratch,Kazarian has written the classic text for designing any type of foodservice establishment. Examples of different types of foodservice production areas are included. Does not go into detail on purchasing equipment. I have used it to plan foodservices and as a textbook.
2,Last's Anatomy,"This title is essentially an abridged textbook of anatomy. The narrative is excellent. However, the diagrams pale in comparison to to other texts, let alone other atlases. The surgical exposure sections are without accompanying figures and are too brief. Radiologic studies are critically absent! Bottom line - I returned mine"
1,USE THE TIME FOR SOMETHING ELSE,"I was & still am a big fan of Simon & Simon but this book was definitely a waste of time. The writing at times was haphazard in thought and tedious. The recollections of what happened to Jameson Parker after the shooting should have been one book or an article in a magazine...While this other story of evolving into a range-roving cowboy and it's adventures should be separate. Jameson, might have grown into a good Rancher for a new career by now. Although as an Author, he will never supersede his previous day job as Actor."
1,Loud and useless,"Bionaire is the worst company to buy a filter from. If they don't do it right away, then you're lucky, but eventually they will begin to buzz at almost any speed. They also seem to do nothing about the dust or smell in the air.Customer service is the worst part about Bionaire products. They have two centers and if you talk to one one day chances are you will not get the same one the next. So if you fax in a copy of a receipt and call for confirmation, then you have to hope to get the same service center otherwise you will have to try calling again because they cannot transfer you or tell you anything about what is going on in the other center. Slow horrible service."
5,Excellent,"This is a surprisingly good cookbook, I love to cook and everything I have made using it has turned out well. Very fun for Friends fans, and has a nice variety of simple recipes."
1,Never received the item,"Even though its been a long while since i ordered, at that time i ordered many products at amazon at the same time. After a while i had forgotten about most of them and didn't have internet connection at the time to check on my orders. Today i verify my amazon account and realized i NEVER received some products even though they were paid for. This was one of them. I'm totally dissapointed."
2,Complicated and overpriced,"I bought this model because I was curious about ceramic tiles and wet to dry styling techniques. I set the temperature (as per the instructions) but it did not straighten dry hair well, so I raised the temperature which works better but also causes more heat damage. So I have been reluctant to try it on wet hair. It does however make hair strands shiny and that is a plus. I am going back to my Hot Tools flat iron (model #1190) which I have used for six years because it's a great product."
1,Horrible,"This is a horrible straightener. It frizzed my hair and dried my ends. Don't buy. But the ghd, it's worth the money."
5,Not the Usual Crowley Book,"You may not agree with the supposition that the OTO is an elite ranking of Freemasonry, though several 32 degree Masons I know of are Crowleyites. I don't suspect that many military or governmental freemasons go to practice sodomy sex magick after drinking with their buddies at National Sojourners' gatherings.That said, Craig Heimbichner's book is well-sourced and has a great amount of intriguing information not found elsewhere, both in scare books by Fundamentalist Xtians and hagiographies by Thelemites.Well worth a read!"
3,Speculative with a pro Roman Catholic Bias!,"The book is a good read but the author does not back up many of his assertions with solidly researched evidence. Neither does he point the reader to a conclusion or recommended course of action. He also is obviously pro Roman Catholic in his treatment at times defending the man-made traditions of liturgy created by that tainted form of Christianity. He did hit the nail on the head when pointing out a subject that many protestant Christians want to avoid, namely the large number of Freemasons that are members of the mainstream churches in America."
4,Great story... different story from where it used tobe,"Watching this title was something new for me, you will find a different story..unusual from what you had seen before. the love.. and the affairs.seems that marriage couple after many years they had lives along wont get along too, even if they think they had meet the only one, but turns out it isnt what you looking for. Your love are still out there and you need to come into making some part of mistaken in life which makes you become the miserable person in world.. but at the end you found that love and you will have to make decision whether you are going to fight for it or give up?great actors... love them and the characters.love to watch their performance , especially Rani.also theis music.. love it love it..."
5,KABHI ALVIDA NAA KEHNA,"AWESOME FILM EXCELLENT STARCAST STARINIG AMITABH BACHCHAN, SHAH RUKH KHAN, ABHISHEK BUCHCHAN, RANI MUKHERJI,PRIETY ZINTA KIRON KHER, ARJUN RAMPAL, AND KAJOL SPECIAL. GREAT SONGS MITWA MY FAVORITE. EVERY KARAN JOHAR AND SHAH RUKH KHAN FILMS ARE AWESOME."
1,Ick.,"I had the unfortunate pleasure of having a student ask me to read this book. I was hoping for a modern, updated, yet relevant book that was less flighty and more realistic, yet set for beginners. I was disappointed! Not only is this NOT a book I would recommend for anyone just starting their path, but there are things said in this book that are pure bunk, and in some cases, outright lies. Where on earth did the authors get their information, I wonder?"
1,used book from a library,"disappointed because the book was thin and was written for kids. didnt know that, there was no preview or at least it wasnt in my face so bought this book by mistake. also this was a used book from a library"
4,Not great but a good and a true book,"Too many characters in too short a book leave the reader wishing for more depth -- the book jumps from mother Josie to the two older daughters, Cam and Lila, and never focuses on third daughter Evie at all -- but the story rings TRUE. As an Army brat (I even spent a good part of the summer of 1963 in Beaufort, SC, where the story is set), I can hear the truth in every line of dialogue between Josie and her war-hero husband, Bear. It's much more a story of a military family than it is of a Southern family, for all of the local color, but it's well worth a first, second, or even third read."
4,"Again, very frustrated.","I had to rate this item, even not reading it - so on previous merit gave it 4 stars from having read and enjoyed her previous book Florabama Ladies' Auxiliary and Sewing Circle ... hardcover, not in Kindle at $11.99. I would love to read this book. Again disappointed, it's $12.99. Unfortunately, it is, along with many others, priced out of reading it. The only way I can protest the Kindle outrageous pricing is to not buy any book over $9.99."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. It's a quick read and got better as I got farther into it. Josie is a captivating heroine. She's had an interesting and sometimes difficult life as a military wife -- her husband reminded me of a Pat Conroy character -- but she hasn't allowed life to beat her down. But my favorite character is Cam, her oldest daughter. I loved their relationship and the way it developed and changed in the book, and I also enjoyed the prickly relationship between Cam and Lila. Battle writes character-driven books about the kinds of people we all know. I'm looking forward to reading more of her work. RECOMMENDED."
4,Bed and Breakfast by Lois Battle,I enjoyed the book!! It was my first book read by author Lois Battle. I shall look for more of her.
1,You've Got to Be Kidding,"I love The Big Valley, and was thrilled to be able to buy Season One on DVD. But if they're going to be selling the rest of the seasons as Volume 1 and Volume 2, they can forget it. They're essentially doubling the price. Also, with most everyone's shelf space at a premium, the last thing anyone needs is two boxes per season."
3,3 STARS AT BEST. HE DOES LOOK REALLY GREAT FOR HIS AGE AND THE BAND IS GOOD.,"Maybe I should have gotten something he did earlier. This was mediocre at best. AND, I did not like the way it was filmed. I have seen him live, so I know he is talented. This is definitely not it."
3,"Good DVD, Too Bad About The Songs","This is a great performance DVD that captures a single show from Bowie and his band prior to his run in with heart trouble. For the most part it's a first-class presentation and and engaging performance. The big problem? The songs. It's true Bowie has a massive collection to choose from, but why do I find myself pining for a dose of ""Diamond Dogs"" or ""Let's Dance"" or even one day perhaps ""Golden Years"" over some of his more recent pedestrian work. It's a nice package, but for me it's a one-time event and I'll probably never watch it again."
1,"Bowie goes ""slowie""","Terminally boring. Starts with some energy given to ""Rebel Rebel"" and then quickly dies in a sea of pseudo-emotional drivel with occasional instrumental interludes that try, unsuccessfully, to get some life into the performance. Evidence of the tepid tone of this performance is indicated by the limited audience response to most of the songs. Bowie should stick with his hits and save us having to hear his ""poetry"", which lacks punch and tends toward over production of what is aruably nothing more than commercial filler."
4,Bowie at his Best,Not sure the production aesthetic is holding up to time. Too much grunge effect and low quality filming. But Bowie's performance along with outstanding band far outshines. Stellar show.
3,Not as Good as JLC,"I was priviliged to see David bring his Reality tour to London, Ontario. What a great night of classics and new music. Pristine sound and great selection of songs, but some of the good ones missing from this dvd, including disco favourites ""lets dance"" and ""china girl"", also ""suffragette city"" and more recently ""Iggy"".The lighting on the dvd just did not match up to the live show and DB's humour just didn't come through. He is really a fun guy!Don't get me wrong it is still a great dvd of Davids songs from the past 30 years, just not as good as being there on the night!!"
4,A very good performance.,"This is a high quality disc and, with Junghanel's solo CDs presently hard to get hold of, this is as good a presentation of his fine playing as you can find. Weiss and Junghanel admirers will need no further encouragement.However, for those new to Weiss, Barto's series on Naxos might be a better introduction. His performances are also very good and the budget price is extremely attractive. You can buy three volumes of Barto's Weiss for little more than the price of the single Junghanel. All are equally enjoyable discs."
5,"The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination","I have alot of a books on Tarot cards but this is the one that has helped me to understand the them like never before. After reading this book I am now reading my other Tarot books with a greater knowledge of the cards.This book takes you back in time and to places laid out in rich symbolism which seems to magicaly bring the cards to life.The auther Robert M. Place takes you with him to meet the artists of the cards and you almost feel as if you are there with them while they were being painted/drawing.I highly recoment this book for beginers and the learned alike, even writers will find this book helpful to stimulate the imagination.So take a journy with Robert Place through time and space, it will change the way you look at Tarot cards for ever."
1,not what i thought,said it was silver should have known for the price but i bought it and it turned my neck green and color on necklace began peeling off maybe good for costume jewelry i was hoping for more
4,Dinotopia,My son had to have this movie after seeing the trailer on another video. It was worth getting since the characters are fun and it has an easy story to follow. He enjoys watching this one over and over.
4,Great Reference for Places to Visit,"We're currently living in London for four months with a four year old, and we use this book just about everyday. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it's not great for restaurants or hotels, but is well worth buying just for the comprehensive list of places to visit that kids would enjoy. We found this book much more helpful than others that we purchased. Most other books have too much information and list too many places to visit. This one just listed the major sights to see, but includes some of the lesser known places. We love it, but we're also more interested in taking our child to the National Gallery to see Michaelangelo and to the Natural History Museum to see the dinosaurs, then we are in taking our child to Legoland. (And yes four year old children can appreciate Michaelangelo if you explain it to them!)"
5,A gorgeous retrospective of a brilliant body of work,"This intelligent and lavishly illustrated volume, which first appeared in a 1989 hardcover edition, covers Pollock's entire career, his early influences, and the progression of the themes, techniques, and accomplishments of his life as an artist. Ellen Landau's text is enlightening, but the best part of this book is, inevitably, the illustrations themselves, which are an unparalleled feast for the eyes. For those who want to experience and understand Pollock's art (rather than dwell on his personal problems) this is an excellent choice."
3,good purchase,"not a bad price and fast shipping. the book looked a little sun damaged but since i only got one, i couldn't tell."
3,Good for younger kids,Reader Rabbit keeps them interested when they are very little. They still like the programs in 2nd grade but not as much as when they were younger. The characters apeal to younger children. Still anything that helps is good.
1,Absolutely Horrible,This book is a sordid collection of junk. I picked it out at random from a library shelf and did not enjoy/like/sympathize with even one thing about it. Don't waste your time.
3,It traveled with us but...,"Two friends who drove cross country recommended a book like this. I was pleased with the very prompt delivery. But I found it very difficult to follow, first as we drove the northern route from California to Niagara Falls to Massachusetts, then on the return southern route from Boston back to CA. We ultimately just relied on the AAA Tour Books for each state, Trip Tiks, and their recommendations for restaurants and sightseeing hints."
4,"Dahlin', Jerry is telling it for True.","I grew up in New Orleans and spent a lot of time in the Quarter eating ""Lucky Dogs"" aka Bourbon Street Steaks. The characters are not exaggerations. From the shake down cops, to the vendors from Mars, Jerry is tellin' it for true. A visit with these characters is a great way to pass a good time."
3,Exactly what it looks like,"Bought this on recommendation of my wife after a conversation about terribly made yet endearing films. This movie is so early 90s B movie it just screams nostalgia, also the ending is wonderfully disturbing."
5,Enchanting,"It's brilliant! My English Professor first brought these books to my attention, and this book captivated me! I must admit I thought it was a little predictable, but otherwise the story is wonderful, especially the calm voice, neat writing, and clean pictures of Eumphemia next to Angelica's often irritated tone, sloppy and ink dotted writing, and erm, interesting pressings. The two balance each other out perfectly, and the ending left me wanting more! I did read it out of order (I have not received the first one) but I am very excited too!I was told, however, these were children's books, and they almost appear as such. This book is not, however. But it's still awesome."
2,Not for small face kids,I tried to like these goggles because of all the good reviews. I bought them for my now 5-year-old son to use in his swimming class. After two months of use I decieded to write this review. I give them two stars. They are too big for his face. They slipped off so easily even I tried to tighten them. I don't recommend these for small kids. They also fog up alot. Pros: They are easy to adjust. The windows are large so the child has a large field of view.
3,Cannot seal anymore,"it is very easy to adjust, and sealed pretty well for the first 3 weeks. And now my son start complaining."
2,For 6 yo girl,She hated these. Didn't fit well. Leaked. A big disappointment. On to find another pair.Had to include another few words
5,Comfy,I got these goggles for myself because I have a small face and reglar goggles refuse to seal. These are very comfortable and easy to adjust.
1,BAD SELLER...!! pesima broma- la imagen NO corresponde al nombre del articulo,"BAD SELLER...!!All Sales 55004P Polished Billet Aluminum Third Brake Light Cover - Oval Cutoutyo he comprado este articulo(PICTURE) para mi suv FORD SPOR TRAC 2007, pero al llegar! me llego OTRO!!! como tiene el titulo solo es un covertor de luz ........... califico como pesimo vendedor.. ademas Me cuesta mucho dinero regresar este articulo."
4,A good start,"This book is a great grammatically guide to W. Armenian. Although it lacks in the ""fun"" that language textbooks tend to offer, it's the best out there for Armenian."
5,Great Gloves - my son loves them!!!,Everything was great with this product - my son was so excited! He takes them everywhere with him!
5,Crystal Clear,"I feel like i am in the movie when i listen to them and the bass is solid and the highs and mids are perfect. Sounds like one o those 3,000 dollar bose systems"
3,Wish they put Side B on another disc,"Always love the hardy Boys. Even my 7 year old daughter loves watching the episodes. The only thing is that the Side B doesn't show sometimes on the DVD player. So, it might be better to put all the Side B into another disc instead of the back."
5,Classic Mystery Series,"Sorry to say that the main reason I liked this TV Series was because of Shaun Cassidy. Story lines were interesting and exciting, but being a fan of the Partridges, it was only natural that their real lives would enter into other areas. This happened with The Hardy Boys. Not trying to take away Shaun's talents because he is an extremely talented man - both in front and behind the cameras. If you like mysteries you won't be sorry in getting this series.Patty, Clmnt., NH"
3,"too many ""dud"" episodes","Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew (1977-1979) {ABC} 67 eps The books of the 60s, turned into 70s tv series, clean cut comedy adventure, Shaun Cassidy & Parker Stevenson as The Hardy Boys hammed it up too much, but Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy Drew made it a little more believable. Also William Shallert & David Knell (later Bret Maverick The Lazy Ace).season 2, 6 good and 4 great episodes out of 22. The other 12 eps are ""duds"".season 2 disc 3 ep 10 introduced the NEW George (Susan Buckner) and disc 5 ep 21 the NEW Nancy Drew, the more viewable Janet Louise Johnson.Season 3 NEVER shown on TV here and with season 3 NOT released yet on dvd, who knows which Nancy Drew and George will return!"
4,Good for mix it up time,"I have pre-schoolers. 10 minutes is just enough time to get something going without being crazy sore or anything. This is not strenuous, you won't ""feel the burn"" unless you are a true couch potato. But for people who have to live their lives post-workout, it's great. I'll do a section if I'm tempted to skip a day, because you can at least do the 10 minute total body to keep in the habit. Gillies is a NYC studio instructor who knows her stuff and has a dedicated student for demonstrating the modifications."
4,"Ancient History, Well Written","For too many, history is dry and unreadable. This is even more the case for ancient history. However, the author, Harold Lamb is able to do what most writers and historians cannot do--make ancient history not only understandable but interesting. In this book, the author presents a history of one of the greatest military leaders of all time, Hannibal. Hannibal commanded the Carthaginian armies in the Punic Wars between the Romans and Carthaginians. He was successful against the Romans for many years when others were not and with a smaller force. Hannibal used offense as the best defense and was a master tactician and strategist. This book is especially well done in that it attempts to fairly portray Hannibal even though history has almost no sources other than those told from the Roman perspective. This is a short and concise history of Hannibal and is well worth reading, especially for fans of history."
3,It's ok for the money..,"I KNOW about sound systems.. trust me and Altec Lansing AVS500 is a good speaker for average person with limited budget.Only the basic controls are provided: volume, surround level, subwoofer level, on/off switch, and a switch to select Stereo (two-channel) or Gaming. There are no tone controls (most important option to me)!! I didn't like the satellites lack of rubber feet of any sort, so they kept sliding around my desk and computer. Highs were zippy, although emphasized in such a way that cymbals became overbearing and strings too strident. It did have nice Bass and gave you a descent sense of ""surround sound."" BUT.. It's easy to setup that even your gramama can do it.It came with my computer (upgraded) but I rather choose monsoon or JBL or higher end of altec lansing.. but it's only my personal opinion. Average joe (like everyone here) would like it enough."
1,unsatisfied,"Didn't work as promised. Couldn't even get the pieces to bond. Followed all instructions, but the product hardened even before I applied it. I wouldn't recommend it. I just wasted my money!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I agree with the above review. I had a front tooth that came out of the socket. You can make up to 3 repairs with the kit. I had to use all three. The first two repairs only lasted for about 3 meals, and the last one only lasted about 2 1/2 days."
2,I never believed my roommate got this set,"I had a chance to test this set along with Yamaha YST-M201 in store, imo, I prefer Yamaha (Y), because the overall audio Y is very good, deep with no boomy bass, and my happy past experience I had with Y 3-pieces seton the other side, when I test this set, I don't believe this is Altec Lansing!!! what the hell happened???! mid and treble are okay, the problem is bass, it is hard to adjust and boomy, it's over emphasized around 150-200Hz, but very WEAK around 50-70Hzone more thing I am surprised is my ex-roommate purchased the set, he may like this, but I am sure I don't like it at all, it's not natural as past AL"
2,A challenge,This book needs some work if it's going to be useful to anyone just beginning Greek. I gave up after about 5 lessons...and I'm fairly adept at learning languages.
5,makes me feel smart,good book with alot of information. good if you are looking into racing or just have an interest in the sport
5,Excellent Witness To The Early Church' Belief Concerning This Eucharistic Teaching !,"Excellent book on the Teaching of the Early Church concerning what Christians actually believed concerning the ""Eucharist"" or ""Lord's Supper"" or what was soon after called ""The Mass""... (Prolly within 300 years of Early Christianity). Highly Recommend it !!! There are no loose ends in this book. Mr. Aqualina does a stellar job simply putting forth the basis in quotations of what the Patrisitc Teaching of The early Christians from the time of the Apostles really believed in this topic. And one cannot leave this reading without a clear and concise conclusion. The Eucharist is Jesus Christ. Period. Exclamation Point! Read it for yourself. The quotes are only 2000 years old.. ;-)"
3,Too much of a fairy tale,Well the book started off well but as it got toward the end it started to be to good to be true. I would recommened the book but just to let them know that it is like a fairy tale
2,HORRIBLE,"I'm highly disappointed, it's her worst book! Very boring and couldn't hold my attention. I would consider checking to see if it's at your local branch library before purchasing this book!"
2,SHAME ON IT ALL,"Shame on it all. I am very disappointed in this book. I have read all of Zane's other books and this last one does not even measure up. It lacked her creavitive thought and humor, that she is known for in her other books. It also lacked her exotic flare and romance compared to her other books. I feel the author did not but her all into. I hope these reviews are taken seriously by the author and we as reader do not have to see a repeat of this book. On this note, I look forward for the future books ahead and I hope there is a change for the better and not the worse."
2,shame on it all!!,"I have read every one of Zane's book from beginning to end and was greatly anticipating heat seekers from all the other books she had written I just knew this book would have me bound to a chair fiercely reading until there was nothing left. Imagine my surprise when I went to the mall and purchased (at a much higher price then amazon!!) this book to be so greatly disappointed with it!!Shame on it all left me longing for more of the sister hood they had, Addicted left me thinkful for committed relationships and the Sex Chronicles left me (well you know). Sorry to say Heat Seekers had no heat, no major passion, and no major story line. This clearly was not Zanes best nor was it her average. I will continue to view her stories but something was greatly missing with this one."
2,Decent poker chips.,If you need alot of poker chips at a cheap price. This is the way to go. The center is a sticker and already have a couple stickers fall off. The case is pretty cheap.
3,OK Chips,"The chips are acceptable for the price.Pros:1) Price. And the set works well for home games.2) Lots of extra stuff: 4 decks of cards, dealer button, lots of other buttons, key chains, etc.Cons:1) The case is pretty flimsy; I doubt it will last very long.2) A high percentage of the chips (probably 30% or so) have off-centered stickers, which are easily peeled off (not from normal use, however).3) When you first open the set, the chips are covered in black powdery stuff.All in all, a good deal for the price, but I'm not going to make gifts of this product."
2,Jeff Gordon: One of NASCAR's most manufactured stars,"This book is just another in a long series of Jeff Gordon propaganda. This book is regurgitation of mass media hype concerning one of NASCAR most manufactured ""stars."" There is nothing new in this book that we haven't rolled our eyes over in previous books. The author is clearly looking to cash-in, riding the coat tails of Jeff Gordon.If you've read previous autobiographies of Jeff Gordon, don't bother with this one. There's not much new in this book you can't find on any NASCAR Internet message board or newsgroup, and you don't have to pay for it."
5,Just the Bear facts,"Awesome dvd,a real life bear hunting dvd that shows it like it is.Billy's ability to catch pure adreneline rush of bear hunting is fantastic.Awesome scenery and pure hunting at it's best.I would recomend this dvd to everyone.Makes me want to plan my Alaska trip today!"
1,"Clear Writing, Heh","This book is touted as linking ""us to the timeless wisdom of the ages."" Its wisdom is about the equivalent of a cow patty splatting on a flat rock. Seriously, it's highly academic and seems to me designed to be read by phd types who are researching a thesis. Anyway, I couldn't finish it. I wanted how-to and got endless ""erudite"" discussion of well, something like the old theme of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. But no methodology for ""doing"" anything but sputter.Robert"
4,Sweet and sexy love story,"This is a great movie to explore the splendors of young love. The dialog and plot are simple, but there are provocative scenes the story is sweet and there are a few funny parts. I enjoyed this movie... similar to a Korean ""Lie with Me"" with a little less depth/moodiness and a twist with a love triangle."
2,not impressed,"I used to buy a 50pack of envelopes from Walgreens for about five bucks. the envelopes were fine, worked well enough and as a bit more sturdy than these. These are super thin, and do not seem like they'd offer a lot of protection. My recommendation is to skip these and find the thicker color envelopes maxell puts out."
5,Beautiful and poetic,"Listening to this music I am transported to another world. The songs are like looking at a beautiful painting where it reveals more of its character each time you look into the images. The layers of the songs, the melodies and the haunting sounds will stay with you long after the songs are over. If you like the soundtrack to The Mission you will love this cd, it touches the soul. Truly a good one, check it out..."
5,Deserved It's Oscar,"Tan Dun created a masterful score for this movie. Using a combination of traditional Chinese instruments, percussion and western orchestral instruments, the work sets a perfect tone for the highly mythic tale of love, honor and responsibility. Though this is not Tan Dun's most adventurous work (what film score really is?) it is an impressive film debut. Tan Dun should do more film work. The industry needs fine composers like this."
3,"Nice contents, ugly packaging.","As a book, it's rather ugly. The pages are obviously printed out by an inkjet printer or something (you can actually see some jaggies in the font), and the index is created by MSWord indexing menu, which has multiple entries of the same item, and the way he indexes whole phrases makes it very hard to look up.It's contents are extremely repetitive. You'll see the same ideas and examples expressed over and over and over and over again, in almost exact same wording. With proper editing, this book would have become 1/3 the volume that it is. The ideas are interesting, although some part, like his suggenstion that the US government should engage in industrial spying, seems questionable. Also, when he uses the word ""Open Source"", it's not the open source that the people in the software community is used to, so be careful. But it's a book worth skimming through."
2,Average.,"I have tried lots of natural hair washes and conditioners over the years, but none of them can really compare to the good chemical brands. They are really in two different classes. If I compare this product to other natural brands, I would say it is about average and nothing special. It leaves my hair heavy and tangled, not light, brushable and bouncy. I went back to Pantene and put this in the Kiss my Face in the guest bathroom.Comment Comment | Permalink"
3,Battery Life,It dies a lot faster than I expected but it works for what I need it for. Good battery overall.
1,Not a good battery,This battery will barely last 30 mins. Just like my first battery that came with the camera. DOn'T BUY IT!
5,Excellent.Her angelic voice & quality songs are superb.,"Profound lyrics, original music, the angelic voice of Puerto Rico's ""Doll of the Witchy Eyes"", Miss Nydia Caro and the sounds of the Island nature with South American and Puerto Rico's musical instruments make this cd a classic."
5,GREAT PRODUCT !,Did exactly what the label said kill fleas and there larva . My house and dogs are flea free! Fast shipping and half the price .
2,rapid???,Takes forever to charge. But it does keep it on but when you unplug you still are where u started.
3,"Bought two, one did not work","The price of this product is fabulous. My husband and I both have Lotus's so we bought two of these car chargers. Unfortunately one does not work. But, the price is so cheap it's not even worth trying to get a replacement product or my money back. All in all, I'm not even upset that one didn't work. That saying ""you get what you pay for"" was ringing in my ears the whole time I was making the purchase so I feel pretty good that one of them actually works."
5,A superb reference on landscape palms.,"A beautiful and extremely useful guide to the most common landscape palms of Florida, California, and Hawaii. The book is very well laid out and easy to navigate. Sharp color photos accompany the concise yet thorough text with one palm, or a very closely related group (Genus) of palms, described on each page. Planting and maintenance advice follows, with photographically documented information on diseases and nutritional deficiencies included. Reference lists at the end of the book cover a variety of subjects. Excellent!"
1,Promotes Overpopulation of Cats,"All the cats featured in this film are absolutely adorable, but the human characters are basically into breeding cats for profit. There are far more cats sent to shelters than there are people to adopt them. If you truly love cats, please rescue one from a shelter instead of buying one from a breeder or pet store."
5,Comfortable casual seat,"This is good as a casual seat in or out of the boat. I row out to Mokulua from Kailua and I bring this to sit on at the beach, at least your bum is not in the sand and you don't have to lug a towel.Very soft and comfortable, you can row for hours, as it provides the height off the boat's floor to get proper leverage to row with smooth, efficient strokes."
3,Vista Users Beware,"If you are looking for a classic game for a really good price, this is one. It takes place in World War 2, you get to shoot Nazi's and complete mission with historically accurate World War 2 gear. The graphics are dated, but the game it old. The missions are simple, but the enemies are super-human. They can spot you through fog and walls, but do not worry patch 1.3 will resolve that, the real kicker is that on Vista it will play up to level 3, but when you try to go to into level 3 the program crashes at the load screen. I have a feeling that it is relevant to Direct X, but I am not able to confirm it. Also update the game to patch 1.3 as soon as you get it because you will loose the ability to access saved games when you update from an old version."
4,LIfe -Span Development,The book is easy to read. The author does not assume that you have prior knowledge about development stages and theories that accompany the stages. The author also adds real life examples of how these stages may look in life in many different cultures. The chapters build on each other. The author does a great job of reveiwing key concepts from previous chapters as they relate to the current chapter.The CD had been helpful in taking the reading materials to the next level of understanding.
2,not as promised,"This book is in terrible condition. The package was torn open. The post office tried to keep it together, but it was in horrible shape. The book was bent, torn, and overall in terrible condition. This could have been prevented if you would just use a box to mail it in. The paper bag you used didn't work. So maybe next time you can put your books in a box and you'll have happier customers."
3,Decent bench for the price,"I was able to put this bench together in about an hour. For the price, this bench meets my needs for weight and versatility.Pros:- good value- versatility- Good size- Moderate weight capacity (not for power-lifting, IMO)Cons:- Not really 'Olympic' sized bars (provided with clamp on adapters)- Packaging was lacking (Some plastic parts were cracked, but cust. service replaced free of charge)- Missing three bolts/nuts and a couple of washers (easily found at hardware store)- Finish on 'chrome-type' metal peeled in some area and is sharp enough to cut.- Lat-pull down bar takes time to loosen up and move smoothly- Plastic handles for provided bars (pull down, preacher curl bar) hard to fit."
2,Disappointed,"The equipment arrived before Christmas which was great, however after opening the poor packing there were items that were damaged, some of the metal frames were bent and the seat was torn, there was visible damage to the packing showing multiple tears in the packing. We were not at home and the package was left so had no chance to report concealed damage. I figured to start assembly of the equipment but found the instructions not very clear and everything was in multiple plastic bags so you had no idea what went with what. After locating a number of items I started and it took quite a while, I ended up with a number of items that I had no clue where they went. Was able to straighten out some of the bends in the metal, so looks okay.Do I contact Phoenix direct for the replacement seat as I do not want a ripped seat. Not a happy camper at this point."
2,disappointed,"I heard Wind Me Up by the Backyard Band on Pandora and wanted to buy the single from this CD but was truly disappointed to find out that it's not on there. I love this hit and it's a good dance, booty shaking track to jam to when having a party but how can you advertise the song...or even list the song on an internet music site but not have it available to purchase."
4,Disappointed in Amazon,"I rated a 4 because I love the music, but I am HIGHLY disappointed in Amazon for offering an edited version of this classic and not even indicating that it is an edited version. I bought this double disk when it first came out and listened to it everyday. I had given it away to out of town family members who also loved it but had no way of getting it. When I saw it available on mp3 here I jumped on it only to find out that it has been chopped to pieces. This was a concert! One song flows to the next this version would make any real lover of go-go sick. At first I thought it may have been just the mp3 version but I read the same thing in the CD review. Amazon could have at least warned us that this has been edited."
4,Provocative. . . . .,"How surprising that the author of this provocative novel was only 19-years-old. How does a 19-year-old gain such experience, such insight, such maturity? Exceedingly well-written, intense, psychological, dark, lovely. The reader is captured, held hostage to the story."
1,there's better stuff out there,"I've always felt that Nick Waplingtons work is erratic and overrated. The book which follows up his Living Room project is the same. Its ok enough I suppose but doesn't have the heartbreak of Richard Billingham or Leigh Ledare for example. Mr Waplington is just making photographs, and that's not enough in this situation."
2,Watch It For Bela... I guess...,"Bela is a maniacal eurasian fella, out to destroy both europeans and asians in chinatown, in this 70 min. condensed version of the 15-part serial. Even at 70 minutes it's a chore to watch! Bela is his old self, but there's just not enough action or plot to really make things enjoyable. If you're just looking for a good Lugosi serial, I recommend THE PHANTOM CREEPS, as it's dumb but fun..."
5,vegan world fusion cuisine and so much more!,"This cookbook is the most treasured in my collection and I've reviewed many, many cookbooks! Not only is it full of some of the most delicious recipes but the whole world of being vegan and an atmosphere of peace and harmony are wrapped up in a beautifully done package with this one. The best I've seen ever! I would definitely recommend this cookbook for everyone. Vegan, or not.. the recipes and information are a valuable resource."
2,Greatly disappointed in this vegan cookbook!,"I ordered this cookbook after rave reviews from several of my friends here on O'ahu, but I was disappointed. Many of the recipes are bland and require too much preparation for my schedule. The book has a beautiful layout with many photographs and looks as though it was thoughtfully constructed, but the recipes were not tasty. This book's authors seem very passionate about the recipes, so I feel bad giving a low rating, but I did not like the recipes at all and can't recommend this book."
4,"Easy, delicious recipes...",I am new to veganism and found this book to be an excellent source of delicious recipes. They are easy to prepare and very tastey.
4,Great and easy to follow,very different and easy to follow. The recipes are creative and healthy. The ingredients are appropriate for a vegan diet
2,This is a bad one,"This was a poorly thought out game. There a numerous bugs, which have kept me from playing for more than a few minutes at a time. The company's tech support does not respond to e-mail, and judging by other reviews, I'm not the only one. The graphics are okay by mid 90's standards. The control interface is horrible. There are no patches. The gameplay itself seems okay, but it's not really worth the hassle. Buy something else, it will save you lots of frustration and show these game companies that they need to start producing quality products."
4,carrying case for camcorder,The bag is great ! The only issue was the shipping price. Cost just about as much as the bag itself...
3,"Lacks blood, guts","Beautiful chorus (though a little breathy with the sixteenth note runs here and there) and this is the richest, fullest period instrument orchestral sound I've ever heard.But where is the dance inherent to all of Bach's music? Not to be found here. Everything is, I think, too reverent (I suppose an emphasis on the divine but that completely loses the earthly aspect of Christ). The Cum Sancto Spiritu sounds like a fast dirge, the Crucifixus lacks a pulse (sounds like Palestrina badly performed). There is very little dynamic variation. It feels like Herreweghe drew one long legato line from the opening to the last bar.I will keep it in my collection (B minor mass obsessive that I am), but if you want raw life instead of classical trance, get Gardiner's recording, or better yet, find Rilling's 1999 recording - it is truly full of life (Ingeborg Danz will break your heart in the Agnus Dei, the Sanctus will rock your bones) and thus all the more transcendent."
3,Cape kid liked the book despite problems,"I thought that Schneider attacks this book with the best of intentions and scores on many points, specifically the history of the Naussets, Champlain's adventure on the Cape and early whaling ships (including the Essex). Where he failed was in the telling: too often he jumped from event to event in a disjointed history or re-related events in a clumsy narrative. Too skimpy to be history, too spotty to cover the entire Cape, I liked this book despite its problems because it gave me some great historical perspectives of the beaches and sea where I live."
1,This book is a bunch of garbage,"Well, well, great to see Mr. Bugliosi writing his opinion and arguing how he feels. What a load of baloney, boy has this man put out his partisan agenda or what! Gee, I wonder who he voted for?? Come on, tell us Vince. Bush won fair and square and you liberals know it and need to take a hike and get on with your grey poupon lives. You can not keep counting the ballots until you get the result you like. This was not Vegas pinball but the real deal. I thank God up in the heavens that Al Gore was not president on 9/11. We would still be trying to figure out a response to those lunatics while having someone like Pee-Wee Herman as Secretary of State. I am very grateful for having a strong and resolute leader in the White House!! Long live America!!!"
1,Vincent Bugliosi has brain made of junks,"This book is a waste of woods. The Supreme Court Undermined the Constitution and Chose Our President? I think Vincent Bugliosi loves to choose presidents through false ballots. He loves to play the guessing game. Oops, I just poked a hole here and here and here, but who did the voter choose? I shall psionically communicate with voters to determine their intention! Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No response, what shall I do? Mini-mani-no... Never mind, count it as gore's."
1,political pandering to make a buck.What's new?!,"Let's cut all the pretenses, please. If Gore had won the election the republicans would have been the ones screaming bloody murder. Since Bush won however, it is the democrats who are whining. This is merely politics as usual. (...) The election had to be brought to a close at some point.The arguments presented in this book don't prove anything except how arbitrary the laws and statutes of this lawyer infested country really are. (...) This book is a way to cash in on politics just as another book by a republican schill claims it was the democrats who tried to hijack the election. (...) Don't waste your time or $ on this garbage-unless of course you are a die hard democrat and want all your own rhetoric and prejudices and disappointment over your puppet losing the election justified. Be better than that."
5,rayjo@alltel.net,"I have just finished reading the book Betrayal Of America byMr. Buglioso. it is the best book I have ever read,and I have read hundreds if not thousands of book. (I do not like fiction)I don't know if Mr Buglioso has ever been in combat, but even if he hasn't he is still a HERO in my eyes for revealing the injustice which was perpetrated by the INFAMOUS FIVE[....]Thank you mr Buglioso for writting this book,and showing this country that our democratic process, is not as democratic as we are led to beleive. [....]Once again thank you Mr Buglioso for writting this book."
1,Betrayal of subjective writing,"The Betrayal of America is one more book seeking to profit over the attention of the recent Presidential election. The authors are unable to hide the political agenda and opportunism behind the book's writing. Keying in on the 5-4 Supreme court rulling because it makes good copy, the book avoids the initial Surpeme Court ruling of 7-2 in favor of Bush, which declared that the use of multiple standards for interpreting ballots was unconstitutional. The 5-4 vote was about whether the Court believed there was enough time to develop one standard and then conduct a final recount. Save your money and pass on this poorky written political drabble."
1,What a Joke,"What a crock! Lies, spin and plain [bad]. Bush won in spite of all of the [stuff] that Gore and his goons tried to pull..."
2,Well crafted flight of Fancy,"""The Betrayal of America"" is a fascinating, but fanciful volume of OPINION that makes for a fun read but must be taken with a grain of salt. In real life, Al Gore would have lost every recount despite the antics of the Supreme Court. The real ""Betrayal of America"" still needs to be written - the 8 year reign of crime perpetrated by President Clinton."
5,This book is not out of print,"This book is not out of print. It is readily available from the current publisher, Books on Demand in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The book has been praised as the best treatment of Augustine's Theory of Knowledge available. Chapter topics include an overview of Augustine's philosophical system, his treatment of skepticism, of faith and reason and an extensive examination of his often misunderstood theory of divine illumination."
4,"Very in-depth, not sure about following the exact plan","I see a great deal of value in this book. As a the new pastor of a once large church that has suffered greatly over the past twenty years it has really helped me think about how to move forward. I am not convinced that spending to much time in the past is a good idea, but then again it is thought provoking and worth the read. I am struggling, through prayer, how to use what I have found in these pages. You will need to be the judge on how you apply what is offered in the book, but again it will make you think. I do not want to suffer the same fate that pastors have at this church over the past two decades. So I am researching christian materials that might help me. So far, this one has at least helped me to think deeply about how our past does so influence our present. There is enough in these pages to warrant buying the book."
4,Great except for...,When I to it there was a few scratches on the front of the box but other than that it was great I like the other seasons better but that's just me i am still really happy I got it
4,Bounce Back After Baby,"I have been reading some 'not so good' reviews on this video - and so I had to add my own comments. I had a baby at 38 years of age. My older 2 are 13 and 18, so it was definately a big shock to my body and I gained way too much weight. I had been trying for a long time to lose the weight, and now 7 months after delivery, I have found that I am finally loosing the weight, thanks to this fantastic video. Yes, she does make a couple of mistakes, but if you do it often enough - like you should, you will be fine. This video really works in all the places it needs to after you have a baby. The moves are really easy and she makes it a lot of fun. I would recommend this to anyone!!!"
5,I love this workout,"I too cannot believe how many bad reviews this video received. This is a great workout, and of course at first it is going to be difficult. You need to practice and keep at it. I have been working out with Denise for a month and a half and I already see results. I love Denise's energy and the support that she gives you. I think she is awesome! I would definitely recommend this workout."
2,Not for everyone,I had a long and hard pregnancy that ended with a c-section. I was looking for a way to recover quickly and get into shape at the same time. This was not it. I didn't have enogh room to do a lot of the moves and I needed to start a little slower then jumping right into this kind of work out.I might enjoy this later but not right now.
1,You have to be a dancer...,"The ab work on this video was good but the aeorbic workout left me making up my own moves just to keep moving during the 20 minutes. Although I believe this tape would help people get into shape I am greatly disappointed in a few things:1. You had to be well coordinated and a dancer to be able to do the steps.2. Being that it is targeting post partum women, coordination and quickly moving from one thing to the next is not something that is easy. I felt that she did not target the 80% but only the 20%.In comparison to the video by Becky Cortez, this video left me wanting the basics instead of the cute dance steps. I will stick to Becky and Gin Miller videos to get me back in shape ."
1,The WORST!,"You should be very much into this aerobic thing, and I mean, that you should be a person who practices a lot of aerobics to follow the pace of the excercises.I am sorry but this is not for everyone, like they make you think when reading the publicity of the videos. It should work in women who are very familiar with aerobic excercise because if you CAN follow the routine you are going to lose weight and tone your body.I bought a rebounder and a video with rebound excercises and that's a marvelous excercise, and also have other benefits. The best of all is that this excersise makes you lose a lot of weight with NO pain at all. And I mean it!"
1,the Next Exit isn't eXitSource book,I purchased the Next Exit book thinking is was an update to the eXitSource book I have currently. I was disappointed. It does not follow the freeways through the states as eXitSource does. It is much easier to follow the Interstate than to locate each individual interstate while switching through the states. I also used the Next Exit while traveling through Utah and found that the exit numbers were incorrect and information was incomplete. I was very disappointed with the Next Exit. They should take a look at eXitSource and follow the format they use. It is much easier to follow eXit Source if you travel across the US as I do.
1,Bought Used For $6. We Are Still *VERY* Dissappointed!,"Like idiots, we gave this guy the benefit of the doubt and tried his book. WHAT A MISTAKE! After seeing most of the code not work and the direction of the topics going offtrack, my collegues and I would just not feel good about not warning others first. We've seen his temper get out of control in the MS newsgroups and I guess that should have been our warning to stay away from his work. There HAS to be a book out there better than this one because the developers here are now using this one for nothing more than a foot rest. Save your money!"
2,"Excellent Subject, Poor Presentation","With Michael Kaplan's contributions to other technical books by the likes of Paul Litwin and Ken Getz, I expected a bit more. It suffers from the lack of good, solid editing. He rambles over some points and glosses over others. I can only recommend it to people who already have a slightly better than basic understanding of the material. This isn't a book a novice or hobbyists could learn from without a great deal of effort. For them I would suggest waiting until someone else tackles the topic and does so a little more clearly and a lot more concisely."
5,A beautiful book - excellent wedding shower or anniverary gift,"This beautiful book has become my standard wedding shower gift. It's lovely, simple and genuine. It follows in the spirit and style of Costanzo's ""The Twelve Gifts of Birth"" and ""The Twelve Gifts of Healing."" I have all three on my bookshelf and will never part with them. I especially recommend all three books and look forward to Charlene Costanzo's other works."
5,The perfect gift,"This book is the perfect gift - for an historian studying the intellectual history of the ancient Near East from a Feminist point of view. The ""boring"" part of it is valid only when applied to people outside of the target audience. I was assigned this book in a history class, and read it with great delight cover to cover. I can understand where other people are coming form, but if you have a feminist Mesopotamian intellectual historian, this is THE book.I give it five stars, but only within it's microniche."
3,A good romance,Castle of Eagles shows both the romance and the events of the times in Vienna. This book does give you a some information about Austria but I really enjoyed the plot.
2,This is not a Furtwangler recording,"Music and Arts has dropped this recording and issued the actual Furtwangler / VPO / Badura-Skoda recording from 1952 on M&A CD-1097. The recording here has Badura-Skoda as one of the soloists, but the identities of the conductor, orchestra and second soloist are uncertain. The performance is actually pretty good, but not what it was thought to be."
1,Even worse than Vol. 1,"Unfortunately, I bought Vol 1 and Vol 2 of this 'Abba tribute' at the same time. Since these are all 'no name bands' I was hoping for an 'alternative approach' to these Abba classics. But to my disapointment, all these artists try to copy the original Abba sound and arrangement - and they fail horribly.I guess the good thing is, that this proves, how brilliant the guys in Abba were. These two CDs are absolutely unnecessary. They sound like your below-average hotel lounge band, trying to imitate the originals, using a $ 100.00 Casio keyboard and a midi drum computer.Buying these CDs, no matter at what price, is simply a waste of money !"
3,Very Good,"This album has a lot of good songs on it. Dame Un Kiss is a great song and probably the best one. The album is worth getting just for that. I thought the first half of the album was better than the second but overall it's worth adding to your collection. Better than average, I should have given it 4 stars."
5,Good Stuff,"Really Great Product!!!! Not a single scratch on the cd. Was expecting the worst especially since I paid $4 bucks for it, compared to $60 bucks on other websites. Thanks guys you did an awesome job !!!"
3,Computer help is no joke,"This is a great title, but seems to have fallen out of print. Written in 2000, it might have been out a little too early to help all the people who are overwhelmed by tech in every facet of life now in 2006. So many people need a little computer help now and then. As the author of ""Computer Ease"" I know there are many who need a little humor and hand-holding to get past all the tech jargon and really learn how to enjoy working with your computer.Helen Gallagher, authorComputer Ease"
3,Potential Lost,"The Chili Blues Band cd is ok but it could be a lot more. They mean well,but are not gritty enough to be a true blues band. The sound of the songs is too clean. You don't really get the blues feeling from them. This is not a cd to put on the ""rush out to buy"" list. Sorry Gordie, I had hoped I would like it better than I do."
2,"Pretty, but boring","This game is fun to look at, with several actual clips from the show and some nice graphics. But there's precious little exciting about it. You have to wait up to a minute for every section of the game to download, which is a huge drag. And even though you are able to fine-tune your relationships with the other players it makes little difference in the tribal council voting -- characters that you are supposed to have an alliance with will vote you off anyway. Plus, for some reason my cursor doesn't work during the survival and challenge periods, which makes it sort of difficult to play. But these aspects of the game are boring anyway, and the challenges are similar to simple kiddy video games. Buy this game only if you are dying of curiosity."
1,Why The Only Great Timmy Thomas Song Is Included in Mono version?...,"The only song this record is worth to get, TT's super 70s Hit ""Why Can't We Live Together"" is in Mono sound. It also includes an awful ""Disco-remixed"" version of the song. It is not worth the price!"
1,Not happy,I would like a refund for another Van Halen DVD release. This was terrible in the technical sense; poor video and audio.
4,Garmin support for the Mobile 20-,"Some of the problems I encountered were experienced by the other reviewers. Originally, it would not work in New York City but was just OK at home. My solution was to call Garmin support. The person I spoke with resolved all the issues over the phone in a through and professional manner. It works really well, in fact, much better than the Street Pilot I own and almost as well as the GPS in my car. I requested the free map update online -and it was delivered by USPS in about a week.This review, if rating only the Garmin support, would have been 5 stars."
1,Did not work on AT&T 8525,"This product was supposed to be compatable with my AT&T 8525 phone but was not. The data card included was an SD and not a micro SD as needed by the phone. The customer service person at Garmin was completely unhelpful, especially when she found out that the product was purchased from Amazon and not directly from them. This is not the usual experience I have when buying a Garmin product."
2,not so great,I rented this dvd with hopes it was better than the reviews. It is a shame this dvd is being sold under the Last banner. Have found better in the one dollar bin.
1,Product great but expired product shipped,"This product is great, but I have had 2 shipments in the last 2 weeks and both products came expired from 2006. Amazon was great at sending me another shipment, but the replacment shipment had the same expired date on it. ** Check the expiration date before opening **Amazon was to resolved this and take it out of inventory until they could address this issue."
3,Wrong order,No fault of their own but I ordered the wrong cartridge and didn't realize it until i installed one of the 3 and didn't work. Unfortunately could not return them or exchange for correct ones since they were not in stock.
4,THE BEST GROUP FROM THE '80'S,"I recently picked this cd up in Virgin records and it is wonderful. I'm not crazy about every song, ""Black Comedy"" sounds too much like ""Spice Up Your Life"" from the Spice Girls for my tastes. But when it is good, it is great. ""Cold Shoulder"", ""Strange Voodoo"", ""Fat Cat"", ""I Just Wanna Be Loved"", and more rank among the bands best work. Since this came out in 1999, and their website is not updated I really doubt we'll hear anything new from them anytime soon. I'll just have to listen to this and my old CC albums."
5,Culture Club back better than ever,Culture Club is definetly back with this new album Don't Mind If I Do.The songs are catchy and you'll find yourself humming them in no time.If you liked Colour By Numbers you'll love DMIID!
5,Excellent Spiritual Exercise,I have now used this book three times for the introduction to spiritual exercises. This is a great book for long term group daily meditations (possibly the best). I am currently leading 2 separate groups using this book for spiritual development.
1,Not Happy!,I ordered this product along with several other similar products from other companies at the same time. I received all of the other products from the other companies but I never received anything from this one. I emailed the company (Rocky Mountain Soap Factory) directly thru Amazon and did not receive a response.
5,Foo-get-about-it... This album's a killer,"Beautiful melodies, dynamic drumming, bouncing bass, sincere heartfelt vocals, crashing and pounding guitars, great production work... another excellent album"
5,better and better every time,"This cd is a little better than ""the color and the shape."" The songs in it are a lot more catchy and it is easy to tell that they really worked on this one. The music video is also on the cd, which I thought was pretty cool. Go buy this bad boy. you won't reget it."
4,radio-friendly but doesn't stink,"Great tunes! Foo Fighters can produce radio-friendly songs like ""Learn to Fly"" that aren't garbage, and nothing wrong with that, says I. Let's not slam talent just cuz the alternative punk is a little popy, come on :). And somebody please shoot me for using all these ""genre"" words. Good music should just be called ""good music"", period!p.s. that breath mint video or the one for Learn to Fly are hilarious. I love it when a band has a sense of humor.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"
4,Pure rock,"Rocking from the start, Foo Fighters just go all out on this one. Not being a hard core fan I was impressed by the energy and the power this band puts forth. Each song has a driving beat that can be exhausting sometimes, but I admire their willingness to return again and again to the primal force of rock. Talented and tuneful, Foo Fighters provide the listner with straight ahead rock and roll; a commodity that is getting harder to find all the time."
4,Learn To Fly...and more...,"""Learn To Fly"" is simply superb, the best song on this track. (The video, included on the ECD, is fantastic as well, I laugh every time I see it). Other songs on the album, such as ""Aurora"" and ""Breakout"" are good as well, and should keep this album popular for some time. It is a pleasant listen, with a few standout tracks. Even this pop fan likes it...<evil grin>...Some of their songs are gritty and tough, but my favorite moments are when they are laughing. Even though I don't like their stance on HIV, this album is good..."
1,Terrible,"Dave, you're a drummer, live with it. Louise Post is right about you. Go buy ""Resolver"" by Veruca Salt and see what a real band should sound like."
5,A Great CD,"Dave Grohl has always been one of my favorite musicians. He's funny, doesn't take himself to seriously, and can really rock out. These atributes can not only be said about Grohl himself, they also apply to his band. This CD is a great rock CD and is one you can surely listen to over and over again."
4,Nice.,"I've listened to the disc over and over. As a huge foo fan, I had to get it within the first hours of release. Their first disc was a masterpiece. I say this ranks second. It takes time to grow on you but it's a good buy. The first six songs are excellent. ""Stacked Actors"" sets the stage with its intense catchy smooth and semi-crunchy riffs accompanied with those subtle double harmonics which gets you hooked to listen to it over and over. Great performers and a recommended buy. A very cool band. Go for it!"
2,What a letdown!,"I anticipated this release for months. The Foos, I thought, would give a nice injection of rock and roll again to the rap/metal infested scene. Their first two records are brilliant. Upon first listen I was horrified. They have really toned down and mellowed the sound. Nothing really rocks anymore. And it's not a subtle change, it's almost like the difference between Led Zep II and III. Grohl must be smoking too much pot. Let's hope they don't follow the path of the Goo Goo Dolls. If you love the first two, just heed my warning. After the first listen, I had to slap on the Hellacopter's Payin the Dues for some instant relief of all the balladry. A big disappointment."
2,This Book is Not for Newbies,"If you are in need of a step-by-step book, this is not the book to buy. It does contain all the resources to find the steps but you must ferret them out. The book is a collection of how-to pieces by many authors and, as a newbie, found this confusing. If you've been in the e-book fray for a while, you will doubtless find this book an excellent reference."
3,Good but overpriced,"I believe this bood does a very good job in explaining the functional aspects of occlusion and the TM joint. My only concern is that for the price, I would expect a book with color photographs and maybe even a CD-rom. That being said, I think the information and organization is great."
3,"Simple, functional but not enough ""buzz""",This product does as it says on the box but when the alarm goes off it is literally for less than 1 sec. The product would be greatly improved by having a longer lasting buzz - Matt.
5,The World Needs More Sea Shepards,"No matter how reckless, irresponsible, or whatever you may want to call the action's of the Sea Shepard's ultimately it is their passion, compassion, and that verve shine through. These people all signed on knowing the risks for doing so and yet were willing to put themselves in harms way not only to do the right thing but at heart out of love for these whales.Whales are incredibly intelligent with a high capacity to feel such emotions as the agony of being shot in the head with a harpoon and writhing in pain for 20 minutes straight before they finally die a senseless death. What people don't understand is its one thing to watch such things from the safety of your cozy living room but to actually have to die that experience is pure hell. And for what, basically the greed of money under the guise of ""Research"".I applaud what these brave, compassionate, heartfelt men and women are doing. If the world had more of these I'm positive the world would be a better place."
5,"""Morgy"" hits home for so many!","I read this book to a grade four class. Not only did it become their instant favourite, but mine too. As a librarian, I recommend this book for its quality and content. The main character is sincere, and like any other North American kid, one with strong emotions and feelings. I was very pleased to see a fresh new approach to how he dealt with the local bully and started coping with the changes in his life. The inclusion of hockey made it popular with both boys and girls, as it is not the main focus of the story. I look forward to seeing a lot more work from Maggie Lewis!"
4,humorous and touching,"This story has shown successfully the transitions a child goes through when moving across country. It was well written so that a child could easily understand and relate to the characters. There were many funny situations and obstacles that Morgy had to overcome in order to fit into his new neighborhood. The way Morgy handles the bully was excellent. The book was written in a way that would appeal to both boys and girls. Children will be begging for more stories with their favorite character, Morgy. Maggie Lewis' first book was a hit! I am looking forward to reading more stories from this author."
3,Battery/buttons dead after a year,"Nice unit at first.+ Slim, light, great sound.- Combination volume/control button on the side stopped working so unable to manipulate menus, and battery holds about 1 hr charge after 1 year of intermittent use."
1,Just sent my second one back...,"First arrived w/ damaged power adapter; Amazon was good about sending a replacement, which appeared intact on arrival. But after an hour on my own (I'm fairly tech-savvy) and TWO HOURS in 'chat' with Linksys tech support, it still wasn't (a) talking to my wireless network (Linksys) or (b) talking to my printer (HP Laserjet 1000). I'm hoping for better luck with Netgear.To their credit, the Linksys tech support were responsive and reasonably capable; the hardware was just shoddy."
5,Great product for old parallel printers,"Great product for old parallel printers. Works as advertised, although I am not currently using the wireless functionality - I have it hooked up with a cable."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINT SERVER,"I have had nothing but trouble with this print server since I purchased it. After looking up the model number via google, I realize the hours of troubleshooting have been a huge waste of time since everyone else has the same problem. Linksys should be ashamed for not doing a better job of supporting this turd, but I will search out another of better quality and buy that instead of losing more valuable time here. Garbage - stay away."
2,Incompatible,"Using Windows XP PC and HP Laserjet 1200 to set it up-The instructions in the box are very incomplete. Several additional steps are needed to set it up, and it doesn't tell you how to get wireless access. I spent an hour on the phone with tech support, half an hour of which was on hold. Linksys tech support came to the conclusion that I need to call Hewlett Packard tech support, which is absurd. I could print test pages from my PC, but not documents, so there was communication between the devices but they could not help me figure out what was wrong. I think it will eventually work, but there are a ton of problems to deal with in setup."
1,back it goes...,"Attention Amazon shoppers: DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE! Don't buy this thing thinking it might actually work in some way. Wireless print server? Ha! A pencil is a more efficient and reliable peripheral than this piece of trash.Terrible documentation, ineffectual tech support, no support pages to speak of.This is pure junk. Releasing this thing was a great idea, Linksys/Cisco..."
1,Useless Piece of Junk,"Normally I like Linksys products. But this time they let me down big-time. Let me say that I have worked in computing, data communications, and networking for over 35 years; so if I have problems with something like this then you can be rather assured that many, many people will. I tried this thing first with an HP multifunction printer, no luck, tech support, no luck, tinkered, got it to function with problems. Then I thought that maybe it was just some quirky behaviors of the HP, so I tried it with another printer, an Epson this time. Same disappointing results. Save your money --- buy ANYTHING other than this piece of junk."
1,Not compatible with Recent OS such as Win 7,"The device is already outdated, and the manufacturer acknowledged that it does not work with the recent OS such as Win 7 and/or Win 8 as specified in the product description. Moreover, the device updates for those OS are not officially released. I as a system engineer, can figure out how to use this, but, most people cannot figure out what to do. Not recommended to users at any level at all."
1,"Terrible, weird disappointing product with no WPA support--returned it","I had been very happy with my Linksys B and G wireless routers, so I decided to give this a shot. What a mistake! I didn't realize until I tried to set this up that it doesn't support WPA security, only the older insecure WEP. That's not acceptable. I cannot lower the security of my network to use this product and I wouldn't recommend anyone else doing so. Another weird thing is that it requires a print server driver to be installed on every computer that will use the print server. Why ? Overall a very poor design that should have never been made. I expect more from Cisco."
2,Only one printer works,"Lots of calls to tech support and even have had a warranty exchange - still can not print to two printers. Only working with one printer.Tech support told me, ""that this print server only works with one printer, the USB and Parallel ports are to give you a choice of which printer you want to use."" I said that the box says nothing of the sort (it actually says you can use two printers at the same time). Tech support also told me, ""your Canon i850 inkjet might not work with this print server."" Again, the box says nothing about this possible problem. I asked for a list of ""non-supported printers"", Tech support won't reveal them and won't post them on the Linksys website. They did say that many multi-function printers won't work, but this Canon is not a multi-function or all-in-one.All of my other network parts are made by Linksys."
1,Very unsatisfied,"After spending several hours trying to install a HP 4050 PS (parallel) and an HP G85 (USB), I could get the 4050 to work, but was finally told by Linksys tech support that the print server does not support the G85. I find it inconceivable that they did not design the print server to handle recent HP printer models. It would help if the website tech support simply listed printers that the server does not support, because then I would not wasted my time."
4,purchase via amazon,I needed this print router for some special work I was doing. I was able to complete my task successfully.
5,Incredibible!!,A must read on the bias way the Warren commission handled this trial.Excellent master inquiry led by Mr.Lane:an eye openner.
1,what a waste!!!!,"This was a complete waste of money. I'm not sure I would call her a belly dancer based on this dvd. She doesn't look like she knows what she's doing. Her performance is a joke. If you want to see a real performance... look for any videos by Darshan. I think she's a great performer and her moves will hypnotize you. Now, she's what you call a bellydancer."
2,Eh,"I probably should have read the reviews on this DVD before purchasing it. I do a lot of dancing and have a collection of work outs on DVD. This is one I wish I could return. I didn't break a sweat unfortunately. The actual performance the instructor gives is pretty bad. It's like she wasn't even listening to the music or going to a beat of any kind. It was cute, but definitely not sexy. This DVD would probably be more appropriate for someone who doesn't know how to dance at all."
2,"Slow down a little, please?","Ms. Zayas completely ruins the intended phrasing by playing much to fast on some of the etudes, namely op. 10 no. 1. Sure, she doesn't have a wrong note on the album, but who cares? Her interpretations are totally dishonest to the score, she takes liberties with the tempi that she has no right to, and, overall, her playing is totally insensitive."
4,its all about slim,"i could throw the tong and oakenfold in the bin! but the slim cd really cooks. esp, the tracks #9 - #10 everybody loves a carnaval - jack it up is incredible"
5,Do Not Be Fooled; This Movie is Excellent,"The Illusionist features excellent performances by Edward Norton as Eisenheim, Paul Giamatti as the Chief Police Inspector, and Rufus Sewell as the evil Crown Prince Leopold. The leads play off each other to extraordinary effect. The plot is brilliant, and fascinating. I was also very impressed with Jessica Biel who was radiant in the movie. A supernatural feel permeates the film as Eisenheim captures audiences with his baffling ""tricks.""There has been much said about the fact that The Illusionist was released around the same time (it was released first) asThe Prestige; however, having enjoyed both films very much, I give the nod to this film. I was very entertained and thought the time spent watching this movie was worth it. The turn of the century Vienna scenery was visually pleasing. Edward Norton continues to be one of the finest actors in the industry.I highly recommend this five star movie."
4,Review of Illusionist.,"This movie will hold you spellbound until the very end. The filmography in itself is beautiful; like an old painting. The plot is superbly wrought, filled with twists and turns and surprises. I highly recommend this film as artistically beautiful and highly entertaining."
4,Strong Performances Elevate the Slow Pace,"Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are very good here, as they always are. Even Jessica Biel turns in a better than average performance. The sets, costumes, and musical score are all lovely, but the movie lacks something I can't quite put my finger on. The slow pace didn't bother me, but the love story didn't hold much water. The Illusionist is a movie worth seeing, but perhaps it is better suited for a DVD viewing."
4,*Spoiler*,"This movie ends like the Sixth Sense. One can say the movie has two endings. The first ending, when Paul Giamatti finds out he also cannot touch Edward Norton, was very good. It would mean that Edward Norton himself was a ghost, sort of like Bruce Willis finding out he too is a ghost in the Sixth Sense. The second ending in which Paul Giamatti has a series of revelations (shown to us using flashbacks) was a bit too much for me, as it seemed too eager to end on a Hollywood-style high note."
4,I loved the look and feel of this film,"Edward Norton, as always, was fantastic. I really enjoyed this film."
4,"Strong acting, nice twist.","I really enjoyed this movie, all of the actors and actresses did a fine job and the story line was really well played out. The love of the two main charecters seemed a bit rushed ,it should have been developed a bit more. The magician, Norton, really had some great illusions and tricks, the orange tree was incredible. Towards the end you begin to find out that he is not supernatural, but a genius at the top of his game. I thought the twist in the end was a bit telegraphed. Overall I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars it was an enjoyable 2 hours."
5,Impressive!,"Kept me guessing until the very end. An exceptional mystery/drama, the Illusionist has a well-written plot that will earn it a place on many household's DVD shelves. A bright cabinet maker's son with a visionary gift for illusion falls in love with a Duchess. Their young love is discovered and the illusionist is forbidden to see Sophie. He travels the world to further develop his magical talents, and when he meets the Duchess again in Vienna, she's the girlfriend of a cruel, egotistical prince. The prince is already rumored to have killed a woman, so for the two lovers to escape, they must come up with a tightly woven plan. The rivalry between the illusionist and prince ends tragically...or does it?Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Superb movie,A well written story with superb acting and a surprising end. I have seen a lot of movies this past year but this is one I enjoyed all the way through.
3,Entertaining Movie,"The movie is entertaining with a small twist at the end. Ed Norton gives a good performance and the cinematography is good.all in all, it is fun to watch"
4,Who is the REAL Illunonist?,"Loved this movie. The ending was really messed up, but was good. These two old friends go to great lengths to better their magic shows, while at the same time trying to trick the other into different circumstances. I was expecting real Magic to be involved, but Science is the key factor here, as is most Magic Shows. The love story and how they intertwine with each others lives was complicated and takes a few minutes for you to get a good grasp on at the end. You finish the movie, thinking ""Did he really do that?"", ""How was that possible?"", ""Which one is he?""...You'll understand at the end of the movie."
3,"Video work gorgeous, story falls flat","First off I want to say I loved the CGI graphics and the imagery. Some of it was annoying..like the fake film grain, but the rest was beautifully done.Now, the story was so predictable. I knew from the very beginning what was going to happen. The story wrapped up terribley and the movie just seemed to drag on (reminds me a lot of the movie AI).Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors. Jessica Beal is a cutie...but this movie was a sour grape in my opinion.2 stars for the dry story...4 for the video work."
4,The Illusionist,This was a rather good movie. I bought it on a whim and was happy with the purchase.
5,the illusionist,"I enjoyed it,it reminds me of the old houdini films,at least this film hasnt got any violence or bad language and nudity in it, in which there are so many up to dates films that have this it spoils the film"
1,the illusionist DVD blu ray,"the illusionist has no english subtitle, the only blu ray i bought that has no subtitle, now do i have to check for subtitle on every order"
3,It was okay. Not as great as everyone says.,"It really wasn't great. It was a good movie. The story wasn't surprising as you knew the entire time what would happen. The special effects were kind of annoying. If the tricks were supposed to be real couldn't they make them real? It would have been really cool to see his props actually be real. Why does Hollywood do special effect when a real model would look much better? It was a good movie... it just wasn't ""great"". Three stars is a good movie. It's good."
5,Ilusion adn romance,"I love period films and especially with a good mystery. And this one is good, and as the story unfolds, you never know if its real or a trick. The characters are perfectly selected for their roles which makes it all more believable. Paul Giamatti rocks in this as he did in LADY IN THE WATER and SIDEWAYS. Edward Norton comes on the screen brimming with mystery.Sit back and enjoy a delightful story of what some people will do for love."
3,"only true love prevailed, the left is nothing but illusion","but, of course, the death of a prince is quite realistic. if he didn't commit any murder, why he would convince himself that he commited a crime? an average movie, not a great movie at all. very slow tempo, loose script. the montage is too dark, trying to give you an ancient vienna feeling. too many and too much close-up shots. with computer generated graphics, everything you saw in this movie is nothing but. the romance is also quite luke warm and not well developed. watchable but on the other hand, also quite skipable and forgetable."
2,Fake Mystery,"You can not actually solve the mystery in this movie. It is one of those movies that presents a problem but there is no way to actually solve it. It's like one of those Scooby-Doo episodes where the monsters end up being real, which in my opinion, ruins Scooby-Doo. Not cool. Get the Prestige instead. If you have money to buy this movie, don't. Spend on something that matters, like food. I gave it two starts because the film-making is OK."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie about magic can NEVER cheat the audience, but this one does egregiously (please tell me how Edward Norton makes the King's sword stick into the stage, thank you very much); add in a terrible performance by the uneven Edward Norton and uninspired photography, and what you get is a movie that has no reason for existing."
2,ok at best,"decent plot, predictable twist ending, dragged on. love edward norton but this movie was very average and could have been better with a little more complicated plot and less emphasis put on special effects tricks."
1,Pointless,"There is no reason for this record to exist. These are attempted copies of the original songs--not *interpretations*, as you'd expect from a ""tribute"" record. Go buy the originals and ignore this very bad idea."
5,Gemini GGE200 Dual Link Cable,I was pleased to get the cables ( Gemini GGE200 Dual Link Cable) needed for my grandson's birthday. He is always specific as to what he wants and this was one way I could accomodate his wish. It came in a timely fashion and we were able to give it to him before he left on vacation.
1,Easy Spirit Christiana Sandals,"I was so happy when I found these sandals. I owned a pair years ago that looked exactly like these and I wore them to pieces. They were my favorite sandals. Unfortunately, when I received these, I was very disappointed. They were not soft leather like my last pair but a stiff plastic material. The soles were rigid and they hurt the soles of my feet. Also, I ordered a size 8.5 and I got sent a size 9, so they were slightly too long for my feet. I really wish these were the same quality as the ones I had before, but clearly they aren't. A very disappointing purchase."
5,One of the greatest RPG's EVER,"These rules are simple, and they are grand. This game perfectly captures the spirit of the original trilogy. At current prices, it is a steal. This version suits ""seat of your pants"" style players and GM's. If you just HAVE to have a rule for evrything, get one or the other version of the second edition. But this one has always been my favorite by far. The 2nd ed book does have some useful information about the SW galaxy, but these rules are so much more. . . elegant. They are from a more civilised age."
4,Not your average cozy,"A great installment in the Beatrix Potter mystery series, although I felt it had a more serious and slightly darker undertone that the first book (The Tale of Hilltop Farm) didn't. In The Tale of Hollow How, there were some occurrences of animal cruelty -- not graphic, but enough to make it an adult-themed cozy.Overall, this book is a good addition to the series and I highly recommend it to everyone who likes a good old fashioned English village cozy."
5,Outstanding,"excellent product for the price,it fits perfect and looks great.customer service is fast and hassle free.an all around great deal..thanks extang."
3,"Mabye, if you don't mind innacurate history.","If you are a purist like me, then you will hate Kessen II. I'm not sure why Koei decided to break its history for historical accuracy in Kessen II. The game screwed up the entire Romance of the Three Kingdoms timeline. If all you care about is some flashy graphics and sound, then mabye this game wouldn't be so bad for you, but I hope not everyone is that shallow minded."
1,0 stars! Did Not Work!!!!!!!!!!,I was so excited to get this game for my daughter but it doesn't work. The game starts up but once you start to play the images in the game black out. Unable to find information to contact seller. Unable to return according to Amazon policy once item has been opened. 0Stars!!!!!
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I was expecting the book to detail good exercises for abs and proper posture. While the book does list some exercises, most of them are ridiculus. For example, ""have a friend sit on your back when you do pushups"" or ""using abs to throw a tantrum. Vigorously flail your arms and legs up and down"". The idea behind using abs for everyday living is a good one, but the book is poorly written. I am in the exercise science field (B.S., M.S., and currently a Ph.D. candidate) and did see the author present at a national meeting. I was disappointed with her presentation and should have known not to buy the book. The author has some good points about proper posture and eliminating the forward head posture, however, she does not provide information on how to change these effectively. Most of the exercises in the book are ackward, silly, or dangerous...such as ""jump around in the pushup position like a flat jumping spider"". Don't waste your money."
1,Not Recommended,"A one star rating is an overstatement of the value of this book. I believe the 15 hours is the time the author spent learning the language.It is not of value to beginning or experienced programmers. It does not serve well as either a review or an introduction. The examples are poorly chosen, (banking account), poorly explained. The other examples are lacking in clarity.Even when something that one knows well from other languages, such as the difference between ++i and i++ is mentioned - it is a mention without an example in a loop or a clear explanation.Look elsewhere to get started in C++. 15 hours would be too long to spend with this book. This was my first look at a ""Crash Course""...... it looks like a train wreck."
4,Taut Thriller,"Dorothy Mills is an engaging, deliberately paced psychological thriller with supernatural leanings. The acting, especially of the two leads is excellent and the direction effective. It's much more character and plot driven than standarad horror fare and builds atmosphere and tells a story more than going for the cheap jump scare. After building nicely throughout, the climax seems rushed and lacks the thought and deliberation that the rest of the film demonstrated. While not quite 4 star quality due to the rushed ending, I rounded up."
2,Brief Review,"The plates in this book are beautifully illustrated and there is a fair amount of interesting information on Iron Age Gallic and British weaponry and armor.However, I found much of the information too be quite outdated and was annoyed at the authors' constant grouping of diverse cultures from throughout Europe into some kind of ""Celtic"" blob."
1,objection to prices,this is an objection to all lego product prices. they should not evcen be allowed to advertise because no common person can afford these things and then your children see them and want them but cannot obtain them because of the greedy toy maker. give me a break.....
1,Knock Knock Who's There: My First Book Of Knock Knock Jokes,"I am very disappointed in this book! I realize it is for a child, but the jokes are horrible. A waste of money. I would not recommend this book for any age."
1,a dark moody book that depresses,"This book had a flat, unappealing style that depressed rather than entertained the reader. It was very, very cynical and failed to excite me as it progressed. it became a chore to finish."
2,End of the Festivities,"The finale of the Feast movies, and the shortest of the three movies at less than a hour and twenty minutes. While it does go about wrapping up things with the other two movies but one thing that bothered me a bit is that some characters that were introduced in this movie was killed off in five minutes or less if not a little longer. Another thing that seemed to bother me a bit was with the one guy that got a pipe in his head, and somehow managed to stay alive even if it was through the brain a bit. Other horror movies that I've seen over the years when something like that happened the character died from a injury like that nor stayed alive for that long. The writing seemed to be decent enough but it didn't seem to be that strong and as for the acting it wasn't that bad yet it could've been done a little better at least to me it could've. Overall Feast III: Happy Finish, got a decent ending not the best, 2 stars out of 5."
3,Feast III,"It had a very strange ending but it was still enjoyable. Very intense deaths and some disgusting scenes, no doubt the opening scene for one. We got the guy with a pipe in his head, an alien rape, limbs torn off, and lots of yucky stuff... and again, the new ""hero"" of the film doesn't survive just like in the first film, oops.. If you liked Feast II, then it's safe to say you'll enjoy the third one.. i think it's an aquired taste..or just extreme interest to see what happens next."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,THIS ONE LEAVES MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. IT DOES TAKE THE TIME TO EXPLAIN NOTHING I MEAN COME ON. STEPHEN KING'S THE MIST HAD PROMISE TOWARDS THE END BUT AT LEAST IT GAVE YOU THE ANSWERS THIS MOVIE LEFT ME MORE BAFFLED THAN SATISFIED. AFTER THREE MOVIES THE DIRECTOR TOOK NO TIME TO EXPLAIN NOTHING BELIEVE YOU ME I WATCHED IT THROUGHLY NO ANSWERS MORE QUESTIONS.
4,The Legacy of Alcoholic Families,"This is a well-written novel about an alcoholic, dysfunctional family chronicled from the vantage point of a man who must deal with his brother's suicide and its emotional aftermath. In flashbacks we see the legacy of neglect, cruelty and the classic shame, secrecy and silence that serve as legacies in alcoholic families. We watch as the protagonist come to terms with his own alcoholism and finds redemption by rewriting the script for his own life.I enjoyed this book very much."
5,Text for College Class,"It arrived promptly and in good condition. It came in handy for the college course that required it, but now I'm not sure what to do with it other than giving it to Goodwill."
2,dissapointing,These lanyards are over-priced and too big. I can't imagine anyone having hands so big that these lanyards would just fit them perfectly. I wish I could return them.
5,Great Gift,"I purchased these for my cousin for Christmas. Sometimes it's hard to buy for boys, but he loved them.! I would definitely recommend them."
2,"A FEW GOOD COVERS, BUT NOT PLATINUM GIRL","I will always prefer Blondie's original versions over any cover album put out. I think the most interesting thing about covers is the bands ability to take a song and present it in a new perspective. This album falls short of doing that. The highlights of the album are versions of ATOMIC and JUST GO AWAY. This album is bands trying to be Blondie. On the Platinum Girl Tribute album, groups put a twist on songs and make them unique. I would recommend this album for die hard Blondie fans that must have every available release relating to Blondie."
1,Not supported on Mac OS X,"This product is not supported on Mac OS X as indicated in the product description. The product says it works with Mac OS 7.5 or greater. To me, 10 is greater then 7.5 so I assumed it worked. It didn't and when I contacted the company (I purchased it from EducationMax) they told me that my Operating System was to new. I've had the same Mac for 10 years and my Operating System is at least 2-3 years old. I'm in the process of returning the product. I'm rating EducationMax 1 Star, not Reader Rabbit."
3,Buggy Software!,"Excellent game, but I've got v1.3 (under XP, and tried on two PCs) and it has a bad software bug with the piano game, as other reviewers have stated. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.This is what I got back from customer support regarding the bug:""Thank you for your inquiry and for choosing Riverdeep, Broderbund, TheLearning Company, and Edmark for your software needs.Unfortunately, this issue does not have a resolution. I want to apologizefor this inconvenience.""It's still well worth the purchase if you're willing to sit with your child during the piano game to try to prevent any confusion and frustration."
1,OLD Program,"This program is about 8 years old. It was represented on the site as being compatible with MAC OS X; it is NOT. I have a new I Mac and cannot run the program the way it should be run. I have an older MAC with Classic 9 operating system on it that can run the program. This product should not be represented as a current version of READER RABBIT. I am a teacher and have used READER RABBIT for many years, it is a great program. This version was great 7-8 years ago!"
4,A 4yr old learns to read with phonics,"Thank you for such a useful, motivating little guide into learning how to read. My grand daughter is having fun too."
2,letdown,"After being completely satisfied with the Toddler version of Reader Rabbit, I found this to be a disappointment. The introduction intimidated the girl I bought it for and the lessons don't draw a young child in like the Toddler version did. It has some learning value, but I'm sure there are better products out there."
3,Interesting read but a bit overly technical,"The good: The principles in this book are sound, and much of the instruction is common in many other books that I have read on the subject of training a dog to track. The authors are very knowledgable and seem to present the material in a structured and logical fashion. I believe those interested in tracking titles will enjoy this much more than those of us who are intraested in search and rescue.The bad: If the authors were to write a book on how to drive a car, they would probaby devote the first 4 chapters on how to build a vehicle from the groung up. My point is while the sections about scent theory are mildly interesting, I think they are a bit overblown and unnecessary. A much simpler discussion would have piqued the interest of the reader."
4,Schultz insect spray,"I liked it, looked as if it took care of some of the mites for a few days, but the insects are back. I used this for the first time and wasn't sure if I had to keep spraying the plants till the insects eventually died or if a one time spray should have taken care of the insects!"
4,A Real Page Turner,This was a well written entertaining romp. I have to admit that I had a hard time putting it down at the end of the day. It was very amusing.
3,doesn't work on all drains.,"Bought two of these drain stoppers. One tub it works perfectly, and the other tub it doesn't fit right. Depends on the tub. Worth a try though. Easier than pulling the walls apart to replace the drain."
2,Room for improvement on many levels!,"First of all, the information is outdated, and I think its important for recruiters to have the most up-to-date information. Additionally, there are grammatical and spelling errors throughout the book, at minimum one per chapter!!!This is the biggest problem with it. For example, in Chapter 8 ""External Recruitment,"" it gives a list and writes out ""first, second..."" and does ""third"" twice. Words are used in the wrong context at times, causing additional confusion to the reader. And the biggest oozy of them all is the statistical error in Chapter 7 ""Measures"" - it gives an example of standardized testing comparisons, and does the problem incorrectly!!! Which led to me having to go back to my Statistics book to review the concept since I couldn't trust the book!Who edits these books anyways?"
1,Scary!,"These looked cute on the website, but holy cow! I should have known that loud, red plaid is not the most flattering choice for a pregnant butt/belly combo.I wasn't too impressed with the construction either. The fabric felt stiff and cheap, and the stitching wasn't very even. Definitely not worth the full price of $50+, and not so much for $28 either. At least they were returnable."
5,Cats love it.,"We bought one if these and our three cats were immediately drawn to it. It worked so well that we bought two more. The beauty if these is that, at least in our house, the cats scratch the cardboard in the middle rather than the furniture."
2,I Want More Dean and Less Kemper,"For a book supposedly about Dean Kamen and his quest to change the world, it is suprisingly more about the author. I was waiting to hear the realy story of Dean Kamen and the Segway, but instead all I got was the story of Steve Kemper (who doesn't really seem interested in the rest of the world). Dean has changed the world (or at least a part of it) through his FIRST ... orgnaiztion, byt Kemper barely mentions it. I recommend waiting for the real story."
3,Not as good as the first,"We discovered Bubba and Beau BEST FRIENDS and it is a great family read. This book offers the same great illustrations but the author strays from her snappy short simple sentances that made the first book so good. She is also trying to find a 'catch phrase' for the books and I think it is ""Sister...."", which is done twice in this book. Loved the first book - 5 stars! While my son likes this book (but not as much as the first one) we are hoping the third book will go back to short, snappy and more fun."
4,Bk girl !!!,"Very captivating, could not get my eyes off of it. The book captured the essence of Brooklyn life, I would recommend it to anyone who was raised in Brooklyn. Language a bit shocking but true to character"
3,It's ok,It was OK I guess it was worth the two dollars I spent or maybe its just me not really my type of book.
5,I Loved It,Soulja did her thing. I bought The Coldest Winter in the book was first published and I still read it yearly as if it was just published. You can't go wrong with a drug infested plot and a self-centered heorine. Again I loved it.
5,One of the greatest literary works of our time!,Sister Souljah tells it like it is with Winter. Winter is indeed one of coldest females that I have ever read about. This has to be one of the best books that I have ever read and the only book that i've ever read more than once. It's worth every penny. I encourage you to read this book asap if you haven't already!
4,"COLD, COLD WINTER","THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I READ BY SISTER SOULJAH, I DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAS ANYMORE. THIS IS A GOOD STORY AND WINTER SANTIAGO WAS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR WHAT YOU WANT. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FAST MONEY. BUT SHE DID WHAT SHE FELT SHE HAD TO DO. THANKS SOULJAH FOR THE WONDERFUL NOVEL."
5,I am glad the book was written in first person.,"The best thing about the book to me is that it was written in first person because it allows us to see ourselves in some ways and how sometimes we can think so much like Winter did. Whether we like to admit it or not, there is some Winter in all of us. We can all be vain sometimes. I really enjoyed the book. It is definitely one of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone. I could not put it down once I started reading it. It was told with so much passion and reality that I wonder if Sister Souljah didn't draw the story from her own life."
3,Great Voice,"The voice of Souljah's Winter was amazing--so distinct, so wonderfully obnoxious. If anything stands out in this book, it is the characterization of Winter. What I found, however, was that the events that occured in Winter's coming of age, or whatever you'd like to call it, seemed quite unrealistic. Every time she was just about to run out of money, she got more. Every time she was in a scrape, she got saved. I thought it was supposed to be a fall from grace of sorts when her father got arrested--meaning she'd have to suffer. She didn't seem to suffer too terribly. It wasn't like I was looking for a Greek tragedy, but...and she still got hers in the end, so...still, I was knocked off my feet by how quickly and effectively Winter was developed. I'm not saying the book was bad at all. It's just that I needed to believe from her fall from grace a little more. Even so, Winter is so obnoxious, I still wouldn't have felt sorry for her."
5,"the bomb, nothin' but the bomb","i'm 13 years old and i sometimes hate to read, but sista souljah's book was off the hook. it had a sorts of drama that you would have never suspected. her book tells it like it is. i hope sista souljah makes the coldest winter ever into a movie cause believe i will be the first one in line to see it. i hope she makes another book like this. i could read this bok over and over again until the book was no more."
5,The coldest winter ever,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome excellent reading. If you pick it up you will not put it down until you have finish reading the whole thing. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Wonderful Job!"
5,a MUST read book; Dont miss out,"I'm not one that reads alot basically I don't read at all, but my friends were doing a book club and this was the book for the month. I read the first chapter here in Amazon and that first chapter, no the first paragragh was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good that I had to buy the book. Alot of times a book may start good, but I lose my interest VERY quick. This book had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. At work I would come back from break late because I won't want to put the book down. The book is actual better than a 5."
3,hmm,"I agree that the book is entertaining and once you start you find it hard to put down but all the characters are in desperate need of development. Also, her use of ebonics was not consistent and it felt as though Souljah threw in a bit of slang when she remembered to do so. Winta's sexuality also seemed over the top. Everything turned the sister on including things like gold teeth! Like I said, the novel was entertaining but that was also all that it was - entertaining and not very deep. I would recommend novels written by Tony Morrison, ""The Poisonwood Bible"" by Barbara Kingsolver and my favorite of all time ""The Color Purple"" by Alice Walker. Peace."
3,I guess I am not like everyone else,This book was okay. I think the most interesting character- Midnight deserved more of a look. He had more dimensions than Winter. I was kind of annoyed with Sister Souljah giving herself a cameo appearance in the book. I really didn't think it was necessary. I will say that I read the book in one sitting in hopes of growth in the main character. But it never came to pass. Winter remained shallow throughout. Maybe I am too idealistic..but I guess this could be considered a realistic portrayal of the seedy drug life that I know nothing about..I did enjoy the realistic and blunt protrayals. But this isnt one of my favorites.
5,Best Book Read !!!!!!!,"I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS, AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS IS THE BEST. I LOVED THIS BOOK FROM START TO FINISH. FROM THE FIRST LINE I KNEW I WOULD LIKE IT. IT REALLY IS TRUE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER, BECAUSE THIS BOOK IS GREAT. I READ THIS BOOK IN 2 DAYS. WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT, WAS THAT IT DIDNT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING. MOST OF THESE NOVELS ALWAYS END ON A HAPPY NOTE. THIS WAS A REAL BOOK, BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE MOST OF THESE KIND OF STORIES DONT END HAPPY. SO I LOVED IT. I AM ABOUT TO READ HER NEXT BOOK ""NO DISRESPECT"" AS WELL."
4,Didn't want to finish,"Sista Souljah out did herself. I could not put this book down, and at the same time I didn't want to finish it. There was a real lesson to be learned from Winter's life. All that glitters is not gold. Great book, I definitely recommend it."
5,Souljah has arrived!,"I am an educator of inner-city adolescents. Language aside, I wish they could have read this material. It really puts a number of things into perspective. Sister Souljah did such a great job with giving Winter a strong and undeniable voice. When I wasn't reading, I would find myself wondering about Winter's next move, as if she were not a character but an acquaintance. I would definitely welcome a film project or a sequel to this book. Sister Souljah has definitely arrived with her first novel. My prediction is that she is here to stay."
5,Excellent Book!!!,"This was by far the best book that I have read this year!!! As I read each page of the book, I could not help but visualize Lil' Kim as Winter. Sister Souljah, you've got to take this book to the silver screen!!!!!"
3,Different Kind of Life,"Well, this book certainly depcited a lifestyle not commonly revealed (though definately depicted in stereotypes).While I thought it was a good read, I was a little disturbed by, though interested in, the totally materialistic and superficial choices made ... even when everything else was lost. If the scenarios were even remotely close to accurate, I'd say we have a segment of society that really needs help and healing.I was somewhat put off by the author's injection of herself as a character ... but to each his(her) own."
5,heart and soul,The author really put some thought to this book. It shows how many women get caught up in protecting their man and end there own self in more trouble the their man. When you let the material things become more important then life it self then you always end up on the wrong road.
5,Sure to chill your spine!,"Souljah has created an urban classic with the unforgettable character, Winter. Set in Brooklyn, New York, this novel engages and enlightens the reader on the inner-workings of a prominent drug-dealing family. The reader is held in constant captivation with the fierce, Winter, her father, Santiaga, and the ever loyal, Midnight.The Coldest Winter Ever is a true Bildungsroman. It chronicles Winter's thoughts, feelings, actions, and reactions, throughout her childhood and young adult life. She is shaped by the people and environment that surround her. As she gets older, she becomes more aware of the impact that the positive and negative influences have had on her psyche.Although this novel is quite provocative in its language and images, its contents are not unfamiliar to a typical teenager. If you're ever in a sticky situation in Brooklyn, be sure your accomplice doesn't get away and leave you to take the blame. You'll have to read the book to get that one."
3,"Welll,,,,,",I am trying to get in contact with you guys because I was charged twice for this book I bought in my bank accountThank You
5,GhEtTo GoSpEl,"FINALLY someone has stepped the game up of ""hood reading "" SISTA SOULJAH was right on the money when she came out with this ! me coming from BROOKLYN i see what she is saying in this book she keeps it real ! winter a typical round tha way girl form tha hood ! i recommend this book to everyone and their mommas and their grandmas and they boyfriends its a great read 5 stars hand down"
4,An insight into the culture of big city street life,"The author is a black activist with direct personal experience of poverty and prejudice. She has dedicated her life to making changes in both areas. This novel chronicles the life of a young beautiful daughter of a Brooklyn drug lord as it spirals down from being the queen of the heap when they were rich and accustomed to expensive clothes, jewelry and respect within the gang culture, to becoming poor, homeless and victimized by former ""friends"". It left me with the grim realization that it is almost impossible to intervene in appealing to youth whose idols are those who can make money easily on the streets even though the long term outlook is not good. It also gave me an education in the language of the streets."
3,was not what I exported,"I know I an pretty late in reading this book, however, it was not what I expected. It did have done great moments where I was wondering what was going to happen next, buy I jst expected a little more, the story didn't go my way I guess, lol. The read was awful as well, I understand she was trying to portray a character but even the narrator was using horrible dialect."
4,Jaw-dropping!,"I bought this book on a whim, and I am so glad that I did. The book kept me captivated.. all the way to the very end. Growing up in a sheltered Southern town, I could barely conceive of the life that this girl lived... but the brutally honest way that Souljah told the story made it so easy to visualize. If you are looking for a riveting story that will hold your attention and leave you in disbelief... then I recommend this book. You won't be disappointed."
4,Real...good...lacking closure,"After reading ""No Disrespect"", I anxiously awaited the release of Souljah's second novel. In both, I think she gives great attention to the transgenerational conditioning of black women on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. She shamelessly reveals what some of us are willing to relinquish in order to gain money, and the illusion of power and respect.The thing that turned me off was the Sistah Souljah cameo.The reason I feel it lacked closure was because you never knew whether Winter would get it together or not."
5,The Best Book Ever!,All that I can say is that this book was too good for words! Although I would love to see it on the Big Screen the cast would be way too hard to create. I would reccomend this book to anyone. It made me laugh and cry and I didnt put it down until I was finished!
2,not that great,"i read this because everyone said i should. it was okay. the story was fine and winter was definitely a force, but i could have lived without it. winter was no tracy from fly girl. i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is a serious reader. the writing lacked serious tightness and sacrficed grammar without increasing the authenticity. mad props for having a best selling book and all that but i get why the people who bought it relate to winter. they have the same limited thought process."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I was so very dissapointed in this book. I think the author should have written an autobiography. ""Coldest Winter"" had characters that were uninteresting and unrealistic. It read like sensational headlines ripped from the latest New York Post. I read until the end hoping the book would redeem itself. I was sadly dissapointed."
1,Garbage,"I did everything I could to keep my daughthers from reading this book, but anything taboo is attractive. If you're as sick and tired as I am of the trash that is thrown at us disguised as entertaining reading material, you will enjoy the refreshing ""Provide the Way of Escape by Susan D. Kersey. Sister Souljah needs to stop feeding our teenage young women with such trash!"
5,Excellent Read,This book is a real page turner with unexpected twists. I look forward to reading more books by Sister Souljah!!!
3,Points for originality,"This CD would have been worse if the cover bands did nothing with the songs. Most of the songs would have sounded better, but then there would be no reason for this album to exist. It is worth listening to for the new takes on each song. But they are very difficult to listen to, especially for big U2 fans. After a while, though, they become tolerable, and you might even like a couple of the tracks as much or more than U2's versions. For me these are ""Numb"" and ""October."" In conclusion, U2 is better at playing their songs than these groups are, but if you are a big U2 fan, you might appreciate the originality of their covers."
4,U2 's biggest FAN thinks this is a fresh look,"As a huge U2 fan I had to buy this album and although this is not normally my type of music I like it for its fresh look at U2s great songs the Best song is New years Day by Tiffany and Front Line Assembly. Tiffany who was huge in the late eighties and early nineties sounds FANTASTIC and I can only hope she records again, her voice is amazing, she has grown up !!!!!. I think any U2 fan should buy this as they will like the different outlook on the best band in the world"
3,lame booking,"has some good matches, but the booking was pretty lame. who could possibly care about a Hardy boys feud?"
1,The Temagami Factor,I was eager to read this book because I lived for a time in the Adirondacks and am interested in the environment but frankly I was disappointed. I want my money back. The Temagami Factor is a weak imitation of a John Grisham novel.
2,She needed help naming her own baby,"I can't think of anything more vapid than hiring a consultant to help her ""brand"" her baby. See Ettus' appearance in ""Preganant in Heels."" I wouldn't trust this woman to choose my produce at Safeway, not to mention give me parenting advice."
3,"Kinda useful, no need if you know how to use a multimeter","This little guy has some uses, and can be handy if you don't already have a multimeter. It basically is a single-use tool, and is great at what it does. The quality of the tool is top notch, and being able to wrap the wires into the hollow handle is a really nice feature. The large display is nice as well."
4,We really like it.,We have owned this for about a year. Our 4 year old uses it for trips and around the house. It has been dropped at least a dozen times and keeps playing. We are starting to have problems with it accepting a charge - you have to jiggle where the charger plugs in and it's getting fussier and fussier. We have chargers for it for the the car and house so we never worry about it running out of juice. We really like this style she can hold it or it will sit upright on a table. When this one dies we will get another one.
2,poor quality....,"I bought this for my 2 year old to watch movies on car trips... battery stopped taking a charge after a week so it only ran on the 12 v plug... sent back to target for refund....Picutre is washed out in sunlight. poor viewing angles, and no remote.I would not recommend this product.. I have ordered a sony FX-820 to replace this so hopefully it will be a better DVD player"
3,fragile,these are delicate headphones I have a pair that broke a couple of weeks after i bought them.the extending adjustment band at each side are easily broken.The drivers are awsome quality however the overall construction is poor not to mention the weight of these headphones is heavy.If you do decide on buying these phones be careful as the adjust band is easyily broken and after one side breaks and you glue it together the extra pressure on the opposite side takes its tole and now you have a broken useless set of expensive headphones.
4,Not tested yet,Came as described. Had to give to my daughter because my camcorder broke. Waiting for her to give me an update
4,Nice! (for the price),It fit right on my hood area where the old one was. It looks nice. I do wonder where I will purchase filter replacements......hmmmm.The light is a bit bright since it isn't covered totally which I miss from my old hood.
4,The demo makes the game worth buying,"I found the demo I got to be quite a challenge, until I found the right strategy. If the demo is true to the game, this is a MUST for any gamer."
1,nails dont stick,"The nails do not stick, they fall off and they don't stay in place when applied. The regular kiss nails are much better and look pretty and natural. When I did thr dishes the nails where in the sink and I put my hair in a pony tail and the nails came off. Total waste of time and money. Do not buy pre glues nails."
3,"RPM release is in full, glorious stereophonic sound.","The ""Zulu"" material is the same program as the original LP, which means that the ""Zulu Stamps and Shakes"" are juiced up with pop influences... but the score itself is in full stereo on this release. The Silva issue of the original tracks is the one that is monaural, not the RPM. Those looking for a clean source for the ""Zulu"" score, this is where you'll find it. The only caveat is that the stereo channels are reversed, but this is a minor issue."
4,7 grandmasters,7 Grand MastersI recommend it its worth the price it brought back memories of my child hood days watching this on VHS. Quality decent i enjoy my copy.1 love
4,Good film with the good fighting and comedy moments.,"Classic kung fu film. Student learns from his master and turns on him. Not the deepest plot,but a good film with some pretty good fighting and some humor. I liked how he developed a brother type relationship with the other characters. I have watched this film a number of times and even let my friends borrow it enjoy it."
1,More APES junk!!!,"This review book was such a disappointment that I can hardly find the words to describe its uselessness. It was a collection of note pages of material any teacher would skim over. The review questions provided were minimum. When I received this book, I paged through it, and immediately asked authorization to return it back to Amazon. I have been teaching AP Environmental Science for six years out of my 37 years of teaching and still have yet to find an adequate, complete review book for this course. For the quality and the price of this book, I would probably consider it on the very bottom."
1,One of the most boring games made after 2000!!,"I was hoping for another great stratagy game that I could add to my large collection of PC games. I usually love Stratagey games, but this game is an exception. The game is very buggy and feels cheesy. For example, when you try to click on something, it takes many clicks before it gets the messgage. And no it isn't lag.I forced myself to play it for several hours thinking that if I gave it a chance, I'd learn to like it, but I just hated it more an more with every waking moment. This game reminds me of a much downgraded civilization 2. Trust me. There a many good stratagey games out there. This just isn't one of them."
3,bla,"I purchase this for myself,the downfall is you have to cut the length of wire to the speakers yourself,there is quite a bit of wire to do most set ups,theres no remote,you cant use all of the output channels, and the rca wires doesnt come with this system.. need a 2 male rca convert to 6 female to be able to use all speaker output.. I yet to find a rca converter.. other than that.. sounds good just dont sounds 600 watts.. more like 50!!"
2,Not a bargain for me,"I bought this Canon MP about 1 1/2 years ago. It printed great for 9 mo., but then the rollers that feed the paper kept jamming on the right side. I couldn't print anything. No problem, it was still under warranty so Canon replaced it with a refurbished unit. Now 6 mos. later, this unit is jamming the paper on the right side. I thought this must be a defect in the model, but after reading the reviews here, I don't see anyone else with my problem. Just beware. This is two machines that this has happened to."
2,Sucks up ink,I had this printer for about a month now and have already used 2 black ink catridges. This machine does not print as fast as it states. I can barely print 12 black pages per minute let alone color prints. I'll say you can print about 4-5 pages per minute(black) 2-3 pages (color)Also machine is bulky navy blue brick(it is not black!!!)scanning and picture printing quality is excellent.
3,PRINTER BROKE TWICE GOOD CUST SUPPORT,I bought this printer in July 2004. By sep. the printer head went bad. I called cust. support. they were very helpful and they had me clean it. The cleaning didnt work. (The cleaning used all of my ink and canon sent me new cartridges.) They had me bring it in to a service center. They were out of print heads so they just replaced the printer. I had the new printer for two weeks and than it wouldnt print out 4x6 paper. The paper kept on falling out before it was finished printing. This time canon sent me a new printer and I got it in less than 24hrs.This printer has great print quality especially on high gloss photo paper.
2,Soap Opera,"String together 10 episodes of a TV tearjerker, replace all the commercials with the word ""cabron"" repeated 50 times, sit back, drink a sixpack of Modelo Negro and enjoy!"
3,Venevision edition,"Bad news, contrary to what the package says, this edition has Full Screen transfer... but at least the extras are really good, and the english subtitles are removable"
3,El Callejon de los Milagros,"The movie itself is a great mexican masterpiece, but avoid this DVD at all costIt have none extra features, and the worst of all, you can't remove the english subtitles.... the aspect ratio is Full Screen and the audio is 2.0I recommend this movie in a VHS rather than a DVD(unfortunatelly the only dvd version of this movie, is this featureless DVD... grrr!)"
5,Superbly engaging and well-acted...Loved everything about it,"This movie is a perfect example of why I favor independent films over mainsttream ( Mindless and Plotless)ones. All the actors fit their roles wonderfully, and you cannot help but wonder the outcome of each of the character's choices. It demonstrates the fact that you don't need a lot of money to make a great, lasting-impression film. It's on the top of my movie list to buy."
2,Wow...A Phenominal Dissapointment,The examples in the book are campy at best. Most of which don't even look remotely realistic.From an artistic standpoint my 15 year old was able to drum up a few ideas that I thought were inventive and could easily be incorporated into a fun and insightful tutorial.
4,Biased book but nice topic,this book is an eye opener but has conflicting views and is hard to understand.
3,How many ounces?,"This is a great product, but does anyone know how many ounces are in the bottle being offered for sale? I cannot find the information on the page. I am giving the item only 3 stars because the bottle size should be readily available."
2,Nintendo is back...,"Well they've done it again. Here we have another system from nintendo where nothing has really changed. I was a hardcore fan until the nintendo 64, but since have found their games childish, the graphics blocky and their developers are also leaving much to be desired. After losing long time backers like squaresoft I would have thought that they would have learned, but it looks like a cool looking system with a new type of game set-up(cd finally instead of cartridge), but nothing has actually been vastly improved. I hope nintendo will change its ways before it becomes the next SEGA."
1,Why?,"I actually would really like a gamecube right now, but WHY can't they just have a simple gamecube for sale? Why do they have to bundle it with a ton of stuff that not everyone may want right away? This kind of sneaky marketing makes it a lot more difficult for those who have smaller budgets to work with, to get a game system, and not just Nintendo is doing this, Microsoft and Sony are just as guilty. Come on you guys let the little gamers have a chance to play too!"
5,Great.,"This puzzle was well constructed & very colorful. My niece loves to put together jigsaw puzzles, & I am sure she will love this one."
5,A favorite!,My 2 year old daughter loves these puzzles. We started with the 12 piece puzzles and have moved up to the 24 piece puzzles. She will sit for an hour - taking the puzzle apart and putting it back together again. The wood tray makes keeping these puzzles neat (I find boxes for most puzzles are hard for her to open and rip easily). The edges of the puzzles sometimes peel but the wood pieces are really durable. Most cardboard puzzles warp over time and are difficult for little kids to put together. We'll be moving on to the 48 peice puzzles soon.
4,wood puzzle,Fast shipping and durable as described but this puzzle was a tad bit bowed. Still works and the kids enjoy it.
5,My kid loves it,"I bought this puzzle for Christmas for my toddler. He loves it and also his big brother that is 4 years old, although it is already easy for him.The product is made of solid wood and hand crafted.Regards"
2,Not that great,"It is water proof, and nice to have in the bathroom, but after a few months, it stopped working, and after a few days of being stuck to a mirror or whatever, it unsticks, and falls!"
3,Not Solid,"The ring is nice looking, and fits. It's hollow. I don't know what it means to say ""solid"" sterling silver, and maybe I'm just ignorant about jeweler's jargon, but solid to me means not hollow, and one hundred percent of the stated material.So the claim, as far as I can tell, is only half true.Obviously, this is not something that anyone in their right mind would pass off as an actual wedding band, to a lifetime partner. I bought it to wear for kicks, and it serves its purpose."
3,"Great charts, so-so text","If you can knit from charts and don't need directions, this book is for you. While the pictures are pretty, the charts are tiny, and I found the explanatory text weak. Note that each mitten comes in one size only - it's up to you to size up or down by changing needle size and/or yarn weight.I agree with the other reviewer about the lack of information on how to do thumb gussets. For an advanced knitter, this could be a great idea book. For those who want more detailed instructions, not so much. A better book for those wanting explanations and details about folk mitten traditions is ""Favorite Mittens"" by Robin Hansen."
2,"Yea, yeah, yeah...","The Gamecube is a great system. The problem is, its a NINTENDO system. If you haven't figured it out all ready, Nintendo directs most of their console towards a younger audience. If this thing was in the hands of Sony, huh, watch out. I mean, just look at the game line up. Ask yourself if you could play some of the games that look appealing for more than haf an hour nonstop. I'm 15, and I passed up Nintendo about 4 years ago. Some of the best games, such as Twisted Metal Black, Nintendo wouldn't touch with a 20 foot pole. I love the PS2, because of the games and power. The Gamecube will have a little bit more power than PS@, but not much, and with no games backing it up. The PS2 is already the console of the holiday season, and three of the hilodays must buy games are on the PS2. My advice, wait for Xbox to be sold for just the console, unless you have to have 3 games and an extra controller at launch, or get a PS2. Trust me. Buy it now. Rejoice later."
3,GAMECUBE IS COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I RECINTLY GOT A GAMECUBE.(...) I GOT A JET BLACK ONE.IT LOOKS SO COOL. AND ITS VERY FUN!! HOWEVER UNLIKE THE DREAMCAST, AND XBOX IT DOESN'T HAVE A MODEM OR BROADBAND BUILY IN.AND CAN'T PLAY DVD'S. SO GAMECUBE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A JUMP ONALL THE OTHER GUY'S IN POWER. BUT SINCE IT'S CHEAPER THANXBOX, AND PLAYSTATION 2, AND IS GOING TO HAVE MARIO, KIRBY, POKE'MON , METRIOD, DONKEY KONG, AND SONIC IT'S DEFINETLY WORTH THE CASH YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. GAMECUBE ROCK'S."
3,it is ok,I bought the gamecube the first day it came out. I really enjoy but i highly recommend that you rent any game before you buy. Because I find all the games really easy. Luigi's Mansion took me no time at all to beat. The only game that has actully changed me so far that i have played on it is Star Wars Rogue leader 2. Though if you are looking for a really fun game buy Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3. It will take you a little while to get the game at first but once you get through it once with one skater then the rest of the game will be easy with any skater.
2,Barely Works Or Hardly Works,"We have a brown/red rust problem from our well water. It lines our toilets and bath drain. This stuff just took off some of the rust but left most.So, if you have a medium to severe rust problem, use Sno Bol for the toilet and use K-Boom for the bath tub (K-Boom doesn't work well in the toilets). Sno Bol works well in the bath tub, too, but you can't spray it around the bathtub for ease of cleaning. You can K-Boom."
5,Terrific show,"This is a great show for those who love the anime Noir, (made by the same people) its very suspenseful. This show has lots of surprising twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You can't go wrong with the price either, $35 for 26 episodes and its Blu-ray/DVD combo pack."
5,Interesting,"If you like anime I would say this is one you should get to add to your collection. It has an interesting story, and good action."
4,suspicious reviews,How much is Patrick Leonardi paying you to say good things about his Microbiology book?
2,from the birds point of view,I currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds. I love the way this one looks but the birds don't feed from it and I'm not sure why. The other one will be empty and they still don't come to this one.
3,Essential Reading for Package Tourists,"This book covers only the hot spots likely to be visited by someone with not over two weeks to spend in the South Pacific. Any place slightly off the beaten tourist track or without comfortable hotels isn't included. Goodwin does tack a few cheap hostels onto the end of his upscale hotel listings, in a condescending way. It's a cleverly written book, well suited to the package tour market. In short, a guide intended to help you spend money rather than save it."
1,I wish it worked for me...,"I guess it works for some and not for others, oh well.I'd take one and wait for it to work, it wouldnt. So i took another one, becoming impatient and irritated, i took yet a third one... still nothing. In the end it actually worsened my condition =/"
4,read this series,"If you're intelligent enough to be reading this, do yourself a favor and read several of the books in this series. I like some better than others, this is one of the better ones. The admirable thing about this series is that the authors equally slam police-state fascism and dunderheaded liberalism."
3,Functional but fragile,"Length:: 1:57 MinsThis inexpensive component video cable works, but is fragile, so handle with care. This video review shows the damage I did to this cheap cable just pulling it through my entertainment center. But for the price, it's worth a little care, and I'm ordering another one to replace it."
3,"Price was good, but they unplug easily","Low price, work, only downside is that the connections are a bit loose. any movement of the cable or the bluray player and the connections slip off slightly screwing with the video colors. So as long as you dont touch anything its great! but having kids around guarantees anything and everything will get bumped or fiddled with"
4,Entertaining View on Timeless Observations,"Since early childhood, I have been fascinated by observing animal & human behavior as well as dissecting specimens, and pondering the similarities to myself and my species. Phil has a unique view on the origins & meaning of life we have all contemplated. Like me, he seems to believe his powers of reason and observation over the rote indoctrinations of school teachers and religious leaders. It's nice to know that I am neither alone nor irrational for questioning conventional wisdom. Still, it's lonely being one of the few that knows that the world isn't flat and that the universe doesn't revolve around the earth. If you don't want your literal creationist paradigm shattered, don't read this book."
5,Quick & Easy,"The transaction was quick and easy. Book came within the week from when I ordered it. Also, the book was in perfect condition, as said."
1,No manual and batteries,I just got it and there is no manual and warranty papers in the box as well as batteries as promised by item description. When i e-mailed amazon they told me to call panaconic for it. How stupid is that? Hate them. Never again
1,Buyer Beware,I bought this TV from Circuit City. After 10 months in stopped working. I spent $300 to fix it only to have the same problem again 6 months later. BEWARE of this TV.
2,my Panasonic TV is broken,"after 3years use, the remote control does not function right now. it is the problem with receiver side in TV.The price is higher than China-made one, but quality are worse.I will never bought over-priced Japanese brand TV any more."
4,Sailing is analogous with life,"This book solidifies many beliefs I have had throughout life that sailing prepares one well for all aspects of life, including the business world. Peter has selected a great group of successful businessmen who have great stories to tell. This book will be used as a gift to several of my clients come Christmastime.As a Star sailor, my favorite story involves Malin Burnham retiring from a race for hitting a mark even though no one else witnessed the event. It cost him the Star World Championship, yet he never thought twice about doing it any other way. This is a great example of an era when ethics and a man's word was everything. We can only hope that it may become that way once again.Thanks, Peter for a very good book."
5,The real deal!,"I simply loved reading this book. Too many books on leadership and management seem to be full of made up stories with little or no relevance to the real world, or they are just downright boring. That is definitely not the case with this book! Not only is the advice real, but it's exceptionally useful to real businesspeople in real businesses, and it's fun to read.And while the business content is first rate, I really loved reading Isler's exciting stories about sailboat racing. It's just like you're there on the water sailing with him -- wind in your hair and salt spray in your face! If you've been following the America's Cup on TV, you know that these guys and gals know all about leadership and team work -- in a BIG way.Kudos to the authors for a fresh take on an old (and often stale) subject!"
5,Excellent and Lucid,Excellent Work. It is a must read for all those working on organizational transformation and build up. Great content and very good writing style makes this book a fantastic tool.
4,To Laugh and To Cry,"Can you begin to imagine two authors of brutal true crime stories, undertaking a project such as remodeling an old 60 room mansion? And can you believe their moving from their home in Manhatten to Aiken, SC? They write of their trials and tribulations, in such a manner, you wipe tears of joy and tears of frustration and sorrow for them. And all the time the reconstruction and renovations are taking place, they are constantly meeting friends and neighbors; while they are trying to hire someone for this project or that project. You celebrate with them over each accomplishment. By the time they finish the renovations, you can 'hear' the music filtering through the wing of the home where all of the parties will be held. Such excitement in the air. I am fortunate enough to live close to this location and took a trip over and found Joye Cottage! Absolutely breathtaking.... wish I could tour the inside."
1,Kind of Creepy,"If you want to read a good book about leaving the Amish, sadly, this is not the one. Read ""Growing Up Amish; A Memoir"" by Ira Wagler. Read ""Prophet's Prey"" by Sam Brower. (Also not great, but certainly better than this.) Best of all, read ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" by Jon Krakauer. It is a great book that also happens to have a great title. Well researched and fascinating. This, however, is neither. This is simply a story chockful of Bible passages and letters from the family begging Ruth to come back which all sound the same after awhile taking up a lot of space, and a thin story line tieing it together. Sorry, but I found the idea of a young Amish girl taking up with a much older, 450-pound man less than desirable and even kind of creepy.If you listen closely, you can hear the whisper ""I sold my story for the money"" behind this one."
3,CROSSING OVER,"It's ok. I don't understand why the girl would leave with a man 25 yrs older than her, but the parts about her Amish upbringing are good."
2,Disturbing..,"Like the other reviewers, I have been disturbed by this book, supposedly about escaping Amish life.All through its reading, I was more concerned about the obese guy, quarter of a century older than the heroine who seems to have nefarious intentions.I am sorry if that sounded harsh but that is the truth. I was disturbed by this man who was willing to date so young a girl, take her away and ""save"" her from Amish life.I wish the author and her husband every happiness but this book was still to me...just disturbing..."
3,Disappointing,"This book did not live up to its description. It is a very superficial look at the societal and familial forces used by the Amish to control the behavior of their members. I ended up feeling sorry for the writer, Ruth. She believes, quite erroneously, that she has escaped a repressive life in order to be with the man she loves. In truth, she is being used by a thrice-divorced man, old enough to be her father, who is too morbidly obese to hold a job. Really quite sad."
5,mixer,this a great and powerful little mixer. love the many speeds and is easy to handle. we were happy also with the price
4,Sweet musics,"They used to play some Darren Hanlon on the radio lots in Australia. I think they're playing him again, but I don't listen to the radio much anymore. I saw him play live a while ago, bought this album at the gig. It's really sweet and fun and different. I later found out he supported the magnetic fields. He is good."
2,"Maybe Fake, or Diluted","This Fragrance doesnt last. I was shocked because it is sold by Amazon.comBut, under the metal bottle frame there is a hole with a hidden rubber plug. I think these bottle were counterfeited and refilled with dilution.THe smell disappears in about 15 mins"
5,Euphoria Men by Calvin Klein,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. I love the scent on him! I will definitely order more for him. It was much cheaper at Amazon than at other sites.
5,smells so good,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.. we both loved it. He wanted to use it for special occasions but i would be happy if he used it everyday. It smells so good on him. I cannot seem to stay away
1,Knock off? Don't buy ...,"I've been using Euphoria for over a year now and I'm very well acquainted with its scent. This is the first time I've ordered it from Amazon. Cologne arrived this morning ... became wary when I noted the cologne itself was more opaque in the bottle than the original ... soon discovered it smelled more like RAID than anything (not an exaggeration). Not sure what this is, but its certainly not Euphoria. Assuming its a knock off? Avoid at all costs unless you want to smell like a bug exterminator. Very disappointed."
2,Smells like an imposter,"I've had this issue before from using eBay. I have an old bottle of Euphoria that was bought from the mall. I sprayed one pump on my right wrist and a pump of the new cologne on my left wrist. The smell of the cologne that I bought from here didn't last anywhere near the amount of time that the older genuine bottle I had. I can't prove that the new bottle is an fake but it has an strong rubbing alcohol smell to it and it doesn't last at all.I wouldn't risk buying expensive cologne for a bargain again, to say the least."
2,"After 3 successful orders, the last one was not the same","We have been ordering this cologne from this seller for about a year, maybe more. My husband loves the scent as do I, and every few months we would order a new bottle. Shipping time was efficient and it smelled great.This last time, however, the smell was watered down and lasted only about half an hour where as the bottles we have received in the past lasted him all day. We even compared an almost empty bottle with the new bottle and the scent was distinctly watered down and even a little different.Amazon, however was quick to refund us upon hearing our complaint. Not sure what happened but now we must find a new seller, which is unfortunate because we were happy with the quality we received in the past."
5,Love it,Mmmm ! Smells great ! I received many compliments when wearing this . Great price too ! I love it
1,Unsuccessful attempt to buy a functional cable.,The original purchase was painless. The delivery timeframe was normal. The problem was that the cable came missing a prong on the VGA end... The seller quickly processed my refund because they didn't have another one to send me.
5,Excellent for hooking up projector via component,"I have an old (2004) projector and was using a hybrid cable constructed from a length of cat5, a DB15 plug, and 3 RCA plugs. These cables weren't readily available when I got the projector. The noise and artifacts were getting to be too much. This cable is far superior. It enables me to hook my projector (yPbPr) up to component with minimal signal loss, zero noise, and no artifacts. I'm very impressed with the build quality with the individually shielded heavy gauge wires."
5,Good stuff,These DVDs were exactly what I expected. Good quality. All of the episodes. I wish more seasons of the show had been made.
3,Every track on this box set is in mono sound!,"Boy, what a disappointment!Every single one of these 104 songs are presented in their original mono sound, just as they were all those years ago. However, nowhere on the package does it mention this important fact.This would normally be a 5 STAR box, but because of the unadvertised mono sound, I give it only 3 stars!A little dishonesty there, Motown."
2,"Poor mixes, poor sound","Someone pointed out in another review that the songs are presented in the original mono versions. More than that, I also have the Chartbusters (12 cds) Mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings, and I have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings. For instance, on Stevie Wonder's ""For Once In My Life"" and Glady Knight and the Pips' ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"" there are parts that are just plain missing. I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them.Update: I listened again. I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing. I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions. It just a shame that the original record company couldn't have done a better job in light of the advent of the CD."
3,"Forgettable, narcissistic teenage angst.","Sounds OK, but not worth the disk space on my computer or ipod. I don't mind listening to it, but I certainly wouldn't seek it out. Mediocre. Yadda yadda.."
4,I LOVE THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM.,WONDERFUL MUSIC TO DANCE TO OR JUST LISTEN. THE BASS LINE IS BEAUTIFUL FOR THE DEEJAYS. SOME OF MY FAVORITE SONGS. IT A MUST FOR YOUR CD COLLECTION.
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to using this DVD. I thought it would have really kicked my butt, but it did not.I finished the entire workout, but I was so bored and kept wondering when it will be over. Sorry this one did not do it for me.Maybe her next one will be a lot harder and more intense."
2,Not So Hot....,"BORING!!! I'm OK with the fact that it is a little (well, alot!)easy for me, that would be OK as you can just add weights for more of a challenge....but I found it boring! And so umotivational! I would never want any of the people on this DVD train me!! They are just plain awful!! I do have a couple of her other DVDs which I really do enjoy - but, my advice is to stay away from this one! Get Personal Training with Jackie: Power Circuit Training or Personal Training With Jackie: Xtreme Timesaver Training instead. Both are SO much better!!"
1,one-on-one training jackie,Another Jullian micheal wannabe!three boring 20 minutes workout. AWFUL do not waste your money! buy 30 day shred and see result.
3,annoying at times,"I really liked Jackie's Power Circuit training DVD, so I wanted to check this one out.I usually find it silly when reviews mention how distracting sets/lighting/participants are. I think that if you're focusing on the workout, it shouldn't be a big issue...To my surprise, I found most of the trainers in this video to be extremely annoying and chatty. I couldn't stand the banter back and forth between them and Jackie...'this is too easy', 'i'm really feeling this one'. And the outfits made me roll my eyes. I'm really not someone who pays attention to these things, but I just couldn't bear it. And seeing them sitting in the background was terrible...at least make them not visible!The workout is good, but I haven't tried it again because I was so turned off."
4,"Great video, definitely challenging!","I love the core and upper-body segments. Jackie is great at reminding you to pay attention to form. The lower-body segment moves pretty fast, so I'd recommend that newbies practice correct lunge form before beginning the segment. Each segment transitions between a series of one-minute exercises followed by a cardio boost exercise, so you'll always be feeling the burn in one muscle group or another. I'd recommend this video to friends."
4,Great Workout,"I tried this DVD based on the good reviews and I feel I got my money's worth. I'm always looking for new toning DVDs so I can vary my workouts. I found that the upper and lower body sections were good, but not as advanced as I would have liked. That being said, she did throw in some new moves I've never seen before so it's definitely great for variety. The core section on the other hand was TOUGH. It may have been the same intensity as the other 2 sections, but that's my weakest area so I really felt this one. I saw a couple of reviews complaining about the lack of real cardio. This is a toning DVD with a little cardio thrown in to give you a little break from the strength training. Don't buy this if you're looking for a cardio workout. I reccommend it though if you're looking to do some toning.EDIT: I wrote this review the morning I did the lower body workout. It is now the next day and I am majorly feeling this workout. I would change my rating to 5 Stars."
4,Kick-Butt Workout,"I've always been to proud to buy myself workout DVDs, but I'm so glad I bought this one. I'm still sore from the workout Jackie put me through two days ago! Highly recommended."
5,The Best Workout Video!,"I love this video because it is fun, has great music & trainers that show the moves correctly. Jackie always keeps you with correct form by explaining how to do the moves. It is very challenging but also has some alternative moves too. You will feel like you are at Skysport Gym along with her. I never rate products but on this one I just had to."
3,Didn't last long,"They were very sticky and on e my kids had pushed them together to make their art, it was impossible to take them apart to reuse. It. Was a very short lived art project."
5,A very fine recording,"Juana Zayas plays these gems like no one else. Not even Martha Argerich plays Chopin as well as Zayas. Both play with heart and clearly have phenomenal technique. But Zayas doesn't sound as impetuous, out of control. Argerich occasionally sounds as if she is coming apart at the seams. As regards the review of ""DB"" of both this disc and Zayas's Etudes, I find that sort of criticism rather cowardly, to say the least. It sounds to me like someone who harbors a grudge against the pianist and wants others to think that she doesn't play well. Of course, his criticisms are utterly baseless, as anyone who listens to Zayas could testify. What is worse, however, is that his remarks sound more like those of an immature juvenile with an axe to grind than a serious music lover. That's ok, though: all are entitled to express their opinion, no matter how foolish they sound."
2,Her etudes are better than her preludes.,Critics are by no means unanimous about Zayas' Chopin. Classic CD's reviewer wasn't impressed and neither am I.
5,A Must Own For Wrestling Fans!,"If you're a fan of classic wrestling in its hey-day, then this is a must own!! A ton of the classic superstars from the 80's and early 90s are featured here. Over 30 matches, included steel cages matches, tag team, and even battle royals. Even though a few of the matches may not be the most impressive as far as pure wrestling skills go, you can't deny the showmanship and the charisma of the matches. But don't get me wrong, there are some very good pure wrestling matches here as well. To be honest, its just great to see all these legends when they were all that the top of their career. I'm not gonna bother listing all the matches or superstars, I'm sure someone already has, but again, I just wanna say that this collection is most definitely worth owning, and watching it is like taking a trip down memory lane..a trip I plan on taking many times to come!!"
1,YUCK!,Pablum! And just a so-so recording. There are ALOT better Chill CD's out there. Try Zero 7's Simple Things. Don't waste your money on this one!
1,Not the best,"This racing wheel isnt that great. It pauses the game when you use it for no reason. it doesnt take good turns, and the wheel lap things come out easily so you have to pause the game, fix it, and unpause it. It is definetly not worth 50 dollars, maybe just 10 dollars."
1,"Great Idea, Stylish Design, Epic Fail on Function","I agree with all other statements about this watches visual appearance; However, the fact this watch HAS NO ILLUMINATION CAPABILITY is what earns it an EPIC FAIL on function. Totally worthless as anything other than a big, expensive piece of jewelry. The inability to see what time it is unless you are indoors under lights or outside with bright sunlight makes this device totally impractical and useless as a watch. In fact, it should not even be called a watch. Call it a bracelet with minimal time-keeping capability. It's other ""feature"" is the ability to suck $60-$80 from your wallet depending on where/who you get it from while STILL *not* enabling you to see what time it is on your watch."
2,OK if You're... Old,"Remember when MTV began?Well, I DON'T! That's why this book is boring to me. They're trying, apparently, to market it to teens, but it's not really a teen's book. There are a few pictures of today's pop stars, but it's mostly stuff from the '80s/early '90s. *Yawn*"
1,MTV Books?!?!,What a great idea! it's about time the top network for young people but out a book or two. teens need to read more.
5,Great biscuit cutter,I am very happy with this product! I would recommend it to others. I made biscuits today and they were perfect.
4,great quailty,"I was pleasantly surprised when I got this. The quality was much better than other cutters I have gotten. I made scones with one of these but didn't notice the fluted edge being so pronounced; not saying this is the products fault, it could be mine since I was in a hurry but I will try it again to see."
5,Best Christmas Album Ever!!!,I've listened to this Christmas album since I was a little kid. Never fails to cheer up the holidays. A real classic and my most favorite Christmas album ever. J5's Christmas songs and Elvis's Christmas songs are the best.
5,Thrilled to find this edition again!,"I am thrilled to find this edition, with marvelous, poetic language unusual in the re-telling of this story. My children had this when they were young, and we wore it out with reading. It is magical and lends itself to dramatic reading because of the language Barbara Shook Hazen used. I am a librarian and have searched for this edition for years, unfortunately mis-remembering the author's name. When the correct name came to me, I jumped on the computer and found it. I will revel in reading this to each classroom when school resumes. If only more children's literature used elevated language of this quality. I highly recommend it for children or even the child in you."
2,disappointing technical quality,"I realize that this cd was a transfer, but I have other music that was transferred from old recordings, and they sound much better than this. The disappointing technical quality of the sound on this CD disturbs me. In fact, it sounds worse than the vinyl I already own. Very loud hissing, some popping. The music doesn't actually sound like it's been recorded in a tunnel, but the sound is not as full as I had hoped.On the other hand, I bought this after comparing Kreisler's performance with Joshua Bell on the samples; and I find I always prefer Kreisler. With no disrespect to Mr. Bell, I find I prefer the composer performing his own music."
5,Ann and Nancy do it again!,"I own all the 'Heart' DVDs/Blu-Rays and this is becoming my fast favorite. The treatment they gave 'Never', by itself, is worth the price of admission. I was disappointed with Heart's 1980's era stuff (without Ann's voice, their self titled album from 1985 could have been Duran Duran or Haircut 100) and was immensely pleased at their treatments of the 80's era material. They make them 'sound' like Heart instead of over-produced, mass-appeal grandiloquence. The sound is pristine and they look and perform as well as they ever have. Nancy is in excellent form and Ann's voice can still drive nails. This is simply a must for any Heart fan. Their current band lineup is second only to the original. Ben Smith is a MONSTER on the drums! Buy. Enjoy. Love Rules. Heart Rawks!"
3,Dual Survival Season 1,Dual Survival Season 1 2 disc dvd. Is a very good tv show on Survuval in the wilderness.Would recommend to friend.
5,Great Show!,"This is an awesome show! Not only do you learn about survival, you are also entertained. Cody and David are pretty funny at times. They both have very different approaches to survival. Don't know how Cody can run around every where without shoes, even in the Artic Tundra."
3,Not bad,"More for historic value than for content, this one shows some unknown series. Daddy-O is the gem here. Worth the price."
3,"Good recipes, bad for the beginner...","I purchased this book as one my first to learn about the art of candymaking, before I really made much.I got it, read through it and found the recipes looked tasty but were seemed to assume some degree of expertise despire the attempts to lay out the basics early in the book.I ended up setting it aside in favor of other books to help me learn the art.Now that I'm more familiar with ""the art"", I've gone back to this book and made a handful of the recipes with extreme success.In short, a good book for your collection, but not the place to start."
1,Do any of these recipes work?,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, who is an avid cook and baker. He'd been having a lot of success with his chocolate melt candy and handmade truffles so he wanted to take the next step.Every recipe he has tried has failed. The ganache recipe he tried first; it came out too runny. He tried the chocolate taffy one, and when he let it cool to the temperature specified for handling and stretching, it was already rock hard. The chocolate creme recipe came out brittle and chalky instead of smooth and creamy.He knows what he's doing and is extremely frustrated. He believes the recipes are wrong.I hope I can find a better cookbook for him."
3,Ultimate? Hardly.,"First, ""700 recipes"" is a bit of a stretch. Many of the 'recipes' are just different variations of the same recipe; using a different 'mix-in' hardly deserves to be called a different recipe.Most of the recipes in this book are easy, melt-and-mix concoctions. They aren't bad, but hardly what I'd expect in an 'ultimate' book. Come on, 'marshmallow krispy squares' as a recipe in a candy book? And nine mix-in 'variations' (which they cound as 'recipes' in their '700 recipe' count)? I call 'foul'.There are several recipes from the book I've tried that simply didn't work at all. I have years (decades) of candy-making experience, so I know I'm following the recipe/instructions... something is just way 'off' in the recipe.That said, many of the recipes work well and are tasty. There area also several that I've yet to try, and I look forward to doing so. I wouldn't consider this book a waste of money, but I wouldn't consider it to be money 'well spent'. It is average, at best."
3,"Seemed interesting, but several recipes didn't work","I acknowledge that sugar work is tricky, but after using this book for a few recipes and then giving it away, I have to wonder how well the recipes were tested, or whether they could be described further. I've had much better luck with Nick Malgieri and Alton Brown candy recipes."
4,Affordable basic high chair,"Great price, good materials, assembly a little like a bike on Xmas Eve, but if I could do it, anyone can. I was very pleased with this chair."
2,Expected better quality,"Expected better quality. The packaging was fine but the chair had many nicks and scratches that had to have been done before it left the manufacturer. I would have sent it back except I needed it for the upcoming weekend. Once it was assembled and the scratches were covered, it looked great from a distance."
2,Quality and Safety Dissapointed,"The safety straps that were on the chair were of poor quality and not safe.The crotch strap was not sewn correctly and would not fit on the crossbar as intended.The latch mechanism, on the seat belt, is partially broken and will not stay snapped when child moves. Child could fall out of chair.I would hope that I get a response from the seller.Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Mahogany"
1,Steak knives on guitar strings...,"Perhaps a fine recording of noises extracted (at knifepoint) from a guitar, but don't be fooled - it ain't music. I may not be able to get my twelve bucks back, but I might find a use for this disk yet - PULL!"
3,Having Technical Difficulties With This Software,"I've been attempting to use this software to move files from an old, malfunctioning, laptop onto another laptop but have been encountering one problem after another. To add to the frustration, the company...Alohabob....is no longer in existence, therefore technical support is NOT available to resolve the software issues that I am having. I'm not sure what else I can do."
5,"""Prisoners"" is a sensible, but sad, book on the MIA issue.","Susan Katz-Keating has written one of the three best books on the Vietnam War MIA issue. Sadly, the issue has been -- and continues to be -- exploited by charlatans, frauds, wannabes, and some honest people who have been misled by the others. Ms. Keating puts the claims of the MIA enthusiasts to the test of logic and reality and their case loses at every turn. Tragically, the real losers in this whole affair are the families of the missing men, many of whom are still having old wounds ripped open by shameless self-promoters. The other two books that I recommend are: ""M.I.A.: Mythmaking in America,"" by H. Bruce Franklin, and, ""M. I. A.: Accounting for the Missing in Indochina,"" by Paul Mather. The Franklin and Mather books are also available from Amazon.com."
2,"Worked for 3 months, then quit.","This product worked fine with my IBM Model M keyboard for about 3 months. Occasionally, the keyboard would seems to lose its connection and reconnect within a second. I'd notice that the lock lights on the keyboard would flash off and on and I'd lose a letter or two while typing. It didn't bother me too much. I'll refer to this as restarting because I figure a short or something in the chip in the cable is causing it to restart. Last night, while playing a game, the device freaked out on me. It began continually restarting. The lock lights just kept flashing on and off and I'd get almost continual missing and/or repeated characters.I've had nothing but bad luck with Belkin products in the past, so this will be my last Belkin brand product."
3,Good for beginners,"I think this book is good for those who know nothing about it. For those the step-by-step process is priceless...It can be a bit dry reading but of course, well worth it."
4,Easy guide for newbies,"Nolo's guide for Social Security benefits helped me determine if my son (diagnosed with PDD) would qualify for benefits in about all of 10 minutes. I found the guide well written, well organized and informative. I recommend to anyone questioning how the system works. This guide is much easier (at least for me) than trying to fumble through the SS website."
1,Unfair,"This album uses songs from 10 ton Pressure. Check the credits on that album. In ""Suture"" Jared took Joe Frank's name off the songs from 10 Ton Pressure, also he is not getting paid. Do not buy this."
4,The best surprise was Colm,"Colm Wilkinson, in military fatigues, as Che, singing ""High Flying Adored"".There are few unknowns, such as Blondel and no videos from the originalproductio. My favorite was Chess, with Barbara Dickson & Elaine Paige singing ""I Know Him So Well"""
4,Excellent veiwing,"The graphics were outstanding in this and the story was very good. (I don't expect less from McFarlain) The relationships and basis of the story were very acurate to the comic. The story line was a little off from the comic. It was a very enjoyable movie. I enjoyed the Gothic atmosphere and the narrative like it was done in the comic. I could definately tell McFarlain had his paws in this one. The graphics were not for kids. It was violent and gore filled. You may not want the younger ones seeing it. All in all a very good adult oriented cartoon. Comic book come to life, so to speak."
4,Light-weight hiker,"Perfect for day trips or walks/light hikes. Well cushioned in all the right places. Not a shoe or half-boot; more like a 2/3 hi-top sneaker, but beefier. Great outdoor sole, very breatheable uppers. Sizing seems about 1/2 size small."
5,TRAIL SHOE,This is the first shoe that i have purch. online. The shoe was everything i expected from the information given at the time of purch. i am wearing them right now.....
4,Last of the Summer wine,Great as expected. I have enjoyed watching them in the past although I don't like taking the time to write reviews.
1,"Avoid, this software is useless","I needed to transfer documents between a laptop and my desktop and thought this program would facilitate the process. The price after rebate made it even more attractive. Well, remember the two adages, ""you get what you pay for"" and ""bait and switch,"" as this program satisfies both. First, while the menu asks what type of files/programs you want to transfer, it transfers everything, even if all you want are files in your My Documents folder. It starts by transferring the programs on the Source PC and then will make registry mods. I don't like messing w/ the registry.While first running the program it asks if you'd like to upgrade to the Ultra version for $19.95, the bait and swith. The documentation states that the Ultra version will allow one to do selective transfers from one computer to another..."
2,THE USUAL ZATOICHI,"If you've seen one Zatoichi, you've seen them all; almost every one has him playing dice, and meeting a new friend who he later has to kill---both scenes are in this movie.But, they're all enjoyable enough, and this one's ok, too, though the plot is kinda confusing. The first 30 or so minutes of this movie are the best, with good direction and photography; gets a bit tedious afterwards. Does have a good battle climax, with Zatoichi once again taking on over a dozen men at the same time, unlike the wimp climax of the movie version of CONAN, in which Arnold needed help.The weirdest thing about this movie: there's not only only a song in English over a montage of Zatoichi walking---but it's the sort of song you'd expect in a ROCKY movie!"
2,"Actually, 2,5 stars...",This is just ok. Nothing else. But don't waste money buying it. There are MUCH better action movies...
3,The good and the bad,"PROS:1. The book does a good job of covering a wide range of songs and difficulty levels.CONS:1. Too many fingerstyle solos (just a personal thing)2. The author plays the music too quickly. Personally, I think several of the songs would sound better at a slower pace anyway as blues tends to be a very passionate style of music.3. Riffs are not explained thoroughly on several pieces. This could be more of an editing issue after the fact and may not be the author's problem.4. Licks need to be slowed down a lot more and he needs to talk more about the positioning of the fingers on the licks.5. Would have benefitted more from a video rather than audio but this book has been out forever. I think I bought mine back in the 90s.Bottom line is that an advanced player would find the book better than a newer player."
1,Horrible,"Dont ever buy this product, out of 5 DVD's that I used, 2 of them already says Format Error and Disk Error, and I had important function being recorded in those :( I haven't even played them once!!! If you want to preserve good memories, DO NOT BUY THESE.....I hate......."
3,"Good book, lots of hand-waving","This is a good book for a theoretical, analysis-based look at probability measure theory. If you haven't had any measure theory or analysis before, you may find it a bit hard to read. There is a good deal of hand-waving in the book (more so than most other texts). If you're using this book for a course, I definitely recommend a supplemental analysis book."
3,Confuzzled,"While these song are GREAT...I cannot get over Carole Farley; her voice is so affected (kind of like a sprechstimme; overly dramatic...). I love the fact that Rorem himself is playing the piano, and as a singer, the catalogue of songs is good to have...but cant say I could ever manage getting over Farley's affectation. There are far superior recordings out there."
2,This isn't rocket science.,Nothing earth shaking here. If you have ever been at sea it pretty much deals with the day to day stuff. Started pretty strong and found I was waiting to pull back into port for a little excitement. I'm surprised he didn't add details of his bowl movements to spice it up a little.
3,Mastered from analog videotape,"The show itself was okay; I loved the opening credits with the marionette. And the video quality looks good IF you watch it on a regular TV and DVD player. However, I just watched it on an LCD HDTV with an upconverting to hi-def DVD player, and I can tell you these episodes were transferred from analog videotape and NOT digitally remastered. This is not the correct way to release this, as it was shot on film and should have been digitally remastered from those original films. That step was skipped to save time and money. I understand why they did it, but it's a bad way to release something in the digital mode. On the plus side, this show has its funny moments (even if it relies way too heavily on celebrity guest stars) and this is a much-loved series to people who watched it as kids. I'm glad it's available, and while the quality's not bad, it could be better by not making the transfers from videotapes, especially analog."
5,Good Times,"I bought this compilation to relive a memory from my childhood. I was 7 When The Lucy Show came to the U.S.Air Force Academy to film a 2-part episode which is included on this compilation. The first thing that struck us, was the clarity and vividness of the color when watched on a HD wide screen tv. It looked as if it was filmed today. Not bad for a late 60's DVD. I will have fun watching the remaining episodes. (4-DVD Set) There are many celebrities of the day on these episodes. The running commentary by Lucille Ball's Kids, was kind of cheesy, but did add a few historical details that were worth knowing if you are a Lucy fan."
2,For Lucy Completists,"Lucille Ball should have stretched her talents in a comedy-variety format. Instead, the immortal redhead dusted off the old routines for ""Here's Lucy."" Time has not been kind to this 1968-74 sitcom, which finally exhausts the Lucy formula. Though Ball, Gale Gordon, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. make a winning ensemble, the scripts and direction are a faint echo of the ""I Love Lucy"" days. Even the guest spots ring hollow - whether it's Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton or Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon. Worse still, Ball's once-sublime physical humor takes on a forced, repetitive quality. Except for a few welcome appearances, Vivian Vance is no longer around to pick up the slack. With its gaudy colors and cheesy sets, ""Here's Lucy"" looks more dated than ""I Love Lucy"" ever did. The extras in this DVD collection are better than the actual episodes."
5,excellent indie rock,"nice album from spiderworks, with some covers from black sabbath, nice interpretation, the sound and style in this cd is quite different from their earlier works, but it's enjoyable and groovy, hope someday spiderworks can be a lesser undergorund and many people finally can hear about them, they are missing a really good band!"
2,Package was not factory sealed,"Amazon shipped this product to me with a package that had been opened and resealed. This is not what you'd expect for a ""consumable"". I needed my printer to work, so I took a chance and used it. It seems OK, but was it used? Who knows."
3,A good looking into italian witches tradition,"this is a deep and valuable look into the strega, a witchcraft tradition of Italy. To understand the Well of Year and the Ancient Mysteries that is a part of Wicca, is very good.My only warn to readers is to statement from the author that Wicca came from the Strega (or, at least, many of it rituals)."
3,Language is a little more off-color than other DVN albums,"Due to the ""potty humor"" in several songs, I'm returning the copies of this album I bought to give to friends and just keeping the one for my family. We are loyal fans of this group since 2003."
5,Now I understand what out of body experience is.,That's the best book i've already read about out of body experience. The author is very serious and is absolutely scientific.
5,Have to give this a big 5 stars,"This story starts out in a town where a woman suffers unspeakable horrors by the hand of her drunken husband. It ends up in a town where another woman seems to be living a charmed life. The thread that binds these two women is one man named-Rick Young, the other is murder. This story is very unique, very well thought out. I have to say it deserves the highest rating."
4,"Quiet, He Might Hear You",I loved this! It really was a great mystery. I urge everyone to get this book! Great characters and you'd have to be psychic to guess the ending! Bonnie
1,I too was conned,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. The writing style was bland, the pace was all over the place, the reader was spoon fed information the plot was revealed in the space one or two pages! The plot would have been better placed in a ""days of our lives"" episode. Mills and Boonish pulp.Like many of the othe reviewers, I bought the book because of the number of 5 star reviews. In retrospect, I now see that they were mainly ""one liners"" and contained no substance. I don't know where they've come from but they certainly haven't read this book. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5,The Best!,"This is truly the best mystery I've read in a long time. I found the story exceptional, and a bit different. A real page turner!"
2,"Great format, but lacks accurate content","As a former interpreter, I am rather critical of this book, mostly because of the numerous incorrect signs and the heavy use of ""English"" signs instead of American Sign Language (ASL).I bought this book to brush up on my signing skills and found this book to be very frustrating due to the mis-usage of signs.The format, photos and layout are very nice, but the content left me desiring more.It is unfortunate the author ""missed the boat"" (TRAIN-GO-SORRY) on this project."
1,worthless electronics,this is NOT region free. it DOES NOT play PAL. Do not waste your money. Do not buy this.This is a OOOOO product.
5,great value,"I am very pleased with this player. While I never heard of the manufacturer, I have no complaints about their product. I have ordered several dvds from amazon uk and they play beautifully. It even says ""HEllO"" when you turn it on!"
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"I bought the Pioneer DV-393-S DVD player for its multi-region capabilities. A friend of mine bought this very same model, and he received a region 3 player that played any region and was PAL and NTSC compatible. The player I received was a region 1 DVD player and it DID NOT play my region 2 DVDs. I was able to play a region 0 PAL DVD, so it still can translate PAL to NTSC, but other regions were now locked out of this player. So if you're in the US, and it's a multi-region player you're looking for, go with something else."
3,I like it...,"s'OK I suppose. It's a fairly bare-bones DVD player that has so far played every format I've thrown at it. I really have no gripes with it functionally and it looks nice. If I had to choose a defect, it would be that it responds a little slowly to commands. I'd buy it again but not at this price."
4,Plays everything I can throw at it,"I have tested this unit for few weeks now. It plays everything. I did not believe it, but it reaslly does have a built-in PAL/NTSC converter. It REALLY works....... I have a JVC, and a Sony that I paid over $100/each for........ but they will not play other regions.Even for region 1, it will play on a PAL tv. This is a big advantage... My wife has many relatives in South America, and we have been sending DVD's to them, not realizinf there was a different system. We sent them one of these players, and t is perfect... Thanks DAKMART... $70 is a real STEAL for this"
3,Pay attention to what this DVD player can/can't do,"I unfortunately did not do my homework on this DVD Player. I read and trusted other customer reviews which said that it played multi-region DVDs. This DVD player is NOT a multi-region DVD player. In the manual it states that it is a REGION 1 player (US) only. Although the player did play 2 of my British (Region2) discs, I had a dozen more that it would not play.It's a great DVD player for the price, just not what I thought it was.....my fault entirely but I want to make sure no-one elsemakes the same mistake. Shipping to return the item was costly!"
3,Not Sutherland's best,"As wonderful as Dame Joan's voice is to me. I never found her singing of Casta Diva to be accurate, I think most of the aria lies in the lower part of the soprano range, and that is tough for her. So she has to push, and there is a beat in her voice in her later years. I also find a lot of off keyed high notes hear, and that is unforgivable in bel canto opera.The golden voice is half gone. I would recommend this only if you've already heard the young Sutherland. We don't want you to think that this is what she sounded when she was the toast of the operatic world. Because this voice on this tape is only 1/2 of the voice she had 10-30 years ago.However, if you want to hear La Stupenda when she was the reigning queen of bel canto, I would recommend the follow VHS tapes. The singing in those are magnificent.The ""Voice of Firestone"" The ""Bell Telephone Hour"" The ""Age of bel canto"""
5,"Meet the Mertzes----I read it in two days! It was informative, and great! I really enjoyed the book.","My only wish, for Meet the Mertzes, would have been to add somepictures!! That would have been awesome Kat"
5,Really Great Book :),"We just got this book for our 3 year olds birthday. My husband read it to him as soon as he got up so it would start off his birthday (since he wouldn't get his present until after my husband got home from work). BIG hit! He loved it and still loves it :)It is a longer Dr Seuss book, be warned! It isn't as quick a read as say, cat in the hat."
5,Yeeha,Glossy and crisp. Never used. Dirt chep for a costly hardcover. Grandchildren love it. Six more words required required required.
2,mischaracterization,"Fossum's book is mildly enjoyable; the prose is spare--perhaps too much so--but the story is interesting, albeit transparant in places. Some logical inconsistencies exist in the plotting, as well as a seemingly substantial emotional inconsistency re: the actions of the boyfriend toward the end of the story. (I'm trying not to give the ending away.) But, as the mother of a Down syndrome boy and an educated person with extensive knowledge on the subject of Down syndrome, I am queasy about Fossum's treatment of her Down syndrome character; sexual predation is virtually never part of the Down pathology. Down's people have enough troubles without being tagged with this kind of reputation. Granted, the last scene is ambiguous; however, its ominousness is clear."
1,SPELL BINDING,THIS BOOK IS A GOOD MYSTERY. I ENJOYED THE BOOK AND THE MYSTERY. THE INSPECTOR LOOKED AT ALL SIDES OF THE CASE PRESENTED BY THE BOOK. SO I GIVETHIS BOOK A FOUR AND A HALF STARS.
4,Loved it!,I have been looking for new mystery/crime/thriller authors to read. This one was suggested to me and I loved it! Fast paced and kept me guessing. I've gotten very good at figuring out who the killer is early on in the novel but not in this one. Well done!
5,I discovered Karin Fossum with Don't Look Back.,"""Don't Look Back"" by Karin Fossum is a first for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very good translation and depiction of life in a small Norwegian village. It's too bad that some are annoyed by the ""difficulty"" in the pronounciation of the names...I found it quite acceptable, perhaps because, having traveled the northern countries I appreciate the differences of the various cultures. The character of Inspector Sejer is so true to life in that part of the world. I thoroughly enjoyed the ""cool"" suspense that kept me from putting the book down and I am looking forward to my next Fossum."
4,It's like having a small monkey in your head at all times.,It's like Matthew Sweet meeting up with the P Funk All Stars and having a love child. That's all I gotta say.
4,Good looking watch,"Very attractive watch. Purchased for my husband as a gift. A little tricky on setting the alarm and stopwatch, but looks great on his arm and is easy to read."
5,Well worth it for the money,"Fairy Tail is in plain words Amazing! I love this show and highly recommend it to all who love anime or are looking to get into anime. This show is filled with characters that blend funny moments and action packed fights really well. This is all wrapped up in a beautiful story that is well put together and really makes the viewer feel for these characters. In all this show is great and you should buy it, well worth the money."
1,A Little Too Weird For Me!!!,"I got this DVD free(Thank God) but I wouldn't have used my free coupon on this DVD had I known what I was getting into. Inner Wave spooks me out! It has no Yoga, dance, or meditation. It looks like Crazy people waking up from the dead and having a difficult time awakening. I DO NOT call this DANCING nor Meditation, and surely NOT YOGA! Maybe I'm ignorant and don't understand what's going on? I do know that this DVD is not for EVERYONE, especially sane people. Maybe, I will replay it again someday and comeback and change my rating? Until then, I'd steer clear of ""Inner Wave.""Overall rating: 1.0"
3,Not your typical Wiggles video,"My two and a half year old absolutely loves the Wiggles, but he lost interest in this video pretty quickly. It is not the typical Wiggles with goofy and catchy songs. Don't get me wrong, the Christmas songs are great and may interest older kids more. The Irish choir was fantastic. But, the choir and all the guest singers really lost my son's attention. On top of that, there were some actual costume changes (not sure I've ever seen the Wiggles wear anything except the 4 colors before) and some performance scenes/video with the Irish choir. At one point, my son even said ""is this Wiggles?"" Dare I say, the video is not low budget enough. It's not consistent with the simple songs and skits that my son is used to."
4,Great C.D.,Can anyone tell me how much it is to join his fan club? I found the address but not a price!
2,"A lot of information, unfortunately a lot of errors too","This book is a good starting point, but all information should be verified. There seem to be quite a few errors. It would have been nice if the source documents for the information on each individual were listed."
2,small letters,"It may be helpful and rich in details and rules but the font is a bit small to read for my eyes, hence not very relaxing. Had I known, I would not have bought it. Although I learned much, I found that card-counting looks cool in movies but is impractical since most casinos deal cards down in one-deck games to prevent card counting."
3,Excellent for historical perspective but of little use today,"This is the book that started it all, at least for the ""rest of us"" who weren't mathematicians. It is a wonderful read, and excellent for historical information on what the game used to be like in Nevada.It is, however, useless to try to learn current playing skills from this book. It is simply too far out of date -- like trying to learn software engineering techniques from a book published around the same time, in the early 1960's. The state of the art has changed dramatically.Buy it only if you have already learned about the game and want to gain some perspective on the origins of card counting. For that, it's a ""10""."
5,One of the best!,"This book is of historical importance because it is the first book written, as it is the oldest, with a viable counting system. A must have for your blackjack library. I also recommend, for modern games, Gregorian Strategy for multiple deck blackjack."
3,A blase book. There are better,"This book is shabby compared to the book written by Harold B. Simpson:Audie Murphy, American Soldier. This book was printed in two 5000 ea volumes editions. I have the Veterans edition. This book was published in 1975 and is now a very rare collectors item going for at least $75 and as high as $300.00This book is worth every single detailed fottnoted page. It is acomplete expose on his early days, through his heroics on the battle fields. I am a penultimate fan of Audie Murphy, I served with the 3rd Infantry Division at Kitzingen, Wurzburg and Schweinfurt for over 7 yearsof mu military career.Charles Whiting would have done much better had he researched Simpsons book for the references written in the bibliography.I would therefore giive Whiting a c- in journalism for this book."
3,It is verry quiet but...,"The clippers are very quiet, I usually cut my hair in the early morning whilst everyone is asleep, BUT the teeth move! You can make a mistake easily and have to get a balled head! They are nicely made but tat is a problem."
2,I guess they're decent if you do preventive maintenance on them.,"First off the ""lube for life"" blades are complete bull, after 8 or 9 uses they started catching on my hair so I oiled them up. If you don't oil them you'll end up pulling all of your hairs out instead of trimming them. The ""reduced vibration"" also becomes nullified if you use them more than 8 or 9 times. Once hair starts getting inside the blade and motor assembly the thing becomes a mini diesel engine. For those that might use this maybe a couple times a year and clean it out after each use these might be a good choice otherwise I'd go with Wahl or Andis."
1,The worst piece of crap ever.,"As far as clippers go, this one isn't worth the space in my garbage. Immediately out of the box the blades are really dull and even going over the scalp several times doesn't cut the hair. Thankfully we got this on sale at a local store so we didn't waste too much money."
3,not bad for the price,"buying one of these is cheaper than paying for a trim at supercuts, so there's definitely value.however, even when i cleaned it regularly, and oiled it like they said with their oil- it still only has enough life to cut my hair about 4-5 times until it starts to pull and pinch my hair as i'm cutting it. but then again, that's 4-5 haircuts at 20 dollars a piece that i saved on, so i look at it as a win."
3,Great Trimmer -- Cheap Fragile Plastic Guides,"I agree with some others reviewing this item. The trimmer itself is pretty much flawless. When I kept my beard a bit longer, I used two of the guides, and a few teeth broke off. These days I just keep my beard short and I have no issues because I don't use the plastic guides.So... If you keep your facial hair short enough that you don't need the guides, this may be the trimmer for you. Otherwise, go for a unit with better made accessories."
3,Too Somber,Looking for a little backgroung dinner music. this was too somber. felt like I was at a memorial instead of a cocktail party.
3,Rotterdam is the one.,"The Rotterdam recording quality is much better, superb by any standards I can imagine. There are two sessions. The first is more atmospheric and with more extended high frequency information. The second has a closer perspective and the better sounding to me. The first one sounds like it's EQ'ed up a bit. The second is more full bodied with deeper tone and the more satisfying musically, as well, to me. Sublime stuff."
3,Minnie loves her bed,"My american bulldog loves her bed. The only thing is that it says you can stick the bed in the laundry but the first time I did....the actual bed tore open. The cover for the bed is fine but I won't be able to wash the bed anymore, only the cover."
4,"Hard to find, but really good","Out of all the Betty Crocker Bowl Appetit varieties, I like this one the best. Unfortunately it is hard to find so I bought a case on Amazon. I gave it 4 out of 5 because it isn't the healthiest option. (The one thing I don't like about these is that you have to microwave them for 5 1/2 minutes in order to get the noodles done, so it makes this really hot. Personally I don't like my food at very high temperatures, so I end up putting these in the fridge to cool them down. Just an FYI.)"
4,Pretty Good,Tastes nice enough but isn't amazing. I bought these for my husband for the days that I don't get up early enough to pack a lunch for him. He doesn't like them enough that we'll buy them again. Instead I'm buying some other microwavable meals for him to try. These are good for those times when you just want something quick and easy and not too expensive. A little classier than Easy Mac. One of these might not be quite enough to fill you up.
4,Good Gadget,Works as described on website. It would be nice to have the neck a little longer as the plug is poorly placed in my car. Requires a little bending and stretching to read. Would also be nice if it held a residual charge for a minute or so. That way you could pull it out and look at it. Bit does what it says and for a good price.
3,Product appears to be working as advertised.,"Ordered two of these for use in travel trailer and tow vehicle. Both arrived in same box in a timely manner. One unit worked and the other unit did not. Returned faulty unit with a request for a replacement. Never heard from supplier regarding the requested replacement. Other unit seems to be working fine. I really needed both units to accomplish my purpose. The non-response from the supplier regarding a replacement for the returned unit has somewhat soured me from using them again. I can understand a small percentage of failure in products, but non-responsive customer service is never tolerable. If they had replaced the defective unit as requested, I would have given it a 5-Star rating to date."
1,Defective Right of Out of the Box,Monitor indicated the same identical 13.68 volts for two (2) different 12 volt batteries in two (2) different cars and displayed a red light (PROBLEM). Returned it for a refund. The old adage applies: “You get what you pay for.”
5,Battery Monitor,I bought the Sunforce panel and charge controller with this monitor. It works great. I used it to monitor the charging system in my diesel truck and my autos. Driving 1 vehicle letting one sit I can use it to monitor the battery in the one sitting. Easy to follow directions comes with it. A great tool to have for 12 volt systems. Even measures the battery when engine is running to test alternator. It is a must have tool very easy to use.
5,works great,I bought this for my truck camper. It worked great and now I know exactly where my battery stands. Bright and clear display.
5,Very useful device,I have several of these devices which I use to monitor storage batteries in vehicles stored for the winter. The Equus monitor is also very useful for monitoring the charging status of a battery you have on a maintenance charger such as that in an RV.
3,Might Keep You Out of Trouble,"I'm not sure how accurate this thing is. I have a new battery but this will show less than 12V after a few hours with the engine off. It will, however, show over 14V after the engine is started. I would assume if it stays consistent that you can tell if there is a problem at some point in the future. I think this is more useful than the factory gauge. I would recommend getting this type of voltage meter if your battery is getting old."
1,"A ""Do Not Buy!""","I originally planned on giving this boxed set '2-stars', but decided to rate it with only 1 to offset any unrealistically high ratings. I was not pleased with these interpretations of both Bach's Brandenburgs and his Orchestral Suites. I am usually quite pleased with the work of Andrew Parrott, but not at all in this case. The Brandenburgs are played with too, too much zeal, almost with the same effect as with turning a music box's crank too quickly. The whole 4 CD set has a ""squeeeky"" quality to it. I think that the quality of Andrew Parrott ends with the works of J.S. Bach. He is excellent ""from Monteverdi to Vivaldi"" (The title of an exceptional boxed set of his), but not beyond. For both the Brandenburgs and the Orchestral Suites I give my highest recommendation to Christopher Hogwood."
4,Fatal Flaw,"I have had several Brother MFC's throughout the years. All of them have had a by-pass where one could feed either an envelope or a sheet of labels through the front of the machine, open a door in the back of the machine and then print with a straight paper path so the envelope doesn't get rinkled and the labels don't start to come off the carrier sheet, which is especially important if one uses Stamp.com's labels where the same sheet of labels may be printed on up to 10 or more times as one uses up the each label. Other than the foregoing DESIGN FLAW, its a good machine but for me, this is a FATAL FLAW so I took it back to Office Depot. It was interesting to get the reaction of a couple of techs at Brother as they too couldn't believe the engineers forgot this critical function! I will just have to be satisfied with my MFC-8440 until they come out with a new 30 page per minute duplexing machine with the old by-pass capability."
5,Best Laser Multi-Function,"Just bought my second MFC-8860DN for an apartment complex office. I have the other at my home and I will agree that it is very noisy, but who cares? It's a printer, not a Cadillac. The noise lets you know it's working. The consumables for this printer are reasonably priced for how long they last. It is letting me know that I am nearing the end of my first drum, so that lasted over a year of hard use. The Brother software works well on PC and Mac, I have mine networked through both. Scans and copies letter and legal, but you have to set up through the software. I have mine set up that if I use the buttons on the printer (which is more common) it scans letter, but if I use the software buttons, it scans legal. I really don't have anything bad to say about this printer and I have been seriously underwhelmed by printers my whole life. It's a big, medium volume printer for a heavily used home office or equivalent. If you have this need, this is the printer for you."
5,Betty Crocker Sunkist Lemon Bars,"Boyfriend had been hinting about these bars and telling me how wonderful they were but couldn't find them anywhere. So for a ""just because"" item I thought I'd surprise him. He had been trying to find them around here but no one carried them. Only makers like krusteez or some other brand that just didn't taste right. So his face lit up when he opened the box. Thoroughly satisfied. He made some that night and they were great!"
4,Problem with product,While I already knew how good the product was before purchasing from Amazon I was dissapointed in the packaging. Four of the individual boxes had stale product inside due to the cellophane packaging not being sealed properly. I was dissapointed and had to dispose of the product in these boxes.
4,Nice Magazine,Nice magazine to keep you updated with the latest of the state of start technology in Computer Networking.
2,Disappointed..would not purchase again,"I'll start with the Pros: Plenty of storage when shopping, nice cup holders, 1 handed steeringCons: Very bulky & difficult to get into & out of car trunk, very heavy, the front wheels started bouncing up & down after using it for 6 months, 1-2 times a week making it very hard to push, & also very wide (I was always knocking into something).I wanted to be able to use it for subsequent children but will be throwing it away instead. I am not usually very critical of most products but I was very disappointed with many aspects of this products performance."
3,"""So so"" travel system","This is an OK travel system. There is plenty of storage and I like the wipe and cup holders. The only problems (for me) are the front wheels get stuck ALL the time and are very wobbly, the fabric is scratchy and kind of cheap, and it doesn't seem to be padded enough, and may or may not be uncomfortable for some infants. My daughter is fine with it for right now, but she does get very uncomfortable if she is in there too long. Next time, I will spend the money on a better travel system."
3,nice...but,"cute car seat, however be aware if you have a jeep liberty(mine is a 2003) the care seat sits very upright for an infant car seat. Due to the way my seat naturally reclines, and even after adjusting the different levels I do not recommend this product for my car.just an fyi"
1,Analysis of Keaton Few and Far Between Boring Summaries,"The other one-star reviews of this work were right on. It is, for lack of a better word, terrible. Various authors offer surprisingly similar takes on Buster Keaton's classic silent film, 'Sherlock Jr.' Unfortunately, these essays refrain from any deep analysis of the film (or other Keaton films for that matter) and instead choose to summarize, over and over again, the film across 191 excruciatingly boring pages. Avoid this book at all cost. Many, many other, better books analyze Keaton, his films, and his career better than this one, which fails miserably."
4,Decent Gary Daniels movie,"Not as good as the later Gary Daniels films, but still decent. The fight scenes are good, though it is obvious that no contact is made a few times. A decent car chase, a cool hero in Gary Daniels, hot asian women, action makes this film worth something.This movie will never hit DVD cause gary Daniels was never popular."
2,Not to the potential,"I think that Gary Daniels is way below his potential in Deadly Target. In his other movies I'd like to think that he has set a new standard for all other martial arts movies to follow. In Fist of the North Star He shows himself to be like a deity and in Bloodmoon and Recoil and Cold Harvest but in this movie one has to settle for very very good. This movie has joint locks without the snap or the one vital second of silence where the audience and the henchman realize that the limb has broken.Yes, this is a good martial arts movie Yes, it makes Van Damme look like a pudgy schoolgirl. Yes, most of the world could watch this and say ""Oh, Wow!"" But I know that Daniels can do things that take the martial world a step farther than it was the day before. And this movie IS good but only good. Sorry Gary."
4,"Excellent Card, Linux and Windows Compatible","I'd like to confirm that this card is compatible with Red Hat Linux 8.0. It is based on the Realtek RTL8139D chipset. There is no IC socket for installing boot roms on, but most people won't care about that. I found the card was easily installed and worked like a dream from the first go. Red Hat Linux detected the card an loaded the right device driver immediately.Provided you install the included device driver, it should work just fine on Microsoft Windows machines too.This card appears compatible with modern motherboards such as the Asus P4T533.The price is so good I'll probably buy several more as spares since I do a lot of work with other people's computers and appreciate hooking them into my DSL network to grab operating system updates."
4,a great freestyle cd,"I enjoyed this cd alot. I wasn't sure who Onnie was and I took a chance on buying this cd.The music is true freestyle and the vocals sound good,so are the songs i loved the song all thats on my mind and ""time for love"". The cd is amixture of new skool freestyle with alittle kick of the tradional old school and latin freestyle. avery good freestyle cd."
3,Chill Out with a wrong title,"I feel that a better title for this CD would have been along the lines of ""Global Cooling"" or something else snappy. While the CD is ok to listen to for a cool wind down after a hectic day, I feel that the reason it is associated with anything ""Buddha-esque"" is so that people will associate it with the series and purchase it expecting a similar mix of tunes.It is not a bad album - I do enjoy it for relaxation, but I really feel that it was mis-marketed. The variety you will find here seems to be a little more globally oriented than the actual series from which its name was derived."
5,Great game!,"We enjoyed this game the minute it came out of the box. It is very addicting!Maybe not as well made as some of the older Front Porch Classic games that we've seen, but still pretty sturdy and adequate.We took it camping and had great fun with it!"
3,Great for armchair sailors,"If you want to know how old-time sailors did things, this book can tell you in impressive detail. For a sailor on a tall ship from the last century and a half, however, most of this book is irrelevant, and could better be replaced by Eagle Seamanship (at a fraction of the cost)."
5,Just get the book!,"If you are here intentionally you should just get this book. I bought mine along with several other books at the Naval Academy's museum store in Annapolis, MD but it was a couple weeks before I seriously began to realize what a treasure this is. The other books on ship ""anatomy"" and modeling show you the parts and often just lead you to ask ""what is that for?"" and ""how did they do it?"". Unlike the other books this one has the answers with a skillful use of diagrams and photos. Ever wonder how to box haul a frigate or cast off the buntline lizards? The answers are here. Sheesh, I don't think O'Brain himself couldn't have done it better."
4,"Great picture, PIP not functional......","Great picture and style. Glad I went with the LCD model. No glare and nice bright picture. It has PIP but after a few months and a number of ""cable guys"" working on it, we still have not gotten it to work. It only has one tuner! The PIP needs to work off the extra inputs. If the PIP worked like my LG flat screen (26"") it would get 5 stars."
2,very disappointed,"I went to many local stores to learn which LCD's were considered the ""best"". Samsung was in the top three. Have had it less than a year and half and motherboard is blown. No picture, just sound. Motherboard has taken 5 weeks so far to come in (still not here). Seems like parts are hard to come by."
5,predator 2,"I KNOW,I KNOW it does not say predator 2,but its inspired by predator 2.in predator 2 he did destroy the city,in fact he took on danny glover in that one.but there is a pred.2 video game...FOR GENISES GAMESYSTEM!!!!!"
2,Rich people are boring...YAWN,"This book is too over-the-top madcap to enjoy. The author tries hard to be original and cheeky, but the result is that the prose is forced and obvious and the novel is one slow read. The most boring parts are the mother's diary and Fergus's imagined articles about himself. I skipped over most of that drivel. Who cares what happened back in the 70's in London? The reader wants to know what's happening NOW. Essentially, this book has no plot; it's just a bunch of unrelated scenes strung together. The characters are too farcical to be believed.Also, having lived in Akron at one time, I was disappointed that the book had so little sense of place. It could have happened anywhere. Oh yeah, and books about rich people are always boring, unless written by Sidney Sheldon."
3,Some preliminary remarks if you're thinking of purchasing...,"I was a little disappointed with this book, it is more designed for a teacher-student course and definitely not for self-studiers of a foreign language. The clear direction on Lao sounds is good, but overall I found this book difficult."
2,"As Always, the Crucial, Defininitive Cut Isn't Here","Why, why, why is there always the one, definitive cut left off of the ""Best of"" disc? Beats me, but there were a few songs besides ""London Calling"" and ""This Year's Girl"" that signalled the end of the endless, interminable era of Burkhart-Abrams dominated radio (they were the nasty radio tyrants who were determined to make sure you never heard The Police, REM or Blondie on American radio. They programmed the bulk of commercial radio with ""Free Bird"" and ""Stairway to Heaven"" with the notion that U2 and all that other ""punk crap"" was a soon-forgotten fad).One of these songs was called ""All For You"" by a cool but obscure European band called Simple Minds. The song incorporated the attitude, grind and instrumentation that would inspire a new generation to eschew day jobs, embrace the D.I.Y. lifestyle and sport ""F**K ART, LET'S DANCE"" tee shirts. It's not here, although, commendably, ""Life In A Day"" is. Bummer, though. So close."
4,Love this show!,"My family absolutely loves this show. I have two young daughters and a young son so I can relate to them a little bit. My daughters sit glued to their seats when it is on and we try to watch every episode on monday nights. I love Kate, she is such a great mom and she doesn't try to be fake for the cameras. What you see is what you get. She and Jon parent their children not let them get away with murder and they are not spoiled brats like too many kids these days. More people should watch this show. You will all love it if you watched it. I know I do!!!"
1,avoid this game!!,I bought this thinking it would be good with all the features it was suppose to have. The only thing good about this game is the create a wrestler mode. The matches are boring and long!! Who wants to fight for 30 min!!!! You have to have perfect timing to pull off a move and you have to stop and hold L to breathe so you don't run out of breath!!! When I play a wrestling game I want to fight not to breate and not to have perfect timing!! With 150 wretlers is good but it doesn't make up for the terrible matches!! AVOID THIS GAME NO MATTER WHAT!!!
1,The Most Confusing Game EVER,"When I bought this and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 for my GBA, I played this first. I didn't understand it at all and it wasn't fun either. In fact, it was extremely boring! I hate this game, it's even worse than Super Monkey Ball, and that's VERY VERY BAD!!!!"
1,a shabby scrapbook,"Little Richard is such an important figure in 20th-century music that it is crucial that there be a biography of him out there. However, this biography is more a scrapbook than a polished work. Oftentimes, you can't tell when the author, Richard, or an acquaintance is speaking. There is no analysis of the events in Richard's life. This book pales in comparison to texts on Billy Strayhorn, Josephine Baker, etc. This book drags on about concert after concert after concert. Besides, Richard is in his homophobic phase at the time of the book's writing and there is no attempt to put his self-loathing into context. I needed to learn more about Richard, so I am glad this book exists. However, this was a poor piece of autobiography and I am surprised that the author did not take the time to fine tune his work."
3,Another Live Record,"Just three years after the lackluster Year Of The Horse, Neil Young released another live set, Road Rock, Vol. 1. The record is another good, but not great live set. There are some great tracks including the mammoth 18 minute opening track ""Cowgirl In The Sand"". The song, even at its tremendous length, does not seem drawn out or over extended. ""Words"" is a great old chestnut from Harvest and is a treat as is ""all Along The Watchtower"" which is a duet with The Pretenders leader Chrissie Hynde. The rest of the album is okay."
2,Very disappointed,"As an avid Neil Young fan I was shocked at the lack of quality of material, compilation, sound reproduction and the band itself. I will always remember Sturgis, S.D. circa 1993 when Neil played to a full concert house of bikers in Rapid City as the BEST concert I ever attended by any artist. Advice: forego this CD and listen to any of his earlier live concert recordings. Bring back Crazy Horse!"
1,BIG DUD FOR ROCK ICON,"Let me preface my comments by saying that I not only respect the song writing and musicianship of Neil Young, I have seen him perform live two times. However, this CD is lame at best. The performances are tired, the band(including Mr. Young) seems like they would rather be somewhere else, doing something else. You can get much better quality versions of these classic Neil Young tunes on other recordings. The five channel aspect of this recording is almost non-detectable. It seems that not only does rust never sleep, but it is alive and well here."
4,Great Socks!,"These are terrific, and the first pair of low cut socks that don't slide down in my shoes. Love them!"
1,not very easy to understand,"I started the book verycurious; however,I lost interest afterone or two chapters.Hard to follow & understand,probably because one mustalready be familiar withwhatever author was writingabout. DEFINITELY NOT for beginners."
1,Catholic?,"I bought this book in a somewhat needy state of mind as my Mom had just died recently. I wanted something consoling, helpful, informative, and imbued with my Roman Catholic faith. This book didn't do it for me. I found it to be mostly psych talk with Scripture and references to certain Church teachings thrown in. My other question/concern about it is that I can't figure out the author - is he Catholic? This book title says ""Catholic"" in it, he refers to himself as a ""priest"" in the introduction; but within the book, he refers to The Book of Common Prayer (from the Anglican church) and the bio at the end of the book says he's an Episcopalian. What gives?"
1,THERE IS SOMETHING FISHY HERE!!!!,"Read the review of rjnathan, as it pretty much says it all...First of all, read the excerpt above, it's really not that entertaining, and we must assume that the author thought this was one of the better parts of the novel.Secondly, all these reviews are suspiciously sound the same, don't you think??You should stay away from the kind of SHAMELESS self-promoting.Hope you don't fool too many people Mr. Roman"
1,Pretentious and Boring and caught self promoting again.,"See review below for ""Be Cool"" and note the address ... again!!!Cheesy.A reader from Haverford, Pennsylvania , February 28, 1999 Sharp, Witty and Cool Another winner from Elmore. He is the champion of great, witty, smart dialogue. Along with FRIED CALAMARI (which also contains very sharp witty dialogue), this is the best contemporary fiction I've read this year."
2,Horrible taste!!,"Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it. It might be a good protein shake but it's extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse =( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!!"
2,Not the best,"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint."
1,Chlorine - not a poison but a benefit,"The author appears to have a distinct anti-science bent. But without chlorine and science, you would find yourself living without medicine, clean water, bulletproof vests, and the list goes on. Moreover, the author gives no viable alternatives to replace all the benefits of chlorine. If I had not been made to read the book, I wouldn't have wasted my time."
3,it was ok.,I have to say that I liked this book better way better than the first and the third book; i hated those books. But the book (actually the entire series) are rushed. I ordered these books from Amazon based on the great reviews; dont waste your money. They're boring and do not have satisfying endings (except for this one perhaps). I dont connect with the characters. I dont know why everyone else liked it...
3,Pretty Good and Goofy Movie,"This movie was based on a combination of the 1920s Red Grange/Ernie Nevers stories. Grange played for the Chicago Bears and Nevers played for the Duluth Eskimos, and they were 2 marquee players who helped put pro football ""on the map."" While it isn't perfect, this is a pretty darned funny movie. Clooney shows real flair in front of and behind the camera and the dialogue comes at you pretty fast sometimes, like a 1940s comedy. John Krazinski is also pretty good as the hot shot (Carter Rutherford) whom Clooney's character (Dodge Connelly) relies on to keep his team, the Duluth Bulldogs, financially afloat. The only real complaint I have is that 1. Zelwegger really isn't that beautiful (the kind of lady guys would die for) though she tries hard to match Clooney in the ""looks department"" and, 2) I wish they had more football scenes. Also, too bad they didn't do more with the ""CC Pyle"" character, who played Krazinski's agent. He showed some real talent. A good flick! See it!"
2,"Boring, couldn't stay focused on it","This was a boring movie. It seemed like not enough was happening. I like George Clooney, but not in period pieces, and I like John Krasinski, but apparently he is best in ""The Office"" because none of his movies have been any good. Renee Zellweger overacted. I kept drifting away while this was on to vacuum or wash dishes."
3,Enjoyable,"Clooney tries to make a film as good as 'His Girl Friday'. 'Leatherheads' isn't as good as that classic, but it is enjoyable enough. Renee Zellweger, who I used to like, was the weak spot of the movie - she's adequate, but she's no Rosalind Russell, that's for sure. (I also thought she was the weak spot in 'Cinderella Man', an otherwise strong film.) Clooney does his typical self-deprecating role, with good comedic effect. And the film looks good, all sepia-toned and Roaring Twenties styles."
2,Leatherheads a Disappointment,I looked forward to watching this movie because the few clips I saw were funny. I also figured how could I loose buying a movie with George Clooney and Renee Zellweger. I could and I did. I didn't find it funny. I found it dumb. Screwball comedy is very hard to do and this one missed it by a long shot.
4,GOOD BALLAD COLLECTION,"THIS COLLECTION WAS GOOD BUT MISSING ""SWEET CAROLINE"" AND""STAY WITH ME"" TWO VERY GOOD TRACKS. BUT I BOUGHT IT ANYWAYBECAUSE I LIKED THE OTHER BALLADS IN THIS CD. IT'S VERY HARDTO GET ALL THE BALLADS ON THE SAME CD. TOO BAD THEY DON'T HAVETHE ANTHOLOGY OF ALL THERE GREATEST HITS. THAT WOULD BE KOOL!!"
3,very low budget film,"I love horror movies,but I thought the quality of the film, and the acting in the film were horrible.I would not recommend buying this movie."
4,Hear them live,"This cd sounds like it was produced by a grage band.It's scratchy an unpolished.I had the oportunity to hear them live last night at the Hartford Civic Center and belive it or not thy actualy sounded better then than on the CD.So if you can,see them live."
1,Little kids do not rock!!!!!,"I recently heard this album playing ata record store recently, it sucks so bad that people were begging the store employees to turn off ""that terrible cd"". Even Hanson fans that I know were very disappointed in this album. Hanson needs to go back to that garage."
2,Disappointed.,"Beware - the suit closes at the back - that is if you can call it ""close""!I was under the impression that it would be a zipper or something like especially as being fleece it is too hot to wear anything under it.Not really sure where the designers were going with this. There's only a little tie at the back of the neck and because the chest/belly part was very roomy the material tended to balloon and so everything from my shoulders to my lower back was bare to the elements...A bit more material wouldve done nicely in the bum/crotch area - this tended to pull tight when bending over or sitting down.The foot is basically a shoe cover secured with an elastic band.So unless you are prepared to put in a zipper or to get someone to stich you into the garment - might be a wiser idea to look elsewhere for a Thing costume."
3,Intro to the D200,"It did what I hoped it would, but some of the information was somewhat irevalent. It was still helpful."
5,Classic slow jams,"I wouldn't have ever known about Con Funk Shun if it hadn't been for my friend from high school. This is an album for anyone who likes the ""Smooth Grooves"" collection or for anyone that has ""The Slow Jams Of The 70s"" collection or ""The ...Timeless Collection"" . This album is filled with classic slow jams. Whether it's the 70s: ""Make It Last"", ""Let Me Put Love On Your Mind"" or ""Straight From The Heart"" or the 80s: The Michael Cooper classics, ""Love's Train"" and ""I'm Leaving Baby"". Even if you're not a fan of the 70s funk era, this collection of ballads is definitely worth the $12 or $13."
1,Not actually available,"I don't know why this listing still says ""In stock."" I wish it were, but when I get to Amazon check-out the following message always appears:""We're sorry. The quantity you requested is no longer available. The number to the right is the maximum quantity currently available."""
5,Great Sleep Help,"Love the way this product helps sleep, helps leg cramps and provides vitamins and minerals all at the same time."
3,Nice and small but...,"It's a nice phone but for the price it doesn't pack a whole lot of punch. The one thing that upsets me most is that there is no way to edit/add different ringtones to the phone. Another thing is that I have to download 3rd party risky software just to change the background. Lastly no camera, no mp3, and a flaky graffiti pad. Too much to pay for it's tinyness."
1,Horrible software,Just got this phone.Software will not load on an XP machine. Error I receive is Error -1607: Unable to Install InstallShield Scripting Run TimeI am going back to the treo 600. A bit larger but it was up and running within seconds. Other advantages of the treo.- speakerphone- camera- vibrate- external readoutI hope sprint reads this review and fixes these problems.
4,Gripping,"Triage is a solid, thought provoking film set amongst the world of photo journalism in war torn countries. Whilst to the public their material is often just a news article or photo to peruse whilst reading the morning newspaper the toll it takes on these journalists to bring these stories to life is much darker and their plight often overlooked in the name of sensationalism. Triage examines the human experience of working in hostile environments and the repercussions of such actions. All the performers are great but as usual it is a much thinner than usual Colin Farrell who really shines here, filling his reporter with strength, weakness and tragedy to really capture the essence of a man truly torn apart by what he has witnessed and what he has done. Its a shame films like this slip through the cracks and end up straight in the back corners of video rental shops and retail outlets whilst shallow big budget dross appears at cinemas across the country regularly. Recommended."
1,Doesnt fit 1991 mercury capri like specified,Took my capri to sears auto center and technician said that this cv axle wasnt even remotely close to fitting. Also said this was for an ABS vehicle.
4,Three for One Flicks,"'The Burbs' is one of my favorite comedies, and the other two aren't bad, either. A triple dose of Hanks for a low price in one package."
2,Warning!!,"This book should *only* be read by those who are already well educated on all the issues it covers. It is written by a ""subject expert"" to other ""subject experts"".The book was assigned for a class I took, and was roundly hated. If one was already quite conversant on the subject, and was fascinated by it, it would probably be a good read.Its greatest failing, in my opinion, was Freehling's propensity for referring to things (as if the reader already understands), rather than explaining."
1,Awful,"This book is weird. The cover makes it ""look"" interesting, but looks are deceiving in Freehling's case. His writing style is downright weird--he intersperses what seem to be fictional accounts with his actual history, and uses strange colloquialisms that no serious historian would ever even think of putting into a scholarly publication (I mean, who even says ""blackassed?"") I had to read this book for a history graduate course in fall 2002, and it was hated by all in the class (even the professor), except the sole southerner. If you want to become informed about the secession crisis, read a US history textbook, but do NOT read this book."
1,Yawn,"I think I would have had more fun being gagged with a wooden spoon. Or eating the book.....might have gone down better. In all honesty thought, I fell asleep after the first three pages the first time, and in the past year haven't even reached page 20."
4,How one family lovingly deals with the diagnosis of AIDS,"Curtain Call by Patti Fields is a compelling account of the final journey of a vibrant young woman diagnosed with AIDS. Told in two voices, that of DeeDee, the patient, and Patti, the mother, the Fields family describe both the practical, caregiving details and the painful emotional rollercoaster of living and dying of this disease. Through the use of alternating journal entries, their stories are told with poignant immediacy. From DeeDee's point of view, her story is a cautinary tale for young heterosexual women. For those of the parental generation, Patti explores the challenges and ultimate acceptance of the inevitable. This inspiring book illuminates the positive bonds of love and devotion that hold families together through trials, loss and even beyond."
2,Not even close to the VUE exam for Network+,"I recently took the exam and was shocked how different the exam questions and topics were vs. what's printed in this book. This book is easy to read and you do learn a lot ..but just don't let it be the only book you use to prep for the exam. I don't think any of the sample test questions from the CD (included with the book) were even close to the exam questions. Despite all the negatives, I ended up passing the exam but I'm giving the credit to my own luck and experience instead of this book."
2,Could use a lot of improvement,"Image quality and variety was medium. While there are some excellant images, I had to search for them through multiple categories to find them. Many, many of the images were childlike, almost cartoonish, and I'd be embarassed to use them in a religious group's newsletter (my purpose). In addition, each image seems to have a vertical black line built into it at the left side, which forces me to edit the image and overlay part of it with a white stripe. One should not have to jump through these hoops! I also could not save an image to disk; I had to select it, copy it to the clipboard, and paste into another document.Granted, some of the images are inspirational, and there are many of a wide range of subject matter (e.g., Jesus's miricles). However, each time I load this cd to look for an image, I sigh a sigh of frustration, and wish I had something better to work from."
4,A Large Collection with Some Good Choices,"This is a large collection and it is not all Christian. There are some Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim folders within the collection as well as some secular ones. They are mostly, pretty well organized in sub-folders that make sense which is a big help in a large collection. Most of the images are in color and of good quality. All in all, this is a good collection.In the last few weeks I have purchased about a dozen religious clipart collections. Some have better images than this one but I would say that for the money, this is probably the best collection I have seen so far. It is definitely a keeper."
3,Falsely Marketed by Publisher!,"I was excited to see this product, as I remember the rumours of Sham 69 and the Sex Pistols merging. However, upon purchasing this recording, I've discovered that Steve Jones and Paul Cook are completely absent from this recording. This is Sham 69 alone in concert, and the credits should be listed as follows:Jimmy Pursey - VocalsDave Parsons - GuitarDave Tregenna - BassMark ""Dodie"" Caine - DrumsAdditionally, Track 6 is actually the Pursey/Parsons song ""Everybody's Innocent,"" which is an original Sham 69 song.Aside from the misleading labelling, this is an awesome recording, and I highly recommend it to all punk fans! If you're a punk fan, despite the absence of Sex Pistols personnel, you'll still love this CD!"
3,Great story but slow moving,"Henry Poole has a great story to tell. In an era where God is essentially absent, the movie takes a bold step toward faith. The problem is the film moves at a snails pace at times and in the end, you still don't know where Henry (Luke Wilson) lands even after his ""miracle"". It's a good movie which could have been much better. BnB Beatles Depot"
2,Poorly Researched,"As to the three main points that sustain this movie.First, I am familiar with terminal illness and how it is diagnosed in a medical setting. This movie unfortunately presents a dishonest view on patient diagnosis and subsequent treatment for a potential end of life illness. The specifics and testing procedures are not done as shown in the movie and are far more thorough. To suggest that diagnosis of terminal illness is commonly mistaken or to suggest that God sends miracles to a chosen few is an affront to all who deal with life ending illness.Second, to suggest that the vehicle by which God sends miracles is through a few drops of something on a building (or any other artifact) does a disservice to the core values and essence of any religion.Third, on the positive side the movie does do a respectable job of portraying rational thought in conflict with irrational belief."
4,"Faith,hope,and Henry Poole","Luke Wilson is great in any film he's in.He's a fantastic comic,and in this movie,a wonderfull dramatic actor.""Henry Poole""has a message,and the ending is heartwarming.The rest of the cast along with the soundtrack is superb .I would recommend this DVD for the entire family."
3,An unknown conspiracy!,"If you like reading about conspiracies, you'll love to hear about the plot to overthrow FDR. You can find it in Jules Archer's book The Plot to Seize the White House."
5,"Change your life, today!","I have never read Brian Tracy before. This was recommended by a friend and I picked it up first from him and read. Then I realised that this is a classic. I have a Book, a *pdf and the audio book version of this book.A classic step-by-step book on just to start chganging pour own perspectives. Some of them are unimaginable, but they work. - Writing my Own Obituary, for e.g. When I first read that, I said.. ""whoa.. what the hell is this"". As I read more and started putting it into practice, I could see the essence of the chapters.This helps one take control of their lives. achieve what they want to achieve and not really be a victim of 'situations'. I believe in the subconscious effects that a written goal provides! The book help build some clarity into thinking and how-to tackle that clarity to become something.If yoiu do not read this, you are missing SOMETHING!"
1,Lies,"Perhaps you have heard of the Yale (or Harvard Business School) study of goals in whichonly 3% of the graduating class had specific written goals for their futures. Twenty yearslater that 3% was found to be earning an astounding 10 times that of the group that hadno clear goals.Brian Tracy repeats this lie in this book. Such authors also irresponsibly repeat the myth that we only use 10% of our brains. Pure fantasy. Steven Covey repeated that one in First Things First. It's getting tiresome when I fact-check these self-help gurus and 90% of the time discover that their making it all up.Well, it turns out that this ""study"" is merely an ""urban myth,"" as extensivereviews of the research literature by me and by Steven Kraus (a social psychologist fromHarvard) as well as investigative reporting by Fast Company magazine revealed that nosuch study had ever been done!"
1,wont play on brand new panasonic dmp bd-60 DVD player,"useless disk set, is formated as a double-layer DVD9 disk which won't play on newer blueray upscaling player... Frisbee anyone?"
3,More like 3 1/2 stars,"I guess I expected more. I just came onto amazon one day and looked at what cd's other customers bought who also purchased 'Atomship' and 'Three Days Grace'.It's almost like they are a water-downed Linkin Park or something.None the less, I wish I could have a refund of my money.You can take a chance on buying this cd if you want. Just don't say I did not warn you!"
5,Hypnotized By Pillars Music,"Wow. thats all you need to know. Wow. Every track is awesome and any of them could have been released as a single. Different sound then Pillars first Cd but it's a good change. They left the rapping behind. I could listen tot his cd all day. Much better than P.O.D. they are a Christian rock band but their songs are not gospely or anything. Favorite tracks: Hypnotized, let it Out, Bring Me Down, Simply"
3,Definitely worth buying for the price,"As a mob enthusiast who enjoys reading about the ""lesser"" known crime families, the information was spot on and told from a true local author/journalist. For the $7.00 price plus $2.98 for shipping, it's well worth the $9.98. Scott is a much better author than he is a host on video and it didn't flow the way an A & E biography would flow (nor was there any background music that helped with the storytelling), but it was informative and educational for those who do not know much about the Detroit underworld. I highly recommend this documentary."
5,The glossary at the back of the book is helpful...,"...and might have helped ""sweet soprano girl"" understand the reason for the way Chinhominey is spelled. The glossary at the back of the book says that the ""romanization for the accurate Korean pronunciation of the word would be CHINHALMONEY. The spelling of the word as CHINHOMINEY, however, is intended to reflect the Americanized way it would be pronounced by Grace and Christina."""
5,Rock anywhere,The very best tape to be encountered. Highly recommend them because they are the BEST.
3,Decent but missing the feature I bought them for.,Recieved the gloves yesterday after ordering specifically for the Wrap around velcro closure feature because I already own a pair of everlast gloves with the velcro strap and I found it hard to secure the second hand once one glove was on and it didn't feel as secure on my hands.These gloves also run on the smaller size compared to my other pair.
2,not the exact gloves,i ordered these but when i got them they didn't have the Chinese words on them.
2,too small,It seems that I was sent the wrong size on purpose. I was sent youth size. These gloves were to small for a teenager let alone an adult! I am very unhappy. My advice order them some wear else!
4,Needle rebalancing required for Australian magnetic dip,"Being an experienced engineering geologist I have used Brunton compasses on many occasions and am pleased with their quality and ease of use. However, when ordering my compass recently I overlooked the problem asociated with magnetic dip in the southern hemisphere. Here in Melbourne, the compass is unusable due to strong needle tilt obstructing movement. The compass needs to be held at an angle of about 10 degreees from horizontal to get a directional reading, so clearly rebalancing is required. One would hope that geographic area of use could be specified when ordering from Brunton and local suppliers would presumably know this. So if you are buying from Australia check!As it happens, I have a job for my new compass in the northern hemisphere, so expect it will work OK there."
5,Memoru Upgrade,buying from amazon is like you buying from the Factoryi bought this item [ASIN:B0000510NX Memory Upgrades 128MB 16X64-8 PC100 Unbuffered 168-Pin Sdram]you will not find a better deal than amazon.com
1,"Bad, Bad Skater!","Oh man, I hated this movie! I'd just watched ""Dogtown And Z-Boys"" (which I loved!) and was looking forward to seeing some eighties skate action after that great view of the seventies. Anyway, this movie is a total bummer. The skating is boring, the style is bad and it doesn't cover the eighties skateboard era well at all. If you don't already know the story, Gator was a sub-par skater who became a corporate sell-out and a has-been in short order. He was an arrogant jerk. He once punched one of his young fans after the kid asked for an autograph. As his career started to fall apart, he became a born again Christian. He then raped and killed his ex-girlfriend's best friend as a revenge ploy after she dumped him. He's currently serving life in prison. Perhaps some kind of redeeming documentary could have been made out of this sad and depressing story, but this film is not it."
4,Great Work Here!,"If you used to follow Mark Gator back in the days and want to know the whole story, this pretty much covers it. It's a good biography of his skateboarding career and of course what happened in the end. Worth the time, must see for skateboard fans."
4,These authors are gifted with insight and awareness.,"I have a new respect for the FBI and intelligent, compassionate law enforcement. This book turns the tables on traditional criminal psychological theories and practices. I have personally peeked through the dark side. Those involved in corrections at any level have to read this book to achieve insight. These authors reinforce in this book, all of us must listen to our intincts in dealing with people, and teach it to our children."
4,A must read,Informative for everyone. Will help everyone as it helps get into the minds of predators.
3,Lacks style and clarity.,"I've read numerous true crime books--this one does not rank high on my list. The book reads like a compilation of newspaper clippings. He only superficially examines i.e., ""probes"" the psyche etc., of the ""UNSUB(S)"". I think it would have been a better read if Mr. Douglas had more thoroughly written about, at most, only three of the predators. He also could have gone into the lives of the victims/victims' families more than he did. He did not bring these people to life at all--the perps or the victims!!! They were all just 'subjects' he was writing about.Plus, he only spends one chapter (the last chapter) on his thesis.Some non-fiction writers have great style and prose. Mr. Douglas is NOT one of them."
1,Douglas is stepping out of his expertise,"In Obsession, Douglas is telling tales based on the accomplishment of others. He cites the Behavioral Science Unit's Ken Lanning on child molester matters and Robert Hazelwood on rape classifications. He cites Gavin deBecker's work on stalking giving superficial advise on topics he really does not understand himself, nor does he have any personal experience on these matters. It is obvious in his last two books that Douglas has run out of material and is now searching for topics to keep his books going. Douglas should quit the books while he is ahead of the game."
2,Bad Book,"I found this book to be very dry. It is the cut and paste life of Loretta Young, with many errors that I have found from reading other matterial about her life. There is even a lie that they tell as the truth. They write that a woman came forward to say that Loretta Young gave birth secretly to a baby in a Catholic Hospital. That is very untrue. While Loretta Young did give birth to a baby she gave birth to the baby in a house that she and her mother owned, not at a hospital.I would not recommend this book if I wanted to know about Loretta Young. I would recommend Uncommon Knowledge or Forever Young-the Life, Loves, and enduring faith of a Hollywood Ledgend instead of this book."
5,Pony UP!,Pony Up! is a katastro-awesome band. You should definitely get this. But the picture seems to be of a Bloc Party album....and that's weird.
4,Entertaining read,"I found this book to be entertaining and engaging. I thought the other reviews were a bit harsh and it seemed like maybe the book hit a bit too close to home for them. Ok, this book won't change the world, but it was interesting and fun to read. I live in the midwest and apart from a brief trip to DC, I am completely unfamiliar with the city, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the book one bit."
4,A fun peek into more privileged lives,"I love ""nanny books,"" so I was intrigued by this new book. I read it in two days, and enjoyed it very much. I live in the DC area, so much of what she mentions is recognizable, though I certainly don't live the life of these clients! If you liked The Nanny Diaries, you'll enjoy this fun, quick read."
4,absolutle great!!,"This book is it. That is all you have to say about it. I have read a lot of books on Jeet Kune Do, Tai Chi Chung and Muay Thai, but this is the best I have ever read."
5,Devastating Critique of the Canadian Health Care System,"While some in the United States admire Canada's Single-Payer health care system, this book shows how misplaced their admiration is. In fact, Canada's system is under-funded, out-of-date and failing fast. They can't keep hold of their doctors -- or their patients. They fail to invest in new equipment or technology, and they barely perform any new research. Gratzer argues that Canada should move towards a system of medical savings accounts to restore accountability and patient power in Canada."
1,Vapid and Annoying,I suspect this book is the product of a mind trained mainly on IM. It is shallow beyond belief. I can't recall a single moment of feeling the author was sharing any observation of importance or even one when an insubstantial moment or observation was conveyed cleverly.
1,"Weak kid, Weak book","This book is about a pledge that couldn't cut it. I am sorry the author suffered through what he did in the beginning of the book, but I am sick of people whining about how terrible hazing is. Hazing is the only way fraternities can keep out the guys who aren't serious about joining. If you want to read a book that confirms your beliefs that fraternities are bad, then read this book. If you want to read a book that shows you both the good and bad of fraternities, then read Epsilon Zeta."
2,I can't wait for the book to come out.,"Wow. For a book about violence, this one sure failed to make an impression. There is death, random violence and an unwillingness by the author to speak any louder than a hazy murmur, and not in a good way. The main character is a mountain of passivity who somehow comes to decisions without a whit of reason or will. I just don't get the arc of the character... Feels like notes to novel to come."
2,Ehhhhh. Whatever.,Not my cup of tea. The first person perspective and complete absense of narration is distracting. The story is not sufficiently interesting to get the reader past that distraction. I finished it out of the hope that it would provide a satisfying payoff but it did not. I had planned on sending it to a friend who went to Clemson but on second thought I will save him from Goat.
1,Superficial and boring work,"This is meant to be an inter-disciplinary work, which should have been quite interesting. Yet, the authors here did the job in such a way that, although the book covers a wide range of matters, the treatment that any subject received is superficial. One can't obtain much insight from the book.Also, the book is written in a rather boring tone, and there is much room for improvement as regards the language. As a result, it doesn't make very easy reading, too. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone."
5,PERFECTION AT IT'S BEST!,"I originally purchased this exact bracelet on QVC, and paid almost twice the amount as the Amazon price! After wearing the original bracelet from QVC every day for 2 years without taking it off, I unfortunately got it caught in my door, and needless to say it was history. Beads were scattered about everywhere! I looked everywhere for the exact bracelet and could not find it anywhere but AMAZON!!!I finally have it back and I will never take it off again.This is a classic beauty that can be worn alone or with other bracelets. It is the sterling silver version of the PERFECT pearl bracelet!"
5,BTO rocks!,Listening to the best of BTO was a trip down memory lane.BTO was the preeminent band of the 1970's and this is a great collection.
4,Solid machine,"I have had this player for about two years now and have not had a problem with it. My kids play it constantly and the thing is built like a brick. Once fully charged, it will play for about three hours before the battery goes dead. It has been great for vacation trips. The only thing that has avoided me giving it five stars is that the little plastic hook that latches the top when it closes snapped off when I was cleaning it. Other than that, it has taken a lot of handling, traveling, and wear and tear and has kept right on working. It has been a very reliabe unit for us."
5,sweet mama!,I love it! i bought it! you should too!! hehe.. it is sweet.. MxPx does a smooth blue moon I never before heard of Billy Mccrackin but now I wanna see what he has done cos of his oh boy cover.. I reccomend it to anyone punk or just plain old.. hehe
2,"An ok cd, but not punky enough.","This cd is worth buying for the ""Blue Moon"" done by MxPx. That song is slow-fast, but rocks the chorus, and is 50's, yet sounds like 90's pop-punk too. Blue Moon also available on the out of print Australian Chick Magnet import."
3,"Not great, but good to keep in a desk drawer for a working lunch.","I bought a pack of the pad tai noodles, they have sat in my desk drawer for the last six months and I am finally on my last box. By themselves, they are completely mediocre, throw a little Asian hot sauce on them and they are pretty good. For the price they are a reasonable choice for a lunch substitute when you don't have time to run out of the office."
1,The Worse Movies of Steve Martin,"Before I see this set of the 3 movies,( DEAD MEN DONT WEAR PLAID, THE JERK AND LONELY GUY) I loved all the Steve Martin's movies I had seen, but those movies disappointment, it doesn't have nothing interesting. The topic of the 3 movies are ridiculous,boring and exaggerated.No way! I do not recommend it."
5,Swede thru the back door,"The boring and obvious meaning of the title is that the modern conceptions of sovereignty--for instance, in the us constitution, where the sole individual is the executive and the collective of representatives is the legislative-is the legacy or secularization (however that occurs) of formerly religious. The simpler argument obscures a paradox: the sovereign himself stands outside the legal order (Ordnung) that he creates. Hence: the sovereign decides on the exception, ie, what stands outside the legal order. The problem of repetition, and the state as machine (machina machinarum) is solved by the heroic creation ex nihilo of the sovereign. In Hegel's conception, the sovereign is a living, breathing human being (if only as a figurehead) because there exists always the possibility of a life and death struggle."
5,Oh Holy Panda Bear!,"Let me be blunt. The Panda Bear album was sent from God. Whoever you are Mr. Panda Bear Sir, I know exactly what you're saying. And I can't understand half of your lyrics.I listen to it everyday. Panda Bear is completely in tune with it. This album will scramble your brain, and garnish it with sweet soothing revelations. Makes me feel like I belong. The words are quite irrelevant, me and a very good friend agreed.The artwork is the full expression of the sound as well.If you will all now turn in your hymnals to page 420 and stand as we sing ""Bros."" by Panda Bear."
3,Collect this part,"3 1/2Though occasionally showing a nasty skeletal underside of hazy ramblings, PP is mostly an enthralling session of organically progressive ambiance."
2,"Great in critical sense, but clash in personal preference","Person Pitch is the first solo effort by Animal Collective member Panda Bear. While containing many interesting conepts and fresh ideas, I could never find myself truly enjoying the album. After several re-listenings my confusion only grew; I felt left out of the circle. I don't discourage you from buying this album, I just caution you to borrow it from a friend first. If you are like myself, it might not be the experience you had conjured in your mind. Save some cash, give it a listen, and if you love it by all means buy it."
5,Previn plays Gershwin from Broadway,"This is one of a number of CDs that André Previn has made playing tunes from the great American songbook. For some of these he has recorded as soloist. For other CDs he has other jazz players accompanying him. Here he is partnered by David Finck on double bass for 14 glorious Gershwin tunes. We start with a really swinging arrangement of `They all laughed'. We then slow the tempo for a delightful arrangement of `Someone to watch over me' that obviously owes much to Oscar Peterson. We have an up-tempo `Lady be good' and `A foggy day' that has something of the Jacques Loussier touch about it. Next we are treated to a skilful medley of `Soon' and `Do it again'; then into `I got rhythm', `Embraceable you', `Fascinating rhythm, `Love walked in', `The man I love' and still more. It's all `S'wonderful'."
1,Pretty much worthless.,"I understand very basic vietnamese. Being vietnamese-american I can understand and basic conversational vietnamese. Writing no so much.With that said, I find this book worthless.Honestly at one point i wondered if this should have come with an audio cd.Not worth the paper its printed on."
1,Do not buy from amazon,"I ordered 200 of these discs because the price was very cheap and it came with free shipping. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and there were 200 loose discs in the box. There was no case holding the discs, someone just ESTIMATED 200 discs, threw them into a cardboard box, threw some bubble wrap on top, slapped my name/address on the box and shipped it out. When I collected the cd's, most of them had debris on it and/or were scratched from rubbing against each other and from dust/dirt in the box."
5,A Small Act- big waves,"""A Small Act"" is a compelling documentary which highlights not only the importance of education and working hard but how small acts of kindness can have a wave even tsunami effect - power of one. A must see for all who belong to the human race."
2,Contains: Sulfuric acid < 1%,"The fine print on the bottle states ""Contains: Sulfuric acid < 1%."" This product is not particularly useful as sulfuric acid. One of the features suggests that this product is only useful for ""testing levels in your spa or pool."" If you were hoping to use this for anything else, then look elsewhere."
3,Average Bowl of Rice,"Taste was a bit bland, but easy to make. So if you are looking for an easy to make, ok tasting rice bowl.. You have it here. Nothing really special, but it is filling and cheap."
3,Entertaining but hoping the main girl would get eaten,"It wasn't too bad for a B movie and was even moderately entertaining. However, the actress who played Carol was very annoying. She looked rather awkward and seemed to be a bit old to run around in skimpy shorts and bikini tops. Don't get me wrong I get the movie is full of bad acting and girls in swimsuits but the character of Carol was older and suppose to be a respected researcher and dressed like a teenager....so yea pretty awkward. The way she spoke was rather annoying too. I could have done without seeing the lead male actor's plumbers crack when he jumped down to the lower level of the boat...but this isn't a high quality movie and I tend to be forgiving when mutated monsters attack. This isn't one of the better monster movies I have seen so I would only recommed it if you have a mutated monster addiction.And do not expect alot of extras on the DVD. You pretty much get scene selection and trailer for the movie."
2,Do Not Make The Cheesecake,"I've only tried the chocolate/peanut butter cheesecake, and I'm sure some of the other recipes are great, but, for the cheesecake, I followed the recipe exactly and got a brownie-esque ""cheesecake"" that was completely inedible because of the TWO POUNDS of unsweetened and bitter chocolate that the recipe called for (this seemed a bit weird to me, but I trusted the recipe). I couldn't even taste the peanut butter. I doubt they tested the recipe, because it just doesn't work at all, and I'm frankly a little scared to try any other recipes. If anyone had a different experience and somehow managed to make edible cheesecake, then please comment, because I'd like to know how that happened."
3,All too plausible,"Lane has a talent for displaying the very worst of his characters with a single well-chosen phrase, and in DUTY he gives us a panoply of ""subhuman"" enlisted men and stiff martinets in the officer class, all trying to retire with more brass and retirement funds than anyone else. Indeed the whole system seems absurd in Lane's cosmos, a Navy without a purpose, a Navy emasculated by successive runs of job cuts and budget reductions and, although this isn't as clear, too much ""peace."" The way he pictures the Navy, it's almost as though only a nut would join. The plot runs smoothly enough, though I didn't enjoy the ""red herring"" factor of the two brothers who happened to be staying, in their underwear, in the apartment of the Petty Officer accused of being gay. What was that all about? Didn't Chekhov say, where there's smoke, there's got to be at least a little bit of fire?"
3,The Pictures are Wonderful,"I just reread this book today, it had been a long time since I read it. I got this book when I was about 8 years old, and then I probably would have given the book 5 stars. However, now that I'm 22 years old I'm not as enchanted with it, but it is illustrated beautifully. I think children would really like it."
5,An easy to read practical guide to customer clubs & loyalty,"Most new books on loyalty programs skip over basic customer program development. They present loyalty marketing in an academic format full of mathematical formuls which are rarely, if ever, used by a company. This is not to say the visual presentation of Mr. Butscher's solid advice and guidance is left to the reader, but it is not force-feed.Read this practical guide prior to reviewing your current loyalty program or developing a new program.Not every frequency marketing issue is covered in depth but how many of your employees will care? This book can be understood and enjoyed by anyone who knows they should be addressing loyalty marketing, but get lost in the details. Enjoy !"
3,ANNOYING SILICONE TIPS,"Well if it wasn't for the sound quality I would to tally love this but I have lost two tips in a period of 5 weeks, yes Bose do replace them and send you a new set, but it upsets me to see how easy it is to loose this tips and without them it is so uncomfortable to use them, I'm going to try to glue them or something"
1,"Mozez, So Still.","Personally, I didn't care for this CD. There are two songs I liked and that was it. I liked him much better in Zero 7."
3,A Great Action Figure,"Samurai Spawn IS the most visually dynamic action figure ever created! The detail on this dude cannot be matched by any other toy! Finnally we get an extremely detailed McFarlane toy that also has great articulation! Although the toy is ment more to be looked at, it is still fun to play with."
2,Good one time mask,This mask was good for halloween this year but is not very durable and was actually slightly ripped when we recieved it so it was shipped with not much care. I would reccomend as a one time use option but would have prefered something more durable.
1,Good customer service,"Just wanted to say ""thanks"" for the great customer service from Julie at WS. I had an issue with the mask I ordered and wrote a review about it. I didn't expect to hear from anyone but got a call the next day and they did everything to make it right again. Excellent customer service and follow up.Thanks."
4,Actual breastfeeding pillow,"Like most things related to breastfeeding, this one takes some getting used to, especially if you've used other 'pillows' before. I had - like most of American women I think - registered for and received a ""boppy"" brand pillow, never realizing it isn't ""made"" for breastfeeding, and not knowing what features I really needed in a breastfeeding pillow. So after two babies with ""boppys"" - I ditched the ne'er successful boppy pillow at a yardsale and upgraded to this pillow for our third child. I could rave all day about the features I like, but it does boil down to the function and purpose of this pillow is to assist with breastfeeding. That's what it's supposed to do, and that's what it does. The cover is very soft, straps adjustable and like how easy the cover zips off for cleaning. Highly recommend if you plan on breastfeeding."
1,Wore out in 4 months of use!,"Tried this on a Wrangler Rubicon with 4"" Lift and 33"" x 12.5"" tires. Fixed steering wobble immediately but wore out in 4 months of use."
5,"Corning Ware 8pc Pop-Ins, Bake and Serve Set","Corning Ware, so well made, and microwaveable including the tops. Goes from the refrigerator to the Microwave. What a time saver and lack of dishes to wash."
1,Cartridge prints green for yellow,The yellow ink cell is apparently contaminated with blue ink. The cartridge prints way too dark. When I run nozzle check on the printer the yellow comes out an odd green color.
2,Compatibility problems...,"Most efficient and fasted defrager there is, no doubt. But when I used this as my defrager and continued using Norton Utilities -it crashed my system and I had to reformat my hard drive so access it again. The problems occurred when I would use Nortons System and Windows Repair functions in conjunction with Diskeeper 6.0. I unloaded it and sold it to a friend who doesn't use Norton Utilities and just wanted an upgraded defrag tool."
3,"Could have been written by ""Derek Grenoble""",My first time to read this author. I was intrigued by the plot. It was a little light reading...............would have enjoyed it more if Jack could have a found a more age-appropriate love interest...............maybe this author's audience is mostly male.
3,"As Comic Mystery Writers Go, Not the Best, Not the Worst","Being a fan of Terry Pratchett, I thought I'd try Carl Hiassen, whom reviewers often compare with Pratchett. While this was a reasonably good mystery with a likeable central character, I couldn't see any comparison to Pratchett, whose wit and human understanding are miles ahead of Hiassen's. Perhaps this is one of Hiassen's weaker novels, or maybe--since I grew up in Miami and found it an atrocious city with the most miserable climate in the U.S.--I just don't relate to South Florida. Never could read those Travis McGee mysteries either."
3,Average,"I have read nearly all of Carl Hiaasen's books and I have found that he is becoming less humourous as time goes on. His first few books were brilliant black comedy but since then they have taken a decided turn for the worse.I found Sick Puppy was terrible and unreadable.Fortunately, Basket Case is a superior product. Not much humour in it and more mystery but at least it was readable.I miss the old Hiaasen books......."
3,"Lukewarm to me, may be your favorite.","This was fine, but what's the point? Who wants to read a ""fine"" book anyways? Basket Case is well-enough written, has interesting enough characters, splashy settings, blah, blah, blah. It just didn't click for me. I wandered through the story thinking ""oh, that's interesting, but so what""? The humor wasn't that funny, the plot twists that stunning. Hiaasen' style just is not my cup of tea. I read one of his earlier books on the recommendation of a friend, Sick Puppy (that's the books name, not the friend). I had the same reaction; well-enough written, sort of funny but just not my type, not compelling. I respect him enough as a pop fiction writer but Hiaasen will never be a writer that I anxiously await his next offering.There are plenty of other great reviews that I've read that lead me to suggest that you pick up a copy of Basket Case. You may find it hits your spot. It just missed mine."
3,fun but few belly laughs,"I love Carl Hiaasen and have read most of his books. They are perfect when you need a pick me up -- something fun, but with some substance and punch as well.""Basket Case"" is entertaining, but most of it's vitriol and scathing humor is focused on the corporatization of journalism, with dramatically devastating results in terms of quality and public service. As usual, Hiaasen makes some important points, and clearly his close up and personal experience are reflected in the plot.This is a good plane, pool, or beach book. The reader should be forewarned, however, that it lacks the same degree of righteous mockery (though not the mockery) of most of Hiaasen's other novels."
2,Slow Moving and Predictable,"I usually love this authors books, however, this one was predictable and slow. I really had to force myself to keep reading til the end. There were times I skipped pages just to finish. The plot is interesting but, It seems to be over written. I did like the singers sister, Jacks romance with his editor and Jacks obessesion with death. The frozen lizard was funny too."
1,Maxell Disc,"This product looked good;In fact, it appeared almost identical to the last disc cleaner I bought (which worked well for years). However, it is total crap. The stupid thing doesn't want to turn once you've closed the lid. It will turn fine while you have it open, and are checking to make sure nothing is wrong. However, once you close it, the stupid thing won't work."
1,Peacock Suncatcher panel,"Poor packaging has resulted in this product being returned twice due to excessive breakage. The first panel we sent back we asked for a replacement, which arrived in the same condition as the first panel. This panel was also returned with a request for refund. We received a dragonfly suncatcher that had been packaged in three boxes with sufficient bubblewrap to eliminate a great portion of glass breakage."
3,"Beautiful, although cracked","My panel was also cracked in several places, but the panel is so beautiful, I just used glass glue to secure the pieces and will hang it soon. Considering the price of the piece, I believe that it was worth the money. I would certainly buy it again."
5,Stained glass peacock,"I am very pleased with my stained glass peacock, I have it hanging over a window and it catches the light every day, it is really beautiful."
2,Meh Another Self Help Book,"I was looking for a more practical guide on preparing for surgery like foods that are good to eat to get your body ready, exercise you can do before and after surgery...that kind of stuff. I wasn't really looking for another self help book about positive thoughts, vibes, and visualizations. This book should have a different title."
1,Prepare for Surgery Heal Faster by Peggy Huddleston,The book is not worth much without the video tape it talks about throughout the book. This tape is a tape to help a person relax and basically meditate. Consequently the book needs the tape too.
2,Didn't Help,"I bought this before major surgery last year and it didnt help. It was annoying to me. Better just to deal with your surgery head on, be knowledgeable about it and strong. You are only prolonging any fears and worries by trying to read these type of books and listening to unrealistic audio tapes. Buy yourself a good piece of chocolate cake after your surgery for going through it!"
2,Worked for a while then broke,"I used it for a month or so then one time I used it and it registered over 20 psi without even 1 psi in my tank. Don't buy it, it is bad quality and will break in a short time with repeated use."
1,1/4th Star should be a rating option,"This is what happens when you get a bunch of wanna be Industrial musicians together and ask them to cover songs of Industrial Gods.Granted some of the artists on here are the real deal such as Mark Spybey, but then you got a bunch of Euro dance dorks such as Spahn Ranch, Electric Hellfire Club, and the like who don't even deserve to have a stab at a project such as this.What the heck happen, did Britney Spears' manager get the rights to Skinny Puppy intellectual property and decide it would be a good idea to collect the worst Industrial Spin off bands together and make a Skinny Puppy tribute album?!?!?Actually a Britney Spears or NSYNC version might actually be an improvement.Buy this USED, only if it is a must have for your collection. The Dead Voices On Air and the Download Track are worth the $1.60 at least."
3,"if you love skinny puppy, you'll hate this","A little background: This cd ended up on my computer. I listened to it, was disgusted, gave it a few more tries since i was bored, and deleted everything but dead of winter.A good skinny puppy cover is like a cold fusion reactor, or a good doors cover. As of yet, none have been made. While it is interesting to hear download download itself, it is not very memorable to hear a progeny of spinoff bands attempt to improve upon their sole source of inspiration. What is produced is a lot of mumbling and structureless atonal mush, lacking the visceral emotion and entrancing rhythm that we have come to adore.For an industrial cd, that merits no stars. For this cd compared to any other cd, including linkin park, three stars."
4,VERY INTERESTING,"This definately a different take on some old favorites. Front Line Assembly covers one of the songs from the original Back & Forth Series 1. Probably the best tracks on it are Electric Hellfire Club's cover of Worlock with lotsa Charlie Manson samples, The Element's cover of The Choke, and Razed In Black's take on Assimilate.This is not a Skinny Puppy album. Don't expect the classics as you know them, but it is interesting and is worth the money if you are obsessed with Puppy."
4,Great,"Roedelius, one of the leaders of German minimalist music for more than 20 years now again keeps us on our toes with this latest offering. It contains a series of mixes and re-mixes by people such as alex Patterson (The Orb) that will delight everybody. Especially excellent is track number 4 that is really exciting electronica at its experimental best."
1,Painful earbuds,"I bought these Maxell Ear Buds several months ago and I just wasted my money. They are painful to wear if you wear them for a long period of time. They are just poorly design and not made for every ear hole. If you have small ears or even medium size ears, you may find them painful to wear for a period of time. Don't waste your money and move on and find something else. Thumbs down from me!"
2,Poor design,"These earbuds are too big to fit ears. They don't rest comfortably on the outside, either. The material is hard, and they have fallen out of my ears several times. Sound quality would be fine if they would stay in my ears (I'm only sitting at my desk). I would not recommend this particular model. I've had other Maxell in the past (different design) with no issues."
1,Disappointed,For the first month it worked great. After a month the heart rate monitor would not read my heart rate properly. After 3 months the watch got stuck and now this thing is worthless.
2,Low credibility for this company,"Before buying this product, click on [...] in order to review the manual. Fortunately I did, and I decided not to buy. I had sent them an e-mail with questions, and their answers were all ""yes"". Wrong! In discovering the manual, and thus discovering that I had been vastly misinformed with all these ""yes"" answers, I contacted them again for clarification. No response! Bottom line: I wouldn't do business with a company I don't feel I can trust."
2,Try another book for MCSE IIS Exam,Don't rely on this book to take this exam. Questions in this book not really same as the real exam. Get online documentation from Microsoft instead.
5,BEST CD OF 1999,"I first saw the Sadies outside of a bar after a hockey game in downtown Nashville. I bought their cd as soon as I could and I've been listening to it ever since. This is the most schizophrenic mix of surf, hillbilly, punk, garage and psychobilly that I've ever heard and I really dig it. Everyone I played this for can't believe that the same band is doing such a diverse mix of songs. I am reminded of the La's cd where every song on the cd was different. VIVA LA DIFFERENCE !"
5,Palm Trees swaying,"Loved the design of these dishes. Had previously purchased Corelle dishes and was pleased with them, but got bored with the design. These dishes enhance our lifestyle."
3,Corelle Banmoo Leaf Dishes,"I love the shape and strength of Corelle. However, the quality control was poor.Many of the dishes were mis-shapen at the edges and a few had a color transferto the bottom of the dishes from the color on the front of the dishes."
2,Better Have Good Vision for This One!,"This book is potentially of great value to serious Bible students, but I couldn't read it, even with a magnifying lens. At such a reasonable price, it's not worth the cost of sending it back, so I'm keeping it for now, but may one day pass it on to someone with excellent vision!"
1,Not what I expected,"Received the shipment on-time, but the first thing I noticed when opening the box were the words ""not for laptop use"" written on the package. There was no mention anywhere in the specs or description of this item on the site that said it was only for laptops, so since I only have a laptop, I have now needlessly purchased a product I cannot use."
1,Didn't do the trick,I don't know. I followed instructions but the cleaning didn't really make a difference. It was supposed to eliminate skips. Vendor shipped promptly.
2,Maybe I expected too much?,"I was very excited about the prospect of silicone bakeware. Silicone seems to be the wonder material of the 21st century, yet, I have been disappointed with the results. The tube pan is very bendy and when I giggled it a bit to see if my cake was loose enough to remove, I wound up with a crack right down the middle. When I got my cake out of the pan (easily), the center was as white as when it went in the oven. I'm used to having the centers brown up with my regular tube pan.I've used other silicone bakeware and have had varying degrees of success depending on what I bake in them. Buyers beware!"
4,This is a Disney Keepsake. Procelain Doll that shows a beautiful little African Girl in native dress.,Disney Small world Doll is porcelain and is a collectible suitable for ages 8 and up. Lovely girl with dark skin and authentic Native African Costume.
1,disappointed,"the thread count & softness of the sheets met my expectations, however the top sheet was the wrong size, it did not even fit across my queen size bed. I had to return them.The holidays are coming up and I am very reluctant to shop Amazon.com. I was previously a happy customer."
4,Evenflo Big Kid Booster Seat Family Pk - Cornerstone - Family 2 pack,"This is a great way to sell these booster seats, as a family pack! Besides being a great safety item for my older kids,I love the side compartment as well as the drink holders. Both of my kids thought that the two added extras were just fantistic. Delivery time frame was so easy and quick.I am very pleased with my purchase in everyway!"
5,Best VHS tape ever !,"I had about given up hope on my VHS recorder because the tapes just were not turning out right. I finally tried a DRY cleaner vs. wet and this first quality tape. It is worth the price, every recording I have made has been perfect and I have re-recored over the tape a dozen times. Before you give up on your old machine try this tape !"
2,MAXELL T-160HG High Grade VHS Video Cassette,One of the cassettes spit up a hairball and began to drag; I had to rewind it on another VCR. Seems OK now.
5,Surprisingly GREAT!,"My daughter *loves* this book. I didn't think she would not like it per say, but I didn't realize she would enjoy it to the extent that she does. It is little, perfect for her little hands to hold. Plus, it is a picture of birds from various pieces of art. It is a beautiful little book. I highly recommend it."
1,not so good,don't but it.not so good not so good not so good. I did not like it this is just my opinion but i didn't like it.
5,Wonderful,"I was a little nervous about buying this because my cassette deck has auto-reverse, but after receiving it and using it during my 2 hour commute I must say that I am very pleased. This is a good cassette adapter for anyone that is looking for a cassette adapter that works with a auto-reverse cassette deck."
3,Adequate Adapter,"I purchased this to listen to podcasts off my BlackBerry Curve 8330 (Sprint). I have found that the sound quality varies from podcast to podcast due to the level of compression used. Generally I turn my BlackBerry up to full volume and almost do the same in my car stereo. The sound quality is ok - it is a cassette after all. The cord is not very thick so you need to be careful not to snap it or pull on it roughly. I might try another adapter to see if there is any difference in sound quality.Also, the Dolby noise reduction is a must, otherwise you will get a lot of hissing. I would say overall the purchase was positive, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high."
4,Great Intro To Multiple Sports!,An excellent array of DVDs covering four sports.Parents looking for good fundamentals and drills will enjoythis product for their kids.Marty Schupak also produced these popular DVDs available on Amazon.Baseball Coaching:The 59 Minute Baseball PracticeFor Little League coaches & parents.Soccer Coaching:Championship Soccer DrillsFor soccer coaches & parents.Basketball Coaching:48 Championship Basketball DrillsFor youth & school basketball coaches & parents.
4,research book,I bought this book to help with my thesis research as the library offerings were slim. Excellent research help as i used it as a reference.
1,Maxell clear jewel cases,"These cases are not suitable to replace broken clear jewel cases because there's an area of ridges along the left side that obscures the artwork, and the tray where the CD sits is made of frosted plastic, which also obscures the artwork. The jewel cases I received are not the same as those pictured in the Amazon listing. They are also made of very thin plastic and feel flimsy. They definitely aren't ""...superior in quality, manufactured and designed to exceed the industry standards,"" as the Amazon listing states."
5,A MUST for yourself and All your girlfriends!,"Jesus Calling is a treasure. I have had it for four years and each day it becomes more meaningful.I give it to all my girlfriends, that way you know that you are all reading God's Word together each day.Jesus Calling speaks to your heart, mind and soul."
5,Jesus calling,I've never felt the Presence of Jesus to be so real as I have since I started reading this book.
5,A very good devotional,This devotional is a very good pause for any time of day. It leaves you thinking and looking toward Jesus.
5,So very comforting,"The writer has a finely honed understanding of our Lord. This devotional touches in a way I've rarely been touched, especially in a daily devotional."
5,Jesus Calling,My wife had this book and I liked it so much I downloaded onto my Kindle. Now I can have these short devotionals with me where ever I go. I find her writings to be theologically sound and written in a practical and to the point style. The style is good and I am moved spiritually by the messages.rayme
5,Amazing,I have really enjoyed this book! Make sure you read the introduction. It really helps you appreciate the contents even more. Every day that I read an entry I continue to be amazed at how applicable it is to me that day. I am grateful to God for using Sarah Young in this way.
5,speaks to my heart,"I had a friend recommend this devotional. I read of few passages, and decided to get one. this one is really different from other devotionals in that it speaks as though Jesus is talking to the reader. then has scripture reading suggestions along with room to write your own thoughts. i would recommend it."
2,jesus calling,very disappointed...sorry I bought it. Thought it would be like God Calling..........i will not be using it...looking for something else
5,Jesus calling devotional by Sarah young,"This daily devotional is great. Each daily reading is like a big 'hug' from Jesus. Relevant bible versus support the days reading. Liked it so much, bought one for each of my friends for Christmas!"
5,Excellent! Well Done!,This is a well written devotional. I would highly recommend it. In fact I did this past Sunday from the pulpit. It is short and powerful start to the day.
1,Channeling Jesus,"This book was recommended by a fellow church member. I purchased a few copies to give to people, but I hadn't read it myself. I do believe that there should be a didactic relationship with the Lord, but this author seems to go to a mystical level that appears to have little to do with God's Word and a lot to do with the prodcution of redundant gibberish."
1,False,God speaks through His Word. Not through the thoughts of others. Avoid such books and read the Bible itself. You cannot go wrong.
3,book is great service terrible,the book arrived on 1/20/13. i had a promised date of 12/27/12 . i did not mind a couple of days after christmas but 20 + days being late is not what i was told or expected.
3,Miss the verses printed out individually this year comparted to last.,Miss the versed printed out individually like last years please let me know why in my kindle it has theblank pages in between days like the verses are suppose to be there. thanks
5,very satisfied,"I fimd the peace of God on every page of this devotional. The readings fill me with hope and simply communicate Gods Love, and guidance, along with scripture references at the bottom of each page. I gave two more as christmas gifts. It is a gift that keeps giving throughout the year."
5,Most inspirational devotional book I have ever owned.,This devotional seems to speak to me every day. It is like Jesus is there in the room. It's the best one I have ever owned. I have given it as a gift to many of my family members and friends especially the ones that are going through difficult illnesses.
5,Life changing book!,This book has literally changed my life! I have read it over and over and it still inspires me and has helped me find a closer relationship with God. I have given the book as gifts to several friends and family. My mother and brother also love the book and said it has changed their lives too. We often talk on the phone about the daily devotion and it has helped us through hard times. Reading it in the morning helps me focus on what is important. This is my favorite book ever! Thank you Sara Young!
5,Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence,"I've been reading this devotional for five years. It is absolutely the best I've ever read. It has helped me through the most diffulcult time in my life. It has blessed and encouraged me each day. As the Holy Spirit has led, I've given dozens away in the past four years, and the recipients have done the same."
5,Inspirational Devotion,This is one of the best inspirational devotionals ever written. Reading each day is like having divine words of truth spoken directly to you everyday. Many have agreed that the messages fit everyday life experiences.
1,This book worries me.,"I love Jesus Christ. I long for deeper communion with Christ. I long for all people to have deep communion with Christ. I believe God has given us His Word so we can do this. God has ""once for all"" delivered the faith to us (Jude 3). Sarah Young says she is speaking Jesus' Word. She might not believe her words are inspired (and I believe her) but she still says her words are Jesus' messages. This cuts to the core of the sufficiency of the Bible. God's Word is sufficiency. Let us read that and find the sweet words of our Christ there! Grace and peace to you all."
5,Jeanjo,A wonderful way to start the day. Was recommended to me by a friend who is using it again for the third year in a row. Scripture and short devotional always seem relevant to where I am in my life each day. Highly recommend to anyone who only has about ten minutes each morning for devotional time.Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence
5,Great book!,"This is a great book, all should read it. Every day there is a paragraph to read along with some Bible texts, and each one is so powerful! It has been a blessing to me and to many others as everyone I buy this for ends up buying more to give away to others also."
5,Excellent devotion,"I use this book daily in the mornings to start my day. I feel it brings Jesus to me every morning and helps me to focus on a better relationship with God and set my priorities in order.I also think this book helps me to think about my relationship with other people and how I treat them. I use this book along with the""Jesus Calling Devotional Bible"". Love it !!!"
5,Inspirational,I read this book everyday and I love it. It helps me keep and maintain my faith with our Creator.
5,Jesus Calling,This book has daily readings. I have never encountered a book that so tenderly communicates Jesus' love and care for us. I have bought it as gifts for friends and family because I have gained such a wonderful new perspective of His great love for us.
5,Just what I needed!,Loved it. Helps me through my day and starts my morning in a total God space. Can't wait for her next book.
4,A good guide for everyday living.,This book shows how much we are loved by Jesus. It is a constant reminder that God is with us always. It helps to build us up and to show each of us that we matter and we are precious in God's sight.
5,Jesus Calling touches your heart,Jesus Calling sweetly connects you to the heart of Jesus as he encourages you in your daily walk. His affirming words start your day on the perfect note to feel his love and his peace in your life. This small devotional book makes an ideal gift to pass along to anyone wanting to experience a personal connection with the Lord in their lives. Fresh and inspiring every day!
5,excellent devotional book,This is by far my most favorite devotional book. I have given away 40+. Wonderful and inspirational.
5,Jesus Calling,EXCELLANT ! My daily devotional. When I don't read this for a day I think I missed out on something. Keeps me coming back everyday for my uplifting message. Bought several as gifts.
4,Inspiring,"Although it's a small book, it has a great and inspiring effect. This devotional book is definitely an important book to have and read everyday. Since the daily messages are short, you can read it easily throughout the day. It is inspirational, encouraging and peaceful....and has blessed me in my spiritual walk."
5,Excellence!,"I recently purchased Sarah Young's ""Jesus Calling"" book as a gift because I had received it as a gift and have found it extremely helpful and insightful. Ever since I received this devotional book, I have been reading it daily which has inspired me to spend time in the presence of the Lord. Also, I look up the scripture references and hear the Lord speaking to me. Thus, I would highly recommend this book."
5,JESUS CALLING,MY HUSBAND AND I READ IT EVERYDAY. IT IS A GREAT INSPIRATION! I BOUGHT IT FOR MY FRIEND WHEN SHE QUIT HER JOB AND SHE SAID IT HAS HELPED HER DEAL WITH DAY TO DAY STRUGGLES. GOING TO BUY MORE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. DEFINITELY A 5 STAR BOOK!
5,Jesus Calling,This is the best devotional I've ever read. I have given it to many of my friends going through difficult times or experiencing a loss. I highly recommend this book.
5,Rich and Spiritually fulfilling,This daily meditation is a good blessing to help start your day. The meditations help to remind me and help me to continue opening myself up to the presence of God. I have given it as gifts and will order more.
5,Best devotional ever,"This book was a gift from a friend during my unemployment. I have read daily devotionals for years. This is the best one I've ever read. It's written in first person, from God to us, scripture based with references for each devotion. Each day is a reminder to embrace God and draw near to Him and it consistently reminds the reader of His love for us. It's truly an inspirational devotional that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys spending time alone with God. I have since paid it forward and given the book as a gift to many friends going through trials and looking for God's will in their life during their suffering."
5,Jesus Calling,Absolutly wonderful! It's as though Jesus speaks to me personally each morning. I am not such a fan of daily devotionals but this is the exception. I highly recommend it.
5,Loving Jesus,Jesus Calling is one of the best devotionals I've ever read. The Lord uses this book to speak to me. I am thankful I bought the book.
5,Jesus Calling Enjoying peace in His Presence,"This book is wonderful. I have it on CD, in my IPOD, a hard copy, and on my nook. Plus I have purchased a copy for a few friends, my sister, mother and nieces, brother in law and step father. It is such an up lifting book.Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence"
5,Great truths to read daily.,"After reading this book daily for over a week, I would highly recommend this book. I love the fact that Sarah Young chose to write this book as if Jesus himself were speaking to me. A wonderful daily reminder of how intimate my heavenly father is and desires deep relationship with me."
5,Lifts Me Up,"This beautiful devotional has brought me through a difficult period of recovery from illness. It lifts me up and keeps me focused on the Lord. It seems to speak directly to me. Through the daily readings and re-readings, I find joy and strength in the Lord. This little book has given me so much courage and reassurance that our Lord loves us and guides us daily."
5,Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace In His Presence,This is the best Christian daily reading that I have seen. I have already determined that I am going to go through it again next year.
1,Don't buy this product,"The quality is so low, rather spend couple more dollars and buy another product.I will not recommended it to anyone."
5,Centerfold is tops,"If you like smoothe bodies this CD is for you. Somewhat sensual, this CD employs beautiful models who show it all. Beautifully filmed, but only shows a few models. Long shots on uninteresting positions of the models weakens the erotic value here. It is what is claims to be--centerfolds."
1,No Monakeys!,"No, No No! No monakeys here! Makes me Heep and scream. You see the digital dashboards--laugh in the back. Why do yo ask? Why is there why, or why equals how. That's it now! With the program, you are unstoppable. Not to forget the web power of cling. Yes Yes Yes!! Take that away though, you have monakeys with apebates. Take care of those socks."
5,Love this moisturiser!,"I used to always use a moisturiser by Avon that contained sea minerals, but then they discontinued it, so I was really glad to discover this moisturiser and it's a bonus that it has SPF so I know my face is protected. I also like the fact that it is natural. It smells amazing, sinks in nicely and leaves my skin velvety soft. It also wears well under make-up. I would definitely recommend this to everyone."
1,Icon 740 Headphone with volume switch,I used the headphone for two days and the ear protector ripped. I was very unhappy with this purchased
4,Good External Drive,"This drive has plenty of capacity for home use. I found the software very simple to install and back-up/retrieval very simple to do. I like that the software has an automatic back-up function, which means I don't have to manage the back-ups. The only draw back is that it is not powered from the USB connection alone and needs to be plugged into the wall."
4,Overall a good magazine,Overall I like equus. Some issues are better than others. I don't believe everything I read anywhere. But that being said it is fairly well done and educational and not just sales pitches and pretty pictures.We are a medical family and sometimes I question some recommendations. But overall I find it educational and informative.
1,Damaged slippers received and returned,"This was to be my third new pair in less than three years. Previous pairs arrived in new condition.The latest purchase arrived in damaged condition. I would call them ""seconds.""I returned them for a full refund.I was very disappointed because I hoped to own perfectly new slippers at a good price."
2,Cheap Soles,"I bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas time. I thought if Ispent $50 on slippers they would last a long time, and be made very well.I was wrong. The slippers look good, and the upper leather is very nicebut the sole is a cheap, thin foam. If you bend it, it snaps. You wouldexpect to find this on a cheap, $2 flip flop. I was very disappointed. I bought my husband a cheap $2 pair of suede slippers in Walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole."
5,"BEST SLIPPERS, A REPEAT CUSTOMER","I have worn these type slippers for years, never tire of them, they arrived as promised! no cons for this product, They hold up for years. I recommend them to guys who want comfort."
3,Um...,These are good eppi's but why is this DVD so freakin expensive!?!? ONLY this one is so much! WHY?!I own all of them except this one...so depressing. Even ebay and barnes&nobles; has this volume listed as a higher price than the others...why?
5,excellent music,"This album's cohesive theme is the best Loud Family yet. It reminds me more of the old Game Theory, (Scott Miller's original band). The tempo changes are the best!"
2,"Easy to use, cleaned the player - but CD's still skip.","Easy to use, cleaned the CD player - but the CDs still skip.Ordering a CD cleaner next. Sigh...the CD's are borrowed from the libary -so maybe they are in really bad shape? Worked for most I guess..."
5,I never thought I'd live to see the day.....,"...I look forward to shaving. This is a most delightful experience! (This comment comes from a rather negative person who can find fault with just about anything.) I read about this stuff in the Chicago Tribune many months ago when they did a comparison of new shaving products for men. I finally decided to try it.I have very sensitive skin and have been nicking myself daily since the day I learned to shave. Delivery system is a blue tube instead of a can and product comes out looking like a cream but turns into a colorless oil when applied to the face. The razor glides right over the skin and feels great! I can shave right over my face, adam's apple and chin without any nicks. Face is so smooth! Although pricey at $15 a tube, I feel it's well worth it."
4,So cute!,"Very official looking. My son has not actually worn it yet, but will for Halloween this year. The suit is thin enough that if it's hot, he will be fine - and big enough that if he needs to wear something under it, he can.Can't wait!"
5,Perfect for young kids,"This is the perfect costume for young kids who have no idea what they are wearing. I had my boy in a giraffe costume last year and he hated how hot the costume got. This outfit is perfect for running around in doors. As far as my boy was concerned, this was just another outfit."
5,Best Costume Ever!,"My 19 month old looks absolutely adorable in his NASA Astronaut costume! It's exactly what I was looking for... Something lightweight, easy to get on (1-piece zippered jumpsuit), unique design - haven't seen too many astronauts out there, good quality and comfortable. I bought the 18 mos size since my son is only 24lbs but over 33"" and it fit him perfectly. Plus, the orange color catches his attention and the pants easily snap open for diaper changes. I love it!"
1,Disappointed,"Didn't not understand that the helmet was a separate item, almost as expensive as the suit. It is not clear in the descriptions and the pictures include the helmet.Very disappointed."
5,very good quality,"This is a very high-quality astronaut suit with hat. We were very impressed, as was our 4-year-old daughter. I would recommend buying a little big, though: our daughter wears about a size 5 but the size 6-8 fits her pretty well with some room to grow. Great deal"
4,Better than expected quality,"Nice sturdy construction, better than expected. SIze runs a bit bigger than you might expect."
5,Best cream I have ever used.,"I have oily skin and this cream is the best I have ever used. It's not greasy, but moisturizes nicely, smells great and I love everything about it."
4,Good for Summer time,"My dermatologist recommended this line for my very sensitive skin. I bought both this and the night cream based on the other reviews I read. This one is very nice, but not quite thick and creamy enough for me at this time of year. I think I will probably use it more in the summer. I am keeping it though. The smell is very strong -- that threw me off a bit at first because I am also very sensitive to smells. My husband thinks it smells manly -- I disagree, I think it smells fresh and clean. Bottom line is it is a strong smell. If you are allergic to strong smells, you may want to try a different product."
2,'We Reach:The Music Of The Melvins' - Various Artists (Fractured) 2 1/2 stars,"Okay,I'm a casual fan of tribute CD releases.But,this one of the Melvin's repertoire is 'okay'.Total of eighteen cuts.Features bands like Mare,Pig Destoyer,High On Fire,Dog Fashion Disco among others I've never even remotely heard of before paying tribute to Buzz Osbourne(no relation)and crew.One good thing about 'We Reach...' is that it'll simply have most fans craving to hear the original versions of these songs."
5,Hot In Cleveland,"Best show on television. Watched season 1 and 2 on Netflix, came to Amazon for Season three. a must see."
5,Super Funny!,"This show is SOOO funny! My Mom and I watch this together, we joy it so much. We have all three season, hilarious!"
2,It Strikes Out!,"If you really want the scoop on B'way shows, look for a couple other titles by the same author: ""Opening Nights on Broadway"", and it's companion, ""More Opening Nights on Broadway"". They're far better. What's missing in this book is all the great detail at a glance: Opening night date/year, length of run, original cast listing and snippets of numerous reviews by the major critics and publications, as well as a paragraph or two of interesting trivia. ""Second Act Trouble"" is limited to little more than a couple dozen shows in as many chapters each made up of long narrative, as opposed to the reference guide-style of the two other works mentioned above."
5,Excellent music videos,I used to watch this video in the late 80s and early 90s. The music videos are great and and they will bring back some good memories. I just wish i could find it on dvd.
1,Out-dated and superficial,"It is always welcome to have new books about the social welfare system. Unfortunately, this books contains information that is rather out-dated. Most damagingly, the treatment here is really quite superficial. It may be useful for those who wish to have an overview of the matter, but it won't prove to be of great use to those who're looking forward to a more scholarly treatment of the subject matter."
4,Contrived,"I was rather disappointed by this entry in the Kincaid / James mysteries. The plot of his ex-wife calling him out of the blue and him trotting back to her like a dumb puppy do work for me. Just unbelievable that there would be no recriminations of any kind on either side. Silly, actually. The mystery was too contrived and the personal revelations at the end were sad. I do not care to see so many women shown to be so cold and selfish."
2,Don't waste your time,"Read a third of it hoping it would get better. But it was BORING! Oh well, can't win them all."
1,Not worth it,"No choice of color, and all of the pieces come in the same color. Really inexpensive, but equally cheap in appearance. Don't waste your money here."
2,How are these helpful?,"I bought two of these, first two times using them, everything stuck to them. In both cases I was making cookies (with a lot of butter). I didn't add any additional spray/lube/butter to the mat, because I thought that was the point of using them. Theoretically cleanable in a dishwasher, but they're so floppy and large that it's impractical. I left them soak in the sink and the dough did come right off after a few minutes of soaking. But... how is this better than a regular cookie sheet? I can put that in the dishwasher. A cooking salesperson today told me she had the silpat (or similar) and they worked great. I told her mine stuck and she said, ""Oh, you must have the Kitchenaid ones.""Buy something else."
3,Pleasant Romantic Adventure,"Even the worst Cathy Maxwell book is worth reading, so when I say that The Marriage Contract is not as good as the previous two books in this trilogy, Married in Haste and A Scandalous Marriage, I do not mean it should be avoided.Just know that it is not as witty, entertaining and passionate as Cathy Maxwell's other books. Still, she creates fully rounded characters in the persons of Anne Burnett, a failed debutante, and Aidan Black, a strong independent man who is laird of a beautiful castle in the Scottish Highlands.Anne is sent to Aidan as his bride by proxy, yet the last thing he wants is to marry. The novel is the story of how they come to love each other and to fight together against the unjust English land clearances. It is a pleasant and interesting adventure."
2,Mediocre at best,"The plot is very promising and the first half of the book is quite decent, but the second half was just one big 'blah'. There is no real chemistry between Anne and Aiden and the first sex scene happens way, way into the book. This is not necessary bad, but there really was no spark between them and the author focuses on everything else than their relationship. As the other reviewer here suggests, it almost seems that the author was too uncomfortable to write about real feelings and sexual interactions. This book can be easily read by a 14 year old if you go and cross the two page sex scenes out.Maybe it's just me, but I like my romance novels to have some steam and real passion."
1,Ridiculous Price. Just Buy the Seasons Seperately.,"Breaking Bad itself is an excellent show and I'd easily rate it 5 stars. The 1 star isn't for the show itself, but the ridiculous selling price, which other reviews have pointed out. If you were to buy these three seasons seperately on Amazon, it'd come up to about $45 instead of the $90 that this seller is charging. This is a ripoff, pure and simple. Pass on this unless you just like throwing away money."
4,Usable Information,"""The New Seed Starter's Handbook"" -It contains a lot of interesting information about seeds to sprouts Self pollination and length of seed viability is good data.."
5,This album might make you want to be better person,"When I listen to this album I feel relieved I feel warm and happy I look at the world in a different way. i'm not going to talk about spirituality in this review, but there is something different about danielson's music, something deeper, stronger and more powerful than anything it could be compared to. forget the shallow observations from sufjan stevens and the polyphonic spree, this is the real stuff."
2,Excessive edits/remixing,"This is another unfortunate example of editing decent pop songs into oblivion and then remixing with little consideration of the original production values.It could have been a great 2 CD compilation, with the original mixes minus the single edits.Unlikely to ever happen."
3,Just ok,I was so excited that there was a sterling silver box chain for the price that I received it at. Well everyone is always saying if it seems too good to be true it probably is....well I think that this necklace is just that. It is mirrored so it is shiny but that is about all that it is good about it. I love box chains because they are stronger than just a plain linked chain but all of my other chains are fluid and move very nicely around my neck. This one is so extremely rigid that I have yet to wear it for fear of it snapping and then the possibility that the pendent that is on it will be lost.It is not so bad as to send it back for the money that I spent on it but like I said I have yet to bring myself to wear it.
5,My favorite Rinaldi book!,"Ann Rinaldi is one of my favorite authors, and it shows through this book! I'm a big fan of the Revolutionary War- and Rinaldi portrays it perfectly.Jemima Emerson is wedged between two brothers, with a caring mother, a stern father, and a Loyalist tutor, John Reid. Jem has a flavored personality- she's spunky, wilful, yet knowegable! The Brits and the Hessians come to her town....she discovers a family secret....she falls in love w/ the person you least expect...Ann Rinaldi did a fabulous job on this book. It tell about the REvlolutionary War, yet it doesn't emphasise on all the blood and gore. The signature romance story is wonderful, and I'd recommend this book to anyone!"
5,(sigh!!) A GREAT book,This is one of those books taht is just a pleasure to read. I read this book after seeing it on a list with some other books I enjoyed and disided to read and it was worth my time. I read it twice!! There is this one part that is the best part and you will know what I'm atalking about after you read it!! So READ it!!! I'm not kidding!
5,Romance in Trenton in the Revolutionary War,"In this wonderful book, I learned about realistic fiction and I couldn't have loved it more. It was so inspirational that John Reed and Jemima fell in love after so many troubles together. The sad parts were so touching and the happy parts were so amazing and all together they fit perfectly. I would definitely recommend it."
4,It was slept on!,"I truly think bridging the gap was one of the most slept on CD's of all time. ""Big Pimpin"" promted me to by the album, but it got little airplay. Charlie Wilson is one smooth mutha (shut your mouth)! His smooth vocals stand the test of time. This is one album that should be in everyone's collection. Everyone young and old will be able to relate. You did a great job trying to Bridge the Gap, Charlie, it's just too bad more of us didn't cross over that bridge!"
3,Solid follow up,"Castle Roogna is the 3rd in the Xanth series. Like the other books, the target audience is young boys around 10-13. There is some sexual content in the books, but nothing that's too age inappropriate. The stories are light and humorous, though adults who are seasoned readers will find the plot predictable at times.In Castle Roogna, 12 year old Dor, the son of Bink (the hero of the previous 2 novels), travels into the past by means of a tapestry in order reanimate a zombie to unite him with his love, Millie, a former ghost. During his adventure, Dor must learn the virtues of courage, loyalty to friends, charity and even continence. It is the right kind of book for a boy Dor's age to read, for many pre-teen boys (and many men) are in need of these great virtues which Dor learns. By sharing in his adventure, these virtues can be passed from story to reader."
5,Jane Austen Videos,"These are my favorite of the many video renditions of the Jane Austen books. After viewing them, I understood the stories clearly for the first time."
4,jane austin collection,A really good buy for Jane Austin fans as this has them all. would recomend this collection to family and friends
1,Pride and Predjudice,"This edition was so heavily edited that if I hadn't known the story, I would have had difficulty figuring out what was going on. This was an abomination. There was room on the CD for all the credits but a good part of the story was edited out."
2,What a Disapointment!,"The lighting & style of the movies are very old (from the 70s) and boring, & the actors are disappointingly unattractive. The book paints a more beautiful version than the characters portrayed in this collection. This set is NOT worth the investment. Save your money for the A&E Romance Collection or buy newer versions individually."
4,Jane Austen Collection,BBC always does a good job of staying as close as possible to the story line. These movies are pretty well done although the acting in some is somewhat stilted.
2,B rated movies,"Don't compare this with the modern versions. I was very disappointed. B rated acting.. corney music, very sterile. .I would return it but once opened, not returnable."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I was looking forward to watching this collection of Jane Austin's novels and was hopeful when I had read previous reviews. I found them to be somewhat stilted in the acting and some having a ""1970's production"" look about them. Actually I was bored by most of them, finding them laborious to watch; disappointing when compared to other productions of these novels that were much better done. I had intended to buy two other sets as gifts for some relatives for Christmas after I had viewed my set, but changed my mind. I know some reviewers loved them, but I did not."
4,A Wonderful Reference Book,Mr. Dorr has done a nice job of writing about the B-24 Liberator in the Pacific. It contains a wealth of information on AAF operations with some information on Navy B-24 operations. I also think it would be a great guide for scale modeling.
5,Works very well,this cleaner works very well it is just as advertised and I would recommend this to anyone who needs a cleaner.
3,VHS Tape Cleaner,Bought tape cleaner to clean the heads of my Tape Player after having trouble with tracking to get a clear picture and good audio. After use tracking was improved to point where a bad tape was made useable.
1,doesn't work,"As other people have mentioned, this product doesn't work with some VCRs. I put it in, hit Play, and the VCR ejects the tape. The cleaning ribbon does not advance at all. When I tried to return it, Amazon said it can't accept packages with hazardous chemicals so I can't return it. Complete waste of money but at least it was cheap."
1,Really Disappointed,The tape unfortunately proved to be a disappointing purchase. I followed the directions on the tape and my VHS player still continued to eat my tapes.
3,VHS tape cleaner,"I don't really know if it works. It didn't help my old VCR, but it is possible that the VCR was already beyond help."
2,cerebral,"Usually I resonate with David's work...this cd is out of my comfort zone. I practice meditation, etc...rather be quiet when ""sitting""...so this is not background music for me."
5,BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!!!,"I know I am not the only reader who grew up thrilling to the adventures of the Three Investigators only to graduate on to Sherlock Holmes as an adult. Now I'm forever reminded of that stuttering parrot (to-to-to-be) whenever Holmes and Watson cross their threshold. Robert Arthur created ideal, escapist reading for kids who love to read (and, believe it or not, for those who don't) when he took us to Rocky Beach, CA. This book stands as one of the very best in the long line of Three Investigator books. Three Investigator fans can only hope that the entire series is reissued! BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!!!"
2,"Content good, writing poor","The author obviously is a creative and intelligent person and his work presents several fantastic ideas and concepts. However, his writing style is almost stream-of-consciousness. The nuggets of true value in this book must be gleaned from excessively wordy paragraphs and multiple tangents to explain trivialities. The result is that beginners will likely get lost or confused, while the experienced reader will get bored. I would love to see a second edition of this book wherein the content has been edited by an experienced technical editor to clean up the verbiage and make the book more concise and clear."
5,GREAT BREAKING HEARTS!!,"This is an Elton album that didn't receive as much ""pub"" as others. Two songs released as singles..""Who Wears These Shoes?"" and ""Sad Songs (Say So Much)""As usual, the songs are both contemplative and rockin'I thought I already had the CD version of this album..as I had the CDs of all EJ albums...along with the original vinyl!! What a great surprise to find this album on amazon.com!!"
5,A Quality puzzle,I purchased by chance a white mountain puzzle done by Fred Swann and was so pleased that I have searched and bought as many of his illustrated puzzles as I could find. My husband and myself find this past time fun and relaxing. Better than watching t.v. and being bored by reruns. So far we have purchased quality puzzles and find outdoor scenes the most fun to do. We plan to buy more as the winter wears on.
5,A refreshing perspective,"Dr. Cooper's book offers readers a firm anchor during these turbulent times in global financial markets. By putting the tech boom and bust in long-term context, and outlining a path for the future, this book makes an important contribution in this period of extreme uncertainty. Dr. Cooper's enthusiasm and general optimism is also a welcome and refreshing perspective at a time of short-term pain for the economy. Overall, a highly recommended read for anyone trying to understand the market turmoil of recent years."
2,Good show; blu-ray might not work for you.,"2 stars is for the blu-ray. The series deserves 4 stars.I like this series, but I had to get the European format DVD from Amazon.co.uk to watch it. On my player the blu-ray would load and display menus and still images, but not moving picturesI don't know what the problem was, but I do know that my international DVD player can read European format PAL discs, and my Panasonic DMP-BD35 (firmware vers 2.4) blu-ray player's manual specifically says that it won't play PAL discs.The blu-ray disk is a region-free disc produced in Britain: the same one sold in England, produced by the regular BBC, and not re-distributed in the US by BBC America (which makes many fine blu-rays; I recommend 'Madagascar' and 'Wonders of the Solar System').The only DVD of 'Ancient Worlds' available as of 1 January 2012 is region-coded for Europe."
3,They Taste Yucky But They Help My Throat!,I have used Halls Cherry flavored Mentho-Lyptus throat drops. I have used them when I have had a cold but I mostly used them when my allergies were making my throat itchy and sore and though I think the taste is mediciney and just not very pleasant and actually kind of yucky I did like how these drops soothed my throat and I can live with the yucky mediciney taste if it helps make my throat feel good. I have tried Halls Throat soother losenges the one with pectin instead of menthol and they taste better then these menthol throat losenges but they just don't adequately relieve my throat so yucky taste and all I will have to go with the ones that make my throat feel better but I wish they would make these taste better!
2,It could have been better,"spirit ring perhaps is an explanation to all why fantasy books function well in series and not standalones.the plot has nothing outstanding that has not been used before by other writers, nor any of the witty funny moments ms bujold created in her other novels. character developemt(imho the author's strong point) was weak and lacked punch.i suggest borrowing this book from your local library unless you are a collector.read ms bujold's absolutely fantastic vorkosigan series instead!"
3,Should have visited the local big box.,The way longer than advertised free shipping was not worth the saved buck. GO TO THE LOCAL BIG BOX AND SPEND THE EXTRA DOLLAR!
3,Make sure it's authorized original HP ink,"I ordered this from databazaar.com and everything on it's web page (product picture, numbers, product description) indicated new (authorized) original HP cartridge, not ""used"" or ""remanufactured"". I received a remanufactured generic ""Ink Cartridge"" (no brand name). I don't like remanufactured (it's too light/brown & runs). I wouldn't have spent so much money if I had known this is what I would get in place of the real HP product. Be sure you check that you're getting what you want!"
3,Amazon and Super Deal,"On 7/20/10 I ordered from Amazon a cartridge of HP black ink; the shipping date on the package was 7/26/10. I opined that the shipping was not timely and the $6.60 shipping cost was obviously set to augment the low price of the product. I just talked to Jacob at Super Deal, and he explained that when one finds a bargain price like that on Amazon, it is Amazon(not Super Deal)that sets the shipping and handling cost(evidently by default). I am sorry I castigated Jacob for this practice, since I now realize it is a ploy used by Amazon. I accepted the pricy shipping cost not because I thought it fair, but had spent too much time searching for the product and had to get back to work. Jacob offered to refund the shipping cost, but I refused; I felt it had been an education in the workings of both Super Deal and Amazon. I will not deal with Super Deal again, and in future I will carefully examine any dealings I might have with Amazon. Sincerely, Nan Sawyer"
