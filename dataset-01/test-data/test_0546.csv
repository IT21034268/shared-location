1,pool bottom,"So I get one of these pools in the spring and watch the handy dandy DVD that comes with the package before I do anything. (Rare for me to actually read/watch the instructions before setting things up.) They never really mention that it is very easy for grass to grow THROUGH the pool liner. Numerous times they say that the tarp under the pool is an option! Well if it is 'optional' then the pool must be sturdy. I just happen to have a big blue tarp in the shed so I decided to use it.My 4 year used the pool 3 times before I realized that grass was growing through the tarp and the bottom of the pool, making it leak. I re-consult my handbook and in very faded print it says that ""the manufacturer is not responsible for grass growing through the bottom and it is not a defect."" Umph, it is not a defect yet they still sell these things without fixing it or improving it? What a bunch of baloney.AWFUL product made in China."
2,2 Times is not the charm,"Pool looks great on the web, however just sent back the 2nd pool. They both have leaks from the base of the pool on the seams. I will say having a broken product, knowing it has issue and doing nothing about it says a lot about the company Intex. I have some advice for Intex, call and use KT to come and find the issue with your pools. There is a problem if you look at any of the reviews a majority of them say ""leaks from the bottom seams"" this is not just a one-time issue you have a large % of this problem. Call KT they will work with you find the problem so that you can fix it and get 5 out of 5 stars!!!!! For now you get 2 stars and you are lucky you got two!"
3,Good for pool therapy,"Picture is misleading a bit. Remember it is NOT a large pool. It is only a few feet deep, so not a good pool for 8 years old and older to play around in. It is great to float and relax in, or do pool therapy exercises. DO NOT put it on rocks, thinking you don't want to ruin your grass. That is the quickest way to get tiny holes in the bottom. Great pool to last a couple summers."
2,NOT SATISFIED,"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM, IT IS NOT A EASY SET OR TAKE DOWN POOL, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECTLY LEVEL OR POOL FILLS LOP-SIDED EVEN IF IT'S OFF BY A INCH. MY HUSBAND AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE IDEAL POOL FOR US, JUST TO COOL OFF IN, GOT IT THIS PAST SUMMER, AND WORKED ON GETTING IT PUT UP NEVER GOT IT UP RIGHT AFTER FILLING IT TWO TIMES AND WASTING WATER. WE EVEN CALLED A LOCAL POOL COMPANY HERE AND THEY WOULD NOT EVEN COME OUT AND TOUCH IT , SAID THEY DIDN'T RECOMENED IT. WHEN IT COME TIME TO TAKE IT DOWN BEFORE IT TURNED COLD WEATHER AND FROZE, WE HAD JUST AS MUCH TROUBLE TAKING DOWN AS PUTTING UP. DOESN'T DRAIN EVENLY, THE VIDEO SHOWS TWO PEOPLE PUTTING IT UP AND TAKING IT DOWN, YOU ACTUALLY NEED AT LEAST 4 IF NOT 6 PEOPLE."
1,Useless!,This is a nightmare to setup in uneven territory. Tried 5 different spots in my yard and never worked.Wasted money! Get yourself a membership at the YMCA and save yourself some money.No stars for this product!!!
2,Not all its cracked up to be.,"So i purchased this tea to help with my lactation and i find that it did nothing for me. The taste was not good either, it kind of has this syrup after taste that is so bad. Didn't work for me."
4,Helpful & tasty,This producted helped increase my milk during a stressful time. It has a pleasant taste and was well priced.
1,no much mothers milk,This tea did not work for me and istead of helping me produce more milk i stop producing milk iafter the third day of use i did not finish the box because i may not have a lot of milk but its something compare to when i was drinking the tea and my milk production stop completely
3,Worth the try,"The price was not bad for this tea, but I never noticed it working. I think it is something you have to drink constantly throughout the day to work. Which means you'll probably have to buy multiple boxes at once to keep up with demand."
1,Created a gassy baby!,"While this product did increase my milk production, it made my son so gassy that he did not sleep for almost an entire day. I had to throw away all the milk I pumped while using this tea as it made my son extremely fussy and gassy. I suggest you start with one or two bags per day to see if it has any negative side effects on your baby."
2,My Baby Didn't Take to It,"I picked this up from my local left-wing health food store thinking I was saving a bundle over my baby's usual brand of formula. Upon following directions, I thought the yellowy-brown liquid looked more like a sick mother than healthy breastmilk! This stuff doesn't resemble anything close to milk for a baby. I give it two stars because my kid quit crying when the teapot whistled. A few moments of respite from colicky screechings is priceless, but I wouldn't recommend Mother's Milk as a substitute for breast milk, which as we know, is best."
2,Sadly didn't work for me,"I hoped this tea would boost my milk supply, but much to my disappointment it did not have any noticeable effect (this is for my seond child and I am pumping at work). I liked the anise flavor of the tea, but imagine that others might not enjoy it."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I tried this product in hopes that it would increase my milk supply. With my son, I was only able to pump 2-4oz a day. When I had my daughter, I also had a low milk supply. I ate oatmeal and noticed an increase in my milk supply to 6-7oz a day. I decided to also try Mother's Milk tea in hopes to get another increase in my milk supply but did not see a difference. I am glad I only bought 2 boxes of the tea instead of buying it in bulk even though it was cheaper."
3,Paint-by-numbers Decadence,"Gender inversion, sadism, masochism, exoticism, hallucinations, exploitation, the artificial creation of a perfect lover, sensuality--all of these are commonplaces of works of the Decadent movement, and, I'm sorry to say, Rachilde rarely lends any vitality or insight to these cliched devices. Add some extraneous characters, overblown melodramatic situations, and poor attention to detail, and this perfectly describes ""Monsieur Venus"". Unless you are a scholar of Decadence or a serious fetishist, I wouldn't read this particular work. I'd recommend Huysmans, Gautier, Wilde, Villiers, or even Sacher-Masoch in its stead."
3,Pretty good bed,"First and foremost my impression when the beds arrived was that the cushion seemed really light and flimsy. I was expecting something a thicker with some more weight to it. As for the cover itself, I really like it. My cats seem to enjoy the beds - that's all that really matters.As far as the size, it's perfect for my 10-11 lb. cat. My 12-13 lb. love is a little too long to fit in this bed."
1,dsd sa-cd & dts don't mix,"I would bet that there is a ""dts"" 5.1 track there; stereo if you're lucky with mono coming out the center, rears, and sub. This has been done in Asia for awhile; plus dsd isn't designed for optical output; dts is. It would be great, though."
4,The Corries Sing the Bonny Music of Scotland,"Recently I came upon the music of this bonny group ofScot singers and musicians and was I hooked! From theballad Flower Of Scotland to their whimsical pieces suchas Tibbie Dunbar, you will be enthralled. Every song hasa message and the Corries Scottish sound is captivating;it will transport you to the Scotland of old as well asthe Scotland of today. Be warned, you will want tocollect all their music."
3,Review,"This book has a lot of very useful information and you can tell that the authors try to break it down for the reader. If you have never written an action research plan and need to know how, this is a great book, but for reading for fun, it would not be very interesting."
5,Its just as it looks,it was just what i wanted my niece is in love with her george! it came in record time also well packaged
2,A competent battle narrative,"A competent popularized battle narrative that fails to capture the magnitude of suffering and carnage that took place on Okinawa. A better history encompassing the human dimension is Tennozan: the Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb. It is a griping appocoliptic description of this greatest of all Pacific War battles, one that dwarfed Iwo Jima, Tarawa and Peleliu combined."
4,Excellent guide but failed to reach the destination,"This is one of the best guide books for anyone who wonders ""where are we from?"". However, the author leaves us unanswered as to ""The origin of language"" just like all other linguists.Nevertheless, his argument against Roman Jakobson's hypothesis on ""mama"" and ""papa"" is very convincing. His special attention to other kin terms like ""kaka"" gives us meaningful suggestion how to cope with the obstacles on our road in search of the origin of languages."
3,Could have been a good article,"The core idea of the book is extremely interesting. The vivid, interactive examples he brings make it very exciting to follow his path to the discovery of commonalities among different languages.But, after the third round of comparing words, the game grows old and repetitive. Additionally, I dislike the fact that, in almost every chapter, the makes a point of attacking other scientists who disagree with his ideas. Say it once and move on, please.In short, it's just like many other books: in the hands of a good, brave editor, it would have been turned into an amazing 20-page article."
3,This book is alright,This book is okay in my opinion. Some areas seem to be a little more influenced by the author's opinions. I would recommend it if you are beginning into the area of teaching english as a second or foreign language.
2,"Pretty weak ""detecting""","This is the second book I've read in this series, and I was quite disappointed. Lois does little actual detecting--in fact, none at all that I could see. She just bashes around saying ""feisty"" things to one and all. There were a lot of loose ends, too. The killer gave a reason for murdering victim #1 but not such a good reason for dressing the victim in armour and dragging others into the plot. I got the feeling the writer came up with a good opening scenario and thought up a half-baked reason for it later on. Finally, as a middle-class American, I'm not sure how working-class English people talk, but it all seemed a little forced and precious to me. If Lois' husband, Derek, called her ""me duck"" or ""gel"" one more time, I might have screamed. Pretty weak stuff and not really a detective novel at all."
5,Love this DVD,"Found this show on TV after the series was almost halfway thru--when the show ended, I was so disappointed that I would not be able to watch it anymore. How happy I was to find out the entire show would be released on DVD---I was not disappointed!Can now watch this show over and over and whenever I want to!"
1,don't recommend this,"the story was great but the dvd is lacking some of the most important scenes in the soapopera. I am really dissapointed in the product, but like i said the show was great, yet everything was editted out."
3,What happened?!?!,"At first I thought it was I who was remembering the sequence of the story wrong, but I soon realized that a slew of scenes were left out of the DVD. As a result, the story line is confusing and doesn't flow smoothly. I'm so disappointed as the DVD does absolutely no justice to the original series which I loved. Overall, the series itself is AWESOME, but the DVD hacks it to pieces. In my opinion, nothing should have been edited and the series should have been sold as a whole. Learned a great deal of Spanish, though."
5,GREAT VIDEO!! - You won't be disapointed !!,"As all the Brainy Baby products, the Animals video actually TEACHES your child while entertaining them. I especially like the fact that all the Brainy Baby videos are 45 minutes long (about 20 minutes longer than most popular videos). We have all the others..... but Brainy Baby is simply the best. It's longer (for the same price), it has solid educational content (so baby really learns something) and it uses real life images (no puppets or animation). They really do have the winning combination. I only wish I had not spent all the money on the other brand of videos. If I had to do it all over again, I would just buy the Brainy Baby series. They have all the bases covered."
1,Boring!!,"My baby wouldn't watch this for more than one minute! I hated the use of animals in cages, and thought the quality of the footage was just terrible. Very amature."
5,The best book...as good as Harry Potter.,"Dear Lloyd Alexander, If you're reading this then keep on reading it. I think that THE TIME CAT was so good. I think it was as good as Harry Potter. Because I love cats and I love adventures. I wish that you would make a series from TIME CAT with new characters, like maybe a dog that joins their quest with them. Or some helpful creature that joins them and maybe you could go to Hawaii. I loved the book because Gareth and Jason went to all these amazing places and met all these interesting friends. I love adventures, I love climbing, I love to read adventure books. I usually won't read books that aren't adventure books."
2,"Time Cat, A Waste of Time","The concept is marvelous: a mysterious cat enables a boy to visit a variety of fascinating places and times in which the cat has spent its previous lives! This should be a gripping tale. Unfortunately, the writing is so dry and unexciting as to make finishing the book the mere fulfillment of a commitment..."
3,A Cat of Time,"If you like to imagine that you can go places at different times, then this would be a great book for you. Time Cat would set your mind in time travel to nine diffrent times and places where a boy and his talking cat go to the past. One place they go is Japan, where they become friends with a child emperor. The time cat, Gareth, teaches the emperor's kittens to hunt mice that are in the village and teach the emperor how to act like an emperor.I like how the author made the cat have one life and the power to go to nine diffrent places."
3,time cat,"Time Cat is a book that does not carry on a single plot. Every section has a new storyline. I liked this book because at any time you can pick it up and read one short story start to finish. most of the sections have a twist at the end of them, something that makes you think.do not read this book if you are looking for something very intense or gripping. This is just a fun story that would be very good for children."
5,"THIS IS THE BEST LULLABY CD AROUND, NO KIDDING!","My sister passed the entire set of tapes to me when my son was born. It was her saving grace with her colic baby. It shortly became mine. My son is now 19 months old and as soon as he hears the heart beats he climbs into bed without much resistance at all. The tapes are now worned out from excessive use and I have recently purchased two cd's, one for home and one for daycare. The CD is a hit at daycare! His friends seem to love the music as well."
3,Deeply Disappointed,I started historical novels with Garwood and was pleasantly surprised at how the first Murray and McEnroy were similar... until I read this one. How could she kill of Dairmot and Ilsa? I understand this is a novel of Connor and Gilly but I think this could have been thought through more.
1,I will never buy microsoft hardware again!!,"I should have listented to the reviews about how the mouse locked up. In my case, the mouse stopped working less than 24 hours after I received the item. [...]"
5,Perineal bottle found at last!,"For several years I have been searching in vain to find these bottles. I live in Canada, and for whatever reason, pharmacies, and even medical suppliers, do not carry them. I was given one after the birth of our second daughter and found it to be most helpful. Now that I care for others, I wanted to purchase some. Thank goodness for Amazon. The bottle is perfect and very affordable."
3,Even Great Authors Have Duds,"I am a big fan of Orson Scott Carde after reading the Alvin Maker series. Just finished reading Wyrms and I was really dissapointed in the book. Throughout this entire novel there is this powerful driving sexual anticipation between the main character and the villian. Through the first hundred pages or so I really didn't like the novel. It was just a girl doing near exactly what she was told. Later on the character does examine who she really is and is interested to find it. The search for identity being as a good a driving force as any - and better than some - I was pleasantly surprised that her past put a good spin on the concept. Are we what we were made to be or are we individuals? Not that I minded it ending, but I felt the book was inadequately wrapped up."
1,Save your money.,"You know, typically people don't make you pay to read their advertisements. This is an exception. Each of the self-serving articles in this book is followed by a 1-2 page advertisement for the author that, not surprising, offers a service to solve the problem outlined in the article. How convenient! This book is a glorified collection of vendor-sponsored white papers."
5,?,this pool is the best. it is bigger and deaper than my old pool i think this pool is for 4 years old and up
3,Somewhat unbelievable - I've read better by this author,"Suspension of disbelief is necessary for so much of the plot of this book. While the romance between Griffin and Gates is certainly well-written, the circumstances of their meeting are pretty unlikely in the first place, as is Griffin's failure to make her his mistress once he realises his attraction to her. If he genuinely believes she's an uneducated farm girl, there is no way he would treat her as a valued guest in his home, or that his aunt would welcome her as if she was a social equal. The sexual tension is certainly well drawn, but I found it very hard to believe that - even with Lady Min's ultimatum in his mind - Griffin would have waited so long before consummating the relationship.So... has its moments, but certainly by no means Butler's best. I'd recommend The Rake's Retreat or Lord Monteith's Gift in preference."
4,First try worked great,"This is my first attempt at recording analog video from my camcorder to the computer. I'm using Windows ME, 1.4G Pentium 4 with 384M of 800Mhz ram and a 60G hard drive. I had a few problems getting the drivers to load but the full setup took less than an hour. I recorded a video to disk with relative ease. The software provided is easy to use and very powerful.The only problem is I guess I didn't need the Bi-Lingual version and could have saved $ purchasing the non Bi-Lingual version.At first glance ADS Tech seems to have provided a solid product with some great software. I'm looking forward to burning all of my camcorder tapes and old VHS movies to DVD after I play with the video editing features."
1,DO NOT BUY,"The hose broke, the siphon tube broke, the hoses leaked, the pot leaked, the regulator would not keep a constant pressure and the adjustments would not stay as set. I have used many other spay guns both at work [docks and equipment] and home [cars, bikes, house]. We moved and I bought this to do the decks on the new house and the price looked good. I did half of the underside of one deck before this went in the garbage. This is the worst tool I have used in 40 years of using tools. Do not waste your money, time and effort."
2,Am I missing something?,"From an objective point of view, this propably is not so (just look at all these reviews), but *I* though this was weird, could not decide whether to be badly quasi-scientific or just supernatural, and could not possibly frighten me to the least because I was being too busy thinking it was stupid. There were some (potentially) good elements, they were just buried deep beneath all the crap. Oh well, maybe I should read it again."
3,"For fans of the video game this is fantastic, for others it's enjoyable","Sands of Destruction is based off the recent Nintendo DS game by the same name. Having played the game first I found myself really enjoying the series because of seeing some charming characters from the game in full animated glory.The plot follows Morte, Kyrie, and Taupy (best Teddy bear ever!) as they travel their world in search of a way to destroy the world all while being chased by the ""World Salvation Committee"" (with smooth Naja and sexy psycho Lia being the members.)The story is simple and similar to one you'd find in a 90s anime but what makes the show work are the excellent characters who are very lively and fun.The art/animation/soundtrack while nothing spectacular are pretty well done and the English language track is great.Worth owning if you enjoyed the game and worth renting if you haven't. Either way you'll at least be entertained for a few hours."
2,Could be better...,"When I got this book, I was initially impressed. The texts Unschuld selects are interesting to be sure. The worst part is that it is very user UNfriendly. The texts are long, and finding the corresponding pinyin and translation is impossible. Additionally, this is not really a language teaching book. The author includes only the pinyin and a translation. There are no grammar explanations or any other explanations for that matter. There are some historical footnotes, but nothing that helped me read the texts. The reader is expected to figure it all out through the translation, making the book no more valuable than any other translation that includes characters. The more I *try* to work with this book, the less I like it. Unschuld is a great historian, but not a very good language teacher. I highly suggest Goodman'sClassical Chinese Medical Texts: Learning to Read the Classics of Chinese Medicine (Vol. I)over this."
3,Not good for all spanish speaking,It is too advanced for folks that did not go to school in Spanish. And definitely not good for folks with Dementia.
3,Really fun/neat for about 10 minutes,"This was cool for my child (and myself for that matter) for about 10 minutes. It was neat to see how the thing would balance with addition as opposed to equal weights. However, after the initial excitement wore off it didn't offer enough interest to make it a good manipulative. This manipulative can really slow down instructional time and in my opinion doesn't really ""show"" the child why math works. For our math instruction, we have found that Cuisenaire rods ""show"" how math works the best while the game Double Shutter to be the best tool in the world to help reinforce simple addition. I cannot recommend Double Shutter enough. We love that game for it's entertainment value and because it is highly educational.Double Shutter"
1,disappointment in description,I have not opened the game as yet. I just received & am very dismayed to see on the back cover the game is for 1 player. I bought this game because the description listed said 1-2 players.
5,THIS CANNOT GET ANY BETTER.,I have been a gamer since the first ATARI system came into play. I am AMAZED at how far games have come from the good ol days of atari's COMBAT to the high end graphics and story lines of ACE COMBAT 5. Now I love flight sim's. And have been playing them for a long time. But I have to say this game is nothing short of AMAZING. It draws you into another world. Its almost like interacting with a MOVIE. The story line is awsome and the character's make you think that they are REAL people firghting for their live's. At one point in the game one of the main character's gets shot down and you have to go rescue them. I found myself worrying about the person and rushing through the next mission just to make sure they were safe. Now yes I know im pathetic. But hey the game is that good. If you like to fly and love a good story line buy this game. Don't wait !!!!!
3,Don't know that I'd buy it over AC4.,"Without going into too much detail, Ace Combat 5 is fun, but I don't see the selling point over Ace Combat 4.I really enjoyed AC4, so I was looking forward to the release of AC5. After renting AC5 for a week, I'm not sure I'd buy it.Usually, as a title evolves, greater capability is added. In AC5, the opposite actually seems to have taken place. While it's a nice addition to be able to give commands to your wingmen, sometimes they ask you questions, which require a yes/no response via the controls, and well, they frequently seem to ask at the worst possible times, when you're busy doing more important things. All in all, the game doesn't really feel much different at all, aside from a new storyline.The biggest ommisions from Ace Combat 5... there's no longer a 2 player mode, in order to dogfight with your friends. You'd think perhaps that in lieu of this, they've enable online fighting via internet network, but nope, that's not there either. Curious ommision."
4,best dogfighting game ever!!,"You'll love this game if you like dog fighting games the best part is that its not a short game so you won't get bored of it quickly, it has like at lest 30 mission or more.The second thing is the graphics there the best for a 2006 game every detail is superb.The third thing is the aircraft, WOW!!!!!So cool each airplane has its own special weapons like the F-117 Nighthawk has GPB bombs its so cool.But in the single player mode when you talk with you squadron it very annoying sometimes because they just keep asking you questions and stuff its just very annoying. But its very fun diving,climbing,turning you aircraft and firing missiles is very fun.BUY IT,ITS AWESOME!!"
3,Okay,This game is okay but can be a bit hard. We had fun playing. It alomost feels like you on a simulator.
2,just ok,"they are just ok, I would have rather bought one from the store, they are a rope with the plastic beads, they are black and white, not one soild color like i had thought. They say its adjustable but I have yet to figure out how"
4,Item rating,"The mag is not bad. It is only published in three issues a year. It seems to mainly focus on resorts. I would like it to focus a bit more on equipment, technique and on day-skiing sites (not just fly-to type resorts).The editing could be tighter (spelling, grammer, puncuation). I subscribe to a sea-kayaking mag and the level of production seems a bit higher."
2,Title Mislead Me,"I bought this book thinking that it demonstrated some techniques, that McTimoney chiropractic was a new type of chiropractic that the layperson could do. The book is very informative and interesting, but it is about a type of chiropractic done in Britian. For someone interested in McTimoney's history, educational requirements for licensing, what it does and does not treat, it is great. Unfortunately, it just wasn't what I wanted."
1,Missing items,Quick delivery but I only received the disk. No pump or DVD were included. There were spots in the package for such things but neither item was included. DISAPPOINTED! Beware.
2,Watch this Seller!,Just received the GoFit Core Disk - I was sent a used product for a new price! The box was open and the disk was scuffed up and covered with dirt! I will not purchase from these folks again!
4,Highly recommended for both new and old fans alike.,Patrick Humphries' concise CD sized booklet lives up to its name. It is highly recommended for both new and old fans alike.Humphries' review of Morrison's albums will provide an excellent starting point for the neophyte Van fan who may well be overwhelmed by the abundance of choices in the back catalogue of Van Morrison.The seasoned Van fan will likewise enjoy (and more than likely disagree!) with Humphries' knowledgeable critique of the albums.
3,Yesterday's Cildren,This is a true of a woman's search for her lost family from a previous lifetime. I feel that I would have liked to see a lot more of the book put into this adaptation. Her inner struggle trying to determine whether these memories were real or mere imagination etc
3,What does the title have to do with the Plot,"tho i'll tune into the 2nd Coming of the Cloning and I'm sure there were details that would've enhanced my enjoyment that I missed with the abidged CD version - this played more like a Steve McQueen ""Bullet"" like chase than anything the title intimated. I've read better crafted thrillers and tho the subject was intiguing the final product was disapointing & very predictable."
2,what a dud...,"I listened to this as an audio book. In retrospect, I should have checked it out from the library rather than purchasing it. It started out with an exciting discovery of what may have been the Cross. It caught my attention at the beginning, however, the poor editing became obvious early (I'm giving the writer the benefit of doubt here...) - in spite of it having been 'read' in audio format. I found myself wanting to edit what I was hearing. Senese's editor should find another line of work.Phrases I would use to describe this book: superfluous & tediously repetitious descriptions, inconsistent syntax, structurally unstable, & unconvincing dialogue.I would not purchase a sequel. I'm not even sure I would waste the time with a library version.Time would be better served listening (or reading) Peterson's 'The Message'."
2,Go for a simple one,"Does not have any special features comparing to the regular basic one. Has very annoying squeeking sound when walking on it, it not easy ot return or exchange due to its very heavy weight."
3,Bleak effort,"At first, this CD somewhat puzzled me. I mean, I know that Sinatra style of swing is better served by Basie style energy than by Ellington style subtliety,but than again, Sinatra worked so well with A. C. Jobim, showing a tender and sophisticated side that could be useful here as well.It just does not work. As a Sinatra album it is mildly boring, as an Ellington album it is a big disappointement, as a collaboration between the two, it just does not happen. Big bands (particularly Basie orchestra) often served the will of popular singers but this half-breed cd shows that sometimes even that sort of arrangement is better than merging of the incompatible."
4,Extremely Good College Material,This book has been used by many college institutions as the basis of their Sociology instruction. The book contains many real life sociological issues and presents them to the reader in a way that is both modernized and easy to understand. The author of this book has many years of experiance in the Sociological field and has authored and co-authored many sociological books. This specific book provides an extremely good fundemental basis for individuals seeking a strong basic foundation for a focus on Sociological education.
3,The First Communist Outlines His Program,"This book has to be read, as a defense, especially by freedom loving people, because Plato outlines his ""ideal"" society. Think Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, today's Iran, the Inquisition, and today's American ""Nanny/Theraputic State"" all rolled into one mega dictatorship, with of course, the omnipotent and authoritarian ""philosopher-king"" in charge. Now, philosophy is a science crucially needed today, but it has to be the right philosophy. Sadly, we live in a Platonic age and the continuting disintegration of America into a fascist/religious nightmare. Let's hope the pendulum is swinging toward the antidote: Aristotle's ""pursuit of happiness"". Obviously, the [so far] lone commentor hasn't a clue."
3,"Awesome, but cheap","When I first saw this item, I was intrigued by the concept of a fountain mimicing candles, you know, the whole fire and water in one concept. When I received the fountain, I was a little disappointed by the cheap materials used in its fabrication. The ""candles"" are pretty cheap plastic, as is the base. Included were just enough river rocks to barely cover the base. And the flickering LEDs? They would be awesome except that all three ""candles"" flicker with the same pattern at the same time, somewhat ruining the illusion of real candles.On the plus side, the pump is quiet and the sound of the water flow is pretty relaxing. If you put this thing on a shelf in the corner and don't look at it too closely, it's wonderful ambiance. But don't expect too much."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought 2 of these fountains, 1 for home and 1 for my office. 1 sounded like a jet engine taking off. I could not even hear the water running. The second one was very quiet...because it would not pump any water at all. I had purchased one of these 5 years ago and it was very quiet and lasted a very long time.I guess they are not making them as well anymore.Do not recommend."
4,A Disturbing Claim,"Thought this documentary lacks the budget of other better known directors, Alex Jones has put forward a compelling case. What's most disturbing are the direct quotes from various world leaders and business men."
1,For Playgirl,I don't think this book was interesting in the least. I would expect to find something like this written in the pages of Playgirl.
1,Won't fit Ergotron LX Desk Mount LCD Arm 45-241-026,"This product consists of a fairly thin-gauge steel tube, painted in black crinkle finish. The outer diameter of this tube is 1.5""; the diameter of the 7"" extension tube on the Ergotron LX Desk Mount LCD Arm 45-241-026Ergotron LX Desk Mount LCD Arm 45-241-026is 1.375"".So, you unfortunately cannot use this product to increase the mounting height of the Ergotron Desk Mount LCD Arm. The price also appears to be excessive for what you get.As an alternative, I plan to try 1.375"" OD Welded Stainless Tube 304/304L from an online metals supplier. You can buy it pre-cut to various multiples of 12"" lengths."
2,The Concert Sinatra,"Arranged by the excellent Nelson Riddle,this 1963 album came in the middle of a particularly fallow period,which started with the singer's establishment of his own Reprise label in 1961.Albums of a high quality would not re-appear until 1965 ( September of My Years ) and this particular album is very poor indeed.Firstly,it is not a "" concert "" album,but is an album of showtunes,mostly Richard Rodgers tunes.If you like that sort of stuff,then this is for you.It's "" Ol' Man River "" and the like,which,to modern ears,sound terribly ( terminally ? ) dated.Of curiosity is an 8 minute track - Soliloquoy - but this is only of interest for the length.For fans of musicals only."
4,worth listening to,vocal technique is as important as ability.note the old man riover cut on this session. extraordinary and worth the price of admission alone.
1,An insult to Christian's intelligence,From the very first pages of this book it is clearly evident the deep ignorance of the author about the basic principles of evolution. The least one could expect from a critic is to have a reasonable level of knowledge of the field.My granmother would have probably written a better book after reading a few chapters of evolution for dummies.
5,the lie,"Another good book from ken ham to help answer some lingering questions. But if you have the ""New answer book"" a lot of the same discussions are in there also."
1,what a load of cr@p!!!,"Well, I think all christians will think it's superb. Anything that reinforces their blind faith has got to be good. But as a non-theist person who has examined both viewpoints, I'd say this book is one of the many creation texts out there which fall into the same old straw arguments and don't really convince anyone."
1,opportunistic scumbags get one star! Shouldn't have even one!,"One may ask why would someone so virulently against those that create crazy ""revisionist anti-science history"" read such a book, because ... it was free. I fortunately did not have to pay a dime for this sewage. I think in this case sewage is a nice word. Really to nice. The Lie: Evolution is written for those that want to believe what they want to believe ... not what is.Mr.Hamm victimizes reality ... rapes it, and then presents it to cowardly morons that refuse to admit that the scientific method is at the heart of our future not sitting around throwing their sons and daughters to the volcano God everytime things don't go their way. Jesus would probably smack you silly for believing in this crazed Pharisitical crap."
2,Not all that great...,"If you're looking for arguments against evolution, you really won't find them here. I don't really like the way Ken Ham writes. He rehashes stuff over and over and it gets tiring. I don't know how many times I was subjected to the ""destroying our foundations"" thing or the ""billions of dead things buried under rock layers by water"" thing. It's like he wants so much to disprove evolution but he doesn't support himself. I've read better. Check out ""Man's Origin-Man's Destiny"" by A.E. Wilder-Smith"
1,Rubbish...,"Despite the overwhelming physical evidence supporting the contrary, Ken Ham is persistent in his efforts to bring the works of Charles Darwin into disrepute. This book not only demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of macro-evolution and natural selection as a whole, but also seeks to promote the consistently spurious claims of faith-based superstition. I would urge any individual who believes in science (i.e- anyone who could not do without: an iPhone, an iPod, a computer, the internet, satellites, television, vaccines, combustion engines, telephones, electricity, etc.) to boycott this publication for your children's sake. The day that a creation scientist invents ANYTHING beneficial to the advancement of the human species is the day you should buy this book. Until that day comes- don't waste your hard earned money. Thank you..."
1,Wow .... ummmm ... wow.,"Near the end of the book, where Ham is fully committed to trying to scare the reader into rejecting evolution, he explains that Satan created evolution theory. Did he just write it on papyrus and drop it in the neumatic tube like they have at the bank drive-through? The more Christians that read this book, the less Christians there will be. I read it out of morbid fascination. It reads like a Moonie pamphlet. To all those who give it 5 stars, well, please don't procreate. A world full of godless sinners has a better chance to evolve without you. And YOU Ken Ham."
1,Garbage,Horrible bashing of scientific fact simply based on religious beliefs without the slightest understanding of the science behind what he is trying to debunk.Do not buy in to this trash.
2,quite poorly done,"Here we have an economist who is presenting opinions with little evidence. This book is so off the mark that it is difficult to read. The only interesting points are the facts that he points out about the down side of globalization that I had not heard before. This book should not convince any logical person that globalization is a force for good. Personally I remain unconvinced of the validity of either side, but this book is not even worth reading if you are seriously interested in the debate."
5,Takes you to the next level,"The designs can be very challenging but it is well worth learning them. I particularly like the ones with the string skips, kind of sounds like what Eric Johnson uses on occasion."
5,Salistamba Sutra,"This is a Sutra, that taught by Lord Buddha, about the Pratyasamutpada (Conditioned arising) or 12 Nidana (interlinked chains). Pratyasamutpada means that if this arises then that will arise. The Lord Buddha taught using the parable of green rice. This Sutra was spoken in Rajagraha on Vulture Peak Mountain. The Eightfold Noble Path also mentioned in this Sutra If ones want to know more about the basic of Buddhism, should read this Sutra. For further information and discussion you could e-mail : dh4rm4id@yahoo.com"
5,Excellent product,I've used it for years and it works great. Nothing compares. Some products are cheap but if you look at the dosage you use more and end of wasting your money. Dosage matters. Always check dosage.
3,just ok,"Service was great but the product is just ok. I wasnt surprised at the quality, I knew it was going to be cheaply made."
3,"Great show, but missing episodes and a bit gimmicky season","This is a good show overall. But for the DVD collection, there are six episodes missing from the TV season as aired. Being a completionist, I picked them up from iTunes, but that's an extra $12 expense. One of the episodes in question is even a double-length one. Not impressed by that.Also, this season definitely has more gimmicks--Buddy and the guys have all sorts of silly competitions and excursions that are obviously just filler to make less repetitive TV. Fun I guess, but ultimately hurts the show more than it helps.Overall, if you're a fan, not a bad purchase, but certainly could have been a lot better DVD release. Dropping arbitrary episodes (and some of the best ones at that) is really weak."
5,Cake Boss Season 3,"This was for my granddaughter. She loves the Cake Boss series. Got her Cake Boss and Cake Boss Season 2, as well."
5,I couldn't put this book down!,"Zainab's life story is a lesson for all of us in love and courage. The writing sings and is full of vivid recollections of her life under Saddam. Anyone reading this book will connect in some way: mother-daughter relationship; overcoming fear; telling your story; escaping tyranny; and finding love. I'm going to buy copies for all my friends and encourage them to go to Zainab's organization, Women for Women International (www.womenforwomen.org), and become a sponsor. This woman is a hero of our time."
5,The Decade Of Rock,"The 1980's were the decade of rock in Brazil. Rock Bands popped up all over the place, and Kid Abelha was one of the most ubiquitios. Their success, it must be said, was quite deserved. ""Seu Espio"" and ""Educao Sentimental"" are the hallmarks of perfect brazilian Pop-Rock - in great part due to songwriter Leoni, who later left the band to set up ""Heróis da Resistncia"", and to the striking beauty of lead singstress Paula Toller."
2,Not what I expected,"I suppose I should have researched the content before buying this one. I was expecting more of a devotional book, but instead it's simply ""God's Promises"" re-marketed for single adults.If that's what you need, GREAT! I just wish I had researched it more."
2,A bit too vague for help,"Honestly, if you decide to read this book, don't expect much. It is a rough read and provides random routines that do not provide a great deal of help to anyone trying to get into the sport of powerlifting, or just interested in putting up some weight. The routines in the book really don't provide any helpful info.In short, if you are interested in a tall tale, read Pecos Bill. If you want a good powerlifing routine, read something else. If you want to blow 20 bucks on a few decent exercises you could get from your local trainer, read this.-R-"
4,Nice Chips,"These chips are really cheap compared to many others out there because you can get (1500 chips) for this price. They are durable and make a nice sound when playing. But they are only 11.5 grams not the 14 gram heavy chips. Use these chips on a poker table or put a poker table cover on your table because the chips will scratch and peel the plastic on a hard plastic table. I received these chips three days after ordering them, so they ship very fast. While these are good chips I would prefer the Ben Franklin laser chips because they look nice and are 14 grams. Also, they are the only ones I can I find $50 dollar chips for."
4,Awesome!!,"I have been playing poker online for quite awhile but wanted to start a weekly home game to get some live play experience. I bought this through Amazon because I have always had good experiences buying ""other"" merchandise (not just books) and knew I would be buying a quality set.I was totally impressed by this poker set. I have enough chips to stack a table of 6 - 9 players, dealer button, cards, etc. The chips are 11.5 grams and handle very well. The only negative comment I can make about the chips is that they do not carry a denomination ($1, $5, etc) which sometimes slows my home game a bit when players don't remember what color is what amount.The set contain various buttons (dealer, big blind, small blind), and dice. Everything came in a great stainless-type metal carrying case and looks great when I pull it out on poker night.I bought this set on sale (bargain priced around $35) but wouldn't hesitate to pick it up at a higher price point."
2,it's only what it is,"This novel has a bizzare pace, and an unusual plot structure, but these structural novelties do not rescue the story from tiresomeness. The blatent sexuality, violent but not original enough to be unsettling, is a part of fairytale-fantasies like Sharon Green's, and not new or particularly interesting. I found the characters flat, and I did not like the prose.It's enjoyable if you enjoy romances of heroines rescuing their men from some idea of masculine brutality. Just don't expect anyting else."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT.,"I was given this set as a gift; otherwise I would have read its reviews first and would not have purchased it. The pens never worked with any of the different nibs. At first, no ink would come out, then small, thin streaks would come out, and after continuing to press to get the ink flowing, way too much ink would gush out running all over the pen, paper, my hands, etc. I tried using all 5 nibs several times with different ink tubes and had the same result every time. In addition, out of all the ink tubes I tried, 4 of these were dry even before being used. Needless to say, it ended up being a very frustrating experience and a complete waste of money."
2,Staedtler quality & reputation QUESTIONED!,"The nibs are of very poor quality. Only one nib is satisfactory. I struggle to get the ink to come through the scratchy nibs. I give this kit two stars only because of its variety of ink-color selections. Staedtler has a good reputation, and am surprised that this kit is unsatisfactory. Maybe I received a ""lemon."""
1,Do not buy,Save your money and invest in a better quality product! The pens are of cheap plastic dollar store material. The ink works when it wants to when it does work it leaks everywhere. The inks dry up quickly.
1,don't buy,"The set looks pretty, but the ink has been all dried up. Who needs a set to just look at. I really wasted my money buying these pens unless I can find something to do with the pretty empty cases. I guess I will search for ink refill."
1,Worst pen set I've ever bought,"I always look at this case and regret buying it! Its terrible! If you are a beginner and looking at this, go buy a Pilot Varsity pen for a few bucks. They are disposable so when the ink is out you can throw it away. The build quality is great and it is a MILLION times better than this GIANT PIECE OF JUNK. The inks are terrible, the nibs dont write, the plastic casings break when you twist and tighten the barrel. Everything is just a giant regret. I think if I dip my finger in an inkwell, I just might write 10x better than this set."
5,Good product,This thing is heavy duty and has a nice wide grip. Anyone at hope who wants to hit the back and lats and is a must since it adds a new angle to your lat pull downs.
4,Good product,"Great wrench for the money. Does 4"" rigid metallic conduit with ease. Some drawbacks are that it only works one way unlike it's Rigid counterpart. Also, the teeth tend to dig into conduit causing it to lock up, but if you beat the bottom of the handle good enough and it will pop right off. Overall, I felt I really got my money's worth."
4,interesting and valuable,"Jan Scholten combines different homeopathic minerals based on a group analysis of the minerals. He gives a brief analysis of the (psychology of the) natrium, ammonium, muriaticum etc.. types. It happens that you find that a person has some characteristics of the natriums but also of the iodums. So why not combine these minerals and give the person natrium iodatum. In his book Jan Scholten explains in detail what every group of minerals means and what their combinations mean. This is a very interesting work illustrated with a lot of detailed cases. Food for thought. An index would be appreciated."
2,Another Insult from BMG Latin!,"First of all I must confess I did not buy this CD. Why should I? It has the same songs that BMG Latin has been serving in one way or another for the past twenty years... If you were to judge Miss Lamarque's extraordinary recording career by these BMG releases you'd come to the conclusion that this artist only recorded two or three songs every ten years! BMG has in its vault the whole Lamarque output but the executives of this firm are so stupid that they don't know what to do with it...It is sad and unfair to music collectors everywhere... If I were not a lady I would tell BMG where to stick this ""Epoca de Oro"" CD."
5,The Last American Cowboy,"I saw this program on Animal Planet at a friend's house. It was a wonderful presentation about the people who are still working ranches and their struggles with nature, economy, weather, and everyday happenings. The photography was superb. I enjoyed it very much and want to get it so I can share it with another friend who grew up in Oklahoma on a ranch."
4,A good general purpose book,This book is a good general pocket pc book. Very easy reading and good information and content. If you are a person who never used a pocket pc or if you had one for awhile this book is for you. I wanted a book that would help me be more efficient using my pocket pc and I wanted to know the in's and out's this book really helped me
1,Sorry,I could not get the vacuum to work very well. It seemed to use most of the battery power in one use. When the bottle seemed sealed the vacuum was not very strong. I have hand pumps for seal wine bottles and they seem to create a stronger vacuum and it dose not take 4 batteries. I would not buy another one.
2,Poor Editing,"The Alaskan Bootlegger's Bible is probably one of the poorest edited books that I have come across in recent time. I felt like I was reading an eighth graders report on distilling. Kania was attempting to describe everything in plain English so that the book had potential to reach more audiences. He does a good job at getting rid of boring, clunky science, but instead chose to fill in the space with pointless banter. The book reads more like a bar-room conversation than a book which was disappointing for me."
2,"ok,,, but title is misleading","this is a good resource for a beginner beer or wine maker,,, but is very light on construction and operation of a still for ""ethanol""."
5,very informative,"this book is great, it describes very thoroughly the whole process of making alcohol with items found very easily. i live overseas, sometimes it is difficult to get a hold of some booze, this book shows how to make it with very common items and ingredients. i would recommend this book to beginner bootleggers."
4,Great book for roughing it... or not.,"I bought this book because it was recomended everywhere I looked. I was looking for information on distilling ethanol. It is loaded with much more information. It is a guide for people trying to manufacture beer, wine, spirits and liquours. It is a great reference and the writer is funny and very knowledgeable. The only downside is that some of the diagrams and photos are dated. They are black and white. They are ok and the book is great. If you are ever stuck in the woods with a book... This is it. If you are looking to make any alchoholic drink from scratch. This is a great start. Also has a ton of recipes to make your favorite liquors from scratch. (Baileys irish cream and Kahlua) Many More. Highly recomended."
4,Great Read if you're into fermenting,"I consider this a must read if you are getting into the hobby of making beer, wine, mead, or whatever. Consider this the blue collar version of making alcoholic beverages. You don't need fancy equipment (but it helps), you don't need to compare your vintage to the floral scents of meadow flowers, you don't have to eat certain wines with certain foods - in fact, you can make wine/fermented beverages out of most anything - milk, in a garbage bag, etc - and this book covers most of these stories/recipes with humorous vigor. Very fun read, and it will get you experimenting with new wines."
1,Too basic,An experienced brewer will not agree with this writer on many things. The title is catchy byt only buy it when you have collect books like makin pure corn whiskey and the compleat distiller. Also moonshine has much accurate info in it
3,Rusting,This curl bar is surprisingly cheap but sturdy. The major problem I've had with it is that it started to rust around the area where you hold it. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Good bar for price,I like the way that this bar handles. It is not too cheap and it has a nice balanced weight to it. The only downside is that it may get corroded in parts eventually but it is a good EZbar for at least two years if you take good care of it. It is the cheapest I have found so far and that is of good quality.
4,Awesome,The product was great. It does exactly as advertised. A great sturdy curl bar. The reason why I have it 4 stars is because the clips that go at the end do not tightly hold the weights in place. But never the less it gets the job done. Highly recommended.
1,Not at all great,"I had ordered this because I had it mixed up with the Stretch Island Original Fruit Leather. My daughter refuses to eat this because of it's taste. I have tried it and I did not like it as well. Don't waste your money, but the original Fruit Leather!"
3,Pans Did Not Fit Properly,"The larger 8"" pans will not sit flush with the range top on my GE drop-in range Model JDC27GL.The smaller 6"" ones do fit properly though. Very strange that one will fit and not the other.Will need to return."
4,Big improvement to the original,"Wow, he actually has articulation now! All four legs have one point of rotating movement. The jaw opens as well. Press the button on the back and the front paw raises and the mouth opens. Tail also has rotating articulation...if you're REALLY that interested. Removable armor comes in four pieces: Helmet/mask, two claw guards for front legs, and main body armor with saddle for He-man. Also comes with two removable missle lauchers which actaully fire. Nice, really nice! You can't have He-Man without his noble steed...er, cat I mean. I recommend it! He looks so cool."
4,ROAR!,He-Man's loyal pet is now modernized. Battle Cat is a great looking toy and compliments the new He-Man and his allies. I recommend it for all fans of the 80s show and the new one coming soon on the cartoon Network.
1,DON'T BUY THESE,"The price was right, but the slippers were not. I've bought these elsewhere for more money and they fit perfectly. The ones I got here were very irregular and practically pinched my toes - same size I always get!! The ultimate insult was sending them back and being charged $4.98 shipping to do so. What a waste of my time and money."
5,Live a Distinctive Life Using Jackie As Your Role Model,"This book isn't about trying to BE Jackie; it's about living your own best, most elegant life, and doing it with dignity and style.The authors are clearly Jackie fans (though they don't hesitate to point out her shortcomings and bad habits), and they respectfully apply a sort of ""Jackie-meter"" to all sorts of topics, such as: grooming, style, makeup, lifestyle, money, men, etc.They also include some personal tidbits about Jackie's life, which, at least to this reader, were interesting.I didn't find the book at all ""gossipy"" (as one of the editorial reviews called it), but rather, I found it a respectful tribute to an icon who was obviously admired by the women who wrote this guide."
5,Laura Reviews: What Would Jackie Do?,"Feel like you've lost that stylish edge? Forget what it's like to have office manners? Unsure of how to deal with family dysfunction? Jackie O knows just what to do.What Would Jackie Do? is a national bestseller and completely hilarious book. Authors Branch and Callaway take every day situations and issues and tell us just how Jackie handled or would handle them. Using observations, research and real-life interviews, this book combines Jackie's reality with answers for us. It warrants a most esteemed book review."
2,Disappointed,"After reading all the reviews I decided to replace our Dirty Dancing Cassette with a DVD and went with this ""longer"" version. However, we were both disappointed. Can't say if it's just because we were used to the ""movie"" version but we just don't like the additional music. Who wants to listen to the ""sister"" sing her talent show song. Gee whiz, I can sing better than that."
1,Awful...just awful,"I bought this pen set at my local Office Depot since I just started teaching myself calligraphy. I wish I had checked on Amazon first and saved myself the money. These pens are just terrible. They do not produce crisp lines, and the ink flow is erratic. I will probably end up throwing them in the trash. If you're looking to use this pen for calligraphy, please do not bother. Buy something else instead of this heaping pile of excrement."
1,does not play,"I recieved my first copy of the Chase and it did not play, I recieved another copy and it still did not play. I had tried it on four different dvd players."
3,Average product,"I'd give this product an okay rating. I purchased it mainly to clean smudges from my children's DVDs. I noticed that it sometimes just spreads the smudges around and I end up using a soft cloth after running it through the cleaner. But having not paid a lot of money for this, it's about what I expected. Figured if it didn't work well, at least it wasn't a huge waste of money."
2,Just Recipes,"The book is OK. It has little to no instruction on how to can or preserve. Just recipes, and mostly fruit. And the recipes are for things that are a bit unusual and exotic. Not really the kind of book I would keep as a staple in my canning library."
3,Serge,"Very good book, i own the 2001 version of it, the only concern i have is that the paper the book is printed on is glossy at some light conditions (rather all the time) it's very hard to read for long time, hopefully the newer versions are better, content is good"
1,Better dont trust this book,"I heard some people saying that they were helped studying from this book but trust me, according to now a days exams this book hardly helps. You can read this once but dont hope that this will help much. No need to buy new edition, its just waste of money. Can get old edition from amazon or ebay...... good luck."
4,A Review 5 Years Later,"In my previous review back in 2005 I only gave one star. Now I am giving 4 stars. The reason is because back then, I was expecting more examples on VBA codes but the book just covers it in a chapter or two. However I am giving 4 stars now because its giving me a good start on topics such as Classes and Collections."
1,"Beware, faulty advertising about the DVD","I ordered this roller expecting a DVD but no DVD I called and they shipped me another roller with no DVD, then they wanted me to send the roller back and I told them since I never got my DVD I wouldn't be sending anything back, so they charged me for another roller and DVD. I am working with my credit card company to show just how crooked this place is. I wouldn't recommend buying anything from this company or Amazon again. They don't stand by their word."
1,Suitable for lumberjacks,"I had to return this item because it is SO wide in circumference that it would only be suitable for someone who is about 6 feet tall and weighs more than 250lbs. I had been looking for a roller to lie on down my spine to help with issues there, like what I use in P.T. At 5'4"" and under 150 lbs, trying that maneuver with this product was like lying on a styrofoam life preserver."
3,Good for 4 months,"Worked well for 4 months, now it has lost its shape. I don't buy the manufactures claims that they ""fixed"" the problem."
3,Problem with DVD box,"The show is great - the narrative is captivating and challenges me to think differently.I bought Season 1 and 2 DVD, but both box hinges, the things that hold the 1st disc, broke. So now I have a loose DVD inside my DVD casing."
1,Warning - get's thick and clumpy,I would not recommend this top coat. After 2 weeks it got very thick and clumpy and I ended up throwing it away.
4,Good resource book just to have,i like the fact that you can see how many foods and spices you eat regularly are good for you and help you. It is a good resource book.
4,Gift Purchase,"Bought this for a friend who could not find it in her local bookstore. She liked it OK, said she thought she improved her overall health."
4,wonderful movie - release on DVD long overdue / uncut??,"This is a DVD on demand (= DVD-R, which will ONLY play on dvd players; ie no PC drive, no dvd recorder etc) coming from MGM.DVD has no menu or extras.Picture looks very good even on 46"" monitor (ie upscaled by BD player + TV)Picture quality: 8.5/10Sound quality: 8/10Aspect ratio: 1.78:1 (1.85:1 orig.)Run time: 1:50'25'' (acc. to imdb.com, an amazon.com-owned website, film orig. runs 112 min??)Chapters: 22Audio: EnglishST: noneRC: 1Bonus: noneASIN: B003B3NV6SStudio: MGM"
5,STILL saving for......sooooooo worth it,"I only have the first season on DVD (due to lack of funds) but have watched EVERY episode on Showtime. It's not the usual type of show I watch but the stories and characters are soooo captivating; I've laughed and cried so many times watching. Sharon Gless, ""Debbie"", should win some type of award every year--her character is brilliant and she plays it so well. On occasion, I can even get my husband to watch and he thinks the story lines are good too. (He gets a kick out of Emmit) This, by far, is my favorite show and I will continue saving my pennies to get all the seasons :)"
4,Let the Journey Begin,"The Writer's Journey by Christopher Vogler is a pleasure to read as well as a fine travel guide for the serious writer. It lays out the map through mystical and mythical lands so that the hero (you) will ultimately arrive at the center of the labyrinth with a tale that is worthy of telling. Written in a way that is understandable, Vogler is the Joseph Campbell of penwrights, melding the mythic story into our modern and post-modern psyche. The artwork scattered throughout the book is very good and lends itself to the process and the journey. This book is especially applicable to those whose interest is in screenwriting, but also has great value to anyone pursuing creative writing."
4,An Excellent Resource for Writers,"If you keep in mind what the author is trying to accomplish, this book makes for a handy tool in a writer's toolbox. This is meant to provide a formula for character development. Minor factual errors aside, it is a starting point for a writer attempting to get a feel for the craft. As such, I think it is a good resource."
3,Interesting Application of Campbell's Work Using Modern Examples,"As someone who applied Joseph Campbell's earlier work to my own 'Virtual Trilogy' of novels ( seeVirtually Maria (Virtual Trilogy)andA Matter of Time) I found this book a useful interpretation of Campbell's theories to the modern medium of film and contemporary novels.However, it is by no means as comprehensive as the original on which it is based and anyone reading it would be well advised (in my view) to read Campbell's work in depth. Nevertheless ""The Writer's Journey"" is a useful addition to any writer's reference library and fun to think of when you are watching any of the movies to which it refers."
5,A Wonderful Resource,"I had the pleasure of hearing Chris speak on February 9 at Westside Pavillion. He speaks as well as he writes. He does a nice job weaving the threads of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell into a tapestry that extends the mythic structure to include film (primarily within the realm of US film making but encompassing a great deal of the world).Understanding mythic structure can also shed light onto our own lives. I have compiled an extensive list of resources available at HolisticNurse.com. If you don't want to search all day here at Amazon.com, visit our site. We have done the ""leg work"" for you. Select a book, and you will be returned to Amazon.com to finalise your purchase."
1,this book limits story & mythmaking,"The problem with this book is that it limits story & mythmaking, ignoring the wisdom of Joseph Campbell, where the author distills lots of his theories from. Joseph Campbell's ideas leave myth wide open, and any stories generated from them. Joseph Campbell saw the call for new myth, particularly in today's world, when the old ones are getting stale and believed with much less passion.Hollywood does not need to repeat the same story over and over. Luckily not everyone does, except for maybe Disney's cartoons. They do it well sometimes, but it is still the same and starts to get boring if you watch any of their movies too close together."
1,To the Vegetarians out there-NOT SYNTHETIC LEATHER,"My rating is based on one thing only: I wanted a synthetic leather watch. This product is described as having a ""synthetic leather"" band so I was definitely surprised when I received the watch and the band said ""genuine leather"". To most people this doesn't mean much but to the people out there avoiding leather, sorry this one's got it.Returning the product was very easy. Amazon's return policy is great."
5,One of the best African collections by far,"Koffi's music is very nice. I would be glad if someone could send me an English version of Loi, I can't read the language that has been used in this CD but love the music so much that I am ready to learn some if there is help. Thank you"
1,disappointed coffee lover,"My husband loves cinnamon and I have tried, time and again, to find good cinnamon coffee...He does not like the flavoring liquid; he wants it in the coffee..So we tried this and it was terrible...it's very strong coffee with an almost non existent cinnamon flavor (which is what I paid for)..I would definitely not buy this again...very disappointed...why is it so hard to get this kind of coffee....."
5,Great dining guide,"We brought this book on our trip and used it frequently. We were very pleased with the book. It was accurate regarding the restaurants, locations, menu selections, and especially pricing."
3,OK,"Not particularly revealing in terms of good buys or good food, lots of fast food type or ordinary foods."
2,Essential for any Maui Vacationer!,"Although I'd been to Maui before, this book revealed many new establishments and all we tried were great. I would recommend this book to anyone traveling to Maui. It pays for itself after the first meal. Don't miss Bale French Cafe in the Mall in Lahaina....it was excellent!"
5,ATARI Thomas and Friends: Trouble on the Tracks (Windows),"I do not know how good this product is because I sent it to our grandson in China, but have not heard anything negative, so assume it is okay. The game came in time for me to send it to China for Christmas so I was very pleased with the service."
1,Not the colour we were expecting...,"Arrived on time and un-damaged...however the colour is not white..it's a beige/brown and looks nothing like the picture shows.Unfortunately there is no option to return this product either, so we're stuck with it."
1,WORST DIET PILL EVER,"I have used this product 4 years ago & it was so-so. I recently bought this product & only used it twice. It is the worst diet pill ever. It made me so sick that I had to stop. I have been having this feeling like my chest in on fire even after I stop taking the pills for 2 days. Please, do not buy that product. You will regret it if you do so."
1,SF 15 Staples are discontinued,"This description mentions that SF 15 staples can be used for heavier duty applications. However what it fails to mention is that not only are they unavailable on Amazon.com.,they are unavailableanywhere - because they have been discontinued! If any one happens to have a box of sf 15 staples around, I will gladly buy them from you for $20 box plus shipping. Why would I do this? Simply because I have a Swingline Saddle stapler in good working order which is designated to use onlythe recommended staples (SF15) which worked great, but sf4's or others will not work at all. Thanks Swingline for a great product as long as one does not need to do any actual stapling."
4,Extreme sound engineering,"This album takes a while to get you into. The difference from the first album is that now the studio work was been taken to the limit, with much more sound layers, details and applied technology. The songs are not as fast as the first CD - hence the name ""ballads"" - however if you love techno-rock you have to buy this album! With Republica and Garbage, the music of the future is available today."
5,A POWERFUL SELF-HELP BOOK,"Here is a book that is simple to follow yet powerful. Self-Hypnosis is an important part of every Hypnotists' training and of every client's therapy ""Self-Change Hypnosis"" is one book that actually shows you how to do it and do it effectively. For a blueprint for rapid personal change, Richard MacKenzie's new book is a must for hypnotherapists.Gil Boyne--Exec. DirectorAmerican Council of Hypnotist Examinersgil-boyne.com"
5,A really good and inspiring read!,This book was such a great read and it is practical as well! Richard MacKenzie's no nonsense approach is so easy to use. It took me just a few hours to read (the important bits) and start working on the practical exercises. I could easily hypnotize myself within about 3 hrs of the courier delivering it!
4,helpful,good basic beginning for dog training - only reason for 4 stars is dvd would be better format. No fault of the product but my vcr ate the tape about 3/4 way to finish.
4,Mind Bending Eye Candy,"As a charter subscriber to Cinefex magazine, the 25-year industry bible for visual effects, I'm no stranger to this topic. But flipping through Pinteau's book yielded some exciting revelations and mostly, It did not disappoint. The book promises interviews with masters ""spanning 100 years"" although it skews pretty heavily to the past decade (not a surprise). But I bought it for the pictures and they made it worth the time and money. The pics are well-chosen and even familiar old films are illustrated with scenes seen less often. I also like the durable hard/soft cover---because I'll be picking this one up frequently."
2,What a disappointment!,"I, too, had thought from the glowing reviews that this would be a great read, especially as I'm very interested in Anne Boleyn. Instead, approximately a third of the way through, I had to abandon it, which I almost never do. The jumping around in chronology made no sense... the bulk of the early section deals with her relationship with Henry, with mentions of Hal Percy but no real explanation. Then it goes into the Percy section. Disorienting and no reason for it...Anne's voice is singularly unpleasant and whiny--her entire refrain is how she's been misunderstood. And the reviews about beautiful, elegant writing? It's mundane, at best.I heartily do NOT recommend purchasing this book, even for $2.99."
1,Glad It Was Only $2.99,"If I had paid any more for this ""book"", I would be really angry. Because of all the glowing reviews, and because I have read all I could get my hands on about Anne Boleyn since the 70's, I was prepared to Love this book. NOT!I very seldom quit a book before the end. This one I gave up at 13% (Kindle). When the author began swinging from life-to-life, here there and everywhere, in every configuration of relationship imaginable (and I DO mean EVERY), she lost me. It became silly, and not worth wasting my time on when there are so many GOOD books out there to read.One star, which means I hate it."
3,"Good product, but can't find it anymore.","This product was recommended to me by my doctor, so I tried it. It worked very well for me. Just a low dosage was all I needed. I particularly liked the caplets, because I could take them with my regular pills. But now I can't find them. Looks like Benefiber is only available now in powder form, but the caplets are not available at all. If the caplets came back I would definitely buy them."
4,Works.. But..,"At the direction of my Gastroenterologist I've taken a fiber product for several years due to GERD. I've used many different products over the years and I prefer Benefiber Non-Thickening Powder to most. I usually take the powder once or twice a day, but when you're in a hurry the ""Benefiber Fiber Supplements Ultra Caplets"" work just fine. They have a somewhat gritty texture like aspirin tablets used to, but this has never been an issue for me. Some people might find them a little hard to swallow, not because of the size of the caplets but their texture. The caplet is comparable in size to most vitamin tablets. I don't feel they work as well as the Benefiber powder, but that might just be a matter of preference. Overall this is a good product for what its intended, to give you extra fiber. One serving of three caplets gives you 3 grams of dietary and soluble fiber at only 15 calories with zero sugar or sodium.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
3,NOT easy to swallow,"They work well at getting you regular, but these things are by no means easy to swallow. I usually don't have trouble swallowing pills, but these get stuck in my throat every time. I stopped taking them because i'm afraid i'll choke one day. I may go with the powder or the chewables. If you have trouble swallowing pills, do not get these."
4,Good introduction to deep diving theory and practices,"Deep Diving is one of the first books to openly discuss the ""taboo"" subject of diving beyond recreational depth limits (>130'). In it Bret Gilliam (founder of Technical Diving International, president of Uwatec USA, former deep-air diving depth record holder) shares wonderful (and gruesome) stories and describes the history and today of the theories and practices of diving deep. This book can help you decide if getting training for deep and technical diving is for you"
4,HOSPITAL BED,HAVING AN ELECTRIC BED IS GREAT ON MY BACK. IT MAKES IT EASIER TO MOVE MY PATIENT AROUND IN THE BED.
3,Commode,This commode was what I ordered. Thank you for offering this. It works well and is helpful for assisting my family member
5,Let U Go - great start!,"Let U Go shows us a side to Ashley that we never got exposed to while he was in O-Town. Ashley had taken off with a brand new hit television series on MTV (There and Back), and now a single which promises great things for his upcoming album release (May 16th). I'd recommend this single to anyone who likes rock music and a great song in general."
1,Dissappointed,"Bought this thinking it would be a fun gag-gift to mess around with. I was interested in the secret to it, but like most magic tricks you're usually instantly disappointed. Unfortunately the key is not a solid key. The teeth at the end of the key are a separate part which is glued on to the stem....and no this isn't part of the effect so I am not revealing anything about the trick. In the description of the trick you're told you can give this key to your audience members for inspection and they will not be able to move the teeth...well all I did was try to move the glued on teeth and those suckers popped right off. I didn't use excessive force, just the same level of manipulation I would expect any curious onlooker to attempt to duplicate the magic trick.It's a piece of overpriced garbage, save your money for the real deal if you come across one in a magic shop. Test before you buy, but do not buy this piece of crap."
3,Easy to fill BUT,"Good feeder, if you don't have squirrels to chew the bottoms of feeder so the feeder won't hold food !"
1,Birds Won't Touch It,"Here is another one the birds just don't like. Since it is another one for clingers, I have to assume we just don't have enough of that type of bird."
4,strange film but good,Red Dwarf Complete Collection (18DVD)I thought I was buying the sci fi ...Somewhat twistedthis film takes on an edge in the way it presents lifeand people. The relatively happy ending was a surprisefor this type of black humor.It is well done but definitely for adults only( most of them will miss the point?).
1,Red Dwarf Series on Netflix,"For all you Red Dwarf fans....if you join NetFlix they have the whole series under ""watch it instantly"" and also to borrow. It is better than nothing if they are not going to release it to DVD."
4,Finally!,"It's about time they get it right. Updated and modern reggae dub remixes that are true to the roots. Not sped up and devoid of groove like Jungle and not watered down to become boring lounge music. This electronic reggae hybrid works, without stripping the soul from the original music. Vols. 1 and 2 are very good, pretty groovin stuff. (I haven't heard vol 3. but it looks good. David from Seattle is an idiot who needs to retake Reggae 101.)"
4,"fun, beautiful work","Since I got in the habit of looking at manhole cover designs in San Diego, where I grew up, I was tickled to come across this title while looking for another book (Omeyagi). I loved it, very interesting and beautiful to look at. Almost inspired me to actually sew something, but I managed to overcome the feeling. I'm not a quilter, but I like to read about quilts and buy them. I recommend this book highly."
1,"Low-quality, leaky, messy oil drain pan","This is the worst oil drain pan that I've ever used. I've purchased multiple of them over the years, as a quick solution, and again, giving the benefit-of-the-doubt. All of them have been messy and have leaked. The drain cap on the spout is a joke. There's no gasket, no seal, nothing other than plastic against plastic (think milk jug); it also cracks on the second or third tightening. The top of the oil drain pan retains a lot of oil. By that I mean that it has a large surface area to clean when you're finished using it, prior to storage. Also, if it is set outside overnight, hope that it doesn't rain or acquite water from condensation as this will be a big mess. And if you forget to screw the middle cap completely (this middle cap is a joke as well, no gasket, no seal, and it breaks easily) then water will contaminate the oil and you can no longer recycle it.If you want a low-quality, leaky, messy oil drain pan, then this one is for you!"
1,bad cap causes leaky oily mess and loss of sanity,"This pan is terrible and not worth the plastic its made out of! Ok, so the engineer that made it did a good job with the large catch area, BUT what the hell is up with the caps? My four year old son could tell you that this screw on cap is not going to seal. Coca cola can make a sealing lid for cheap, but not this company. IT IS NOT DESIRABLE TO HAVE A LEAKY OIL PAN. DO NOT BUY THIS MY FELLOW AMERICANS! IT SUCKS AND WILL MAKE A MESS ON YOUR CONCRETE! Maybe its marketed by jiffy lube....."
1,"Horrible, spills everywhere","I thought I would give this item a chance regardless of the bad reviews, but like everyone here has experienced, this thing totally blows for its purpose, the oil will leak through the crappy plastic cap and the design on top is not deep enough to give the oil to splash inside the pan so it will splash along the top and run along the sides as well. Cheap plastic and the top is not removable."
2,A Mess,"This one leaks, despite only adding 9 quarts of motor oil. The screw top on the nozzle portion of this product leaks, as it is not designed to fully tighten. It's one of those cheap screw top mechanisms that loosens again if you tighten too much. As such, there's a slow drip."
4,Great insider's view|,"Alfredo Parga's storytelling style is more than just of documentary value. His insights on Carlos Reutemann's life, feelings, triumphs and failures, portrait him like no other journalist.This book revalidates Reutemann from the ""second place driver"" status we exitist argentines put him, to nothing short of a ""champion without a crown"".His duels with Niki Lauda, Emerson Fittipaldi, Jackie Stewart and other 70's stars are very well described in a passionate, almost poetic way."
2,"Disappointing, reads like a bad T.V. movie treatment","""Girls"" reads like a combination of the worst of Hemingway, DeLillo, Richard Ford and Raymond Carver. How many times do we have to read about what Jack fed his dog? Or himself? Sections of this book were so lifeless that I thought I was going dyslexic. The backstory involving Jack and Fanny's daughter was particularly irksome, I mean, how can you care about their daughter's death when it is presented to you in such a cautious(or ""literary"") way? The subplot concerning the Vice President's visit was also underwritten and ridiculous. I won't even discuss the incredible lame-ness of the cop-out ending. Busch obviously wanted to write a popular page-turner but chickened out. A book only an NPR listener could love."
5,Girls is Worth Your Time,"I'm not going to overly intellectualize on this. What I've always liked best about Busch is his ability to crystallize the truth of a momentary feeling in domestic human relationships that immediately makes you think it is so obvious you wonder why you never realized it before. And he does it with an unadorned prose that is both sharp and simple.""Girls"" slowly uncovers the pain. desperation, and fear of a few people in the way people themselves (if they're lucky) discover it, after the fact and as if by accident and with some real understanding coming out of it. Many books are (or at least their dust jackets claim them to be) about bleakness leading to hope: this book makes you believe it.Mark Boyer"
4,good book for young girls,my daughter has difficulty dealing with her emotions and this book has helped her to recognise what she is feeling and how to deal with them in a way that i cannot
4,Pretty Good,"As the older sister of a girl almost 13, I thought this book would be a good gift. While the advice is pretty good and sound, the book itself and the illustrations are too young for her. At 12, she is already on to older books. This book is pretty good for 11 and under. But by 12, probably need something more sophisticated."
2,not great,"This book was really not that great. I remember reading one of the stories somewhere else, and the rest were rather predictable. Tilly's Christmas especially I thought was a complete waste of time. Patty's Christmas was O.K., but Patty is just too perfect to be believable. Rosa's story was the one I had read before, and it must have been somewhere else."
1,Ugh... what an awful book.,"An amusing study in narcissism and delusional self-flattery. Jaime Salazar is absurd. He seems to fancy himself a cultured, intellectual, gentleman soldier but the bullsh** in this book is so shamefully thick that instead he comes across as a rather pitiful, self-conscious and insecure man-child. Seriously, this book is a farce."
1,Do not listen to this book!!!!,"I wouldn't go so far as to place blame upon the author; however, the story telling is heavy skewed in the writers favor. Please do not consider this book to be representative of life in the Legion or the 2REG."
4,A great local artist,"Greg has done a fantastic job on this CD. His true talent has come through in a combination of county, folk, and rock. Every song on this CD is great, each one of them touching home. Greg has put his heart and soul into the words of each and every number. My personal favorite is Solomon. The only bad thing about this CD is it's not long enough !!"
3,Less than advertised,"These sardines are fair to good. A little mushy for my taste, but nice flavor. My shipment was NOT Spanish sardines. The word ""Spanish"" is not on the box and in fact the sardines I received are a product of Morocco. Must admit I was a bit disappointed. I'll probably try these again and hope for the real thing."
3,Traveler has little saynd and leaves you dangling,"Before you buy this book,know that it is the ""first"" of the fourth realm books. I haven't found the second or third. It is a good read. I found it when it was recommended as a Summer Read on NPR. The characters could be filled out a bit better and the author's obvious obsession with the evil side of the information age gets a little tiresome near the end. But it leaves you wanting to read the next installment. I hope there is a next book.=30="
1,Mildly Entertaining,"I'll let others describe the plot and action. I'll concentrate on character and dialog: THERE IS NONE! These characters are thin and unbelievable in every thought and action. The dialog is simply pathetic. I have a feeling this Twelve Hawks (Hey everybody, I'm off the grid!) is probably a group of high school sci-fi nerds who got together and figured out how to write a cheap novel, get publishers to write phoney praises, and with luck (depending on how you look at it) sell the rights to hollywood.I realize one cannot expect too much from this genre, but COME ON! Don't praise that which clearly is nothing more than formulaic plot and action. There are some real writers of this genre out there and are well worth researching.Save your money and reread The Foundation."
5,A Completely Entertaining Book,"Hey, this may not be the best written book in the world but it is one of the most entertaining that I have read in years. THE TRAVELER is a story that was impossible to put down and I can't wait for the next book. This book and THE HEAP go on my list as the best two of the year. If you want stories that glue you to the page these are for you. P.S. Maya is a character that no doubt will end up on the big screen."
1,"Travelers usually go to exciting places, but not in this book...","I trudged through this book, constantly asking myself why I was bothering. It is loaded with gratiutous and childish screenplay violence. It reminded me of the narratives I created in my mind when I played with G.I. Joes as a kid. I stuck with it because of the promise of the main characters actually ""traveling"" to other worlds.I was rewarded with a cheap B movie rendition of the Travelers destinations instead of an imaginative take on the possibilities of other realms and dimensions. In Hawkes' mind other dimensions are filled with blood-thirsty zombies that have a commercial economy based upon selling empty boxes. Hawkes is trying to create a metaphor reflecting our society, but fails miserably for lack of both creativity and subtelty."
3,a good start,"This book is pretty good, but it's potential is not built on or lived up too. The second book is even weaker and taints the first."
5,"Good Book, Good Topic","It took me a chapter to understand where this book was going. But once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It was interesting, and it was unique. The topic and idea of it made me think. It seems so real, the idea that we are being watched every moment by the Vast Machine. It is a quick read, and the only issue with the book, is that it ends with you knowing that there has to be another book. Excellant. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"Keep on moving, nothing to see here.","I enjoyed the hype around this book, purported to be a global mystery/thriller with mystical elements. However, the story itself, burdened by overlong exposition, stilted dialogue, and more promise than payoff in terms of epiphany and pacing, leaves much to be desired. Despite the advertised trilogy to come, the only real mystery that holds any interest for me regarding this book is the identity of the author, who, I am glad to say, will not read this review, living off the grid and all. My guess as to authorship is a committee of recent college grads, full of big ideas, but unable to deliver a story with emotional impact and spiritual import. The words, more often than not, get in the way, rather than making the way for the reader. For those willing to move on to something better, I recommend reading Tim Powers instead."
2,"Dull, Trite, and Poppy","This book came well-recommended, so I was surprised when it became painful to pick it up again for a chapter before bed. It attempts to walk a line between poppy political thrills, martial arts adventure, and magical fantasy. It fails to do anything original on all fronts, and becomes amazingly dull in the process. The book is paced too slow with no redeeming writing, description, etc to justify its tediousness. The characters seem to have critical switch-points but don't actually develop, the plot is distressingly linear given the subject-matter and genre, and the concept is also surprisingly unimaginative given the breadth of ideas in the genres he straddles. The only thing that can be said for it is that it's easy enough to read that you could probably manage it handily on an airplane."
3,Matrix Meets Jason Bourne,"As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the first Matrix and Bourne movies, I should have enjoyed this novel; however, while it does everything reasonably well, it does nothing to a truly satisfying degree, particularly characterization.The characters could be compelling if they weren't somewhat two-dimensional. The plot could be gripping if it were slightly more complex. The tone could be suited to the plot if it were lighter and thus in keeping with the level of the characterization and plot. As is, this book is neither a beach read nor an intricately interesting sci-fi/spy thriller. However, if you are both a die-hard sci-fi AND spy novel fan, you may very well enjoy it.If, as it happens, you are also a fantasy fan, I would recommend R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing series instead. This book reminded me of it somehow, despite it's modern and ""real world"" setting, but Bakker crafts a much more compelling effort by all the criteria above."
1,Very shallow and overrated,"I picked up this book at an airport expecting a good read based on a favorable book review in The Washington Post. From the beginning, I was disappointed in the writing (which was very passive and elementary--I wanted to rewrite almost every sentence), the predictable violence and the lecturing about surveillance use.After I finished the story, I realized how shallow this story really is. The ""traveler,"" who is supposed to be protected by a violent ""harlequin,"" is compared to past travelers who were prophets. However, neither traveler in this book (one an evil brother and the other a good one) had anything charismatic or prophetic about them. Instead, they both seemed incredibly selfish. Where is the compassion, the foresight, the message behind these travelers?The last page stated that this book is part one in a series. If this is what it takes to become a successfully published author nowadays, I consider it a crying shame."
4,A wonderful summer weekend read...,"I just finished The Traveler after having surprisingly found it at a local shop. It's a fast read (I began it on a Monday, finished it on Tuesday). If you're looking for a jolly good read for a summer weekend, dive into this one. There's plenty of action to keep you glued to each page. The parallels with today's actual goings-on can be sometimes frightening or enlightening, depending on how you view today's society. Let's just say, I'm ready for Book Two of the Fourth Realm.Since the selection of television programs is so dismal this season, click off the tv and open the door to The Traveler. You'll have a good time and perhaps think a little along the way."
4,So cute!,"My daughter loves them. They are so cute, we purchased the pink ones. They seem comfortable on her feet...and she can be picky. The soles are very flexible. The boots seem to scuff easily, but otherwise we are happy with the purchase. I bought her regular shoe size and they fit fine."
2,like rubber,"These boots were ok. They are not leather at all. When I opened the box, I was overwhelmed by the scent ot rubber. The pictures of products can be very misleading. The boots were cheaply made."
4,Pink western boots,"These boots have been a huge hit, they made one little girl very happy. She never wants to take them off."
2,Poorly assembled college text,Many chapters ramble on with insignificant facts making it difficult to see what point the author is trying to make. Typographical errors are abundant due to insufficient editing and proofreading. I recommend schools find a different text to ethics in technology courses.
2,Huge Discrepencies,"The supreme instructions of Krishna are given in the final chapter's final verses: 18:64 to 18:71.They are his supreme instructions because he himself says so in verse 18:64 i.e. 'sarva guhyatamam bhuyah shrunu mae paramam vachah' which is 'Listen to my supreme, most confidential (deep) instruction'.Anyone with some sanskrit knowledge can tell that the above is an accurate translation.Mr. Easwaran waters it down completely:These are the last words I shall speak to you, dear one.Is this crazy or what?!!!! Mr. Easwaran, what was the point of translating the Gita and screwing it up at the climax?I give it 2 stars since Easwaran's gita is better than having no Gita. I wasted my money and I whole-heartedly recommend the hare-Krishna 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is'"
2,More than what I wanted,There is a long preamble to each chapter. It detracts from the poetry and flow of the Gita itself to the point that the message looses its strength. What a pity! To read the Gita alone in its entirety requires a lot of skipping which not easy to do with a Kindle. Any discussion should have been put at the end.
4,i found christ true name!!,the one christians call Jesus is actually named Savior/Deliverer in the hebrew its Yashayah from Yasha hebrew strongs 3467 or in Hosea 2:16 Ishi!!! and the most high name is Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh/Ahayah Exodus 3:14 and the holy spirit Ruah Hakodesh Shalom!
3,Shakespeare at Home,"It's good to be able to watch these plays in the comfort of my own home. One problem I've noted thus far -- the audio is uneven. Production values vary from scene to scene. Sometimes the volume must be increased significantly to hear the lines, and then the volume changes and the shouting begins."
2,Author with No Chess Credentials,"The Author Pafu have no chess credentials that I can locate through USCF, FIDE or any of the other well know chess Federations or Societies.The system of openings has some practical value but can easily be met by applying the standard stratigic formulas of both Classical and Hypermodern. I have tested many of the author's sample lines and have found that in almost every example, the opponent, facing the ""Beginner's Game"" theory, is a computer that does not respond with the best move. I have found many better moves simply by allowing my program (Fritz 8)to think for a reasonable period, and BINGO, a better move is generated. Certainly better than the book gives the hapless opponent. No illustrative games against strong Master players are given. No illustrative games against humans are given!It is my believe that this system can be easily refuted by any true Chess Master."
4,Planning a tea party,This item looks great! It arrived promptly and in great condition as described. Having a Mat Hatter's tea party in October and it was ordered for the party!
3,Disappointed customer,"When we received the television, the stand was bent, therefore the television was leaning forward. When we called sony to fix the problem under the in home warranty; we were told that it was damaged during shipping and that we would have to pay to have the part replaced. When we called amazon for the second time, we were told that we had to wait to receive an e-mail from the electronics department to see what they could do. This entire process has been very disapointing. After waiting over a month to receive the television and then being told that we had to pay to get it fixed has just left a sour taste for buying electronics online."
5,Loud and Clear,"I added this indoor Siren to my current alarm system because I only had an Outdoor siren. This baby will wake the dead, scare the intruder, and give you time to get the gun and take care of buisness. Very satisfied with this product! Amazon once again delivered within 5 days, no problems."
5,"Honestly, One Of The Best","I'M A SLOW and FINICKY READER, BUT I LOVE TO READ JUST THE SAME. MANY BOOKS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO KEEP MY ATTENTION, & WHEN I FIRST PICKED-UP ""DANSE MACBRE"" IN HIGH SCHOOL (years ago), I COUNLDN'T SIT THROUGH IT. HOWEVER, JUST FOUR MONTHS AGO (6 YEARS LATER), I DECIDED TO TRY MY HAND AT IT ONCE MORE. I'VE READ KING OFF AND ON FOR YEARS. IN FACT (from what I hear), I'VE REALLY ENJOYED HIS ""NOT-SO-POPULAR"" TITLES. SO MAYBE THIS ISN'T GOING TO CONVINCE TOO MANY OF YOU TO CHECK IT OUT ;). OH...WELL... YOU'D BE MISSING A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY..."
2,Rambling and egotistical,"King at his worst.Stephen King has produced works of utter genius but this is one to avoid. It is rambling, egotistical conceited."
2,Uncovered,"I am a currently collecting all Stephen King books and only hardcovers. When I purchase a hardcover I expect it to have a a book jacket or paper cover, but unfortunately I received my book without one. Although the book was in great condition, the description should tell whether or not the book jacket is with it or not. When I think of good or like new description for a hardcover, I expect the jacket to be with it."
1,SK I hope you will forgive me - I can't just can't do it,"I've read everything published that Stephen King has written. I've dug up stuff that wasn't published that he's written and read that. I've read reviews, followed newsgroups, chatted online and surfed and/or researched Stephen King until I thought my eyes would pop out of my head and run screaming down the road on their stems.. but this book, I just can't get it down. I've owned it for nearly as long as it's been in print and I have tried to read it with serious intent on no less than six different occassions. I have yet to ever make it through successfully. It patently bores the crap of me. I have never made it more than halfway through. I do not recommend this book to even the most avid SK fan. I just ain't worth it folks. You'd have to be a Xenobyte to find reading this enjoyable"
5,Christmas gift,"Gave this as a Christmas gift to my daughter, who watches every issue of Make it or Break it that is out on dvd over and over again."
5,Benjamin Franklyn costume,I was very happy with the custume. Everything arrived on time. The play was great. My grandson was the STAR of the play.
2,"Cute costume, poor customer service","I got this costume for my son's colonial day project. I ordered a large, but the company sent a medium costume in a package marked as large. Amazon customer service was very helpful in trying to help me resolve this issue, but ultimately could do nothing but refund my money since they did not actually fill the order. They gave me a phone number to the company the costume came from. I left several voicemails, but no one ever called me back, so I had to return the item. It was cute and would have looked good for the project, but the frustration of trying to get correct size that was ordered was not worth the hassle."
3,I liked Lucas...,"Amelia, not so much. I also found myself far more intrigued with the letters between Charlotte and Michael at the beginning of each chapter than with what was going on in the rest of the story. Obviously a set-up for a new series; hopefully, there's going to be one focusing on Charlotte and Michael."
1,Save Your Money,"Please do not waste your money on this DVD, unless you want to watch 15 minutes of an Oprah-like woman in front of heavy drapes, performing standard techniques on a mammoth dil.In the right crowd, this might make a hilarious, end-of-the-party video to put on the tube. It reaches a surreal, almost dada form of weirdness.But as a video to learn technique from, it's nearly useless, cheap, a complete rip-off.BTW, the opening sequences appear to be shot in Chicago. Look at the other rave reviews... from Chicago. Coincidence?"
1,Unintentionally comical ...,"The author seems mindlessly materialistic, which her year-long experiment doesn't do much to change. A better title for this book would be ""A Year Where Though I Cut Back on a Few Luxuries, I Continue Spending More Than Most Working Stiffs.""Would love to see her in a celebrity boxing match with Amy Dacyczyn, author of ""The Tightwad Gazette."" I'll take Amy in Round 1."
2,Disappointed,Did not like the political nature of this book. I had hoped for a more emotional tale about going without extras. I must admit to skimming through the political and statistic sections which made it a quick read.
1,Embarrassing and hypocritical,"This is easily the most embarrrasing, hypocritical book I've read. I want to stop reading, but it's like watching a car accident. The jaw-dropping gall of this woman increase with every page! I seriously thought she was a young 20-something (and I seriously apologize to those in their 20's for that) until she tells us she's in her 50's.Just an example of what her book consists of:She has the nerve to poo-poo people's choice of driving an SUV or owning a snowmobile, yet fails to really see the hypocrisy of the fact that she owns two! (nicely remodeled)houses (40+ acres for two people!) and three cars! Really there is little difference lady between a Subaru wagon and an SUV. Especially for someone without children.This book is exactly why the right dislikes the left. As someone who veers left, this really bothers me."
2,Thought this was a book about doing without...not a political rant.,"Enough with the corny post 9-11 political puns. I'm only on page 5 of the book and I'm already exhausted...and losing interest.Oh, and I'm so glad I have this book to inform me that we are using 20 times the resources that we did in 1900. Gee, ya think? So informative! And not the least bit obvious! Hopefully this book will filled with even more gems and revelations."
1,Eschew consumerism,Begin to lessen your consumer footprint by not buying this preachy and frivolous book.
1,Liberalism Hits a New Low,"""What a wonderful concept for a book!"", I thought. Judith Levine turned her great idea into a soap box for blaming conservatives for EVERYTHING! And what's with the foul language in the book? She's a writer, for heaven's sake - she needs to learn she's not the only one offended by having one's morals belittled by others. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Too late i already bought it.,"When I bought this book I was hoping for a little light reading, maybe a few good ideas on econimizing, perhaps a little humor. Well forget that, if you want to be preached at and harangued this book delivers.Ms. Levine isn't a bad writer, but this book is very dry and humorless.The lack of real world advice on how to live on the cheap was disapointing. Quite a bit of the book is devoted to eating all natural healthy foods. Which may save money, but long passages are devoted to zealots who take the concept to the extreme. Unless your already a true believer these parts are fairly tedious. The eccentrics who live this lifestyle seem to be a pretty smug self content group, thus not very compelling.Not Buying IT does have some interesting and thought provoking parts,(making it a two star book) but overall much of the book is repititve polemic."
2,a big disappointment,"Reading another review, I thought this book would be a personal exploration of what shopping really means to an individual (e.g. a purse isn't just a purse; it's a longing for identity). Instead, the book was more just a simple diary of her activities for each month of the year, preceded with a diatribe against George W Bush and society in general, and peppered with references to studies & books she read about consumerism. I was so turned off & taken aback by the self-righteous ramblings of this author that I never bothered to read the whole book. If you're of the same mindset, then go for it. Otherwise, don't spend a penny on this book."
2,"Weird Political Polemic, Not Thoughtful Consumer Commentary","This book is mostly a rapidly-becoming-dated political screed about the author's feelings about the president, conservatives, and capitalism. She spends more time flogging the Bush administration than she does exploring her own assumptions about which aspects of her own lifestyle count as ""necessary"" and which are ""luxuries"" afforded to her by the privileged place she occupies in society. Even if you share her political views, the book doesn't have much to offer, because her musings aren't particularly interesting or well-written. All in all, this book was a disappointment."
2,Huh!,"I really thought the premise of this book was great.Unfortunately, the writing was not. Actually the writing was good, but completely out of place within the subject matter.It felt to me as though this book could not make up its mind about exactly what it was supposed to be.Part memoir, part waxing poetic about everything from money to socks to Bush.I would have preferred that the author simply either:a) write a straightforward memoir about her experiences with this experiment or:b) sell this book as more of a philosophical/social commentaryUnfortunately, the combination of the three just does not work and I lost interest partway through.Don't bother with this one."
3,It is interesting,"""Not Buying It"" is an interesting concept, but I don't believe that Judith Levine has detailed her journey in the most entertaining way. I just couldn't sympathize with her challenges as she tried to complete a year without buying anything. I guess I thought it would be funnier or more intriguing. This is a book that I keep putting down. I like books that I can't put down. So I'm only giving it 3 starts."
1,Hated It,This book is not good at all. I could not get pass page 5. Ms. Levine talked more about political issues and her traveling. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,it's ok,"This thermometer took my little one's temperature fine. I bought this for the compact size but when the battery ran out, I didn't have time or remember to get the special battery that it needs. i read about the battery before I bought it but I didn't think it would bother me until of course the battery died. Ran an bought a regular sized thermometer that takes AAA batteries."
2,Reads Like a Doctoral Thesis,"A fascinating and socially important case, but yikes, this is a dry and wordy book! Amazingly, the author never tells us what happened to the ""heroine"" after the trial--did she die? When? How? Is she still alive, and some 160 years old? Get it out of the library and skim it if you're interested in French political history, but this is not a book you can buy to read over and over."
4,A Dictionary of Informal Brazilian Portuguese,"This book has lots of fun slang and is fun to read because of the sample phrases thrown in. Unfortunately, it was published in 1983, so a lot of the modern slang isn't in there. I can usually find about half of the slang I hear. So far, I think it's the only widely available dictionary of it's kind."
3,"Great beginner's guide, not for the experienced trader","Starting of with the positives, this is a great easy read for those with no prior experience in technical analysis. Explanations and examples are simple and straight forward. The basic tools are heavily emphasized here. Book is deceptively long because the text type is quite large. Some diagrams are not easy to read.This book, unfortunately, is not for the intermediate trader. There is too much emphasis on simple trends and outof date wave analysis. More current topics (such as oscillators and divergence analysis) are only briefly touched on. This is not a reference type book but more of an introduction to technical analysis...still a good read."
4,Technical Analysis,Very good book for introduction to technical analysis. Was a requirement for one of my finance courses: Trading in financial securities.
5,Great turning point book,"With two years of study in the markets I've started to have some decent results but now that I've read & outlined the first 263 pages of this 800 page book I'm able to get 75% to 287% returns in 2-4 days. Some shorts, some longs, all by buying the option on the right day and getting out 2-3 days later. Yes, this book is originally written in 1950 or so but is the gold standard in the industry. This is one of four books [...] suggests to pass the test to be MTA certified. This is not an easy book to read as it is like a college textbook. Sit down in a chair at a table with a pencil and laptop and take many notes. But after only 263 pages I'm showing nice results & want to read the rest.Caution - This book alone is not the answer. You need to know your platform, common sense rules of trading, and ALWAYS, limit your risk or you'll be one of the fallen. If you limit your risk you're halfway there. Good luck."
2,Too general for its price,It has some good basic general lessons but I feel it's a quick rush-through by the author. One can get plenty of more detailed technical analysis education free online.It's an expensive book. I bought it because I read the 5-star comments. I gave two stars as I was looking for a lot more.
5,Raised my energy level,"Noticed I had much more energy and was in a better mood within a few days of taking these. Also noticed a decrease in appetite. Win,win."
3,Mr,"The video card is not suitable for windows vista, also if want it working properly you must put it 4gb ram, plus a new hardrive spinning at 7200 RPM, or it works very slow, also the processor runs extremely hot and at 2,2 ghz it can barely keep up, the touchscreen feature is so inacurrate that is not useful (they should develop something like multitouch of machintosh)."
4,Not for Video,"I love the size weight etc....But the processor cannot handle videos. Even though it states it is an ""entertainment notebook pc"" forget playing back dvd's, it can't handle it! The playback is choppy at best definately not watchable, speakers suck (hey, it is a notebook). It takes ""FOREVER"" to boot. Otherwise I like the size,weight and flexibility."
1,Touchscreen,"When I bought this computer I saw a picture the show a digital pen, so I understood that is a touchscreen computer. Why do you show a picture like that if we can not use digital pen? I am very frustred..and I am trying to talk with you, and nobody answer me back."
2,Computer defect - exhaust fan too hot,The computer is nice from a design point of view but has a fatal flaw. the heat from the exhaust fan is so hot that you can't put it on your lap for any period of time.
1,"IT WILL DIE ON YOU, DONT BUY",I bought the HP TX1120US from Amazon in 2007 and it died last month. Laptops from HP suffer a fatal design flaw and the motherboard will DIE. Do NOT EVER BUY ANOTHER HP product. THEY WILL SCREW YOU IN THE END. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT YOU AFTER THEY MADE $.
2,Doesn't hang all the ideas together well,"Useful book for getting familiar with initial syntax and semantics of UML, but I found did not manage to connect the ideas between the types of diagrams together well.Use of more real world examples would have helped."
3,It worked,"It was as expected. Had I opted to spend more the notes would have been helpful. Type is small, so if you wear glasses, you will be using them."
2,Disappointed. Print it too small.,I expected to be able to read the print as we caroled but it is way too small. Song selections are ok.
5,A great CD,Purchased this for my husband as he has wanted it for years. Now I understand why. This lady can sing light jazz. Now I want a copy of my car.
5,What little I've heard is wondrous and silky,"I know this CD from only one track that appeared on a sampler CD from CD Review magazine a zillion years ago. If the rest of the album is like this track, what a splendid alternative Nutcracker this is! Soaring and beautiful, rich and mellow; I do hope this CD becomes easily available!"
4,Great Cheap Snow Brush,This is an item that will not stand the test of time...however it will get the job done for a few seasons and only costs 1.99 right now..No Brainer! Thanks Amazon
1,Cheap Quality,"The sled we received was different than the one pictured. It tore in two different places the first time we went sledding with it, rendering it unusable. Don't buy it."
5,Awesome book set,"These were my all time favorite books as a child! I read the ones I had so many times, they literally fell apart. I got this set for my daughter, and will be picking up another for my nephews. I looked for the set several years ago at book stores, for my oldest nephew, and didnt find it. Thank you Amazon!!! Amazing stories! I'm reading them again right now on my Kindle!!This particular box set was brand new, in perfect shape, and came with a nice big fold-out map. Too cool!! Definitely picking up another one!!"
3,Comfortable to wear but the ice pad is too small,"The construct of this elbow wrap is comfortable and the Velcro provides secure and custom fit, so it's good for people with, say tennis elbow ailment. But the ice pad is too small so it lost its cooling effect after about 20-30 min. I wish they have a bigger ice pad. I haven't tried the hot therapy yet--you are supposed to use the ice pad for heat too. You need to heat it up in hot water, and can't heat it up in microwave. So it's a bit cumbersome and I kind of doubt if the ice pad is really meant to be used for heat anyways.Oh, there is NO magnet whatsoever provided with wrap, so the title ad is misleading, or outright lie in other words."
5,Great Game!,"At first, I wasn't sure... but once I got used to the battle system (and turned the voice tracks off!) I was hooked! By playing special combinations of cards I created powerful new cards for attacking and curing. I leveled my players up, so defensive cards could be kept to a minimum in their decks. I took pictures of enemies and sold them for a neverending supply of money. I fought each enemy until I had plenty of the best magnus it dropped. I completed every sidequest I encountered to receive even more magnus. I aimed for discovering all 1000+ varieties of magnus cards. Baten Kaitos has so many layers... This game is awesome."
1,The Kindle edition linked is not the Freake-Tyson edition,"Amazon needs to stop linking Kindle editions to printed texts that are different from these printed editions, as if they were equivalent. Especially in case of translations, where the edition is often paramount."
1,WTH is wrong with Amazon?,"Why is Amazon (Warehouse Deals) charging $435.60 for a used 10 year old iPod? That's just crazy. It was definitely worth that much 10 years ago - but that's more than a NEW warrantied iPod Touch with a color screen, WiFi, apps, more solid state storage that won't wear down like a hard drive, and is considerably lighter than this boat anchor. Oh and this is FireWire ONLY which is just useless in 2012. This has to be some kind of pricing error."
5,Close your eyes and enjoy the music,"This CD is full of beautiful, quiet, and reflective music. Mr. Wood's talents as a composer and guitarist are phenomenal."
5,Inspirational new music!,"As a servicemember who has deployed to the middle East, this was one of the best representations of the experience put to music I've come across. Very Cool."
3,already copped these jams,I love georghe clinton and p funk but I want new material not the same old greatest hits compilations by folks who just wanna cash in on his name.
5,Great Overview of Right to Die Issues,"This book provides a concise overview of the issues arising from the right to die, the politics and law behind those issues, and the reasons all American's should be worried about the Religious Right's efforts to forcibly impose their own brand of morality on all Americans."
4,Very Economical For Low Minute Users,"The Tracfone Nokia 5180 is a good choice if you want a simple to use, inexpesive phone. I find tracfone's customer service to be improving and their website is good enough for my needs. That said...if you want a phone for occasional or emergency use and don't want to pay $+ a month, there is no better choice. I keep mine active for around $ a month. ..."
3,"THE BEST SALSERO, BUT NOT HIS BEST WORK!!!","I AM PROBABLY THE BIGGEST AND MOST LOYAL GILBERTITO FAN. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT UNLESS YOU ARE A DIE HARD FAN, YOU MAY WANT TO SKIP THIS ONE. POR LA HERIDA DE UN AMOR, AND HABLANDO CLARO (SALSA VERSION) ARE ABOUT THE BEST THIS CD HAS TO OFFER. I THINK GILBERTO HAS TO GET OMAR ALFANNO BACK TO WRITING HIM HIS TRADEMARK SONGS AND THAT WILL REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. DON'T GET ME WRONG HE IS STILL THE MAN, THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER CABALLERO DE LA SALSA. BUT HE NEEDS TO RETHINK HIS CHOSING OF SONGS WHICH WILL CONTINUE MAKING HIM THE BEST."
2,Avoid this book!,"Since I own a lot of VideoHound books and am a fan of Independant films, I decided purchase this book. Bad idea. The author is an elitist snob. She is constantly dropping names. When she reviews a movie, most of the time she will tell you that it reminds her of another, more foreign sounding movie. It is written with a complete lack of humor that is so pleantiful in other videohound guides. If you don't believe me, read her overbearing, femminist review of ""A Boy & His Dog."" In short, this book exemplifies everything that I hate about ""independent"" (read: multimillion dollar-artsy films with no immagination) movies. Its a cold, sterile entry into the otherwise great VideoHound library. The only redeeming value it has is the wonderful indexes that has become a VideoHound trademark."
4,"A original concept, from a new author with a vision","Wow! A sharp and perceptive vision of our world today. Original ideas and approaches to today's world problems as they might really be dealt with. A must-read thriller that will take the reader on a captivating ride of political, military, and world intrique. This story takes place in our near (or almost present) future and tells about new agency built by the US to conteract the threats of terrorism, as well as dealing with general crime on a world-wide basis. Deals with our New World Order and the threats we all face. I'm really looking forward to the next in this 'Max Stone' series!"
4,"Well written, and easy to follow.","I like the way the story line is written, plus the way the author made it easy to follow, and for someone like me to understand the high tech within the story it was a great read.Looking forward to reading the next installment of the series.I give it four (4) cocoanuts out of five (5)."
3,"An entertaining read, with a rather disapponting finale","The House of Sleep is a well-written book, with a clever plot, in which students which used to live in the same house, somehow get involved with eachother 12 years later. The odd-numbered chapters are set mainly in the years 1983-4 and the even-numbered in June 1996. The characters are certainly likeable, although somewhat one-dimensional. In June 1996 things slowly build up to a climax through a number of accidental encounters. Although the author thinks up surprising faiths for each of the main characters, the whole thing becomes too far-fetched in the end."
2,A resoundingly okay read,"The descriptions of college life and young love are well done, though no more dicey or cutting-edge than ""St. Elmo's Fire."" The ""surprise"" that the narrative hinges upon, however, is not much of a surprise -- the only reason my jaw dropped in astonishment was because Mr. Coe actually had the cojones to employ such a hoary conceit. (He also uses the letter-stuck-in-a-book-and-reappearing-at-a-pivotal-moment-twenty-years-later trope, with greater result; but without a trace, a smidgen of the wicked irony that dripped from ""What A Carve Up!"")"
5,Wonderful French music of the era of Louis XIV,"The music was used for the film Tous les matins du monde, and it played a central role in the film itself. The performance captures well the style of the time."
2,Not so sure!,"I have read the book and followed all the advice as far as what to eat and what not to eat in this book, some information may be valid, but as far as what the author is saying, basicaly, eliminate all wheat based food... well maybe it works for some people but for me, I HAVE NOT LOST A POUND since on this diet...I have been on this diet since a month + so when the author is saying that one aquaintance lost 5 lbs the first week i am wondering if this book is for real or is it just plain fiction ?!"
2,Had some trouble with ours.,"I had an Ademco Lynx REN system that I installed myself more than seven years ago. Programming it was tough, but not impossible and in general, the system worked well for us. We had the talking version and the audio for that function stopped working about two years ago. No more audible warning beeps to disarm the system upon entering, etc. I recently upgraded our panel to the Lynx Touch, which still supports my 5800 series transmitters, but found the Lynx Touch SIGNIFICANTLY easier to set up, program and use than the controller featured here. I cannot recommend this unit given the audio failure. Buy a Lynx Touch instead."
1,Misleading,"Be very careful that you are not mislead as I was about compatibility with Honeywell's Total Connect software. This software claims to allow full control of your alarm through both an Internet and Iphone app. Once you sign the contract and install the software you will find that all that works is a basic remote keypad. ALL of the other features that Honeywell demos in their videos and brochures do not work. I repeat ALL of the other features do not work. Do not expect to configure devices, event notification, x-10 devices. Of course Honeywell Ademco will not talk to you because they only talk to alarm dealers. You will find this out after hours of trying to make it work and then an apology from a salesman."
1,UNCLEAR DVD.,"I ORDERED THE WHALES OF AUGUST BECAUSE MY MOTHER LOVES THE FILM, BUT THE DVD WAS SO UNCLEAR, IT COULDN'T BE APPRECIATED. IT HAS SINCE BEEN RETURNED, AND I AM STILL WAITING TO BE REIMBURSED."
2,too thin,"While I like the look and the features that make it easy to get a sweaty glove off, the padding is just too thin. After wearing out an old pair of gloves, within two weeks of using these I was peeling calluses off my hands. This would be a great glove for light lifters, but it's not for meat heads."
4,Good Product!!!,"Good quality product, very sturdy...just be aware that sometimes (like in my tower) the frame is not perfectly square (pull ups handle bar is not level, same with dips handles)...overall its a good product!!!"
1,Holes drilled on wrong side of uprights,"The manufacturer (which apparently is Keys Fitness and not Ironman) drilled ALL the holes on the SAME side of the upright support tubes, which made it impossible to assemble. The assembly instructions clearly show holes on different sides of the uprights. The telephone support line took three different calls of at least 8 to 10 minutes each to get through. I explained the problem and they want me to send them a picture of the defect before they'll send out the replacement parts. Very disappointing."
3,Bad experience!!!!!,"Great globe but the musical mechanism didn't work. Obviously wasn't checked before despatch!!!!! Now have to pay repair bill on top of delivery charges ( which were higher than the cost of the product) and a further 19 import costs. All in all an expensive experience!!!!!!!! To top it off, it's now available on UK site."
4,A Fun & Easy Read,"THE SECOND COMING OF LUCY HATCH is definitely not a challenging book to read, but then I seldom read anything too challenging. I want something to entertain me without insulting me as a reader. This novel does just that. Sure, it's predictable and most probably it's close to being one of those romance novels I generally shun, but it's well written and has a certain charm to it that appealed to me."
3,Boring,"Marsha Moyer is a great story teller, but I found this book a little boring and the ""turning point"" rather dull. Lucy wasn't terribly likable and the only connection I could see between Ash and Lucy was sex. I felt like I was reading a Reader's Digest condensed version of a truly great book."
5,Excellent shovel,Great shovel--strong handle for all jobs. Lightweight plastic scoop makes for easy lifting for my elderly father. Mostly used for snow removal.
3,Enlightening,"Looks like the people envolved with making this book made a concerted effort to not polish and ""clean up"" Shirley point of view. It gives you a real insight when you read between the lines about why Shirley was running around match racing while the rest of the NHRA superstars were racing in front of thousands and making tons of money. The whole book was about who she had problems with and why. Looks like she had a real inability to look at things from any one elses view point and realize that people are motivated by their own situation. Just because that may put them at odds with you doesn't mean they are bad people or as she puts it ""need to change"""
1,Disgusting,"First of all the taste and texture of these things are sickeningly like leather dissolving in your mouth.Second, if you are looking for a CHERRY fruit product, keep looking. These are made from, ""Apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor.""BIG MISTAKE to purchase these ""Original Fruit Leather"" products."
4,"Sleek, but can't run component in and HDMI out.","I needed HDMI to run a long cord to a plasma. If you run HDMI out, you need to use HDMI in. This is fine, but there is only one HDMI in. How do you hook your cable and DVD into one input?... Well I'll probably get a $200 HDMI switch. But for now I'm running my cable through my HDMI DVD player. When I get my Hi-def signal hooked up, I don't know if I want to route that through a DVD player that will do who knows what."
4,A workout that doesn't know what it wants.,"This workout is somewhat of a mixed bag. The first half hour is spent doing cardio work; it is not as intensive as Cardio Burn, but is a good ""medium"" cardio blend. The remaining 20 minutes are spent doing weight and lower body work, again, while appreciated, there is not enough time to really get a good workout. Thus, it doesn't appear that the Firm knew where they were going when they produced this workout. That being said, I use this tape when I have nominal time to spend exercising and want to get my heart rate up, or I run a couple of miles before hand and just do the cardio section as a supplement. Dale is a good instructor."
4,Yay for free TV!,"I live outside of Boston. I purchased this antennae to hook up to a little TV in a spare room. Assembled it, hooked it up, went to settings and did a channel search. I now have about 40 channels to choose from!The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because I had trouble getting the two ends of the loop into the little holes. They won't go in all the way. However, it doesn't really seem to effect the performance. Great deal for the price!"
2,Only picks up one station!,"I don't know if its because of my location, some sort of interference, or simply a defective product. All I know is this antenna didn't pick up any of my local stations save for one! The few that actually showed up on the screen had too weak a signal to show up properly. So basically just choppy distorted pictures and no sound. I messed with the antenna and moved it around a bit, but no change. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of just one, is because the one station that worked came in perfectly. So perhaps someone else may have better luck depending on where you live. I was not happy with it though and will be returning it."
2,This doesn't work for me,"I bought this and set it up near a window in my upstairs condo unit. I live in a city with a local television station nearby and should be able to pick up a few channels. I was not able to pick up anything at all.When I tried assembling the loop, you have to squeeze the metal ends and fit them into the slots, it seems like the slots are too small. I was looking for a hammer to force them in...Hammers and electronics are probably not the best combo, so I did my best with my fingers. The loop falls out and I have to put it back in again. I finally pushed on the metal ends with all of my might and they went in. It was surprisingly difficult to do! It still didn't get a signal. Went shopping for an amplified antenna..."
2,No strong signal--no Antenna,This antenna is of no use unless you live in an area where you can obtain a strong signal. Those who are living in areas where they can get good strong signals are the ones writing good reviews. I am able to pick up a few UHF channels and channel 3 has the strongest signal and it goes in and out. It is annoying when you are watching a show and the signal goes and come. No other local channels are available.
3,"Not Bad, Kinda Weird During Assembly","Purchased this for a second bedroom. Device works well, assembly process was kinda awkward considering it was incredibly difficult to insert the antennas all the way in on one side."
4,works well,"I got this product with a small TV and it does a pretty good job, I would recommend this product."
5,great product for its price,"I live in a suburb. With this little antenna, I can see all the major local new/international news channels. For the price, it is a great product!"
5,Works just as well as a roof top antenna,"For the digital stations in my location, this rabbit ear antenna received all of the same channels as a rooftop antenna that cost 4 times as much. The only difference was about 4-5 percentage points in the signal strength which didn't affect image quality at all.Try this first, you'll be pleasantly surprised if you have relatively strong signals in your area.I took it over to a friend who has a large flat screen and even folded down so it totally disappeared behind the set, it still pulled all of the local channels we get.I also have a digital tuner for my Mac and with this antenna I can watch digital tv on my laptop when I travel."
1,Was really hoping it would work...,The Antenna looked good and was priced for my budget and was brand name RCA. Unfotunatley it did not live up to my expectations. I could not locate one Digital channel on it from my TV. I had an old antenna unit (TREK brand) that had the antenna broken and it stil brought in more channels than this one. Sorry but have to give it a bad review.
4,Inexpensive antenna,"Good antenna for the price - whether it works for you depends on variables such as placement in the house in relation to location of TV transmitters in your marker, how far house is from TV transmitters. No way to say (or even know) whether or not it will work well for every given situation. Whenever installing a new antenna it is advisable to have your HDTV rescan for channels."
5,Works like a charm for NBC 6 Miami,"In Miami 33173, I got over 20 digit channels. The most important of them, NBC 6 Miami looks great!Easy to install: just connect it to my cable ready TV, put it aside in the table, set tuner mode of TV to Antenna, instead of Cable."
4,What a Bargain.,"I don't know the range of this antenna but after cutting the cord and checking tvfool.com, I determined I live within 9 miles of all major network TV stations in Jax,FL. It took maybe 5 minutes to set up on top of the entertainment center and a little longer to scan channels. Go to tvfool.com to find out station locations and signal strength in relation to your address. Anyway, like magic, HDTV. Some stations are more defined than others, 480p vs 1080p for example. Hey for the price and old school appeal, rabbit ears : ), this little passive receptor is a bargain.Since the last review, I've had signal troubles with some stations, especially PBS. I decided to take the antenna outside and connect it directly to the coaxial cable. I set the antenna on the adjacent electric meter box and now I get 23 stations most over 75% signal strength."
2,Review,The antenna has bad reception and has poor quality that material. I do not recommend buy this product. It is the tipical product of China
2,Basic,"I would not recommend this item unless you simply cant take spending another penny. This is as light weight as something can be made. It did draw in a few additional channels over no antenna at all but not even all the local channels were received; some intermittently and some not at all. Careful when moving the 'ears' they have very limited range and will break if you aren't careful not to try to overcome the resistance of this limited range; i broke one of the ears off quite easily. No great loss, it didnt change how it (didnt) work."
1,Only 1 HD channel,I bought this for only $10 after great reviews. Plugged it into my Panasonic HDTV and got only 1 clear HD signal. I returned it and purchased a TERK HDTVa. So far over 430 people have given the Terk HDTVa a mostly positive review. Will wait and see. Maybe the lack of power makes a different although some people insist it doesn't.
1,No quality control,"Bought this for my mom; she called me and said she couldn't assemble it, so I had to drive over just to figure out that the antenna holes were not threaded at the factory. There was a QC sticker on the bottom so somebody was being lazy at the factory.I spent more in gas just driving over; big waste of time. It's not even worth returning-- I'll have to mail it back, and don't feel confident that I'll get a working unit as a replacement anyway."
4,Weak cut cheap and easy,"Overall the design is simple and set-up was easy. The antennae was a little weak after setting up, but it gets more channels that my previous one. For an inexpensive fix to no channels this is a great buy, just make sure you are close to the channel/channels that you want to receive."
5,"Working Good, Real HD TV Antena !","Year ago when I purchased our first RCA Indoor Antenna to my office tv, one of 25"" HD. We were surprised to see the image quality, was much better than the cable image. And less than a quarter of the cost.All the people who come to my office and watch the tv always ask what kind of TvCable I have,and are always surprised when I answer is just an antenna.I recently bought another of the same RCA Indoor Antenna to my conference room. 60"" LED tv, and Works Fantastic Full HD imageDefinitely recommend this antenna if you need basic channels and a Real HD image"
4,Works fine for the price,"It is receiving around 14 channels in my home, but have to keep the antenna in various direction to get a clear reception."
5,gave me about 8 channels,"hubby wanted to take tv to work and they dont have cable, so we ordered this so he could get local channels. works good. he uses tv for presentations so this was added bonus that he could get some channels."
3,Didn't work where I live,"It's possible that my apartment is just in some sort of dead zone. I couldn't get it to pick up anything. I even had a flashback from the sixties and tried putting aluminium foil on the ends of.the antenna. (Silly me) Anyway, if you suspect that you live in an area that is too remote, or just in a black hole, like my apartment, you may want to explore other options, or maybe just a stronger antenna."
4,Works exactly as promised,"I'm using this antenna to supplement my satellite TV, to receive the additional local channels that aren't provided by them. So far, its worked exactly as promised. Hook-up was a incredibly easy. Note that it is a directional antenna, so you should have line-of-sight to get a decent signal."
2,Need multi-directional antenna with the HD convertor box,"You need to order a multi-directional antenna. Amazon shows you this antenna and states that they are purchased together. They do need to be used together, but you are better off spending your money on a multi-directional antenna at the beginning and not paying ofr this and shipping also."
4,Does its job,This RCA antenna does the job. It's small bit has bunny ears. Channels come in well enough. Easy to install.
1,not what expected,"I bought this in store after checking reviews here on Amazon, Many people seem to love it, but I was only able to get 2 or 3 channels, I believe I just need an amplified antenna to get the signal, this one is not."
5,Great Wtch,"This is a beautiful watch, goes from casual to evening effortlessly. This watch has worn well and looks just like it did when purchased. Great watch-Great price."
5,Love them!!,These earthy-looking canisters are beautiful! I have matching dinnerwear and accessories also.They look great on my brown quartz counter tops .An excellent purchase.
1,What the CRAP?,"I've seen and heard some horrible ideas for a tribute CD in my day, but this is absolutely the champ.This disk has some relatively unknown tracks from honest tributes of various artists/fans of Van Halen blended in with some sort of dance/techno club mixes. I have to tell you that if you are a true Van Halen fan, you do NOT want this album.There are some truly great hard rock tributes to VH's greatest hits, but they've been desecrated with that awful techno crap. Not one of the songs on this album has any redeeming quality to it."
2,this movie has BAD animation,ok so the movie wasnt all that bad plot wise (as far as hentai goes) but the animation was the most deplorable thing i have ever seen the people who were supposed to be normal looked more freakish than the demons half the time so if you dont have a problem with junky animation than by all means take a look but isnt animation really the whole point of anime in the first place?
3,Nice and big,This could easily handle a 2' whole fish. Stainless is nice but the hinge and lock are a little loose so the upper and lower baskets don't line up. I gave it 3 stars because at $29 I expected better quality.
3,Works alright but not as good as my old one,"My old antenna was a regular analog with amplifier. It finally broke, and I was looking for another antenna with amplifier to replace it. I saw this one and had my hopes up. Although it works great, I still cannot get a couple channels that I was able to get with my old one. I know the signal is weak in my TV room, but if my old non-digital antenna could pick up the signals, I expect this one to as well. Oh well.My solution will be to place the antenna in the next room and buy a 50' long coaxial cable to connect to it. I will update this review with my experience after that."
1,Just doesnt' work well where I live,I live about 50 miles from Chicago and this antennae brings in one channel no matter which way I turn it. Went back to old one which brings in 24 channels and keeps the picture in better. Gave this one to my grandaughter in Elkhart to try.
4,Good product,"Live in Los Angeles County here in Monterey Park,CA... I was able to get all the Channels clear with this antenna MINUS CHANNEL 2 which is CBS."
2,Roll the dice...,"I've never known of an amplified antenna that has worked really well so when I bought this one I wasn't expecting much. In fact, I was expecting very little. My goal was to drop my satellite service at $50 a month and make due with a powered antenna.So far, this antenna has confirmed my low expectations. I live on the outskirts of a major metropolitan area so this antenna should shine in this type of setting. Several channels are available at reduced strength. In the end, only one channel is even worth watching, and that one is of poor quality.You may have better results than I did but don't get the idea that this is the solution to all of your problems."
2,Good for the Amazon price,"I wanted one of these right away to watch some Sunday football, so I decided to go to a big box store and purchase one for $40. There are broadcasting antennas 15 miles NorthWest of me and antennas 25 miles SouthEast of me. The problem with this antenna is that it would only pick up the signals that it was pointing directly at, which causes an obvious problem with the antennas being different bearings from my house. I then returned it and bought an ""omnidirectional"" antenna for $70 and got only slightly better results. I ended up spending $80 on Amazon to get an outdoor antenna and a pre-amplifier. I now get all stations within 45 miles of me with a perfect signal. I would suggest going to a site like antenna point to see where the antennas are in your area."
3,"it;s ok work on hd tv,s",works ok for my tivo on my hd tv but you have to move it a lot be couses some chaneles doing come in tell you move the antanna a round alot you mite get one chanel but to get a nother you have to move it but it does the job...........
4,Whisper - Omen,"Good Santa?!? Josh Holloway as Max (a.k.a. Sawyer - LOST) he kid-napped an 8 year old kid that wanted his money. Devil Child (like Omen) Blake Woodruff as David. He wants everybody whispering in there own ears. Good movie, different story & different kid. But well never see part 2 on this movie. You will see it in the Alternate Ending if it would have been?.BONUS:- Alternate Ending (Time 3:54) Minutes- Deleted Scenes (Time 4:09) Minutes- Extended Scenes (Time 6:48) Minutes- The Making of Whisper (Time 8:45) Minutes* WIDESCREEN 1:85"
2,I Saw This on TV Last Night,"Wasn't too impressed by this movie. It was almost boring. A woman adopts a child who turns out to be the devil; the little boy gets kidnapped for a ransom, but when the kidnappers start dying off the head kidnapper decides the boy should be killed. Turns out, the kidnapper wanted the boy killed anyway.It's called ""Whisper"" because the devil in the little boy whispers to people, compelling them to do crazy things. The movie is quite boring up until it's climax. The climax was great, the storyline twist took me by complete suprise. I can usually figure a story out before it's climax but this twist kind of rocked me....and then it got boring again. In fact the ending was ridiculous!!I'm glad I saw this on tv. I wouldn't even rent this let alone buy. As someone else has said it's just a really good Omen knock-off; however,the Omen movie's are much better."
4,Shaded car,The shades fit my Honda Civic well & I could hold my steering wheel without burning my hands. My only problem with these shades is in getting them folded up again.There are directions but I found them hard to follow.
2,"not really ""jumbo""","Though it says it is a Jumbo size and it fits an Honda Odyssey. It is a bit smaller than advertised.It think it should be at least 1.5in bigger to fit OK, and about 2in bigger to fix well.It barely stays in place. It works on the Accord though, as the windshield is smaller."
2,I would not recommend,"After about a week of using the shades, one of the shades shrunk, I think because of the constant heat. The shade will not fold properly. I would not recommend these shades."
5,Jumbo Shades,I really like these Jumbo Shades they fill up my windshield very well...I have a Crown Victoria and it has a huge dashboard but these shades have no problem fitting in. This is a great product!!Rose
3,Run-on Sentences,"I read a number of Danielle Steele books a decade ago but then stopped and couldn't remember the reason. Her newest books are so badly written, I am surprised they are even published, but that was not the case back then. So I took the advise of a number of readers who loved one of her earlier books and read The Promise.Now I remember why I stopped reading her books. Every third or fourth sentence begins with AND or BUT.The plot was interesting but too simplistic and predictable. It had potential, but I didn't feel it lived up to it.And I agree with the reviewers who said it was unreasonable that he didn't try to find out where his beloved was buried, nor read any accounts of the accident."
5,Wonderful book--wonderful service,"The Promise by Danielle Steel is a wonderful book that I wanted my entire class to read. Nowhere else could I find enough copies of this book for my entire class. The price was right, but availability made the sale. Thanks, Amazon.com!!"
2,I guess if you like this type of very predictable novel...,"Gee! I haven't read a Danelle Steele novel since Family Album (I think that was in 1985). I loved that book...perhaps I have ""grown"" since then. This book is for you if you prefer Cool Whip to Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey!"
5,At her best,"This book is in the Top 10 most favorite Danielle Steel books, for me. I loved it, I loved everything about it. I enjoyed the characters, but what I loved most of all was the twist I didn't see coming. And a happy ending, who could ask for more? This is a classic D. Steel book, pick it up & read it!"
5,The Promise,The book - The Promise arrived on time and in good condition I chose this book as I always like Danielle Steele's books
1,"Why you should not buy the Kindle version of this book: ""[Unable to reproduce charts in text file]""","Buy the printed version of this book-not the Kindle version. Why? The author keeps referring you to missing graphs and charts (which are in the printed version only) to talk about numerous banking systems and global investment firms, etc. If you're on the Kindle version you're screwed: instead of seeing the chart or diagram Mullin is referring to you get a text message [Unable to reproduce charts in text file].This Kindle version is an incomplete version which is missing vital graphs and diagrams the author took pains to insert and refer the reader to. Very disappointing, amateurish job really."
4,Good clay play,"If you are looking for a clay product that makes very little mess, is wonderfully versatile, dries fairly quickly (overnight) and can be colored beautifully with watercolors or markers before it has even dried, then this product is it. I also find that the individual packs are the right size for small projects. Enough to do something with but not so much that they waste it. I have used it with kinders through sixth grade and it is great. I will be using it as a staple for clay work in my art classes in the future."
1,Region blocked!,"Region blocked. Why!!? I've lost dollars on this... A loyal fan who buys the season ASAP from the US gets stung by the sudden changing to region coded blu-rays. Bit unhappy Comedy Central - feel free to send me a Region 2 set, or my money back thanks!"
5,LIKE BRAND NEw,It even had the Broadway show in it but it expired but that's how how new it was. No scratches. Still in wrap. Great purchase. I trust them
4,Awesome Chairs,"Love these chairs; easy to assemble, however the only downfall is that the bolts do not stay tight and sometimes the chair becomes wobbly. Other than that wish I would of bought two more."
2,Okay but not great. Does not stay cold long.,"This was reasonably priced and from a name I knew but I was not impressed with the amount of cold it delivered. It only delivers heat or cold directly over the patella (knee cap) so if you need cold applied to the sides of the joint, this will not work for you. I found I had to remove the wrap after just a few minutes and flip the gel pack over as it was getting warm. Finally, I just held the cold pack to my knee as that was easier than removing the wrap from my leg, removing the gel pack from the wrap and reversing it and re-applying the wrap. The gel pack does not have sufficient mass to deliver cold for very long. I didn't try it with heat but the instructions specifically tell you not to microwave the gel pack directly. You must microwave it in a bowl of water or boil water, take it off the heat and then put the gel pack in it. This seems inconvenient."
2,To microwave you must BOIL WATER!! BE WARNED!!!,"Had I known, before ordering, that in order to use the microwave heat...1 - you must BOIL WATER in the microwave - you can NOT put the gel pack in the microwave directly2 - you place the gel pack INTO the heated water3 - you are advised to USE TONGS to remove the gel pack from the water4 - somehow, while handling a VERY hot gel pack you must now use your hands to stick the gel pack back into the pouch (without burning your hands? the gel pack is a VERY tight fit in the pouch)...I would NOT have purchased this dangerous product.People make mistakes with boiling water every day and acquire severe burns.This product is going back for a refund - I'll NEVER purchase a product that requires boiling water (unless it's coffee or tea - which is dangerous enough).Hope this helps.Range"
5,Excellent,This is an excellent book. There are thousands of words that you will see and read everyday. there're quizzes to test progress your english. There is an example for every word you learn inside for you to understand easily. I always carry this book everywhere I go. this book teach the most useful of the classical word building roots to help me continue expanding my vocabulary in the future.
3,OK Book,"This book is good for a undergraduate course, but nothing beyond.It is great for introducing databases, but the coverage on database design is pathetic. I would recommend the stanadard book by Ullman (2e) for this topic, for the more interested reader.The bibiography at the end of the book is great!"
2,It's Ok fun wih Ok graphics,"The game is not as many other titles out there. In my opinion the game was released and not finished 1st. Not much difference from part 1 and this is unacceptable due part one was a little better thn this one. Overall the current price is really worth buyin for. But $50,$20 dollars is a waste of $$ for this one."
4,Simple and Fun,This game is a great diversion and a hell of alot of fun for casual gamers. If you want more than a quick dose of action stick to RPG's.
2,NOT AS GOOD,"EASY AND CLEAR STEPS TO FOLLOW IN INSTALLATION, ALTHOUGH THE UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS REALLY BAD, FEELS VERY CHEAP...TACHLESS MODE WORKS GREAT, BUT FINDING SERVICE AND TECH SUPPORT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE...GOOD LUCK CONTACTING THEM!"
2,I guess I'll never know,if it will work. I have a GPS locater alarm in my Dodge Magnum and after reading the instructions I'd prefer not to install it. There are too many things that can happen in that I coulc get stuck without my vehicle.
3,Not bad but not great either,"As a longtime gamer of Warhammer Fantasy RolePlay (WFRP) since 1990, this book is a bit of a letdown, considering the fine material produced by GW in the past (Enemy Within, Death of the Reik, Power Behind the Throne).This book is the Hogshead version and consists of the first 2 parts (Fire in the Mountains & Blood in Darkness) of the Doomstones campaign (a 4 part adventure).While it has some interesting ideas and locales, this campaign is not much more than a refined 'hunt the magic bauble' so popular in Fantasy rolegaming. The players are on the trail of an ancient Dwarven artifact of 4 parts with incredible elemental powers. There is some investigation but this book is are really more appropriate for the combat-oriented player."
3,Mixed,"I have used this system before, so I know my towing safety will increase. I'm sure directional stability will be better. But, I did not receive installation instructions. Fortunately, one can get anything off the Internet nowadays, such as instructions from the manufacturer's website. Shipping was supposed to be five to nine business days; it was actually twelve. :-("
1,juliana at her best ?,".. I would hate to hear her lesser performances!Having been a Hatfield fan for as long as I can remember, I am severely dissapointed that this is what I get in a live cd(ep) after all these years.I've heard alot of bootlegs that put this lackluster effort to shame. sounds like she's been doing far too many white broken lines lately."
2,Good for only some.,I do have to say that I am glad I got this camera for free in a contest. I sell items on ebay and found out that picturs make all the sells.For my big items like cars and truck this is an ok camera. Sure the resloution is not so great but it gives people the idea. But for the items that I just don't feel like taking outside you have to have just the right amount of light. If you have too much or too little it turns out to be a bad picture. And don't plan on taking live action pix. unless you love blury shots.Even a slight move messes it up. But I say Buy at your own risk.
4,Surprisingly pleased!,"I purchased this camera for the sole purpose of sending pictures to family. I was pleasantly surprised at the sharpness of the pictures. Considering the price for the camera, it is well worth the money. (of course, if you expect this to take professional pictures, then buy a professional camera!)"
1,Stop -- put your card away! It's not worth it,"Not only is this camera awfull -- it's not even suitable for kids, unless as a parent you enjoy tearing your hair out while you try and fix serial port conflicts so that the little ones can enjoy a two inch square photo with less than 72 pixels per inch. I will probably never buy another polaroid again based on my experience with this one."
1,It's pants pants pants pants pants.,"I bought this as a cheapy fun camera. It's not fun it's depressing. The pictures wether indoors or outdoors are absolutely terrible. I took mine back and got my money back. Polaroid have always had a good name in my books, now they have sunk to the lowest of the low. I eventually bought a l'eprit mn100, same resolution, 500% clearer images, sensor that wont let you take pics in too low light. optimised for indoor lighting. 20 big or 80 small pics and can be used as a webcam. I am now truly happy."
4,LOTS OF FUN,"THIS CAMERA IS GOOD IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LOTS OF FUN. I LOVE PHOTOGRAPHY AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY A REAL GOOD DIGITAL CAMERA, BUT THIS CAMERA SERVES IT'S PURPOSE, IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR SCRAPBOOKING AND FOR THE OTHER THINGS I WANT AND NEED IT FOR. I'M SURE IT WILL SAVE ME MONEY ON DEVELOPING AND THERE'S NOTHING LOST IF YOUR PICTURES DON'T COME OUT RIGHT, YOU JUST DELETE THEM. I HAVE A VERY GOOD 35 MM CAMERA THAT I ALSO CARRY AROUND WITH ME AND THAT'S USED FOR ALOT OF THINGS ALSO. BUT REALLY, YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE OF THIS CAMERA AND IT'S GOT A GOOD NAME BEHIND IT."
3,You get what you pay for...,"For starters, the camera only works with BRIGHT lights. It doesn't include a flash. Also, the image quality is far from good, so it's just for putting on a web page, for instance, which is what I use it for. On the good side, it is cheap, easy to use, and the battery lasts a long time"
1,I should have known...,"I bought this camera on impulse after viewing the AOL Ad. At this price I should have known not to expect much, and really I didn't. Yet, even with low expectations, Poloroid was able to plunge me into making many self-deprecating statements and other fits of depression. The 320 x 240 resolution is too terrible no matter what lighting or other circumstances prevailed. I was so disappointed in my own stupidity, I didn't even have the common sense to send it back. Truly, this is a case where the advertisers have led the public astray, and I was one of the first. Poloroid should be ashamed of itself"
1,not worth the low price,"i received this camera as a gift and was so excited! i took pictures, loaded the software and i kept getting ""camera could not be found."" i exchanged the camera for another and got the same results. i finally got a total refund. i'm still looking for an affordable, good digital camera."
1,Another AOL customer burnt by this product,"Yes, I too was suckered by the AOL ad for their re-packaging of this product. A camera with no flash or flash connector is useless for indoor photos unless you live in a tanning salon.Also, the shutter speed is slower than a 60's Instamatic, making the camera useless for any action shots.This is a 99-cent plastic toy with a memory chip and a serial interface port glued on."
3,LOOK AT THE PRICE -- AND THE SPECS,"With all of the negative comments from the buyers, etc., one would expect less than spectaular results with this digital camera. Look first at the specifications -- no flash, minimal memory, etc.This is a good value for the novice, however, if you are expecting perfection and flawless digital photography, spend some more $$$$. You get what you pay for. All in all, it's a fair camera for the price -- just dont expect something for next to nothing. Great for kids, on-line sellers or just as a ""toy"". I purchased it (for less than the price noted) not expecting a miracle camera for the price and am pleased. Now that I know what to expect with the software, I'll save my pennies and purchase a better digital camera in the future.DO NOT EXPECT ALOT WHEN YOU DO NOT PAY ALOT...."
1,Not worth it even if it was free,"I cannot express how disappointed the performance of this camera is. I am an artist and I wanted something easy to take quick reference photos, and I thought this would be the ticket. The images are so weak, blurred and colorless. I won't buy another Polaroid camera ever. The software was also junk. Don't waste your time."
1,Where did my [money] go???,"I was robbed. This camera is HIDEOUS! Sure, I know it only cost ..., and the packaging LOOKS nice, but it should be a crime to dupe people into buying this. Let's see, where to begin? I know, how about: 1) The camera is deceptively good-looking. It's light, small and is ergonomically designed. Hmm... so far so good. 2) Although it's light, it feels CHEAP. 3) It IS cheap. Both in price and in quality. Not a good trade-off. 4) The software is lame. 5) (This is the important one) The program would not recognize the camera even though it was all hooked up correctly. Ok, at 320 x whatever, we know the quality is going to be awful, but not this bad. It's not even a good present for a kid if they can't use it. I can think of a lot better things I can do with [my money]! Buy the kids a Playstation game, you'll save ten bucks and they'll probably use it more. At least the game is guaranteed to WORK everytime. Happy Holidays...you've been warned."
4,Great digital camera for beginners,"I've owned my Polaroid 320 for about 6 months now and enjoyed it. I used it mainly for my online auctions. Most of the pictures were fair-good but after figuring out where to take the pictures(because of no flash) and how to use the software my pictures got somewhat better.It's a great camera to buy but I would advise learning about the software and experimenting with the camera before ""officially"" using it. Unfortunately because this camera is not USB ""compliant"" I am unable to use it with my new computer."
3,Blast from the past,"This book bears some historical interest, because it was written about the perceived far right movement as that movement was emerging. Lacking historical perspective, Dudman covers familiar names such as Senator Strom Thurmond, Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckley, Jr. He also covers more obscure people, such as John Birch Society founder Robert Welch, General Edwin A. Walker, McMarthy backer Gerald Smith, and American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell.There is also some discussion about the movement in general, and its relationship with intellectualism, fanaticism, and J. Edgar Hoover."
1,Namco + RPG = A Flop,Upon reading the back of this case I thaught this game would be great. I alos was happy to find Namco doing a game that isn;t fighting or Racing. This game mixes elements from a lot of other rpg games I have played and most of the time when there is a lot of diffrent systems in one RPG game it is great. Too Bad this wasn't the case with Dragon Valor... I guess im stuck with it until Arc The Lad comes out for Psone if it isn't delayed again. I would also like to make one last note. Namco stick to Fighting and Racing.
3,Cute but loud,"I thought i would get this for my daughter because it uses regular ice cubes and you dont have to freeze the normal containers. Boy is this thing loud, and if your ice cubes are too big you have to try and shake this thing to get them going in the track. I used just regular ice trays too. For people that like Mickey Mouse i am sure they would like it. I will try and find something smaller that just shaves some ice.."
2,EXPIRED PILLS,"BE AWARE OF EXPIRED PILLS.THERE ARE SELLERS SELLS EXPIRED DIET PILLS. It happened to me twice from different sellers. Expiration date was not in the comments section from neither sellers and they send me a product that it's not useful, I had to put them in the trash, because sellers refuse to refund my money. Please be careful ask seller for expiration dates before you end up wasting your money."
5,Gameshark CDX for the Sega Dreamcast,"I was familiar with the Gameshark having had one when I had a Nintendo 64, so I was just itching for Interact to put out a Gameshark for the Dreamcast, and they finally did! It's great! I'm now able to RULE over my favorite Dreamcast game, ""Resident Evil: Code Veronica"" with unlimited ammo and invincibility! The Gameshark is easy to use and I've heard it makes the Dreamcast compatible to play import games too. For all the pre-loaded cheat codes included, and the ability for you to always enter new codes, the Gameshark is invaluable to have for your Dreamcast! Buy one today, you'll be glad you did!"
5,"Replete with study, preparation, and firsthand memories","Sticks & Wires & Cloth by Anne Hopkins is the personal story of a woman who pursued her dream to fly in a 1929-design biplane. Replete with study, preparation, and firsthand memories of the wind in one's face and one braves the sky, Sticks & Wires & Cloth is an invigorating and involving testimony recommended for aviation buffs and armchair travelers, offering the most vivid impressions of biplane flying experience to be had without actually climbing into one and taking off. Sticks & Wires & Cloth is a unique and welcome addition to any personal or community library Aviation Studies collection."
5,Great,Love this product...cake comes up even brown....easy to get it out from the pan...very flexible and doesn't required a lot space to storage....glad to have it makes it really easy for baking
2,not for me,I was disappointed when the cake stuck to the pan. I suppose I should have sprayed the pan first but I thought this type of pan eliminated that step.It is also so big that the cake came out waay smaller than usual. I would have taken 1/2 again as much batter to make it to size. A waste of money for me..
1,Will It Only Record The Program You're Watching?,"The only question I have is never answered clearly. Will this unit record one program while you're watching something else on the tv, or is it going to record the same thing that's on the screen? Only my old VCRs, which have all died except for one (and it's about to), would do this. Everything I've looked at in the past few years, even with its own tuner, records whatever is on the tv screen. That makes the unit totally useless to me, as I'm one of four people in the house and we all watch different programs. It's beyond frustrating when I think I've taped something, only to find I actually have an hour of someone's channel surfing! And I can't just buy one machine after another, only to find they all do the same thing (I already have two that I can't use)."
3,QUESTION PLEASE ANSEWER,"I have a question about the VCR function. Can you record a show on one channel and watch TV on another???? Example. I am recording on channel 3 and can still change the channel on my TV to any one I want. This was done all the time on VCR's. YOu would set the VCR to record but then hit the TV/VCR button and then you were free to change the channel on the TV to whatever you wanted , and it was still recording your program."
4,ok,"My 13-year old thinks this book is funny. I, having grown up on Asterix & Obelix, think it's entertaining but not worth reading a second time. It doesn't hold a candle to the humor and storylines of Asterix."
5,Family Therapy,This is a textbook that can be read with ease and has examples to illustrate the concepts try spot on.
4,True to Life,"I found this book very informative, true to life, down to earth, funny, heart warming and inspirational. Once I picked it up I could not put it down."
4,An honest revelation,"Having read almost all of Karen Armstong's profoundly meaningfull studies I wondered how it all came about. This book provides a very honest insight into the sufferings of a young woman and the origin of her enduring search for the truth about so-called ""revealed"" religions"
2,OK read,"I much prefer Karen Armstrong's more academic reads such as A History of God for their informative value. Although this novel gave some insight into her character and personality, I was expecting more depth. For that reason, I was a bit disappointed."
3,A view from inside the program,"As this is now available in inexpensive paperback, I have upped my rating and changed the title. I admit to being annoyed reading his sophomoric account, but I underestimated how little many people knew about the program and their enthusiasm. Never good to trash an astronaut, even Mullane, but I still feel it would be better to find something written by the fellow (but civilian) astronauts that he puts down, such as Ride, Hawley and Hoffman. These folks knew what was up and appreciated the experience. My critics inexplicably think this is PC - what is really PC is wanting everybody to agree with you. Read the book, there are nuggets to be mined."
3,It was okay,"The principles don't apply to every race-and be prepared to have a large bankroll, you'll need it. I was generally disappointed."
1,one born every minute,"Mr Pizzolla is a clever fellow. It is my guess that he is making more money from selling his ""methodologies"" than from his betting action. Ask yourself, if someone really has a successful approach, why would he share it? Surely, someone as intelligent as Pizzolla would have learned from the storied experience of Andrew Beyer (who brought down the odds on the horses he would bet by publishing his method).So, either Pizzolla is more interested in talking (writing) about what to do than doing it. Or flat out can not make a living with his own insights. I have read the online reviews and come to the conclusion that those raving about being winners are mistaking luck for skill.Buyer beware."
5,Handicapping Genius,"This book is, simply put, the greatest book on handicapping ever written. It follows closely the principles of William Scott. Who I thought the greatest teacher, until I read this book. It is not an automatic formula. I have been using this system for about four years. I still have not mastered it. It is like learning chess; you get some of it sometimes, and sometimes you don't. However; the insight you get into the game is phenomenal.A friend of mine who used to be a far superior handicapper, was impressed by the handicapping insight I displayed shortly after reading this book. He wanted to know what I was studying. I told him. After he saw me picking longshot after longshot, he bought the book. We handicap together now. The power fraction led us to War Emblem (who we did not bet- too unsure of the system- to Funny Cide...."
3,Good Introduction to Pace Handicapping,"This is a decent general introduction to a system that is really nothing more than a variant of Pace Handicapping. It is a fun read, although sometimes the author seems a bit enamored with his sense of humor referring, for example, to horses as ""pigs.""If you really want a complete understanding of Pace Handicapping, you will need to plow through Brohamer's book."
4,worthwhile buy,"If you are a serious horseplayer and student of pace handicapping, this book is a must read. Pizzolla's Form Cycle Window to the PP charts is particularly insightful and potentially lucrative. You will find more juicy-priced horses to use underneath in exotic bets than you could dream of. More importantly, you will leave the windows feeling more confident about your plays than prior to reading this book. Incorporating Pizzolla's methods in your current handicapping methods is a must. By far the best book I've read on handicapping."
4,Most popular pan in our kitchen,Perfect for quickly cooking breakfast eggs. Clean-up is easily done as eggs just don't stick. Run under warm water with a touch of detergent and a soft brush to clean up for he next day.
4,Solid foundation for Bash/Linux Scripting,"This book, unlike some of the other Bash books on the market, has very accessible and complete examples. It goes beyond simple explanations, but manages to start with the most basic concepts. My only complaint is that it is very text-heavy. Anyone who used Bash on a regular basis, even if they think they are advanced, will find something useful in this book - but if you are new to Bash, the text might be a little too dense. Easier to read than the man pages, and worth the effort, but it will take effort.Overall, one of the best current books on the subject."
5,"To me, this is an excellent resource","I have found the book to be very helpful, well organized, and have just the right amount and choice of information. It was easy to follow, and using it as a reference I've built many complex shell scripts."
2,"Oh well, the thought was nice","i'm going to guess these people make console games or wish they didThis game is 3rd person, a *really* bad choice for this game. The camera is often stuck behind thingsThis game is hard. That's OK, but you can't save a game, and you *will* die thanks to some surprises, so expect to get bored playing the same thing over and overThere are only 11 maps i think, and most are _very_ small. The game is short, although they stretch out the game play by preventing you from saving the gameIt's a minor complaint, but why don't any of these Asian gangsters recognize a tall, white, albino, bald guy with a UPC code on his head? Is his disguise of a shirt and pants really that good?There are numerous bugs. Or maybe they aren't bugs, just bad design choices. For example, you can't walk through a guarded gate unless you first touch someone who has walked through it - bizareThis could have been a really good game, but it isn't."
2,Not what I Expected,"Looking at the box of this game i expected it to be really cool, and from reading all the reviews that say it was good, but when i bought it, it was a very large dissapointment. After the first few missions the game becomes so frustrating, that you will want to break your computer. The controls are very messed up, and the camera fews always get stuck on walls so you can not see anything. This game is frustrating because 90% of the game is trial and error. If you go the wrong way you become ..., because most of the missions are timed ... so you lose the mission. I got to admit the visuals in this game are very eye pleasing, but it doesn't not make this game worth the ... that it is. HC47 also had tons of glitches and bugs in its system which eventually ... the ... out of you. Well my opinion is not to buy this game, but u can try it for yourself, and see what you think"
4,Handy,I am so happy my wife ordered this for me. The router base is one of my most used item for my dremel. I use it for all of the Boy Scout projects and crafts for my wife also for my daughters Girl Scouting project.
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","Well, I just loved this thing for about a year, then the screw to hold the depth constant, the handle screw, not the depth screw completely failed. Now I can only use it as a plunge router. It will not hold for a set depth anymore. That makes for a very limited tool. I have read the reviews for the alternate ""knockoff"" version, and am not impressed, so I'll guess I'll have to bite the bullet and buy another one like this. I would gladly pay double for a unit that is built better, because I end up buying 2 instead of having one good one. That one will eventually fail too."
2,A little bit of metal wouldn't hurt?,"Fine tool for ""small delicate projects"" mainly because the wing nuts used to tighten the guide bar (for straight and circular routing) are made of plastic with a metal screw. It is impossible to tighten them enough to keep the tool working straight. On a solid wood project the tool jumped around because of the way it loosely sits in the plastic base. Because of the vibration the screws that are meant to retain the depth of cut unscrew them selves, changing your settings unless you really lock them in place. Yes; for small delicate projects, but be ready for a lot of troubleshooting and make sure you practice on some scrap so you totally know what you are getting yourself into :)"
1,Missing crucial specification,"This is a fine component, but it is impossible to tell from Kerk Motion's description if it will fit one of its own leadscrews.I ordered two of these with what appeared to be the correct leadscrew:Kerk Motion Stainless Steel Lead Screw Shaft 1"" Lead, 3/8"" Screw Shaft Diameter x 24"" LongHowever, despite being the same diameter, the leadscrew has five starts and the nut has nine. Obviously, there are other 3/8"" components listed on Amazon, but they all lack sufficient information to pair the leadscrew with the correct nut. So unless you would like to order one of each, try McMaster or some better-documented site. If you DO decide to order one of each, please leave a review so the rest of us can know which parts will work together!"
5,arc of justice,excellent book must read for anyone interested in racial problems that still exist whether you live in detroit or any other large city we have not gone far enough to solve the problem and we will never be able to change some people
1,Not Widescreen,"I just received this DVD; it is NOT widescreen. Why produce a new DVD of a film in the old ""pan-an-scan""? And at $18.!! Amazon does its customers a disservice when it does not specifiy that the film is only available in a modified format. Now I have to go to the trouble of returning it."
4,I never knew there were so many coins...,"If you have world coins, this book is for you. There are coins from pretty much every country. Even countries I had never heard of. The book tells you the composition of each coin and the mintage. It also gives you a prices. For the most part the price seems to be a little high, but you get the general idea of the price.I used the book to find out how much some Australian coins were worth. The only bad thing about the book is it can be a pain finding the coins within the country. It could be organized a little better. However, buy this book if you have world coins and you want to find out how much they are worth. Just have lots of storage because the book is huge!!!"

1,useless,"I really don't understand why there are so many positive ratings on this book. It is useless to me. Full of high level superficial suggestions, lack of knowledgeable insights. I don't think I need someone to tell me that it is important to research the market, and to know your competitors. A lot of places in the book says ""talk to your account for this and that..."", or ""go to www.somewebsite.com..."". If I have to refer to somebody else or go somewhere else for any in-depth topic, what do I buy this book for???"
3,A fairly good sampling of a decade in Annie's career,"What a life Annie had-and with her dog Sandy,she went through adventure after adventure-sometimes, but not always,with the help of her gaurdian, ""Daddy,""Warbucks.These were the truly topical years in Annie's career that she was known for.Learn how she handles New deal advocates,see her as she begins the Junior Commandoes during the war(which led to many actual groups of children forming clubs to aid the war),and learn how she survived many turmoils and near-tragedies during the times when America was in it's tragic years."
5,La Stupenda Bartoli,"As a performing operatic tenor, I well know the difficulties of maintaing line and expressing subtle nuance associated with this period of music, but Cecilia does a fantastic job on both accounts! What purity of tone and clarity of thought she presents. For those students of voice, this is a recording which can properly introduce, in a simple and unadorned way, the basics of line, phrase, breath, and musicality; a fantastic addition to one's musical library."
4,An excellent buy for anyone studying voice!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this album, specifically because Ms. Bartoli performs songs familiar to anyone who has studied voice. Her renditions of the classic pieces many take for granted are breath taking. Although Ms. Bartoli is admittedly dark in her lower register, I did not consider this a negative quality in this collection, particularily because every phrase she sings (even those that are repeated as in Gia Il Sole Dal Gange) is unique and endearing. I'd certainly recommend this cd to sopranos!"
2,Misleading pictures sometimes,"The picture showed the air filtering type bag, which I wanted, but these are just the plane bags. I will check for stores in my area instead, next time."
3,Can't see temperature numbers,"I purchased this thermometer because Cardinals have a special place in my heart, and the picture is very classic, very pretty. But functional as a thermometer, it is not, as the numbers are black and difficult to see, especially at any slight distance."
4,Silly,"My kitten enjoys beating up and bunny kicking this catnip banana toy. The catnip smells really strong and seems to be high quality. I think my kitten is too young to be affected by the psychedelic qualities of catnip yet so maybe he'll grow into this toy even more. I am going to get the other toys from this brand because they seem pretty durable, fun and cute and what matters most is cats like them."
3,It's Okay,I think its because I left it out. It seems to be more popular when I put it up and bring it out occasionally.
3,It's here.....,"the toy that we thought would make our kitten's day. So it was presented to her with great anticipation....and she just turned and walked away. We've attempted playing fetch with it. Dragging it in front of her. Nothing helped. However, ugly black mouse that came as a part of a cheap pk of toys from walmart she carries around in her mouth and plays for hours. You just never know."
3,My cat sniffed and...........,"My cat sniffed, starred at it and walked away. My cat don't play with this at all and I'm so surprised that he don't want to play with it since he is still a hyper kitty. Maybe he will warm up to it but for right now he is just starring and sniffing he don't even put his paws on it."
5,Great cat toy,My older cat loves this. It's very well made. She grabs and kicks it and lays by it all the time. The catnip is very strong and she really likes that. I would buy this one again.
3,A good cat toy,Our Siamese cat liked it right out of the package and tore a hole in it. It has lots of back claw marks and teeth marks from him playing with it and we found some catnip all over certain areas of the house. It was short lived though. He will start playing with it for about 5 minutes and then he get's bored. He would rather play with his little mice instead. It does have a strong catnip smell and is perfect for some back claw kicking action. Not a bad toy.
4,Great Book for Strength Athletes,"Steve Justa is not only a great lifter, but his aptly named book shows he can teach you exactly what he has done to become so strong. This book surprised me in it's realistic style, which makes you feel as if Steve is sitting with you at his kitchen table, telling you his secrets. Not only does this book show what he has done to become strong, but it outlines many different excercises and lifting routines to explore news areas of strength in your own lifting. If you are looking for a book that can give you new, creative ways to effectively increase you overall strength levels, you need to add this book to your collection."
4,here's wat i think......,i love this song......and i put 4 stars only bcuz i think that other people will rate it this much...but i think its 5+ starz...hehe if thats possible!! but this track is amazing.....it'll have u dancin in a second.....
4,Very good unit,"I have owned this radio for several years now. I only have one complaint. After a couple of years the faceplate gear/clutch came apart and it has been nearly impossible to find a replacement. This gear/clutch is the link to the gear train from the driving worm gear that brings the faceplate up and down. On the upside the faceplate is spring loaded for the up position so if it does blow this gear you can still manually work it. I was able to find a different model with the same display system and was able to get the gear/clutch out of that one. With the exception of this one problem I have had no complaints. The head unit has been very good to me. I love having a 7 band equalizer and high and low pass filters built into the radio as well as independent sub woofer control. The only thing keeping this radio from a 5 star is the trouble hunting down a replacement gear/clutch, though other replacement parts are readily available for those that are savvy enough to repair their own devices."
3,"So cool, and so short-lived","When I ordered this necklace it was just as interesting as I imagined it would be, the shape and function of it recalling all kinds of medieval fantasies...but it didn't stand up to my repeated toying with the clasp and ultimately after only a few months the back of it fell off. Really awesome while it lasted."
4,"Looks nice, works well","I'm pleased with this card case. I use it for my business cards, and it works well. The modernistic look and comfortable feel were just what I was looking for to go with my business image. It is good value for the money, despite the shipping charge being almost as much as the price of the item itself. My only complaint is that it is a little on the large side. It takes up almost as much space in my pocket as my wallet."
2,wrong dictionary,"This dictionary is not pocket size, unlike the universal version.This dictionary was not designed for native English speakers, unlike the universal version.This information could only be found if one looked at the dictionary."
5,super loud,"I love this whistle - have been using it to train extreme long distance recalls for my dog. He's responding well to it. I like it so much, I actually lost my first one, and bought another one."
3,It Works,My treadmill arrived before my treadmill mat. The mat took away the worry of scratching my hardwood floor. The mat grips the floor very well and provides good cushioning for the treadmill. I notice minor noise reduction after I added the mat.
4,Good but battery life limited,"CON: I don't use this every day, and when I do, I must charge it in advance.PRO: The attachments are great- haven't found any hairs I can't cut to any desired length."
4,Gran Maquina de Corte,"Es un buen producto por su reconocida marca Conair y muy util gracias a todos los accesorios incluidos, la bateria dura el tiempo suficiente. Ideal para tratar el vello del rostro."
5,WONDERFUL,"WONDERFUL!!! My husband absolutly loves his trimmers. He likes the attachments that came with it, however, I have to agree with some of the other reviews about this item. The storage tray to keep all the attachments together, is just too small. We put them in a small container instead. One thing about the trimmers is that they work real well on the fine hairs. We have a 14 month old who got a new hair cut from his 4 year old brother and we used the trimmers to fix the ""happy hair"" my son had. They worked great!!! We also used them to give the 4 year old a new look. Like I said, they worked great!!"
2,I should of researched!,"I didn't buy mine from Amazon. I'm actually reading reviews to buy a good beard trimmer to repalce this one.First of all, it speeds up and slows down by itself. It doesn't cut very well. It takes me 20 minutes to trim my beard with this.I was impressed by the number of attachments, but after six months I only use one. I agree with poster who said her husband had trouble putting all the attachments into the base. Also, the light base often tips and dumps them all over when I pull the trimmer out. Poorly designed."
1,"works fine,....but the rechargeable battery is horrible.","the trimmer worked fine,...but the battery never held a charge well - and it died completely in less than 1 year of moderate use. once the battery's dead, the trimmer is trash.a product like this should last more than one year - period."
1,Not what I asked for,"I paid for Omniform 5.0, in the front page and in the CD says 5.0, but when you download in the computer it says 5.5 and it is completely different to the one I need. The thing is that if you don't pay and open the paper, you don't know that it is different. Sorry, I think that it is not Amazon fault, but the one that did the handling for the manufacturer. Maybe, if you ask them to open up for you before buying it, maybe they realize that it is a different product."
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed with the product, as it doesn't do the job I intended to use it for, and now that it has been opened, I can't return the product. I should have probably gotten OmniForm first.."
1,very dry meat,"I was very excited to receive this. However, after I opened one box, I noticed that the cans have some rust on the edges. I could not find the expiration date. After I opened the can and tried the contents, I got really disappointed. The seafood is way overcoooked and very dry even though it was in tons of oil. It was also extremely sour. Definitely not marinara."
1,It really activates your cat,"into throwing up that is. The first time I tried it, the cat threw up about three hours later. This is a healthy cat that rarely throws up. The cat has also eaten salmon before, so there should be no underlying problem with that.The vomit has a pronounced fishy smell, I just hope it comes out of the carpet."
5,Great comedy for people with imagination,"This is a great movie, kind and funny. It shows life in Russia and a little bit in France. Europeans love it, and it is very funny from a point of view of an American as well."
5,Science Fiction History At Its Best,"Science Fiction has never been given its due as a ""real"" branch of literature. This book places this genre in the general literature context and has traced its development in a clear, succint way. This should be read by anyone who has an interest in the genre its history, development, etc. the book links science fiction leterature with TV, film, music,etc. It also examines science fiction as a lens to determine meaing in the the world. Excellent."
5,The Best British Band of the 90's,"This collection doesn't even begin to cover the fantastic but short music career of this great, great, superb band, but it's a start. With excellent lyrics, even better music and the haunting vocals of frontman Richard Ashcroft this was a band I truly thought was built to last. Pity it didn't. ""Creative difference"" cut their legacy short but oh, what splendid music they left behind. ""Lucky Man"" still brings tears to my eyes because it's such a beautiful song. If you don't know The Verve you definitely heard their epic song ""Bitter Sweet Synphony"" and that whole Rolling Stone controversy. The Stones should be lucky to have this band sample them. It coulda been P. Diddy..."
4,Cabotine de Gres,"I loved this when I first smelled it in an insert in a women's mag. I finally bought a bottle,and to me it still smells great. Can be strong, so you don't need too much. Great perfume, it you want something very different."
5,A MUST HAVE~,"I've loved Angelina since the first day I heard her song ""Release Me"" on the radio. This is the second time I've bought this C.D. It's killa~if you love freestyle and everything that comes along with it, Angelina is the girl."
3,Tool nice - case not,I bought this for my husband as a gift. He has several projects to do in our winter home where he plans to use this. He hasn't used it yet but he has been satisfied with the previous dremel tools he has had. The case needs improvement. There are several small pieces that come with the tool and he has bought more. The case does not provide a good way to store these. In fact it has a false bottom with holes in it that allow the small pieces to drop into the holes. It is extremely difficult or maybe impossible to retrieve anything that drops into the space between the false bottom and the outside case. My husband puchased another set of accessories that came in a nice case that will hold all the small pieces.
2,great tool but has faulty variable speed switch,If it were not for the problems it has with the variable speed switch this would be a wonderful tool for small jobs. I was very happy with it for about two years of infrequent use. I didn't use it all that often but when I did it was invaluable. But then the speed switch stop varying the speed. It would either be off or at maximum speed. After doing a little research I found out that this is not an uncommon problem with this model. If it were not for this I would be giving it 5 stars. Since most jobs need a slower speed it has become rather useless to me now.
2,Extremely disappointing!!!,I have NiCad batteries that outlast these Lithium Ion batteries & NiCad batteries are the most primitive of rechargeable batteries. Also the button that is supposed to lock the spindle so that the collet can be tightened and untightened became useless in a very short time. It bogs down at the slightest resistance making it very difficult to get the job done. I'm buying a Black & Decker instead.
2,Must have got a lemon...,"Bought this for my hubby for Christmas 2006. His mistake is that he isn't take it out of the box to use it until that following summer. When he finally did, it never held a charge at all so it never worked not 1 day. It was too late to return so it was basically a waste of $100+. Lesson learned....."
1,battery lasted one recharge,I have used the Dremel for one grinding job( very light duty ) and recharged the battery only to find it wont charge.Maybe the charger maybe the battery.Overall pathetic.
1,Not impressed,"I am not impressed in the least with the 8000-01 model. I have been using dremel's for a number of years now and this is the first one I have purchased.I am a service tech and do alot of traveling for repairs. I work on a lift or high on a ladder so extension cords are troublesome and possibly dangerous. Most of the places I go have limited outlet availability so the cordless model seemed perfect for me. I have used it less than 2 months and the speed guage is already malfunctioning, the battery lasts about 30 mins at best and it takes 3 hours to charge. I was going to purchase a spare battery but the average price I could find is $45 compared to $70 I paid for the tool. Not very cost effective in my book."
5,Better than plug in,"This dremel is awesome. No more messy wires or needing to be near a plug in. Has just as much power and a charge last for quite some time, with a recharge time almost nothing. I use it for hobby uses and it it perfect. One complaint i would have is the dremels on off switch is also the speed control and i hit it once when i sat it down and it turned on. not really a problem just thought I would add that."
4,NICE!,"So far I'm liking it. For what I'm doing it seems to provide the appropriate power, Don't know if I don't prefer one with a cord. I can see that getting the addition set of bits will be a help. But a good item."
4,Nice but should come with a spare,"Light and powerful with fairly good run-time, but like all rechargeables including lithium-ions, it runs out of juice. However, unlike most rechargeables, it does not come with a spare battery. So you have to wait a half hour to an hour for it to recharge. A spare battery I'm starting to find out runs a good $40 to $60; no wonder it was not included."
2,Dremel Quality?????,"I have had Dremel tools for years. Still have a 115 volt drill that has worked fine for years.I purchased the Dremel 8000-01 because I could see it as a very useful tool. Well, the first one I had changed speeds on its own. I would set the speed I wanted, then without warning the speed would slow down or speed up, depending on the tools mood (I guess). Sometimes it did work just fine. So I returned the unit and received a replacement.The second unit is really, really loud (a nasty high pitched whine) and it vibrates really bad a low speeds.Needless to say it's going to be returned.It's sad the Dremel quality control as fallen to this level. Because if the tool functioned properly I would be quite happy with it.Should I try a third one?"
2,Dremel tool dies in 5 months!,"I've owned several Dremel grinding tools in the past. In May 2009 I purchased this one. Although the battery is larger, it seems less powerful than my old model. As of October 2009, only 5 months later, the battery is completely dead and the charger no longer works to recharge it. It is unclear whether the charger or the battery is defective, but something is definitely not right. I am disappointed with the performance of this model and have contacted Dremel asking about a replacement. No word as to what they'll do yet.Dremel 8000-03 10.8-Volt Lithium Ion Cordless Rotary Tool"
4,Handy Man,Works great lasts a long time on the 10v battery. Maybe a little sensative to keeping speed/shutdown feature. But on the whole NICE!
3,Good tool; speed control is broken.,"This is a great cordless tool. It has payed for itself quickly on the various jobs where I used it. I'm glad that it payed for itself so soon because the speed control broke after very little usage. It seems a little cheaply made, but I would buy another because it is so useful for the general handyman."
3,It's OK,"On the plus side the battery lasts a long time. On the negative, it automatically shuts off under load and requires restart. I am switching back to a plug in model...."
3,Nice starter kit,"Nice Dremel starter kit, but the case is worthless. What a waste of plastic. It is hollow and nothing stays put when you open it."
5,great compilation,"fantastic compilation cd of the best tracks billy thorpe and the aztecs released back in the 60s/early 70s, in the beginning i felt the aztecs where australias answer to the london merseybeat scene with fantastic covers of poison ivy etc etc, next to the easybeats billy thorpe and the aztecs may have been the biggest aussie band going around 1966, though i would still like more materiel that the aztecs recorded in the 60s this is the better of the two compilations that are available right now, im hoping autralias own AZTEC LABEL wich has been releasing a lot of billy thorpes solo stuff from the 70s the past 5 years or so digs further back and gives us some more 60s gems, at some point i hope they will but for now this is the best product available of billy thorpes 60s output if you like liverpool/london 1964/65 merseybeat you should love this then. enjoy i know i did as soon as i got this cd in the post."
4,Great for someone who isn't scared to use a different firmware,"I have used several Asus routers. Out of the box these stink, but if you install the tomato firmware, this turns into a powerhouse router. Yes it does add some complexity, but it is well worth it. If you have any problems you are usually able to reflash it with the clear settings firmware and start over. This is one of the few routers that works with tomato and has 32mb of flash storage (for the firmware).One hitch, the tomato firmware currently doesn't support USB. There are other firmware options if you must have usb suppot.I didn't give it a 5 star, because it does require some time and patience to initially set up the tomato firmware."
1,Eighth Grade and Lower,"This paperback was a major disappointment. I already have excellent hardback dictionaries, including the Collegiate version. But this version doesn't come close the Collegiate, and may not even be resourceful for eighth graders. The book struck out on the first of three inquiries. A closer look revealed polysyllabic words are few, and less common words are rare. If you're looking for a lightweight paperback to supplement your other resources, this dictionary is NOT it."
5,Absolutely spell-binding.,"As a fan of Ludlum, Clancy, Grisham, Hillerman, and Sandford, I thought I'd try one of Cussler's books and was sorry I did. I couldn't put it down until I was finished. My roommate picked it up and found it equally as difficult to put aside. I realize that some of this is imagination, some based on fact, and some very real, but that's why I read--to experience more of the world than the one I live in. Its a great thriller and grabs your attention from page 1. I highly recommend it and am looking forward to reading all of Cussler's other books."
1,"Shockingly Poor, Cussler has lost it.","I must say that this is the most ridiculous of the Pitt novels I have read. The whole plot is just too ridiculous (sound waves from mines converging and killing everything in a zone thousands of miles away, reflected with an old telescope) !.Also the discriptions of the women, I can only assume that Clive has never met any Australians. For me Mr Cussler has not written a decent book in ages. For a good read try some of his earlier books like :Mayday (The Meditereanean Caper), Iceberg or Pacific Vortex.I will not be buying any new Cussler books as this is the 3rd 'ok I'll give him another chance',Nigel"
4,Shockingly good,"In an age when we sometimes feel there are no realheroes left, it is fun to read about a man who has no faults- a man who is courageous, intelligent, skilled, and a truegentleman. We know he is too good to be true, of course, butit is still fun to read about him. That is the kind ofcharacter Clive Cussler has created in Dirk Pitt, the heroof 13 different books!In this adventure, Shock Wave, Pitt comes across avillain who is an evil as Pitt is good, a billionaire.Shock Wave, like the other Dirk Pitt novels, is goodold-fashioned escape reading. Cussler's characters are allpretty predictable and one-sided, and there are no deepmeanings to explore. But the plots are quite well done, andthe writing, though a bit bombastic, is fun to read. If youhave read others in the series, you will certainly enjoythis one. And if this is your first, there are plenty ofother titles in the series."
3,OF COURSE..,"Of course people who buy books featuring always the same character, and who will always win the end, loved the book, and will always give Cussler books great reviews. But this one is not his best, although a plesant read."
4,'Couldn't put it down action packed exiting fun!!',To keep it short...This book is every bit as good as Clive's earlier novels and Dirk Pitt continues to amaze readers with his uncanny ability to avoid death. Clive puts you on the edge of your seat and sends you for the ride of your life. -Excellent
2,Dirk Pitt almost dies!!! But doesn't!!!,"Typical Dirk Pitt/Clive Cussler novel. Dirk and Al Giordinojump from one impossible situation to another...outrunninghelicopters on jetski's, staying alive for over two weeks at sea on a dinghy, etc. Thouroughly entertaining and a read. I don't know if anyone can tell a tale like Cussler...even if it is pretty far-fetched."
2,Boring,"The book starts off with a terrific survival tale of an English ship full of Australian bound captives, suddenly discovering that they are way off course due to a terrible storm. What follows is a 70 page tale of death, despair, deceit, and survival.After that, the book is ruined by the prototypical Dirk Pitt saga. There's some monstrous, megalomaniac with some diabolical scheme. However, the nauseating Dirk Pitt comes to the rescue (surprise, surprise), and saves the day using ludicrous and ridiculous tactics.And of course, there's tons of boring filler. Large chunks of it are filled with people having their tongue in Pitt's ear, praising his every move.Don't bother, if you've read a Dirk Pitt novel before. Nothing new here, besides the prelude."
2,Carol Burnett Volume (,A bit disappointing from the receiver of this gift. It doesn't sound like worth purchasing.
5,Gershwin Favorites at a Great Price!,"This CD might be called a tad anachronistic: Julius Katchen, Istvan Kertesz, Zubin Mehta, Lorin Maazel? The performances are very idiomatic, and these performances hold up well and they sound good. Katchen's Concerto in F is in mono, and his partner is Mantovani! The only quibble I have is that the orchestra in the Concerto sounds rather weak at times, but this does not hamper enjoyment. One should also have the performances by Earl Wild and Oscar Levant of these pieces, but these are also worth considering especially at the price."
1,Read this before you buy,"I bought one of these after receiving the xbox for christmas. I loved the slim design compared to the standard xbox controller. After a while I noticed the A button had a mind of it's own. I play Amped alot and to do a trick you have to hold down the A button (I think), and with out letting off the button the controller did it for me leaving my snowboarder laying flat on the hill. I can deal with this problem even though it happend often. What I can't deal with is........ One day I was playing (you guessed it Amped) and I was using the right thumbstick to do the ""grabs"" when the sucker just broke off hanging lifelessly in its little socket!! I strongly recommend that you don't buy this controller it is a piece of junk. In a month or two Microsoft is supposed to release the Japanese version controller. Supposedly it is a slimmer version of the standard one that came with your Xbox. Wait for this one to come out. Or you will be sorry."
1,Now looking for an old wire coat hanger,"Bought this a long time ago before I bought an HDTV. I had been using bunny ears and a digital converter box on an old analog tv and got all the over-the air channels w/o any issue. Plugged this into my new Samsung LED and now only receive 2/3 channels, and they skip out and lose the signal on a regular basis. No fidgeting with placement or directing the antenna helps. This is a complete waste of money. Wish I could return it."
3,Review From a Future Critic,"If you want a book with a fight that ends due to some great strategy get ""In Darkest Night"". This one uses an obvious strategy that really wouldn't work. And even if it did work, the enemy still wouldn't be down for the count. But I'm a collector of this series so I'm still glad I got this book."
2,Did anyone proof read this book before it was published?,"The format of this book has good intentions. Covers a topic, has a brief lab, sounds good, looks good at first.The biggest problem is that almost all of the labs have some type of confusing inaccuracy. Most of the lab diagrams contradict the accompanying configs (interfaces names and IP addresses are mixed up). Many diagrams show more than one interface on the same router with the same interface name...huh?It looks like the technical reviewer missed a thing or two..."
2,Not even close.,I am sorry to say this book is full of errors and does not even come close to the complexity level needed. There are far better Lab preparation books available. Don't throw your money away on this.
5,This is a must have for anyone considering taking the lab,"This book is a great study guide, I particularly liked the routing protocol chapters."
2,Good for what it was but somewhat disappointed,"I bought this book with the intention of learning about the features of the VMWare SDK and Virtual Infrastructure/ESX Servers scriptability/programmability. This book has some good information on programming the rest of VMWare's product line: GSX Server and Workstation, and seems to be targeted more towards the application developer/ISV who is seeking to automate their test/build cycle using VMWare products than the Network Engineer who is using VMWare to virtualize an enterprise's IT Environment. It covers a lot of information that seems out of place in a programming book, such as a chapter on creating a 'gold' image to use as a template for imaging systems, and information on basic VMWare server/workstation setup and configuration. If that is what you are looking for, then this book is for you. If you are trying to use VMWare's product line to virtualize your IT Infrastructure, then keep looking."
4,"Oh, but I CAN handle it...","This album is pretty good. I'm a longtime fan of The Annoying Music Show [here-on referred to as TAMS, for some reason], and that appears to be the only kind of fan of TAMS there is. I own all the previous albums. This one's a little weirder. Mr. Nayder, apparently trying to make good on his promise of you not being able to handle it, has added even more ba- I mean, annoying, music this time around. I'm always surprised by the number of songs I actually enjoy on these albums, but this is really for the Hardcore only.""Bacteria"" is funny, and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" will have you in stitches. But this album lacks replay value, unlike other TAMS albums. I hate to classify this as a ""Novelty Album-"" that's a great insult to Nayder and his work, but this lacks the certain oomph the others had. Hence the degradation to 4 stars.Still, if you think you can make it until you hear Ken Nordine at the end, you're in for a true test of endurance. Good luck, you'll need it."
5,"Fantastic, affordable solution to having to choose between skunked wine and over consuming","This product is easy to use and very effective. I have finished off a nice bottle of wine a week later and it still tasted great thanks to this device. This works MUCH better than those pumps, which I tried using for years with very poor results. The device is compact, easy to store and cheap!"
2,3 sharks / 300 pages,"If you want shark stories, stear clear of this book. Make no mistake; Marriot makes an incredible journey and has some amazing experiences. However, he has direct encounters with only three sharks and those all occured in one day. I would say 75% of this book is about Nicaragua's history and politics, 10% discusses shark mythology and 10% is a heavy handed attempt to draw metaphors between the two. This leaves 5% for actual sharks.In short, a big disappoint for shark fans. Instead, check out Shark Attacks : Their Causes and Avoidance by Thomas B. Allen."
4,The baby loves it,Since the baby loves it and it has a remote controlwhat else could I ask? It doesn't play just one songlike many others so it keeps it from getting boringfor me and the baby.
2,Heavy on Cases Light on Content,"Apply the cost of this book to the purchase of Robert S. Kaplan's ""The Balanced Scorecard"" and, perhaps, ""Cost & Effect."" (I'm assuming that almost every reader already has a copy of Michael Hammer's and James Champy's ""Reengineering the Corporation."") The author's tend to quote the leading authorities in activity based costing, balanced scorecards, and process reengineering liberally and follow each quote with an endless stream of supporting cases. Outside of these celebrity quotes and the mind-numbing quantity of cases, there is a surprising lack of content -- I'm almost tempted to write the authors to request a refund.(Believe me, this two-star rating is extremely generous!!!)"
4,"Works great, looks great",This squeegee works great. The glass in my shower is completely dry after using it except for a few loose drops of water. My only small complaint is that the handle is small and round which makes it a little more difficult to hold/control.
5,wonderful story,"Our pastor read this book as part of his sermon during our Christmas celebration. I loved it! It was a great story giving reasons for Christmas,getting the free stuff and helping the needy, but this curious little lizard finds out the true meaning of Christmas. I loved this story so much I wanted to buy it,(my neighbor attends the same church and said she got it from amazon) I bought two copies and my kids are 12 and 16. I gave one copy to my niece.(by the way Cory Edwards also wrote the screenplay of Hoodwinked, although I have not seen it I have heard it is a wonderful movie and family friendly)"
5,nice condition,"This came within a week of me ordering it, and it was in great condition. The box was worn, but I assumed that was age. No tears or rips, and the film was intact. Definitely reliable."
4,Hamilton Khaki King watch,"I am very happy with my watch - it is exactly as described, arrived on time and the packaging was very nice. It is a good size and very legible, however the stainless steel case does scratch easily."
2,Too New York centric,"If you are a New York baseball fan, this book is for you. If not, you'll feel left out. Nearly half the 356 pictures are of the Yankees,, Giants, and Brooklyn.Many of the photos are rare and not widely published, so I'll give Wallace credit for his research. But the book could have been more representative of baseball as a whole, outside the confines of New York."
2,kind of lame,"I had a 'King of the Hill' game as a youngster. It was a large-ish green and grey plastic mountain. It was so much more fun to play this same game in that genre than this bland, small plastic green square. The old version had a yellow crown that popped-up when a player's marble token finally made it to the top. Could the current manufacturer consider returning to the original venue??? It was a blast! the new version is downright boring."
3,The Very Best of Bert Weedon,I guess I thought it would be a little better. I really never heard of this person and I was comparing him to others that I have.
3,Just OK - Wobbly,"This piece was relatively easy to assemble, however we weren't able to mount the organizer to the wall since our baseboards made it impossible to have the unit sit flush with the wall.The unit is a little wobbly as the screw-on feet were not completely flat. I am not unsatisfied or satisfied with this product."
5,Learn from the Expert!,"This book is not some purely theoretical work, but a very practical book from THE expert on this subject. Don Burleson has tons of HANDS-ON experience, and VAST EXPERIENCE with Oracle. You won't find a more competent expert in the field."
2,A very basic book,"If you aldready know the basiscs like what pan, tilt, dolly, crane and tracking shots are you know as much as this book will tell you.I am a film student and currently working on a tv show. I bought this book to augment my school studies in film but found it to be way too basic for me. It can be an excellent starter book for someone interesting in learning what the different camera angles are called. If you are someone you has never even though or analyzed the various angles before this book MIGHT be helpful. But a warning it does not always use the common terms as in the case of the dutch tilt, it barely mention that this angle is sometimes called that when it reality is most commonly refered to as such."
3,Sometimes less is more,"Who am I to complain about anything Ute does. She's perfect. Really. I do wish though that this had been produced with a bit less lavishness. This music sounds best with a small ensemble, and I'm afraid Ute will never revisit these songs for c.d. and perform them as she does some of them live."
4,Good,"This book was good, what I liked about it was everyones secrets including the mainly characters came it. It shows that you really don't know people, the book was so good that I wrote about in my blog [...]"
3,Okay,Okay read. You have to be careful when dealing with people. I still don't know how they pulled it off.
3,MEN... pay attention cause you'll never know if you don't,The book is about two gold-diggin' friends Tina and Celess.I'm not going to spoil it for the rest of you who haven't read it.I thought the book was okay even though it was a fast read.But I will say that Miasha let the secret out too soon.My brother read it up until the secret was revealed and threw the book down.
3,Nice Read,"I enjoyed this book, even though I don't know how they pulled it off. I am going to get Never Enough because I would love to find out what goes on next."
3,Below Expectations,"Because I'd like to try using a bamboo cutting board, I am keeping this one...but I'd suggest to others to consider buying from a different manufacturer (not Totally Bamboo). When I got this cutting board, it had many tiny splinters, and I had to sand it with fine sandpaper. It still has a few splinters, though, and I am worried that new ones will surface each time I wash it. The cutting board is nice looking (as you can tell from the pictures), and I think it will be durable, but the splinter issue definitely concerns me, as I don't want the splinters to contaminate the food I cut on the board or get lodged in my skin (thus far this hasn't happened, but I have only had the board for a day)."
3,The definitive version is yet to come...,"Being a big fan of Ray Harryhausen, I bought this book back in the late 70's for $17.50 (a tidy sum at the time). Nothing else was available on Harryhausen, and the book was much appreciated. However, its pictures are mostly black and white, and there is not much to read or revealed by Harryhausen, who was still making films at the time.Be aware: there are three different editions of the book, the last covers all Ray's films.In April, ""An Animated Life"" will be released, with full color and lots of text. But if you see this in a used book store and it's not too expensive, pick it up. Even now it's considered a collector's item."
3,"Glorious singers, not so great conducting","This recording of Aida is perhaps not the best available, but captures Tebaldi and Del Monaco at their prime. They sound glorious here. And lets not forget the great Ebe Stignani. Besides that, it's not an expensive set, so if you can manage without stereo sound this is not a bad option to know Verdi's masterpiece. My problem here is Erede. It's not about his tempi. It's about his lack of any depth and personality. Personally and even with great singers I cannot fully enjoy a recording or a performance with a sloppy conductor."
4,Enjoyable music. Playlist is in Chinese.,"I very much enjoy the instrumentation and mastery of the music. My complaint is the play list: When I listen to it with Windows Media Player, the play list is in Chinese. To find a specific section, one has to compare the notes in the book with the length of time for each section."
1,totally waste of money,"this is huge piece of hard, plastic trash! I was so excited with this purchase, I bought this for my 8 years old nephew, since it is expensive I had higher expectations, a total disappointment, both for me and my nephew."
2,Get a Real band!!!,"This album was a big disappointment for me. Jani Lane just turned his back on metal all together. He sings very flat, following in the new age buzz crap style. The band is as talented as crickets chirping. Bland with no flare what so ever. One guitar solo that is very lame. No great guitar, drums, or bass solos which is something very needed here. I've read some of the reviews, and they cover the Warrant album too. As for the Warrant album, I thought it was fairly good, lacking in songwriting, and I also think that without Jani, it's not Warrant. It's very clear to me that without each other, we're only going to get sub-par. In a battle of the bands, I would have to go with Warrant, just because they stuck to their roots."
4,Excellent read regardless what you know about Bears.,"I first came across this story on a trip to Alaska. Needless to say the folks in Alaska have little affection for Timothy Treadwell (his real name was Timothy Dexter according to the book) before or after his death. I know little about the ursine species however, I certainly have a far greater respect and understanding of these extraordinary animals after reading Jans' book. I find of great interest in the early pages of the book, the gullible and almost naive acceptance given to Treadwell by his Hollywood sponors and even some within the educational establishments he catered to, to gain credibility (and money) for his ""research"".This book is certainly worth the time to read especially if you find the politics and popularity of wildlife, and Alaska's ecotourisim all wrapped into one tragic story."
4,"A worthy rebuttal to ""Grizzly Man""","Because of the success of Werner Herzog's movie, ""Grizzly Man,"" the world thinks that it knows Timothy Treadwell. While Herzog treats Treadwell as an emotionally and socially defective person, Jans is much more sympathetic. He provides a respectful, richer, and more rounded portrait of Treadwell than does ""Grizzly Man.""As a result, Jans is probably insufficiently critical of Treadwell. Treadwell was ""protecting"" a healthy grizzly population in a national park, indulged by the National Park Service despite flaunting its rules, and engaging in unsafe practices that ended in the death of two people and two grizzlies. An overall assessment of the man must take this into account.After telling Treadwell's story, the second half of this book turns to Jans' musings on humans' relations with bears, and wildlife more generally. This was less successful than the first half of the book. Even so, Jans is a talented writer and the book moves along very nicely."
2,It's Like Beating A Dead Bear.,"Too much ink was wasted on Jans' theories of Treadwell's possible motives, and which individual bear actually killed Timothy & Amie. Contradictory Interviews with park officials, and biologists who knew him or crossed his path was, I thought overdone and repititious.I totally agree with one other reviewer who thought this book could have been much shorter, in fact it probably could have been pared down to magazine article size without losing anything. I do give Jans' credit for his exhaustive research, attention to detail, and attempt,to remain neutral regarding Treadwell."
1,Junk,Like one of the other people who commented. I got a black pump with a plastic handle.....Mine to broke before I could even use it. The needle was already busted out of package....DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
2,Wrong model,"The pump I got from BIGFLYSPORTS was different from the picture (black color, plastic handle). The needle was crooked and broke on first use."
4,Great product,I purchased this switch for a bedroom and has truly come in handy. My only issue is if you flip the switch too fast it doesn't have time to connect so it doesn't work. You just have to take your time.
3,aaarrrghh.... E codes only?,"First, I'll preface by saying these work great and last a good long time. Second, I'll express dismay over not realizing that the one I already had in place as an alternate pool light switch is obviously an ""E"" and the two units I just ordered and received are also (wait for it...) EXACTLY... ""E"" SWITCHES.I need to return these for A, B, C or D's and make sure my order sends two distinctly coded units, not two of the same. Can this be requested via Amazon???"
3,"Poor Quality, Wouldn't Recommend.","I was disappointed with this product, and ended up returning it.The switch emits a fairly loud buzzing noise when the switch it turned on. There is nowhere for a grounding wire on the light switch. Both switches (especially the wireless one) feel loose and cheap. The wireless one is overly sensitive, and it turns off the light when bumped slightly.I was extremely optimistic about this product, as it seemed to solve my problem perfectly, but the product was of such poor quality that it wasn't worth using. I wouldn't recommend this - it seems great in theory, but you're better off to find another solution.(I gave it three stars because it did meet the basic functionality described, it was just unusable in my opinion)"
1,Poor Signal,"This was easy to setup and install, but the auxiliary switch works maybe once every eight times, even ten feet from the base. I would not recommend this."
3,"A little quirky, but worthwhile.","I got this set to move a light switch that was behind a dresser to a more useful place beside the door so I only use the remote, battery-operated switch.If you move the remote switch partway it will trigger, or if you move it too quickly it sometimes triggers twice or not at all. Also, I tried to switch over to energy-saving bulbs and found that with this switch installed they could not be shut off.The in-wall switch has a strange toggle next to the normal switch that is hard to manage. During installation it slipped to a halfway point and neither switch would function until I figured it out.There's a few quirks with using this product but it is overall decent and does what it is intended to."
3,UNRELIABLE,"When I purchased and installed my FIRST Heath Zenith BL-6133-WH wireless switch, I was extremely pleased with its design and function. Mistakes- I did not keep the receipt. In less than two years it quit working. Changed the battery but no dice. So I ordered a replacement from Amazon becasue the unit was perfect for my application. The replacement came, installed it, it did not work.Called the Customer Service desk at heath Xenith, described the problem, and they promptly sent me a replacment, and so far it is working fine. I am definately keeping the reciept handy."
4,Works like advertised,We had a switch that was five steps into the dark and block walls.This was the perfect alternative for us. It works just like its advertised for us.Home Depot used to carry then but has left that to faithful Amazon. With shipping it was the same price as Home Depot used to sell it for. Recommended.
2,Doesn't work most of the time,Not happy with this product. You have to turn the switch on and off several times to get it to work.
4,Brilliant concept,"...but the execution is somewhat iffy! Specifically, the remote switch is very temperamental and the light it controls tends to come on and off of its own accord. Overall, it is a good product with a couple of bugs - still worth getting however."
1,Does not fully shut off,After installing the switch I tried the remote from various areas of the house. It worked great and seemed to work properly.Once it got dark outside it quickly became evident that the switch does not fully shut off electricity. The bulbs glowed instead of shutting down. This was the case if I shut them off using the wall switch or the remote. The original switch workes fine so it isn't the wiring.Basically a waste of money and effort.
2,I still haven't recieved my package,"There was some sort of screw up with the postal service and they claim the package was delivered, but I have yet to receive it and it's now been four weeks. I know the company I bought it from can't really do much because there end of the purchase was apparently technically fulfilled, but I have yet to receive the package and all they told me was it was marked as received and if someone stole it then thats a federal crime. So I'm now without a Polaroid camera and out like $20."
3,Oops... I dropped it again,"This camera feels like hold a huge sandwich. This thing almost slipped out of my hands when I was tired, but the bad thing was when the retailer swept the dust off the camera to show it to me. And then BANG! he took a picture of me when I least suspect it. The flash stunned me for a while...If you are short of funds and size matters, this is okay as it is.The thing that disapointed me was that when I tried to take a picture, I had to look through the little hole with my unperfect vision. It's like lokking at a one centimeter squared picture and you want to see the details.Since I don't want to type more, you must read other reviews of the other cameras. It's not my fault if I like to critic products... people even told me to... huh... read books, because i'm 15 and I spend a lot of time buying stuff."
4,This book is used in a 4th level Entrepreneurship Consulting class,I mentor and the Professor I volunteer for loves this book and pushes the students to actually read it and continue to use as a reference. I would recommend it highly.
4,Greatest Book Ever,"This book is exellent if your a horseback rider like me! Christina Reese is an eighth grader. From her strawberry blond hair to her riding boots she is all rider. Her parents own a racing stable and her mother is a profecianal race horse jockey, but Christina doesn't want to race horses. She begged her mom to buy her Sterling a 4 year old racing mare. The first 2 weeks Christina has Sterling,Sterling is her dream horse,but after that sterling is becoming a nightmare. She's been running out on jumps or rushing them.Christina even broke her rist and lost her nerve to ride Sterling. With the event so close how can she train her horse. Everybody wants a girl name Cassidy Smith to ride Sterling. Christina finally allows her to ride Sterling. This is an exiting story for a horse lover! You have got to read it!"
4,"Good, but I liked the old ones better","I like the Thoroughbred books now, but I think that they where a LOT better with the old characters. Each time it was about new characters, I liked the old ones better, so I think that the current ones are good, but the old ones were better."
2,Wheres racing???,"What Christina says about racing, I can say the same about 3 day eventing. Christina dislikes racing and I totatly dislike eventing and jumping and that stuff. The Thoroughbred series was meant to be for racing and now racing is completly gone a eventing is totatly gone. I cant seem jumping around and not running your fastest can be much fun. Racing takes more heart and speed than anything. I almost put the book away forever since I didnt like it but I forced myself to finish it. Isnt Cassidy Smith Cindy and Max's daughter? Oh yea, what happened to Cindy? And Ashleigh's second baby? In the last few books everything was Cindy and Champion, and now, you can be lucky to even hear cindys name. I didnt like Cindy much either but at least racing was always in her blood. I dont know how Ashleigh and Mikes daughter can be a jumper instead of a jockey or excerise rider. If u want to talk to me, u can find me at Blades60@aol.com"
5,"I like the book, but what happened to Cindy and the others?","I've read all the books in the series and they're all good, but #1.Why isn't Karen Bently writing anymore? #2.What happened to all the others-Sammy just going off to Ireland and la-di-da-da? Then Cindy just disappears,and Mandy,Max, and whoever else just dies, disappears...what? I think it's really cool that you guys are coming out with new books so soon! My friend and I are really interested in these books. Can you do a book on Western riding somehow and keep it in the series? My name's Brittani and could you e-mail me back? at cschmidt@uwc.edu? Thanks for reading!"
2,I don't know what to think........,"I know that when I haven't ridden a horse in two weeks after injuring myself I can just climb on my horse and win a three day event, especially if, b/c I didn't get right back on after I fell off, I had become terrified of horses.I hate Cassidy. Where in the world did she come from and WHY is she here? Why did she even have her own book? Did anyone else ever really care about her THAT much? I don't see anyone crying themsevles to sleep because they loved her so much.Unorginal and unbelievable. I disliked this book."
2,Average,"Looking of hand exerciser that was not metal as those squeaked too much after 1 month, Found this one and was not impressed. Pinches hand when you use it, the resistance was not near enough, might be good for a beginner who has very weak hands or perhaps recovering from surgery of some kind on the hand or wrist. Be carefull of the pinching it catches you of gaurd and ouch!"
3,without the game it is useless...,Useless without the game. Once my daughter took the partsd off and put them back...then what? BORING. Get the game I guess it seems to give you something to do with this toy.
1,Never got the item,"After waiting four months, and after many unfilfilled promises from the supplier, Amazon gave me a refund."
2,return it,"at first look and feel i thought i would love this control pad.. till i started to play and had to press the X Y A B buttonsget a hammer out,, to make em work"
2,Terrible controller,"This is a nice looking controller compared to the one X-box comes with. Unfortunately, it's not durable. After playing Dead Or Alive for few minuites the right trigger got stucked, the spring in it seems to malfunction. It's terrible come to think I didn't even exerted so much force on it. The reaction of the controller seems to be slower than microsoft's controller. For a few more bucks, I think microsoft's controller is far more superior in quality."
2,So much potential... but a HUGE probelm!,"I knew this was the controller I wanted the minute I saw it. It was smaller than the regular controller, with a button layout that is a little more sensible. It ""looks"" like the perfect Xbox contoller... but unfortunately, it's not. The problem? You HAVE to press the buttons ALL the way down to register and you have to do it HARD, which leads me to believe that they are not pressure sensitive whatsoever. The ONLY thing they register is brute force. My poor 90lb wife couldn't muster a single punch or kick against me in DOA3. My suggestion... wait just a little longer and buy an imported Japanese controller. It has a very similar layout and is about the same size as well, however, the quality is that of an original controller. Sorry Mad Catz, you blew it... did you even TRY to use your controller before you released it? Please don't waste your money on this, it'll only caused frustration and madness... trust me on this."
4,Good alternative,"I bought these controllers for many reasons:They were 20% less than the standard MS controllers.Their buttons are spaced further apart than the MS controllers and I made fewer mistakes that way. I also like the various controller colors which make sense during LAN parties. The rubber grips are nice. The overall size is just right: not too big, not too small.I have no experience with pressure sensitive buttons as described in other reviews."
2,Buying this controller = risk,Seemed to be an OK controller. The first non-Ms one I got. After some very limited uses (a few Halo lan fests) the top left pad's spring busted.A friend liked the button config (different than ms) and the grips on the sides. Triggers seemed to be pretty muc the same as the other brands.
4,A 1st in a fantastic series of the 80's!,"I remember reading this entire series back in the day. Although some were not as good as others, they were still very much enjoyable.Now I'm excitied to read the all-new novel in this series - The Musashi Flex!Good stuff this."
2,A Tad Disappointing,"This is a tautly written mystery by an oustanding writer. The one thing this book shares with ""Life Penalty"" is an unsympathetic protagonist. I didn't like Jess at all. (I detested Gail in ""Life Penalty."") I didn't like the inappropriate way Jess and her brother in law Barry would needle her. She would get on the defensive and make inappropriate responses and rise to what she perceived to be his bait. Barry really was not the ogre she claimed him to be in the story. I didn't like the ending, either. Like ""Life Penalty,"" the story ends on an unsatisfactory murder note. Again, this was well written, but it really was a let down."
3,Different,"I am a big fan of the Behemoth sound. I have Thelema 6 and Zos Kia Cultus. Boy was I suprised when I heard this when it came in from their label (not from off the wall place, and I asked Nergal himself about the box set and he said it is legit). The sound is very primitive, raw black metal so if you are a fan of Mayhem and the like you will not be disappointed. As to fans of Behemoth wishing to hear there old sound ""be aware"""
3,it was good but not great,"Well i am as big as it gets when it comes to Tori fans so u can imagine that i wanted to get this item right away. When Tori was actually talking it was Great, but unfortunately that was only half of the CD. The rest was just a bunch of people talking about her. Hey if i wanted other people to talk about Tori, i will ask my friends. I was kinda disappointed, but it is Tori and also the booklet is nice so it gets 3 stars."
2,Midi Cable obsolete - not for win 7,"Turtle beach no longer supports the MIDI cable. An unsupported driver is still available for Vista, But Win 7 is not supported."
1,Not for amateurs,I basically bouthe the product for the cables which work fine. I have similar software but loaded the Music Studio Kit for grins. Right away I received a Microsoft compatability warning. After playing around a bit I finally got it loaded. You have to know what you're doing for this product to provide satisfaction. I was able to get most of the functions to work although response time was slow. As I said...the cables work fine.
1,Wrong Movie,I just received the DVD High School Hellcats but when I put in the DVD I noticed that the movie on the disc is actually Return To Treasure Island. I'd be satisfied if that was what I ordered but it's not. Even the disc itself says High School Hellcats on the front but it's the wrong movie. This is a serious mistake.
4,"Not the best in the series, but still good","This truly is a good book. It's not only for kids though, I think adults would enjoy this series also. My personal favorites are:1: The Ruby Raven (#3)2: The Viking Claw (#4)3: The Coral Coffin (#5)I would HIGHLY recommend this series to everyone. It is kind of strange, I'll admit it, but worthy of reading."
3,"ok, long story, religious","I bought this book because of the Nordic connection. I bought it without viewing the inside. If I had seen it beforehand, I probably would not have bought it. The story (text) is too long for a primary age child. The book has a religious undertone to it, which was not noted in the Amazon description. I don't think my daughter has ever finished the book because it is too long for her (5-year-old). The illustratioins are pretty. It was probably fun to make, but as a reader of lots of children's literature, not one of my favorites."
2,For under $20...is ok...for a rental property,"If you are going for the price, just ok. Is light, thin pipe, and made in China. If you are using for a rental property, then it will do its job. I would not recommend if you are using for higher end shower system (i.e. Grohe, Hansgrohe, etc -- made in Germany). Is no comparison to those type of quality. Is like comparing a BMW 335 to a Hyundai Sonata."
3,"Works ok, could be easier to read","It seems like all these home cholesterol test kits suffer from this same problem - results are hard to read accurately. The color change starts out strong, then gradually gets lighter and lighter. Interpretation of the ending point (you are supposed to read the very highest number next to any color change at all) is somewhat subjective; two people could read very different numbers.I also have to wonder why a lookup chart is needed at all - the numbers printed on the unit are a direct scale, and the lookup chart to covert those numbers to cholesterol readings are a direct scale. Why not just print the cholesterol numbers on the unit itself and do away with the conversion chart altogether?"
3,Lots of advertising,"Once the DVD is inserted, it takes nearly 6 minutes to start the exercise routine. Those first few minutes are advertisement after advertisement after advertisement. Never before have I had an exercise DVD (or any other kind of DVD) with so much advertising that the viewer is forced to watch before the exercises come on. It's blatant advertising and a waste of time. The exercises are okay but I have better on other DVDs. If you can stand all the advertising at the beginning and if you want a bit of variety to you abs routine, this DVD is okay, but only just okay. Nothing special about this DVD."
5,California Vieja,I ordered the book less than a week before a university class began. It arrived in excellent condition and in time for me to take the book with me. I highly recommend this vendor.
5,Excellent,"I have tried several relaxers in the past, and this is positively the best relaxer I have ever used. The formula is very mild, which rarely leads to burns. After using the conditioner my hair feels smooth and silky. If you are having trouble choosing a mild yet effective relaxer, this may very well be for you."
2,Confusing,"I'm surprised this hasn't gotten reviewed; Parshall/Tulley recommended it in ""Shattered Sword"" (an excellent book) as a corrective to the view that the Axis defeat was economically inevitable. It isn't that.While it is a worthwhile read, adding clarity to various battles and campaigns, and avoiding the sort of detail that flips several pages for you, Overy contradicts himself and his argument regularly.Not only does it not debunk the 'economic outcome' view, it re-enforces it.As a corrective to this claim, ""The Wages of Destruction"" (Adam Tooze) does a good job."
3,"Arkanoid style game, with one big problem","This game is in the style of Arkanoid and Breakout, and has good gameplay with acceptable PS1 graphics. It has a nice gimmick by which you can buy power-ups at the beginning of a level if you did well on the previous level. There are 10 ""worlds"" with 10 levels. Unfortunately, the game does not allow you to save your progress -- a major flaw. It's slightly compensated by the fact that you always have access to the first level of all the worlds, so you get some variety. It also has a 2-player version which is fun, and it's cheap enough that it's a good value for those who like this sort of game."
4,"Again, I wish I could give 4.5","This album rocked my expectations. We've all heard Amber's slew of dance crazy anthems, every compilation a year or two ago had one or another. She was inescapable. And her lyrics seemed very trite.Amber has...well, grown up. It seems that way, at least. She still talks about love and loss, but who doesn't? Her music is less remixable, even though people will do it anyway. Her titles are a bit more mature, and her themes are as well. The music is darker, and more enlightening. It showcases her softer voice perfectly. I love this album.The highlights are You move Me, Sacrificial Lamb, Private War...Really listen to everything, it's great.She lost a star for the lyrical monotony though. While the themes and lyrics are matured and interesting, you kinda get tired of hearing how she's been screwed over by men. Oh well, can't have it all. Still a GREAT album!"
1,How to Stuff a Wild Bikini,"Lacked the ""summer beachy"" feel, too much Eric Von Zipper, the songs were lame, Annette and Dwayne just didn't have the magic she & Frankie have together. I missed seeing Don Rickles in a key role, but most of all, I missed seeing Frankie in the starring role. Sorry, I really wanted to like it, but it missed the mark big time."
3,What About Releasing The Others On DVD?,"The sound quality and video quality are pretty good on this DVD, better than anything you would see on VHS. The DVD disc plays on both sides, full screen on one side and wide screen on the other. But as most people know, this was the least popular Annette beach movie. The only reason I purchased this was to see what could be possible for the other beach movies on DVD. But currently, this is the only one on DVD. Where are the rest?"
2,Like a Disney film directed by Andy Sidaris.,"Too silly. Too leering.Even more hackneyed than others. Bad songs. Little cleverness.A supporting cast of lesser interest, to me anyway. (No Susan Hart, no Don Rickles, no Donna Loren, darn little Buster Keaton and Bobbi Shaw- and she's a brunette here).Watchable at best."
5,Well Made works as expected.,"This stapler is well made, and should last a long time. It has a chart on the base with the staple sizes to use for different document thickness very handy."
5,Great purchase!,"This book is a must-have for anyone interested in becoming a library media specialist. It is an excellent source of information and practically required by the ALA, since that is who co-wrote it. It is also absolutely necessary if you're taking the Library Media Specialist Praxis test. A lot of the questions come from this book."
1,Horrible phone,Range is not great. Sync feature doesn't work with Outlook if you have Exchange (Corporate e-mail) so that feature was totally useless for me (main reason I bought the phone). Who has time to manually enter 400 phone numbers... Battery life stinks - it lasts about 20 minutes on speaker phone. And if you place the phone on the charging base to recharge it disconnects the call. I make lots of calls where I get put on hold for extended periods and I'm a slave to the phone unless I put it on speakerphone. It doesn't have the battery life for me to leave it on speakerphone and it hangs up if I try to recharge it. I have to juggle two phones which get drained to low battery in no time at all. Stupid design. Total junk.
2,Battery life isn't all that,"The old phone I had was heavy, and the battery life was horrible. You have to put this phone on the charger every night or you won't have a phone in the morning even if you don't use it that much. I thought for the price that it would be the best phone in the world. To my suprise the only great thing is that it's not heavy."
2,Where has quality gone?,"Certainly not into the Uniden CLX485, thats for sure. I have owned plenty of cordless phones in my day and to be honest, I wish I could go back in time to buy up all the older phones.I am just one person and I dont know about everybody else, but what would be the very FIRST requirement for a ""good"" phone to have? Sound quality. Second? Battery life. Anything after that is icing.The sound completely sucks on this phone. There is a constant hum and the voices sound slightly distorted and low. Whle changing the volume does increase the decibel level, it also increases all the annoying sound coming from this phone.If youre looking for the same quality phone that your old 900/2.8 had, good luck. If you find yourself reading reviews about how good this phone sounds, think skeptically about who's writing it.I did not invest any money in this phone. It was a gift and I am embarassed that I will have to return the gift.."
2,Not A Weightloss Dvd!!,"I purchased this dvd, because I had seen Trudie Styler on the Regis and Kelly show. A couple of her moves that day, looked like they worked ur legs/hips well. But when I put in the dvd, those harder poses were NOT on this dvd!! This will Not Bring On a Sweat, unless of course you are NOT a Practing Yogi, or maybe if you Do NOT Exercise Much, U May feel something! lol I would suggest YOu buy the Biggest Loser Yoga for Weight Loss, Now that Dvd, will have ur heart pumping, and u sweating in the first 15 minutes!! I do like Trudie's dvd, but only for a good stretch workout, it doesn't feel like a weightloss dvd, but, rather a nice, gentle Yoga workout."
3,Instructional Errors,"I tried out Trudie Styler's Weight Loss Yoga for the first time today. I chose to do the total body yoga workout. It had great potential to win me over. However, verbal instruction is very important to me in yoga practice and I am disappointed to report that there are errors. A couple are somewhat minor, such as being told to bend the wrong knee or turn the wrong foot. But, the one that is most aggravating is being told to lunge the wrong foot forward. Once I realize I'm working on the wrong side it throws off the whole flow to switch my stance. I even rewound the DVD to be sure I listened correctly, and then still doubting myself I did the workout a second time. Sure enough, there are definately mistakes. This discourages me from the workout because I know I have to be alert to compensate for this."
4,Excellent reference book,"I got this book since Mythology was one of my modules at University. It doesn't go into a great amount of detail for every single mythology, however it is very precise with the information on most of the major mythologies (Chinese, Christian, Egyptian, Norse, Hindu). It was very useful for both assignments that I had to write for the module and I decided to keep this book after finishing because it's such a useful source of interesting information."
3,resource book,Not the easy read I had hoped for but I blame myself. I should have discovered more about it before ordering.
5,A wonderful heritage!,This set of books by Beverly Cleary is a true treasure! My Mom read it as a child and so did I. Children will love the episodes and adults usually get as much pleasure. I highly recommend this series and other titles from Mrs. Cleary.
5,"It's NOT ""the way""...","...nor does it EVER purport to be. The ""Michael"" entity could care less if you believe or not. I've read the Michael material for over 25 years now, and I keep returning to it, because for me, it answers a lot of the questions I have. Not all of them, assuredly, but enough. It's helped me in my relationships - relationships of all kinds. It helps to understand the paths others follow in this life.Definitely worth the money, time, and energy to read!"
2,Not that funny,"I am a big fan of audiobooks as I travel by car a great deal. I was looking forward to several hours of humor and wit, and regrettably this audio collection was a disappointment. While the stories as written may be funny, the reader's delivery for the most part was not. Roberts reads aloud well and I enjoyed his selections, but the women chosen as readers were not as successful. I found myself skipping past stories rather than listening to another grating interpretation."
1,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,I NEVER DID YOGA AND BEING OVER 66 YEARS OLD I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD HELP ME GET STARTED. CAN NOT DO THESE EXERCISES BECAUSE OF A BACK PROBLEM. FOR ME THIS BOOK HAS NO VALUE. SORRY.
3,quotable but not really a keeper...,"The first 5 chapters have useful info and quotes...then it got ""strange"" from there...the idea of apostolic delegates and such. Once again, several good quotes but I am reselling my copy:)As with just about everything I have read on elders, you will find some practical opinions that are more from tradition thanScripture. Personally I think we can make a distinction between that which violates Scripture and that which the Scriptures may be silent."
3,Lovecraft's First Film Adaption is Decent,"This is a decent adaption of H.P. Lovecraft and while generally regarded higher than most of them by critics it lacks the entertainment value of even something like Bleeders, even more so Unnamable, Castle Freak and Lurking Fear. There's not even any spice in another older film adaption like Dunwhich Horror. A straight forward gothic film that lacks the modern convieniences of gore and nudity. The more recent Resurrected based also on the same novel, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, is a superior film version of this story. Recommended for diehard Lovecraft fans and diehard old school gothic film fans only."
3,Saved by DVD,"Although I only gave this film three stars its worth a look. Its large sets, swirling fog, moody lighting and great cast set it apart from other B films of this time period. The quality of the DVD is excellant. Vincent Price playing a man torn between right and wrong is always worth watching. A great film for Halloween."
3,Good Effort,"This is a screen adaption of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"". It is reasonably faithful, but lacks the heavy atmosphere of horror that all of Lovecraft's stories have. Still, for one of the first attempts at bringing such a difficult story to the screen, it's a better than average try. No excess nudity or unnecessary violence are added, but certain scenes do have the requisite level of creepiness to satisfy most Lovecraft fans. Not a masterpiece, but a good effort."
3,Steps don't work!,"I have another book by Gary Bouton and it is quite well written. Unfortunately, this one is not, at least not in the beginning chapters. I have gotten through the first few chapters but not without considerable difficulty. I can only assume that Gary was working with a prerelease version of CS since the steps he lists simply do not work as indicated much of the time and I know his quality standard is generally high. This is so frustrating that I just wanted to put down the book and find another. Chapter one is CS basics, and if you don't get the basics, it is difficult to go any farther. I tried the SAMS Publishing website for errata but found none. If you already have a good understanding of Photoshop, the book should be much easier to follow and offer some excellent tips and procedures,however, I would not recommend it for a beginner."
1,Nauseating and superficial.,"The Kirkus Review was right on. This book disappointed me. I had hoped to read how Albright overcame some of her personal as well as professional challenges. Instead, very little of Albright was presented. The author (or is he Albright's publicist and spin doctor) spends his time gloating and bragging about how great she is. After reading the book, I didn't feel as if I knew any more about her than when I started."
2,Disappointing,"I have loved ISC for years...but while this cd SOUNDS good, they seem to have lost the edge they once had and have gone more commercial. Some of the songs here can be found on the EP in different, harder mixes. It's all just a little too smooth here. I am also disappointed that they have not progressed forward in theme....it seems they are hung up on this angel verses man war theme...or a demonic/religious theme. It's ok, but they have done it before on the brilliant ""Holy"" and did it better.Two songs are good on here, I will say. ""Fading Light"" is a great EBM piece, and perhaps the best song on this cd. The second is ""Promised Land"". The other songs are just way too slow and bland to be of much interest. ISC is at it's best when it does EBM, which is not this cd.It just lacks substance. But it's good pop if you're looking for less that won't stay with you. Get ""Holy"" instead or the EP"
4,Definitely worth it!,"Take a bit of Michael Crichton, toss in some Stephen King, and you've got a good idea of what it's like to read ""Final Transmission."" It's a gripping tale that kept me glued to the pages, eager to find out what happens. I was intrigued by the idea that, at the moment of death, a certain part of the human brain emits a high-frequency signal. I was also curious to see if there was a connection between the ever-more frightening dreams the lead character was experiencing, and the experiments he was conducting to lock on to this transmission.One of the best things about the story is that it's believable. The characters aren't ""larger than life,"" they're the kind of people you know - the good ones and the jerks alike. The story is not some apocalyptic Überdrama, and Wilcox avoids the annoyingly cliché ""it's up to one man to save the world"" drivel that it seems so many authors rely on now. It's a great, fast read."
1,...and you can't even get it fixed,"Not only did the underside of the scanner glass develop a serious haze, but it's not possible to get the scanner fixed. I've been on the phone with HP several times and can't even find a service center. Piece o' junk, will be going to recycling soon."
1,I returned *two* of these scanners!,"This scanner was appealing because of the low cost/features combo. The first one we received worked alright for about 100 pages worth of scanning then the ADF started to pull more and more to one side very quickly resulting in jamming every page into a little ball. We called HP, they called it defective and took it back.Second scanner, I had only half-unpacked the unit when I realized that the 'cancel' button on the front panel had been crushed down into the chassis. Called HP, they called it defective and took it back.I'm looking at the Xerox DocuMate 510 now, hopefully it won't fall apart."
1,don't buy!!!,"This product is a piece of junk! it will not work with windows xp. if you possibly get by the error messages, your paper will jam in the feeder. I even tried tech group for help. They could not even help. Called vendor realtions to get a refund, no luck there either. I might as well flush my money down the toilet!"
3,HP Scanner Decent Product,"The HP Scanjet 5590 has performed pretty much as described. It was an excellent value, providing lots of features, such as transparency/negative scanning and document feeder, usually found in much pricier units. The user interface could be much better, especially when stacked up against other HP products...and the transformation for negative scanning is needlessly cumbersome. But on the whole it is a solid product, and if you're running Vista 64-bit, it's absolutely the best buy to be had."
3,Interesting Material,"While I found this DVD documentary to be interesting, I am not sure it will work for what I intended.I am a high school teacher at a continuation high school. I will be doing a unit with my classes on juvenile justice. I thought this PBS video would fit right into my lesson plans. However, after reviewing it, I found it to be too long on ""talking heads"", and too short on action. I fear that if I played it in class, my students would quickly get bored with it, and lose interest. So, sadly, I am stuck with it. I might give it to another teacher, at a different, more advanced, school."
3,a nice attempt,"Being a massive Garbage fan, I bought the star profile to add to my collection of Garbage memorabilia. The cd documentary is nice, the interviews are good. The documentary gives information that you can find anywhere, however. The book has good pictures, but the writing is very poor. It is full of grammatical errors and some of the information isn't correct, such as where they say Butch's real name is Brian Vig when it is really Bryan Vigorson. I would suggest that people only get this star profile if you are a huge fan and want to add to your collection."
4,this album rocks,"this album shows shirly manson at her best, i own all the garbage albums and i cant wait for a new one"
3,o.k but not her best,"I enjoyed the characters. The beginning half is a bit tiresome with a certain characters self doubt, but after the halfway point the story takes off. Truly enjoyable ending."
3,Quicky battery meter,"This meter will show if a battery is good or bad but will not go beyond that. A ""good"" battery might still be ""iffy"".You get what you pay for!"
2,Great at first,"I had been searching in stores for years for an inexpensive battery tester like this. So you can understand my excitement when I found this one. It was great for the firs 2 months then all of a sudden it just stopped functioning. MAybe I used to much since I had a pile of batteries to check (and it paid for itself considering al the batteries I found useable), but do wish it had lasted a lot longer. Was going to get oen for work, but not now."
5,WOW,"I literally lived with this book for 2 weeks, taking it with me everywhere to read every time a minute or two was allowed. This is McCammon's greatest work and I know since I have collected all his work. It made me thankful for even the simplist things like opening my refridgerator to get something to eat or a drink. The book consumed me. READ IT!!!"
5,One of the best books.,If you like The Stand by Stephen King you'lll love this book. This is one of the few books I could not put down once I started reading it.Great characters and a great story. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
3,It has its moments . . .,"This is not a bad book, although its not what you would call a ""power"" novel. As an alternative, or in addition to, I would recommend not only Stephen King's ""The Stand,"" but even more, what I found to be the most definitive Apocalyptic novel of all, Glen Kleier's ""The Last Day,"" which is indeed a powerful and scary suspense thriller. But Swan is not a bad read, as most books go."
1,I think the review system is broken,I thought that given the high number of good reviews this was a shoe-in. Wrong. I don't understand how this book could get so many good reviews. It is a jumble of nonsense. I will never believe the Amazon review system again. Would this book even be listed in the New York Times Book Review. I think not.
3,Nuclear Survivors,"All in all this is a great book. My rating is only because I felt it to close to King's The Stand. I read the Stand first and this seemed reminiscent. However there is plenty of new ideas here to justify it. This was the first book I read from Robert McCammon and I've read all of his others since. The man has amazing talent, there are no doubts there."
5,must read!,I have gone through 2 copies of this book from reading it so many times! I've made most of my friends read it and not one person was able to put it down! Mr McCammon's writing enables you to visualize the characters in your mind as if in a movie. Absoulutely fabulous!
2,Horribly derivative of The Stand.,"If you're looking for a book in the same vein as Stephen King's infinitely better post-apocalyptic work of art The Stand, then Swan Song is an OK book. Is it a blatant ripoff of The Stand? Heck yeah, there's no denying that(the author himself admits it). It's just not a very good ripoff. I was left feeling empty at the end, whereas when the STand ended I was mortified to have to leave the characters I'd spent so much time with. When Swan Song ended I was thrilled that I could move on to a real book."
5,"I thought nuclear war would be a good wakeup for humanity,","so I, at the recommendation of several friends, finallystarted reading Swan Song. As in most of his otherbooks, McCammon takes awhile to get going. I think it took me almost 2 months to get halfway through, but the second half I finished in roughly a week and a half (at MOST). I still thought the war would be cool, and then slowly as the characters suffer through nuclear winter and post-apocalyptic anarchy, I involuntarily faded down to thinking it wasn't such a good idea anymore. No matter what else changed for me through the course of the book though, Roland still ROCKS."
4,I ate it up...,"Seriously, I couldn't put it down... this book even invaded my dreams for the duration...What I liked:The characters were well written and very real.The story is big, long and complex with a few unexpected turns.The writer moves from one character's point of view to the next effortlessly and always very smoothly. I've never read an author able to do that so well, and it made the story move along without getting monotonous.What I liked less:It's not really Science-Fiction. It's more like a Fantasy novel.There are some things that weren't very realistic to me, like I seriously believe canned food would run out way before 7 years went by... But I guess I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good story...good stuff..."
5,Best book McCammon's ever done,"I'd read a few of McCammon's other books (Gone South, Boys Life) and really didn't get into them as much as I did this one. It's a great survival story and still frightening long after the Cold War has ended."
3,Dated - needs to have been read in the 1980s...,"Many good movies and books don't wear well over time. I am finding this to be formulaic. This is due, at least in part, to having been mimicked over the years. I'm halfway through it now and am having a hard time finishing it.This is surprising, given the number of reviews and high ratings."
5,TOUCHES YOUR SOUL,"As I skim down through the reviews time and time again I see ""can't stop thinking about it"" and "" best book of all time"". Well it's true. I read this book the first time about many years ago. I never forgot it. I have reread it twice since then and it is part of me. When my son was old enough to understand it, I gave it to him...I didn't hardly see him for days until he was finished. It made a profound impact on him. He is an avid reader and his favorite book to date. There are some books that come close...but none that goes beyond Swan Song."
4,Apocalypse of huge proportions,"This was a good read if you out to enjoy a book that gives a way out idea of how the human race might react to the break down of all rules, and we were left to decide our own fate. It show that as per usual the human race is its own worst enemy. Some great characters and some unusual bad guys worth a read but a large long read."
5,"A true page turner, a must read for all who enjoy epic tales","A truly astounding book by one of my favorite authors. The characters are vivid, whether they're despicable or lovable. The story is well put together, so that there are very few, if any, slow or boring points. In contrast to the much publicized ""The Stand"", this end of the world saga is much darker and harsher, but no less entertaining. The descriptive nature of the Nuclear Winter slams you in the chest over and over again and will have you asking yourself if you would have the strength to survive it. Bottom line is: You'll laugh, you'll cuss, and you may even shed a tear or two along the way, but you will sincerely love this book."
1,"Occult and mysticism abound, waiting for faith","The story is filled with occultism and mysticism, and that is a subject I avoid whenever possible. if I had known this book was so heavily reliant upon those themes, I would have avoided it as well.I lost interest in the characters long before the half-way point, no real 'redemptive' characters so far, and the story is too dark (and unbelievable) for me complete.""In New York City, Sister Creep begins to walk around the remains of a New York ravaged by radioactive thunderstorms and tornadoes. While walking around, she finds a glass ring with jewels encased in the glass. Seeing it, she picks it up, believing it is important. She is surprised to see an undamaged building. Entering, she meets ""The Man With The Scarlet Eye"". She runs away and the building collapses. Sister is soon met by other survivors. They make their way through the hazardous Holland Tunnel, eventually scrabbling their way to New Jersey."" -Wikipedia"
5,Favorite book,Swan Song is the only book that I could not put down. I stayed up all night reading this book.
5,Fine Old Timer Pocket Knife,"This is a fine general purpose pocket knife. Compact yet useful for most around the house purposes. The shipping and handling charge, however, was high--particularly as a perecentage of the cost of the knife."
2,Stainless steel blade NOT high carbon as advertised,My husband wanted a knife with a high carbon steel blade. I purchased this knife for him because it was advertised clearly as such. I received the knife and the package says stainless steel. Very disappointed!! Otherwise it is fine.
3,Not So Good. Dandruff and Grease.,"This might be a coincidence, but when I started using this shampoo, I got mild-to-moderate dandruff. I'm not saying the shampoo caused it because maybe it was my old shampoo that was stopping it. But at the least, this shampoo did not stop dandruff and I'm left with a 9/10ths full bottle that I'll never use again.Also, it didn't leave my hair feeling clean unless I washed, rinsed, and repeated. Once left it feeling greasy/slimy. Overall, not a good product."
1,Usually Watered Down,I've been using Crew for a very long time and was the first time I purchased it via Amazon. I noticed that it was usually watered down as typical Crew Shampoo doesn't move quickly when trying to get out of the container. I'm not sure if it was just a fluke but I'll stick to buying it at my barbershop where it's not usually watery. It's impossible to tell from looking at the container but I would certainly question this particular product on Amazon's authenticity (as expensive shampoos are often replicated and scammed).
2,Not impressed,"This shampoo doesn't smell very good. It's not a BAD smell, per se, but it's not a GOOD smell, either, which I hate to say it, is a large part of what makes a good shampoo good. It is cheap though."
5,Fab' Cookbook- Highly recommended,This is truely a wonderful cookbook. The recipies are simple yet delicious.
4,Good and easy cookbook,I bought this as a gift for someone who wants to learn Indian cooking. He loves it - it makes this style of cooking very accesible.
3,"After Eve's excitement, Adam is a little dull","I read Bryan Sykes' Seven Daughters of Eve several times and found it very interesting every time. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Adam's Curse. The comparisons to how fish and other creatures reproduce are dull and I find it easy to put down the book in the middle of a chapture."
3,"Thought provoking, but. . .","I greatly enjoyed The Seven Daughters of Eve, and Adam's Curse had some memorable moments as well. But in the latter, I wondered how such a competent scientist could stray so far from science. Bryan Sykes is a marvelous story teller and I enjoy his train rides and personal anecdotes. I read such books as much for enjoyment as for knowledge. But in this book he seems to be making suppositions that are not backed by anything close to fact. By the time I got to chapter twenty-one, I was wondering what kind of mushrooms Bryan had been eating. Still, I will buy his next book. Adam's Curse was at least thought provoking."
5,"Reliable, accurate, no dongle!","I have had this mouse for a month now and have experienced no problems with it. It is comfortable to use, and I have been impressed with its tracking accuracy.The on/off switch is useful (when I remember) but the mouse goes into a power-saving mode anyway after a while. The resume time is short enough to not be a pain.The best feature of the mouse is that it uses Bluetooth to link with my laptop (Dell Inspiron E1405), so no dongle is required. The range is well over 15 ft and the connection is stable.Wholeheartedly recommended."
4,Good mouse for Powerbook,"This mouse worked right out of the box with my Powerbook. I had never set up a Bluetooth connection before, but it was quick and easy to do in System Preferences. Pointing is precise, and the scroll wheel works great. The default setting was too fast for me, and even after adjusting the pointer speed in the Keyboard & Mouse preference panel, the acceleration is a lot different than the old HP travel mouse I was using. I am getting used to it, though, so I don't think it's a problem. When I wake my Powerbook from sleep, it does take a few seconds for the mouse to reconnect, but I think I can get used to that, too. The color is darker than the Powerbook's aluminum case, but it matches well. The mouse feels great in the hand, and I'm happy to free up one my USB ports again. The power switch on the bottom will be nice when I toss it in my bag so I won't have to worry about battery drain."
1,Doesn't connect,Unfortunately the Windows operating sytem expects a bluetooth USB dongle to work with a bluetooth mouse and when you try and use an internal bluetooth receiver- it doesn't work.
1,A Little Erratic,"I set up the bluetooth on two Apple Powerbooks G4 ""17"" one being the NEW MacBook Pro. Works 'ok' on the older powerbook somewhat 'erratic' though. The new one IS ACTING non-discoverable! no matter how many configs. lol looks nice as a paper weight."
5,Best Mouse,"This mouse is great becuase there is nothing sticking out of your computer becuase it is bluetooth. The only real flaw is that when you have not touched the PC or mouse in a while it takes 2-3 seconds to return to being active. This is the best mouse for a bluetooth laptop, but the price on Amazon is a bit high."
2,Works great when it works,May work for a while but then totally flakes out. Then it takes several reboots and messing with it to get it to connect again. I went back to my USB fob mouse.
1,Missing a Part,"Device arrived w/o the plate that enables a weight to be attached to the rope. Don't bother trying to first get help from the manufacturer as Amazon.Com advised when I reported the problem to them. GoFit's website doesn't include an 800 number nor any way to contact them via the Internet. The device arrived w/o any manual, parts list, instructions or any information on how to contact them if you had a problem or question."
4,Such a funny toy,"It has testicles. Yup. When I was looking up images of this guy I thought they would transform into part of his robot legs or something but no, they basically just get put off on his sides to reveal his allegiance symbol. That's right, his Maximal symbol is on one of his testicles. Other than that, they are just meant to be robotic testicles. Funny huh?The alarm clock mechanism works fine. It takes one AAA battery. The instructions on how to set it are, of course, in Japanese. But it's a simple knob-turning mechanism like many classic alarm clocks. It should be fine for anyone to figure out with half a brain. He needs to be in robot mode for it to work because you lift his robot head up to set the alarm and push it down to shut it off. I sort of keep him half transformed so his head is revealed but he still sits on his tanuki legs.Long live the beast era!"
4,Lady fingers,"I consider the Alessi Savoiadi lady fingers to be a good value with great taste, very low fat, and a long (9 mo.) shelf life. I liked the last batch better as they were more crisp."
2,Historical,I read through the introduction and a bit of the chapters before I couldn't read anymore. I'm not a very linear thinker and this book is very linear and intellectual. Every story is put into a category and are very short. I wanted more detailed stories. I wanted more non-linear stories-- the ones that connect because of a little detail or a person (similar to Greek and Roman myths).
2,"Horrible, Expensive Textbook","I cannot fathom why this textbook is used to teach students about Information Systems Technology. The format is bothersome and information contained within the book is inaccurate.The author describes MIPS as the overall speed of a computer. This is erroneous. MIPS is a measurement of raw processor power, and the overall speed of a PC is not measured in MIPS.It has tacky business examples. In fact, it is business heavy but lacks updated business techniques and lacks in relevant examples.The writer needs to do his fact checking. Does he even work in the IT Industry?"
5,Perfect for pet food,"This is just the perfect container. It has wheels, it opens and stays open easily (for humans that is), is airtight and holds so much food. Now I buy my huge bag of cat food and just throw it in the container very easily. It's a lot smaller than you would imagine, but holds so much. Definitely buy this if you buy your food in bulk. Works perfectly."
5,Perfect container for dog food,"I bought this item to store dog food. It holds a full bag a food, it's easy to open and close, and being on wheels makes it easy to move around in the laundry room. It is air tight and closes securely. I love it."
3,Not airtight,"Great price. Decent container but is definitely not airtight. Gasket is made of cheap styrofoam. The wheels is optional, which is nice. Would be a great container if it was actually airtight."
1,Not Happy With Customer Service,"I ordered the Iris 30-qt food storage container with casters. What I received was a bird seed dispenser. I realize mistakes happen so I returned it the same day in the original box along with a copy of my order for the storage container. Instead of sending the right product, I received an e-mail saying they were refunding my credit card. No explanation for why they weren't sending the container, no apology. And I'm ripped off for the return postage of a little over eight dollars. I subsequently ordered an almost identical item on Amazon from another company and am pleased with it. P.S. It was cheaper, too!"
4,Cute and fun,"It isn't as easy as it looks but is a lot of fun and great for decorating cakes, cookies,etc."
1,Not a good experience with this product!,"I am sure there is a valid reason why this product is so expensive but my experience with it was horrible. This is one of the hardest products to work with, it's hard and can get messy, if your hair is too wet you will have chunks of fiber stuck to your hair, if it's too dry well good luck! All is all didn't work for me at all!"
3,The Incredible Shrink,"I realize the product description clearly states that it is 3 oz however it is odd that CREW makes this product in both a 3 oz and a 3.53 oz and that both are in the same size container. Make sure if you are price shopping that you realize which one you are buying. Other than this simple mistake, this product still provides me the best style of a medium hold with a matte finish."
4,Good for it's claimed use,"Bottom line: Crew fiber prevents your hair from looking like a fluffy kitten and it smells much better than a kitten, but the hold doesn't last all day.Your hair will have a dry look after application; the fiber product does not provide a shine. If you apply the product while your hair is slightly wet then it will not hold spiked hair. I recommend you shower, dry with a towel, then wait 5-10 minutes before application.The product has a masculine scent, but it's not overly bold. Mid 20 year old American and European women love the smell from my experiences.Due to the difficulty of figuring out the right wetness when applying, and the fact that the product does not hold for my long work hours (12+ hours), I feel that it does not deserve 5 stars for the price paid. I will likely purchase this again because it works decently, but believe it can be slightly improved upon."
5,Best hair cream/gel I have ever used,This product is the best known hair styling product I have ever used. It gives the hair a good hold for a long time without making the hair look too shiny. The hair looks great with matte finish. Most gels available in the market make the hair looks too shiny. Highly recommend to anyone.
2,bad smell,"works as advertised but a weird chemical smell to me, gives me a headache, can't use it, - so check it out in a store before buying to make sure you are ok with the smell. Going back to forking it over for aveda.... The yellow grooming clay (actually wax-y) from American crew smells pretty good and is a viable cheaper alternative to aveda"
3,"Good, But Not The Best","I've been a Janis Ian fan since her ""Society's Child"" days. This is a good showcase of her talent, but it doesn't equal the brillance of ""Between the Lines"". (I honestly don't think anything can.) This is a good sampler, but if you want Janis at her best, go with ""Between the Lines""."
3,english learner,I've bought this book because I've read another book of the same writer and found it very interesting and usefull to improve my english.
5,Firewall Grommet,"The Grommet worked fairly well for me. I used an Irwin Instabit to drill through the firewall. I think believe the actual diameter you need is 0.8"". It secures very tightly and the cap part of the grommet tightens down on the wire to prevent any water from dripping in. It has a very nice design. I would recommend to any one who does not want to use sealant or who wants a professional look."
4,Far Cry one of the better fps',"For those who will read most reviews on this page, don't listen to them. This game is awesome. The Graphics are some of the best i've seen. Now I have to agree the AI is not the best and there is a long unskippable trailer every time you load a game, but these things are easy to pass up when you think about how much fun the game is. I really think this game is worth it's money ($15 used or $20 new). I also love the weaponry and controls. Any one who likes first person shooters should definitely pick this up.Rating:Graphics:10Sound:9Gameplay:9Replayability:7Fun:9.5Origionality:5.5Difficulty:Pretty easy until the last levels.I love this game and would Highly recommend it to any fps fanboy."
4,Found a glitch!,"I got down to the very last ojective of the last level and found no boss to fight in the compound! So I ended up having to replay the last level and the second time I got to the same point, there he was! Overall a very good game and much harder overall than Doom 3. Surprisingly, the hardest part of the game were not any of the boss fights but entering the fortress in the last level."
1,Don't bother waste your money,"Despite amazing graphics, this game has a really stupid story and its very linear. I just find it boring. Just save your money and buy America's Army."
1,Couldn't afford to send it back!,This was supposed to be a NEW book. All the pages were stuck together on the bottom of the book and when I got them apart you can see a huge water stain. This was the first time I had ordered from Amazon and I will never do it again!!!!!
1,"Disappointed!! It's all Pink, not rainbow!","I am very disappointed, I bought this popcorn for my sons Dr Seuss themed 1st birthday. I assumed it was rainbow colored. There is NOTHING in the description about it being just pink. Now there's no time to order new..."
4,Not bad for a low budget film,After their daughter is murdered a couple move into an isolated cabin to get away from the city. The problem is that the cabin is haunted. Some of the acting is questionable and the script didn't always flow but for a low budget film it was okay. The woman playing the mother was too young for the part but did an adequate job.
3,Not as extensive as I thought it'd be...,"This book includes a short history of the chile pepper, 4 pages of color photos, and about 180 recipes. It doesn't include much about growing peppers or explain their basic uses (other than as part of recipes). While it includes a few pages of color photos, all other photos in the book are black and white.The history of the pepper, while sometimes interesting, wasn't as inclusive as I thought it would be. Basically, it explains how the pepper moved from area to area and how the local people grew it and used it in their cooking. According to the authors, the American chili pepper is the ancestor of the spicy dishes from Thailand, China, and elsewhere."
1,All that jazz,"Nowhere in the product description does it say that this book excludes nearly ALL jazz 45s, which makes it worthless to me. And we're not even talking about obscure artists. Ellington? Miles Davis? Fats Waller? Not there. Happily, I only paid $2 for a used edition."
2,Customer service really is atrocious,"I purchased a Nomad about a month ago. Both the software on the CD and the unit itself were faulty. No one answers Creative's non-toll-free phones, and email responses are not well thought-out and take 4 days each. After weeks of going back and forth, they finally accept that it is defective and are willing to provide me with an ""RMA number"" after I provide more information (an RMA number is required in order to return something with Creative --I have already registered and provided them with all the information twice) They suggest that it would be quicker if I returned the Nomad to the place where I purchased it, but because of their slow support, my 30 day warranty is now expired. I really don't expect to be using my Nomad for at least another month. The Nomad looks really great, and I'm still excited to try it, but Creative's customer support is perhaps the worst I've ever experienced."
3,"And one more time, Exposé","Another bland installment of an Expose greatest hits CD. This is now the 3d in a line of rather poorly put together Greatest Hits packages for Exposé. If you are looking for something new, you won't find it here. Arista has chosen to package this CD with a picture of the lineup of the best known girls of Exposé, probably in hopes of selling a few more units of this CD, now that Gioia Bruno, one of the most recognised members, has just kicked off a major solo career. For the completist, this is necessary, but if you are looking for someting to spark that old feeling you got when listening to Exposé, pass this on by and check out GioiaBruno.com. This one is Going, Going, GONE!"
5,A great performance by a great pianist,"If you ask me - they ought to put Pascal Roge in the series of ""Great Pianists of the 20th century"". His recordings of Debussy, Ravel and Satie's piano music are among the best I know for these composers, if not the very best. Roge's tender touch is especially good for their dreamy, hovering style. Indeed, in pieces like ""l'Isle Joyeuse"" I prefer Horowitz's powerful dynamism, and Roge sounds a little pale - but these are the exceptions, not the rule. His performance of the ""Reverie"" - in my view Debussy's best work and one of the masterpieces of piano music in all times - is touching, exciting, lovely; and so is the ""Clair de lune"" and many other pieces. Most recommended."
2,Too mechanical with little nuance,"The playing is technically flawless, but Mr. Roge does not seem to grasp the subtle nuance necessary to bring out the genius in Debussy. For example, very rarely is it necessary or even desirable to hammer out the low notes in this music, especially in the Preludes, but Mr. Roge seems to take a heavy handed approach when a light touch is in order. Check out the recordings by Paul Jacobs if you want to hear the inner beauty of the Preludes and the Images sets. Aldo Ciccolini offers a great example of how to bring out the line and expression of the some of the early works. I would not recommend this recording for anyone other than a collector who wants to realize how truly remarkable Paul Jacobs is as an interpreter of Debussy."
5,One of the best Debussy performances I've heard.,"There's obviously hundreds of options if you're just ""looking for some Debussy"", but keep in mind that the $3 CDs at Best Buy are $3 for a reason: They don't put any money into the production. It's near impossible to enjoy such amazing works as this if it's being recorded on a cheap microphone across the room from an amateur clanking away on an upright piano!Great recording, great performances. I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about with the ""volume problems"", this CD is actually mastered a little bit louder than most of the genre."
3,Good for kids,This camcorder needs to much light for indoor recording. The pictures are OK with the flash. I will spend a bit more money for a better lux rating on a multipurpose camcorder next time.
4,If only it didn't have Vista as the O/S,"Remarkable piece of hardware and at a very good price. WOuld have been five stars had I been able to get it with XP Pro instead of Vista.Unfortunately,I am too old to learn yet another O/S, so I've had to waste days figuring out how to ""un-Vista"" it and make it more akin to XP. I even bought it a copy of XP PRO (full retail version) and I intend to revert to XP PRO as soon as it arrives.Excellent machine tho. Superior to the Dells and Winbooks that I've been buying."
4,An excellent showing from Tim Smooth.,"Tim Smooth made the comeback on this cd I have been waiting for. His 98' album wasn't as good as I expected but he pulled through on this one. In my eyes the best track on this cd is ""Gotsta Get Paid"" because it shows Tim Smooth's real talent. His tongue twisting talents on this cd are among the best. If you enjoyed his 1st cd then you should defintely think about purchasing this one."
4,Thumbs Up!!,"We just received this a few days ago, and my kids love it!!! I have 4 kids, and its hard to find snacks that seem to please everyone, but this seems to do the trick. The only complaint I have as a parent is they are a bit sticky, but thats an easy fix."
5,Loved it!,"This is just another example of why Ryan is one of my favorite authors. Original plot, fleshed out characters, snappy dialogue and spicy romance make this one yet another keeper. Brava!"
3,Slow,prossing was slow took them five days to prosse's the order.But I got what I asked for so all in all not too bad.
5,Reference to Mathematics,Great source to brush up on math skills. Easy to use with high school students and parents trying to help them. Locating math topics easy.
1,The question is what do they rule,"I listened and found this dvd lacked any type of enthusiasm. I believe the band will be better if they got rid of natalie, her performance on this video was weak and for the ringo starr of the dixie chicks. She is lucky that the rest of the band makes up for her lack of talent.The approach to this video was one where ego trumped talent, knowing that it will sell no matter what was on it.I played once and dumped it"
5,It rules.,"OK, I own many dreamcast games ( Toy Commander, Trickstyle, Sonic Adventure, Sega Bass Fishing, Power Stone, Soul Calibur, Marvel vs. Capcom, and NFL 2K) and NONE of them are as good as this. Toy Commander excels in graphics, sound, control, replay, and gamepolay unlike any other. A TRUELY great game."
3,Thoroughbred #67,"Well, first I'd like to point out I'm a horse expert, and know all about this stuff. But a halter with REINS?? And did anyone notice that when Star is being ridden there's no GIRTH?? Really, the covers are starting to get BAD. Please, get a better cover will you?Also, again in this story Christina is BRATTY. She always is. I mean, I own a horse and a bazillion people ride her and I think that's great. But Christina can't bear it! Seriously, I'm losing intrest in this series."
3,Not the best of Higgins but still quite enjoyable,Although the subject is'nt that original and the plot seems to be at times far fetched and not very beliveable the story is still quite enjoyable.PS. The Finnish SS-men who appear in the book were in reality discharged from the Waffen-SS in Spring 1943 and not in 1945 but I understand that Patterson/Higgins had to bend the facts a bit to include the Finns in the book.
2,Not one of his best.,"Jack Higgins (aka Harry Patterson) usually writes interesting, albeit fantastic yarns. However, he suffers from empty characters and unbelievable situations more at home in a sci-fi novel. This is no exception; the characters are as empty as a crushed beer can, the plots fantastic and unsubstantiated and the action, infantile to say the best. His infatuation over teutonic heroes is rather sick. Something to read on a flight if theres not anything else."
2,nothing works,"honestly people need to stop making stuff that doesnt work. just waste of time, money and hope for me"
1,Dull and depressing,"The first few chapters of this book were encouraging, but somewhere in the middle the story just fell apart. I was expecting Ilana's life to unfold into a tale of adventure consistent with her youthful ambition, but as soon as she moves to the city, she loses all her spark and likeability and becomes a closed-minded old hag.Her daughters and their daughters are not much better. Their characters are boring, one-dimensional, and unlikeable. There is nothing interesting about their life stories or the depressing tenement in which they live.I forced myself to finish the book, hoping that one or more of them would get a life sooner or later and the energy of the earlier chapters would reappear. It never did."
4,Appealing and Involving,"This was a book that certainly kept my interest. The whole concept of The Tradition and its affect on the inhabitants of the Five Hundred Kingdoms was both unique and involving. The romance, however, I felt budded a bit too quickly to make it believable, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book non-the-less."
3,"Yep, this is a fairy tale...","I liked it at first and it's original spin on fairy tales. The concept was interesting. The real problem I had with it was the fact that (mini-SPOILER) the main male character is such a macho jerk and then he suddenly has a change of heart with the help of guess what!-a water sprite-and goes around prancing and all chivalrous and they live happily ever after.I'm not laughing. It's hardly believable and there really isn't a single redeeming point to the male character. I love the concept but I hate the romance, esp. the male character (in case you haven't figured it out yet) which kills the rest of the story."
2,Fell Flat.,"As a huge fan of Mercedes Lackey, I waited for months for 'The Fairy Godmother' to be released and was the first to loan it from my library...I'm so glad I didn't waste money on this piece of junk.The first few pages into the book left me completely frustrated. The tone of the book was already ruined with awkward, juvenile writing and description. It got worse as the story progressed. The characters were basic fiction fodder. Emotionally gripping? I felt no emotion except frustration and had to fight back the urge to throw the book across the room. I truly believe that this book was ghost written by an amateur trying to mimic Lackey's writing style while failing miserably.The concept behind the Tradition and how it was a driving force to push characters to fall into storybook legends was an interesting one. I kept being reminded of SHREK with all the fairytale references.Entirely disappointed in ""Lackey's"" latest title."
3,Annoying Typos,"I got this book from the library and it's pretty good, but I found something like 10 typos in it. They can really interrupt the story's flow. Don't think I'll be buying too many of this publisher's books."
3,The Set Up (Rating 3.5),"I don't recap what the book was about. You can read the blurb and other reviews for that. My favorite author recommended this series to me. I enjoyed this book, but there was a lot of set up. The story didn't really get going until about two thirds of the way through the book. I can tell this is going to be a great series that I'll enjoy, just brace yourself for the setup."
2,Not Really What I Was Expecting...,"I bought all the NM (at least up that point) cds at once and listened to them in order. I listened to this one a few times, but it wasnt really compelling to me upon repeated listens.I like to keep an open mind, and i do enjoy lots of different kinds of music. This is pretty much basic black metal that you could hear from any hundreds of bands. Nokturnal Mortum have much more talent than those other bands, so why they decided to be just like them with this album just boggles my mind.If true black metal is what you really really love, then you'll probably dig this. I would personally recommend Goat Horns, Lunar Poetry and if you can find it Weltanschauung."
2,"dry, predictable advice","After my friend and I watched the movie ""The Piano"" while we were in medical school, he said to me -- I don't get why this story was worth telling (or something to that effect). Same analysis can be made here. Carville and Begala have made a living at making loud, spun remarks and the writing in this book lacks warmth, their attempt at humor is poor in taste, and their advice is wholly predictable."
4,Certainly Entertaining,"This book is a quick read and I think most of the principles are at least intuitively valid. While their Southern folksy charm can be very grating to the eyes at times, Carville and Begala know how to coin a phrase and deliver it with a smirk. Time will tell as to whether their success with the Clintons was actually due to the application of their own principles or whether it was just an accident of the times."
3,Not as creative as I thought.,"I don't use this very often. Don't know what I was expecting, but I haven't managed one logo out of it. Not bad software, just not very useful."
1,Worst Logo Software on the market!,This software program for creating your own custom logo is HORRIBLE!! It is absolutely NOT user friendly and very difficult to use.
3,Urine off a better product for cat urine.,"Tried this for neutralizing cat urine stains and while it was fairly effective, I found ""Urine Off"" to be a more effective (though a bit more expensive) product."
4,Recommended by my vet.,I used to use natures miracle before I started using this and I have to say I like the smell of this better and it leaves less residue too. Using this with some extra advice from my vet and its been a couple weeks since there's been an accident in my house.
5,Amazing product- you will not be disappointed,This stuff is amazing at consuming cat urine. I used it on leather furniture and after 2 applications the furniture had NO smell at all - even during hot summer temperatures.
3,cat urine deodorizer,Have 21 cats. Bought this product because of other reviews. Works okay. Pricey. Have found other products that are cheaper and work better.
3,Natural Li Hing Mui where are you,"No one seems to mention that this stuff isn't even made from any natural ingredients. The stuff on Hawaii is natural, at least the Li Hing Mui powder I saw in some of the stores there. This stuff here is about as good for you as MSG."
3,Works well,"Product fully as described, easy to use and easy to peel off and place elsewhere....great value for money, has added plenty of colour to young boy's room."
4,Spider man stick on,I got these for my grandson for Christmas. He has stuck them on everyting over and over. He has really enjoyed them. They leave no marks behind and peel on and off easily. My grandson is 2 and he decorated his room with them all by his self.
5,Great to go with the big Spidey,"My son got the big Spidey and this bunch to go along with it. They work well with the big one, but I probably wouldn't just want these."
1,boringgggggggg,"Mike eats his own tail creating another soulless new age stuff.sorry,i am going to listen Ommadawn not this one."
5,best product,we have 5 year old twins when there gator died you would have thoght it was the end of the world. i went to amazon.com got the same exact battery had it shipped in two days havent heard a word about it since they are still driving.
5,BATTERY CAUSES FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS BATTERY JUST SHORTED OUT AND CAUSED A MAJOR FIRE. IT PROPELLED ITS SELF INTO GARBAGE CANS ABOUT 25 FT. AWAY, BURNING DOWN PART OF OUR FENCE AND PART OF OUR HOUSE CAUGHT FIRE. LUCKILY ENOUGH A NEIGHBOR SAW THE FIRE AND PUT IT OUT IN TIME. THERE WAS MINIMAL DAMAGE TO THE HOUSE BUT 2 SECTIONS OF THE FENCE NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE JEEP AND THE 2 GARBAGE CANS MELTED DOWN INTO ONE BIG BLOB-CAUSING A LITTLE GIRL TO CRY! DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!!BE AWARE, AND REMOVE THE BATTERY WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED!!"
1,Battery didn't work after charging,"I charged this item for my son, it showed it was charged, but didn't work when I connected it to his Peg Perego Gator. I couldnt find a link to return battery because Amazon considers is a hazard to ship a battery. I was very frustrated by this!"
4,first was dead,"I HAVE 2 OF THESE BATTERIES.WE DIDN'T REALIZE THE FIRST WAS DEAD IN 1 CELL OF THE ""TWINS UNDER THE COVER"" UNTILL I BOUGHT A SECOND BATTERY.THIS ONE IS FULL OF ENERGY THAT IS WEARING THE TIRES OUT BY DOING POWERSLIDES. THE NEW BATTERY GETS 4 STARS BECAUSE I KEEP IT MAINTAINED WITH THENOCO G1100 NOCO Genius Gray 6V and 12V 1100mA (1.1A) Fully Automatic Battery Charger and MaintainerSMART CHARGER WHICH ROCKS."
2,Biased and needs citations,"I was hoping for a history, not a summary of the Bible. I am a theology student, not a Christian. I'm still reading it, but I was hoping for more citations. In Ferguson's defense, I know from my other research that he is making correct conclusions (sometimes), but it NEEDS MORE CITATIONS. Even making simplistic statements like, ""There were already a large number of Christians in Rome by this time,"" I want to know where he got that information. I'm sure it came from some sort of census, but I want to know. This seems like a poorly researched, biased, under-cited waste of money. But if you're a Christian that only likes reading what you believe and not challenging yourself, by all means, it's a great read."
1,Merlin Is Coming,"MerlinBy:Jane YolenThis book is the third book in the Merlin Trilogy, there are two other book. This novel covers Melin's childhood. In the time of the 500's it is set in a dark forest in a meadow. Hawk Hobby as a child received a bird as a guide named Dolly. While trapped in the meadow he seemed to had many dreams throughout the long nights, that is how he got his name Dreamer. Rather than having Sir Ector as a guardian in the original story, he had a foster father that took care of him through his childhood in the book. It seems as if nothing may or could tear apart the friendship of Dolly and Merlin.In my opinion this book would be recommended for middle school and under. To me it wasn't that great of a book, but it was short and sweet. If you are looking for a book to learn about background information on Arthurian History this isn't a good book for that reason."
2,This is NOT a Casio product,"The description for this band lists the manufacturer as ""Casio"", it is not. The band is thin and chintzy. It barely fit around my wrist. It buckled in the last hole."
3,"Its OK, after alteration","I wear a ""throw-down"" watch - relatively inexpensive, and when it is no longer functional, I throw it away and buy an identical replacement - a Casio Data Bank. The watch has all the features I want. About once a year, I need to replace the band, and usually get it at Wal-Mart. When I saw this band on Amazon - good price, said to fit the Data Bank watch, I ordered it.The band did not fit - it was too wide (and the pins, consequently, too long). Fortunately, my wife is handy with the Exacto knife. She trimmed the band until it fit, using the old pins.The watch band itself is fine, comfortable, and holds the watch on my wrist. I just wish it had fit without surgery. Next year, it will probably be time to throw this watch away and order a new Casio Data Bank, which will come with a new watch band."
4,Excellent book to read for a small business,This is a fantastic book to help understand how to advertise in a local market and get the results you need. It's easy to read and has wonderful ideas.
5,If you aint down with this box set then S*ck it H*ll YA RIP,This box set has been a joy to own.A lot of memories in here for me.I should point out that this set should be updated With a 20th Anniversery Box set that should be out on DVD with all the Orginal 4-6 shows not this 3 hour cut out C*** that Vince and his guys have put together on these other vhs tapes and dvds. I can say that I have been to WRESTLEMANIA 19 & 20 they were awsome
3,Handle is NOT hollow for drill bit storage.,Item does NOT HAVE A HOLLOW HANDLE for drill bit storage. I would suggest going out to EBAY and searching for a Stanley Handyman drill #H1220 - much better quality.
2,Not Quite Enough,"The only complaint I have about this product is that it only measures the degrees in increments of five degrees. So it doesn't help very much unless you are trying to go N, S, E, or W... unless you're looking for a kiddie compass, this is not for you..."
3,Totem pole photo review,"Art of the Totem republishes archaelogical work done in the 1930's on Totem poles of the Northwest Coastal Indians. This short paperback is brief on text, but long on black and white and some color photos of Totem poles and other Native American art. Location maps of various totem pole sites are also included. This book contains many more photographs than equivalent length books on the subject, but does not contain much information on the various characters found in the Totem and their symbolism or history."
1,Live Crock of Bologna,"Thanks for the posted review about the Live Text ""Kit"" I was told to by for my course on Live Text. What a scam and after we students already pay a ""technology"" fee. I am revolting and will not buy in."
1,Won't work,"Purchased one of these and after it didn't work, I returned it to Amazon, which promptly sent me a new one. It also did not work. I tried both on a brand new PC, latest Sony Vegas and Cyberlink's Power Director, Sony blu ray player and a Panasonic DVD player - nothing recognized it."
2,Misleading / Limited Information,"The title and description did not indicate that it was an abridged and retold version. I am not interested in this. I was looking for the original text.Not only was the money wasted (30$ is outrageous for what it actually contains), but, I now have a book in my house which I would not have consciously brought in."
1,This movie is vile,"I bought this movie thinking that it was going to be good, but evidently I was wrong. This is the sort of film that makes you want to quit using your VCR."
2,Nice try,"Firstly, its my fault for buying a cheap speaker. You get what you pay for. One speaker was bad right out of the box. It made a distinct humming noise that was audible over the music. The louder the volume, the louder the humming. I bought four total, so far, three out of the four need to be replaced. They are crackling and buzzing. That was after one week of normal listening, and tring to break them in. Ill be spending my money on better speakers soon."
3,Ok for price but I should have brought fostgates,I was looking for new speakers for my blown ones in my 97 eclipse. These are ok don't expect to much bass out of them unless your running them on a amp. Surprisingly the highs are very very clear but what is lacking is the bass. I have a 300 watt sub in my car so that's where my main amount of bass is coming from but I wanted more of a surround sound in my car and they lack mid bass I wanted. Buy them if your on a budget and you need to replace your stock ones for the times being but don't expect boomy bass out of them. Save up for Pioneer's or Rockford Fostgate rull range speakers.
2,Nah...,"I shouldn't have been this cheap... do yourself a favor - stay away from these - no base, distorted sound.The only good thing I can think of after installing these - I am trained now, will buy and install better speakers fast and clean."
3,very good,"ok ,but not as a rich a sound as i thought would have. But works well for what i wanted,for price."
4,Sound fine.,"Put these in the front of a 1999 Ford Escort Wagon--didn't see that the clips were shipped with (but they were) so I ended up fastening them with some sheet metal screws.Sound is fine...not spectacular, but good enough."
1,Does NOT fit 96-98 Civic 4 door LX,"Even though Amazon checks to see if item is compatible with your ride (which it did), they are just WAY too big. I guess you could do some modification, but when I called to be sure, they told me they were exact size of stock speakers and would pop right in. DON'T BUT THEM FOR THIS CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Speakers were used,Very disappointing that the speakers were used even though they were represented as new. Mounting holes had scuffs from mounting screws and one of the speakers covers was broken.
4,"Excellent, don't listen to the 1 stars!!!","At first I was skeptical, reading the many awful reviews these speakers received.. But let me tell you how pleasenetly surprised I was.. They sound GREAT! I have a head unit with 50 watts a channel output.. So ya figure - 25 RMS... They bump just like they should.. Super clear vocals and great MIDS... With a small 4 channel amp I can only imagine they would sound even better.. For the price they are perfect. Even if you are just replacing them with a factory head unit, still the best for the price.. More exspensive, better grade speakers, will def with out a doubt out perform these, but in the same breath - THEY SHOULD. If you are looking for a high end speaker to hook up to a high end system - keep looking, but if you are looking for factory replacements, an upgrade from stock to a better head unit, than these are a great pick."
4,nice product,"good price,fit everywhere,fast delivery,nice package.. I have to modify to fit in my car,but it s work good.I wish it have a ready to cut same peaces to be more easy to fit."
4,recommend,"good sound for the cost, shipped right away. Came before I expected. If you like music I would recommend these."
2,sad,The speakers look nice but that's about it. You can't turn your sound up to loud or the speakers start to make a fuzz sound. If you are trying to get a decent system go pay for a better brand.
5,Very goodspeakers for the money,Replaced front speakers in my trooper and have been very happy with this purchase. Sound great has enough bass for me but if you need door vibrating bass these are not the ones. They fit perfect in old speaker factory cutouts
2,Only worth their low price,"I have a 2000 CR-V. These came with no instructions. New holes have to be made either in the speaker frame or the panel housing. To me the factory installed Pioneer speakers sounded better than these. I wouldn't have bothered, but after ten years one of the Pioneers was blown and from the other reviews I thought these would be good enough replacement. Not satisfied... Now I ordered the Alpine SPS-600. I feel like I am taking less of a risk."
4,Great replace from factory,"Installed in a 2002 Dodge Dakota crew cab. I bought two sets of the speakers and I think they're are great, but only acouple things that I dont like. First is the lows are not there at all. My factory speakers had WAYYYYY more bass then these do. And lastly, I had to slighty modify the back door speakers so I could roll the windows all the way down( A few 1/2in spacers did the trick just fine) But all in all I em greatly satified with the overall sound quality of them. For the bass problem, I installed a single 12in subs and hooked everything up to a 5ch amp and bass is no longer an issue. Even on my single din deck before the amp the Pyle speakers would sound off"
3,Hollow,"The speakers left a bit to be desired. The mids & highs are sharp but the bass is hollow. For the construction of the speaker and all the elements they put into it I would have expected deeper bass.The input response was weak as well. My 11 year old factory speakers responded better when the volume was increased.I'm not completely dissatisfied because the highs & mids are sharp, but would not recommend these for a rear speaker application where you typically get more bass."
1,Don't do it!!,"I purchased these 6x9s thinking it was a good deal. The highs blew after about 3 and half months. The other ""2 ways "" (mid,bass)of the speaker plays fine but only on low settings. It only was on a 200 watt amp. The cost to ship and return is costly and would be better spent towards a higher quality pair of speakers, I'm getting infinity or alpine for now on."
1,My deal was NEVER fulfilled.,"Move on to something else. Midway NEVER fulfilled my order... even after waiting more than a MONTH. I was really looking forward to the speakers too.Caveat emptor.PS: The speakers themselves reviewed great... check ""testfreaks"" online. Just get them somewhere else."
2,Pyle o' crap,Simply you get what you pay for. I figured I'd check out what I could get for cheap and sadly my stock speakers were better.
2,More bass and less treble in my car,"Compare to the 4 in. OEM speakers in a Mitsubishi Mirage, they have more bass but the sound now is not as clear as before. It seems that the Pyle speakers which are mounted on the front dashboard are having a subwoofer boxed effect. The OEM 4 inch speakers sounded a lot clearer.After two months, the small black fabric ring at the center of the speaker is detaching from the blue cone.They are not good combination with two 6.5 inch 2 way Sony speakers in the back of the car.12/1/2011 Updated: I put the original 4 inch speakers back and the music and vocal voice are much clearer."
4,Perfect for the price,"It's true these speakers don't offer the bass that a little bit higher end 6*9 will carry, but as someone with an independent woofer system these were absolutely perfect. I can't believe the quality for the price. All I was really looking for was a speaker with a high enough wattage that my pre-amp couldn't blow them out at high range. I got so much more than I expected, especially for this price.I'm sure the speakers aren't going to last a lifetime. The materials are sturdy, but look relatively thin. So I'm sure they'll deteriorate quickly over time. I wouldn't expect them to last more than a year or two. You can't really ask for more than that for 15 bucks a speaker though."
5,pyle 6x9,I bought these to replace the factory speakers in my door of my 2006 cobalt.. And for the price this was a good buy.. Only if ur replacing the speakers in your cobalt a universal mount will be needed.. Wish i had known this before hand. But i did go ahead and put them in my cobalt and i got a wall mount on the way.. They sound excellent over all.. Pyle is a good brand. My old car was a complete package of pyle and i loved them.. Hence the reason i bought more.
1,what a pyle!,"installed these in dash of 90 jeep wrangler, had them in about 1 week and already blew one of them. one still sounds good. they did sound good while they worked, but alas, they do not both still work. since i only paid like 20 bucks, i'm not going to go thru the heartache of paying to send back and to only do the same. i even used them for highes and mids only, not pushing any bass thru them, and still blew. i am about to invest a little more due to the fact i had to completely disassemble my jeep's dash to install, i'm not going to take a chance on that again. if i were you, i'd spend a little more and get a better speaker.....i'm gonna order the polk audio 4 x 6 speakers now, so.......thanks!"
1,not for people who want to crank it up,"these speakers are not for people who like loud music or plan on hearing their speakers over their subs. had these in for about 3 days, i hated them from day on because they crackled too much when the music is cranked all the way up but now they're blown and all they do is fart"
5,Don't let the price fool you!,"I bought these speakers for my 2007 Kia Spectra. They said they would fit, and they didn't. But we were able to make a few little adjustments (drill new holes in the metal door frame) to make it work. Don't let the price fool you. These sound great! My husband was acting like a teenager again after he installed them. The neighbors were watching him while he ""tested"" them out, cranking up the bass and the volume. They really did sound good, even seemed to make my original Kia speakers in the back sound better too. I like them so much....I just ordered another pair! A great deal, a great product! You won't be disappointed."
4,"good speaker, good price","i replaced the speakers in my motorcycle with a set of these. they are better than the original ones. i don't expect a home stereo quality sound on a motorcycle, but these speakers perform well."
4,Decent.,"Totally decent 4s for the money. There's no snake slither sound and they pump out great, clear trebble. They're nothing earth-shattering, but then again they are 4s for $20. I just needed them to replace some worn out ones in the back of my SUV and they serve that purpose wonderfully."
3,good for what they are,"inexpensive, decent for little speakers- its all that would fit in the front of my truck. about what i expected"
1,"Sorry, I am also not impressed as the others,","Another odd man out with my opinion. I purchase this product with high hopes. The drill has worked fine but the batteries went bad after about 16 months. Neither battery will accept a charge and now I am stuck trying to rationalize buying another battery. $100 for one battery or $260 for a new drill and two new batteries. Hold on, wait, wait, wait, this time from Harbor Freight. I will buy four plug in drills with extended three year warranty for that price. Then when one burns up I grab an other and exchange the burned up drill when time permits.I also have a 13 month old Hitachi Impact drill thats batteries are shot. I have over $600 wrapped up in power drills and not a battery that works.."
5,"Brilliant, Clever and Great Help","Pat Walsh has packed an incredible amount of information into a very funny,very clever,very readable, enjoyable book. I've read it twice. This is one funny editor. He may be the only funny editor.If you're a novelist, wanna-be novelist, or would just like to know what editors look for, read this book. You need this book. You won't find a better book about getting published. And finding one that makes you laugh out loud....? Not likely."
3,Exciting...?,"Criss cross is a very interesting and unquie book. It is not predicitable at all if your the type that enjoys trying to figure out what will happen next. In, my opinon it was an okay book but it was one of those selections where you read it one and then your done."
2,Not Such A Great Book,"The book I have been reading is Criss Cross by Lynne Rae Perkins. This book is basically realistic fiction because it is not entirely true, but can happen to someone or somebody.Criss Cross is about a girl named Debbie who just wishes for one good thing to happen to her. There's a boy named Hector who decides to take guitar lessons. He later on notices a girl named meadow who catches his eye. The mystery if both stories go well.My impression of the book wasn't as fascinating as I had for other book I've read. I wished it could have had a little more excitement. I would recommend this book to girls ages 10 and up."
1,hi people,"The book Criss Cross was an easy read. The book took place in New York in the wealthy area. Debbie was like a spoiled little kid. Debbie all ways wanted everyone to leave her alone but they never did. Finally when they left her alone she wanted people to be around her.I do not recommend the book to people because it was a boring book to read and because I did not like it. Some girls might want to read it because it is about a girl who is my age. I learned that if you wish for something it might come true, so be careful what you wish for."
2,A disappointment,"Perhaps it's just me, but I read a lot of books, both for young readers and adults, and I have had a very difficult time getting into this book. The writing seems forced, rather than lyrical. And I can certainly see why young readers would feel distanced from the main characters. I will keep trying but so far this is a disappointment, especially for a Newbery award."
1,"The cover says, ""She wished something would happen...""","Well, so did I. By the middle of the book, I gave up. Soooo boring! Nothing happened! It took the author way too long to get to anything resembling action, and while some would bill it as a 'gentle' coming of age story, it was too hard to find the story in it. Seriously, fifty pages to find out that Debbie likes to borrow her sister's nail polish and paint her toes? The characters were tenuously connected, at best, and there didn't seem to be a central plot or conflict. At least, if there was one, it was too well-hidden. The characters were generic, not easily distinguishable one from the other, and while I felt that she was trying to draw beauty out of the mundane I could have lived without pages describing how Debbie would curl up inside her sweatshirt. Seriously, don't waste your time."
4,Wonderful story,"What a contrast between a contemporary Newbery and an old Newbery! Where the main character in Smokey the Cowhorse has adventure after adventure, facing death over and over, the main characters in Criss Cross do almost nothing. The kids sit around and talk and sunbathe and listen to the radio and think. That's about it. It's Perkins' unique way of looking at the world that gives this book its surprising fun feel. And the pictures are great, too."
5,This was a great Movie .,I loved this movie so much that I had to have it. I even had met the actor in person Eddie Spears. I love hearing and seeing all the true native American stories come to life. The price was precise and the shiping also. Thanks so much.
4,Indian Legends and Dreams,this is a wonderful DVD giving an insight into the legends of the Native American peoples and also for young people of all races to learn to respect the older people and listen to them. If only the Australian Aborigines would share their beliefs in the same manner.
4,Beautiful movie,"I was showed this film in a Native American Literature course last semester. I myself have Native American ancestry but no one in my family has any grasp of our ancestors' traditions or way of life. I would highly recommend this movie to people who do not know much about Native traditions or stories. The stories say so much about life, but are often humorous at the same time. I love how the movie is multiple stories, all relating to the main plot. It definitely doesn't lose your attention, and I think children would enjoy it...although it may be confusing for kids around 6. I definitely want to get this movie and watch it with my 8 year old nephew. This is American history that they don't teach you in school..."
2,Somewhat helpful,"It was a helpful book but not one that I would be willing to keep in my library for a long period of time. It covers alot of basic things that most people do need to know but if you have been in a position of leadership for a long period of time, most of the things covered should have already been learned if the leader seeks to learn."
3,Review: Discovering Home with Laurie Smith,"Beautiful style and pictures typical of Laurie Smith, but I would have liked less of her personal home and more of what she has done on the show."
3,Popcorn bag,This size bag is good for fundraiser functions however the popcorn scoop that comes with the popcorn maker is hard to get into the bag because of the bag size. I just use a smaller scoop. I have noticed that some bags are not glued very well causing the bag to open at the bottom. Overall this is a good product. I would purchase it again.T. J. Mulhern
2,Popcorn bag,Actually it is too small to be able to shake the popcorn and distribute the seasoning that is sprinkled on top. I'd go for a larger size next time.
2,Too Small,"These bags were much smaller than I thought, and I thought they would have a ""squared-off"" bottom, instead of the ""V"" style, and that means you can't fit as much popcorn into what is already a small bag.We've used a few, but I'm now looking out for ones that are the right size and shape."
3,"Small, but it works...","The bags are small and will only hold enough for about 3-4 handfuls (honestly). Like other reviews, they don't hold much and won't stand on its own, even with popcorn inside."
1,Another bullpucky book,"Books like this one keep psychoanalysis in the realm of witch doctors. I idealize my continuously present, loving father, and I am an aetheist. My son has disowned me who divorced he and his mother when he was 19 and I then had marginal contact. My son is a born-again Bible believing fundamentalist Christian.Too, using Freud today is like looking to Newton to understand the string theory, maybe marginally helpful but basically way out of date from newer and real science."
5,A must read!,"We were surprised by 9/11 even though we should not have been. Let's not be surprised by a nuclear version that wipes an American (or Russian, or Israeli) city off the map -- and possibly creates a crisis that sparks complete destruction of our civilization, just as the assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo in 1914 set off World War I.Graham Allison knows his stuff and makes a strong argument for action to avert such a disaster. THIS IS A MUST READ!! If you are already in touch with the urgency of the situation and need a quick shot of hope, jump ahead to chapters 7 and 8 where Allison outlines what we need to do, and then go back and read the early parts."
5,A hit!,Got this for my daughter. She wanted to learn Hotel California. She was thrilled to get this with all the other songs. She went through right away and marked all the songs she wants to play. It was definitely a hit!
3,New twist on classic revenge story!,"This is one of those novels that sounds intriguing. When you begin the story you really are not sure where the story is headed. It becomes a voyeuristic look at the life of a young man who will stop at nothing in order to get revenge on a doctor, who begin as somewhat of a mentor. The young man, Syd Redding, goes from respect to plotting revenge after Dr. Kessler humiliates him. The idolized doctor goes from a well respected man who in the eyes of Syd, deteriorates into a controlling dispassionate individual with no regard for the feelings or lives of those that get in his way. Syd's plan for revenge teeters on the brink of failure unless he is willing to trade away some of the good things in life for the ultimate revenge. This novel at times becomes so intense that it is actually uncomfortable in parts and the need to put the book down is almost overwhelming!! Craig Holden puts a new twist on a classic revenge story!!"
4,All right,"The book was readable, and not as shocking or controversial as I was expecting. I got an amorphus message from it- I wasn't sure what the writer believed motivated his characters, and maybe that was the point- a lack of clarity and direction drives teens to destructive behavior."
2,Ehhhh....,"I was very excited to receive this book, but I wasn't really all that impressed after reading it. It had some interesting facts in it, and the storyline was something a 14 year old would write, so all in all, it was just okay. Wasn't really a waste of time to read, just a waste of money to purchase."
2,This books needs a REALITY check!,"I was going through a stressful period in my life (being a working mother of two toddlers), and I wanted something that can lift my spirit and give me back a sense of myself, I have to admit that it was a fun to read but the over all experience was disappointing and a waste of my money, I could not relate to many of her lessons, thought the exercises were silly, and her advises will only make my life more complicated. This book will not give you inspiration, empowerment or any new insights."
2,Unimpressive,"I thought this would be more than a ""You go, Girl!"" book of cheers. I was wrong. There might be a few passages that are encouraging to read, and thats valuable. However, I bought this and a few other books to expand my knowledge on the art of seduction and influence... my mistake."
5,Best Deal for a Multi-Purpose Oil,"I've used medicinal grade Lavender(Lavandula angustifolia) for years in a wide range of uses - caring for my skin, sleep, as well as its relaxing and calming effects. It's safe for use on children which I've applied on the bottoms of the feet and on skin irritations. It's the one oil I always make sure to have on hand and order regularly. The 2-ounce bottle is an excellent deal and lasts a very long time."
4,Lavenders,"This smells like real lavenders. I use it for everything. As a perfume, bug repellent, and house scenting. The scent is strong and true to lavender. I was very happy with the quality."
3,Nail Fungus,Really do not see that much improvement but was told it is a long process. This is bottle #3 when finished will stop using.
4,Lavender Oil,"The Lavender Oil arrived in a box with some books. While it was placed in a plastic bag, there was no protective plastic wrap around the cap, and the oil leaked a lot all over the box. Thankfully, the books (with no protective wrapping) were not affected other than they smelled really good. In another box I later received the Orange Oil, which had the plastic wrap around the cap, and it arrived in great shape. Both scents are pleasant but I have yet to use them."
1,Smell just wrong!,"I use lavender oil for relaxation and have been using aura cacia oil. I put a few drops in my diffuser and spreads on all my home and last very good.But with this oil, the smell its just not good, I dislike it very much and find that don't last long. I will use it to add to my laundry detergent but I cant recommend it. I wont buy it again."
3,not real lavender,I have purchased other lavender oils from other sources. This one does not smell pure lavender. It smells like it is adulterated with other scents. I am not satisfied with it as much as I am with the other brands.
4,decent oil,I bought this mainly to use in my laundry so my clothes will come out smelling nice. I use homemade detergent and fabric softener which have no scents so I add this. Only problem is I have to use many many drops (as many as 20) in the wash to get a decent scent on my laundry. Otherwise I love it.
2,Awful Smell (Bad batch?),"I have used Lavender Oil many times in the past, including NOW Foods lavender oil. I don't know what is wrong with this batch, but it does not smell pleasant or anything like the ones I have used in the past. It makes it difficult for me to even want to use this product."
5,Good Book for beginner,It is a nice book for beginner. It has provide lots of information related to the topics and the text is easy to read. It has lots of data and picture so that you will get a general understand of the topic. I recommand for someone who just start learning SOC.
1,Never arrived.,My book NEVER ARRIVED! How do I cancel payment??? This user stole my money and never sent me my book.
1,poop on a DVD,"In our world where people are starving to death as we speak, it's sad that some people got a bunch of money together and spent it on this piece of crap movie."
4,A movie to feel good about,"""Wondrous Oblivion"" is a movie about coming to terms with differences. We are all different, yet deep within, we are all alike. Powerful proof of this is the relation between the boy in the movie (a white Jewish kid living in a Jewish neighborhood in Britain, some time in the sixties) and the black man living next door (a Jamaican family man who recently moved in). Both share a love for cricket and the sport unites them in the middle of an odd circumstance, where the rest of the neighbors embark on a racist crusade against the newly arrived black family. The boy's family overcomes their initial prejudice and stand up firm for their neighbors and what's right, as they realize how much alike they all are, in spite of the difference in the color of their skins.Though there are a couple of moments that may not be the most appropriate for children under 13, the movie in general is a great lesson in tolerance and friendship for everyone in the family."
3,For what it was...,"I am very picky when it comes to Lesbian movies because I have been let down time after time. I do have to say that this movie is better then other's I've seen, the kissing scene was amazing, and the actresses were beautiful of course. With that said it was a bit unrealistic and a bit cliche. I was a bit disappointed because it could have been a great movie, but it was just OK. Watch it and judge for yourself, I always love to support lesbian films."
3,Fun to watch,"Nice movie to watch but not worth buying. It was a better finished product than Claire of the Moon, which Nicole Conn also filmed. Better acting, better film quality."
4,A Good film,"It always cracks me up how terribly pastors are portrayed in films. Throwing fits, yelling at his wife etc. The wife does take some risks, but I don't think the impact of the news was dramatic enough on her life. She's the pastors wife you would think that would create a stir within the town. As for the scene. A reviewer mentioned that it is the longest kissing scene in film history, this is true, is it the hottest? Storyline and buildup wise maybe, but there have been several kisses in other films people will never stop talking about. The film overall isn't bad at all. If you aren't open about others sexuality than ofcourse don't watch it. If you just want to watch a movie about love, then sure, pick this one up.Sabrina Fuster makes her movie debut, does a great job I think and very pretty too."
2,Elena was Undone--lost opportunity.,What undid her was a lousy script. Some decent acting talent lost in a confused overly complicated story with terrible dialog. All this superficial crap about the hypocrisy of the church and the dopey character who talks about love and the right person all of the time is just trite and diverts from what should have been the core of the story Elena and the true depth of the forces pushing and pulling on her. A lost opportunity.
2,liked bike at first,"I have had my bike for about 16 months now and it just started making this clunking noise when I peddle. This bike was great when I first got it and I loved it but now I will have to take it apart and see what is wrong with it. The clunking is on the left side and very pronounced like the peddle is almost stuck. Well as of yesterday 06/13/11, my left peddle just fell off the bike. After looking at the screw on the peddle it was not properly threaded which made it spin loose. I now have to replace the left peddle and hope the threads in the peddle bar are not stripped or I will have to replace that piece also."
4,sturdy,"This is a sturdy product -- works well, seat adjusts easily, silent operation. Only complaint: it always gives the message ""great job"" regardless of how long or hard you've been pedaling. That's kind of silly."
2,In Close Quarters,"Well unlike the other reviews, I found the main characters to be two of the most unappealing characters I've ever read about. I couldn't muster enthusiasm for either one of them. I felt the writer was trying too hard with the,""macho latin"" thing when it came to TJ. I hate to say it but, I found TJ to be written as a stereotype. How could Karin think that he was mispronouncing her name when he referred to her as, ""Cariño"", that got really old really fast. I finshed it but, it was painful."
5,"Fun, funny, old-school Irish pop","This is a great set of old-school Irish/Irish-American pop from 1921-51, with sentimental standards like ""Danny Boy"" lined up next to stereotype-laden novelty songs that are even more fun now than they were back in the good old days. Celtic folk purists might not like this stuff, but open-eared listeners will still get a great kick out of 'em. Recommended!"
2,"Poor pumps, decent coffee, disappointed overall","I'm on my 3rd unit. Basically, every unit I've tried, provides 2-3 oz. maximum with a pod; sometimes I only get 1 oz. I just hit the button until I get a proper cup, 7-8 oz. It works great w/o a pod loaded. Tech Support kind of acknowledged a pump problem but retracted quickly and blamed it on the priming.The coffees are decent tasting and not too expensive compared to other options.If you like HOT coffee, you'll be disappointed. Its ok but obviously balanced for a litigious society.Too bad the quality is so low, but its cheap comparatively so I'll live with it until I feel like paying +$350 for a real coffee machine from Saeco or Nespresso (Nestle).I assume no one else has posted these issues because they've returned it and forgot it."
1,Why I won't buy this coffee maker,"I do not own this coffeemaker and I refuse to buy it for the following reason, which is not made crystal clear by Melitta in its advertising: YOU HAVE TO BUY MELITTA COFFEE IN THE SPECIAL POD FILTER WHICH YOU CAN ONLY GET FROM MELITTA. I'm insulted by this ruse to sell coffee.I love one cup makers and have owned two Melitta one cup makers that used #1 filters and brewed directly into a mug (they don't make them anymore). I currently have a Black & Decker ""cup at a time"" that allows me to you use my coffee of choice, which is Gevalia. You better be sure you like Melitta coffee before buying this thing.How dare Melitta try to force me to buy their coffee, and their coffee only, if I want this one cup maker. I refuse to be manipulated in that way and I am very disappointed in Melitta for not putting a more versatile one cup maker on the market."
4,Unusual concept,"This was a very interesting concept for anyone who has a belief or interest in angels. Each song mentionsangels. Some are touching and some are humorous, like ""Angels With Harmonicas,"" and some are inspirational,as in ""We Are Each Other's Angels."" There is such a variety of musical styles and approaches in these two disks that you are bound to find many songs that you really like."
5,Sturdy shoes!,"Great comfy pair of shoes. I decided to stop buying cheapo shoes to save money and to save my feet. I also needed to buy shoes that I could wear with my orthodics. They fit in my Briggs nicely. They're kind of clunky and sort of a load to throw in a suitcase for a ""just in case"" occasion, but they're worth it if you want quality shoes. Mine has held up very nicely after a year. I sprayed mine with water repellant. My partner has a pair of Briggs that he just loves to death that are still holding up after a year also, but he wants another pair exactly the same anyway."
3,Interesting,"Although this book is full of cool stuff about mass psychology, with lots of examples to prove the points, it got a little dry and repetitive after awhile. Also, the price makes me want to puke. The cartoons added all over the place helped put a bit of life into the reading though."
3,good investor,"I study economics alot - almost daily with all the stuff I read, as I try to navigate my way to profits. I highly value Dine's strategies and thoughts, but haven't subscribed to his service yet, because he charges too much - basically stealing in my opinion (with all the subscriptions I assume he gets). I thought I'd read his book to learn more of his approach - it does help me understand. For exmample, there is a ""murmoration"" in gold stocks right now, and you should buy becasue the ""birds"" have lost their direction (stocks are tanking). You can hear James on King World News broadcast, and maybe Financial Sense Newshour (.com). Good luck to all who try to learn.From his book, I feel James is pretty nerdy, but he makes his place on my team. The book is a little tough to read completely because of James's intellectualism being overbearing."
2,STAY CLEAR,VERY POOR....IT ISN'T REALLY VERY USEFUL AT ALL...WON'T PICK UP DEBRIS ETC. AND THE MOST IRRITATING THING ABOUT THIS BADLY DESIGNED PRODUCT IS THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITH AN EXTENSION NOZZLE?! MY MISTAKE FOR NOT READING THE INCLUDED PARTS LIST BUT HOW USELESS DOES IT MAKE THIS VACUUM?....AND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL DUE TO THE ODD CONFIGURATION OF THE FILTER UNIT....NOT THE SHOP-VAC I WAS HOPING FOR.
4,Happy about available cosmetics from Amazon,"Received right away. Will be interesting to see how long it last. Seems dried up quite a bit; should have sent it back perhaps. At about $24, I am thinking that I should have bought locally where it might have been fresher and last longer. What I have used, however, is nice because it last all day, not flaking off onto my skin by evening's end! You do have to put it on fairly quickly because it dries quickly. So far, I like it!!"
2,Not sure,Very picky about what cd you use. It wants to format them and if you stop without finishing the disk you are hosed.
3,Not flexible enough for short runs,"I have generally found Belkin cables to be an excellent value. A high quality cable at a reasonable price. I have two of the 16 foot cables going to TV's that I am very happy with and would give FIVE stars, but trying to use the 4 foot to connect adjacent components just doesn't work very well. I ended up using a cheaper cable that was more flexible."
3,"Too feminine ""men's"" divers watch","This particular Seiko Diver watch is a reasonable timekeeper, is well constructed, holds good waterproofing, and its see-thru glassback has entertainment value. But I dont like its relatively small diameter, its thinness, and its too-narrow rubber strap. The glow of its markers are also weak and last short. It looks like a smallish mid-size diver watch or even a ladies' diver watch rather than a true men's diver. It is also too light in weight that it seems to be made of plastic rather than steel and glass. If only it were as heavy, wide, and thick as the steroid-pumped Seiko Black Monster, I would keep it. But for now, Im looking into giving this away -- to my sister or to a female friend."
5,Yoo need this,"New pastors, THIS IS A MUST!!!!! YOU NEED IT!!! This book will also prepare you for what seminary can't. Don't pass this book up.You may think you're on the ball, read this and you'll br ready to handle all the balls thrown at you."
4,interesting wanderings,"Terres, who was editor-in-chief at Audubon, spent a decade wandering the Mason Farm Biological Reserve in Chapel Hill, NC. The former farm was donated to the University of North Carolina to allow students to observe the wildlife there. Terres, likewise, set out to chronicle the life he found there, hiding in blinds, perching in tree stands, etc.. & he offers a wonderful account of his observations.He describes each of the seasons & then gives detailed descriptions of the lives and habits of some of the farms residents: flying squirrels, turkey vultures, wild turkeys, cottontail rabbits, and the like. He came to know some of these creatures individually, including a heroic black turkey and his own pet flying squirrel. He endows them with personality and character and, like him, we start rooting for them in their struggles to survive.GRADE: B+"
4,4 1/2 stars for excellent post-punk sounds.,"my favorite magazine, the british publication ""mojo,"" picked this as the fifth best album of 2006, right after bruce springsteen's ""we shall overcome."" and a fine recording this is. fresh and energetic, it brings to my mind the post-punk sounds of the early, early 80's. think of ""the cure,"" only with a more raw, edgier, harder rocking sound. there are slashing guitars and passionate vocals galore on this excellent release, which i highly recommend."
3,might not be what you think,"They say there's 15 puzzles for solo play, but it's the same game 15 ways."
5,A must for puzzle lovers,"Even on the Nintendo 3DS, this is one of my favorite games. The game is incredibly addictive and it can be so hard to quit! The techno music and backgrounds give this game a real nice touch so it won't look like a tedious puzzler. I recommend Planet Puzzle League for any DS owner, INCLUDING the 3DS."
3,"Can Anyone Say, ""Linkin Park?""","This band just rides the coat tails of Linkin Park. It Seems like ever since the former band came out, any white boy who thought they could rap met up with a white boy who could sing, and decided to form a band.Dont get me wrong. That's not so say that this band isnt any good. They are, just completely un-original. The only thing that really differentiated Dry Cell from Linkin Park is that the wrapped vocals are more angry and a little more harcore than their more popular contemporaries."
3,"Disappointed, too heavy!","I bought them because is great value and looks very useful. When I got them two of the bakewares were broke even with secured packaging. I didn't ask for return because I have to ship them back with my own cost and wait for them to ship another set to me is just too much hassel. The plate and bowls are pretty heavy, and I didn't expect. I am not a small person and I still need two hands to pick it up. The 4 small bowls are so small that I don't know what should I do with it."
5,Grandson loved it,Our grandson started using it immediately. He didn't try the stakes he just spread the bases in a square and had everyone playing ball on christmas. When he got back home he got his friends and used the bases for kickball. When he is happy we are happy
4,Ring introduction critique,"This is very worthwhile, at the same time it requires time, patience and attention, but it does provide some keys to better enjoyment of a sensational piece of music."
4,It's Suitable,"I actually shopped around for BIG bathroom type rugs for my drums...but, for much cheaper I get something made specifically for my drum kit. I sorta wish it were just a LITTLE heavier duty. It folds neatly and goes right into it's neat little carrying bag. Overall...really like it and glad I bought it!"
5,Good PreMicrobio book,"If you are worrying about taking Microbiology, read this book first. It explains Microbiology in understandable terms and also makes this subject quite interesting. When you finally take mirco, you will be ahead of the class"
4,Recommended reading before a visit to the 5 Stans,"I am reading this book in preparation for my trip to Central Asia.Although this book was written just after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, it offers a richly detailedhistory of this seldom visited part of the world. I am looking forward to seeing what has changed since the author'svisit."
4,Bewitched....3.5-4!,"Nash Kirkland, horror novelist/screen play writer plans to center his next great novel on witchcraft. Although he has successful selling his supernatural works, he is a skeptic. But he has also decided that while he doesn't believe, researching and interviewing self-proclaimed witch, Morgana Donovan, would add an authentic element to his work. As Morgana opens his eyes and his heart, he wonders if she has used her powers to ""bewitch"" him. After all, he has never fallen for anyone as hard and as fast as Morgana. As the two navigate their new relationship, and Nash learns to trust, we are witness to a light hearted romance in a style that only Nora Roberts' can tell. If you enjoy Nora Roberts' works, you will definitely appreciate this easy to read quick romance. I will definitely seek out the rest of the series so that I can find out what happens to not only Nash & Morgana, but what happens with her two cousins (who are also witches) Sebastian and Anastasia."
4,Old favorites are the best.,"I read the series, including this book, years ago and I thoroughly enjoyed it this time as well. Nora Roberts is a magician with words. She winds the magic, twining it throughout with humor and poignancy. She is careful to include even the small characters, like the pets, and she brings everything to a powerful ending....always leaving a door open to continue the saga."
1,Feel cheated again,"I have been reading Nora Roberts for several years; loved most every word. But I am so disappointed when I find myself paying top price for a book which was written years ago. In most cases, the author has vastly improved her writing and this is true of many of my favorites who are also choosing to pull some oldies out of the closet and sell them again. I dislike having to look for published date in a book when I buy one. Oldies belong in a discount shelf where you can choose to read them again for half price. Even so, I read every single word and it finished up beautifully.signed....Ms. Cheapie"
4,"Charming, unusual. Positive Witchcraft and familiars.","This book was a welcome and unexpected relief from the hum-drum of most romances. The characters were vivid, and of course, much larger than life. The use of the Wiccan religion as a background was quite detailed and fairly true to life. Although, of course, most modern day Witches do not levitate when they kiss their prospective lovers. The trials and tribulations of our main character, Morgana, as she resists the lure of the obvious husband-to-be, Nash, are somewhat predictable in the independent female type line. However, the addition of her familiar, an Occult shop and the characters that accompany such a lifestyle add a charm and flair rarely seen in such material. The wrap-up include priceless and humourous views of what appears to be a haunted castle deep in Ireland. I can only say - Read It! And then, look for the others. Even now, I am searching for the other two titles in the Donovan Series."
2,Not for hot workareas,"I thought this device would be great for mowing lawns and pastures. While it does filter the air and keep sound levels safe, it's like sticking your head in an oven. Airflow is marginal at best. Just enough to keep the mask from fogging up but definately not enough to keep you from roasting. Too bad because if they could double the airflow this unit would be perfect. My next step is to mate the helmet to a racing helmet blower. Tool Time Tim Taylor would be proud!"
2,A good idea that does not work.,"The fan does not blow enough air into the helmet. If you wear the unit while actively working, your heavy breath will overwhelm the weak air flow.Other reviewers have pointed out the great combination of helmet, hearing protection, face shield and air cleaning. There just is not enough airflow to keep the face shield from fogging up. The helmet gets so hot it is intolerable. Many reviewers mention the problem in passing. I should have paid more attention. Professional units like the one made by 3M cost a lot more but they work."
2,Disappointed in this product,"I thought this post-it-note dispenser was for the accordian type notes. I don't see the purpose for this one, since the pad just lies inside this dispenser; no different than placing the notes directly on my desk."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Like everyone else probably did, I ordered this set going by the list posted in another comment of what it included. I was especially excited about Deadtime Stories, one of my favorites. So I was very sad when I recieved the set, and it was not included. Here is a revision of the other person's list. Included but not listed: Devil Times Five, I Eat Your Skin, Messiah of Evil, and Werewolf In A Girl's Dormitory. Listed but NOT included: Christmas Evil, Deadtime Stories, and Milpitas Monster. Other than that, they are pretty bad quality, of course, but fun to watch."
4,Cheezy interesting classic,"One has to consider that this movie was not made by big Hollywood producers.That being said,the viewer has to watch it in a totally different light.Interesting in its own right,I am happy I purchased this movie to my classic collection.Interesting monster.I am tired of all these computerized creatures.I really enjoy a monster ""in a rubber suit"" sort of speak for a change."
2,Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,"Good movie selections, mostly, with a few great out-of-print movies and a few dogs. Picture and sound quality, though, is terrible."
4,It's not all horror movies,"As stated in a previous review, cheesy thrillers aren't as entertaining to me as cheesy horror. If you feel the same way, there are still some gems in this set worth picking up, you can never pick up a set like this and get a box set full of movies you love, but for the few that are watched more then once, it pays for the whole set."
3,Defrosted,"Not as good as Mystery Classics. Really disturbing are the films that are reproduced looking fuzzy, almost as if they were watercolors."
3,"Horror, Mystery, Crime, etc.","This 50-pack seems to be a mix of lots of genres of Grade B/C films. There are some horror titles, things I would call ""mystery"" movies, some ""crime"" related themes, etc.As with other 50-packs, a others have said, the reproduction of most films has flaws you can see since they went straight from film to DVD with no ""restoration"" effort, of course. (Who can expect it for these prices?) But I found most things watchable.And, as with other sets, there were a few surprises in what I ended up liking.I rated it just a ""3,"" though, since the set mixes too many genres of film under the label of ""chills."" I think of ""chills"" as ""scary"" films in some way and perhaps the title ""thrills"" may be better since many of these are far from ""scary"" films."
3,Needs a CD with audio examples!,"Pretty good resource, but an Audio CD of pieces covered would make it an Excellent resource. The price is too high for the book alone."
5,Fantastic!,"These are fantastic! I tried ear candling as a recommendation by a friend. I had a lot of discomfort in my right ear for a couple months before this. You should have seen the amount of wax that came out of it! I have not had any discomfort in that ear since. Plus, I was amazed at how much my hearing improved. I guess my years of q-tipping left a build up of wax in my ears that only these candles could help. I have definitely been converted."
1,These are a joke!,"These so called ""incense "" are sold on Amazon as ear candles! It even says ""ear canceling instructions included"" (which btw is not true...). Please safe your money, because they do NOT work! The yellow, brown residue is NOT your ear wax, but residue from the candle We even burned one by itself, and we used 2 in our ears... Result was the same: brown, yellow residue. Even the one which we just burned by itself I can not belief that Amazon endorses these as ear candles... ! . I sent mine back for a full refund!"
2,RotoZip Disappoints,"Doesn't meet the minimum operational quality I have come to expect from Bosch. Although it does the basic work expected, the Zipmate attachment has a very flimsy flip lock to lock this attachment to the basic RotoZip tool, this poor design error was made twice when they used the same system to lock the cutting wheel guard to a fixed position on the Zipmate attachment. After becoming disconnected several times with almost no use, both of these quick lock clamps broke, without any adjustment on my part, ruining the rubber bit lock-on grip. I solved the clamp system by replacing both with SS radiator clamps that requires a screwdriver to remove or adjust"
3,"Not pretty, but works","Had mine for about 3 weeks. It works and does its job which is what I wanted. It is definitely a refurb, it came pretty beat-up scuffs, scrapes and dings, more than I expected for a refurb. The cutoff attachemnt being the most beat up. All the parts came (for me) in a large tool bag. So far it works well, when I got it there were 2 or 3 bent and damaged washers in the bottom of the bag, I was worried these were pieces of the unit, but haven't had any issues yet. If you don't mind that it may not be pretty, then it is well worth the price."
1,HATE it!,"Muffins stick something terrible, and they come out a weird shape and texture. If you've got to grease it anyway, what's the point? I just chucked it in the Goodwill."
2,Disappointed at Best,It may be a good book for some but I felt it too general in scope to help me with my new Nokia E71x. The hand book for my phone offers more specific information but not enough. It's like buying one of those Idiots Guide to 30 different but similar computers and expecting to squeeze every nuance out of the one you bought. Maybe for academics but too general to be serious help.
3,Hmm... So-so.,"Very small, the cross I mean. Does NOT look like what is on the picture. EX: It's not dark, and the entire cross is flat. However, it is still cute. Just disappointed it doesn't look like what was promised on the picture. The sellers though, work and answer very quickly."
5,Beautiful!!,"This ring is absolutely stunning in person. I was honestly a little worried that because the price was so affordable, that the ring wouldn't look that great in person. But I was very wrong, and it looks beautiful! Very simple, yet, elegant ring for every day wear. Also you could wear this with any type of outfit and still goes well. Oh one other thing... I was worried about the top and bottom of the cross catching on things. The way the ring fits, the top and bottom part of the cross are snug to the finger (but not so snug that it's uncomfortable!), and I never have a problem with it getting caught on anything...just an f.y.i. :)"
3,So sweet,The sound of the islands of paradise..... It's simple but it's well done. It's just music for happy moments and to feel goodand free..... Thank you GlennAlain
3,No package problem,"I have yet to put these up, but I did not have the packaging problems others have had. Though, I think it came from Ohio and I'm in Indiana, so it was probably not handled much."
4,A newlywed's gift from above!,This collection of easy to prepare recipes is full of wonderful ideas for creating weeks of delicious vegetarian meals without days of left-overs.
4,Colorful & simple mobile,"Our infant son (now 6 mos) has enjoyed watching these colorful birds fly above his crib since the day we hung it up! The shapes are abstract but interesting, and the movement is random, which I like. It would be nice if it spun a little longer, but I just give it another push & he smiles gleefully watching it.Only negative comment, I won't let him play with the birds because of the magnets. Other than that, we love it!"
5,Robert,I bought this and have had no problems intigrating it with my system. The sound quality is fantastic and it looks as cool as its picture. I started with a low-end center channel and the upgrade to this one will last me for years. Great technology and great big full sound -- this is a great speaker!
3,ac adapter for camera,"ITS TO BAD THIS COULD NOT BE A DIRECT CONNECT TO THE CAMERA INSTEAD OF HAVING TO REMOVE THE BATTERIES AND REPLACE IT WITH THIS ITEM, BESIDES THAT IT FUNCTIONS WELL"
4,Does the job,"Nothing really relevant to say, charges the camera while in use, doesn't heat the camera like most chargers.Easy to use, easy to connect, good accessory for your video shootings."
5,One of the best!,"Mary-kate and Ashley are two twin sisters who are nonething alike! Ashley likes cooking and ballet while Mary-kate love soccer and baseball, when they become roomates at their boarding school, Mary-Kate gets the perfect plan to turn Ashley into a perfect roomate!"
5,It's a real keeper!!!,This story of Lucy and Jack will live in your hearts forever. Renee Roszel wrote the story in such a way that her characters seem to come to life! This book is all about what it's like to love someone and pray to God that they return your love. Jack loved Lucy for so many years. Many of us would give anything to be loved like that. This book makes you believe in love all over again!
2,Lamentable.,Lamentablemente la informacion proporcionada po Amazon no es correcta.No tiene audio ni subtitulos en español como si tenian las anteriores temporadas.
1,It's Time!,Enough of this Season 1 vol 1 Season 2 vol 1 crap! Give us the complete series in one package already. It's Time! PLEASE!!!
2,WARNING,"I have loved the series thus far. I was thrilled to find the avenues taken for each character so well developed.BUT - HAUNTED is exactly that. Sure you can expect Hell to be, well Hell but Armstrong goes sick and twisted towards the end. I can not read 300 pages and shut a book, I gotta know what happens. You may need therapy or a calming medication to read and follow the Hell dimension descriptions.Armstrong also for the first time has to throw a lot of information at you just to keep the storyline going. Sure the afterlife has to be complex but you as a story follower should still be able to (follow). I was disappointed in the writing of the tale itself and how far down the rabbit hole Armstrong went with serial killers and spinal cords. The movie Hostel didn't have were wolves and spell casting so why should it be necessary to go rated yuck.After the strength of the previous books, Haunting disappoints."
3,"Haunted, almost made it",I have read all of Kelley Armstrongs books in the Women of the underwork series and I must say that this one was very nice but it fell very flat for me in the end. The books basic premis is that Eve is sent on a mission and has to team up with an Angel in order to catch a spiritual serial killer. The Idea sounded really great and the book went along great until the end. Here is where it dies for me. Eve has to catch this spirit of this serial killer which has envaded the body of a family friend. She gets to go see her daughter and has a vrey piongnent Mother Daughter moment. Eve realizes that she cant stay with her daughter and that she needed to move on. I thnik that in the action the story got lost and it felt like she was just trying to give a happy ending. There was however a very nice teaser at the back of the book for the next in the series.
3,"Not as ""kid-friendly"" as I had hoped","I was disappointed in this CD because it contained a little too much opera for children to understand - there was also some actual dialog in one of the numbers that I didn't even understand, let alone my little grandsons! I would have preferred some different operas than some of the ones on this CD."
4,hooah!,"Being in the military I do a lot of pushups and this well help to improve my stats on my next physical test. I give this an offical ""hooah"" rating. Good stuff for anyone in the military!"
2,not good,"It's dirty and old, seems like has been used for a year. the bottom is slippery, it moves all the time when i do push up on my hard wood floor. it is not cool!"
2,picture on box is not what is inside,Very cheaplly made of black lookink plastic.Hand grips are thin foam.I weigh 190 lbs and afraid they will break because they do bend..
3,Push up bars,"These are good, inexpensive push up bars. Anyone doing a more intensive exercise program may want to go with more durable ones not made of plastic (though I have had no problem with them thus far)."
4,I like them,"So I am using these all the time In my room. I do push ups everyday when I wake up, in the afternoon, and in the evening. I would have given these 5 stars If it didn't break when my brother used them. I guessed that's because He doesn't know how to use them, I hope he did, and I hope these were a little more stronger. Other than that, The are perfect for my work out. Perfect for upper body work out."
3,Adequate,"These are acceptable, but come with a downsides:1) After several uses the black, cushioned part of the handle begins to slip. After three weeks of use, it has not slipped significantly while in use, but it makes me always grip extra hard to prevent it from doing so.2) While doing push ups with an extra wide width/grip, one side flipped or rolled. This would have been prevented if the base was a little wider.For the price, it was a good purchase, but I suspect if I was doing it over, I would buy a par of bars with a good wide base and that had a better cushioned grip handle that would stop it from sliding."
3,Ok,"These bars seem little flimsy and they squeek when I use them, but they have worked fine so far- they have not broken and are easy to use."
1,Scary.,"Thomas Jefferson and James Madison must be spinning in their graves. This book seeks to undo everything they worked to achieve for us. Tolerance is tossed, in favor of a very narrow pseudo-Christian ideology of buttinsky selfishness."
5,Hutschenreuther Blenheim collector,"This is the china my grandmother selected for her good china when she got married. In the 1920's this was quite an extravagance. Over time, I added to her collection. When my grandmother passed, the collection went to my mother, and over time I added to her collection. I now have the china and I cherish it. I use it often and friends and family always comment on its beauty. I now have nearly a full service for 20, together with most of the serving pieces. I am, however, always on the lookout for some pieces to fill out my set. I believe the fruit bowl I purchased from Amazon.com brings me to 20. As with all my Amazon.com purchases, this one came quickly and beautifully packaged. It was in mint condition, as described. I will continue to use Amazon when I need something."
4,Sights and Sounds of the Sixties,are reviewed in these ads. It was like stepping back into the past. Brought back some great memories. Great book.
4,Berlioz - Les Troyens,"Berlioz - Les Troyens is a 1994 Decca Recording starring the Orchestre symphonique de Montreal under the direction if Charles Dutoit. This production lacks a big star in either of the roles. Which makes the performances good but not great. The booklet contains close to 250 pages. Hugh Mcdonald has written informative music notes. Also included is a synopsis. The lyrics are available in German, French, English and Italian. It also contains photographs of the performers from the time of the recording. A very fine recording but not great. Still good enough to get 4 out of 5. 4/5."
3,Lange Practice test for USMLE step 1 review,The content and the format are similar to the Step 1 exam though a little less challenging. A good book to supplememt Kaplan Qbank and Qbook. Not a good book to start off with as there are some mistakes which can be misleading. The explanations are good and to the point.
2,Not the usual,"while this book wasn't quite what I've come to expect from the TB series, it at least focuses on the more teenaged aspects pf the character's life. I can't wait to read the next book, Melanie's Double Jinx. Though, it does make me sad to know that we only have 4 books left."
5,Outstanding!-Healed without Scares,"I recomend this book to anyone that is having a rough time with life on lifes terms. That no matter what is going on in your life,that you do not have to feel the way you are feeling about your self and other people anymore. That Ex Husband or wife, the abusive realationship, or just buliding a New realationship with the Lord. I'm reading it for the 3 time right now and I tell you ,I will read it again. You can be free from emotional bondage, that the enemy has held us long enough. My God Bless you on your Journey."
4,Great Game- Really bad music,The game is great and worth getting but the music (all of it)sucks. One track in particular- Stroll Around the World is pure garbage and annoying as hell. It's on one of the earlier levels so it must be endured every single time you play. I have not played the first Lumines but if it has the same gameplay and better music you should probably get that one instead.
4,To the point,This book cuts through a lot of the nonsense making flax and it's benefits clearly understood. I like the fact that I could open the book at any page and just begin reading. I'm certainly a Flax fan now!!
5,hidden beauty,this film hidden beauties contains some classic looking women in tasteful scenes the movie has some otherworldly artistic qualities and is well made for its genre and underrated ben
3,Great Value Poor Brake Power,"Now I love these for the price under 10 dollars.Unfortunately the bike doesn't stop very well, I could probably change the brake pads and they would work better.But the brake pads are not very good.The overall construction of the brakes seem very good though.I would buy different brakes but these are fine for what I use them for.SO, if you are using these brakes for relatively flat ground or for a childs bike you will be fine, but for actual quick-stopping power these are not the brakes to get. Unless you get different brake pads."
4,ppa-15,"These are not as efficient as many of the high end speakers (jbl, peavey, ete) look at the sensitivity rating 90.2 db. This means it take more power to produce the same sound level. That being said for the money these are well built woofers and sound good. It does slighty overpower my horn but I can EQ that so if you looking for a affordable replacement speaker I would say its worth the money."
5,"Excellent - Deeply Disturbing, yet Excellent","I read this book in German, so I can not comment on the prose of the translation. However, I thought this book was so incredible it was worth a review. Jan Philipp Reemtsma went through hell and back, not only on a physical level, but also on an emotional, psychological level. His description of the events is elegantly written and deeply personal - bringing the reader into the cellar with him and letting the reader understand his struggles and emotions. The book is not written as a suspensful story, but as a raw account of the truth. I recommend this to everyone who wants to read something real, something disturbing yet excellent."
5,Joint Locking Techniques the Chinese Taijiquan Way,"This is possibly my shortest review so far as I really don't know what I can add to this video that hasn't already been expanded upon greatly by the other reviewers, but I will give it a try.Obviously if a video comes from YMAA and especially Dr. Yang himself, you know that it is going to be an informative, highly detailed, and very well produced with literally hours upon hours worth of quality instruction for a very reasonable price and this video is no exception.Dr. Yang forgoes the normal punching, kicking, striking, and throwing techniques for the more subtle yet never-the-less impressive joint techniques and body manipulations found so extensively in other perhaps more well known martial arts of Hapkido, Jujitsu, and Aikido.If you are studying any of the grappling or joint locking arts, regardless of the particular style, then this two-disc DVD would definitely be worth your investment.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVD's."
5,My Favorite Feng Shui Book,"I probably own half a dozen Feng Shui books, and while others have some good introductory material, this is the book I refer to again and again. It's full of reference material on the five elements, Chinese astrology, and how to apply the Ba Gua to your own house. I thought it was all very accessible and easy to follow."
3,Very little substance,"If you know nothing about Feng Shui, this book could be useful. It skips lightly over the surface of this ancient and complex practice leaving you with more questions than answers. It ends by telling you how to find a reputable Feng Shui expert to solve any problems. The author is very careful not to suggest any remedies to conditions that do not meet with Feng Shui principles."
4,This Book was Interesting,"This book told a lot of information, but not about how to DO Deng Shui on your home. It does explain the concept of chi energy with good diagrams."
2,Not what it is meant to be,"Remember the old saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover""? Well, this is just the case. So much background info and data, that certainly proves that the author spent considerable time and effort in his studies, but unfortunately barely anything of the real narrative exists in this book. For those of you who think that this is the Rihla by Ibn Battuta, I advise you to save your money, time, and effort unless you are only interested in the background info and not the real thing itself."
1,Very disappointing......,Great title - bad book. Poorly developed characters and a plot that does not take you anywhere.
1,Poison,"Well! Well! More nonsense from the finder of the lost Ark. The list of absurdities nonsense, miinterpretations and outright rubish would take many volumes. But suffice to say the rot about Teotihuacan was enough to turn me off. The ""face"" on Mars turns up again. Now that the ""face"" has been shown to be a natural feature will we hear a little humility? I doubt it. I strongly recommend that this book be used only as a door stop."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I felt like I could have figured out for myself the things the book covered. Of course, if convenience is your main reason for wanting the book, it does have some useful info. I didn't like some of the unnecessary things they included in an attempt to make sure diversity was appreciated. It was distracting and rather annoying."
4,"Great book,but could have been more extensive","Being that I own the Xena guide written by Robert Weisbrot,I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. What I got was a book that was not as extensive as it should have been. The individual episode summaries should have been more detailed than they were. If Weisbrot had written this one,no doubt they would have been. However,I did enjoy reading about the final four seasons,and for that I give it 4 out of 5 stars."
4,Toss-Up,"Althought this is a good book, I would not recommend it as a primary purchase (try ""Wine for Dummies"" or ""Windows on the World Complete Wine Course"") nor as a secondary purchase (try ""Wine Bible"" or ""Oxford Companion to Wine""), but I would recommend it as a tertiary purchase. There is a decent amount of material presented in a professional and eye-pleasing manner. Be forewarned that the book is large (9""x11"") and heavy -- probably not something you would read in bed. The coverage of the different areas is pretty good, but not exceptional, hence my four-star rating."
1,Product Longer Than Advertised,"The product description advertises that this bar can accommodate door frames measuring 24"" to 32"" wide, however the product itself actually measures just shy of 25"" when completely compacted. If you have a standard 24"" wide bathroom door, this product will be of no use to you."
5,Great product!,Came just when it should have and is a great product that my brother bought! :) I would recommend this to anyone who wants it!
2,"Cheap, but hard to find a place to put in the house.","It was hard to find a place to put this, and you have to drill screws into the door or wall. It was cheap though and able to hold my weight."
4,Excelent Durability,"The product is very simple and straight forward. It does'nt have a bunch of little peices that you can lose or misplace. The one draw back to this product is that the mounting hardware is a little bit to small for drilling into a solid door frame(you will definatly need a power drill). One of the biggest benefits about this product is that it can be used WITHOUT THE HARDWARE! You can simply place it in the door jam and keep expanding it until it is locked ito place by pressure, awsome!"
5,GoFit Chin-Up Bar,The quality of this chin-up bar exceeds that of those in any of the stores in my area and the price is lower. It was easy to install. I use it on a regular basis. It is a great product.
1,it broke!,"ii was solid for about a week before starting to spin. It's impossible to do proper pull ups on a bar that won't stay in place!I'm a 140 pound woman, there's no reason it shouldnt be working properly.Does anyone know how to fix this?"
1,Didn't work for me...,Maybe mine is defective but it just spins around even when fully tightened. Cheesy looking construction as well..
2,Measure your doorway!,"I have a 25"" doorway, and it did not fit. I guess it's my fault for not checking beforehand, but you would think the thing would be adjustable to fit what I consider to be a normal sized doorway."
4,Love the machine,We have made bread and used it to make pizza dough. I have never had a bad loaf or bad dough. It is so easy to use. I am buying one for my mother for x-mas. I recommend this machine.
5,deluxe breadmaker,We have used the breadmaker and are very satisfied. I would recommend it to anyone. I like the idea of making a bigger loaf than 11/2 lbs. The McGees
5,THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!!!!,"WOW! I am really impressed with this flat iron being a woman of color, those department store brand flat iron's are a waste of good money after i chose this iron based on the reviews i read i noticed it was the same one being used at the salon i go to. I felt so good that i had made the right choice i absolutely love it."
5,A Doctor at Calvary is an extremely important finding. Must be studied at will.,"REQUIRED STUDYThis study is an extremely fine investigation into a subject we would rather forget, the real suffering HE ENDURED"
3,Groundbreaking ideas,"Some people will be very attracted by the story format and may be more likely to read the book because of it, and that's good, because this book has some wonderful ideas about how changing our own self-perceptions can create peace in our relationships. I liked the ideas presented and I will find them useful. I personally would have preferred just a factual book but I was ok with the story wrap-around. I wish the book had an appendix of the charts and key ideas, or that the Arbinger Institute had a set of charts available (even if they were for sale instead of freely available) on their website."
5,Enlightening,"This book is particularly enlightening. The basic premises of the book have changed the way I look at people. These include family, neighbors, and the guy in the car next to me on the freeway. I have found myself more patient with others, kinder in my responses to others, and enjoying the benefits that come when the other people are treated with consideration."
5,New Insight on Leadership and Relationships,"I have read many books on leadership, and have yet to find another that expresses the same concepts as Anatomy of Peace. Some of the ideas seem so practical that I wondered why the ideas had not occurred to me.Initially, I thought this book was redundant to Leadership and Self Deception, the Arbinger Institute's earlier publication. Then I realized that Anatomy of Peace was richer and deeper, fleshing out ideas expressed in the earlier publication.This is a book that every person who influences others should read. Even if a person doesn't consider him or herself a leader, all people live in relationship with others. This book is an invaluable resource."
4,Not bad for a filmation production,"From the creature's of He-Man give's you ""Bravestar"". This man was a western who could turn into Bear, wolf, panter, and hawk. His horse was also a fighter too."
5,Boskovsky's Secret,"Before purchasing this two-CD set last year ..., I did considerable shopping for the ""perfect"" Strauss collection. Even at the time of purchase, all the Boskovsky hype left a nagging concern that these pieces might reflect too much Willi and not enough Strauss.No need for concern. This offering is a treasure.Part of Maestro Boskovsky's secret seems to be a perfect mix of technique and technicality -- a blend to please the romantic, the purist, and even us music lovers who are a little of both. His conducting reflects feeling and passion but without crossing the line and affecting the integrity of the music.And the selection is great. Not only do we get the usual ""suspects"" but some slightly lesser known waltzes as well. Don't miss the energetic performance of Morning Papers, with its memorable brass passages played here to perfection.Don't worry that it isn't a DDD recording; it's great digital stereo. Besides, it's the Vienna Philharmonic and Boskovsky! Highly recommended."
4,Pretty Good,"I was really glad to find this. I watched it right away and was happy, but not impressed. I would reccomend this because it is neat to see behind the scenes. I just wish that all the songs were on it, not just some of them. Otherwise, it is Great."
3,Poor Quality Control?,"I've been using the Ridata brand of mini-DVD in my camcorder for nearly 3 years now, usually buying them 10 at a time. This time I bought the 50-pack since I've never had a problem with them. The first ones I've tried out of these appear to be unbalanced or out-of-round, though. My camcorder definitely vibrates more when the disks are up-to-speed. I have finished recording on one of them and it appeared to finalize okay. I'm just disappointed with Ritek's quality control system that would let these get out the door."
2,Only one half of the DVD's were burn-able,Not very satisfied. We burned the DVD's and at least half those attempted to be burned were bad. Not the best product!
2,Noticeable vibration - I regret my purchase!,"I bought these DVD-R's for my Sony camera, and i regret the purchase - they noticeably vibrate when recording - I have Googled about this and most folks say they should play fine and preserve your media, but its annoying when you are using them."
2,Disappointing,"When you buy a CD like this, the one thing you expect of the artist is to nail the intro to Toccata and Fugue In D Minor, Bach's great masterwork and the lead piece on the CD. Unfortunately, the organist plays the intro robotically, truncating notes and overextending pauses. He rushes some passages so badly in the intro that one cannot distinguish the melodic line. Toccata and Fugue In D Minor is so musically advanced that it sounds modern even today, but you miss that with this recording."
1,What a mess....,"I can't understand how this set of CDs got so many rave reviews. Peter Hurford is a very sloppy organist. He misses notes all over the place, has very messy rhythms, and a very non-baroque interpretation of Bach's music. It makes me wonder if some of the other reviewers who ""play organ"" have only had a few lessons, but little or no formal music training. This set of discs was so disappointing and annoying that I actually threw them away. If you want to listen to great organ music, try some Michael Murray."
1,I'm dissapointed,"The seller didn't say that the computer display didn't work. Even tough that it had the status of refurbished, the seller should indicate that it was broken. The seller and the web site never showed that detail."
3,Fuzzy Duck - self-titled (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1971, this was the band's sole effort. Features Five Day Week Straw People's bassist Mick Harnsworth and keyboardist Roy Sharland. Maybe not the masterpiece that a few fans have claimed it to be, but a decent CD to take out for a spin now and again. Best described as progressive/psych. Tunes that sort of stood out include the funky opener ""Time Will Be Your Doctor"", ""Afternoon Out"", ""Double Time Woman"", plus the four(4) added bonus tracks aren't bad either. Might appeal to fans of The Creation, The Attack and maybe even Caravan or The Strawbs."
3,"A good CD, but not as great as her first two.","This CD does have its share of good tracks. No Voy a Llorar easily compares to anything from Palabra de Mujer. However, the whole CD isn't consistently good. Track #5 shamelessly samples Christina Aguilera's Genie in a Bottle. I'm not saying it's a sin to sample, but to do so from a teen-pop artist is a bad idea. It's a shame, because the overall song is good. Also, some of the ballads sound a bit boring, mostly because she's done similar ballads on her earlier albums. An example of this is De Que Me Sirve Ya, which doesn't break any new ground. Also, I think that Hotline is a very ""campy"" dance song, but won't appeal to some of her fans. Finally, Ain't It Better Like This has trite lyrics, and exposes the fact that Monica needs to work more on her English-language vocal delivery, if she wants to sucessfully release Bad Girls in America.All of this aside, the album does have enough good material on it to justify its purchase."
1,Nuts,"So, how well does that new wrenchless chuck with the red wheel work? Vizualize the bit falling out twice the first time you cut the sheetrock out of a window opening. Vizualize a tool which NEEDS a wrench, but unlike the previous models is not designed to be tightened with a wrench and provides no place to store a wrench. The wrenchless chuck gives a whole new meaning to the words ""reverse engineering"".And BTW, if you had any attachments for your old style rotozip forget em - they won't fit the new models according to the Rotozip website."
2,Timer stinks,"Bought this unit and set it up, within a month timer stopped working properly where I could not reset times. Called Moultrie and they said to I had to disassemble unit send it back to them and they would see if they could get me a new one.6-8 weeks turnaround time. Told them In 8 weeks the deer season would be over and they suggested I BUY a new timer from them. Poor service so I contacted sportsmans guide who shipped me a brand new unit to exchange , no questions asked(Good service). Hooked up the new timer and guess what? In a month it would not program properly. Moultrie has some issues."
2,bare bones,"This dictionary came packaged with an audio Italian language course. Having brought it along on several trips to Italy, I've found it to be inadequate. The range of words defined in this volume is limited, and many common words have been omitted altogether. My advice - pick up a better one, such as the Langenscheidt or Larousse."
4,Delicious Chocolate,"Good book, well researched, but not much different to other books written on this subject. However, as a chocolate addict anything written about the best food on earth gets me in and for the research content and general easy to read writing style I give it a 4 star rating."
4,Very powerful,-Excellent heat for large cooking projects.-Must have correct pots and pans for this. Heavy cast iron or stainless steel. Does not go low enough for use with lightweight aluminum or cheap stainless steel.-Setup is a breeze vs. the same model with removable legs. Have used both and this one wins hands down.-Make sure you cover in a rainstorm because water will pool in the burners making it very difficult to light.
5,Like new,I am completing my doctoral dissertation on executive coaching and found this book most interesting. It is well written and contains all the information anyone might want on the theoretical and application aspects of EC. I highly recommend the book to anyone.Ethelle Lord[...]
1,Poor Fit,This is a two piece case. It fits poorly in the inner cover. If it was a one piece case it would be much better.
1,Terrible,"Could not get installed. Worked briefly, then dropped signal. No tech support. I reinstalled my old speakers."
4,The nicest little wireless portable speaker for the $$$,"I have found the Saitek A250 to be among the best personal purchases of the past year. It produces clear, powerful sound with no set up at all-truly plug-n-play! The only drawback of this little honey of a setup is the reduced range of the speaker when under battery power. I use it for parties and entertaining outdoors so I can use a pre-set playlist or even satellite radio.... This is a must-have in my book!"
3,I think that in the long run I didnt like them that much,"I bought one of these for Christmas. They have good sound, not too loud, but enough for a small room and you can still hear it near. Bluetooth works ok, but I need to adjust the dongle every now and then because then glitches start, and NEVER believe the manufacturer's wireless range. One thing I didn't liked is that in order for the buttons to work (play/pause, next and previus) with iTunes (for example), iTunes needs to be the active window. That sucks, cause even the keyboard can control iTunes even if it's not the active window. Another problem is the lack of easy control over volume via the computer, you need to either go to the speakers and manually change the volume, or go inside volume properties and look for the speakers (bluetooth device) and only then be able to change volume. Sucks again , huh?"
2,Wireless module never worked,"Speaker sounds good when connected via wire. But could not get the wireless transmitter to work with the speakers. Transmitter malfunctioned. On sync attempt, speaker displayed search mode, the light on transmitter blinked its sequence of search mode. However, after 2-3 minutes, it flashed low battery signal even after it was fully charged. Repeated the instructions at least 3 times after 3 full charges and finally decided to call Saitek support in California. Saitek support was pleasant. And after 10-minute conversation confirming my steps and retrying, tech support deduced that the wireless transmitter was malfunctioned and offered an exchange. Told him that I just bought it from Amazon so.....got my refund from Amazon."
3,For serious 70s Brit-Rock Soundtrack collectors only!,"If you are old enough to remember about this 'strange' movie... You're old enough to remember -and enjoy- Alan Price music.Best of the album: 'Poor People' and the awesome, forgotten superhit 'Sell Sell'.Beware 'Audiophile-quality' CD listeners: the sound quality is really poor... Almost like a sworn Chrome-quality cassette tape..."
4,Doesn't bottom,"Not bad quality overall, but having a conical point on the end defeats the function of a true bottoming tap in a blind hole."
4,Good but not best,"This book was overall good. Not the best though. It is about Melissa, Poppys sister and how she thinks about popy and everyone else. Also how dhe deals with all the poppy-is-perfect thing."
4,a very good working for the whole family,this machine is very good for the whole family and does the job it should do. we use this twice a day between the whole family and after three weeks the only issue i have is the odometer fail to work and a little squeaking sound coming from the machine ( fix with a little sewing machine oil). the only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 was the odometer that dont work.
4,body works 5000,"simple to put together, simple to use,been using for 2 weeks now and am already starting to notice changes in myself. Some excercises took awhile to get myself into position, but with daily use gatting easier. I would recommend this product to family and friends."
2,why hasent it shipped yet,Why has this not shipped yet?Its been three days now and it showesThat it will ship soon?So why hasent it shipped?
4,Not too shabby.,"Ill make this short and sweet, great price, you can't beat it for the price, well built, quite sturdy, could be alittle more user friendly, meaning setting up the machine and retracting back for storage can be a bit of work but nothing to really faulter this machine, surprisingly enough it gives a very decent workout, I've had my machine since the begining of 2007 and so far I've lost 7lbs and its the first week of Feb/07, just 20 to 30 minutes 3 times a week is all it takes, another reason for the 4 star rating is the workout chart provided in the box only has 36 different ways to use this machine and its advertised to do more than twice that, other than that its not too shabby."
4,Great Deal for the price,"This product works great and was very easy to assemble (there are only a few things to attach). My only complaints are that it is a little difficult to extend out into the fully extended position and there is a giant emblem on the pad that tries to make it look like it is some kind of hardcore workout machine. Other that those two minor things, it really gives a good workout, fits into small spaces well and is easy to move around."
4,Like it better than the total gym,"I originally was going to buy the Total Gym but after seeing the Weider and all the things it offered standard rather than having to buy extra parts I made the choice to go with it instead. I was surprised at how sturdy this is as well as how easy it is to use. The workouts are challenging and there is a lot of room for improvement. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a compact, inexpensive home gym."
2,bolt hits,I just got it took 5 min to put together ( took longer to remove plastic ) so far so good. Sat on it pulled and bang - looked everything over ??? tried again same thing the bolt that holds the pulley on was hitting the cross-member - looked under help section other people had same problem but didn't see it in reviews so here I am. Ill call customer service - I can fix it just a little grinding but dont want to void warranty well we will see what they say.I'm sure there is a lot more good machines than bad but I got the bad one so the bad review. For the price minus the bolt it looks like a good machine. So its worth a try.Update - I had to grind down the pully bracket bolt it now clears by 1/8 th inch and works greatstill glad I gave two stars hopefully people will read and will help them.
4,"Great workout, when used carefully","After picking one of these up at a local sports store for $99 and using it for over 2-years, I'm sold. You do have to be careful where you grip when changing the level and initially it feels a little clumsy. When you get past that, the first week, you'll love it. I use it for light and quick (12 minute) total body workouts to multi hour intense high resistance (not bodybuilding) training. Even ROM HITT training.For those who are more serious, there are several other manufactures out there that will provide what you need for $200-300 more."
3,Will work for you,"I have been using this product for weeks, and I have seen great improvement in my biceps and triceps. Adjusting the levels are a little awkward but, I learn how to deal. I think it is a great product for the price, and I would recommend it for anyone trying to get back in shape."
2,disapointed,"Is the product a great deal, compared to the alternatives?I would say yes.Does it seem cheap?I would say yes to that as well.Although heavy, the machine just felt cheap, the pulleys squeaked during almost every rep and it was pretty unbearable.It came damaged during shipment, or likely during storage from the warehouse.I ended up returning it, and went and bought a used total gym for tthe same price and it just blew thins out of the water, way smoother set up, the glide mechanism just feels way better.Overall, i was let down by this product.I will note, I liked the elastic bands for increased resistance."
2,Ened up in the closet.,"I ended up getting a gym membership, this machine is to limited. Its now in a closet, and it takes to much room when its full extended. Its a nice concept though, it just doesn't work that great in reality."
3,ok,"I did not assemble, but instead enlisted my stepfather to do so. Not bad, but it was a little boring. I used it and it simply motivated me to join a gym. I don't know why, but it is certainly a forgettable machine. It is not one of those machines that you can't wait to do when you get home. It seemed durable enough."
3,Good but a little loud and too much of a hastle to change height,"- It isn't very stable but as long as you don't rock yourself on it, you will not fall over. See youtube for a demonstration of a guy using it.- It is a pain to change the height of it so I just leave it on the hardest setting; can't do some things though.- The wheels rolling up makes a little too much noise to work out with roommates at night that are light sleepers but it's not that bad for normal use.- Overall good purchase for cheap price."
4,Could use a little more quality control,"When I received my machine I couldn't wait to put it together and try it. The assembly was easy enough but I noticed some small black pieces of plastic in the box and I did not realize the pieces were part of one of the wheels the platform that you sit or lie on. I soon learned the machine was broke and it could not be used. There was no damage to the box or any other damage except for this wheel. I have concluded the damage was most likely done at the factory in the assembly of the unit. I called the toll free number and talked to a representative and they didn't even apologize for the inconvenience but he seemed eager to sell me an extended service plan for the unit, I declined. They did send me a replacement part (about a week later) and I fixed the machine and it works great, no complaints there. The bottom line is: machine great, customer service needs a little work."
4,love watch but needs a extra large band,"Nice watch, it reminded me of a Hamilton watch my mother purchased for me when I was a kid back in the 60's. I was going to return it because the band is too small and the leather is not going to last. I need to wear it at the gym. I ordered a larger black rubber band from a local jewelry store for $20 and hope it works."
5,Playmate's best figures!,"The Star Trek 12"" dolls by playmates are the best you can get. I was lucky enough to get most of them back when they came out, and I can tell you without a doubt, they are the best parts of my Trek collection. Get these if you can, I promise you will not regret it. These figures are not like their smaller 9"" counterparts but much nicer in detail and character features. 10 out of 5 stars...."
5,"At Last, A Book That Won't Be Used Against Us!","As an owner of several ADBA pit bulls, I am thrilled that at last there is a book out that we can use to help fight breed specific laws in our area. Many of the other books (Like Stratton's and Carl Semencic's) are not the kind of book you would want to take to a town meeting and try and convince them that these dogs can be great pets in responsible hands. Semencic's newest book (Gladiator Dogs) features page after page of snarling, lunging pit bulls. Great! Just what we need! And more dogs on heavy chains like some kind of maniacs! Sure pit bulls must be housed and handled with a little more care around other dogs, but thank you! Diane, for a fresh, intelligent look at our dogs. I for one am donating one to my local library, and sending one to the city council."
1,not worth the paper its written on,"I have 20 different books on APBTs and this is by far the worst. The author has nothing new to say--most of it is a rehash of older, better sources. There are a lot of AKC Amstaff pics mixed in with APBTs here!If you want to learn about APBTs, start out with Stratton's stuff and then try to get the other books he cites in his bibliographies.As far as dog books go, Jean Donaldson and Turid Rugaas are the best modern authors. A lot of people try to keep APBTs from fighting but have no clue how to manage a dog's level of stress or read dog body language."
4,Workout headphones that those that don't like earbuds,"These are great headphones to workout in for those that cannot stand the earbuds; however, you will still encounter background noise. I also really like how the headband goes around the ears: very helpful when on a bouncy machine or course...no sliding off head or buds popping out."
5,Good product. Performs just as expected.,Nice weight. I bought this as my husband's belt sander is older and much heavier. This works great on the surfaces that require this level of sanding. I'm very pleased with the sander. The belt is easy to install and adjjust.
3,Gets really hot,Just bought this. Found that it gets really hot after only 3-4 minutes of use. Also dust port doesn't really blow out the dust. You need to attach a vacuum.
1,Junk!!,"This is the worst tool I've ever purchased from any manufacturer hands down. You would be better off trying to sand the material by hand than use this unit. In my case the sander worked for less than 30 minutes before the motor burned out and Porter Cable wanted me to take it in for repair. Do yourself a huge favor, stay away from this sander."
2,Returned it!,"Unfortunately it seems that the folks who do the packing at Amazon think that if they throw a few air pillows anywhere in the shipping box, it will protect the contents. (Not the first heavy item that I have received damaged)Inside the shipping box, the sander case was scuffed and dirty. The sander inside the case looked like it had been dropped over a cliff and the rubber hand grip was even torn up from rubbing on the inside of the case!I am somewhat glad this happened. Even though I never did any sanding, I'm not sure I would have been happy with the tool itself.It was very heavy and quite wide across the gripping surface. My hand got tired just carrying it around. I can't imagine trying to sand any fair sized project.The cord is supposed to act as a secondary handle, but I did not feel like it would wear very well. It was rather awkward and skinny to use as leverage to control the sander.It seemed very well made, but again too heavy to be used with out a real, properly sized handle."
5,Well Worth The Money,"I purchased the Superwinch Locking Hubs for my 2001 F250. After researching the correct product # at the Superwinch web site, I ordered with Amazon. When ordering with Amazon I was advised that this was not the correct part for my truck. Thinking that the manufacture may know more than Amazon, I ordered anyway. The part arrived 3 day before the suggested date. It was the correct part and was installed in 30min. Looks better than Ford factory and works a heck of a lot better.Superwinch 400439 Premium Manual Locking Hub"
4,JBL N28,"I have had a pair of these for several months. I bought them after comparasion with several other slightly more expensive brands and am reasonably pleased. In this price bracket JBL have tended to be somewhat ""bright"" sounding, but I was pleasantly surprised by how warm these units sounded compared side by side with other products. The bass is tight and not overstated or ""boxy"" which is often a problem with cabinets this size, and the metalic tweeter is crisp and sounds wonderful on rock tracks although is a little harsh on classical strings. For the money I think these are excellent value and well worth serious consideration."
5,Good resource,I first read this book when it came out and recently picked it up again. It's an easy to read book that is probably best for people concerned about their elderly parents welfare. Also good for recent retirees. The book covers a lot of different topics - nothing too in depth - but that keeps the book from getting too dry.
4,D.J. company,"This is a great product, not so loud, but looks good and will work for a nice cocktail or ceremony system........"
2,Not what I expected,"Good sound quality, but product lacks volume and bass. For such a heavy device, I expected a little more ""punch"" to the sound. For something called the ""Block Rocker"" you would expect it to be heard within the area of a block. It is marginally louder than the ipod docking station in my kitchen."
2,"Good at first, took a nose dive in 3 months.","When I first got this thing I was exited, the sound was great, it rocked! THEN... After a few months of use (about once a week) the charge would not hold, the sound got bad, and now it's just a big paper weight. I kept good care of it, the times I used it were always closed doors and away from the sun, water, and heat. So I don't get why it got so degraded so fast.I can still use it if I keep it plugged, but the sound is actually better when it is unplugged! weird but true, when it is plugged it sounds like a busted speaker.I will now go through the pain of contacting the vendor and sending this huge thing back to them for repair or replacement, the shipping will cost me more than what this thing is truly worth.Long story short: I give it two stars because it did work at the beginning, technically still works when plugged to an outlet. But sound quality is below par for something that costs more than $250"
4,Block Rocker Review,Great portabilty and sound with the ipod attached. I would have given it 5 stars if the mic was better for singing....(it's more taylored for speaking.) ~Would have been nice to have some reverb options.
2,Battery life and customer service suck!,"I received my Ion Block Rocker as a gift for Christmas. In July, the battery stopped holding a charge. I have called several times and spent over 25 minutes on hold without ever talking with a customer service tech. I have even sent in several email request for help via their web site. This is a great product, however, if I can not get the battery to hold a charge, what could is it other than a hugh ipod charger?I feel I just received a product with a bad battery(it happens). I give the product 5 stars, but I hope you never have an issue with it because you will never get any help from customer support. This is why I only gave it two stars."
4,Hot Stuff,"Everywhere I go with this thing everyone wants to know: How much, how portable, how long does it last & how loud so I thought I'd answer it here:How much = we will leave that up to Amazon but it is a great but for the price I paid (under $300)How Portable = VERY. You can lift it roll it anywhereHow long does it last = Full charge on ipod with very little tinkering 4 -5 hours(pretty damm good)How Loud = It does a good job. It can keep 30 people moving and dancing with no problem. Don't expect it to be the main soundsystem at a party but to teach a class or chill with friends it is PERFECTI HIGHLY recommend buying this over any other solution."
2,Ironman Watchband,"ordered the band, after receiving found out it was too large (super Ironman i guess).. So feeling frustrated, i visited our local Target store and purchased a new watch of the same type. Emailed vendor and asked if i could return and where--got address and sent back via USPO and after several weeks the vendor says they didn't receive?? Better off just buying a new watch--so much for recycling in this situation!! Oh, before ordering I checked all the usual local sources and no one carries this watchband.."
2,Did not fit my watch model.,It said it would fit my watch model but it was incorrect. I would recommend the velcro strap before I would this one.
1,Ashkenazy sucks,"Oh yes the perfect modern pianist, fantastic technique, giant reportorie, well practiced and all his playing sounds just like the music is written. Yep, sounds just like a machine pounding out ""perfect"" notes on a keyboard. No wonder Classical piano is a dying art form, because with the likes of a ""cardboard piano robot"" like Ashkenazy, the real feel of the music is completely lost. Why is this supreme typist so excessively recorded? fits well into the Disneyland mentality of our capitalist system I suppose. May as well listen to a wind up toy."
1,Cord Problems,"I bought these headphones because I like the behind the ear wrap-around style and this was what was available. My last pair lasted me two years but, sadly, these only lasted three months.The problem is with their ""tangle-free"" cord. Sony wrapped a rubber cord with a tight knit mesh weaving in order to reduce tangling. The problem is that the cord still tangles a bit and mesh weave opens up. The inner-cord, which is not nearly as strong as a standard headphone's cord slipped its way out of the mesh weave and snapped.The sound quality was pretty good, although I would have liked a little more bass, and the folding was convenient. However, a cord that breaks after three months of use is absurd and so is the $27 dollar replacement cost."
3,NOt noise cancelling,I read that this headset was noise cancelling. It is not. There is no battery and on an airplane the quality is not very good. In a quiet enviroment they do sound pretty good with an ample amount of bass. I walk with them often and they do work out if you wear a hat. My recommendation thought is to get a pair of true noise cancelling headsets.
4,Excellent Product,"I love the sound quality and the way I am able to exercise and not notice that I have headphones on. The headphones don't slide but I have had some difficulty adjusting them for a more snug fit. Overall, well worth the money."
3,Not comfortable enough,"The quality of the headphones is pretty good but not amaizing. I love the nontangle wire, very nice invention. The size if the neck band is good, not too large, you could rest your head back. The biggest issue is comfort, there is not enough space between the earcup and neckband for most ears to fit and my ears are very standard. After about an hour of wearing them the tops of your ears will start to hurt.If they change the design a little, put an arch above the ear instead of a straight line they would get 5 stars."
3,Not that comfortable,"I'm a runner, and I wore this but 15 minutes and realized they were not going to work for me. The part that slips over the ears rubbed just enough to make my ear red and uncomfortable. It may be the shape of my ear, I don't know, because I know others said these headphones were really comfortable, but for me just that small discomfort was enough for me to return them. The sound was great, though, but beware if you have sensitive skin around your ears."
4,Beware multiple orders,"Batteries came promptly and were fresh but I ordered 5 and not all had safety caps as shown in the picture. This left the possibility of contact between adjacent batteries with no cap and risk of fire or battery damage. The caps did not come off - they were not even in the package. Hopefully, they will read this and remedy the situation at shipping."
2,Where's the beef?,"This book doesn't have much past good old common sense. Sure they looked at several companies but I didn't read any gems or how-to points that would help any startup that someone with some brains wouldn't figure out on their own. And very annoying, as someone else pointed out, he has plenty of page filler that's exact copies of stories or parts of stories in multiple spots in the book! The Elevator story must have been repeated 3 times. Good that it's selling for very low in the used section because that's what it's worth."
1,Weak,"Weak, weak, so very weak. Just as weak startups should never be started in the first place, some books (about startups, the irony) should never be printed in the first place. A tear for the tree who got cut in order to print this book. Such waste..."
4,"it's good, but pls get 2A power supply instead","I purchased this switch 3 years agohappy with it, however, the supplied power adaptor seems not to provide enough current, it runs hotit seems to have more current power adaptor to run (at least 2A, do not use the supplied adaptor)now I install it vertically on the wall, just warm to touch (just use 3 out of 8)for more stable operation, a stronger power supply is recommended (at least 12-15V 2A)"
5,Excellent Design and Value,An excellent inexpensive no-hassle networking device constructed of metal that fits perfectly into my home networking system. I recommend this to anyone!
1,Power Problems,"The power connector on my FS108 is very sensitive - try to shift the unit or move the power cord in any way and it goes into a fit, flashing all lights and all connected devices indicate they have lost their network connection. My friend reports the same problems with his. Mine is being relegated to the spares drawer as soon as I purchase a replacement - not another Netgear. A shame, it is otherwise a nice switch."
4,Great Switch! But runs HOTTT!,Features 8 ports of 10/100 Full-duplex ability. It comes in very durable metal casing and feels somewhat heavy. It is truly plug and play. Compared to my generic (TrendNet 5-port 10/100 full-duplex switch) it blows it out of the water. I get better pings across my home network and when loaded with 7 computers transfering files at 100mBits full-duplex it shines! The only con is that it runs HOT! Be sure to place it where it can breathe and not next to anything heat-sensitive.
2,"Promising, but unreliable","I have several of these switches in place and every few months I start seeing huge amounts of latency and dropped packets in my Internet connection. After going back and forth with various ISPs and checking everything else, I realized the problem was in these switches. Unplugging the FS108, waiting a second and plugging it in, the problem instantly disappears. After some periods of time, and possibly under occasional heavy use, these switches begin to not function properly and need to be reset. Once they're reset, they work fine. This is an otherwise solid unit except it cannot be left unattended and operate reliably in my experience. Unfortunately, that's what these switches should do."
5,Revolutionized Quiet Time,"This book has turned my world upside down! It has given me greater vision, better use of my time, and has challenged me to spend much better quality time with the Lord each morning. It is definitely a book that I will review several times. It has transformed my Bible study methods, and has impacted my prayer life to such an extent that there doesn't seem to be enough time to get what I want accomplished in the allotted time. I leave with my cup half full, longing to get back at it the next morning. It has touched my life to the extent that I have bought several copies to give away to men eager to deepen their spiritual walk with the Lord."
2,not that good,"This was actually a disappointing film for me. The only part I liked was all the ""your mama"" jokes that occurred between the one woman and the guy working behind the register at a fast food restaurant.The fat jokes were really obvious and not very good, in my opinion. The storyline was pretty weak too. Still, I didn't mind watching the movie, I just wish it was funnier."
5,Seriously good fun,"I really enjoyed this film, not only for the message it gave but also, as a Nigerian, I was in stitches for the poolside banter.I find Mo'nique a very good actress and she delivers her lines with comic timing. I found her character very believeable but also I think she as a woman would be a great friend to have in your life."
4,Too funny yet heart warming,Mo'nique is too funny in this movie. But she is also real...Funny movie with a message too.
3,Palm VII device,An interesting device. However given the fact that wireless support for it ended sometime ago it makes it useful only as another Palm device.
5,Excellant for self study,"First work through Basics including the workbook, then A Summer Greek Reader (for practice with easy syntax and additional vocablary memorization), then this. After that read the Greek New Testament with A Reader's Lexicon to cut down on time spent thumbing through the lexicon. Start with the gospels or Acts."
5,A MUST for all Pavarotti and Opera lovers!,"I am a die-hard Pavarotti fan and an emerging opera lover. This CD has many of the great opera arias and most are performed by Pavarotti. In my opinion, London Records has a hit with Pavarotti's Opera Made Easy series.Those familiar with opera and those just beginning to sample opera; those who like Pavarotti as well as those who love all opera will enjoy this CD and it's collection companions!"
5,Great book...,"I bought this book for myself after loosing our first baby, Cameron at the end of my first trimester, just 3 weeks ago today. And, I must say that I did indeed cry while reading it, but the simple words of this book have already started healing the deep wounds in my heart. The illustrations are beautiful, and I would recommend this to anyone who has lost an infant."
4,Heartwarming,I bought this book for my sister who recently suffered a stillborn. She looks through it everyday and states that it helps her when she misses Emily.
5,RSI/CTD - the unacknowledged high tech epidemic,"Pascarelli & Quilter's book is an absolute must-read for all Health & Safety Coordinators and for all people working with keyboards. Practically-oriented, the authors have carefully outlined all of the common manifestations of cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) one encounters as a result of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs). The book is resourceful, an easy read, and covers the subject thoroughly. Jim Lovette RN, MA"
4,Fun game,Its old def not as fun on PC though ..you cant use a controller (i cant figure it out anyways)I played the whole series growing up
2,This is not a First Person Shooter .....,"It's a 3rd person shooter, something not mentioned in ProductDescriptions. Full marks to the developers for deception.It's also quite complicated [a 30 page manual], and if one of your AI dies, you lose.Only a limited number of saves per level.It's not my cup of tea at all."
3,Superwinch AC1500,"I received the item in a very timely manner, it was easy to install and easy to operate. Thank you Amazon I would recommend using Amazon to my friends"
2,Nice texture but broke after only five months,I bought this to replace a broken original band on my wife's ironman watch.It had a nice texture compared to the original's smooth surface.She liked it just fine but it broke after only five months.
4,"Great ideas, little guidance","I have to commend this book and recommend it. It really opens your eyes and makes you think about parenting in a whole new light. I really enjoyed the read and liked the amount of research that Kohn had to back up his claims. The only thing I would like to see changed is that he doesn't offer a lot of guidance. You read through the whole book really motivated and inspired to make a change and then I feel that he only lists a few bullet points of things you could try but without concrete examples. I think this book could benefit from some more practical examples of every day parenting. Otherwise, fantastic book!"
5,This positive parent loved it!,"Our family has, by and large, adopted most aspects of attachment parenting and, as our daughter grew, positive parenting. As I read this book, it felt as if Alfie Kohn had been inhabiting the recesses of my mind that were (to me) inexplicably torn about giving our daughter a treat when she used the potty. Whether you read Alfie Kohn, Magda Gerber, William Sears, or many others, respect for children remains key.As a Children's Librarian, I see many flavors of parenting every day. I also see the effects of parenting styles on unattended children on a daily basis. What helps me remain a caring professional even on rough days is respecting the young customers who need assistance. I've seen enough child reactions to silently hope for better from my own daughter, but this book has encouraged me to think about what I really want for her, why I want it, and how to allow her to become the best person she can be."
1,WHATEVER!!,"This book is great in theory but good luck putting into practice!!Some of his ONLY real advice was to let a child (while in public) ride out a temper tantrum. Well, what about kids you flail, bite, hit, throw, and do anything possible while having a tantrum....what then?There is nothing in this book I don't already do.Saying ""Good job"" is bad? Come on, lets all live in the real world!Somebody give me some REAL advice for the extreme situations!!"
4,Great singing!,"This is a controversial recording. Some people hate it and some love it. Resnik shows us a strong, independent and passionate Carmen. Mario Del Monaco is my favourite José! It is true that he is not in his best voice anymore here as this recording is from the 60's. But his José is still the most exciting portrayal of the role on record. The young Joan Sutherland is perfect for the role of Micaela and Tom Krause sings his role with excellent taste, as always."
1,Lip synced - very obviously not live music,Not a real live concert - almost entire thing is lip synced. If you want videos then it's fine. If you want a live performance look elsewhere.
3,Uneven start to a fine series,"""Hustle"" has become an excellent show, full of intricate plotting, sharp wit, and enjoyable ensemble acting. The first season, unfortunately, is seriously marred by a lack of originality. Both the first and last episodes are shameless ripoffs of ""The Sting."" When you have only six episodes, stealing the plots for two of them from the SAME movie is quite a con!However, three of the four remaining episodes (all but the weak second ep) are very good indeed. At its best, the show has the feel of a breezy ""Mission: Impossible"" with more interesting characters.If you're discovering this show for the first time, start with Season 2."
3,Fun story,I liked the Birthright setting as a game world.This book puts a little extra color to the landscape of the world.The main character is the chamberlain to the Prince who is thrust into a war by the death of his father.It is a very enjoyable read.
2,Not worth it,"For the price, I didn't get what I paid for. Not a lot of good fights at all. Too much talking and a lame ending. Haven't heard much about this so I wanted to see it. Now I wish I could have read some reviews on it."
4,Two great Jewish thinkers interpreted,Friedman's interpretations of the thought of Heschel and Wiesel are done with reverence and consideration. They do not however in my view attain a depth of perception which would fully bring out the value of both of these great peoples' thought.
2,DeLonghi DCF212T Drip,"I don't recommend this coffee maker. I have had it less than a year and it leaks, the non stick plate has pieces of the coating gone.The coffee pot has burned coffee from the coffee leaking in the back by the pause panel. I really liked the design and the quality of coffee that is brewed, but lasting under a year is unacceptable."
3,flood in the kitchen,"I bought my Mom this pot at Sam's. She loved it until one morning when she added water and came back a while later to find her kitchen cabinets and floor flooded with water from the unit. She tried again (thinking maybe she had overfilled it), this time setting the coffee maker in the sink. It again let the coffee water out everywhere. The coffeemaker now resides in the basement until we can decide what to do with it. We love the design, and it's less than a year old, but flooding the kitchen is not an option!.. Wish they would keep the front loading design but remake the waterflow process."
2,Loved it...until it leaked,"I bought this coffee maker because of the front loading reservoir design, which I do love. It fits perfectly under my cabinets and is a breeze to fill. It makes good coffee, though maybe not quite as hot as some may prefer. About six months after purchase, coffee began to leak out onto the warming plate, causing a huge mess and a horrible burnt coffee smell. Annoyed, but hoping to give the Delonghi another chance, I ordered a replacement basket. The problem appeared to be remedied for about a month, but the coffee maker soon began leaking again. When I called customer service, they claimed to have no other similar complaints, which I find hard to believe. Very disappointing experience, and very disappointing for a coffee maker with such seemingly great other qualities."
3,It quit working,I bought this coffee maker about two years ago. It quit working a week ago; the water would not come and I tried to clean the machine using Vinegar with out success. I like to convenience of front loading the water and coffee. I am thinking that I may buy it again; unless I find a better one similarly priced.
5,Great design,I hated having to move the coffee maker every morning so I decided to give this one a try. It is great! It is easy to pull the arm out and pour in water/add coffee. There is no moving the appliance and no spills. Coffee tastes great and auto-timer is wonderful.One slight con is that it seems to take longer to brew than my previous Gevalia coffeemaker.
1,"great in theory, but that's it","I loved the idea of pouring the water in the front but it only works in theory. My coffee cups are all different sizes, so I use them to accurately gauge the right amount of water and then pour the water in to the maker from the cup. The channel you pour the water in is only about 1 1/2"" wide. No matter how I pour, I miss the channel and the water goes everywhere. I even tried using a funnel once in order to get the water in the machine but that was ridiculous.My next problem was that it has a minimum of 4 cups of coffee. Even my biggest cup only comes in at 2 1/2 on their scale. So I ended up wasting coffee/water to get up to the minimum.So it's on a shelf, sitting unused."
1,Delonghi DCF212T - The WORST Coffee!,Does not heat the water enough to produce anything but VERY weak coffee. Complete waste of money. The front access design is great but the coffee is awful. Don't bother with this one.
1,nice design but.....,"While the design works very well with my kitchen space...the coffeemaker does NOT keep the coffee hot at all. It does stay on for about 2 hours however, it keeps the coffee lukewarm at best. I will be replacing this coffeemaker shortly and only using as a backup one when I have company and need to make more than one pot quickly to serve.Dissappointing!"
4,Replacement carafe,"I am very pleased with the DeLonghi coffee maker for all the reasons stated by others. But you may want to consider this before purchasing one. Because I have a penchant for breaking carafes, I decided to have a spare on hand. The only source that I could find is the company itself and the bottom line price is $32. For a pot that costs $50? This is my first and last experience with a DeLonghi product."
1,Leaks!,"I bought this a few months ago, recommended it to a friend too. After a month it started leaking down the back of the coffeemaker, burnt coffee smell every morning! Sent it back to DeLonghi and they replaced it less $9.50 shipping/handling. It started leaking again this week-2 months later! This time it will end up at the curb. My friend is having the exact same problem, we didn't even purchase from the same place. She returned hers and is waiting for her new one. She requested it after I told her my second one was working fine. Now it's not.It looks like it's a problem with the basket, because I used the old basket accidentally one time and it leaked all over."
1,BROKEN AGAIN!,"Bought it in December- it broke in January. Delonghi was very good at replacing it, just cut the cord and send it back- less $7.50 s+h. It'snow July and it's broke again... should I give it another try? The nice feature of being able to swing the front open to pour in the water, much easier than lifting the top and pouring it in. If only it wouldn't break again. ugh!"
5,Great Design!,"We decided to replace our $100 Kitchen Aid coffee maker with this model because our old one had serious design flaws and was starting to fall apart after less than a year. This appliance has a unique design that allows you to fill the coffee grounds and water without having to pull the machine out from under your low hung cabinets. This was always a problem with other brands we had. I love the pull out design! Secondly, it doesn't beep when it's done brewing, which if you have sleeping babies is a good thing. The sleek design, unique features and intuitive programing makes this worth the money. Good buy!"
4,Parker writes a solid novel,"Parker's ""California Girl"" is essentially the story of two families and the brothers of the two families who are raised in very different circumstances. The Vonn brothers are trouble while the Beckers are the suburban middle class family of the 60s. Parker follows the families including the death of the daughter in the Vonn family. In the book, Parker deals with various characters including Charles Manson, Richard Nixon, Timothy Leary and the whole Vietnam war issue.It's worth the read. It is a bit slow at times but it's a well written book with a great backdrop of the 1960s and two families who lives are intertwined."
3,Great book for your next vacation in Hawaii,"If you're planning a vacation in Hawaii, this historic novel is the perfect read while you're there. If you can get around the mediocre literary writing and editing, you can easily be transported back in time - literally time travel - with the help of several Hawaiin gods, Queen Ka'ahumanu, and a homeless lady from Waikiki Beach. The author very creatively weaves history, current socio-economic issues, and a sweet romance story together, keeping the reader engaged and wondering what happens next. It's a quick lesson on the ""who's who"" of Hawaiin Royalty during the reigns of Kamehameha I-IV (1800's). I especially enjoyed the use of Hawaiin words in context to give a more authentic flavor and appreciation for the local culture. This book taught me a lot more in 10 days about Hawaii than I would have otherwise learned from the mostly touristic resort destinations of the islands. And it left me hungry for more!"
3,First Person and Kiss fans only,"Kiss Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child is mildly entertaing first person shooter the graphics are decent the controls are allright using the 4 buttons as movement keys and the analog stick as your look mecanism. There is a smattering of Kiss music in the game and you get to see the characters develop as they find pieces of their armor. The single person mode is fun enough but the weapons aren't varied enough they should have put more in the game. There are 4 worlds one for each Kiss band member and 23 nemesis. What the dreamcast version of this game is missing is ANY KIND OF MULTIPLAYER online or otherwise, they rushed this title out without developing any multiplayer or online modes. Seeing how nicely the DC is handling online play this is just outrageous for a newly released fps, no excuses. This is why the title garners 3 stars its for die hard single player fps or die hard kiss fans although I am not sure that it will satisfy either."
3,"A lot of law, not much Internet","Overview: Not so much a book about the Internet as a 200 page intellectual property nutshell, this book is an outstanding resource for anyone who needs a refresher course in (or, for that matter, an introduction to) intellectual property. It falls short in providing substance on the legal issues as they relate to the Internet; instead, it hopes to acquaint the Internet user with intellectual property law. Buy this book if you are looking for a thorough I.P. primer; do not buy it if you are looking for a comprehensive treatment of legal issues on the Net.The full text of this review is online at:http://www.redstreet.com/readingroom/reviews/internetlaw.htm"
3,This series of games are losing its appeal,"The best civilization game was probably Civ II. Since then, the games' graphics have improved, yet the game play has deteriorated. Civ IV is no exception. The looks seems better, but the play is more or less the same as Civ III. The problem is that it takes a little too long to get to a stage where it is somewhat interesting. Overall, I find the play has become tedious, and this series of games have run its natural course. I would not buy another one of these Civilization games anymore."
5,Great No Matter How You Put It,"OK, I don't play on-line or with partners or anything. I don't have 1,000 patches, scenarios and I don't have Warlords. I simply enjoy the play of the game and each time I play I notice something new. What is amazing is the graphics. Roll the mouse button for closeups and the attention to the most minute detail is amazing.New resources, new ways to treat religion, new Wonders, new units - it is practically a completely new game. Bravo to Sid for yet another winner.So when is Civ V being introduced?"
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!!!,I have played CIV since version 1.0 and have loved the game.. so as soon as the game was available at the local store I picked up the copy.. also picked up the latest and greatest video driver so i could enjoy the game...Do not buy this game at this point!!! it does not work!!! you will end up rebooting your system after 2 or 3 moves!!!! nothing but frstration...The game needs to be taken back to the drowing board and completely redone...It will crash constantly and along with that crash your system ... does not matter what you do...!!!!!
4,Really great game!!,This game is so fun that I'm building a new gaming rig just to run it better and if that doesn't make you think Great game then I dont know what will!!! GO FOR IT!! TREAT YOURSELF!!
1,Civilization 4 - Civ 4,"I was unable to install this game properly due to my video card. This is a common problem with this game if you have an ATI video card. Check before you buy. Stupidity, Firaxis and shame on you Sid Meier."
1,The game is worst than the first version of its,"I played its first version-test of time more than 10 years ago and I found it is even worse than that.The graphics are bad: the interfaces are just like those generated by Microsoft office words.The game is time-consuming and boring.What I can remember after playing this game is clicking buttons to upgrade and move next term.I myself don't like reading books and I found reading a book is more enjoyable than playing this game.It shows no improvements on anything.Don't waste your money on the game! you will certainly find even reading a boring literature article is more fun than spending hours for clicking button to ""enjoy"" the game!"
1,Does Not Work,"I have a Gateway computer running at 3.56gb with a Pentium 4 processor and 500MB of memory and a built-in video card along with Windows XP. It was not until after the game was installed and ran the main intro that I was told that my system did not meet the necessary requirements. I have many games on my computer that are recent and this is the only one that would not work. Apparently it requires some sort of exotic, esoteric video card of which I am not willing to spend an additional $700 for just to play this one game.I won't buy anything with Sid Meier's name on it ever again"
3,hello,"This is a typical turn-based game. It took me some time to figure out how to play and think like the game.The little details are very interesting, such as, the UN and Leonard Nimoy's lending his voice to the game.I suggest getting the upgrade ""Warlords."" Make sure you update the upgrade though!I really don't know what to say anymore."
1,Beware,"After 9 hours of trying to install this game, I gave up. First, the game would freeze when I inserted the 2nd CD. Then, on the 11th try, it got past that error, only to delete the entire installation because of a ""C++ 7.1"" error. I found a work-around for that on a public website -- that took another 2 hours. Got past that problem, only to have the game completely freeze my system after installing patch 1.5.Obviously the game works for some people, but my advice is to try to install it the same day you buy it so you can return it if your experience turns out like mine. NOTE: this was not a problem with my computer, which is very high end."
2,Doesn't Work,"After purchasing this game I got it home to find out that it has so many bugs that the majority of people can't play it. Maps come up black, characters lack faces (only eyes and mouths show up) and dozens of other crashes and errors exists.This game was released prematurely without proper testing and the general public is being punished. Don't buy this game."
1,Do not buy this game,"Please do not buy this game. It is full of software problems(bugs) almost like BETA software. I've tested BETA software that is completely functional where this software game is not.On dialing the customer service 866 number to obtain support, a recording says your call is very important to us and please continue to hold, but you are placed on hold for about 5 minutes then the recording says all lines are busy and try again later or send email. Then you are HUNG up on !.I could list all the bugs I've found so far but what is the point. The game is basically unplayable."
2,Too bloated and slow.,"Nothing beats Civ II for speed of play and intuitive controls.CivIV is better than Civ III, but still way too slow. You're likely to die before you finish one of the bigger games. Even with a decent dual core processor and video card, the turns take way too long, even when you set the game up at fastest turn speed.If you actually like strategy rather than appearance, just buy/get a copy of Civ II.Civ IV is a waste of time and money. CIv simply gets bigger and prettier every release (and thus slower), but not more fun to play as it.People who say Civ III or IV are good games just don't know what they are yammering about."
1,Don't Buy Unless You Have A Brand New System,"Don't buy Civ IV. From what I've read, Civ IV is supposed to be a great game. However, because of the new 3D graphics features it will not run on systems more than a year or two old. I've spent days trying to upgrade my Dell Dimension only to discover that it cannot be done. From what I've seen elsewhere on the Net, quite a few people are having similar technical problems. I also had issues with the game crashing repeatedly. This game is not ready for prime-time, and the graphics are too demanding for most computers. I've already wasted $150 on upgrading my system trying to play. Please learn from my mistakes."
2,Don't do it,"I was a big fan of the Command and Conquer series, so I figured I'd enjoy this game. It's true, the graphics are great and there's a lot going on in the game, but I found the fun quickly expired as things became so redundant and nauseating. I enjoyed it for about a week before I couldn't deal with it anymore. The warfare aspect is totally unfulfilling. The ""warriors"" are all brain-dead and stand still while being hammered by the enemy. You cannot have coordinated attacks. It's one shot at a time, totally boring. Oh yeah, I can't even figure out how to uninstall it from my system. They don't provide a uninstall icon in the program file and I can't locate it in the ""add/remove"" programs tool.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game."
2,get the bugs out!,"this game would have been awesome if you could ever get it to play right on your pc, disc 2 is flawed, the first thing i had to do was download a patch for it which proves the game doesnt play right. if you have an older pc forget about it. i finally had to send this back to amazon for a refund. I had to go through a major ordeal just to get the program un-installed, the designers released this game to early and it is just a major pain in the ass just to try and play it, the other civ games are great! hope they get the bugs out!!

1,Don't Buy It,"I've now installed this game on 3 PCs. On 2 of them the terrain is black and the game is unplayable. On the best PC, the game is viewable but still unplayable. Civ4 is an unspeakable desecration to a great line of games.Some specifics: The map is just plain ugly and eye-straining. The screen floats and jumps around like playing a shooter game. You have to constantly look all over the screen to find pieces of related information. The right-click options (formerly a Civ game strength) are turned off by default and even when you re-enable them, they still aren't very useful.All the effort at trying to 'see' what's going on produces a gaming experience that is mentally exhausting and devoid of strategic thinking. Don't buy this game. They'll probably come up with some graphic patches for some of the hardware, but don't buy the game then either because it just isn't any fun."
4,Great Strategy Game,"The fourth installment of this great series has a number of changes and improvements over previous versions. Of course the basic concepts remain the same. I'm not going to repeat a lot of what's already been said about this game but I will say that if you are 1)interested in really good strategy games which require a lot of thought and planning, 2) aren't obsessed with the latest and greatest graphics, 3)have a reasonably long attention span then you should give Civ IV a try."
4,Meeker Review,I didnt know this game was a turn based game but its still fun. Some people like this kind of game.
3,Disappointment,"It was a let down from the earlier Civilization games. It is much harder to win and given the time frame for growth, the other civilizations seem to advance at an unrealistic pace. Also, some of the civilizations, for example ""Ethiopian"" and others are missing from this game.The 3rd series I think was much better as was the 2nd one."
2,Sid Meier's Civilization IV,"The graphics look great, but there are way too many problems with the graphics. Even with the maximum requirements on my machine, I have stuttering, slow play time and problems further into the game with loss of graphics entirely and crashes. Trying the fixes doesn't fix anything, just makes everything worse. And the patch didn't help a thing. I LOVED Civ III and had high hopes for Civ IV - but have been EXTREMELY disappointed. I'm with another reviewer. I wish they would backport some of the fun features to Civ III (primarily the suggestions and going straight to the subject city/object that is in need to movement & direction).Not worth the money it's being charged!"
1,Civ 3.5,"I had no issues playing the game as far as crashes and major bugs. With that said, this game is Civ 3 with better graphics. Right down to the space race win. There are many changes and tweaks to all phases of the game, but it is still the same as civ 3. I've seen expansion packs with more changes. I played one time. I doubt I will play again. A total disappointment."
2,Game Crashes,"The upgrades and overall design of this version of Civ are very good, but the game crashes every time I play. I have an Alien with 3.4ghz HD processor and 1MB of RAM. I have updated the drivers on my Nvidia GeForce FX5950 Ultra card drivers as recommended. I have patched up to the latest version (1.52). Unfortuantely, the game continues to crash.I agree with one of the reviewers here who said the game needed more QA before release."
1,Trying to make lemonade!!!!!,"My experience with this game has been absolutely horrible. I have an ATI Graphics card and Sound Blaster Audigy two very common components. Put simply the game won't start and it locks up. Support for this game is non-existent and when you call the help number you actually wait ten minutes on the phone before an automated message says that all the reps are busy please call back in 24 hours, ""24 HOURS!!!"", then hangs up. If you are lucky enough to get through they will tell you whatever they can just to get you off the phone. Whatever you do if your are gullible enough to buy this game and have to call support, do not let them say they will send you an email. DONT HANG UP THE PHONE!!. DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT or are looking for lemons!"
2,Civilization IV installation problems,"During installation process, it prompts me to put Disk 2. After doing so, the system promptly issues a catastrophic error. The installation process then crashes. According to numerous forums on this game, this has happened to many users and the cause is defective disk 2. I am in process of returning/replacing this game but that would take some time. Not a happy camper."
3,Goal-oriented and Thought provoking,"The game art is very good and the interface is very intuitive. There are certainly entertaining elements and some of the goals are amusing. Thinking ahead is important to the game and if you enjoy being a planner and a thinker this is probably right up your alley. It is certainly fun, and I spent hours enjoying it.However, I feel it lacks major replay value. I know some people have found it, but it has eluded me.I bought this game because I couldn't find a demo without a virus that destroyed my computer (that was fun). I'm glad I now know but I should have left it alone in the first place. But perhaps it's just not my cup of tea. Maybe it's hiding in multi-player."
3,LOVE CIV IV,"Of course, I'm addicted to CIV IV... but I don't like the cap on the number of turns you're allowed to take. The game would be perfect if you could play with unlimited turns. I downloaded all of the recommended patches and haven't noticed a problem yet."
1,"Musicalmente excelente, copia del disco original FATAL","Amanda Miguel es toda una leyenda y no se merece que su música se venda en copias tan mal hechas. Si usted es un admirador de esta gran cantante, tenga un poco de paciencia y espere a que sus discos originales sean re-editados de forma excelente. Si yo fuera Amanda Miguel demandaría a la compañía que produjo este cd de una forma tan mediocre y descuidada.giorgiopr"
3,Sort of OK,"I have used both Queen Helene Cholesterol with Ginseng and Queen Helene Cholesterol (the original conditioning cream) and the original cream works better for my hair. Therefore, I would recommend the original Queen Helene Cholesterol conditioning cream rather than Queen Helene Cholesterol with Ginseng. The delivery was fast, just to mention."
