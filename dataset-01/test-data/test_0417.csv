3,Fun but a bit fragile due to inflatable,"The Mega Mech R/C Robot 48 inch by Tekno is a fun product for kids ages 5-7, but takes a lot of time to blow up and space to move around. Once it gets going, the kids love it! But as it's an inflatable, it soon started tipping over where it stood and continued to lean no matter how much air in legs. Needs some support for it to function and be sturdy enough for longer play. The speech was great the first time, but with only 5 variations, it also soon grew old for the kids. For the price, it was a good deal, and if your little one loves to have control and RC figures, it will be a hit."
4,who ever heard of an inflatible robot?,"i bought this as a xmas present for my 25 year old brother and i tested it out. its way cool. not the most practical toy ever and i don't know about the durablility yet, but what's better than a 4 ft inflatible robot that you can drive?"
3,robot,"This robot is just okay it moves slow and has a few sentences, for the price its a good deal for smaller children"
4,Terrific Fun,Great toy...I wish I could afford more. The kids loved it to death...I wish I had bought more when it was on sale.
1,A mediocre product.,"When one considers the amount of data--photos, songs, animation, etc.-- which can be held on a CD-rom, it's shameful that this product is so sparsely outfitted.What we have here are some maps of Western Civ, and some questions to accompany them. Both the software and the historical material feel quite outdated and hackneyed, as if produced twenty years ago.Besides being unsophisticated, the material is classical in the sense that it overlooks the roles of everyday people, working classes, slaves, and immigrants, in favor of shifting borders, wars, and the like. Aren't we ready to teach our students better history?A big disappointment. They can do much, much more than this."
2,Best for younger babies,I made the mistake of buying this for my 13 month old -- she exhausted its possibilities within 5 minutes. It is best for MUCH younger babies.
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"This is one of the most disappointing soundtracks in the history of soundtracks. How could this summer's only movie worth seeing put out a soundtrack worth vomiting on?! I can't complain enough over how pathetic this soundtrack is. Leslie Carter?! ""All Star"" destroyed this movie for me. What possessed Smashmouth to cover ""I'm A Believer""?! Bad bad bad bad idea. Eddie Murphy did better. So can you. Skip this worthless jumble of pop trash."
4,you were maybe expecting Prince Charming?,"You could've realized the movie wasn't exactly for ALL little kids. It had a PG rating, not G. That's an indicator that maybe you should think twice, or see it for yourself first. There were some minor bad words in the movie, so they allowed the soundtrack to have some too, no? and did listening to the soundtrack make your kids start swearing themselves? Doubt it. So enjoy the music. I thought the music was really fun and well picked out for the movie, and LOVED the movie itself."
1,A warning about this CD,"The beautiful and haunting song ""Hallelujah"" is featured prominently in ""Shrek"" (which is very good, as you probably know already).The song is performed by John Cale. However, the soundtrack offers a different and wholly inferior version. I can't understand this to save my life. Shame on the record exec. who decided to do it to us.If you would like to own the John Cale version, I believe it is featured in the soundtrack to ""Basquiat"" and in a Leonard Cohen tribute album released a few years ago (Cohen wrote ""Hallelujah"")."
1,Wrong songs,"I did not buy this, because I already have the wonderful John Cale version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah (from the equally great I'm Your Fan album, a tribute to LC). I also have Leonard's live and studio versions. It's a great song. Everything else is throw-away pop. Why they replaced the John Cale version I can't imagine, unless they could not get rights or are promoting Rufus. Despite the wording in the review about this song, Rufus did not pen this, Leonard Cohen did. Do your homework please!"
1,grrr...,"Once again I'd like to thank the brilliant minds in charge of making such decisions for crafting an outstanding musical score for a movie (well, with the exception of All Star), and then not releasing it. Instead they decided to release a bunch of songs easily acquired elsewhere (""All Star"" and ""Bad Reputation"" just to name a few.) I'm just glad it was my roommate that made the mistake of buying this CD, and not me."
3,needs the full score to be it's best,"This CD definitely needs more of the score on it as it was fantastic, despite this it's still a good CD to listen to. I also had trouble identifying whereabouts in the film some of the tracks had come from but the quality was still good so not too many complaints. i would wonder though how much better this soundtrack could've been if it had the score on it as only 1 piece of it is by no means enough to satisfy some great work.Overall the music is good and it fits the film nicely but i'd have liked the full score and less free use of music by the producers. oh well...could've been far worse i guess but also far better!"
4,"excellent, but","great, memorable tunes from an exceptional movie. sound quality is a little spotty, but not so bad as to ruin the fun"
3,quit complaining,"I keep seeing all these people complaining about how John Cale's ""Hallelujah"" was not included on the soundtrack- and how Rufus Wainwright's version was instead. It's the only good song on the soundtrack. I'm sure you already know that Leonard Cohen wrote it originally, and it's been covered by MANY people, the late Jeff Buckley in particular. It's a beautiful song and Rufus is a talented musician. If you can't appreciate it, don't listen! Buy the Leonard Cohen tribute album if you want the John Cale version. But if you love it as much as you say you do I'm sure you already own it- right? I'm sure."
3,Fun...but it could have been better!,"Last month I had the privellge to see an advance screening of ""Shrek."" And the first thing I noticed was the excellent score. So I finally bought the soundtack, looking forward to the 1 score song it has, and I'm kinda dissapointed. The 1 score song is great, although it's short. But there are a lot more themes missing - although track 4 is my favorite theme just with lyrics slapped on it. But the other songs are fun! If you like so-called ""soundtracks"" filled with songs, I recommend it. P.S. Track 4, 10, 11, and 13 are great!"
2,Warning: Doesn't Contain Score - Lyrics Questionable,"Parents should be forewarned that this CD contains questionable lyrics for kids in some of the songs. Also, fans of background scores should note that only one cut from the score is on the CD. Shrek had an excellent score, but DreamWorks failed to include it here."
3,Fun CD,"But missing the score and a few other tasty tidbits from the movie, like the Dulac song. I am not griping too much though, because I understand they are releasing a companion CD soon with those. Overall, this CD makes a good one to keep in the car for those long drives when you need something a bit bouncy."
3,wierd song selections....one true gem.,"Since I was only buying this for the gorgeous Leonard Cohen song ""Hallelujah"" (sung by one of my favorites, Rufus Wainwright), I can't say much about the rest of it except for ""Bad Reputation"" sounds EXACTLY like the Joan Jett/Blackhearts version, and I'm sick of ""Allstar"" and Smash Mouth. Maybe I'll review it again later. Ba-Ha Men bite!"
2,"The movie may be good, but the music is sucky","This is the perfect CD for taking a nap to. It's mostly full of slow pop and rock. If you're a fan of this type of music, I recommend this CD, but if not, don't buy it. There are only a few good tracks. All Star, Bad Reputation, I'm A Believer, Stay Home. And I don't enjoy buying a CD that only 1/3 of it is good. So, I wouldn't buy it, if I were you."
5,great,love it! We've been playing it almost everyday since we got it. the kids love it. And so do the adults!
1,Someone's mixed up a bit,"Hallelujah wasn't penned by Rufus as stated in the description - It was written by Leonard Cohen. This might be a great soundtrack if you like the movie, but someone at Amazon didn't do their research when listing this one."
2,"Is this a soundtrack, really?","So disappointed that the artists used in the movie did not appear on the soundtrack, i.e. Hallelujah and Bad Reputation. I bought the soundtrack because I liked the music in the movie and now I don't even get to hear the same versions. Gone are the days when a soundtrack is just that, all the music from the movie. Now we get just some of it, and not always the artists featured in the movie. Is this just a way to promote favored artists?? Shame on Shrek for a bait and switch!"
5,Great non-stick mini loaf pan!,I actually used this pan the day I received it and I couldn't be any happier with it.The mini loaves fell from the pan when I inverted it over a cooling rack. Perfect!!
5,"A little of this, a little of that...","A dash of Holden Caufield, a sprinkle of Ignacious Riley, mix together, bake for one hundred or so pages, let cool and enjoy the warmth and humor of Charlie Drop.If I liked it, you will too. Or it's your ass."
1,to big a risk of not getting water out,I bought one of these and then found out that there is a large risk of not getting all of the water out or not fully circulating the antifreeze. Marine mechanics and the dealers are not recomending this method they recomend to draing the block and fill it with anti freeze. There were cases of cracked engine blocks using this method. I had to return it. I cant take the risk.
5,Great toy!!,"I got these for my kids (6,2, and 6 months) for Christmas and they love them!!! Would definitely recommend them to family and friends."
5,Great Blocks - Made in the US,These are really nicely designed blocks that take a lot of abuse from my toddler. The animals pictures have nice detail. Very sturdy. Made in the US
5,The very best block set there is!,"These ABC blocks by Uncle Goose are the best made blocks you will find anywhere. I looked everywhere to find blocks for my 15 month old. Most are for 3 and up because they are too small and too destructable. Not these blocks! These are 1.75 inches each and have 100% safe paint for babies and up. My 15 month old chews on everything and she was not able to bite the paint off of these blocks, like she was easily able to with most other blocks on the market that I returned! The animal carvings on the blocks are really nice. They have numbers, A - Z and 27 animals for toddlers to look at. My child loves playing with these and stacking them up then knocking them down. I wanted to be sure she had these blocks for her 1st birthday. You can't go wrong with this classic toy. It is excellently made and very fun! A must have for all children ages 1 and up."
1,The book is not acceptable,"The book looked interesting and the recipe seemed creative at the first glance. I have tried Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies, Split Pea Soup and Curried Potato-Spinach Soup. The measurements were all wrong in these recipes. I am an experienced cook and I was able to salvage or modify the recipe on my own. The book appears to be put together very quickly without anybody testing the recipes. I am very disappointed."
4,"Decent, but small","This toy is very cute and fun for a little kid. However, I was a little deceived on the size. The seller acutally didn't say anything about the size, so I was disappointed it was so small. About 6-10 inches. Just needs to list the size so buyer will know what they are really getting."
2,another toy for the garage sale,"This toy was fascinating to my boys for only about an hour. Not long afterwards, it stopped talking, and, since that's the only interactive thing that it does, it hasn't been played with since."
5,Bought,"This was bought as a Christmas gift for our nephew.., he is a huge Cowboys fan and since it is Osha approved he may wearit at work"
3,It won't last.,"I bought this for my 9 yr. old son to practice throwing and catching. When I saw it at the store, I thought it was just like the one I loved as a kid and lasted at least three years. I was disappointed that the netting was held in place by plastic ""grippers"", not springs, thus the only ""bounce"" to return the ball when thrown was from the nylon net itself. This required that you had to throw the ball very hard at the net to get it to return so you could catch it. A good pitch, thrown near the top of the net, will cause the whole thing to fall over, even with the anchors secure in the ground. This throwing force causes a lot of stress on the frame and grippers. After a day of use, the plastic grippers began breaking off and within a week of throwing practice, a plastic frame connector broke. Now I am looking for something stronger.This product is probably more useful for a younger player who uses nothing heavier than a tennis ball."
2,Could've been fun if it was made more durable,"I bought this for my 8 year son for Christmas last year. Being a huge baseball fanatic, he could hardly wait til Spring to put it together and play with it.Within the first few minutes after we put it together, the frame fell apart. The only way it was usable was if you placed it exactly where you needed it, reconnected the frame pieces and tossed the ball gently into the net. Any forceful throw would cause the frame to wobble and fall apart. It was very frustrating for my son not to be able to use the net without it falling apart. For me, it was very disappointing and a definite waste of money."
3,gift for father,the product arrived in a well wrapped box and items inside were not damaged. the jelly was a gift for my dad. he loved this!!
5,My Favorite Book in the WORLD!,"I love this book. I have read it a hundred times and could read it a hundred more. This is a must for evryone,ages 1 to 100. You don't have to be a kid to LOVE these stories.Cynthia Logan"
5,A great book for kids of all ages!,My son and I enjoy reading and rereading each and every story in this book. This is great entertainment at it's very best.
5,BEAUTIFUL!!,"such a stunning book, filled with the classic stories of Winnie-the-Pooh. It's absolutely worth the money, and my daughters truly enjoy listening to the funny tails of Winnie and his friends!"
5,Top literature.,Winnie the Pooh is a classic child favorite. With amazing character and a great attitude he goes on many adventures with his friends to take on many life lessons. This is a very special book for all to enjoy!
3,Ehh,Im a sophomore in honors English. The book was easy to comprehend but lacking (in my mind) a strong interest.
4,Good Pastoral Aid,"I have this on kindle, As a pastor I am finding that kindle books make excellent sources without carrying a large volume of material from place to place."
2,"Unsatisfying, overall","I bought this book with great hopes--it had been reviewed well here and elsewhere, and the Victorian pastiche is a favorite form of mine.I found, however, that this book was almost completely unreadable. The main character was tiresome at best, an utter blank at worst. Too much energy was expended in forcing rather outdated Freudian notions of gender and sex, and one got the sense, correct or no, that the author was a good sixty years behind on current debates on the subject.Ultimately, I lost so much interest that I was unable to finish the book. It does, however, make a handy hammer for those times when my bed frame begins coming loose."
1,"Interesting, Then Tedious, Then Bizzare","I read 267 pages in, checked other reviews to see if it was worth finishing, and quit. The premise of this book (an infant boy rescued and raised as a girl by a psychologically disturbed Father) is interesting, but as the infant grows toward manhood, I found the book hard to read. Hard to read in that it describes the main character pleasuring his Uncle (before he discovers the differences between males and females) and then pleasuring his cousin as a sick means of retaliation against the family (after he knows his sexuality, but is still dressed as a female). Obviously, there would be some sexual confusion and possibly promiscuity after being raised in such a situation, but truth be told, the author took it much too far for the time period. I found these scenes particularly disturbing and did not see them coming. Overall, I was very disappointed and wish I would have known there were such graphic descriptions of sexual aggression in the book."
2,Stand on Reason,"Let's quit relying on allies in the sky to justify our ethical principles. Instead, let's be rational grownups of the 21st century. For a more cogent analysis...not to mention one that is better written, see Michael Berumen's Do No Evil: Ethics with Applications to Economic Theory and Business"
2,A weak debut . . . with 3 or 4 great songs,"How did this band get pegged as a Pearl Jam rip-off? I don't hear it. The best song on this album, Plush, is better than anything Pearl Jam ever recorded, so the comparison seems strange. The rest of the album is a bit of a let-down. Sex Type Thing, Piece of Pie, Dead and Bloated, and Crackerman are great songs, but too one-dimensional. The rest of the songs are forgettable, even the ones that became radio hits. STP would go on to make at least three more albums better than this one. This is a wobbly start. You can tell the band likes to play heavy metal Kiss-type songs, but that's it. Later on, they would make sure that every song on the album is a winner. This time, half of the tracks are filler."
1,To the idiot below me,"""And how do you link Nirvana to Jimi Hendrix? You obviously know very little about either artist when you link the blues-driven, entrancing riffs of Hendrix with the 3-chord grunge rock licks of Nirvana. Hendrix was never told by his management to limit his songs to 3 chords... and if he had been""He wasn't comparing Nirvana's music to Hendrix's, stupid - He was comparing their impact only, maybe you should read before you respond, stupid. He clearly stated their music was nothing alike, stupid."
5,Opening Salvo of a War on Grunge,"With Core, Stone Temple Piltos fired the first shot in a war on grunge. At first blush, STP may have sonic similarities to Nirvana, Soundgarden, and maybe even the Screaming Trees. If that is what is in your head, listen to this CD a few times consecutively and then pop in a Led Zeppelin CD or a Doors CD. You'll find STP closer to Zeppelin than Nirvana. The musicianship of these men is unquestionable when one compares the original songs here with acoustic, altered versions on Storytellers or Unplugged. Nature has a way of weeding out the weak. The ability of STP to adapt their songs for alternative settings speaks to their comfort level with softer, gentler music with lots of light and shade."
4,Songs are Good,Stone Temple Pilots come off as a band trying to cash in on the grunge phenomenon. What they have going for them is that their songs hold their own with some of the better grunge songs. This elevates STP from a rip-off to a band that should get some notice. This is an album that should be in your collection. After this though they started to craft their own sound which makes their other albums worth getting too.
5,best album ever,This is the first song that I bought as soon as I started my kindle fire. It is still the only one that I have
2,2 and a half,"This album has some great songs, but the rest are just terrible. The only ones worth listening to are those that have been played on the radio. (""creep"", ""plush"", ""wicked garden"" and ""sex type thing"") Those are all great songs, but the rest of the album is hardly listenable. And those who criticized STP for copying other bands were partially correct. Well, at least with this album. They developed their own sound with their next three, but let's face it ""creep"" is a very good Nirvana imitation, and ""Plush"" does sound quite a bit like Pearl Jam. STP are great, but this album isn't. If you want some good STP, try any of their later cds. Purple is probably the most listener friendly, so check that one out first."
3,Great but arrived with a few dents,I needed the pans to mix fruit cakes ad other foods of large amounts.They are great but arrived with a few dents.
5,Lots of info in a graphic format,This is a great book in a small package. Graphic icons convey useful information that is understandable at a glance. Excellent illlustrations. Good for beginner or intermediate fern student. I use it as a supplement to text-heavy fern guides.
5,I could not put this incredible book down!,"I think that this is one of the best books that I have ever read! I could not put it down! Now, I am only 11, and I can't stay up too late, but when I was reading this book, I stayed up until past midnight just to finish reading this book! It can be a little scary at times, so I suggest to read this book in the daytime, so you won't get freaked out. Overall, I would say this book is a definite 2 thumbs up!!!!!!"
3,The so-so book,"Karen Connors, a normal girl from New Mexico, finds out that she has physic powers. Suddenly, she is hired by Officer Wilson to find a missing girl. After searching for days, they found the girl dead. Following the break up with her boyfriend, dreams about the girl haunt Karen. At the daycare where Karen works, a mysterious person kidnapped some babies. She and Officer Wilson set out to find the captured babies. Read this book to find out the solution to this mystery.The book, The Third Eye, was a fair book. It had a lot of suspense and drama, which I liked, but it lacked humor and amusement. Lois Duncan did a great job describing the characters and the plot. However, the book sometimes would rush to another setting without warning, so sometimes leaving the reader confused. Despite these things, most mystery readers would possibly like The Third Eye."
2,Splitting at the seams.,I bought this pad b/c it is so much prettier than any of the others that I have found. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 for that reason. I have washed it about every other week for the past 3 months and quite a few seams are coming apart. It's patchwork just like any other quilt in my house that has been washed tons of times... but after a dozen washings it is falling apart. The seams are poorly stitched and it does not withstand the washing machine very well. A highchair pad is going to need frequent washings and should be much higher quality. I wouldn't waste your money.
1,No more has to be said than this:,"The thing has no safety straps. Ask any doctor, any child safety expert, anybody, this has got to have safety straps. Say the child doesn't like the tray close, and say suddenly your 2 year old tries to run outside or do something dangerous and you have to run after them. When you got back, your child could very well be standing up or have even fell. Even on carpet, that fall would be devastating. Now, does anyone really want to explain to a doctor that the child has a concusion because there was no safety strap on the highchair? Nah. Kids get in enough trouble without necessary risks. After all, would you put your 6 month old in the bouncer, on a table, without strapping them in? Nah. And trust me, it ain't that different.Plus, the thing does come apart. I know someone who got this for a shower gift, before she could even use it, juice was spilled on it. She washed it, and there ya go.I don't like the pattern either."
5,Cute bear - good price,"Bought this for the girlfriend, and she went insane for it. Very good price for it, and it's very soft. Recommended."
3,short appearence,"The video is quite good , whenever we see SEGOVIA playing or talking about his live or the history of the guitar, but unfortunatly not enough- we could have done without watching sceneries of Spain or the donkey walking in the country side !I would like myself find a copy of the other video showing SEGOVIA playing : it is a 52 minute film from Christopher Nupen called "" The Song of the Guitar "" It was printed on laser disc, but I wonder if it is available on VHF or DVD ?Thank you for your answerGuy"
5,Food Pharmacy,"Many times mankind will take whatever pills their Doctor gives them without question, with this book we fine mother natures best treatment for what ever the problem is comes from plants, your kitchen, and common sense. It's less expensive that a office trip to the doctor, lab tests and the like. well worth the waite and price for peace of mind. GOOD READING!Food Pharmacy"
5,Incredibly Moving,Simply Raw is one of the best films I have ever seen. It beautifully illustrates the incredible trans-formative power of nutritional healing. Anyone who wants to learn how the proper diet and wellness plan can stop and reverse chronic diseases like diabetes should see this film. One of the people in this documentary is bound to remind you of yourself or someone you know.
5,Must See!!! I know someone who kicked diabetes after watching and doing what they said,"If you have diabetes get this movie. If you know someone who has diabetes give this movie to them as a gift and watch it together. If you want to know how to get off insulin and be diabetes free within 30 days, GET THIS MOVIE. I already gave my copy to a co-worker and after following a stick raw diet they beat their diabetes, no lie, I have nothing to gain besides a smile and a hug :) Get this movie, then ship it to a friend and have them ship it to a friend and so on. Get the word out that the answer is NOT pills and shots, it's simply changing what you eat. BUT, if you work within the $150 billion a year diabetes profiting system, don't get this movie, it will make it difficult to rest your head at night. Peace!"
3,okay,"The sight of the people doing the study was disgusting. The doctor and the workers have greasy stringy hair and appear to have not bathed in a month. They wear wool hats for some reason, probably to hide their hair. They are all way too skinny and look very unhealthy.Outside of that turnoff I did find the experiment of interest. I am not a diabetic nor do I want to become one so that is why I watched it. The information was useful and definitely reason to think."
5,Yum Yum Yum,"I love this stuff! I have a sensitivity to honey (and it's a little strong tasting anyway). The agave nectar has the consistency of honey, so it can be substituted 1:1 in recipes. I use it most in smoothies and on pancakes instead of syrup (the glycemic index is lower), but I'm starting to bake with it a bit. Still trying to figure out how to substitute it for white sugar, but I'm getting there. One of my friends and I usually split a case...makes it a lot less expensive than buying a bottle at a time at the health food store."
5,ARGUABLY THE OPTIMAL NATURAL SWEETENER,"Att: brown rice syrup, barley malt syrup, sorghum molasses, raw honey, millet malt syrup, maple syrup, fruit juice concentrate:There's a new sheriff in town when it comes to natural, low-glycemic sweetners, and its name is AGAVE!First and foremost, it tastes great! Will rescue the taste of anything.Add to that: scientific research reveals it is low on the glycemic index,digests like a long-chain polysaccharide, can prevent cavities, can be used hot or cold.The price has come down into the affordable range.A no-brainer"
3,Not a deal,"After purchasing this product online, I found the same exact product in a local grocery store for considerably less money. This item in a 12 pack cost .32 per ounce delivered. I can buy it at Trader Joes for .25 per ounce. Needless to say, I was very disappointed!"
5,Fun & lifelike,"This is a really fun toy! My two year old son and four year daughter love this toaster. The two pieces of toast pop up, but the toaster does not require batteries. Yea!! Only the lever on the toaster is operable, the other knobs do not move. It is really cute and I would buy it again."
5,My favorite CD in a growing collection,"I really liked the movie ""The Blues Brothers"" not only because it was funny, but because the music was terrific. Most of the album was taped live from Los Angeles, and the rest is from the Blues Brothers original soundtrack. Not only were the Blues Brothers themselves good, but they were also great with Ray Charles singing ""Shake Your Tailfeather"". The best tracks on this CD, in my opinion, would be ""Gimme Some Lovin'"", ""Sweet Home Chicago"", and ""Shake Your Tailfeather""."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF CASH!,Complete disappointment!! And we bought TWO for our two boys!!! THATS ALOT OF WASTED CASH!!!!
2,one broken piece on arrival,one piece was broken on arrival..it is not what I expected but I think the 3 year old will find it amazing as a night light
1,Disappointing,"My son was thrilled to receive this for Christmas and wanted to use it for a nightlight. The three AAA batteries don't even make it through one night. When I tried to contact the manufacturer, they were difficult to reach and never responded to my email. Very disappointing for mother and child."
1,Didn't even last 30 minutes!,We purchased this for my son's birthday and were excited to encourage his love for space. Within 30 minutes he was in tears as we did not have the specialized screw driver required to install the batteries in the hand held light. Getting past this we got everything else working...waited until it was dark...put on the story CD and before it was finished playing the switch and light broke. The toy was useless and really dissapointed my son.
2,Garbage - Skip this one!,"This planetarium is just a light bulb which reflects a black shadow with barely visible names on your ceiling. It does not glow in the dark and the light is so bright that you can't even use it for a night light. I have nothing positive to say about this, besides the educational CD that comes with it is good."
3,Never Surrender,"First off, this movie is not for everyone. Hardcore MMA fans will be stocked with disappointment. And not for any kids under 18. This movie should have been rated X, under Softcore Porn.Big name MMA fighters head the front of the cover, but the main actor is Hector Echavarria. And if you haven't noticed yet, he's also the Director, Producer, and Writer. Now that's a really big mistake in my book.This movie was enjoyable for me. Even though the fight scenes were a real disappointment. No realism. Everything was so fake. Their movements were so slow. It was plan laughable. Basically, I was saying WTF, after the first few minutes. But then I cleared my mind, trying to be open minded, thinking that this was only a movie. And that I was watching a bad acting softcore porn movie with some underground fight scenes in it. That's when I started to enjoy the movie.So beware before buying or renting this movie."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,this seriously has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen! thats about an hour and a half of my life i'll never get back! you'll see better acting in a porn movie than you will on here thats for sure! As soon as the movie was over i trashed the dvd! do yourself a favor and forget this movie ever even came out on DVD! dont be fooled by the cover like i was!
3,I would not buy again,"This slide is marketed for a one year old but is too hard for them to climb. There should be steps instead of the tiny ""rocks"" for them to climb. My daughter is very agile and she really cannot get up on this unless we help her. I am returning it and buying a slide with steps."
3,"Daughter loves it - but slide is too steep and ""rock wall"" should be stairs","My daugher loves playing with the wheel at the top, but I think the slide is too short and steep. She is a bit afraid of it, but she generally likes other slides. Also, instead of stairs, there is a ""rock wall"" - in my view this is age inappropriate. It should be stairs. My 18mo daughter has a lot of trouble getting up the ""rock wall."""
4,Looking for Painting Music,"I was at a certain record store, trying to avoid the people on the next stool competing for some sort of a public display of affection award, when I slapped on the headphones and picked 'Blue Merle'. Reminds me of dogs. I like dogs.Normally, I jet from one track to the other, rapidly making decisions like... hate it, hate it, hate it, too poppy, too girlie.... but I listened to the first song all the way through... and then I listened to the second song all the way through, and then I knew that this CD was my new family. I clutched it close like a new puppy.I brought it into my sacred painting studio space. This space is reserved for inspiration and hard work. Blue Merle definitely qualifies in those categories."
2,One or possibly two songs are good,"Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut ""Lucky To Know You."" ""Seeing Through You"" is all right, too. Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like ""Lucky To Know You."""
1,shameless rip-off of coldplay,I am amazed that no one else is appalled at the fact the this band is a complete copy of Coldplay. Where's the originality?
2,Overrated - and obfuscated,"I disagree with other reviewers. I bought this book knowing C/C++ and Unix very well - and expecting to pick up Win32. I was very disappointed. The writing is not clear, it is not well ordered or well presented, it is huge and expensive but somehow doesn't cover many important topics (Personally I think the author bulked it up by putting every single line of code he can in there, even if that line has been repeated in 3 earlier programs). You would be far better off getting Win32 Programming by Rector/Newcomer - I did and have never looked back and now I know Win32 very well. Not only does that book teach Win32, it shows how to do it and keep your code clean. Stay away from Petzold's book."
5,Great book,"This book is great! No other book for windows programming has explained source codes of a book in such details. As a programmer, the best way of learning is reading codes. Unlike many windows programming books, the text in this book is relevant to source codes. This is a truely great book for both experienced and new windows programmers. You should try its source codes on your compiler. I only think the author could mention how to use MS Visual studio IDE run and debug his programs without using makefiles. It works like this: (1) Create a new project as Win32 application in Visual studio IDE. give it a name. (2) insert the .c file into the Win32 project. (3) compile and run in IDE. One can debug the codes in IDE easier."
4,Almost perfect.,"This book is definately one of a different crop.It is not so intermediate that the simple beginner would cower before it, yet it is not so basic that it should be a beginner's first read.This book essentially picks right up from a programmer who is comfortable with C (or C++, but the core is C based) and starts the process of introduction to the Win32 API. While gradual enough that those who prefer a slower pace can follow, it is quick enough to keep the attention of the more fluent programmers.The good sides are the fact this text introduces the foundations in a very crisp and clear manner while maintaining the reasoning behind the structure. Each step consitantly builds upon the former.The down side is the fact the latter half pushes more emphasis over the graphical side of the Win32 api, than it does the functionality of Win32.Another point that would be appreciated in a 6th edition would be some kind of chart or quick reference index."
5,Works for me,"This book works very well for me. It presents the topic clearly and readably. It tells me what I want to know, and I mostly understand it on the first reading. It has lots of tutorial examples, very good. I am skipping around, finding what I want when I want it, modifying many of the example programs to try things out, and having a very good time.These reviews vary a lot, I think, because of the reviewers' varying expectations and experience levels, so it might be useful to characterize this reviewer:I'm a total newbie to Windows programming. My 17 years of programming includes essentially no GUI PC software, mostly embedded microcontroller firmware and MS-DOS hardware drivers, and Apple_II way back when. I already knew how multitasking works, and I had a smattering of Macintosh Toolbox exposure eons ago. This book fills the gap perfectly for me."
4,"Good book, but the code needs comments","My only gripe about this amazing book is that the source code is not well documented. At times he does a few tricky things that would be much easier to understand if there were a few lines of comments in the code.Other than that, it is a wonderful book that any computer science student who is doing windows programming will find useful."
5,Shocked....So good..best book EVA!!!,ok where to start...im a 15 year old who had been doing C for awhile now around 4 months...and i thought i would give API a goso i bouht this book along with another win32 api book.i had a look at the other one first because it was smaller and i was shocked at how hard it seemed..nearly gave up :( .so i opened up this book and had a read and this book makes it seem so clear and simplei would recommend it to any one wanting to learn win32 api.it is extremely well detailed..has no mistakes yet and is well worth the money5 stars from me
4,Great foundation book,"This is a very good book to build your win32 foundation with. But it is rather outdate if you want to make use of the latest windows os and with vista coming out, a new edition needs to be published."
3,Fun overall but...,This is a fun toy for our 5 year old. The Tekno pony acts like a real horse - she even gets mad. The only down side is the packaging for this product. Very wasteful use of plastics - the case is very nice but can't be re-used. Extremely difficult to get the horse out of the case.
5,EXCELENT,I gave this as a gift to both my son and son-in-law. They both reacted the same way. First word....WOW!!!!! It was out of the package and examined in seconds. They are both very handy guys and thought this was the perfect answer to any emergency.
5,Cool Gadget Great Product,Excellent product. I gave these away as groomsman gift at my wedding and they were a hit. They are also the perfect size to fit in your wallet as they are just thicker than a credit card.
5,This is pure genius!,"Vangelis' creativity is absolutely unparralled in this genre, especially with this album (along with Bladerunner). He is at his best when he is creating music for films. This is not a bunch of similar-sounding New Age mumbo-jumbo, it is rich, variant, and soul-captivating. I don't have enough positive things to say about this work."
3,a bit disappointed,"I ordered this item based on the gushing reviews of other consumers. While the title track really kicks, the rest of it is insipid and bland. I would have given less than 3 were it not for that track. To make matters worse, I found that piece of music in an anthology of inspirational music. My advice is save your money and look for the one great piece elsewhere."
5,Love It!,"I heard the first track of this CD on the radio, checked the radio station's playlist to find out what it was, found this CD available via Amazon, and immediately sent for it. As soon as it arrived I played the entire CD start to finish, found the various tunes going through my head the rest of the day, and a day or 2 later played it from start to finish again. I love it. Now I want to rent the movie, which I had never even heard of. The music is modern music made to sound old, circa 1492. I really love it."
4,Excellent great understanding of homeopathic remedies,"I stayed up all night to finish this book, great understanding of characters and of nature medicine and the commuity lack of understandingWell done"
5,Alternative medicine meets Vermont,"Chris Bohjalian is a truly amazing storyteller. Once again, he has created a book of wonderfully quirky characters, lovingly (and with humor) portraying life in his adopted home of Vermont. In this book, the story puts in reader in the position of judging a situation in which alternative medicine goes head-to-head with modern medicine, leading to legal repurcussion. Add in a conflicted love interest, and you have this thought-provoking novel."
4,Excellent! Couldn't put it down.,"I thought this book was even better than Midwives - I didn't know anything about homeopathic medicine before reading this book and wasn't particularly interested in it, however Bohjalian made me want to learn more about it with each page of his book. Was sorry that the book ended!"
2,Disappointment,"So disappointed. I couldn't put down Midwives and thoroughly enjoyed Buffalo Soldiers. Both had realistic characters and thought-provoking situations. But this story felt like another author's work, or pehaps one of his earlier works. I even double checked the print date. Sure, the well-developed ethical dilemmas are there, but his main character was so pathetic and unrealistic. Still can't believe Bohjalian had the widower fall so hard and fast for a woman he barely knows, and I could do without the smutty description under the Xmas tree. Chris, you can do so much better!"
1,Where Is It?,"I ordered this book four weeks ago, and everyone's acting like I've gotten it----NOT!I'm po'd--this is rediculous. Did they ship it by carrier pidgeon?"
3,Lavender is the new white?,"I take long baths nightly, so I need a pillow that will be both comfortable and durable. Others mildewed and/or fell apart after a few months of nightly usage. This pillow, with its rubbery texture appears, for all intents and purposes, to be fairly mildew resistant.However, as another reviewer noted, the pillow is not actually white. In fact, after getting wet, it actually appears very lavender (though the lavender color fades a little upon drying).Also, the pillow is not particularly thick or cushiony, just so you know."
5,The perfect bath pillow,I love this pillow. No inflation means it is always the right shape and lots of suction cups make it stay securely in place. It works for both my tall husband and myself.
5,High Quality,"I purchased these corbels for our kitchen refurb project and they work great. They are solid, beautifully constructed and stain well. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,A blow to responsible governments everywhere,"A pessemist work which focuses in the most complicated legal tangles possible in a democracy, Michener's biased essay collection essentially endorses totalitarian orders. With essay after carefully chosen essay blasting the corruption and red tape associated with some young democracies, it may as well be communist propaganda. I will keep this one safely at the back of my library, well out of view."
4,Vice City is sure to be a great game,I really like the Grand Theft Auto series and so far every GTA game has been superb. This one I imagine will be better than my current favorite GTA3. This one will take place in the 1980's and have some famous Hollywood personalities. The new movements you can use with your character is a great feature. I am sure this game will be excellent like the other GTA's.
1,Grand Theft Auto Vice City,"I mistakenly got this game for my sons at Christmas. My daughter told me that part of the game showed women being raped in cars. Ofcourse I won't let my sons play the game. What's wrong with our world that this is considered entertainment. When I told one of my son's friends the reason I wouldn't let him play the game he responded by saying "" Oh yeah well they really want it and it's in cars so you can't see it"" Need I say more!"
1,Overrated piece of crap,"I give this game minus 100 along with GTA 3. Why is everyone like this junk? The grafix are horrible (fugly characters) and boring, stupid. dumb story line. If you want to see well made rpg game, play Baten Kaitos. Now, that's real RPG with class!"
1,This game sucks,This game was supossed to be awsome but it is not. You can not fly choppers or even ride a motorcycle. There are no fast cars at all. I TOUGHT THAT THIS GAME WOULD BE AWESOME! I own GTA3 and a demo version of GTA:Vice City. Dont wast you r money because this game sucks! Go and Get SOCOM: US Navy seals it is alot better.
1,Buy something else,"Don't waste your money. Compared to Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City has better graphics, new weapons and vehicles (including motorcycles) and brand-name music. But don't be fooled- the poor response of the controls in combat cancel them out, and then some. It's pretty dumb. A step backwards as far as I'm concerned. If you don't own Grand Theft Auto III, buy that instead - it's worth your money. If you do, buy something else."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR KIDS... PLEASE,"If your youngster is begging and pleading for you to purchase this game for them, I would highly discourage complying to their will. Is is not a game that is suitable for anybody who is of an age where they are so hugley influenced by what they see. Unless of course you think car-jackings are cool, murder is COOL, Killing cops is Cool, Breaking the law is Cool, massacring cities is cool, et cetera. This game rewards your child for the shear amount of destruction that they can create. If I was the manufacturer of this video game, I could not live with myself. It is of utter dissatisfaction to me that this game is so highly popular in our country. I hope that you do not choose to support something that will so awfully influence your child. Teach them how to play chess or go spend some time with them at the park. Please DO NOT let them sit in front of the television for hours on end absorbing the terrible nature of this game."
5,Awesome,The game is much better than GTA3. Being able to buy your weapons etc.. is so cool. I recommend this game to everyone. It is one bad game.
3,Great game but badly coded.,"The game slows down in rain sequences and it flakes out at times. You get shot when you shouldn't (like when you are behind walls).I wish they spent a little more time testing it before launch, but otherwise a fantastic game. But it should work flawlessly."
3,bought as a gift,"Since it was a gift, I never played it. It seemedto play just fine. They were having fun with it."
4,Review vice city111,I know every one thinks this game is bad but its not is rated 5 stars in education. all the parents think that its all about shooting but its not. most people who buy this game don't even use the weapons. Most people like to drive around and buy a house. You can buy speedboats too. You can buy other stuff like buildings. And also its not like people come up to you and shoot YOU that only happens if you push them or something. The missons are not that bad to most of them are just picking people up and droping them off at different places. And another thing some of the companys over rate games. so if you think this is bad and gorey its not. Like i said before most people like to drive around and buy stuff. Also you can do stunts of jumps with the cars and motorcycles.
5,Varooooooom!,"Bam! He's back and he'sstealing cars pickin' up hookers,shooting cops,robbing petdestrians. The game is easy,complete missions,get cash,and have some fun {wink wink}.I played it a couple million times and I can't stand to cheat.Guns ahhhhh do not get me started.I once drove tank over a cop car and then I made my car float,fly and do almost every thing.mOSTLY i GET LOST BUT THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS.WELL NOT MUCH TO SAY,PLAY IT,KEEP IT realand do not think its that easy to steal a car."
4,greatest game EVER with one major flaw,"All the positive things said before are true, but there is one major annoying flaw, that I hoped would have been corrected from GTA 3. Once again when you fail a mission you have to start from scratch, which often means driving half-way across town, and going through all the dialogue again. If not for this, this game would be the greatest. As mentioned before, the aiming is pretty weak, and there is some heavy slow down at some points.However, destroying a dance club with a chainsaw is therapeutic."
5,GTA Vice City Is fun..,"I'm only 11 but this game is awesome..graphics are great,cars are great,guns and other weapons..great!Everything is da best ever!Since gta:2 GTA 3 and vice city has made the top lists..well for me:DI reccomend everyone to get this game..even people 10 and above as long as parents check it before they play like my daddy did:)"
4,Its good,"This game is fun but it is not as polished as gta 3. I was a little dissapointed with this game after spending a few hours with it. It has some impressive new features, but for me it just didn't seem as fun as gta 3. I think the developers focused too much on making the video game version of scarface, i would have rather had a godfather knock off, maybe in the next game. Overall it's still an addictive game and is better than 95% of the games today."
5,Vice CIty is ok for all!,"Ok i bought this game yesterday and i haven't stopped playing it since! I know some adults are concerned about the amount of violence and language. As long as you know that your kid will not play this game and then jack a car, and start shooting people for no reason, then its ok. I think EVERY kid over 11 that doesn't have an illness knows that. Anyway this game rocks and it is a MUST BUY FOR PS2! TRUST ME! So stop reading this review and buy it now! I hope this helps all concerned parents."
3,good but ...,"good game. Nice graphics. I like it especially how the cops actually come after you. The game can get dull. You get missions and they don't seem to lead anywhere, just more missions. Don't get me wrong its a good game but I like more of adventure games like tex murphy.Also it is hard to controll some movement but adventually you'll figure it out.Buy it if you have the money."
1,Time to take a stand,"I'm no whiny ""all this violence is bad"" crackpot. However the people who designed this game crossed the line. A lot of us complain about the BS in the world and never do anything about it. Well you can do little things, like not pander to gaming companies who take a perfectly fun concept - stealin' cars and haulin' *ss and add such cheesy violence against women. I'm guessing the guys at 'Rockstar' don't get to go on many dates.Look I've got a little sister, and I don't want the boys at her school growing up playing games like this. The only way Rockstar will take the woman bashing out of their games is if we don't buy them till they do. So yeah, I want to buy this game, but I've played it, and I know what it's about.And I am voting with my dollars buy spending them elsewhere. When are you going to take a stand?"
1,Grand De-Moralizer,"This product is not recommended for teenagers or children. Regardless of what the ratings are, children under 17 do get their hands on this product and they love it! That's very disheartening because the subject content is not suitable for anyone of any age. We have to deal with crime and violence everywhere. Why do we have to bring it into our children's games? Don't we have enough moral issues to deal with as a society? Where does it stop?"
3,Great Game,After i got this game i couldn't stpo playing it for weeks. I beat it in a week but there is so much extra things to do ill be playing until i get tired of it which wont be for a very long time!
2,Not as good as the last one in one regard.,The thing I liked best about the last game (GTA 2) was the driving aspect of the game. It was very realistic and fun. Not so with this game. It feels like an arcade game when you are driving any vehicle. Also the crashing sound of cars hitting things sounds fake and tinny. The last game had much better sound effects in this regard.
3,"A very ""vibrant"" and ""colorful"" version of Grand Theft Auto","3.49 stars... The game has all the freedom of GTA (random killing, stealing cars, servicing prostitutes, etc...) The only problem is that it takes place in Miami, Florida, which means very flat terrain and the lack of a city grid. Vice City is two islands: a big useless beach with resort hotels (1) and (2) a sprawling ghetto with projects and junkyards. Yes, it is Miami, and does contain elements of a certain alternative ""social"" lifestyle."
3,must read,"i thought the game the greaetest game ever for a month, but when you finnally get to were its hard you are so tired of playing it that you just quit.the graphics are very cartoonish but very gory when you shoot off a head the blood just sprays up like a fountain hits the ground and dissapears, the violince is very animated not realistic. but there is so much of this violince, nudity and strong language including the F and D words it deserves an AO rating but they rated it M so people could buy it at a regular store. why put frontal and rear nudity in a video game, kids like me like the complex games like VC to.but since it is so complex and fun I'll give it a 3 star rating,and just an idea for rockstar games make a Teen versoin of Vice city you don't know how much money you would make off of that and please don't make the future GTA games as gory sexual and strong language in them you would sell alot more copies."
2,Another GTA game.....whoopie?,"This game is getting old. It is the same steal-cra-and-shoot-people scheme like the last 3. It is getting old. Its the same thing as GTA3--lousy, blocky graphics, repetitive gameplay, boring replay value. Only difference is that new weapons and vehicles. heck, even the game layout is the same as GTA3.Dont waste your money on this. It VERY fun at first but you'll likely to get bored of it quickly.If you have GTA3, thats good. But, no point on getting GTA: VC."
1,Waste of Time,"You try to become some mob boss of some city.Big deal.The whole game itself lacks fun.....all they did was overdo the graphic details,that's all.I could'nt stay focused on this lackluster game,and I finally threw it away in the garbage.I'm VERY sorry I wasted money on this piece of garbage."
3,a must own,"yet this game was so awesome its not grand theft auto 4 most likey becuse its set back in the 80's and has a fixd story line to come before gta3 so theres alot of suprizes! anyway lets get down to it the music was alright and the cops are harder then ever plus the cars are awesome and you get to acess the insides of place's and buy factorys,clubs, and more you get to do alot more then gta3 but beweare this game is missing alot of stuff but buy this game it well make a good holiday gift"
5,THE BEST GAME EVER MADE,"Hey, i just bought this game, and it is insane...i loved GTA3 but in this....it has all the things i wanted in GTA3. You can actually fly...go in buildings...ride motorcycles...The cops are smarter...they actually go after other people...Crazy amount of weapons...about 40 or so...Chainsaw...AK47...butcher knife...and so on..BUY THIS gAME it IS AWESOME"
2,I know I'm just a kid but...,"I don't think this game deserves anything.First of all, it is completely off the topic of all of the other Grand Theft Auto games. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The characters are dull and didn't have much thought put into them, and the same thing with the missions. They are either too hard or too easy. Most of them, however, are dull and boring as ever.Second, people say that the objective of the game is to beat it without using cheats, but I believe it is to get a ton of property. The game focuses way too much on what house you own. Personally, I could care less about what I own. it just deducts from the money I make.Finally, it is obvious that the focus of this game was not on the quality, but how much you can do. They put all of their effort into making the radio stations and designing clothes, rather than making the game fun. I really did not enjoy playign this game."
2,Disappointing!,"Being a major fan of GTA3, I can't tell you how disappointed I was with the look and play of the game.1. The shooting system was simplified so each shot hit somebody.2. I got through a rampage on a first attempt w/o having any idea what I was doing. Anybody who played GTA3 knows how difficult these could be.3. The fonts look like ...4. The map is distorted and difficult to read5. The blank screen you see after you go to the hide-out is annoying.I was expecting Godfather II and got Godfather III instead...Gotta hand it to RS in cashing in like this. Sorry to say they won't be able to hype the next game after this disaster.."
1,where is my stuff?,"i'd love to rate this game.after ordering it, 13 days later i'm still anxious to even see the delivery person at my door.the suspense is beginning to subside. i can only hope that if/when this game does arrive, i'll still be as excited to play it.so,in conclusion, if i ever actually get to play this game,i'll be glad to rate it for you."
5,take me down to the paradise city...,"WHOA. My jaw is dropped in awe...I applaud Rockstar Games for creating a superior to the game I once thought to be the most genius creation in the world. I didn't know just how wrong I was. This game blows GTA3 out of the water. Twice the weapons. Three times the vehicles. Vice City, Miami. You can go in buildings, thwart the cops in new ways, complete new missions, hear 9+ hours of radio, buy property, and do what it takes to make Vice City yours. I got this the day it came out and haven't regretted it for a second since. All PS2 owners NEED this game. All non-PS2 owners need to get a PS2 and buy this game."
3,A BIG let down!!!!!!,"All I have to say is that I have been waiting for this release for a while and I am now really disappointed with it. Above all else, I think when compared to GTA 3 it fell short. Maybe I haven't played it long enough, but I don't think I should have to. When I played GTA3 for the first time I was totally blown away by it. I think that the graphics and gameplay in Vice City are lower quality than GTA3. The ideas are cool(motorcyles,helicoptors,airplanes, knives,hammers,ect.) but I think the gameplay and graphics need some work. It ended up turning out like a hybrid of GTA3 and State of Emergency (the worst game on PS2, if not of all time). GTA: Vice City took out the realistic movement and gore from GTA3 and replaced it with cartoonish movement and gore. It isn't a HORRIBLE game but I think it takes some getting used to (unlike GTA3). Buyer beware!! Rent it first to make sure you like it and DON'T trade in that old GTA3!!! I made that mistake."
2,I Don't Understand All The Hype,"I don't get the hype. I admit I am not a huge fan of the ""gangster"" genre but there are several things that are really just average about this game. First the graphics quality is quite below average. The gameplay to me (my opinion only) is quite boring. Yes you can go around a punch people and run them over with a car but after a while, its actually quite boring. Anyways I am sure many people will like this game but there are clearly much better games out there."
4,Revolutionary!,There are a handful of games I could play forever and Grand Theft Auto VC is one of them. I love the 80's theme and the music is out of this world. Tommy Vercetti is also a very likeable character and I love the little things he says throughout the game. The gameplay is smooth and easy to handle and the missions are enjoyable. This is the best game in the series in my opinion.
4,Not Bad!,"Though I am a big fan of GTA, I only bought Vice City to go with GTA3. The first few months of playing it was pretty cool. After a while, I got sick of being in the 80's. For some reason I don't mind Liberty City or San Andreas. But Vice City really mames me feel depressed. But it's still a good game above par."
4,THIS ROCKS,"Being a big fan of GTA, I have read up on the official story of what this game will be like, and let me tell you that it rocks!! Everything will be bigger and better and you can expect many new vehicles, weapons, locations, indoor play, and all against the incrible background of 80's Miami. This is a must!!"
3,"GOOD GAME, BAD COLOR (5-STAR FUN, 3-STAR COLOR)","OFFICAL RATING BY ME: 5-STAR FUN, 3-STAR COLOR, 4-STAR-OVERALLthis game is awsome, im sure you alredy know that. but what you dont know is that the color is horrible. its too dark, its hard to see whats going on at ""night"" even during the ""day"" the colors are really dark and sometimes hard to see. An example is that its hard to see a person at a distance when they are against a background of any color. often you wont see them. or its hard to tell which person you are in a crowd of people your fighting because all the colors are the same washed out dark mud. i think they were going for realism with the shadows and they went way overboard. if they had stuck with the color scheme from gta 3, then this game would be off the charts with coolness"
5,oh...my...god...,"What can I say? It definitely lives up to the hype! If you liked Grand Theft Auto 3...well then you probably already have this, but if not, go out and get it now! As you know, in this game, the main character DOES have a personality/name (Tommy Vercetti), and sometimes when you jack a car ..., he'll say something (""you should've stayed at home today!"") The whole 80s concept is just sweet, the coolest thing ever is flying down the streets of Starfish Island on a Freeway (Harley-Davidson Motorcycle) listening to Anthrax on VRock. Oh yeah and the missions are cool too. The ""Death Row"" one is keeping my busy..."
5,A Lot of Great Fun!!!,"I love this CD because the music is so dynamic and rich and is an excellent compliment to Marilyn's voice. A couple of tracks could have been done more imaginatively, but most of them are a lot of fun. I hope that this inspires other DJs to take a crack at remixing her songs as I think this CD shows that there is potential for some really incredible stuff to be done. Her voice doesn't sound dated at all and she could have been recorded yesterday."
1,Caused My Ipod to Hang,"Used for a while with mixed results, and then my ipod started hanging, only when using this product! Only solution was to reset. Once it wiped the contents and had to resync with itunes. (right before throwing the product in the trash!)"
2,Average Car kit,The reason it doesn't get a better rating from me is because my video ipod keeps sliding down and/or coming off from the craddle. This is due to the fact that the sides don't lock and there's not enough resting place for the ipod at the lower part of the craddle.
1,Terrible Design,"This kit is absolutly terrible, there is so much feedback from the power system that feeds into the FM modulator you can hardly make out the song playing. That is if you can even get the Ipod to stay in the holder long enough to pull out of the driveway. My advice would be don't waste your money on this, splurge for a better unit that has more channels, or hard wire a base station into your car."
3,great product for the price,"I read the reviews after I bought this product and figured I would be sending it back but after trying it out in my Tacoma it fit nicely and plays very well. ""Made in China"" is my problem because now I have to think about some sweat shop that expliots workers making this stuff for spoiled American's. If you can live with that, go ahead buy it."
4,great deal,"for the amount i paid for this item it was great. its a little unsturdy, but has a sends a great conection to the radio"
1,Questo e il Bacio di Tosca!,"Angela Gheorghiu is the worst lyric soprano ever. I've never heard anybody sing ""questo e il bacio di Tosca"" like that, it's too loud, even louder than Leontyne Price's RCA recording. I don't like it! Gheorghiu is not acting like herself here. She tends to act like Teresa Stratas at times for no good reason. No soprano should ever sing the ""Questo e il bacio di Tosca"" to Scarpia like that and Zinka Milanov will tell you so. Maria Callas will also. That's the limit of how those sopranos should sing it, not scream it! Stupid Gheorghiu, she is too dramatic. Period!"
4,"""Fun and Fluffy""","I first watched ""Sunburn"" late one night on television back in the eighties. There isn't really much to say about the movie (which explains its absence on DVD and Blu Ray), but the movie is light-hearted and fun with beautiful scenery as it was shot on-location in Alcapulco.The story deals with a detective, played by Charles Grodin, who goes to this beautiful island paradise to investigate a murder. The cast is filled with many talented actors, among them Farrah Fawcett, Art Carney and Joan Collins in a supporting role who steals the movie as a sex-crazed nympho named Nera.The film was a co-production between the U.S. and Britain and pretty much bombed at the American box office."
5,"Was and is, still, the handiest and cleverest bike tool around.","I have used this thing since I can think and I always have one with me. It is handy, and for the quick fix on the road it is perfect. I love it."
5,refreshingly honest,This book reads quickly and is quite absorbing. It is amazing that the author could be so honest especially when it is written so close to the death of her parents. There are parts of this book that you will remember for a long time.
5,Breathtaking and emotional,"I felt very emotional after viewing this video. It's hardly worth banning, and I think that everyone should view it. It shows poignantly what happens with a depressed, angry young person. I idolize Madonna for her ability to express what she wants without limitations, and for touching on the most sensitive subjects that most people shy away from. I think this video is very important to society and people who are open minded will be just as deeply touched as I was."
1,1 Star for the Cover,That's all it's worth - 1 Star for the incredible album cover by the phenomenal Sir Ken Kelly. I just can't bear to take away enough stars for this complete waste of aural dung
3,Not as described....,"First of all, there is no 'locking blade protector' included. Secondly, do not mistake this for the highly rated (Cook's Illustrated) 10"" slicer with the Granton (dimpled) blade. This stamped knife is produced in Switzerland and appears of decent quality. However, shoppers should do their homework. Unlike most items carried by Amazon (even taking into account 'free shipping'), Amazon is not very price competitive."
4,Good cookware,"I bought this dutch oven with high hopes that it would be just like my Le Creuset dutch oven for MUCH less, but that was not the case. Perhaps I am just picky, but I did notice differences in the construction as well as in the enamel itself. The enamel was not as smooth and therefore not as easy to clean as Le Creuset. It did cook evenly and at a lower temperature. I have several traditional (non-enameled) pieces of Lodge Cast Iron pans that have been with me for years, and honestly, I like them better than this pot. I give it 4 stars since I am a life long fan of Lodge products. I also think that enameled cast iron is a great thing. Maybe this will grow on me with time."
4,"A bit of a hassle, but my little one LOVES it","Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem putting the 'bar' on (it just slides right into the fabric tubes). Getting it to *stay* in was another story - my little one loves to kick at it (and I mean *loves,* those little feet just start going the moment we get in the car!) and would often kick the 'bar' loose. A couple of quick hand stiches solved that, and now baby is amused for the entire car ride. It was also easy for us to attach in the car, as we have a center seat headrest (it simply has a velcro loop to go around the headrest bars) - without that though, it might be difficult to use. A definite winner for our little one!"
4,"Blues from the Gutter, by Champion Jack Dupree","This is an excellent record, probably the best from Champion Jack Dupree. I would hesitate to call it a pure blues record, since many of the tracks do not qualify as blues (e.g. Frankie & Johnny, Stack O Lee) but the mixture is well chosen. His version of ""TB Blues"" is the best I have heard since Big Joe Williams. If you break down the tracks into components, they may not appear sensational: the musicians are OK, but not sensational, Dupree's voice is OK, but not sensational, etc. but here everything works out and the shortcomings are barely noticeable. They probably recorded what they had at the time, which was not much (only 10 tracks) and the record is on the short side for modern CD's. Nontheless: it can be stronly recommended."
2,Didn't do the job,"I had a mechanic put the helper springs on my car before I left for Florida from Michigan loaded with luggage and a mobility scooter. The back of my car was still scraping on the ground when I went up a small grade. A few months later I had the car back in the shop and my mechanic discovered one of the helper springs was gone (it had fallen off at some point) and the other one was compressed so much it wasn't ""helping"" at all. I upgraded to 2000 lb capacity springs."
5,My son loves this movie.,"Just like the TV show, this Superwhy DVD is a quality movie and just what my son wanted. Thank you very much!"
1,Didn't work,Very disappointed that it didn't work. I put the batteries in and nothing happened when I opened the doors. Plus one of the doors would stick and not even open when I would push on them. Since I've read other reviews about this bank not working I don't think I'll order another.
1,Really. It's that bad.,"At first I thought Mr. Futter's review was surely a bit exaggerated -- but then I opened the book. It's every bit as bad as he says, and maybe even a bit worse. I realize this information isn't very helpful, since the only people who are going to read this book anyway are students who have been assigned it in a class and therefore have no choice but to read it -- but, if you have any say in the matter, I second Mr. Futter's advice: Flee from this book as you would a horde of bees."
5,great book,I DO'NT READ REGULAR BOOKS THAT OFTEN MOST ARE SCHOOL BOOKS. I PICKED UP A COPY OF THE BOOK ON FRIDAY.HAD FIRST CHANCE TO START ON MONDAY MORNING TO LOOK AT THE BOOK. I STARTED READING THE BOOK AND COULD'NT PUT IT DOWN. WITHIN A FEW HOURS BETWEEN READING THE BOOK AND OTHER DISTRACTIONS I HAD MADE IT TO PAGE SIXTY.IT IS HARD FOR ME TO STAY FOCUSED ON READING BOOKS DO TO OTHER THINGS GOING ON AROUND ME. THIS BOOK IS HARD TO PUT DOWN AFTER YOU START READING THE BOOK. WORKING IN THE SAME CAREER AS THE WRITER I CAN FEEL THE SAME THINGS THAT HE WENT THROUGH OVER HIS YEARS IN THE BUSINESS.I WOULD GIVE THE BOOK NINE STARS IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE. GET THE BOOK AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. JP
4,Fun Fun Fun,"My oldest son has been begging me for a camera for a while now, so I bought a Kid Tough Digital Camera for each of my boys (2 1/2 & 4 1/2) for Christmas and they absolutely love them. They are constantly picking them up and taking pictures with them. They took them to Grandma and Grandpa's house Christmas night and got to take their own pictures of everyone opening gifts. They were thrilled.The only thing I don't like about the camera is the digital screen is so small and distorted. It's very hard to see what you're taking a picture of and it's difficult to review the pictures. Also, the picture quality is not that great after you download them to the computer.Overall, however, it's fun for the kids and that's all that matters to me. I didn't purchase the cameras expecting to have perfect photo's. I purchased them because I knew the boys would have fun with them."
4,My grandson loves FP Kid-Tough Camera,"I would have given, 5 stars just based on my grandson's love for his first camera, but I think with a little more effort the quality of the photos could be better. Just an auto-focus would have resulted in better photos and more lasting memories. I love seeing the world from the perspective of a 5 year old. Thanks go out out to Fisher Price, just make it a more camera and a little less a toy."
2,For fun only,"My mom bought this for my son and he was so excited when he opened it. The excitement quickly waned (for me anyway) after taking a few pictures. I took a few pictures myself to determine if the poor picture quality was from the camera or from being taken by a 3 year old. When I loaded the pictures onto my computer they were out of focus around the edges and very grainy. This would be a great product if it had higher pixels, hence the overall rating. This is a good item if you don't plan on printing the pictures and just want your child to have a kid-friendly camera of their own."
3,kid tough,We bought this for our 4 year old last year. He loved to play with it. The only negative thing is the quality of the pictures. Even with proper lighting the pictures were blurry and dark.
1,Returned all three,"I bought this camera as a gift for Christmas this year, when the camera came I opened it to put batteries in it so it could be used out of the box. I found that the battery connection had been put togother backwords, so the camera was unuseable. I returned it and purchased a new one, again I had the same problem. Again I bought another one and had the same problem.I have given up on buying this camera. Fisher Price help line addmited that most all of the cameras made for the holiday season would have this problem and have to be returned, Good luck to anyone who bought this as a gift."
3,Classic eighties rock,"A good compilation of rock tracks from the glam rock era of the eighties by quite a popular band of the time. Though I can only give this 3 stars as I don't regard the guitar playing as original as some reviewers have given credit for. In my view this guitar player was just a clone of Eddie Van Halen, though he wasn't the only one around at the time."
1,SELF-IGNORANCE,"This book is an autobiography and, as such, is supposed to be an exploration of self. It is not. There is no self-knowledge in this book. If Paul Monette came to any conclusions about his life they are not on display here. Here there is self-congratulation and self-loathing side by side and, achingly, these qualities never meet. He hates being homosexual, hates his body, hates his lack of talent--emotions churn unendingly--but never, Never, NEVER does he realize that these hates are aspects of one whole. Bitter invectives against the government, the straight world, people in general are presented with a self-complacency that astounded me from someone who never ceases to beat his own breast about other things and cry ""mea culpa."" It's like the man is two people, and these two haven't had a conversation in years. This book is a disaster from any point of view"
5,"Moving, courageous, honest","Like a previous reader, I read an older version of Monette's 'Borrowed Time' and hoped I might one day meet this wonderful man; it wasn't until I saw nfalzone's review here before reading 'Becoming a Man' that I realised Monette has since died. I also cried; Paul Monette really touched something in me and I can only hope that many, many more people will read this book, though I fear he is somewhat preaching to the converted. For those of us with gay family members it is a real eye opener, though I don't know that many parents would be able to handle this book. His story will drag you through so many emotions, not least anger; may Paul Monette rest in peace and may he be an example to us all to speak out, with open hearts and minds."
3,A worthwhile visit,"""Derevnia's Daughters"" is a non-fiction account of a pioneer family living near Kodiak, Alaska from 1889-1964. The story was taken mostly from letters, diaries and interviews of the family involved. It tends to drag a bit toward the end, but the early descriptions of life on a remote Alaskan island are very enjoyable. I live in Kodiak, and it was fun to read the story and pick up bits of history and ancient gossip. Even if I didn't live here, though, I'd recommend it."
1,wrong description!,THIS ITEM WAS ADVERTISED TO WORK WITH SEGA DREAMCAST WHICH IS COMPLETELY WRONG. THE ACTUAL PACKAGE DOES NOT MENTION THE DREAMCAST ANYWHERE. THIS WAS THE SOLE REASON I PURCHASED THIS ITEM. COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED FROM THE FALSE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.
2,Don't recommend,"smells like cocoa, does not plump or last. Good color. that's the only good thing about it. I am really disappointed"
3,works ok,"I know it says this is a lip plumper, but I have to say I'm not a believer. It does smell like coconut and glides on smooth, but for the lip plumping action, haven't noticed a difference. But if your looking for a yummy lipgloss, this is a good choice!"
1,"Entertaining, but not very useful","If you are looking for a book to help you out with physio, I recommend buying ""The Physiology Coloring Book"" (Kapit/Macey/Meisami). Lazaroff's book has several mistakes, and unlike the Coloring Book, it lacks the important details."
3,Anatomy --- of a book,"The book is good for its purpose, however I think that more pictures need to be added. I am in an area of study where I know what a good chunk of the stuff in the book is, however seeing it is much more helpful."
2,Where is the rest of it???,"Great CD, but the Amazon mp3 download version is missing three songs. What gives? I am very disappointed. Amazon should have noted that the songs would not be in the download."
5,Invaluable,"Quotebooks are invaluable for writers--good quotebooks. This is one of my favorites, because it is indexed by specific topics, not general ones and it has a good mix of Christian and secular authors.Many quotebooks offer a lot and then when you get them you'll find the same tired, old rehashed quotes in your other ones. Plus it is thick. Add this to your library at once!!"
3,bad shipment,"Customer service was ok when I had my problem, but mostly I became frustrated b/c no one spoke good english. The problem: I was charged for all four of my items but only received three. Apparently they didn't think it was their job to inform me that on of the items was out of stock and on back order. The plus was I got a speedy refund plus a replacement item that was more expensive at no cost.This item may be available for whoever is reading it at this time, but for me, its ""available"" when its not and I got charged anyway with no shipped item."
3,Boots Are Beautiful Just Not Made for Everyone,"I loved these boots and was crushed when I had to send them back. They aren't made for women with larger calves. I think these manufacturers figured only a size 2-6 would even want to purchase them. Oh well, back they went. I am still waiting for my refund credit too, it's been over a month since I sent them back.Signed - Double frustrated"
2,Cute but uncomfortable,"I was surprised these were made by Dr. Scholl's because they were very uncomfortable, as soon as I put them on. I had my daughter try them (we wear the same shoe size) and they hurt her feet immediately too. I returned them. The two stars I gave are because they did look nice."
2,"all my stars go for the look, none for comfort","I bought a pair because of the good reviews. Well, they look good, but they are not very comfortable as others said. It's very hard to walk in them. If you are not super-high heels lovers,don't buy them."
4,Excellent book for fundamentals of Verification Methodology,"This book is very detailed and focussing on a verification methodology, Test plan and describe about block level to System Level verification.Also it is explaining the verification language 'e' -Specman in detail, saying that the book explains the details of the diff inbuilt methods,default structs , how to extend them for editing and their usage. Important matters are explained through pictorial views, like temporal expressions,events and standard methodologies for verification.The book is very useful for digesting the concepts and thorough knowledge of language.I am working with INTEL, as a verification engineer and found this book very useful for verification using Specman."
5,Awesome all-purpose knife!!,"I bought this knife after taking a cooking class in which my instructor raved about these knives... later I also saw a top review in Cook's Illustrated magazine. Honestly, I didn't know what a sharp knife was really like until I bought mine. I have a couple of the paring knives as well as this one and I can't say enough of great things about these knives!"
5,Music that lifts the spirit,"A wonderful collection of purely instrumental songs, ""Leaves of Life"" is Martin Simpson at his finest. Simpson's acoustic guitars (and talented fingertips) give life to beautiful Irish and Scottish-inspired melodies, my favorite being Jock O'Hazeldean, a song that will dance through your subconscious long after you've finished listening. This is certainly the kind of music for which the guitar was created. Most enjoyable!"
2,couldn't get into this one,"I'm sorry to say, that i didn't like this collection of poetry, i liked some of her other work's better."
5,Evangelical Ethics,I found this book very helpful for answers to many questions about modern issues for christians and what the bible has to say regarding them. Sometimes it helps to have a book like this to help those who are facing difficulty in their life and show them the verses in the bible to clear up any misunderstanding of what we are to do as christians with our lives and choices.
5,One of my favorite diapers!,"I love these diapers and Swaddlebees products! I have used these diapers for 6 months and I wash them every other day... They still look brand new! They fit my baby like a glove and he can go 3-4 hours in these diapers without a doubler and he is a heavy wetter. I can't say enough good things about Swaddlebees products. If you have a chubby baby, I suggest sizing up. My son is 19lbs at one year old and is wearing size medium with still tons of room left to grow in. I wish I had more (although I don't need more)."
2,great diaper if you don't mind leaks.,"very disappointed. just switched to cloth diapers in February, and so far, every time our dd has worn them, they've leaked out the sides. which is a shame, b/c love the style, love the snaps on the hips, love the softness, love it being an AIO."
2,Bean Feed does not work,Have to push the beans down every time to insure they get to the grinder.Water tank is small.- refill often.My previous Saeco worked for 5 years of constant on time. This one has auto shutoff which is a positive.You do have to leave the coffee bean door open all the time so you remember to hand push the beans down each time.Try to find an automatic machine that has all the critical assets working -Disappointed user.
4,Could offer more info in detail.,"Could be better, but not a bad book. Could be better, but not a bad book. Could be better, but not a bad book."
4,"Great Box Set--""BUT"" What Happened To Silver Threads and Golden Needles "" ??",Strange they would release this set and leave out the biggest hit she had with The Springfields. Silver Threads And Golden Needles is so associated with Dusty that no way should they have omitted it. They should have left out the awful Blossom Dearie track and included Threads and Needles instead.So what I did was re-burn the 1st disc for myself and left out the Dearie track and put in Silver Threads and Golden Needles instead.At least I don't have to listen to Dearie everytime I play the 1st Disc. Still there is no excuse for them omitting Threads and Needles.
2,For real zzzzz,"A rather dull set with a shortage of memorable tunes or catchy hooks. There are a few standout tracks - the title tune, ""ABC-123"" and ""The Good Old Days"" are all reminiscent of peak LeVert, but most of the rest are overlong, lacking in ideas or freshness and ""Clap your hands"" redefines the term album filler. Fans would be better served by checking out ""Men at Large"" issued at around the same time."
5,Best short stories I have ever read,"I love this book! I found myself laughing and crying through out the book. Two of my favorite stories were, ""15 Minutes of Fame"" and ""Bedroom Secrets of Pets Revealed"". I have 2 large dogs and 1 cat and can relate to both of these stories. It's nice to know that there are so many people in the world that give the gift of life and love to their animals. If you too are an animal lover, this is the book for you. I am sure you will relate to at least one of its many well written stories."
3,A Decent Addition to Your Library,"As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, there is a bit of repetition among the patterns and there are a few areas that could be spelled out more clearly but this is one of the lesser priced books I've found for chunky projects (my favorite).If you are advanced enough to be able to amend patterns, you might find you enjoy playing with these patterns. I prefer to knit in the round so I modified the patterns to fit my needs.No, this book is not perfect but it is reasonably priced and I had a good experience with it."
5,Good Product,"I have been using this for a while. Started using it for neck pain, which it helps quite a bit , then used it on my face when I was out of night cream. It really makes my skin look better, I googled it and emu oil has been studied and makes skin thicker."
3,great sound but picture misleading,"These speakers sound great for their size. The picture that amazon.com has representing the speakers is misleading though. The maple speakers shown have nice silver accents. The ones I received are in fact maple, but have black where the silver is represented in the picture."
3,"Good idea, but problems, including NO subtitles...","The complete series is a GREAT idea, but the execution isn't so hot. The packaging stinks--the DVDs are in paper sleeves enclosed in a single plastic cover. Many of the DVDs jump a little, and no subtitles or extra stuff are included. I have the first season as a separate release, and the interviews with Stephen Cannell and Stepfanie Kramer are most enjoyable. I can't help but wonder what other extra stuff I'm missing out on by getting the whole series set..."
1,Disappointed,"This is my first lower than 4 star review. I got this for my mom for Christmas and the dvd's do not play very well. They freeze very badly. We have not been able to watch one full episode and we are on disk 20. i am so disappointed because this was a gift i was so excited about getting for my mom. it was her favorite show for a long time. i have cleaned my blu ray play, tried the disks in other dvd players in the house, and its the same thing each time. if someone is going to put out the full season they should make it a higher quality disk. i would have paid more if my mom could actually watch it."
5,Original Songs update,"this is from a Project Manager atMill Creek EntertainmentGood Morning The masters of the episodes that were provided to Mill Creek Entertainment by the producers are the syndicated versions. With regards to the music issues surrounding the Hunter television series, the majority of the programs contain the original music as it was broadcast. There are some episodes where the original songs were removed by the producer for reasons unidentified to Mill Creek.Terry"
5,Unbelievable!!!,Truely changed my life. This book is a must for everyone with an anxiety problem. Thanks Daniel Rutley...you changed my life
3,Nice but make sure it fits you crib!,I bought this for our nursery because it matches our crib set--and it is very cute. The only frustrating thing I have found so far is that we had a hard time installing it because it was designed for a different type of bed then we have (we have a bassett sleigh crib). My husband essentially had to rig the thing to fit safely on our crib--
1,Absolute Garbage!!,"The only good thing about this mobile is that it matches the Lambs and Ivy Jake set. Other than that it is absolute garbage.The cheap plastic molding of the assembly scratched my $600 crib and it is still not very secure. The mobile squeeks while playing music and it plays virtually for about 2 minutes. Then you have to wind it again. This Item is really good at it's main purpose however, which is suckering you to pay $30 because you have the rest of the set. If this piece was included in the set, I would expect this kind of quality, selling it as an extra cost is ridiculous. The good reviews must be based on looks alone , avoid at all costs."
1,German Ivy = noxious weed!,"German ivy, escaped into the wild in moist areas, is a noxious weed capable of climbing and killing trees. It also smothers wide areas of vegetation on the soil surface. It can root from small fragments of stem. Please don't plant this pest!"
3,Nicely made but way too big,This is a great gig bag but it's way too much for my keyboard. I can actually zip myself into it. The size would be ok if there were some protective separators. The length is good but the depth is almost double what it needs to be.
3,"Good price, Ok quality","This bag is HUGE, almost too big. The problem with it is that the straps need to be bigger. It will kill your back carrying this with a keyboard in it because the straps cut into you. Also, the poor quality of the clips that the straps connect to is a joke. Mine broke on the first use. I would only recommend if you are carrying by hand and not very far. I am using for a Yamaha P-95 which is very light weight and it broke the shoulder strap clips."
3,Cheap case does the job,"It didn't cost much, and it covers the M-Audio 88es well. Unfortunately, I could put three M-Audio 88es keyboards in there. I did not find any cases that actually fit the skinny little 88es, so I went for the cheap one. It is well built, and well worth the price, it covers the keyboard when not in use, protects it in transit, and it carries well enough. I would have spent more if it actually fit.....I have a Nord Electro 73, and the somewhat more expensive Nord case fits absolutely perfectly. I can only wish............."
5,Music to Strangle Goats By,"Somewhere in an alternate universe, the illegitimate love-child of Charles Manson and Bobby Darin was channelled through the spirit of Elvis... and the result was the music of the Reverend Dr. Fred Lane. ""From the One That Cut You"" is unquestionably one of finest examples of life-altering dementia ever recorded. I cannot recommend it highly enough. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll flee in stark, raving, Lovecraftian terror. Buy it and beware!"
2,Lame book,"This book is lame. I got into the arcade collection hobby about a year ago and have really dove into it headfirst. I am a member of a lot of the collector message boards and go to auctions and arcade events near my home. The price guide seems a bit out of wack. I don't think you can price guide an arcade. I have seen Ms. Pac-mans go from $250 to $1650 and Kung Fu Master games go from $200 all the way to $1000. The price ranges are so large it doesn't make sense to price guide these. It all depends on how much someone loves a game... Auctions skew the prices a lot, so do people on ebay that overpay. The guide lacks a lot of games I see out there. Waste of money. Want a price range, go on ebay and craigslist and message boards."
3,"Wah, wah, wah","I have to agree with some of the other reviewers; Janis, of course, is awesome. The documentary part is interesting, but I wanted to vomit when I heard some of the interviews with the rest of the members of Big Brother. All it seemed like they were doing was complaining that Janis left and became more famous than them. Some of them I considered to be actually disrespectful seeing as Janis is no longer alive and cannot even defend herself. One member even said that he thought they would have been better off with Janis never having joined the group... WHAT????!!!!"
3,Practical Use.,"This book is fine for a general look at some problems but I prefer more details and diagrams for a specific model.i.e an exploded view of parts location, parts number list ect.Thank you,Neil."
5,exellent!!,"El producto llego rapido, la calidad del producto llego en perfectas condicionse. Estoy muy contenta del servicio y definitivamente volveria a usar el servicio...Gracias!!!"
3,Not inspired by build quality,"I received this item as a gift and was skeptical. The construction seemed to be solid, but a quick inspection revealed chipped enamel under the handles. I didn't even get to use mine and had to send it back. Personally, I automatically avoid products that are celebrity endorsed because they merely slap their name on whatever product offers them the most cash. This ""made in china"" dutch oven was bought on sale for $60 at Amazon and I don't think I will be trying another sample.The design is appealing, though the handles seem unsuited to carry the weight of the pot. Just my impression."
5,Great vaule for $27,"Not made w/ best material but for $27, this is a great buy. It fits me well and warm. I would love to buy another pair if there's more in my size."
1,Not Worth It,"This product has two different types of parabans in it. Methlyparaban and polyparaban. For those of you who don't care about parabans - great! For those of you who look for 'paraban' free on lotions - not so great. Also it doesn't work....at least for me in regards for mosquitoes which is why I wanted to try it, I was looking for a healthy alternative to Off. Oklahoma City, in town, out in my garden and I was getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. No standing water anywhere and near drought conditions...how? Only in Oklahoma...sheesh. Anyway I had to once again pull out the Deep Woods Off that gives me a headache and spray myself all over with it. Better toxins than some nasty virus transmitted by a mosquito. Oh well the hunt goes on for a healthy alternative."
2,Good for TV; not so much for music..........,"For movies and TV, this unit is fine. For listening to music, I shut it off as it overpowers my Wharfdale Evo-8s and does not give a very refined sound. I noticed this markedly when I was listening to a soprano soloist in a Bach cantata; the subtlety, crystalline quality was lost when the center channel was activated."
2,dont waste your money,this book made absolutely no sense. the hero was a wuss and the heroine was a nympho. i got a sample and it started out well. then it went terribly wrong. this book was an absolute waste of time and i feel cheated. i dont know how it was given four stars. yuck
4,Interesting and Lovely Music,"This 'semi-opera' is one of the last works of Henry Purcell, the greatest English Baroque composer. Essentially a series of scenes with linking music, The Fairy Queen, like other semi-operas, lacks the integrity of plot and action of real opera. In performance, I suspect this work would be somewhat static, sort of a serious music variety show. The music, however, is lovely. The Fairy Queen contains some of Purcell's best vocal and instrumental work with some components that became part of the concert repertoire. Hearing all the music together is a fine experience, though the semi-opera format tends to work against the dramatic and musical cohesion which can be found in even merely good operas. The vocalists are splendid, particularly Lorraine (as she was then spelling her name) Hunt. The orchestral playing is just as good."
2,I thought this would be good because of the previous reviews but,"I thought this would be good CD due to the earlier reviews and I love the band Confunkshun, however, after listening I was not impressed. I've only played it once so maybe I have to listen again and then decide."
5,This Group was the Bomb,"I was jumpin in the car two nights ago on my way to this party on a boat. When Funkmaster Flex was doing his thing on the radio here in New York. All of a sudden im frozen at the sound of the vocals coming from the radio. Flex started off his mix with the track ""let me be"" and the vocals slowly came in after the instruments from the lead singer kenny. I was like oh freakin snap. I couldnt believe it , I hadnt heard this song since 1993. This was undeniably one of my favorite jams that I had let slip out of my private collection. I absolutely loved that song. People walkin by couldnt stop staring into the car at me because i couldnt stop singing. this was my jam. It brought back alot of memories of a less stressful more fun time in my life. Being young and carefree. Truly a die hard hit. I am purchasing the album to keep in my private hits collection. I will definitely be playing this one at my parties and share it with my friends."
2,Skil 2100 DAF Flashing Numbers,"I purchased this product yesterday from Lowes. I was going to use it for my crown moulding project. I had been making trial cuts and it worked okay. I read about this tool and went and bought it. It worked great for about 6 angles yesterday and today I turned it on and got nothing but ""FLASHING ZEROS"". I called Skil and talked to an ""EXPERT TECHNICIAN"", who told me ""someone cleared the memory"" so I would have to return it to the store. The store has one left, which is an ""open box"" which probably has the same problem as this. Save your money and make trial cuts."
2,What did I miss?,"It came highly recommended by a local bookshop so I was really looking forward to getting started. Unexpectedly, I was very quickly put off, amongst other things, by the jarring, clever-clever literary references that seemed more to be to do with an ego-trip for the author than anything that added to the story. Confused, I gave up after just twenty pages."
4,Comfortable & Discreet (as needed),"I bought this product as a means to cover an ankle tattoo during professional situations. My first thought was to get an orthopedic ankle sleeve, but I was worried that regular compression might not be good for my ankle seeing as it is uninjured. Then I came across this gel tubing product on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. There is some compression, but it's minimal. The material is light and comfortable. It can stretch without losing elasticity and the gel lining slides onto the skin and rests smoothly on top. While obvious that I'm wearing some kind of sleeve, the nude color (on my white skin) is discreet enough for work. This isn't the original, intended use of the gel tubing and anyone looking for its anti-abrasion quality will have to ask someone else, but it's a perfect option for my circumstance. The only thing stopping me from rating this a 5-star product is that I have yet to try and wash it, though the product literature says it is washable."
3,only the good die young...,"I just finished ""Ascendance"" and I agree that it is a good read. I must say that it ""is not"" the best book in the series. Those whome have read the first trilogy, will know to what I refer.The action sequences are always captivating. It's only sad that the ""evil"" parties seem to be glorified in this book. It's a real kick in the butt fot the good guy's. How does ""De'Unnero"" get away with so many murders? Alas, ""RAS's"" true hero....I see ""Transcendance"" available now, so off we go then..."
1,DOA,"I opened this cartridge to replace an empty one and....NO INK! It didn't even appear to have ink in it. Usually when the ink nozzle is placed in hot water, ink will start to flow out, if only a little. NADA! A big disappointment."
2,Ink facet!,Anyone know a good printer that doesn't run out of ink after printing 5 8x10 photos? Lexmark cartridges 32/33 pours out like a facet and needs to be replaced real fast!
4,ok,doest last very longbut is alright i guess it does do the jobI bought a new printer an will use a different ink
5,The perfect burn,"Okay, my biggest gripe with hot sauces is that the vinegary tanginess and tomato flavor overwhelms the 'hotness' of the sauce (Tabasco and Louisiana's are great examples). El Yucatan finds a perfect balance between the two. It has a nice slow burn as opposed to, say, Crazy Mother Pucker's sharp bite. This sauce isn't for everyone, mind. It is for the discerning palate (pompous, I know). This sauce is NOT meant to be diluted. It's absolutely perfect as is on fried or baked chicken. I'm not a burn-head by any means, obviously there is and always will be sauces that are much hotter than El Yucateco Chile Habanero, but as I've stated, this is a wonderful medium between taste and 'hotness'. Til I get a better recommendation, this is my go-to hot sauce."
4,Experience the Divine,"Although I bought the album particularly for 3 of my favorite Bette Midler songs, I was also treated to a few other good ones."
2,An OK CD,"The only 2 songs that are really good on the CD are ""From a Distance"" and ""Wind Beneath My Wings"". The ""Shiver Me Timbers"" song is just plain stupid."
3,"Good, but not the best.","I was suprised at some of the songs that were and weren't on the album. I was supried, for example, at the fact that they included ""Only in Miami"", because I happen to know that it wasn't one of her greatest hits. They didn't include ""I Shall Be Released"" or ""Paradise"", which are Bette Midler standards. Also, ""The Rose"" and ""In My Life"" are different from the original soundtrack recordings. This is a good first Bette Midler CD, but if you're already a fan and have any of her CD's, you're wasting your money."
2,glenn gould wannabee 30 years too late,"Along with Zarafiants's Naxos recording, this recording ranks at the bottom of currently available Scarlatti recordings. Sure, Pletnev has the chops, and his take on K 519 is exhilarating. But overall, the performances are weirdly accentuated and too fast--K 113, in which all sense of dialogue between the bass and extreme treble in this hand-crossing masterpiece is lost, is a sad example. Scarlatti can sound great on piano, as Pogorelich and Michael Lewin make clear."
1,Yikes,"There does not appear to be one honest moment in this entire movie. Ridiculous script, ludicrous situations, cringe-inducing acting. Seyfried's snarly, pre-botox ""fact checker"" competes with ""Charlie"" for the most uninviting character in any movie this year. Redgrave disgraces herself (again) with what has become her later-year trademark loopy-grin excuse for acting. There is not one scene in this entire flick that rings true. Full-bore spreadsheet flick."
5,Excellent Movie,"I didn't hear a lot about this movie, but decided to buy it anyway. It turned out to be an excellent movie and I would recommend it to anyone. Very well done."
2,Beautiful scenery but a painfully predictable film with poor dialogue,"The one strength of this movie is the beautiful scenery of Italy. It is typical Hollywood product - the four and five star movies are few and far between.Nearly everything that happens in this movie is entirely predictable. The dialogue is painfully poor - I actually felt sympathy for the actors at several points during this movie for having to follow the script. Vanessa Redgrave deserves better parts than this.In addition to these serious flaws, I was bothered by the main character's ""issue"" with her fiance. For her to be disappointed that he didn't want to do most of their activities together on this trip was understandable. But the viewer gets the impression that she wanted him to focus ONLY on her during this trip - a very childish and egocentric view of ""true love.""The friend I saw it with brought her 9 year old daughter and I saw no reason why the movie was rated PG. The 9 year old really liked it."
2,On the boring side of romcoms,"I love romantic movies and my favorite ones have something or other to do with Italy (""Only You"", ""For Roseanna"" and ""While You Were Sleeping"" which isn't set technically set in Italy, but the main character wanted to go there). This movie did nothing for my romance-loving self. The two main love interests had no detectable chemistry with each other and were just plain bland. I thought it was really weird that this movie had some similarities to ""Mama Mia"" (Amanda Seyfried plays a Sophie in both movies and some of the characters said/did similar things to ""Mama Mia""). Can't understand the praises for Vanessa Redgrave - she moved and acted way too slow. She looked really frail. I think she was just too old for the part. Then again, Betty White is way old and she's all kinds of awesome. Vanessa Redgrave, along with the rest of the cast were just so vanilla!!"
5,Great movie,"Love the movie and really enjoyed the DVD/B-ray combo on one disk - I think that's a great way to go, since I watch on different devices and don't always have the blu-ray option .."
3,cute movie...,It was entertaining. Didn't enjoy the male leading character as much but Redgrave and Seyfried were engaging. The scenery was great. Made me want to visit Italy.
4,Pleased,"Bought this movie - first thing I've ever bought of amazon. I didn't realize I'd bought a used copy though. It came on time, when I got it, I watched it, however it said it had been previously viewed which is when I realized I'd bought a used copy. It was a little scratched with visible fingerprints, but after spraying it with eyeglass cleaner it was fine. I'm happy I shopped around and saved myself $15 used or new."
5,Richard Rodgers Piano,"John's piano arrangements of the Richard Rodgers songs are simply wonderful. I loved his tender interpretations of these beautiful songs. In my opinion he has succeeded in making these already lovely songs even more beautiful.He has infused them with new life; and I believe Richard Rodgers would be most pleased and proud. John has a remarkable talent for interpretation.... not only in regard to his arrangements of musical notation, but as well, in the ways he reaches people at their core...Regardless of the music: whether it is his interpretation of the Richard Rodgers Songbook or whether it's a work of his own, John always is able to write in a way that is smart and original. He ""nails it"" (whatever he's after); and always appeals to both one's tendernes and to one's intellect. I thank him for this beautiful CD. I shall enjoy it for a very long time. I look for more from you Sir! Sincerely, Barbara Pendleton (pendletonsings2@hotmail.com)"
4,Learning spanish,My husband and I purchased this product so we would be able to talk about our children without them being sticky noses. So fat the lessons have been very comprehensive and very full on. You need to have at least an hour of free time to set aside fir this program every day and revise when you have a spare few minutes. The talking CDs are also helpful and are great if you Wang to hear it as you sleep or hear the pronounciation. So far we are enjoying this and are having fun learning Spanish
2,Don't be fooled by the brand - Feels Cheap,"This knife is advertised as a full tang knife, but on close inspection, it is a half tang knife at best. I also discovered after placing my order that these knives are stamped, not forged. Don't be fooled by the brand you can get a better knife for less money at a cheap department store."
2,Wrong music for a wedding,"I should have read all the selections before purchasing this--Orff's ""O Fortuna""?! I'm sorry I spent money on this. Many of these selections are completely inappropriate for a wedding, unless you don't mind songs that set a dire mood. Bride's magazine's compilation and ""A Brides Guide to Wedding Music"" (3 CDs) had many more useful selections."
3,confusing Aussie terminology,"There are many terms that I never heard of and inconsistent use of units, the dread of every engineer."
3,Too many useless words,"I purchased this book based on a review I read in a popular teacher magazine put out by Scholastic. I was looking for a book I could read quickly and find information that would help me understand how my language affects my students. This book did give me that information, but I had to search for it, something I did not have the time to do. I wonder who the the targeted audience was for this book? Certainly not an overwelmed 2nd year 4th grade teacher with 26 students."
4,Fairy Tale Delish!,"If you are a fan of fairy tales - this is a great book for you. It has the damsel in distress, the knight in shining armour, and the bad old baddie. In the new tradition of fairy tales, there is a lot of character development throughout the book. You learn the characters as they learn themselves.The plot is easily recognizable, and the writing style familiar, yet there is enough difference and twist added in to keep the story interesting. Familiar and fresh, all at once.This is for a serious YA reader, a voracious reader, not a YA who only reads if she has to. I would also state that it is a girl's book.(*)>"
4,Good,"This book was very good. It brought you right into the story! The plot line was good, although it didn't truly say what happened at the end. I like Meredith Peirce's books a lot. Altogether, i think the book was good. The only thing i still need to say is that while it IS a fantasy, don't expect normal things like dragons or unicorns. This is a story about magical girl/woman, but it is not your usual fantasy.PS - if you liked her books, i would strongly recommend Tamora Peirce's books. They are my all-time favorite!"
4,Yay Christmas!,"I love Michael Buble's voice and this has some great songs on it. I am sad that it only has 6 songs, but I knew that when I purchased it. It definitely gets me in the Christmas spirit!"
5,Let It Snow,"This CD is Sinatra-like. I loved it! For people who like old-time crooners, this is the CD for you."
5,Love this CD!,"Love the singer and the season; they just go together in this CD.His breezy, easy voice is great to listen to and the holiday songsmade my Christmas traveling a joy!"
5,What a voice/What a talent,"All I can say is "" Michael could sing the ABC's and I would buy it'. This guy is such an incredible talent! I have everything the guy has recorded. You will not be sorry buying anything he has put out! He's fantastic. Only problem with the christmas Cd. It is not nearly long enough!!!!!!!"
5,Holiday Excellence!,I love Micheal Buble' and was very excited to hear this Christmas album. My only regret is that he didn't sing more songs!! His voice is so velvety smooth. I basically listened to it all season. Stopping only for some Sarah McLachlan.
3,More songs please,I love traditional Christmas songs and Michael Buble delivers! But why is it so small. We need more songs!
2,Least Favorite Christmas Album,"Short album, was really dissapointed in it because I think Michael Buble' is awesome...this CD, not so much."
2,Great Holiday Music by Michael Buble,"The music in the book is great but it's very hard for me to play. I'm used to a regular right hand and a regular left hand. The way the music is in the book is for a vocal accomponiment or something. I haven't played the piano in a while and I thought, since I love Michael Buble's music and especially wanted the music to ""My Grownup Christmas List"", which is beautiful, I shouldn't have too much trouble playing it, but it's just not what I expected. I can make something out of the right hand and some of the notes for a left hand but it's not really giving the music the right sound. Unfortunately, as I was looking forward to this music book, I thought it would be different. But, if nothing else, I DO have some form of the sheet music for my beautiful song, ""My Grownup Christmas List"" but it's somewhat of a disappointment. ""White Christmas"" doesn't sound like ""White Christmas"" the way this music is set up either."
3,Pleasant Christmas listening,Michael Buble has a smooth voice reminicent of Frank Sinatra. This CD is pleasant mood music for a Christmas gathering.
5,I should've given this 1 Star,This is a great album. Michael has an awsome voice BUT I should've given this album one star for only having 7 songs. I'm just kidding although I wish he sang/made more songs for this album he is by far a great singer.
3,Rough reading,"This is not really my kind of English mystery - I am more of the ""cozy"" type. But for what it is, it is pretty good. It's rather rough reading and I did get tired of the main character angst about her two lovers but the mystery itself was interesting. I started to put it down a couple of times but kept going back until the end just to see how it ended. Definitely not a cozy but if you like rather rough police procedurals, you will enjoy this. It's a London you will NOT want to visit."
3,infectious jitteriness,"Although it often sounds like Downie is trying to teach some arcane philosophy course put to bewildered students' music, winners like ""Pascal's Submarine"", a jumpy yarn that loves to unspool, and the closer/reprise's infectious jitteriness/incisive lyrics make it worthwhile.MM,June 7/03"
1,just awful,"I too am a huge Hip fan and I adore Coke Machine Glow (it was my favorite album for quite awhile). But Battle of the Nudes is almost impossible to listen to. Yes, the lyrics are all Gord (quirky and and interesting) but do yourself a favor and don't be ""The Completist"" and buy this CD. It is just about the worst collection of tuneless noise I've ever tried to tolerate."
5,details on which songs were used for what!,"Moby uses ""Green Sally Up"" for Flower on Play: The B-sides, he uses ""Joe Lee's Rock"" for Find My Baby on Play, he uses ""Sometimes"" for Honey on Play, he uses ""Trouble So Hard"" for Natual Blues, ""Love Rock""(not on this cd) for Bodyrock, and ""Run On For A Long Time"" for Run On.How ironic."
3,"Not in the same league as his earlier works, but had one really great song left in him","Like much of the funk that was dominant in the 70s & early 80s, Hamilton Bohannon was starting to sound dated by 1989, and this album, though hardly awful, mostly sounds like it's only running at 50%. However, the funky, laid back party groove ""The Gang's All Here"" is, by itself, enough to justify buying the album anyway."
4,Read Top Secret and you will be a plant.,"Top Secret is about a boy named Allen Brewster who has to do a science project for Miss Green. Allen wants to do his project on discovering human photosynthesis. He discovers it, but noone believes him. Allen writes to the President for help and then things get Top Secret. I recommend this book because it is funny and crazy .It has plant."
4,top secert,"my book ,top secert is a great book. some things i liked about top secert are ,for one it is very exciting and really funny too.a boy named allen is doing a project on human and plant photosynthesis,but his teacher mrs.green asigned him a project about lipstick. but becuase of his project about human and plant photosynthesis he has turned into a plant.but your going to figure out what happens at the end."
5,"A great ""science"" fiction book.",My 8 year old son does not read a lot but he read this book in 3 days and then started reading it again. He learned alot about plants and the scientfic theory while reading this book. He just loved it. We had some great discussions!
3,Burried Treasure,"I had some trouble with over-dramatization in this book (the plot is good enough that Dale doesn't need to remind us), but the author's cruel fate and strong character slowly warmed me to her. The appeal of this book is the story of a woman whose love pushes her to work desperately hard for lovers and even friends who deceive or reject her in the end; the reader only needs to get past the narrator's defenses to connect with the seemingly universal theme. At the end of the book, one is left with the realization that Wendy Dale, like so many of us, is simply too intelligent, conscientious, and talented to find happiness with the average idiot, at home or abroad."
2,hmm....,"overall i would have to say that this book has A FEW parts worth reading, but a more appropriate title would be ""making stupid decisions in foreign countries"". and the stories she told are too much to be true... i find it highly unlikely that francisco was just completely innocent... and she always manages to get taken advantage of by various people in her life. i do pity her for being born in such a crazy family, and the only reason i would encourage you to buy this book is to help wendy to A) somewhat pay off her maxed credit cards and B) have enough money for plenty of therapy."
5,Warrior!,I love this laptop. It has everything I need.2Gb RAM with T2250.Maybe the best one. (price/benefit).
2,Toshiba-Bad Customer Service,"I loved my laptop for the 1st month. Then the Mother Board went. I took it into the the authorized repair shop. The part is backordered, and it's almost a MONTH now! I've been trying for several weeks to talk to Toshiba's customer relations people. I only get the gatekeepers. I'm very frustrated.I will update this, when it gets resolved.Update, Neber did hear back frpom Toshiba customer service! Amazon helped out and now they have a customer for life and Toshiba had lost one. BTW, HP customer support has been great."
3,I could have lived without it,"It's basically giving you the root-fifth for lots of similar I-IV-V progressions. Nothing you cannot figure out by ear. I think the book would be better off with plain chord charts, as root-fifth adds no information."
3,power of friendship,"Goldsmith does it again with same combination of tragedy and humor that she brought into her book, First Wives. She shows us the power that friendships among women can have. We would only hope that the law- makers are listening.I commend Goldsmith for discouraging women from wearing the ""victim"" badge forever if ever. She suggests, although sometimes outrageous, very positive alternatives. Extremely deep character development. An important message that with every ending there can be a better beginning."
3,Disappointing,"As a big fan of Olivia Goldsmith's books, I was very disappointed in this one. The story is essentially a copy of First Wives with different characters. The writing is good and the characters are original, but the plot line is just too similar to First Wives. I was also disappointed that Goldsmith referred to First Wives in Young Wives."
3,I have heard it before,"Young Wives had funny moments and had a realistic plot but I found sounding to much like, The First Wives Club. I did like that it showed woman gaining strength and independent from their lying, cheating and even no-working husbands. Then banding together to seek revenge and to be sucessful in the end. Unfortunely, I had already read that in the book The First Wives Club. How about something new, Olivia."
2,Yawn,"This live collection suggests that during the 80s and 90s Genesis's longer tunes were just as lacking in ideas as their pop singles. Putting ""Home by the Sea"", ""Domino"" and ""Fading Lights"" on here may have been a sop to older fans, but they bore the hell out of me. There's also an out-of-place drum duet and a 20 minute medley of older songs which sounds like a bad cut'n'paste job. This is marginally better than the other volume of The Way We Walk, but is that really saying anything?"
5,Yet another fine specimen... :B,"I was pleased wioth this purchase. In condition just as it said. I like the others I own in this series as well, so I'll always give these high ratings unless the seller broke the case or something. Not so in this shipment, so 5 stars to both seller & product. :B"
5,Hold your breath!!!,"This book has it all. Tension, suspense, excitement. Great millenium fiction. Read this book. You'll be anxiously awaiting the sequel."
3,"Simply splendid, refreshing, vibrant, electric, & supersonic","Only 2 words can describe this book - A triumph of nouns with a graceful multitude of adjectives, verbs, and the occasional splattering of gerunds."
3,looks good,looks good but dont have springs like other seats this size instead has lil rubber pucks not as comfortable as youd think I'll prolly not buy another one
1,"wrong part, ordered for '67 Lemans and received something esle. Charged a fee for return",Order was wrong and I was not fully refunded. Entered vehicle discription and received (8) 1 ft. spark plugs wires cords. Does not work for 1967 Pontiac Lemans. Very disappointed with refund
5,Now THIS is a textbook!,"On the cover of the book is a review that states ""Michael Dean gets it."" Well, he certainly ""gets"" how to write a textbook. Textbook writers take note: This is a straight-forward, down-to-earth look at the world of writing from a, seemingly, pretty down-to-earth guy. His honest and personable approach draws the student / reader in.Read the book from front to back or, like me, jump around based on your immediate interests. The chapter structure and lengths facilitate that nicely. It's all good.I am 41 and just beginning with the idea of actually doing something with what I love (writing). This is the first book I've picked up on the subject, and what a find it is! Real. Practical. Educational. Inspiring. Enjoyable.Bill QuinnSan Pedro, CA"
3,speakers,"there are better and cheaper speakers ( such as Dual ). these speakers are sealed so they are waterproof but the quality could be much improved as they feel cheap. they sound just okay but be aware that they don't handle bass very well ( had to use bass control on receiver turned way down to stop distortion ). my recommendation? stay away, look else where."
1,SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE,"I ordered 4 of these speakers and when we hooked them up we were so dissappointed with the sound, very hollow and pitchy sounding. I would never buy Pyle again and don't want to even mess with returning them and getting hit with a restock fee. A sony speaker that I bought at a goodwill for 2.00 was much better. AVOID these speakers!!"
1,Had high hopes for this,"I hated it. 150 pages into, he is still setting up the characters, with no action. I usually only give a book 70-80 pages to grab me, but because of Mr Campbell's reputation pressed on. By the 150th page of mundane book store politics and everyday life stuff I didn't care anymore (shrug). Perhaps the last half of the book is excellent. I'll never know."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"Mr. Campbell's short horror stories are among the best ever written. His novels tend to be horrible, however, and this is the worst example yet.This seems to be an attempt to combine The Shining with Are You Being Served? and it fails on every level possible. It wallows in its pointlessness and thinks it is being clever by not offering any clear explanations for what is going on.""Work is Hell"" may be a classic punchline but it does not make for pleasant or compelling reading.Do yourself a favor and avoid this."
1,How do I get my money back?,"Never before have I requested the return of any money that was used to purchase a novel. I figure you can gleem at least some small gem from any published author. I now stand corrected! I repeat, I want my money back."
3,The Haunting meets The Norliss Tapes,"As a devotee of ghost stories (not ""horror"" stories, though), I thought I would enjoy this more than I did. Having the paperback cover compare the author to Stephen King should have warned me. (I am sure King gets paid by the word.)This was an easy read, but I am not a fan of books that jump back and forth between multiple characters; I prefer straight-line stories that follow one set of characters throughout.It wasn't a total waste, and I did manage to finish it (lots of skimming though.)"
5,Helps out so much,using this on a 1000 watt kicker amp and it really helps out with the power. Has a digital read out screen in it so you know its doing its job. If your Amp is 1000 watt or less then this is perfect. And if you have a head/dome/gauge light dimming problem this is a great fix unless its your alternator or old battery. when I upgrade my amp and subs I will be getting a bigger power acoustik brand cap.
5,A helpful little companion,"The benefits of this series is that they provide a good amount of info for the casual reader, along with great illustrations and useful texts. I got this particular book on Ramesses for my mom who is reading the bestselling historical fiction about him. The illustrations alone are worth the price of the book -- often of the same caliber as those hideously expensive coffee table books. The text is fine, albeit brief... but again these books are primarily for general readers and great in that regard. This book would also be great for younger readers who have been struck by the ""Indiana Jones"" bug. Interested readers may also wish to check out the Cleopatra book from this same series, which deals with the last gasp of Egypt as an independent power."
4,"Higonnet is smart, but she's wrong on the law","There' a lot to recommend this book: Higonnet has you exercising your critical judgment on a plethora of everyday images, new and antiquarian, even if you disagree with her analysis.However, readers should be aware that the author substantially misstates the law in several places. She cites some interpretive dicta from a district court case in California (US v. Dost) as being the actual text of the federal law. The federal law isn't nearly as vague as she suggests. Moreover she says that the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1995 criminalized depictions of breasts and buttocks of minors. Untrue. The final bill passed deleted these provisions. These are serious omissions to a sensitive discussion.Lawrence A. Stanley, Esq. NY, NY"
2,"Too much talk, not enough ""how to""","I felt that this book spent too much time talking about ""why"" someone is a Messie. If you're looking for in-depth analysis of why you might have issues with housework, this is the book for you. If you're looking for some fast ideas on how to keep the house tidy, there's better books out there (such as ""Sink Reflections"" or ""Confessions of an Organized Homemaker""). Some of the ideas in this book sound great, but honestly - if a person is finding it hard to tackle the housework, are they going to tackle making a complicated file system for reminding them to do the housework? Probably not. This book could be an addition to housekeeping books but I wouldn't recommend it as the main one."
1,Toshiba Replacement Battery,It's been over 2 months since I placed an order...no results.I will appreciate any suggestions. Sherman
3,It was an OK text book,The solution manual to the book needs to have chapter numbers identified on each page. If you have to look something up you have to find the first page of the solution chapter to know what chapter the problems you are looking at are in.
2,Disappointment,"I was told by a friend from Atlanta to try this album. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the sound and lack of creativity throughout the songs."
3,All You Need To Know,"If you've never listened to the Melvins before, look out! Unless you dwell in the type of bizzaro world most Melvins fans live in you probably won't like much of the Melvins' offerings.Houdini is no exception. Most songs on this album, and all other Melvins albums, sound like a well recorded jam session involving the neighbour kids. If you like that sort of thing then buy this an love it. If you don't then move on brother cause there ain't anything here for you.That being said, HONEYBUCKET is the BEST, HARDEST, CREATIVE, BILE DISTURBING song ever produced by any band! Ever! Get this song somehow and play it at loud as you can. And if you loved that then get REVOLVE from STONER WITCH. Most other Melvins stuff is too bizzare for the average person but these two songs will blow the veins out of you body."
2,It's all relative,"Mostly forgetable, compared to all Melvins albums that came it. This is partially due to Cobain's production on many of the tracks. Hag Me is very good. Challange yourself: find the out-of-print Your Choice Live Series cd. Maybe the best live album ever."
1,Too much $$$$,"If you think about it, even if used the ""right"" way you are going to get tons of wonderful bodily fluids on it. You are best to buy a naked one and 2 or 3 slip covers so it will atleast be sanitary. Mine did not wash very well in the washer and sometimes spot cleaning just isn't enough........."
2,boppy owner,"This item gets two stars because of its outragously high price. My husband and I own a boppy, and they are wonderful to have but theyre not worth the $60. A bare naked boppy is about $20. Which means that the slipcover on this item is a whopping $40. Slipcovers vary in price and I have eight of them. I have one luxe slipcover which is great in the cold winter months. and the other part of the year I use the regular ones which cost about 10-12. Some Wendy bellissimo products aren't outragiously priced, however this one is. We did get this as a gift but when we found out how much it was we took it back and got a bare naked boppy and several slipcovers. Dispite what some may say $40 is not just a little more its alot more. Don't get me wrong I love Wendy Bellissimo and have alot of her items this one is just a little over priced."
5,Love this boppy!,"I bought this for nursing, but my baby loves to lounge in it--and she seriously nurses longer in this boppy compared to the other ""regular"" cotton slipcover. At 3 months she loves to stop nursing and rub her cheek against the plush material--too cute! I love it!"
5,Very Satisfied APC Customer,This is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop. It's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case. It protects my laptop from surges through the AC outlet and phone jacks. I have been pleased with APC products for about six years. They provide excellent customer support. I highly recommend their products.
4,it works but is bulkier,"Bought one few months back...n i guess it is a gud investment for costly equipments...as other reviewers pointed out...it is quite bulky....the prongs always stick out,i am not able to carry it around in my laptop bag.....moreover for those of u, who travel a lot....NOTE: this things works only at 120V that means it will simply blow out when u will use it in countries which have higher voltage ratings.....APC do have other products which work at higher ratings tooUpdate:5 Years on and this thing is still working for me"
5,look great; well-built,"These are a perfect size for any chef :). And they look very nice and professional. Built well, too."
5,"Great textbook, great reference","This book was used for a one semester course in numerical analysis. The companionbook wasNumerical Linear Algebra. Together, these books make anoutstanding start to a personal numerical analysis reference shelf.The first half of the book is where pure math students may find trouble since thepresentation of linear algebra in math departments varies widely. A practical workingknowledge of basic linear algebra is necessary. A poor linear algebra background willrequire remediation before starting this book.Topics covered in this text that I have found particularly useful over the yearsinclude polynomial interpolation and quadrature. The presentation is perfect and easyto understand.Of course, no text can be everything to everyone. It helps to have an enthusiastic andknowledgeable professor leading you through the material. That said, the dedicatedstudent should have no problem navigating this text."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I bought this bottle warmer at Target (the only travel style warmer they had) and it is awful. I will boil bottles before leaving the house and place inside this bottle warmer. After about 1.5-2 hours, they are room temp again. It will not warm a cool bottle at all. I am currently shopping for another."
1,Biggest waste of money,"We bought this warmer at Target to take with us on a 8 hr car ride. I kept the bottles in a cooler on our drive and when I tried to heat them up after an hour in this warmer, the bottle was still cold. The inside of the pouch doesn't even get hot to touch, just slightly warm. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they were using powdered formula and room temperature water, even then I'm not sure it would work."
1,doesn't work.,"As everyone else says, this thing doesn't work. Takes like 45 mins to heat a 4 oz glass bottle. Useless! I now carry around a thermos brand insulated food jar that I fill with boiling water. Keeps hot all day (easy to refill at coffee shops, etc too) and heats a chilled glass bottle in about 20 seconds. Can't beat that!! It was suggested by another reviewer and it works really, really well! :D"
2,gel sock,feels comfortable to wear but hard to get dry when it is washed. feels just like wearing one of those pads you can buy at the store . not worth the money paid for it
5,"Touching, insightful, eloquent children's poetry","I found this from NPR's Sunday Edition interview with the compiler, Sandy Lyne.What motivated me to get this book was the haunting eloquence of observations of their (children grades 3-12) lives.I was not disappointed.The book is divided into the following chapters:Angels in Bloom, Poems about Childhood; My Place, Poems about Home & Family;Black & Blue, Poems about Challenges; Then You're a Leaf, Poems about Nature & Beauty;Holding Hands, Poems about Friendship & Love; The Secret Kingdom, Poems about Solitude & Spirit.The book's title is taken from a poem by an eighth grade boy titled, ""Rainshowers.""""Rainshowerslast forever, secondsat a time, andalmost like a poemwhich is longat heart.""This is a great sample of the treasures of heartsongs and lifesongsthat you find in this book.Submitted by Mark Hashizume"
3,Everything is hyperlinked,"A short, pleasing essay on the different strands that inform our lives, which we weave into our consciousness. Rosen speaks often of personal things, but stays more on the philosophical level in his overall writing. The reader comes away knowing more about his analytical tendencies than his own history.I agree with the author that the Internet is a powerful metaphor for the interconnectedness of life. The Talmud, in its turn, may indeed be the original ""hyperlinked"" document, and I smile in wonder at the thought of trying to bring the full complexity of life to a sheaf of written pages, as (I hear) the Talmud aspires to do. In these days, can we all create our own Talmuds from the Internet, interconnected references to explain our lives? But if they are all individual, then what culture remains in common? Rosen addresses these questions briefly and with grace."
1,"A lot of fluff, no meat.","I was very disappointed with this book. The concept of connecting the Talmud with the Internet is intriguing, but the entire book takes the concept no deeper than the contents of the flyleaf."
2,Void and Unformed,"A tip of the old hat to Keith Leverberg who expressed my thoughts almost exactly with his title, although I judge Rosen a little less harshly. This book is carelessly constructed, with such screamers as, at page 130, ""The Talmud that my wife and I study from together belonged to her grandfather, who immigrated to Palestine, thanks to the Balfour Declaration, in 1924, was wounded in the 1948 War of Independence and devoted the rest of his life to the study of Talmud."" Or something like that. Read it with a grain of salt, and buy it at your peril."
3,?Maybe?,"I don't own this cd or anything, but all i know is that the band I95 is pretty good, so this must be a pretty good cd... but.. don't own it so i dunno.."
3,"Very flexible, but hard to get adjusted for faraway flash.","This one can be adjusted to point just wherever ya want, from out to the side or over head, but its hard to get it to point exactly straight ahead so its very hard to use with a better-beamer. Bulky and hard to pack as most of this kind of gear is."
4,Close to Close to the edge,"Very similar to CttE, but with the addition of some silly solo 'projects' which only in Howe's case add up to something worthy of the Yes name. This would not stimuate people to buy any actual solo albums, I think..."
1,Rhino CD Version = GARBAGE,Who left the compressor on 11? Terrible remastering. The 1994 version makes mincemeat out of this piece of junk.
3,Some Highs But Other Fragile Moments,"Many people revere Fragile by Yes as the groups crowning achievement. I do admit Roundabout is a stunning piece of music. In addition, there are other notable moments such as the compelling Southside of the Sky,Wakeman's delightful Cans and Brahms the pretty acoustic number Mood For A Day, and the radio friendly Long Distane Runaround.However, there are way too many filler pieces. We Have Heaven is just plain annoying with Jon Anderson's repetitive vocals. Five Per Cent For Nothing has potential but 35 seconds does not a song make. This song surely could have been ellabroated into a three minute jam while the slightly overlong Heart Of The Sunrise should have definitely been cut down. Chris Squire's The Fish is a bit on the drab side.The good does slightly outweigh the bad. However, I definitely prefer The Yes Album to this inconsistent release."
5,Classic Progressive Rock,"This music is timeless, it sounds just as relevant today as the first time I heard it back in high school over 30 years ago. It was originally released back in 1971."
3,A small step above the yes album,"The fragile is viewed as a yes essential by most prog fans.I would say that it fits nicely with the other 70's yes recordsbut I dont necessarily see it as the best of that decade of theyears. What we have here is 5or 6 songs woven together by littleintro's, excerps, instumentals extc.Not to say that they aren't goodand add to the album but i was expecting a little more based on thereviews that I heard. All in all its maybe a step above the previousrecord so i give 3 stars."
5,Another Great DVD-A Disc,Picked this up yesterday. It is fantastic when compared to the CD version. The vocals especially are so clear that it is like having Jon and Chris in the room with you. The most impressive track is Heart Of The Sunrise. The way the instruments and vocals have been placed in the surrounds is perfect for this type of music. Stereo and CD's are truly dead in my mind. This is the format of the future. It's like listening to the original tapes but better! No hiss. Close to the Edge is their next disc being released on DVD-A. I can't wait!
4,"OK OK its a ""CLASSIC"" (so what)","This is the album that I first heard YES on and I LOVED it - I freaked out !! I even changed my name to Jon Anderson while in college - I saw the ""Fragile"" tour and met the band backstage. I have loved them ever since. ""Fragile"" however, I cant listen to anymore.......at first I thought it was because I had heard it too much the first time around..... But I still love ""Relayer"" and ""Tales"" and ""Going for the One"" and ""the YES album"" I just cant listen to ""South side of the sky"" and ""Roundabout"" and ""long Distance runaround"" and "" Moo for a day"" and ""the Fish"" anymore. If you have never heard this album and want to see what its all about -then spend your 10 bucks.....but if your replacing that old ""Fragile"" album and have some kind of nostalgia for it-buy a 12 pack instead."
2,Not the Best,"Lots of familiar songs but done in some strange arrangements by some unfamiliar artists. Ever heard of ""Ambrose and His Orchestra""? How about Helen Humes or Elisabeth Welch? I'd pass on this one."
4,For the price and features its a good purchase.,"I bought several of these for my small business. They've worked fine. In response to the previous poor review, lets put things in perspective. Averatec is not the Rolls Royce or Mercedes Benz of the computer industry. Averatec is comparable to, for example, Kia. If someone bought a Kia they're probably cashed strapped and need a car to get from point A to B. This computer is the same. It comes with all the bells and whistles that most users would ""need"" at a rock bottom price. Even if things don't work, one can get a refund in thirty days or have it repaired or replaced in the first year of warranty. So for its extremely low price its a good deal. If you need a laptop and don't want to spend a lot of money the Averatec is good enough."
4,Diffuser,"A must for any photographer. Makes the pictures beautiful, clean and crisp. I'm glad I have this now was dying without it."
3,Funny,I liked this book as it was a very funny read. I'm not a fan of hers as far as acting and modeling goes but I have enjoyed her books about mommyhood.
2,Eh,"Minorly amusing in parts, Jenny McCarthy comes across as more infuriatingly shallow than ever in a few others. Something to check out of the library maybe, not one I'd purchase."
2,Not my brand of funny,"Humor is tricky, it's got to be a good fit. I longed for more warmth and subtlety. Somehow this just missed the mark."
4,Not for a second...,"OK. The book is soooo true when it comes to the stories of babies and funny beyond tears,,,however not for a second do I believe beautiful Jenny McCarthy got fat. Her new pictures on IMDB are georgeous. I think her next book should be titled,,,,,the laughs on you!"
4,Great TV but shipping so late,"I bought this TV instead of my old Sanyo 20"". The picture and sound really good. The remote is very difficult to set for using with my DVD player because the brand of my DVD doesn't have the code in manual for setting it. I need to trial and error for long time. Everything is very perfect but shipping is very bad. After I order this TV, I got a tracking number. I check the tracking number for a few day. It should be shipped to Chicago for 2 days after Amazon ships my order by using Eagle company. But they stop shipping to my address and I can't check my tracking online. They didn't update any information. When I called Eagle, their service was really bad. They did not ship to my address until next 5 days, eventhough, this TV are in Chicago. It didn't ship so fast like the first one comment it for one day. I'm very disappoint for this shipping."
1,not 4 guage,"Only 10 gauge, and no speaker wire. Do not buy this, spend another 40 bucks and get the real deal ofc copper wire kit from rockford ip off!"
2,Poor quality for the price,"Received this today. Disappointed in the finish work. Edges are rough, as are the insides of the knife slots- several of the knives caught on bits of wood as I slid them in. The grain and color of the wood pieces is poorly matched and there is an odd grey square of wood next to one of the slots that appears to be a repair or patch. Also, the last two letters of the ""wusthof"" logo stamped on the front are so faint as to be unreadable. I'm wondering if I received a knockoff or factory second. In any case, I will return it and shop for this item locally where I can inspect before buying."
4,Net,We had a very large knife holder so I wanted a less obtrusive one and now that I'm used to it I like the size.
3,Wasted Potential,"A character as angsty as Sir Marmaduke deserved a better, deeper story than this shallow effort. I have to agree with the reviewers who point out that the author had the characters getting unduly hung up in the sexual aspects of each other, much more so than the build up to any convincing emotional relationship. They began to come across as more like a pair of randy critters than a romantic couple, by the end."
2,wanted to love it!!!!,"i read DEVIL IN A KILT and MASTR OF THE HIGHANDS and couldnt wait to find this one[had to buy second hand]. i started reading and thought ""any time now"".the story just didnt live up to SIR MARMADUKE. it was an ok read but i truly did not like the heroine. yes i know she wnt through HORRIBLE things,but until the end she did not""give""much at all. im sorry because i do love this author.in the end an ok read but not one to lose a whole nights sleep trying to get to the GOOD PART like i did"
5,Great!,"Men of Standard has to be the best Gospel groups out there. They appeal to fans with their anointed voices and perfect vocal arrangments.How about the rhythm? With songs like ""Feels Like Rain,"" ""God Take Care"" and ""Victory's Coming"" you can help but to move! The producers, such as Mr. ""PAJAM"" himself, James Moss, did a wonderful job creating the ""Men of Standard sound.""This may be their second release but with vocals like theirs, it's obvious these men know what they're doing! ""Feels Like Rain"" is one album Gospel fans must add to their collection of music. It's sure to have your finger one the ""repeat"" button!"
5,not called MEN OF STANDARD for nothing,"I had just bought this CD and went straight home to listen to it. I can hardly remember the last time that a song touched my heart like God will take care of me, in your will, victory's coming, and espicially track 6 - LORD YOU'RE EVERYTHING. I was truly blessed. the fact that ordinary human beings can capture such mind bobbling truths and convey them as beautifully as angels - there definately is a God. To all those reading this,u absolutely must get yourself this CD."
4,I really love these...but...,"These are really so super delish and perfect for carmel apples. The reason for the one star deduction is the same as the other reviewers, the shipping packaging was very aweful and they were coming out of the packaging, it was in a envelope not a box. No nutritional information. Again, I really love these, and will buy again. Get it together with the packaging, please."
4,"Nearly king of caramels, easy to chew","Awesome product. When eating them raw remember to warm it up in your coat or pants pocket, the warmer and softer they become the better they taste. I got them to give my survival students as a little treat and boost. I have had better in Africa but these are second best. Although these have some toffee constancy they taste like real caramel. Trust me, I know my caramel so well that when I urinate on a camp fire it smells like caramel. They do melt easily but I have yet to use them for apples or other recipes. If you know of any good ones let me know."
1,Terrible and disgusting,I ordered these caramels and was very much disappointed there were ants inside the bag of caramels which they ended inside the individually wrapped caramels as well.. A waste of my money and will never order this here again!!! This never happened at [...] SMH..
2,Thoroughly enjoyable,I enjoyed the series even while I am not at all fond of the Irish countryside. As the series developed It began to lack all credibility. I think it became a victim of it's overt complicated plot line. Makes the Irish look very provincial and superstitious in the 21st century; then again Southern Ireland is very Roman Catholic. Still I was sad to see it deteriorate so quickly in the middle of the second season.
4,The New Field of Geomedicine,"The Editors of 'Geology and Health' have produced a collection of papers that will be of great interest to medical specialists, biologists, and geologists. Interdisciplinary studies on natural hazzards such as arsenic in groundwater and geochemical concentrations of toxic heavy metals in soils are required to understand the origins and pathways of some diseases.This new interest in geomedicine has been stimulated by EPA regulations and by advanced laboratory intstruments that produce extremely accurate chemical data on toxic concentrations in water, soil, and air. This will be an excellent textbook to stimulate university students to explore a vast domain between public health and earth sciences."
4,Interesting in an exotic way.,"Definitely not a movie for the mainstream, or the squeamish. Has a Japanese sensibility and storyline that makes it a little difficult for us Westerners to understand.The themes and bondage are universal however, and were nicely done. Not a how to by any means, but plenty of sexy scenes and shots to make it worthwhile if you are into the bdsm scene."
1,THE BEST OF FOREIGNER LIVE,"The CD SKIPS .I have purchased used CD'S before.They never skip,this one does.Not happy with this product.John P."
4,Ok offering of them live...they do well on vinyl,"Often a band sounds better live...not so here, great band, good songs and singing and I wanted to like it more, but give me their recordings."
1,Not suitable as a gift,"bottles do not match if your planning to give as a gift , Not suitable as a gift - First picture is sifferent than when you click on item , if i would have noticed I would not have purchased"
2,I was disappointed...,"While the artwork and verse is generally lovely, I was very disappointed by the reference to ''Mother Earth'' for the letter ''M''. Father God and Mother Earth? Not for me. Surely, there had to be something better for ''M'' like ''Moon'', perhaps. I was not able to share this book with my preschooler."
3,SC-D365 MiniDV Camcorder,"I am not yet totally familiar with the operation of the Camcorder as I have only used it a couple of times. I seems to work as it should. I have had trouble with the Light. According to the manual, the light shoud come on when you push the record button and go off when you stop recording but the light stays on as long as the camera is on. Also, once you go in and change items in the menu like 16:9 Wide to OFF. The next time you turn the camera on you have to change it again. On the second day I filmed, I got a lot of static in the sound. Maybe my problems has to do with the fact that I am not totally familiar with the camcorder yet. I will give another review after I use the camcorder for a while."
4,A fascinating look at one of our modern mysteries.,"This thick volume attempts to answer the question of how a bunch of Caucasian mummies ended up in central China. Scholarly and far-reaching, it delves into linguistics, archaeology, religion, and other disciplines.It didn't actually dwell on the mummies of Tarim much. Most of it's book scholarship, not field investigation. It tries to show how various populations in China got where they did, using whatever means it can. In this regard, it succeeds. But I wish it'd talked about the actual mummies more than it did. I got occasional glimpses, but nothing more."
2,A thorough but uninspired Introduction to Yoga,"Although very informative, it was very difficult getting through this book. This book seemed more than an introductory and appeared very dry. This was not the type of book that would motivate you to become involved in yoga."
4,Useful book,"This is a useful and entertainingly written book by an author with an interesting background. According to the blurb in the book, the author was an actor, singer, and playwright before embarking on his present writing and consulting career, and wrote the successful off-Broadway play 99%ArtFree!Don't let his prior non-technical background put you off, however, as this book is chock full of good information as well as lots of useful tips and tricks, which will get you jump-started to using your Palm or Visor like a pro in no time."
3,Stretching Scientifically: A Guide to Flexibility Training (4th Revision ed),"The book had a lot of medical terminology about the human body. The way he wrote the book, he expects anyone that reads his book, to have a lot of knowledge of medical terms and muscle groups joints and etc... stuff most people won't know about... he should try to simplify it into more laymen terms so everyone can understand what he his talking about. The pictures of the step by step process are very good and the Question and Answer section is pretty good too.I suggest that people get his DVD instead the book if you want a more simplified way of learning how to stretch better, cause I had to force myself to read the book and if I have to force myself to read a book, that isn't good for anyone."
4,A must read on flexibility,This book is very informative and easy to read. It use of common sense and research will make you re-think all the years of poor advice you have received on stretching. I have basically been stretching the same way that I was taught in junior high for the last 30 years. I have made more progress toward the split in the 30 days since I began reading this book then I did in all that previous time.
5,Great book,Great book still reading it but it seems like the stuff really works and made me understand more about stretching its anatomy
2,Does not compare to the authors Reassess Book,"This book is set up to be a follow up book to the authors Reassess your Chess Book. I think that it stinks compared to his other book. I am a good player. The book itself is oversized and has started coming apart. It is poorly put together. The material takes up much more space than it should in the pages and so there is really a lot less in the book than it looks like at first. I found some typos too. Get the authors Reassess your Chess Book, but unless he does a better job skip this one."
4,GRE:Geology Test,"Although this test will soon be out of commission, as of next year, i found the text very helpful in getting me oriented to what i need to be studying and what kinds of questions are likely to be asked. Its always good to be able to review with actual questions. But it also had little information about other the test in general"
2,Poor sound quality,"I bought this machine to replace a broken AT&T product. I have found the reliability of GE and AT&T answering machines low (none has lasted more than 2 years), and I chose the Panasonic based on Amazon recommendations and the brand name.It has been a disappointment. The most serious problem is tge poor sound quality: much worse that the one it replaced, so much that I cannot decipher several messages.The ergonomics are also inferior to my previous answering machines. The most common functions (""play new messages"", ""erase"", etc) use small buttons, lined among other functions; the LED display is very dark; etc.This product is not worth the price."
4,Light reading fun,"I enjoyed Chasing Lightning but as with most lesbian novels I read I am still looking for a female ""Tales of the City"". So of course it wasn't long enough or allowed me to become intimately involved with each character over the course of 20 years of their lives! The good thing is I really wanted to get to know these characters! It was a great ""take it to the beach"" book because you could put it down and pick it back up with out having to read back to see what the last intense scene was. It was a great light fun read. Kind of like a lesbian ya ya....kind of."
5,Exactly as advertised,"A really good workout - which is kinda rare in bellydance workout DVDs. Plus, it teaches real belly dance technique. Good for people just wanting some kind of different way to get fit, but a really good introduction and foundation for the dance."
2,Not very good instruction,"I found this video to be on the amateur side-the instructor was not good at explaining the moves (at one point saying ""you know""-no I don't know!) and the video looked as if someone had made it in their basement. It is a cheap, basic video but not well-produced."
3,Great quality soaps,"I bought this sampler because I had gotten a sample size of the this brand of soap in the oatmeal. I liked that bar, however the smells of the other bars are not for me. The clove is okay and I have grown to like it but I will most likely will not use the Rose Tangerine, Lemongrass or Mint. They are not overwhelming or anything, just not my kind of smells."
4,like the film; like the soundtrack just as much,"okay. so i'm not much of a metal fan. my tastes are more mainsstream than the hardcore stuff that's on this album. but i really enjoy almost all of the songs on this album. much like the film, it's a dark and dreary affair, but songs like ""Burn"" and ""Dead Souls"" ""Time Baby III"" ""Big Empty"" and ""Ghostrider"" make this CD more than just your usual soundtrack. All in all, I'd recommend this to fans of the movie or fans of music in general, mainstream or metal."
5,great service,Fast service even during Xmas holiday. Very happy and would do business with them again.
4,As The Name Suggests,"This one-disc Yes compilation does hit the high points of their career. Though not extremely comprehensive, it does provide a good overview of their work. If you are a new fan to Yes, or you just want the hits, this is the one for you."
4,This is the best of Yes,"Several years ago I sold off a three CD compilation of this group called ""Ultimate Yes"" and later bought this single disc set called ""The Very Best of Yes."" This album contains their best material; I doubt there is much more. It would be great if they were as creative as the Stones or Pink Floyd, but they are not."
3,Mixing their 70's stuff with the stuff from the Rabin-era???,"I'd made a Very Best of Yes from their 69-80 period and wrote it onto a 80 minute CD, here is the song-list:1.Survival2.Time And A Word3.Starship Trooper4.I've Seen All Good People5.Roundabout6.Long Distance Runaround7.Close To The Edge8.Going For The One9.Wonderous Stories10.Don't Kill The Whale11.Does It Really Happen?It's all on one CD. I think it's not the best way to put Starship Trooper and Owner Of The Lonely Hearts onto 1 compilation. Those songs from the Rabin-era are excellent, but should be put on another best of from their 80's period.Close To The Edge is the song that just simply cannot be left out from a Very Best Of Yes CD, no matter how long it is.Give Love Each Day"
2,OK,"I found the title selection very odd. Fragile is my favourite album of all time, and i would much rather listen to Fragile, than this ""greatest hits"" collection. It is definately not their greatest hits. Their first 2 albums are their greatest hits, period."
4,Awesome custome!,"A very fun, great quality custome! I bought this for my 3 month baby and it looks really good on him."
4,GREAT,GREAT QUICK DELIVERY NEEDED FAST FOR MY SONS BASEBALL. IF YOU MUST USE THESE THEN PURCHASE ASAP NEVER KNOW HOW LONG THESE WILL BE AROUND FOR WITH TECHNOLOGY CHANGES
2,This was the OLD gold standard,"Up till this year, 2007, this was the set to have, but after hearing the new Mothership remasters, it's hard now to hear these old remasters. The 2007 sonically blows away these issued in 1994 (mastered in 1990).I already have this but plan to give it away once the 2008 or later remasters are issued. This set is expensive & if u don't already have it, i'd hold out a bit & buy the new remasters in 2008 once they're issued.This old set doesnt sound bad, just not as great as the new ones."
5,"If you are a Led Zepplin fan, this cd set is for you.","I bought this as a gift for Christmas and love it so much, bought the set for myself. Well worth it."
5,Comprehensive Zep,Its got it all and at a great price. A must have complete library for the Zep fan.
5,All Zeppelin Fans and Some non fans will like it,"My wife got this for me for my birthday. Yes I am in my late 30s and hard to shop for. She hit a home run with this one. I love this. Everything Zeppelin. No modifications, no goofy remixes. Just a remastering by the Master Jimmy himself. I love this box set. I have it on my iPod and it gets played anytime I am on the commuter rail headed to work. I also listen to it at work when i get swamped and have to work on a presentation or something. The noise drowns out those around me and I keep it too loud to hear the phone. A must buy if you like Zeppelin, a little expensive but you'll never need to buy another Zeppelin anything every again.[...]"
5,A box for those who love rock,SIMPLY THE BEST ROCK AND ROLL EVER!!! All serious rock fans should have at least all Led's studio albums (exactly what this box contains).
5,Amazing journey.,"One of the most brilliant and precise works of art I've ever read. If you love the history of NIagara Falls, or have a penchant for women's struggles at the turn of the century then this is the epic poem for you."
1,dumb writing,I thought the writing was sophmoric and entirely without suspense. The characters seemed to be modeled after something that someone thought people in Miami should be like.
4,Thrilling,A quick read full of gritty style. Lassiter is the anti hero stereotype personified. A very enjoyable book and story.
2,Disturbing book coming from a psychic,"I've read most or all of John Edward's previous books and found them comforting to read, if a bit predictable. His message is usually clear, and the same over and over. This one was disturbing - it's a disturbing scenario, and coming from a psychic, I was left wonder what-all he is intending to say and suggest by it."
4,INTERESTING NOVEL!,"I read this b/c John Edward wrote it. Started a little slow, but then the pace picked up steam towards the end. I was very touched at the end, but it was too short for me. ""God was the Sun"" is a much better read, same author. Just my two cents' worth!"
3,B&D Culti-LATER,"The product works as promised and is easy to handle. The tines have held up after using it for a month in clay and rocky soil, spitting up 3-4in rocks with no issues. Any larger obstacles will have to be removed prior. Small roots get cleared, but then get tangled in the tines requiring u to remove every so often. The only complaint is battery life. In regular soil it works for 30min. Add in some rocks or clay soil and the device has to work much harder; therefore, it will only truly last 15min before a recharge/battery swap. Good for working in small flower beds around 100 sq ft."
2,Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Garden Cultivator #GC818,"The only way I found this device works well is in previously cultivated or at least dug up moist soil, and, under such conditions, it worked admirably---loosening the soil to the entire dept of the tines; but not in a timely manner. Plus it didn't make a dent in packed, dry soil nor did it remove the weeds. As to its weeding capabilities after a lengthy time period it did destroy small weeds, those not more than 1 1/2"" tall. Larger weeds got tangled in the tines. I do not recommend this cultivator over the standard rotary ones because I still had to loosen the earth, wet it down if dry, then use this tool to break the soil into smaller pieces suitable for planting seeds--removing taller, sturdy weeds all the while by hand."
1,over rated product,"This product will not work on a garden 2 days after rain as it does not have the power to turn dry dirt. I suppose if you used it every day to keep the dirt soft or used a larger (motor driven) tiller before using this one, it would be o.k., although a huge waist of time. I would have given this a minus rating, however, none was available. Don't waste you money on this."
1,Sadly disappointed...,"This is a good soil ""mixer"" but it does noting for clipping off the weeds below the soil line. It needs ""L"" shaped tines to be a better tool that does the job."
1,Walter Scott (What a sad life),"Well the author of Ivanhoe was Walter Scott, he was born Edinburgh in 1771. He was educated at the high school and university of Scottish Bar in 1792. From 1799 until his death he was a sheriff of Selkirkshire, and from 1806 to 1830 he held a well paid office as a principal clerk to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, the supreme Scottish civil court. His dad was a Calvinist lawyer. He was rejected by many women he loved, so those ruin his life in early fifties. His first literary efforts were in the late 1790. He wrote about romantics, historical German poems, and plays. His first original work was a poem named The Lay of the Last Minstrel in 1805. His books were from the Renaissance Era in middle ages."
1,Stofen-Fen Bounce,"From day of order to day of delivery was great. However, Sto-Fen Two way bounce diffuser not what it appears to be. I purchased based on picture provided but instead received 2 pieces of plastic and piece to paste to flash unit for installation of bounce. Tried using the item and results varied from shot to shot. Would suggest Sto-Fen deliver what it offers and not what was delivered.Item looked good and would have been just right as the diffuser could have been moved for direct flash strobe lighting, but from what was delivered,it would not be recommended for purchase."
2,Not up to expectation,"I returned the item. It wasn't what I had expected. This is the industrial model. The head doesn't tilt backward, its heavy & a lot taller than a standard house mixer. I didn't like the fact that the bowl raised to meet the beater. I found it very hard to remove the bowl as well as the beater itself. The bowl capacity is no larger than that of the Artisan (which I replaced this item with)."
1,Don't gift this,Beware that if you give this as a gift it may garner resentment. Which may or may not be your intent:)
2,Delta Sand worth the hunt,"I have found ""Delta Sand"" a much better alternative. Can be purchased in kits from small to classroom size and just tubs alone. Stuff is incredible to play with and will keep them going for years. (used for play sand and heated for sculpture work).Can be found in many creative learning catalogs well worth it."
1,"Messy, messy, messy","I do not usually fault a toy for messiness. As an example, I love playdoh. However, this toy creates a huge mess. Do not expect this product to become the indoor replacement for your outdoor sandbox. The sand molds break apart easily as children play with them, scattering the sand everywhere. My living room was a mess! My daughter prefers playdoh because you can actually play with the things you've molded."
2,Messy,"This is a neat idea and the kids loved playing with it, but it is very MESSY. It doesn't stay in the inflatable container well with 3 boys playing. Also as others have mentioned you don't get nearly enough sand in the original set to make the castle. We couldn't keep the sand separated into colors (with a 7, 6, and 3 yo) so now we have a lot of mixed colors. It doesn't stay nice and separated as they lead you to believe.We will definately be playing with this outside from now on."
2,Moon sand,What a mess this makes and is overly priced. Once the colors are mixed kids loose interest in it. Would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Neat Idea - Too messy to be worth it.,"The sand itself is a neat idea. Kind of like playing with damp sand. My kids loved it for a while but I think they were really more into the idea of playing with sand inside. Like others mentioned, it's hard to get the sand out of the molds, impossible for a 4 year old. For me, the time my kids spent playing with it wasn't worth the mess they made. I put paper down on the wood kitchen floor and let them play. After they were done and I trashed the paper I still had to vaccum the floor and change their clothes. Not worth it in my opinion."
4,The kids will love this!,"When we first listened to this cd, I would have given it a 1 star. I thought the narration was so cheesy and I was sorry I bought it. The kids liked it though and the second time I reluctantly put it on for them, I thought it wasn't too bad. Now I really like alot of the songs on this cd. They are catchy and well sung. They love the first song, which is an alphabet song, and they not only learn the letters but also different dinosuar names as well. I have found myself singing ""Dem Bones"" out loud at home. The narration is interesting for the kids, and educational as well. My only complaint is the woman who narrates has a fake Southern accent which is really corny because it is so obvious it is fake. Otherwise, this is a great cd for the kids and I'm liking it as well."
3,Most Amazing Dinosaur Songs,This would be a great cd for primary age children who are dinosaur lovers as it involves some role playing & is educational with catchy tunes. Personally I was disappointed as I wanted simple songs for 3-4 year olds.
1,Different formula than found in retail stores. Cats hated it.,"This was a different formula than the Petromalt Malt Flavored Cat Hairball treatment that I purchased at a local pet store that my cats loved. They would not touch this version. I am getting a refund from,the manufacturer."
3,saw no differe ce,"Got this with great excitement, but sadly, the hairballs keep coming. Sure wish I could find something that really works."
5,Very educational,"This is one you will read and study. I find it fascinating as a Bible Study tool. If you are very familiar with the Bible, this is excellent for gathering more in-depth knowledge and to look at the Gospels in perhaps a new perspective. Highly recommended for teachers, small group leaders/facilitators."
4,tapes as ordered,The Tapes arrived. It took a little longer than expected but they were brand new and perform as i would expect. It was nice tofind tapes in good shape for an older camera. My 9 yr old loves playing with this camera and we still get some use out of it also.
5,fun patterns and a hip approach to knitting,"This book is NOT for your great-grandmother. Knitting has come into the 21st century with this book. Women in their 20's and 30's will perhaps be lured into the art of knitting.I knit ten years ago and then stopped. This book inspired me to knit again. The mitten pattern is GREAT and I've also used the pouncho pattern (when I wear my pouncho everybody asks, ""where did you get it?"").FYI, yarn stores have become more modern too. All of these amazing yarns with vibrant colors and soft tectures are available now."
4,"Indeed, a pretty book","full of inspiration and not at all intimidating. I'm a beginner and a perfectionist, and won't try a new pattern if it looks to difficult. Percival is great at telling you what you need to know before you start, and the patterns are rated for difficulty-which I love. I'm disappointed, however, that not all the patterns have accompanying photos. It can be difficult to visualize what a project is supposed to look like, especially for those of us with limited knitting experience. The photos are beautifully simple, uncluttered and calm--just the thing to make you want to pick up your needles."
2,There has to be a better book than this!,"I really feel like this book would be helpful to someone who already knows how to knit. As a beginner, it is not very easy to use. The diagrams are in tiny cicles and are not really readable. There is not much positive I can say about the book other than the cover looks inspiring.Purchase something else... there has to be a better book than this!"
1,Cannot see the pictures,You wouldn't be able to view the finished product since the pictures do not show the knitted project clearly. This book is more for beginners however the pictures should be clearly shown.
3,Didn't work for us,I returned this item because my son is a wild sleeper and the rail on this is not very long. I'm afraid it won't hold him in at night. Other than that this seems like a great product.
4,A good basic workbook,"This is a good book of excercises for the beginner and is meant to be used with a basic textbook. Berlitz has their own language course, but this can be used with any beginners text, and I happen to like the Penguin Russian Course, so I used it with that.I like it because it's reasonably priced and not eye-crossingly difficult. There's a good mix of vocabulary, grammar and word usage excercises. This book requires you to use Cyrillic cursive, but you should be learning that from your textbook. This workbook will give you good practice and a break from the excercises from your main text."
3,"good concept, poor tapes","I used the cassette version and was disappointed. With the tape version I the sound quality was so low that I had a hard time understanding what was being spoken. A native speaker verified the accents to be accurate, so it wasn't the quality of the language, just the shortcomings of the cassette tape. However, I did enjoy the book and found it to be very useful."
4,Relatively light read and a great storyline,"This is one of the better works of WHW. The book is relatively light and moves at a good pace. As with several of WHW's novels, this offers a compelling plot and well developed characters. I really enjoyed this one."
1,Great while it worked,"Shredded single CDs and Credit cards no problem. You could shred 6 or so sheets of paper three or four times then would need to stop due to overheating.I have had it for six months and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. I had shredded about 1/4 of the baskets capacity the night before (3 or less sheets at a time over an hour period). The next day it wasn't working. I removed the shredder part and made sure it was not jammed. I plugged it into a different circuit in my house, still nothing.Very disappointed. I didn't use it often."
5,A gem in Connoisseur's collection!A must have book!,"A wonderful collection of stories from a brilliant storyteller. The kane and abel and prodigal daughter(sequel) has got absolutely superb plot to trod through and author builds up a wonderful climax. Story about persons of integrity, moral, determination and grit. A quiver full of arrows is an astounding collection of short stories. Absolutely terrific stories! Not a penny more is another brilliant plot. Superb storyline The whole collection can be described as ""JUST SUPERB"""
1,paper feed problems,"This is a known issue. Both the rear paper feed and the front document feed develop a problem over time--some pads harden. HP used to offer a free repair kit for this--not anymore. Now some third parties offer kits for 10% of the original purchase price.Add to this the fact that nearly all of the printing function is implemented in the proprietary windows driver, so it's useless for linux, and you can't even download XP drivers (you have to order them on CD--and they're not supported!), and it's just a disaster.HP should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Worked great until it broke.,"Like other reviews, had cable less than a few months then it developed a short in one end. Work fine but for the price I expect the connection ends to be more reliable."
3,Satisfactory reference book,Satisfactory reference book. Would recommend American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Reference Manual instead.
1,Not helpful to a beginner!,"If you are just getting started learning Japanese, you WILL NEED supplementary material to go along with the textbook and workbook! Unless you are taking a class that REQUIRES this particular book, do yourself a favor and find something else. The book has a confusing set-up, and does NOT provide enough background information for a beginner to make sense of the activities. There will be sections instructing you to ""learn this Kanji!"" that do not give the definitions of what those kanji mean, or how they are pronounced, or any other information. Unless you already know a fair bit of the language and are just refreshing, this book will probably make little to no sense to you."
4,"""Come On Over"",a good song. Main reason to buy ""I Turn To U""","Christina Aguilera is vocally a step up above her debut single ""Genie In A Bottle"" with ""Come On Over (Baby)"". But, the song really is just a bonus to me. Another song even further steps up Christina's vocal versatility in ""I Turn To You"", which is also included in an uptempo and upbeat version unlike it's original ballad form. If you like what the world of remixers did for such ballads as N'Sync ""This I Promise You"" and Backstreet Boys ""Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely"" and ""Shape Of My Heart"" then you will like what they did with ""I Turn To You"". ""Come On Over (Baby)"" is also a remix of sorts. It is the Mtv video version a little bit different than the album version. Rather you like Christina or you like the songs ""Come On Over"" and ""I Turn To You"" you will enjoy the best of both worlds with this import."
4,Karloff,Offbeat resonates as much today as when it was made. There is some fool watching and wanting to copycat right now watch this movie and be ready for him.
5,Great Karloff! Great Movie!,"Boris Karloff is stupendous in this low-budget Peter Bogdanovich thriller. (Spoiler)Incorporating footage from THE TERROR and THE CRIMINAL CODE, Karloff is established to be aging horror actor Byron Orlok(a chracter similar to himself in real life). Bogdanovich runs two plot lines into eachother-one with Karloff and another with a psychotic man with a rifle(Tim O'Kelly). He brings them together in a great climactic scene at a drive in theater. Cult film was shot by the great Laszlo Kovacks. It was Bogdanovich's first feature-and a very good one."
5,ABOVE THE CROWD - WAS HISTORY BEING MADE...,Buy and enjoy. It's Mick Jagger... If anyone reading this likes to form an opinion about music please let us know what you have accoplished for 50 years such as Mick or the Stones. Thank you. BUY THIS CD AND ENJOY..
3,its time to burn!!!! Its road rash,"super cool! you get to ride a motorbike, kick, punch and whip with a linked chain!!! there are a bunch of cool things to do on roadrash. you have 4 levels to choose from, and you race 13 other players. of course,there is some super cool glitches, like ramping on a street and and going sky high!!! if you want to speed things up a bit, you can lead your opponents into traps, such as running them in to cars and then YOU run over them with your bike. and if the starter dude you make gets in the back of the line, then just run him over. this game is made for adults! wewe10ton was selling one on amazon but he sold it!!!!!!! missed your chance!!! MWAH HAH WAH HA HA HA HAHHH!!! thank you. have a great day"
1,Don't buy this phone,"I've always had good luck with my GE phones. I saw this one with the 5.4 GHz and thought it was a really good deal for the money. Ummm...not so much. It sounds horrible! Everyone I talk to says I sound like I'm either sick or that there is a horrible echo, I sound too far away, etc. It also gets a lot of interference, which is something my GE 2.4 didn't have trouble with. Looks like it's back to the 2.4 for me."
1,Poor reception!,"I've had this phone for 2 weeks and it gets poor reception, crackles all the time and doesn't have very good range. People say they can't hear me on the other end either. I bought it so it didn't interfere w/ my wireless connection, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. Honestly, I just don't like this phone."
1,Look elsewhere,"This phone has horrible sound quality. The range is even worse.Not much to say but if you get it, you'll have an expensive paper weight."
3,Yngwie's first studio album,"The bad: the songs on this album are the typical ""C"" class metal that was out in the Los Angeles club scene in the early 80's. Yngwie's solos don't even fit the songwriting style. The songs are based on the typical power chords with neo-classical solos blazing through the progressions. The album does encapsulate that period of time though, and that alone might be of some interest.The good: Yngwie's first studio album. Yngwie's amazing guitar work on the intro to ""Hot on Your Heels"". Yngwie gives us a glimpse of the runs that we eventually hear on his later work as well as some great runs that we never hear again.In short, buy it if you're big Yngwie fan. Otherwise, it's not worth the $$."
5,One of the best italian band for american roots music,"Fabrizio Poggi & Chicken Mambo are one of the best italian band for american roots music (see ""Buscadero"" music magazine 1998). With all these artists guest in this cd, like JERRY JEFF WALKER, PONTY BONE, JIMMY LAFAVE and others, they did a great job. In their 3rd record they had also as a guest the famous accordion player ZACHARY RICHARD. It is incredible that an italian band plays so good american music and had so many american artists as guests on their records. They are so good!"
5,My daughter loves this!,"I bought my daughter the aquadoodle basic mat last year. She has used it profusely. The best part is that it dries within about 5 minutes and you can reuse it right away. My daughter isn't very careful with the pen, and we are still on the first one. Don't buy the stamp pad with the shapes though. The shapes have to be soaked to actually work and they only will work once each time you wet it."
4,Great for little ones!!!,"My 2 year old loves this toy!! It is terrific for mom and dad too as you do not have to watch every move they make, it is only water!!! And the inventor of this must have had children, the special ""pen"" opens opposite of most things(you turn it to the right to open and left to close) and so far my 2 year old has not figured this out (and I see him trying to open it)I agree with the review on the roller stamp (with stars and hearts etc) We could not get this to work effectively so my little one prefers to stick with the pens."
2,Interesting yet fightening,I was astonished to read this book to find out how men feel on the subject of the different sexes. I found the book interesting but it can hardly be based on fact. Any author that compares an unemployed man to a raped woman needs to have had the violent experience. I was disturbed but also inclined to read on if only to see what other outlandish statements he would make. I read the book together with my husband and he had a little different reaction than me. While he open my eyes as to what the author was trying to say he also shared some of my opinions on the unresearched claims made by Mr. Farrell. Although I would say it was interesting reading I would hope no one took it as a factual account of the society we live in today.
3,too wordy,"it takes the author too long to get to the point, and to substantiate the points.. . . easy to get tired reading but worth a once over.he writes like the ""stereotypic"" woman talks."
1,Manipulated information and bizarre comparisons.,"Aside from deliberate distortions of well documented facts such as the case of Laurie Dann, I find it impossible to take seriously or have any respect for the opinion of a man who claims to see the genders as equal, yet feels no shame in comparing an unemployed man to a woman who has been raped. It obviously does not occur to him to compare an unemployed man to an unemployed woman, nor does he recognize the significance of rape or that this lack of recognition disproves his point."
4,What a Gem...,"If you are into this genre of music you will really enjoy this CD. The songs I like the most are the ones that are the transitional type going from EBM, and New Beat to Rave.Lots of useless tracks, but the good ones make up for it."
1,Spend the few extra bucks and get an iPod instead,"I've had trouble with this unit from the start. Plugged into the charger but nothing happened (and no troubleshooting instructions came with the unit for this problem). Finally inserted a pin to reset the unit which then recognized the charger was plugged in and charged the battery. Installed the software on my PC, but was never able to load any songs - error msg seemed to indicate the hard drive was not properly initialized - again, no troubleshooting help with the product. It's been a hassle dealing with the helpdesk folks at Rio. I really hate products where you follow their startup instructions to the letter, but the product still doesn't function properly."
1,AAARRGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!,"I am now the sad owner of my second Rio Carbon that fails to work and it appears that I am now out of luck as well as out of music. Rio Carbon #1 had to go to the hospital after the screen went black from being in my pocket during a walk. The customer service rep told me it was not designed to be moved but agreed to replace it since it was still under warranty. Two weeks after the little Ipod Wannabe came back and all its music was put into place, the little volume control knob which also serves to change the mode of operation, shriveled and no longer functions leaving me with a soft playing machine where I can no longer control the volume or the the other functions that the carbon had to offer...$150 bucks plus postage has left me sad and wishing I would have bought a player I could actually use...Bummer"
5,Cute Costume,I bought this costume for my then 2 year old daughter last year and she loved it. She looked so cute in it. The only problem I had with this costume is that the skull brooch is held on by velco...So of course it kept falling off....It would have been better to have it glued or stitched on. Otherwise that we loved it!!!!!
4,cute costume,"this is a very cute and precious costume. i was hoping that i would get to pick the size 4-6, i would have gotten size 4 and then had to still alter it i'm sure. i read a review and the lady said that her 2 year old was able to wear it... must have been a huge 2 year old, b/c it swallows my almost 2.5 year old.we will make do and my mom can alter it. overall it is totally cute on her!!"
4,Relly interesting!,"I had to read this book for my history studies, and I thought it would like most of the others history books I must have to red:boring! But this one isn't like the others:it's interesting,even passionating,sometimes funny! In one word,it's a really good book!"
3,"Moves quickly, but tends to be very redundant.","This 304 page murder mystery could have been condensed into 200 pages. The events leading up to and including the brutal killing of Krintine Smith are chronolicalled in this book by Patricia Springer. The story is excellent. The author is able to grab hold of the reader and keep the suspense building. However, the account reaches a point where the reader wants to shout, ""We've heard this before, stop the rehashing, and get on with the story.""Eventually the story does end. The bad guy gets caught, admits to his crime, and finally becomes incarcerated. The only unresolved issue is where is the body. The author explores several possibilities, but the whereabouts is never uncovered."
1,Knowing an advisor?,"I must admit I got a chuckle out of the section in the book about how to pick and knowing an advisor when you are supposed to see about selecting an advisor to your money. As I understand it, Bold was fined a bunch of money and had to pay former clients for activity of his and so the section sort of should have a mirror attached to it."
3,Poached!,"I read the NYT review and since we love poached eggs, I thought I'd try these. They're fine, although a bit hard to get out of the water. And I think they should be sold in packs of four instead of two."
2,Husband sees no improvement,"I bought this product for my husband at the advice of my sister. He's been taking it every day for about a month - 3 times each day - so far, he's seen no improvement. This might not be due to any fault of the product. He needs surgery on his back. I've heard of people who think it's great. I can neither recommend nor say it doesn't work. It just isn't working for him."
1,don't know if they're any good - I can't swallow the pill!!,"the box promised ""easy to swallow"" - but the actual swallowing proved to be something other than ""easy"". The horse pill lodged half way down my throat. Too far to cough it up and not far down enough to be clear of anything else I might be wanting to swallow. It took a call to the doctor and a few hours of sipping hot liquids to move the damn thing down my pipes. Won't be trying that again. Do you suppose there's some reason to manufacture one giant pill instead of two smaller ones? - Maybe it's cheaper - I dunno."
2,osteo biflex,"Started taking this after a friend of mine raved about how well it works. My wife and I took it for three weeks,. She started having leg pains after the first week and I started having leg and back pain after the second week and when we stopped the pain went away. YOU BE THE JUDGE"
4,Nice product,"When I was a kid I used a high wheel plow in the garden and I had been looking for one for a while before I settled on this one.When I received the unit, it looks like it had been dropped pretty hard and the front wheel was slightly bent but after talking to the supplier, they sent a new one.Before using it, I stained the handles black and it looks really good and should keep the wood lasting longer.Overall I am pleased with the unit and would recommend it."
3,"Solid, but few songs transcend their noisy confines","3 1/2Perhaps overlooked in it's heyday, the album is still cited because of the intelligent post-punk influence which helped create a unique little niche for the band's greatest attempts. Though there are not enough of these attempts to justify brilliance, at their best Jawbox can take the surging progression of a good power chord like King's X and mash it together with menacing, experimental type noise more akin to Nirvana. The few songs that are more developed show a sensitive and gripping massacred pop mentality that far outshine the more mechanical pacing coming from the majority of latter tracks."
1,riddled with poison,"from Million Dollar Baby:The Emily Changer Drawer model #M4715/M4755 ([...]) will have MDF in the drawer bottoms and back panel.The Emily Changing Table model #M4702 ([...]) will have MDF in the shelves, changer surface and drawer bottom.I hope that this was more clear.Thanks,Eric"
2,Horrible instructions,"The instructions for this table don't indicate orientation for the parts. Make sure you read the strap and drawer sections before starting to build, or you'll have to move the rails a few times."
1,Fine as long as your baby is potty trained by 12 months,"We purchased this table to match the Kalani crib. It is a pretty color and the drawers/shelves are functional. If your child is potty trained before 12 months or 20#, I think this would be a good purchase.However, as other reviews have mentioned, the MDF is very flimsy. My baby is now 15 months and 24 pounds, and the table is unusable because the MDF is so bowed the drawer containing the diapers does not even open. My husband had to reverse-engineer some metal brackets and slats to put on the frame to make it functional. Be warned!"
4,Sturdy enough,"The changing table have a good size and is sturdy enough to hold my baby, since I was worry for my baby (who is already 22 pounds and very long). I hope he can use it at least for a year."
1,Don't waste your money!,Wish I'd seen the other review before buying this. My old aluminum pan is easier to clean than this one. I've used this pan several times and it's going into the trash today. Food burns into the indents in the pan and it's impossible to get off. The cooking surface of the pan always feels sticky. I've tried soaking overnight and scrubbing the heck out of it with a pad meant for nonstick surfaces. No luck. What a waste of money!
2,Good CD but scary lyrics,"This CD by Armor for Sleep has a really good beat and I really liked it when i was listening to it but when I read the lyrics, I was very disturbed. All the lyrics are about death and dying and it's very weird. Good for you if you're into that but not for me. It's a shame because the bands SOUNDS really cool but the lyrics suck."
1,bad,thi is a good cd for you if you love to hear a stuffy nosed baby wine and it dosent fit with the music
5,This album tops the first,This album definitely tops their first effort which was mediocre at best. I decided to give them another chance I bought the album and I was blown away. It a smooth fresh punk beat with every song being above average. With the exception of Basement ghost singing which was sorta' like they first album. If you love punk then you must buy the album if you don't buy the album. It has a variety of smooth and hard beats perfect for any listener.Top Five Tracks:1. Car Underwater2. The End of a Fraud3. The Truth About Heaven4. Kind of Perfect5. A Quick Little Flight
5,couldn't put it down,"Julianna Baggott's first novel is a wild ride into the past with Lissy Jablonski as she attempts to figure out her life. Raucous and bizarre characters fill the pages as the plot tumbles forward. But it's more than just action, Baggott's poetic sensibility serves her well, at times making the reader ache. Baggott leads us on an odyssey and when we have returned home, we find we've got new family members, as whacky and honest as our own."
5,Chante Piaf,"the songs of the great Edith Piaf by Mireille Mathieu.One of the few women who can do justice to her fellow countryman is Mireille who led the next generation of great French singers.many of the ""Little Sparrow"" greatest songs up to and including Le Vie en Rose are in this CD and it is a must have for fans who collect only the best of French music."
3,Received expired eggs!,I have used this product before and it was great! The packets I received through one of the many sellers on amazon came about 6 months after the expiration date written on the label.The expiration date doesn't mean they won't work but it does mean that there will be fewer eggs that hatch.
1,Inaccurate,"The sections on ME (CFS) and Fibromyalgia are inaccurate. The author states that there is no soft tissue pain in ME!! And says ME and Fibro patients are ""hypervigilant' to sensory stimuli (because they were traumatized). There is central sensitization in ME/FMS due to encephalopathy/encephalitis caused by an overactive immune system and perhaps viral infection, but this represents frank physical damage to the brain not hypervigilance."
1,beware,"The description says 6ct, but you only receive one pen. You can go to your local office supply store and purchase one pen for $6.99."
2,boring,"if this book is (as many people call it) the best work of Zola i can'timagine how boring his other books must be...this ENTIRE book is like the part in Kafka's ""the trial"" where Josef K's lawyer explains the system, and how the trial will result... other than that part i would say Kafka is great... read ""the trial"" instead of the dram shop..."
2,Silly but cool Robots,"I saw this in High School, when i was first getting into anime. It was one of the ones I came across in the video store and picked it up cause it had some cool robots on the cover. The story is lacking and very rushed but the action is pretty cool. Unfortunately it is very much the enemy of the day format but each robot is pretty unique as are the pilots and their indivicual psychoses. If you want some mindless robot action pick up Hades Project Zeorymer."
4,Scalp Relief,A surprisingly great hair product and good price. I first thought using this would really dry out my scalp and hair. BUT my hair is smooth and silky. My husband used it as well and the excess flaking he was experiencing has been eliminated completely! I will buy again.
4,Not bad.,"It is a fine product. Very light...I thought it was going to be a little sturdier, but it really doesn't matter. It does the job."
1,"Wow, how boring!!!","This book was one of the most boring books I've ever read, and I have to admit many times I kept asking myself why I continued to read it. The whole story was about the two main characters' thoughts with nothing much else happening. In fact without the thoughts of the two characters, the whole story line could have been told in probably less than 10 pages. What a waste of paper."
5,Wonderful!,I enjoyed this book very much! Once I started it I couldn't put it down until I was done. It is very accurate historically and has a wonderfully entertaining storyline. The characters are addictive and believable. Another great story by a very talented writer!
4,Ardell unred,My wife told me about the product and that this was a very good price. She has used it once and is happy with the results
2,...no difference.,"This did absolutely nothing, brassy tones are not reduced at all. Cant really say any more about it than that."
5,The game is fantastic,"My six year old son and I have played this game. I use the term game loosely. The creators have made teaching basic mechanics into a fun James Bond type of game. The child must complete mechanical puzzles on each level, from basic paths of people and vehicles, to projectiles, or even computer generated mirrors and lasers.I highly recommend this game."
5,"Funny, captures the humor of the Christmas season","A fun album to put on around the holiday season. The rock tunes sound a lot like the original artist's that recorded the original songs. I hear ""I am Santa Claus"" (A.K.A.) ""Iron Man"" on the radio every year and I always think it is ""Iron Man"""
5,Going into business for the first time,"I'm very pleased with my Ultimate Business Planner purchase. It was just what I needed! The reason I purchased the software is because my Business Plan Pro was horribly difficult to work with, so I returned it. Ultimate Business Planner allowed me to complete my business plan and financial forecast in a fashion that is easy for me to explain to potential investors. I'm attempting to start a business for the first time and I cannot tell you how difficult the financial planning end of things has been. Ultimate Business Planner made it a simple process for me. I would definitely recommend this software to anyone looking to start a business."
4,defining the psychedelic era,This is one of the few groups of the psychedelic era whose musicianship was equal to their ambition. They delve into all sorts of musical genres and invent a couple of their own. If you like the '60s psychedelic sound as well as the quirkiness of lesser known groups like the Incredible String Band or Jim Kweskin these guys deserve a listen. Good headphones are the order of the day!
5,Awesome quality,I ordered this for my screen printing needs and was immediately amazed at the quality of the transparency it made...the only issue i found was while using it in my inkjet the ink took days to dry completely so i just use it in my laserjet instead and the results couldnt be any better even by a commercial standard!!!the shipping was very fast and there were no issues needed to be spoken to the seller about.Overall it is a perfect product and i will be buying from this seller again!!!
3,Someone tried making a movie.,"I love Zombie flicks. This had the makings of a great film but someone decided to turn it into to a cry for help, because it's obvious that the director is clearly under the influence of drugs. The acting was solid and the plot was decent. I could have made a better movie with two broken arms and an etch-a-sketch."
3,The move Extinction,Just another take on the Zombie thing except at the end andI had hoped for a lot more. The twist on nuclear power plants added something that others like this just miss.
3,Good Enough,"Always fascinated by end-of-the-times films. This film was no different than most that I have watched, but it kept my interest. Plan to definitely watch again to analyze it more closely."
5,"Clarissa, Clarissa, Clarissa","Finally, FINALLY, Katherine Harris gets what's coming to her! As a Sarasota County Republican tired of having her rammed down my throat, all I can say is: Mr. Date, I salute you!"
1,"""Leftist"" is an understatement","I want my money back! I should have read Amazon's description better, but since Speed Week was good I figured this book couldn't be too bad. I was wrong. I bought this and the one that rips on Disney. Date comes across as bitter, and I wish I didn't contribute to his success. It's as if James Carville himself wrote this book."
5,Great Read,I had read this author before and wanted to read the rest of her Charlotte Graham mysteries. Books are well written.
5,Very Useful book,"This book is a practical guide for anyone who has a child or works with students with autism. It not only provides the basics of using behavioral modification (which is an evidenced based approach to helping students with autism) but it gives great samples of goals that can be used for children with autism as they progress through elementary school. It offers practical interventions for typical autistic behaviors such as self stimulation, difficulty with changes in routine, and sensory issues. As a school psychologist I found this book very helpful in giving teachers ideas that they can implement easily in their classrooms. For parents, it offers suggestions for how to manage behaviors and how to help your child be integrated into the regular education classroom. I would recommend this book for parents, special education teachers, regular education teachers, and school psychologists.Lisa Bates, PhDSchool Psychologist"
5,Awesome material.,"I used this textbook as part of my required college course, and the information is an absolute godsend. These are mainly reading strategies that have been found to help deaf students improve their reading comprehension skills. The strategies cover all spectrums of teaching approaches - bottom-up, top-down, whole language, etc. and are easily fit into your teaching style.I am currently interning in a deaf classroom, and at least once a week I flip through the book for strategies and ideas to try with my students. This is one of the few textbooks that I have kept from my college courses - it is a gold mine of ideas and information. Highly recommended."
5,Great for Thomas Fans,This is an excellent alarm clock for any Thomas and Friends fan. The design is simple and it has the classic alarm clock ring (it actually rings against the two bells you see on top). It will wake even sound sleepers. Plus it doesn't have a snooze button. Great for getting the kids out of bed in the morning!
3,Shrill and loud.. but works,"Got this for my Thomas-loving 5 year old boys to keep them in bed until 7 every morning. The alarm is old fashioned and the sound is too shrill and loud for my ears. The alarm startles and wakes my boys as well. In that sense it achieves it purpose of getting even the deepest of slumberers to wake up. However,I wish they made something with a sweeter sound or may be like Thomas's tweet for the same price. It is pretty durable, one of my boys dropped it and only a bit of the plastic covering the battery chipped without affecting the functionality. I am using this to teach my boys to read the clock old style."
5,Amazing experiance,"Great product, amazing results, awesome packaging and in perfect condition. Love the product..my only wish would be faster sending and shipping..Thanks for a great transaction!!"
3,Not a bad book,"First of all, I would like to say that this is not a bad book, but I personally found that many of the examples were a little hard to follow. I felt that in many cases steps seemed to be left out, and it was assumed that you would know how to get to these points in the examples that were shown in the book. Unfortunately in my case the professor teaching our statistics class really does not seem to care to follow the material in the book. He's not a bad buy, but I'm not so sure he should be teaching statistics. In addition we use Microsoft Excel and the Megastat add-in on some of the example problems. So what happens is that the answers I get vary depending on whether I follow the book, my professor, or the Megastat program. All of this adds up to massive confusion on my part, and on the part of my fellow classmates."
3,Good not Great,This was an ok buy...first of all it was already quite used and therefore not really worth much.....it was the correct item I ordered and it came in a timely fashion. Overall about 3.5 stars.
3,50/50,"This is the first book of Susan Donovan that I have read, and I can honestly say, it kept me page turning, and I finished it in two days. The characters are sweet, and witty...Im just disappointed that he (Theo) didn't love her cuz of her weight, but inspite of it. I wish she had been a proud BBW and not appologyzing to anyone cuz of her size. If the author had kept her big through out the story, I think I would have rooted for Lucy and Theo a lot more, than feeling she 'sold out', to win the hot man."
3,Nothing exceptional,"Ok, but not too exceptional. It wasn't a thrilling book for me. Not an exciting read. Just plain ok."
2,Average read,Just wasn't interesting enough. Not enough spice for me to fall in love with the main couple. I couldn't fall in love with the guy. The whole concept and storyline fell flat.
1,I don't love Lucy,"I thought I would enjoy this book. It started out wonderful. The preview was witty and fun. I love chick lit. The reviews all raved about this book.Lucy is 5'7 and 100lbs over weight? What does that mean? The weight range for a female who is that tall (that is tall because the avg height for a female in the US is 5' 3"") is 127 to 158lbs. Which means Lucy can be anywhere from 227 to 258lbs. Now if she is 227 she really might be only 60lbs overweight not 100.The second problem I had was when they were doing Lucy's fitness eval. It feels like the author didn't even bother with even asking a physical trainer what they do when they do an eval. They don't put people in a tank of water to see how much of a person's weight is fat. All the need to do is step on a special scale that computes that.I couldn't even finish the story. I was 9% in and gave up. I returned it on Amazon. I wonder did the author even do any research?"
5,Excellent guage,"This is the second one I've purchased. I have multiple motorcycles, bicycles, trailers, etc. Seems like the gauge is in the truck when I'm in the garage, or in the garage when I'm on the road. Having two is the solution. The only drawback is the gauge has to be pushed straight down on the valve. Any sideways movement leaks air. Highly recommend."
2,"Decent gauge for the price, not racing quality.",The gauge works ok. It reads very accurately while you are holding it tight on the valve stem. It drops a tenth or two when you take it off.It is perfectly fine as a very accurate pressure gauge for normal or professional use. This is not what I would consider a high quality RACING gauge.Also the chuck would be easier to use if it where a 90 degree end. Guess you need to spend the money for a racing gauge.
2,"Slow to bleed, powers off automatically, not a good racing gauge","First, the positives.1) Excellent visiblity from the display.2) Seems ruggedly constructedNow the negatives1) The air bleed button bleeds air way too slowly. If you're actually using this gauge for racing and only have a couple minutes to bleed air from your tires, you will be hard pressed to do it with this gauge.2) The unit powers off after about a minute. There is no way to disable it. That means if you're in the process of bleeding air it may power off, requiring you to unclip the hose from the valve, bleed the unit, hit ""on"" and start over. Very frustrating.Overall, it works fine as an air gauge, but for competition... no way."
1,Not worth the high price,"Much has been written about this product, and I have nothing to add other than the reason for my one star review. The gauge wouldn't seal on any of the tires on either of my cars. Readings were erratic, inconsistent, in short, useless. Also beware if you have short valve stems, as the gauge seems to require longer ones. In my case that made little difference, so I've returned it."
4,LGL Memphis,"THIS TIRE GAUGE IS VERY ACCURATE AND EASY TO USE. THEDISPLAY IS BACKLIT AND EASY TO READ WITH A BARGRAPH ASWELL AS A LARGE DIGITAL READOUT. I DO WISH THE AUTOOFF FEATURE WAS A LITTLE LONGER. TENDS TO CUT OFFWHEN I AM TAKING A NEW READING, BUT OVERALL VERY GOOD."
4,Accurate and Easy to Use,"I love this tire guage. It must be the angle of the valve stem on my wheels, but I have a hard time getting guages to connect correctly. This straight stem connection and clip make checking the tire pressure easy now. I thought that I wouldn't like the digital display, but it grew on me in no time. My only complaint is that sometimes I have to reset the guage when checking multiple tires in quick succession. No big deal really. I had to relieve the pressure in my old one before checking the next tire, too. As with all precision instruments, use kid gloves with this thing. One bad drop will kill it, just like any other tire pressure guage."
3,GOOD GAUGE BUT I HAD TO FIX,"I really like the gauge and its accuracy. However, the very thin positive wire that is attached to a metal piece that contacts the batteries broke. It wasn't hard to fix with a little bit of solder, but it should be made a little better than this for the money. Now that it's soldered, it's working great again and I use it often."
2,not accuate,It is not accurate enough for my needs and not equil to the other gauges that I already have and use
1,"Looks fancy, but has no value on the track.","This gauge makes one (probably very precise) measuring. The problem is that the display does not follow the current pressure after the initial reading.When bleeding excess air from the tires to reach a certain pressure you make a reading, let some air out, remove the gauge, empty the trapped air from the gauge, attach the gauge again, make a new reading, let some more air out, remove the gauge again, release the trapped air, attach it again, make another reading .... the device looks cool, but has no real value.I'd recommend getting a good quality mechanical gauge instead."
5,This rings TRUE!,"I read this book after starting the Prism weight loss program, and it was so insightful, clear & motivating! Others I recommended it to found it extremely helpful as well. If you have a problem with weight or relationships, you will find great comfort and practical advice in this book. It even included encouraging info on how to deal with friends & family who are hurtful or who feel hurt by your change in diet. I recommend this as a good read for learning to eat a healthier diet in general too. Everyone could benefit!"
5,Excellent film,"A very entertaining film, with exciting film footage interspersed with player interviews. It may seem at first like a time capsule, of more interest to former college students or football players from the 1969 era, but the tension builds and the game footage gets more and more compelling. It's also an excellent story about team spirit, character, and the emotional reality of the Vietnam era. By the end, and its incredibly dramatic finish, it's a movie that should be required viewing for everyone who thinks they know something about football, or really just for everyone, period."
1,Harvard Beats Yale 29-29,Always double check your purchases. I didn't know I was buying a Blu Ray version. This movie is worthless to me.
2,"Flavorful, but difficult to store and use","I had been using this product to make homemade Nicaraguan chorizo. This product is indeed flavorable and authentic. However, I found that it dries out and hardens before I have the chance to use all of it, even if kept in the plastic bag it's packaged in and then sealed inside a Tupperware container. For this reason, I now order annatto (achiote) powder instead, and add additional flavorings to it, according to a recipe in one of my Nicaraguan cookbooks. I figure I can't get more authentic than to use a cookbook that was published in Nicaragua (not here in the States) and use the exact ingredients the recipe calls for. I can also control the ingredients to avoid unnecessary preservatives and such."
5,Amazing!!,Awsome show. Very addicting. Jr is the best bad guy period. Its so sad that larry hagman died. I domt kno how its gomna be from now on with season two. But ill still watch. Even though hes the reason why i watch. Anyway give the new dallas a shot!! Its great :)
5,Never has being bad been so good to watch!!!,I was working my way through the original Dallas series and discovered this series. It's great to see that JR has not lost anything with age. The new generation are surprisingly good as well - and this is from someone who rarely watches any current TV shows as I do not find the plots or acting interesting. My only regret is the season was too short. Looking forward to more drama and back stabbing next season.
3,Good ole trashy escapism!,"I don't have to think, good way to just veg out and let the work stress go. I love J.R.!!! I don't know that I'll watch the next season since he's gone."
5,Dallas is BACK!!!!!!!!,"TNT revived Dallas last night and the show featuring Josh Henderson, plus classic J.R., Bobby, and Sue Ellen! If you didn't see this, you totally missed out on the next chapter of a show that took the world by storm."
4,THE SHOW MUST GO ON............,"Dallas: 2012 Season was GREAT!!!! All the elements, old & new, are there. JR, Bobby, Sue Ellen, Cliff Barnes, Ray, & Lucy are the foundation to presenting the next generation of wheeling & dealing. Good stuff. Sadly, Mr. Hagman passed away during the filming of the second season (only 6 episodes he filmed) due end of January 2013. As they say in show business, ""the show MUST go on."" and I think it will despite JR's end. Long live Dallas!!!!"
2,Rio Carbon Pearl 5 GB MP3 Player,"Hard item to review. It has lots of great features and pleasing design , but I had to send two different players back for shorting out and becoming unresponsive. That said, my husband hasn't had a bit of trouble with his Rio Carbon, so I decided to try a third one. Three weeks in and my 6 GB Pearl is doing fine. I'm keeping my fingers crossed"
1,West Hollywood? More like Encino!,"I do not live in the sunshine state, but, if this movie is any idea of what life is like in West Hollywood, I'd rather live under the HOLLYWOOD sign! What a piece of tripe! The story stinks (what was it about again?) and the acting is just plain lousy!!! DO NOT spend your hard earned money on this or the West Hollywood Stories 2 movie. Spend it on a classic like ""Sunset Blvd."" or ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" or, if you're hungry to see hot men, go to the baths."
5,Doesn't get any better,"So few musicals are available on DVD, but this is one of the greatest. From creative team to cast, you really can't beat the original cast of Into the Woods. A must have for anyone who loves musical theatre and wants to see how good it can be."
1,not good,"The tape was damaged in a couple parts of the movie and it made it hard to watch. i ended up renting from netflix. i should have done that from the get go, i would have saved myself time and money."
4,Good play!,I thought this movie of the play was amazing! The songs were well written and was a great performance!
5,The Best,"I'm a teenager, and I LOVE this video! This is the first Sondheim play I've ever seen and it is excellent, especially the first act. Joanna Gleason and Bernadette Peters are great as the Baker's Wife and the Witch, as well as Chip Zien as the Baker. I recommend this humorous video to anybody who still reads fairytales as I do!"
4,Grimm's Fairytales Revisted,"Take your favorite Grimm's Fairytales--throw them in a blender and hit MIX! Steven Sondheim does a teriffic job mixing Rapunzel, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, etc. into a magical funfest. But the best part is Part Two--What happens after ""Happily Ever After"" Enjoy the original B'Way Production with Bernedette Peters as the Witch (and such a WITCH she is!!!!)"
1,Incredibly Disappointed,"I love ""Into The Woods,"" but this review is because of the lack of information for Amazon Instant Video.To save time and a few dollars, I purchased the Instant Video version under the impression that I would be able to burn the film onto a disk, view it on my phone, and watch it on my television through the use of the cloud or my PS3. I was unable to view it through any, and feel as though I wasted the money just to be capable of watching it on my computer - which I could have done for free through YouTube.I would recommend just buying the dvd."
3,No captioning,Always has been one of my favorite musicals but this version has no captioning of any sort so my girlfriend was unable to fully enjoy it. She has hearing loss and is often unable to make out the words in movies without captioning although she can enjoy the music. Otherwise it is 5 stars if you can hear just fine.
4,A fairy tale to watch,"This is great musical play I've seen in a long while. The cast is superb and the music is smart and funny. This is one of the best cast for I play I've seen so far. This is basically about a bunch of fairy tales told as one story. It's very smart and funny. Lessons to be learned from. If you haven't seen this yet, ""Oh the agony"" of it all you're missing a great tale. I highly recommend watching.The downside to this, is that the quality of the video is outdated. It looks like it was transferred from VHS straight to DVD with nothing to touch it up. Not to mention this is over a decade old. The menu although, simple is just the scenes broken up. There's no extras on this DVD which is a disappointment. Would love some extras of how this came about and what not."
4,Of course you'll love Bernadette Peters.,"And I suppose you'll fall in love with Little Red Riding Hood, too, as I did."
4,Weber Style Professional-Grade Vegetable Basket,"This is NOT a discount store grill basket. I use this for all types of items on the grill. I even line it with foil to get a different result, with the deep dish doing all the work. Pop it in the DW when done. Comes back brand new."
2,Does not make a difference,I couldn't see any difference in the quality of photos or videos using the monopod. Trying to follow a moving object by turning the monopod in place resulted in shaky videos.Manfrotto 676B DIGI Aluminum Monopod (Black)For the rest of my trip I used my point and shoot Panasonic Z3 camera without the monopod.
4,"Cool, but they sound like someone else","I LOVE the song I Swear, but the first time I heard it, I could have sworn it was 'N Sync! One of the guys sounds so much like Justin Timberlake! Otherwise, it's such a neat CD"
2,Not worth your time,"I thought the addition of the occult, a ghost, psychic powers and auras would be a interesting change to a romance novel. Unfortunately Jill Jones did not make it work. I found the two main characters boring and I never did figure out when they feel in love. Don't waste your time. Read ""Breath of Magic"" instead."
2,I thought I would try something new,I am growing bored with the usual romance novel. I thought I would try something new & wish I hadn't. I felt kind of creepy reading this one. Good magic/bad magic really did NOTHING for me. The chemistry between the two leads is never really there. No character development. Left me feeling kind of icky. I must not be ready for the occult type romances.
5,Great for fun on the go!,"I just got mine today, actually about an hour ago. This thing comes ready to go right out of the box. And it is just so easy to work! I will be using this primarily on the go, with my Optoma Pico PK-101 pocket projector. I am actually going to use this at work today to watch some dvds. Once I receive some cables I had ordered I will be using this portable rig to play games and watched dvd's with my (hacked) Nintendo Wii. Fun anywhere!"
5,Can't beat the value here,"My company holds regular seminars and we've been using this screen for several months now, and we're very happy with it.It has a sleek, minimalistic design.It's very affordable.The screen really brings out colors and contrast in what you're displaying.It's easy to open and setup, and easy to break down. Very portable.It's a comfortable size--not too big and not too small.It can be adjusted for 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios.I'm using it withViewSonic PJD5122 SVGA DLP Projector, and I'm very happy with my setup."
3,For the price it could be more durable,"The screen looks great and seems sturdy at first but after repeated use, it starts sagging at the top. Also, the adhesive that holds it to its roll gave out on one side and I had to duct tape it back together in a bind. Last, it's very heavy. It's the plastic casing that probably makes it so heavy. If you're carrying a lot of stuff, this thing is going to get cumbersome. You'll have to check it if you're traveling. It's pretty big. I wouldn't get it again. The cheaper screens are just as good and they're way lighter."
3,Not My Cup Of Tea,Upon opening the screen I noticed small holes in the screen from screws behind the screen and creases in the screen where the center is not rolled up on the two side rollers. It is a little akward to setup and repack but not bad. The creases are not visible when used with a projector. I sent this one back and went for a conventional pull down.
3,hole in screen,"Upon receiving the screen I saw that there was a hole in the screen. Due to the fact of shipping and how often I need to use it, I kept it. Not very happy with it though. I will get a tripod screen next time."
5,Epson Duet projector screen,Great product. Its very easy to set up and very portable. Projector shows well on screen. Highly recommend this anyone wanting a projector screen.
1,Apologies to The Virginian.,"This is a depressing western novel in which the main character robs a bank, kills some innocent people, kills some bad people and falls in love with a woman who is not exactly one of the upright ladies of the old west. None of the people in this book have any redeeming qualities except the Indians and the posse chasing the main character, Tom. This is little more than Bonnie and Clyde on horse back. The writing was okay and the plot did have me engaged, but I kept hoping the ""hero"" would get caught by the posse and strung up from a high limb of the nearest tree. The point of the story is that we should feel sympathy for him. I didn't. It would have been an interesting story if the marshall chasing this guy would have been the main character. Some of the characterizations are well drawn, but most were people I wouldn't want to hang around-even in a book. I must add that I like westerns and edgy characters, but this was not worth my time or yours."
3,Good info but condensed...,"I found the step by step procedures a little too condensed & simplified. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the instructions will definitely get you through a a particular repair job with little hiccups. Nevertheless, I'd still highly recommend this manual to all Previa owners. It'll be money well spent. Guaranteed."
2,Wrong formulation...,"I am unable to use this product because it has green tea in it, and I am allergic. I thought I had ordered the original formula, butI guess Not because I got the X32. I have used the original trimspa formulation in the past (2005) and it worked great, wish I had gotten the right one this time...."
5,glamorise womens seamless molded wonderwire support,I love this bra and need 20 more. Thank you. It us true to size and very comfortable unlike some other wireless bras.
5,another great panddolfi album,"I have purchsed 16 of Pandolfis' albums, so unfortunately my reviews will get repetitive. If you like piano, get any of his albums."
1,Hapkido: an introduction to the art of self-defense,"Not very helpful, too many references to the authors other 1163page book throughout the entire book.Very vague and a difficult 'introduction', but some really good pictures.I wouldnt refer it to anyone."
5,Classic game returns in the best version yet!,"I've played literally every version of Dragon's Lair in existence (even the old coleco versions). And by far the DVD versions are the best. It still might not be as perfect as the original laser disc version, as far as timing of the moves go, its real close and I found myself just watching the full length movie anyway. I never realized how much of an improvement in animation and detail there was for Lair 2. Each level also has a barrage of moves, sometimes one every second. Excellent job."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This printer is awful. It's what I get for trying to save money.First, I've never seen a printer use this much ink. The money you saved on the printer will be returned to Lexmark in spades with ink cartridges.Finally, when this clunker stopped printing in color, forget about technical support. The printer's troubleshooter is the worst I've ever seen for any hardware. The company's website stinks too.Perhaps coincidentally, my first Compaq (now Lexmark)printer found its way into the garbage, but lasted 2 1/2 years. This one made it about 6 months. Do yourself a big favor and spend a few more bucks on a higher-quality printer. I would advise against Lexmark."
1,Piece of junk,"This printer is a piece of junk. The software with it sucks, the printer is slow, and the print quality is bad. The ink cartriges are expensive (they are worth more than the printer itself now!). The printer insists upon cutting off the last half inch of text or it prints in the wrong way. The ink cartrige get very bad life.Beware this printer!"
1,junk,"Uses ink at an alarming rate. Plastic breaks with little or no exertion.Finally just not printing. & With no suggestion as to what to doand with the company closing out, nowhere to go for suggestions.Before or after, just Junk! Not even Microsoft has a valid drivers list at XP era.good luck with yours!"
5,fire!!!!!,"this album is blazin' hot his last album ""e.l.e."" i was very dissapointed in that but that's a ok album but his new album he so great he took time on this and it's hot.my fav song on this album is ""the heist"" off the hook but i also love 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,18,19,20,21 the whole album is hot start to finish just ignore the intro and outro then you will be just fine."
2,Let me just say,"Busta bus has had some kick grass CD's like ELE & Genesis. But this is just average. When I first heard it I thought it was crap, then after a couple listens to, it was aight.All it is really is a bunch of one beat songs with a bunch of fricken cussing (...) It still has it's good tracks but it seems like busta wanted it to have an a below underground vibe."
4,Busta Rhymes - Anarchy,"I think this is a very good CD. It as good as, if not better than, his last album. It carrys over some of the same kinds of beats as Busta's old stuff while mixing in some new stuff. This is one of those CDs that you can listen to all of the way through. I also liked Busta in his performance in Shaft which is a pretty good movie."
5,One of da best,This is one of Bustas greats. Even thought i dont like anarchists...Busta hits number one on my list...especially the begginning intro which is really funny and songs like fire. This CD features the musical talent of rappers like Ghost Face Killah and DMX. Well till next time.
4,BUY THIS CD!,"WOW! This album is one of the best. Busta is totally wild! This cd hace over 20 tracks, and I have to say, i like more than 2/3 on it! On this cd, there are many other musicians too! Lenny Kravitz, DMX, and Jay-Z are just to name a few. There is swearing on the songs, but if you are buying the album, it doesnt really matter. His music is a definite rap, but all of the songs have a great beat that is great to listen to or dance to! If you like Busta, or if you like any rap/pop, i highely recommend buying this CD"
2,The Same Old Busta,This Disc is Really not much different then His Other Albums.His Formula doesn't really change that much.While He has alot of Energy&Flow at different times through out his Disc's Nothing Really Different Comes Ringing Out.for me he spends more time at crafting Songs Geared at Videos than Crafting solid Songs Too Groove to.He Needs too Try Something Different cuz Cuz this has been already done by Him.the Beats aren't Strong all the way.Cool Having Lenny Kravitz but he Should Had that kind of Vibe more so on this Disc.Busta has Talent but he has too Challenge it more so.
2,I wonder why tha hell I purchased this CD,"Listen, very few tracks are good. The rest of this album sounds like gibberish. Sorry but Busta Rhymes is washed up!"
2,Really Didn't Do It For Me,"I'm not sure why, but old school Busta Rhymes just doesn't interest me. His songs are too chaotic and his lyricism is just uninspired. ""Fire"" and ""The Heist"" are decent tracks, but otherwise, this album is instantly forgettable. Maybe I just can't appreciate this style of rapping..."
2,Slightly disappointed,"I was disappointed with this CD. There are some good songs, but I didn't care for a good number of them. Unfortunately, Busta didn't get it done in this album. His other three albums were much better."
2,What?,"I think that Busta's best work has already come and that this stuff isn't Busta anymore. I think Busta is trying to conform more to what rap is now, which is lazy and done without much thought. Busta is better than that, and better than this! What happened to the energetic Busta who had all of the crazy, colorful videos? That was the real Busta, that was when he really had style. Now all we get is Busta standing in front of the camera wearing his own hip-hop label. It was cool when he was creative and wore all of the costumes. Anybody can stand in front of a camera wearing some label. Busta used to be better than that."
4,Vortura: One of Bailter's best,"Although ""Vortura"" may not be as smashing and essential as ""Robot World"" it still contains some unforgettable tunes where Alister's sugar sweet vocals are complemented with a blazing wall of noise which makes damaging your eardrums an almost pleasant activity. No discography of Bailter Space should leave ""X"" and ""Shadow"" unmentioned. Songs which made me want to go and see them live and ever after. I loved this album back in '95 when I bought it and I still love it now."
5,Had it forever,"I have had this album it seems like forever and I still listen to it from time to time. This is one of the best ""first efforts"" by a band I have ever heard."
1,Disappointing and poor video quality,"For a city called the ""Queen of the Adriatic"", Venice deserves a better tour video than this one. This tape is in fact more slide show than video, as there is no real moving footage - just a limited selection of photographs shown (often repeatedly!) beneath a rather overdramatic narration. The picture quality is not even very clear and colors are washed out, making it difficult to appreciate the supposed beauty of the city at the focus of this production.While some of the highlight attractions of the city are shown and some of its history is discussed, there is little focus at all on the artwork of the city, and not much information that will be useful to those planning a visit."
1,Worst kindle book I have ever purchased,If I didn't need this book for a class I would demand a return. Can't even access the book by chapter. I spend a lot of time trying to find the right page. No continual it's between the print copy and this piece of junk. Wish I would have bought the print copy.
5,My most used Leslie workout...,"I have become a follower of Leslie within the last year or so. This 2 mile program is the one I use most often, either I do it on it's own or I add it to my weight training. It's a nice little program, it's easy to follow and the time goes pretty fast and before you know it, you have walked 2 miles! Living in a place that gets really cold in the winter, I don't have an excuse to not do my walks!This walk is standard Leslie, you see the walking in place, side steps, knee lifts and kicks, she also adds double side steps and hamstring curls (kickbacks), along with assorted arm movements. Later on in the program she and her walkers go grab their weighted balls. There is one person who doesn't use them, so I always follow her as I do weight training separately.Thanks to Leslie I am back to exercising, maybe not as consistently as I would like, but I am getting there. Regardless, I am grateful to have found her workouts. They will hold a permanent place in my collection."
5,MacAlly Firewire enclosure,"On two separate occasions I've purchased the PHR-100AF enclosure. Both times the results exceeded my hopes. They are easy to put into service--the hard disk mounting is a snap and all hardware is provided. They are thermally satisfactory without an internal fan, they look good, and the activity light is very visible."
3,Good,"This works well and installed fairly easily. It is much heavier than the original equipment I had, which seems good, but it is also more to carry weight-wise when working in the yard! When you are old like me, weight matters! That is why I only gave it 3 stars!"
5,Miracle of love,"I left my ex-boyfriend because of this book. The Initiation made me feel worthwhile and important. For the first time in my life, I experienced God inside. This threatened Ralph because he liked me when I was full of problems.I like the new me and I'm looking forward to really living. Thank you Marilyn and Donald and Inner Ocean!"
5,The Initiation,"Every once in while a book comes along that feels like an explosion of light and sound. When that happens, I pay attention. The Initiation is one of those books. The story in The Initiation tells about Donald Schnells trip to India, meeting with the deathless Maha Avatar, Babaji, and ultimate initiation into the Ancient Order of Swamys as Prema Baba Swamiji; It has all the power of Autobiography of a Yogi,yet the events it describes occurred in 1997 to a Westerner who is alive and willing to witness to the story. Prema Baba Swamijis adventures are recounted with great sensitivity,humor and candor."
1,fabrication,"the author plays Americas favorite game, called pretense. From the start I did not believe the claim that the CD of his account was found accidentally; this book is clearly written to ensnare buyers, if not ""disciples"". Having traveled in India as a woman, and considering the practical biological plumbing of a male, his going on about Indian toilets seems all too exaggerated. There is little that can't be misused for self-aggrandizement, including stolen quotes. If he had packaged this as a fairy tale, I would have given him three stars. If one wants to read about real initiation, try Irina Tweedies ""Daughter of Fire""."
5,silence,"An embodiment of Babaji's Premananda, Prema Swamiji speaks in person just as he does on the page -- with a loving, settled intent that bubbles out of the ....silence.... between (and behind) the words. ...nothing obstructs that clear expression. For me, that is the delight of reading this book, and of meeting him. The result so far? An energetic awakening in my heart that feels ....very ....good ! Read ""The Initiation"", and enjoy."
1,Do Not Buy This,This is the worst set I've ever owned. The handsfree set is not even usable - I can barely hear the person I'm talking to and everyone I called on it said they couldn't hear me. The charger is really slow or it's not charging the phone at all. The holder is very poorly made. Don't waste your money.
4,A Very Fast Printer,"This printer is awesome if you need a very fast printer, it is one of the fastest inkjets I've seen and is even faster than most personal lasers (if you count in the delay between when you send a document and when a laser printer actually prints). That said the ink cartridges cost almost twice as much as the ones for my Canon printer. I've had mine for two years and I recieved it used from a bussiness where it was networked, never had a problem at all!"
4,A novel way to Six Sigma,"""Six Sigma: Understanding the Concept, Implications and Challenges"", gently and in a novel way, takes the reader to understanding the importance of applied quality techniques in today's industry. Mario Perez-Wilson demonstrates how each ""opportunity of error"" in a complex manufacturing or administrative process can mount into disastrous cumulative consequences, if each opportunity is not reduced to zero. Armed with statistical methods, it is possible to achieve zero-defective products in processes involving mass productions in the order of the hundred thousand units, and this is what SIX SIGMA does. Like in the electronics industry, there are also many other processes in which it would be impossible to control the release of a flawless product or service if not counting with the power of a tool such as Six Sigma. This book clarifies concepts and introduces a new approach for those who must deal with quality issues, productivity, customer satisfaction, and profitability."
4,Good Job,"I've had this printer for a while, and it's great. It could be quieter on 1st sheet take up, but then it's pretty silent after that. Set up was a bit strange, but once sorted it's easy and the print quality is good to great in plain and photo,the scan function is very good and quick, it's ecomomical on the inks, and I'd recommend it."
2,kind of small,"is nice metallic finish, but not really as ""hard"" of a hardcase as depicted, more like molded softshell. not really room to fit spare battery without distorting the case. memory cards can fall easily out of the one little pocket that is included."
3,Decent Read,This was an okay read. The plot picked up in the 2nd half. I was a little disappointed in the caliber of the writing but still a good book to read at the beach.
1,Pass on this one,"This is basically a follow-up to ""Kiss of the Highlander"", which I loved. Sweet, funny, romantic and at times heartbreaking. Read that one, and then stop. This book is slow to start, and extremely convoluted, with no clear explanations as to the meaning of the other races/people described in the book. In addition, the author had the nerve to put in a shameless plug for one of her other books in the middle of this one. Is she that desperate? That came about 1/3 of the way into the book, and from that point on, I was so turned off that it was a real struggle to finish. What a disappointment...."
1,Not what I thought it would be...,"Unfortunately I can not agree with people on this page saying that this was a wonderful love story. Absolutely Not. Very dissapointing. Very poorly written. Author is trying so hard to make her Hero look and act sexy that it hurt my eyes to read about it!!! Her description of Him and Her is so annoying and irritaiting, I am still trying to finish the book, believe me it's hard! If you want a great story of love, romance, adventure and the life of True Highlanders (or Vikings) try ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon. I was very lucky to read that wonderful book before this tiring one and trust me - you will never again read Marie Moning..."
5,Good book,"So far, I've liked the Keltar books in this series more so than the rest. I think it's because of the romantic vows they exchange for eternity idea...Adam's is a close second, though.This book is more dark themed, though, than Drustan's story. Not horribly, but enough that it's noticeable- but I liked it none the less.Definitely a good read if you're into this series."
5,One Of My Favorite Books!!,i had read this book a couple of years ago and had lost it. i could not remember the author's name OR the title of the book!! all i could remember was the plot and i searched everywhere for it. i joined a book club online last year to exchange books with other readers and was looking for something to request when i read to summary for this book. i knew i had found what i had lost and i could not wait to get my hands on it again. it was even better the second time around and there is no way i will let it go this time! i plan on reading each book in the highlander series. ms moning is now on my list of favorite authors to read!
3,Didnt live up to its potential.....,"After reading the letter to Drustan and Gwen at the end of ""Kiss of the Highlander"", I absolutely could not wait to read ""The Dark Highlander""....Dageus and Chloe were lukewarm at best together...not that I didnt like them..I did..I just didnt think that their relationship was well developed enough..I struggled to finish this book...too much weird stuff happening and not enough romance...not a bad book, but not for me."
4,Another winner...,"This book was wondefull. Now, personally, Drustan's book was just a LITTLE bit better. DONT GET ME WRONG DAGEUS IS A HOTTIE TOO! But Im just overly fond of the bathroom scene..LOL!This book was great once the ball started to roll! Keep em coming KMM!!!"
5,The Dark Highlander is a truly great read!,"This book is filled with mystery, romance and adventure! All that a woman could want and more.... I definitely recommend this to anyone who believes in fate, soul-mates and true love."
3,Guilty pleasure,I enjoyed this book as much as I did the rest of the series. Ms. Moning does an excellent job of creating likable characters. I love series so it was fun to revisit previous characters and places. These books lead nicely into the Fever series which is my favorite.
5,Highlander at it's best....,"Without a doubt, n ot only one of my favorite in the series but one of my absolute favorite books ever. Loved it!!!"
2,What a Disappointment!!,"Could Ms. Moning have run out of fanciful ideas, lost her touch with hot scenes of passion, and created the most dithering and boring female character yet? Och, aye!This book could have been about 100 pages in length, since it basically starts 70 pages from the end. Too little magic and too much circling-and-sniffing. In a nutshell, the lead character, Dageus McKeltar, needed animal-level sex to keep his internal evil at bay. There's a concept! Remember Adam Black? He's not even part of the major story line...did I say story line. Yea, right.I have found Ms. Moning's other books at least entertaining, and some rather stimulating. One of her characters even made my Listmania List, Historical Hunks and Heroes. I am facinated with the concept of time-travel. Oh well, I guess this was just a filler to sell a few thousand more books, riding on the coattails of her past stories. I suppose I'll try her next one on for size, if only to hope she gets back on track."
4,Works As Intended,This charger works as intended. The retail stores were asking for as much as $120.00. When I saw this I bought it. My only issue is the length of the attached cords. The are about 30 to 40% shorter than my original.
5,Tammie,Product arrived in very timely fashion and was in exact condition described in advertisement. Works great and much cheaper than store bought would of been.
4,4-way splitter is not included,"The ""green thumb"" version of this product does not include the 4-way splitter valve which costs about 15 bucks by itself. I found this system at Home Depot with the 4-way splitter for less money than this one, and that's before shipping of 6 bucks is added. So far I've been happy with all of the Orbit brand timers I've bought, just realize that this version lacks the 4-way splitter."
3,You get what you pay for,"Item Commentary:1) Leather carrying case: Pretty good quality leather. This was not a big selling point with me since I already had the belt clip that was included with the phone. Still it's nice to have something to somewhat shield the phone from the elements.2) Earbud: Ok quality. Basically functional. Not as good as a headset like the ones Jabra makes but I wasn't expecting it to be either.3) Car charger: Works ok but... case is made of cheap plastic. Plus it's not held together well. Casing is starting to split because the power outlet is near a vanity compartment which when open leans on the charger while it is plugged in.Would I buy this type of equipment again from this manufacturer? Probably, if I wanted to save money. I might also hunt around for a higher quality product (probably from the phone manufacturer) for a slightly higher price though."
3,Great Until Video Head Malfunctioned,"As warned, there is some fuzzy quality in bad lighting conditions and the colors are extra vibrant, but overall this was an excellent video camera, especially for the low price of $280 (not sure why it seems to be much more on Amazon.com now). However, at just after a year, the video camera's head malfunctioned, showing clear or grey horizontal lines across the screen. After doing everything the Sony technician recommended, including cleaning the head with a head cleaner cassette, the head still gives me problems, especially at the start of taping (the captured video is completely ruined). The cost of fixing it was close to the cost of getting another camera so I will have to find another video camera altogether."
1,Same problem as others-transfer to PC is TERRIBLE and expensive,"As others have stated, transfer to pC is virtually impossible and tech support is useless. Shame on Sony for such a poor product."
1,Don't buy this if you want to create files for PC,"The software used to transfer files to the PC is garbage, and this is the second time i've been disapointed with terrible sony software. If I can't get this resolved, I'm returning the camera. In this era, consumers should be able to easily transer files, I can't get the audio to playback, after being bounced around by tech support @ Sony, I do not recoment if you intend to save vidoe to PC"
1,DO NOT BUY,LCD screen will not respond. Sony will charge aprox. $200.00 to repair. It's not a bad camera but only lasted a few months past the warrenty. Also is difficult to transfer tapes to disc. Not compatable with most PC's. If you only need the camera for a year or so this one is fine. If you want one that will last don't purchase!!
4,Sony Camcorder,"This sony camera is a nice, but exspensive, camera. It has an easy touch pad, along with an 800x digital zoom. This camera also has a quick battery charger that can charge the battery much faster that an anolog camera. This camera also has its down side, if you are doing a video with quick moving objects, maybe do't get this, because I do lightsaber battles and when I have them move fast, I see a faded shadow type thing following it. But the object has to go FAST! Please get this camera along with the Sony DV Mini Tapes, they make a good couple!"
2,Tried to be everything to everyone,"FileMaker 6 is a good book, however it tries to encompass all aspects of FileMaker development. A great concept, but not enough actual ""useful"" material dedicated to each topic to be applicable.It seems as if the author is trying to rest on the Laurels of others as there are numerous developers that actually penned many of the chapters. The book is a little too self promotional for me.Just about every chapter listed has been thoroughly discussed in other books, and I find this book is no exception."
5,If you can only afford one FM book - make it this one,"I have been developing in Filemaker since version 3, but do so in isolation from other developers. So books are important to keep up to date and benefit from other's experience. I have a library of 10 or more Filemaker books, some specialising in particular areas, like web delivery. But if you only have time, space, or money for one general-purpose Filemaker book, then there is no question it should be this one.I never have time to read a 'Lesson 1' style book - I am more likely to read a single chapter of interest, or use it as a reference. This book suits that role well. It will give you good knowledge of basic-intermediate development skills, and gives strong treatment to some more difficult subjects, like plug-ins and interfacing to other programs. If you are planning to work on web-delivery, this will get you started, but you should also get Advanced Filemaker Pro 6 Web Development (Bowers/Lane)"
2,"pretty, but doesn't work very well","I want to like this doll, but am disappointed in the spinning/ light up feature. You never know if it's going to work or not. Sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't. If I didn't get it so cheap, I would have returned it by now."
3,Princes Genevieve is a big hit,"I bought this Barbie doll for my 4 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Even little girls love Barbie, but as with all Barbie dolls, she is difficult to dress and undress. As long as help is provided when needed, my granddaughter will play with her for a long time. As with all Barbie dolls, the doll is well made, but the clothes are cheaply made. Therefore I never rate them over a 3."
4,Another Barbie,We have the movie and just had to have the Barbie. Her skirt spins and lights up but all in all she's just another Barbie. The hair is crazy after one day of playing and soon she will be in the box with all the others and the next Barbie to come out will be on the wish list.
2,Cheap for a Reason,"I went with these particular DVDs because they were the most cost effective. However, in addition to low cost they are poor quality. I've used 12 discs so far and half of them were unusable. Next time I'll pay the extra few bucks for a better brand."
4,couldn't find in the store,"i used to be able to find these in stores around town and suddenly they just went MIA. i was happy to find these online-but they seemed a bit smaller around. they didn't fit snugly into the woodpecker feeder so the squirrels took them, but that's ok they need to eat also."
1,Quiet Time is a Waste of Time,I'm not sure why this book was recommended for me. I found it one of the poorest written books that I have ever read. It was also very outdated. I'm not even sure why I finished this book.
4,QUIET TIME,"SOME BOOKS LET YOU DOWN. QUIET TIME KEYS YOU UP. THE SEARCH CONTINUES IN YOUR MIND UNTIL SARI FINALLY FACES THE TRUTH. SOME FAMILY SECRETS ARE HARD TO TELL. ONLY IF YOU READ ""QUIET TIME"" DO YOU KNOW JUST HOW HARD THEY REALLY ARE."
4,decent,"I got these to replace the worn out factory gas charged shocks on my 2005 Ram 1500 2wd. I knew they would be a bit ""squishy"" as they are not gas charged and its great on the truck for when i need to get on dirt roads or if i do some 2wd safe trails. A bit weird on the street at times but nothing i'm not used to having driven with non gas charged shocks before.If your main use is street, grab the bilistiens or RS9000's, for a cheaper, decent trail first street second shock these are decent."
4,Really good blades.,"Good blades, good price. Based on usage of my factory blades and how beat up they got, how quickly they dulled, etc... I bought a few sets of these blades right off. Well, I mowed a whole season and never had to open the other 2 sets. These are tough, hold a good edge, and cut well. I would by again (if I didnt already have 2 more sets )"
2,A Cookie Cutter Book,"Sometimes an analogy is the best way to describe something. Let's say you wanted a book about the Twinkie. You found a book about them. It has fuzzy black and white pictures of Twinkies that have never been shown before to your knowledge. It has a picture of the untranslated side to a box of Twinkies from a distant country. It has a brief write-up about Twinkies, getting some facts and definitions inaccurate, without any attempt of analysis, comparison, or even simple prioritization. Would that be a good book about Twinkies for those of you who want to learn more about this yummy snack? Probably not."
2,Disappointment,"I thought I was ordering the book ""To Kill Mockingbird"" and was disappointed to receive a book on commentary not the book."
1,MISREPRESENTATION - NOT APC Product as clearly stated and pictured - Buyer Beware!,Purchased 3 of these units. They were NOT APC Genuine parts. The picture and the item description are both misleading and untrue.
1,1.0 Audio on a Blu-ray? Come on.,"Such a great, GREAT film (I'm referring to the original Arthur, not Arthur 2, PLEASE no Arthur 2!), but the Blu-ray leaves a LOT to be desired.Since when do RECENT Blu-ray releases of a MULTIPLE OSCAR WINNING FILM get released with 1.0 (yes, you read that right) audio on the Blu-ray? How is this acceptable??Truly a shame for such a great film. It deserved a better release, and has for years now."
2,Superficial and biased,"I don't know anything at all about this author, but the book feels as if it were written by a 16 year old fan. The writing itself is very basic, and you get the feeling he thinks EVERYTHING the band did was awesome.....ie: and then they trashed the hotel room (how cool!), they smashed their instruments (it was cool!) etc etc. The heavy drug use is written as almost trivial, and the Courtney/Kurt relationship portrayed as 'cute' (at least it read that way to me). Poor Dave Grohl is written as almost inconsequential.Kurt was/is my age, I knew many guys like him, looking down on the popular/'in' groups - rejecting them before they could reject him. This isn't punk, it's insecurity. Was he talented? yes, and I am/was a fan - but Nirvana's music is not holding up to time as much as some of the other 90's 'grunge' bands. Kurt's life was sad and it's a shame his obvious cries for help were ignored."
4,Excellent story discussing the life of Kurt and Nirvana,I enjoyed reading this book. Every Nirvana fan should get his/her hands on this book!
2,To Much Fluff,I grew up in the Seattle area and have been a Nirvana fan since first hearing them back in 1990. I thought the book had a lot of exaggerations in it to paint Kurt Cobain as being a punk rocker since his birth in 1967. It was also very 'Courtney friendly'. The author was obviously a huge Nirvana fan and I think the book was written from that perspective rather than from an objective one. Biographies are usually better coming from an unbiased biographer.
2,nah...,"i'm a huge nirvana/cobain fan, and i think i've read every book out there writen on them/him. this was one of the most boring and inaccurate ones, by far. it especially paints a dull and wimpy picture of dave grohl who's anything but. it also depicts a false, i.e., flattering, picture of courtney that's quite annoying. i was bored to tears reading this book. it leaves a lot to be desired. although ""heavier than heaven"" also contains a lot of courtney schmoozing and inaccurate info, it makes a far better and more entertaining read. you're better off getting that instead of this one."
4,The definitive Nirvana book,As the owner of every book written on this subject Come As You Are stands out as the definitive Nirvana book. With the exception of the final chapter the entire thing was written before Kurt's death. This gives fans an honest objective view on Kurt and Nirvana that is absent in just about everything written since his suicide. The marketplace has been flooded with books focusing on sleaze and conspiracy theories instead of the man and their music. Here the writer stayed on course and gave us what truly matters while managing to keep this entertaining. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about Kurt's life and his rise from troubled child to reluctant rock star.
5,Insightful,"I saw a clip of Kurt Cobain where he mentioned this book in an interview after it had been published and he said something along the lines of he had read the first 2 chapters of the book and realized he needed to learn to keep his mouth shut. He really does open up and give a very intimate view of his life, especially his childhood and relationship with his family in this book. I know much of the story is edited and there is always a slant given by the author, but I felt the book was very insightful and answered many questions I had about Kurt, his music, and his struggles. I have not read the other biographies yet so I cannot compare them, but if you would like to hear about Nirvana and Kurt through Kurt's voice, I recommend this book. Its really a privelege to hear him talk so candidly. When I got near the end I didn't want to finish it because I didn't want him to stop talking."
5,An Awesome Book,"This book was one of the greatest book I have ever read. It gave in great detail about the band, and individual members. It also has Kurt telling what his songs are about. If you are a Nirvana I suggest you read this book(even though it is long it is fast reading). In addition to all the things I said, it also has things like where the members came from, about Kurt's parents, past band members, and concerts. You are going to learn something new after reading this book."
3,A good scholarly work. Recommended.,"Examining the problem of the unity of the Old and New Testaments from the perspective of the texts themselves, David Baker analyzes four modern solutions, discusses some key themes, and then offers his own solutions. Overall this is a good book, worth reading, and very helpful to those ""wrestling"" with the relationships between the two ""covenant documements.""We give it our 3-Diamond Rating @ The Discerning Reader. It is recommended."
1,Re-issue cartoons from other DVDs.,"Instead of buying this mix & match batch of cartoons (only the first 9 are Superman), I would steer you to the Image Entertainment DVD collection of restored Superman Cartoons from 35mm! As for the Bosko cartoons included here, you can get a better collection from Bosko Video's Complete Uncensored Bosko Collection volumes 1 & 2."
5,Great product and service,"This workbook arrived on time in great condition. Everyone could find this useful, even those with a healthy level of self-esteem. It is well written and easily understood even for teenagers. I highly recommend this product."
2,sel-esteem book book,"It seemed to take too long to get to the point and the point was so obvious. This book seemed directed toward pre-teen or teen level...not an educated adult. There was ""workbook"" type task but not enough at the correct stages..."
5,Great book,As an academician this book is easy to read but practitioners will have no diffculty in understanding the content of this book. I rate this book as a great book because of its practicality and yet it is theoretically sound.
4,the killer inside me keech,good but not great the flick arrived on time and in good shape. i paid way too much but it was hard to find and i wanted to see it. i used to like anything by jim thompson but have moved on
3,also check out....,"hello, just a hint: if you like this album, also check out Hometime by Alison Moyet . She made an exquisit popalbum with a trippy edge to it. She colabborated with the men behind Massive Attack and Goldfrapp (also a must have by the way :-)"
1,"If there was a zero, I'd pick it!!!","I absolutely love hiphop! I've been listening to it all my life. In my lifetime, I've purchased hundreds of albums. This album, by far, is the absolute worst ""hip hop"" album, if you dare to call it that, that I have ever heard!!! I've owned it for about two, or three months now, and barely listened to it less than 2 times. In fact, as soon as I finish writing this, I'm going to crack the cd in two, and throw it in the garbage! It's actually in my pocket right now ready to go! I hated it! It was seriously painful to listen to it more than one time. I absolutely hated it!!! Do NOT buy this album, you'll be happy you did'nt. It includes the absolute weakest rhymes, and beats EVER!!!!! Whomever it was that wrote this album, seriously needs to get a life, far apart from hip hop that is! Give me a break, Dungeons and Dragons!!! God! It makes me want to run full speed into a brick wall!!!"
2,This is far from being a complete collection !,"Any serious fan or even casual observor of INXS through the years knows that two tracks in paticular were defining moments -- ""Don't Change"" and ""Not Enough Time"" -- which would have been fitting bookends here but are strangely absent. Where the hell are those two songs ?!?! Not to mention another song ""Taste It"" off the woefully represented ""Welcome To Wherever You Are"" is missing as well. A few of the songs included like ""Heaven Sent"" and ""The Stairs"" are disposable tracks at best and add nothing to the sum of it's parts. The hitlist represented here is fair but whoever assembled this collection must have been blindfolded with a dartboard of singles in front of them. Either that, or an Atlantic Records intern suffered a head injury."
4,"But where is ""Don't Change?""","and ""To Look at You"" belongs as well. Get Shabooh Shoobah along with this one and THEN you'll have their Greatest Hits."
1,Corporate Finance lack luster,"This book was last updated in 1988. The material is not current and the examples are not clear. It would help to have the formulas in the back of the book on the questions they have provided answers too.When buying a book for this price, I would expect a more detail."
1,A shallow read,"The Highlander series is a pretty shallow read. There isn't much meat to the story lines in any of the Highlander books, and they all follow an identical formula."
2,Too much like the last book,"I own all of K. Moning's books and this story almost parelled the last book she wrote. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the characters and the dialogue. But the story line is almost completly lifted from the last one. After reading this, I was very surprised by Ms. Moning comment that this was the hardest book she has ever written. I think for the future I will check out the library copy of any future books she might write."
1,Oh please!,"As someone who reads constantly, I go through phases. Currently being into romantic/erotica, and a HUGE fan of Diana Gabaldon, I took a chance on this book. The ratings were good, story line sounded promising. However, take my advice; don't buy this book!! Rarely do I give up on a book after 4 chapters, but it was so poorly written with dull, predictable characters I had no choice. If you like this, cheaper Harlequin romances should do just as well."
2,"Annoying, boring.","I've read all of the Highlander Series up to this book and loved them all. I am still reading this one and will surely update my review when I finish, but I am so frustrated that I have to start the review now.I'm over 1/4 of the way through the book and all I'm getting is pure annoyance, especially with the main male character (Adam). I know the heroine is supposed to be annoyed by Adam, but surely we can MOVE ON ALREADY!?!? I don't care how hot he looks, Karen is making him out to be the most irritating character. Nothing sexy about this one.Agh! I want to give up on this book! So stupid!"
2,Just ok...,"Not my favorite book of the series, but still a good story. The story of the feisty Gabrielle and Adam Black does introduce the Unseelie Hunters and Darroc into the storyline. Characters from the Fever series, which now I refer back to and remember that the MacKeltar clan played an important part in the storyline as well.I didn't realize these two series were intertwined, which makes me think I should reread the Fever series with the background gained in the Highlander series. Intriguing."
5,THE INMORTAL HIGHLANDER,"THIS IS A GOOD ONE. THIS KEEP ME READING THE WHOLE NIGHT.EVEN THE HERO IS FABULOS , HIS LADY STRONG AND NOT THE SAME TYPE LIKE ALLWAYS .SHE WAS WORKING LIKE REAL AMERICAN NO BABY CRYING."
3,"Good, but not her best....","To keep this short and simple, I just want to say that I wish this book would have focused on the ""real"" Adam Black. He was absolutely nothing like the Adam Black that we'd seen bits and pieces of in the previous books. What happened to the pompous, under-handed bastard that I loved so much?The story was pretty good overall, but I just didn't feel the true Adam come through in this book."
4,Great until the end,This book was wonderful. If she had added a little more sex and the ending was a little less rushed it would have been perfect.
5,Another Great Highlander Series book!!,"This is another Karen Moning book that features the MacKeltars. All I can say is...READ THIS BOOK! It is a great mixture of magic, highlands, passion & humor. The characters are well developed and get you itching to read the rest of the MacKeltar books (#1 ""Kiss of the Highlander"" - (Drustans story),#2 ""Dark Highlander"" (drustans twin), #3 ""Immortal Highlander"" (Adam Black - side character interacting w/ MacKeltars), #4 ""Spell of the Highlander"" (part of MacKeltar clan), #5 ""Highlander's Touch"" (seperate story linked w/ Adam Black), #6 ""Into the Dreaming"" - a novella that features the fairy queen mentioned in the other books. NOTE: This is my suggestion for the order to read them in. There is not real official order in which to read them. All I know is once you finish this book, you will be itching to read the rest. ENJOY!!!"
5,Loved it!,"Karen Marie Moning's books just keep getting better. I really enjoyed this one. Adam Black wasn't a terribly sympathetic character before this, but he makes a great hero here."
4,Hard-working leaders of traditional metal/thrash!,"I will have to agree with the previous review. However, the first track ""Dig Me Up To Bury Me"" is extremely fast. New drummer Craig Nelson, replacing a tired Kelly David Smith was a step forward in the right direction. Perhaps Metallica should consider replacing Lars. His drumming technique has reached new standards of being ""tired"". Ed Carlson is ripping leads again as opposed to the last several albums and A.K is singing with more passion than ever before.Most impressive of all, is their ability to remain creative in a stylistic and studio engineering point of view. See tracks like ""Trash"" and ""My God"". While sticking to their original roots, they were able on this album to keep from sounding repetitous and contrived.I'm not sure if the other guy from San Francisco even bothered to listen to the album. He doesn't seem to make a great deal of sense."
5,FINALLY!!!,"I've often wondered if Gigli can be on DVD, why can't Hot Stuff? I have searched high & low for any news of its release and just happened to check Amazon and there it was! I'm so happy that this little gem of a comedy has made it to DVD. I used to watch this movie non-stop when HBO aired it all the time during the 80's. The cast was wonderful...from Dom Deluise to Suzanne Pleshette to Jerry Reed to Ozzie Davis and everybody in between. From the opening credits to the laugh-out loud finale, Hot Stuff is a must-see movie on a rainy day. I can't wait to order my copy!"
5,Full of great insights and practical messages,"Flashpoint does a great job providing real world examples of people just like me and how I can take concrete actions in my life to master the art of economic abundance. Believe me, after reading this book I am ready to create my first economic Monet!"
5,Blue Computer Tower Case,"I really like this computer case a lot! It is on my computer right now and it is beautiful! It has these real pretty glowing blue lights on the front of it. It measures your VU, Temp, and Fan Speed on your computer. It keeps your computer safe and dust free. I don't even have to dust my computer on the inside any more now that I have this case. It also has a nice door on the front that opens up and inside is all your disk drives and power buttons and stuff. My son put this together for me and it is great. I also recommend a large Gateway LCD monitor to go with it. Thats what I have and it makes a great upgrade. Also this case has a clear left side which is cool because there are some more glowing blue lights inside and you can peek in there to see what your computer looks like in case you forget! If you like blue, then this is the case for you!"
4,Garmin Topo U.S. 2008,We are relative newbies to GPS. We purchase a Garmin Nuvi 650 for the numerous road trips we go on 4 wheel drive adventures at and on the way to the destinations. This product fills in the blank screen when we off road with useful information that we previously lacked. For the money it is a great product that we welcome into our Jeeping experience.
4,Missing Unlocking Code..,"Got the product pretty fast. Was unable to find the code to use to unlock the maps. Also found that some streets are missing, around my places of interest."
3,Garmin MapSource TOPO 2008 DVD,I have a Garmin Vista C. Software is very easy to use. Thought the software would of had more details. Not much different from my older version :(
3,Garmin Topo U.S.,"I have used this product and have some mixed feelings. I also have National Geo Topo and like it very well. Garmin works and it does transfer to my hand help GPS. That is what I bought it for. The National Geographic Topo wont do this. The product would stand to imporve by adding more of the existing ""Ghost Towns"" and old mines like the Chumung Mine near Masonic. I was able to navigate to the Chumung Mine and it seemed to work with my Garmin Summint GPS. For example, it seems to take extra time to calculate milage or distance to a route. Hopefully, this is not due to my lack of experience with the software. I do wish it had more of the feel of the topo's I have worked with in the past."
2,Garmin 2008 software,"I was concerned about the 2008 Garmin edition of MapSource Topo. I have the previous edition. Apparently they have not updated the map detail in keeping with the regular updates done by the USGS. I called National Geographic about their Topo!GPS maps USA that are on a state by state basis but are 1:24,000 and are very detailed. You cannot transfer these maps to any Garmin unit as Garmin is very proprietary. You can transfer waypoints and POI's but not the maps. However National Geographic told me they have just completed arrangements with Magellan that will allow transfer of their 7.5 maps to the new Triton GPS that will become availabe in the near future. So their is still hope for better mapping but this will require purchase of a Magellan unit.LJB"
4,Great TOPO,"MapSource installed easy on my Windows 7 machine, no problems with combatibillity. I like being able to maintaine several of my Garmins with one software package and no goofy software keys, serial numbers or other types of limiitations of the software.Installation is straight forward and even if you are computer challenged, this is doable.The bummer for the whole thing would be if you want to add just one area on your GPS, it will erase everything else, so when adding areas to your GPS you will have to re-add previous areas back on."
5,New and Improved,Topo 2008 is much improved over the previous version. It installs nicely on your HD and doesnt't require the cd. Map resolutions are better and the net price after rebates is about $30.
1,Wait! Don't buy yet!,"I purchased the Topo US 2008 to go with my new eTrex Summit HC. The Garmin topo maps in this product are 1:100,000 scale. I now realize that I need 1:24,000/25,000 scale which is the same as the USGS maps that I normally use. I would wait until they come out with the smaller scale. I am very disappointed. Once you have looked at an area in 1:24,000 scale, the 1:100,000 looks pretty useless."
2,Lacks sufficient detail for hiking/backpacking,"In theory, you can use this product to download waypoints, an entire route, or even a topographic map to your Garmin mapping GPS. However, the maps are so lacking in detail that they are nearly useless for hiking or backpacking. For one thing, vertical contours are 150 feet each, compared with 40 feet for typical topographic maps. Contour lines, roads, and trails all look pretty similar to one another, and are really hard to view.The interface is really easy to use -- it took almost no time to figure out how to import and export maps and waypoints. However, the program has a very definite Windows 95 look with really simple graphics and colors.It's amazing that Garmin has created a line of terrific mapping GPS units, but then left out the maps. The bottom line is that there are currently no good options for getting detailed topo maps onto your garmin mapping GPS."
2,Meets Mimnimum- But No 3-D Relief,"I am disappointed in the topo features of this topo product! There is no relief at zoomed out resolution and the relief when zoomed in is not blended- i.e. there is no 3-d effect at any resolution.Like other MapSource products, it works well on the handheld but navigation is klutzy on the PC.I get better zoomed out terrain indication on my other mapping products,even those that don't advertise it, such as MS Streets & Trips. This was a wasted expense, but I got what I paid for. I should have purchased Topo USA but didn't want to pay the greater price. Poorer but wiser, I will now do that."
3,Reviews do not match digital book,"There are no illustrations in this digital book only bookmarks where an illustration should have been. Also the publisher, Library of Alexandria, states in the description that there is an interactive table of contents and this is not true. I was disappointed in this purchase. Gave it 3 stars for the stories though I have not read them yet."
2,Not real Barbies!,"We get all of the dolls for the movies and everything else for that matter and never have a complaint. These dolls are not like real barbies and cannot be played with as such. Their sole purpose is to stand in the stand and twirl. The legs broke on both dolls within a week and I, the ultimate barbie fixer could not do a thing but throw them away. The legs are together by elastic and a clip and if one goes than thats it. Was able to salvage the clothes. If you have someone that likes to actually play with her dolls than this is not for you."
4,Got to clip the doll on correctly,"My 5 year old received this as a Christmas gift and was quite pleased. We have had no problems with the girls staying on their stands as others have reviewed. The trick is that the girls' straight leg clips onto the side of the stand in the holder and she has to straddle over the top of it also. It did take a minute for us to figure that out as it was not clearly addressed in the directions. The girls make lovely poses for dancing. Overall, my daugter really enjoys this toy and how the dancers twirl. We have not had a problem with the quality of this toy."
5,"Greatest product, fast secure shipping, best price available!","In my opinion this is the best dog food on the market for all breeds. Our 7 year old miniature poodle ""mix"" had problems with seizures. The vet recommended ""medication"" to control the seizures which was expensive.A friend recommended trying Natural Balance dog food. I am happy to report that our ""Scooter"" has been seizure free now for over three years.We now have both of our dogs dining on this mix and they are both very healthy. Our other pooch is a 13 year old Bi-shon, we wouldn't feed them anything else.Thanks to my purchases of this product on Amazon.com, I save the fuel I would normally use going to several pet stores to find this product, also Amazon delivers it right to my door for the same price I would pay for it in the local store.I wouldn't buy it from any other source.You should consider buying this product and I would highly recommend this particular blend.Mike CrabbsBelAir, Maryland"
5,Here there be dragons!,"I bought this book for a friend's daughter for Christmas, and I hate to part with it! It is magical, gorgeous and stunning, from its rich, bejeweled cover to its many treasures within: beautiful illustrations, witty text, fun pull-outs, even samples of shed dragon skin, wing membranes and dragon dust (all lovely!) We learn much about dragons, from their life cycles and behaviors to their flying techniques (""A happy dragon is a dragon that loops"") and how they're REALLY able to breathe fire (Ah, I'd always wondered....) And at the end, a wise message about caring for the world and its creatures lest they vanish....and another charming surprise that I won't give away. No serious dragonologist should be without this enchanting book! :-)"
5,It's not just for kids!!!,"I bought this book for my adult sister who has a bit of an affinity for dragons, thinking it would be a ""cute"" little gift. When the book arrived, I was so impressed with the cover alone! It's a deep red, with red foil lined dragons and four ""emeralds,"" alluding to the notion that dragons are attracted to gems. I couldn't help but read it myself...and I must say it will be hard to relinquish it to my sister! It's full of illustrations, as well as ""samples"" of dragon scales and dragon dust. It references some of our greats, such as Merlin, Marco Polo and Magnus...just to name a few. Yes, it's fiction. Yes, it's an easy read. Yet any adult who appreciates our old world legends will have a blast with this book!"
5,Lovable,The person I gave it to as a birthday gift loved it!She was excited. She said it has fascinating information about dragons and she liked the author.
3,nice colors,"I like the colors, fabrics, and patterns, but the quilt started to fray after the first wash."
2,Poor Construction,This cheese slicer is not a quality product. The slicing arm is loose and the wire does not stay in the the grove on the marble slab. I would not recommend it and don't use it.
3,Marble slicer,"I ordered and received 2 slicers both in the green marble. The wire slicer on one of them was broken upon receipt. Thanks to the extra 2 wires taped to the bottom, I was able to replace it. Was not looking forward to making a return. Have used both slicers since then and they are great. Usual tip: inspect all product carefully when you receive it."
5,great chhese slicer,"This is a great cheese slicer. I looked at many that were alot more in cost, and this one is better than the more expensive ones. Great buy"
4,Cocker's most inspirational performance,"If you can't afford the full boxed set, this is a nice sampler of the WOODSTOCK experience. Joe Cocker soars on ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" and after 1001 listens I still get chills. It's an amazing performance. On a technical level this CD is sloppy at times, but the overall effect is wonderful and makes one yearn for more. Pop music has become so lame and such a forum for people who have no talent outside of studio and the effects that can be produced with electronics that it makes one yearn for a time when true talent and musicianship were all that was necessary for an intense musical experience. This disc will give you a taste of what can be called the height of an era when real emotions and raw talent ruled the airwaves and the public's taste for music."
5,a solid soundtrack for an awesome documentary,"Granted this is not the original soundtrack in some regards, this album offers for me the best of Woodstock. Seeing as though I wasnt around in 1969 (I wasnt born until 1977), first seeing the Wadleigh film got me interested not only in 60s rock but also the whole odd (yet captivating) social experiment that was hippie counterculture. This soundtrack (as well as the film) helped form my rock music tastes for now and forever. Santana's Soul Sacrifice, the Who and Hendrix at the end are songs that I definitely use the Repeat button for!"
3,Dissapointed,"I am dissapointed with this CD, track 1 hangs and can't get out without rebooting the PC. I a CD player it hangs for a while then continues. Would return it, but mailing costs are too high.Hope I have better luck next time.Thanks,.....Graham"
5,"He'sTaken Many Beatings for This Knowlege, Be Smart Read It","If you have never read a book or seen a video from Marc ""Animal"" MacYoung, you are in for a very different experience. MacYoung relies on many of his own street experiences to pass along information and techniques. This results in some wild tales and the liberal use of ""street"" language throughout the book. (Sometimes I wonder if Paladin puts their authors up to this). You'd probably not want your mother to read this, but for the reader who needs to get streetwise fast, take advantage of MacYoung's experience and skip the beatings of your own.Brad Parker, Defend University"
3,"Nice display, but the Range is Questionable.","Nice display, but the range is questionable. Modem had to be moved to a closer location in order for this wireless adapter to have decent connectivity."
3,ocatve,its like so so...basically i bought it for having projector.but its ledger power is not so strong.
2,Sturdy EZ Frame Bracket,For the price this is a great buy I did discover that Home Depot and your local Lowes does not carry this product. For extra support order 2 for each side. The top section that mounts to the 4x6 beam could be a little longer with more attachment options for more support. I am not using this on a stand alone swing set. One side is mounted to a pre existing play set... There are more expensive brackets on the market but this little guy does the job.
1,Fying Corps Gold:Don't By Used Games!!!!!!,"I was supplied with a stickered disc,advising that it was a pre-used disc.The disc ran badly wobbled and vibrated badly and would not read. I tried to remove the sticker,but it was a great glue. I ended up screwing up the surface of the disc,trying. My mistake. i should have returned it.Be advised,that if any disc has an unbalanced label on it.Return,Return,return>>>"
1,Nonsense,This is more of the anti-science religious nonsense of young-earth creationists. It's too bad that some people believe that thei faith requires that they be ignorant.
1,Hilariously bad!,"How anyone with reasonable intelligence can take a book like this seriously is beyond me. This work is riddled with basic errors; it is shameful to call any book this inaccurate educational.Christian [...], propagating ignorance.Science is asking questions, religion is blindly accepting superstition. Scientific questions lead to more questions, lead to query after query. Viewpoints and opinion evolve as further discoveries open exciting new avenues of thought.<P[....]This book is extremely useful for any parent wishing to highlight the foolishness of fundamentalist belief."
1,Wow! This is scary stuff.,"Yes, it's scary that people still actually believe in the bible but also in ludicrous fantasies like this. It's like somehow your were to take a time machine back to the 17th century.It's not only scary, but very sad that such ingnorance abounds in the world. Do to the nature of human gullibility, there will always be the dupes of religion. There is nothing that can can be done to counter ignorance when confronted with people who remonstrate against reason and facts.The best that can be done with these people is ignore them the best you can and let them live out their pitiful fantasies. You may wonder what they make of tree rings or where they think all the different kinds of dogs came from.I wouldn't be surprised to find they still believe the sun revolves around the earth and in spontaneous combustion. And I'm sure many still believe in phlogiston and the ether. So, just pity them and send them on their way."
4,Awesome,"This is a great CD. Everyone who likes any kind of rock at all should buy it, even if only for ""Interstate Love Song"" which is one of my all time favorite 90's love songs (second only to ""Song for You"" by Fuel)"
2,vastly over-rated,"This album sounds pretty good the first few times you listen to it but it grows old fast. It just seems to be style over substance, Vaseline and Big Empty are the only tracks that have much lasting appeal. For me, STP were the most over-rated grunge band back in the early 90s. Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Smashing Pumpkins (not really grunge but around at the same time) are all far more enjoyable.I do like Velvet Revolver though. So if you like Velvet Revolver dont assume you'll like this STP album."
2,"I am purple,allright!","Only two songs stand out.I was very,very disapointed with this album.Save your money!"
5,As close to a classic as this decade produced!,"In my opinion, ""Purple"" is without question one of the top ten albums of the 90's. Three songs from it: ""Vasoline"", ""Interstate Love Song"", and ""Big Empty"" have become modern day classics. But this album contains many other great songs including ""Meatplow"", ""Unglued"", and especially ""Army Ants."" It is not quite as heavy as ""Core"" and not quite as diverse as ""Tiny Music"" but it provides a nice medium. The band's creativity and writing skills are really on display here. If you like STP, you probably already have it. But if not, pick it up."
5,True grunge,"Purple was the first time I had heard of Stone Temple Pilots, and then I listened to the rest, becoming an instant fan. What this album does is abandon the Core sound and really gets into that grunge mode, but they do it gracefully, and looking back, everyone knows they succeeded. This did not intend to compare with what Nirvana was doing, producing some good catchy tunes like Meatplow, Vasoline, Big Empty, and of course, Interstate Love Song. It belongs in every music fan's CD collection. Nuff said."
5,It is one of the best rock CDs of all-time,"The album purple rocks the whole way through with grinding ballads like ""Vaseline"" and one of the best songs written. (Interstate love song). This album which debuted at #1 in 1994 goes beyond the boundries of grunge with its 12 gracious melodies. The foursome stands above the rest with this masterpiece."
4,Very Good,"Well, i'd say that this album is very good, but i have to be in the perfect mood to listen to it. I really like all the songs, but i wish there were some more upbeat songs that make me really feel content. To all those people here that hate grunge: it may not be for you, but other pple like it. Everyone has different music opinions."
1,Poor design,After using this product twice I was extremly disapointed.The drip tray does not catch all the dripping from frying bacon.The grease ends up all over the counter and melting the base unit that the drip tray fits in. You would think Wolfgang Puck would try this product under all conditions to make sure it is enginered corectly. My counters are level so this is not an issue. I am a dissatisfied customer.
1,wolfgang puck griddle is a piece of garbage,"Purchased is March 2010 and with in 2 months the item sparked, caught on fire and burnt out. Shop it was purchased from was no help with warrentee and neither was this web page (i would put the name but they make bad reviews as spam so people do not see them. good luck if you have a problem"
2,Really stupid video,Lily Tomlin is not at her best in this one. I found it rather disappointing. Don't waste your time watching it.
3,A glimpse into the former Electric Youth's heyday.,"This is a good introduction to Deborah Gibson's music, and it contains her most famous songs _Lost In Your Eyes_, _Foolish Beat_, _Only In My Dreams_, and _Electric Youth_. But this collection does not do Gibson justice, because the current Deborah Gibson has matured into a comfortable and self-knowing performer and artist. Check out her latest album, _Deborah_ and see how far she's come. You don't stick around in a cruel and cynical industry without talent and brains. Deborah Gibson...she's come a long way, baby!"
4,Sweet Memories,"Debbie Gibson's spectacular string of hits for Atlantic mostly are here but how can ""This So-Called Miracle"" be missing and a few other standouts? Why didn't Atlantic do a genuine greatest hits collection instead of repeating tracks with dance versions? And why not place the tracks in chronological order? Maybe one day Atlantic will redo this package. In the meantime, yes, it's nice to have even if it's not what it should have been. As for Miss Deborah and her music, it all speaks for itself. She's a great composer and lyricist who worked far beyond her age. Her later albums, post-hit period, represented her greatest work but went sadly unheard. My bet is she will be back one day but the time just isn't quite right yet. She still has a big Broadway career ahead of her and eventually a Tony. Just wait and see."
1,Failure in all points.,"Many mistakes (even big ones) like picture has nothing to do with it's title and/or index. Not a word about car specifications (horse power, tire pressure ...). But hundreds of stupid advice's, like ""don't touch engine while it's hot"" etc."
4,MIKE's Florida review,"I am planning a trip to a cold place and decided I would need boots to use while up north and they would also need to incorporate a steel toe. Since I would use them only occasionally I bought an inexpensive pair from Walmart but they were just that and had to return them. I found these and tried them on and they feel great, look good and go on easily. The true test will be in a few weeks but so far so good. Maybe they'll be a 5 star rating then."
5,Indestructable,"This thing is extremely strong, I have thrown it 20 feet and it didn't even come close to breaking. Great for somebody who treats their water bottles poorly, or those who are thirsty."
3,"well done & worthwhile, worth reading","I enjoyed it; I found her style totally compatible with my taste. The story moved very well, settings & characterizations quite well-drawn. I think there may have been more time & place-specific allusions than would serve well for other than an airport book (it's NOT an airport book but might be mistaken for one), but I suspect that at least some of them work without cultural familiarity with the reference (an example, as the protagonist is driving out of town on a particularly grim day in a grim mood, leaves the chapter with the line ""All the leaves were brown and the sky was gray"" - well that works just fine even if you aren't hip to the John Phillips song.A fun book, but more than just fun, well done & worthwhile, worth reading - glad I bought it & read it."
2,Too Obviously a Beginner-Writer,"As with so many inexperienced writers, this novel gives away a lot more about the writer than the written-about. Hopefully, Ms. Read's personality is not as harsh as her semi-autobiographical writing would imply. The plot was workable, the protagonist credible (if a bit obnoxious) but the rest of the characters were portrayed negatively. Also, 6 pages of the author's autobiography - complete with pictures - was more than I wanted to know."
1,Only Need to Read the Last Few Pages,"This was the first time I've read a novel by Anita Shreve and it will be the last. The writing was dull and the story simply plodded along. This book was a chore to read. The ""surprise"" ending is contrived and seemed as though the author simply could not figure out how the book should end and pulled a rabbit out of her hat.A disappointing piece of writing and I simply cannot recommend this book to anyone."
2,Ending Felt Like a Cheap Trick,"I loved ""Strange Fits of Passion"", and was looking forward to this book as my second date with Anita Shreve. However, I was very disappointed. I liked it enough going along to overlook certain problems, such as the only-somewhat-believable passion between the protagonists and the occasionally-unrealistic dialogue. However, at the very end of this book, information is revealed that pulls the rug out from under the whole rest of the story. The ending wound up feeling to me like a gimmick.I tried for several days to ponder it, but could never fully make sense of the story. Did Thomas really go to Africa? really marry Regina? if so, what really broke them up? etc etc I think I vaguely understand what she may have been trying to do here, but it just didn't work for me at all."
1,What a stupid book,"This book was very easy to put down. I only read to the end of it just because once I start something, I don't quit. I kept reading other books in between, it was that tedious. There were parts that were extremely boring that you really wanted to skip over them. The ending, well, you felt like you had just wasted your entire reading time because none of it really happened. What a poor jokester this author is. No one imagines all of their future that will never be as their life flashes before their eyes in the moments before death.What did someone say about it being reminscent of the shower scene after the entire season of Dallas after Bobby was shot? Well, they described it well. You get involved with the details to find out later none of it ever happened."
2,Disappointed--Like So Many Others,"When I finished this book, I felt like I had been slapped across the face. I had thought it so very good, beautifully written and cleverly structured. The sections on Africa were truly well-done and enlightening. And then came the end. I don't believe I have ever been so angry with a book--with an author. My face actually burned. To me, the ending cheapened the entire work. It was NOT clever. And no, it is not that we always have to have a happy ending. I wept at the end of Cold Mountain but know that book could not have ended any other way. I would love to hear what must have been some very interesting discussions between the author and her editor. It takes so long to write a book. You care about it, you're with the characters and the story every single day. And then to do this? As if it has all been a trick, a joke? While reading this book, I was excited about it and had planned to rave about it to all my friends. Not now."
3,Great until the ending for me.,"I was very entertained all the way through this novel until the very end. I won't spoil it with details. I just suddenly felt betrayed. The twilight zone/Stephen Kingesque last page negated all that came before for me. I felt somewhat the same with the movie, ""Atonement"".This is an excellent writer. Her use of style to represent the mood/attitude of each section of the book was revelatory to me. Her small nuances of description are truly evocative. I enjoyed this book up until the very end. Again - I felt betrayed by the ending.Try ""The Time-Traveler's Wife"" for a better book with similar aims.In my opinion, of course."
2,Good until the horrible ending,"This is a compelling love story, told backwards in time. Two poets meet at age 52, at age 26, and at age 17. There are hints of tragic things that happened in the past, and the story unfolds in a page-turning kind of interest: you care about the characters and want to learn more about them.HOWEVER, please do not read the last page! I thought it was gimmicky, and unnecessary. If the last page is true, then the whole rest of the book would make NO sense. It's like the author just tacked on a ""suprise"" ending for no reason, even though it completely contradicts any logical reading of the rest of the book."
3,It broke my heart,"While there were slow sections--especially in the beginning--I fell in love with the love story between Linda and Thomas, and wanted more about their past before Anita Shreve would give it to me. The ending absolutely shocked me. I immediately started back at the beginning to try to understand why I didn't pick up on it before. I can't get it out of my system. It broke my heart."
3,"Almost Didn't Finish It, BUT...","My first (and only) Shreeve book up until now was ""The Pilots Wife"", which I read in two days (and recommended to everyone). I was looking forward to reading this one, being so impressed with her other book. Alas, excitement turned to disappointment, which turned to boredom, until Part 3. I almost closed the book for good before that, yet kept hearing about the ""surprise"" ending; which didn't surprise me much at all (pay attention to how parts 1 and 2 are written distinctively different from part 3), but did in fact delight me. Shreeve writes the final ending so beautifully, you end up forgiving her for dragging you through this book for 300+ pages."
4,Her best yet,"I've read a couple other books by Anita Shreve, and this one was by far her best. The story is good, and the drama builds as the book goes on. She does a great job of creating two characters that you care about, and the ending is really good."
1,This book is AWFUL!!,I can't imagine a publisher accepting this book for publication. It's boring and a total waste of time. Some authors truly are one book authors. Anita Shreve is one of those!
2,I felt ripped off!!!,"It is hard to discuss the reasons why I felt betrayed by this book without giving away too much, but suffice it to say that the ending of this book left me with a feeling of ""Why did I bother?"" In addition to the let down I felt at the end, I found that Shreve described every detail ad nauseum. I felt the need to break out the thesaurus on more than one occasion just to make sure I really knew what she was driving at.I haven't read Weight of Water, so I did not know Thomas going into this book. Maybe if I had, I would have felt more connected, but in the end, I really felt as though the whole novel was a waste of time; a waste of my time, a waste of Shreve's time and especially a waste of time and energy on behalf of these characters.In my opinion: Not one of Shreve's best."
1,Disappointed,"I have read all of Anita Shreves books and have enjoyed them , however her latest novel has left me wondering if she wrote this book or had one of her students write it. The ending was disappointing and I found myself daydreaming about other things while I was reading the ""meat of the novel"" perhaps that is why I did not understand the ending. I hope in the future Ms Shreve will cover some new subjects she is a wonderful storeteller and I will give her another chance, however I couldn't get over the feeling of being gyped and wanted my money and time back after reading the novel Good luck in the future Ms Shreve - Stick to the basics and let Hollywood have the crazy endings...."
2,$2.00 Too Much!,"Some time ago, I picked up this Audio Book @ a Public Library book sale. I just listened to it this week while traveling on vacation. I had never read Anita Shreve but the title sounded interesting and the price was right! The teen age years: not believable. The description of Africa: made me think she had truly spent time there. Very interesting. The ending: SO ridiculousI thought I had missed something while listening(CD skipped?). I had to check it out on line to see if I was mistaken. NOPE!!!"
4,It's all worth the time spent in Africa,"The true beauty of this novel lies in Anita Shreve's description of the time spent in Africa...I was almost in tears when that section was over. Shreve's descriptions of the time Thomas and Linda spent in Africa made the whole novel one I couldn't put down...and will never forget. I truly felt as if I had been there with them in Africa. The first section was the slowest, but I found the last section beautifully written too...but ah, it is all worth the time spent in Africa!"
2,d isappointed,"I found this book to be too contrived. As Shreve kept shifting back and forth in time she kept hinting about deep secrets that would be revealed as the book evolved. The anticipated hidden facts were really not worth waiting for. I found the characters selfish and self-involved. The fact that they were ""artistic"" and thus more sensitive (for themselves) allowed them to hurt others. The ending disproved the entire premise of this book."
2,Confused,"What exactly was the ""twist"" at the end? I consider myself pretty intelligent and I read a lot but I couldn't figure out the end. The story was interesting enough although I had no problem putting the book down and doing something else and I usually have trouble when I'm in the middle of a great book. The characters were not particularly credible, but my biggest question is - what exactly happened at the end? Not highly recommended."
1,What kind of ending is this!!?,"Anita Shreve could've gotten away with a happy ending. She is an enormously gifted writer and this book is a true testament to that. However, she truly blew-it in the ending. I felt cheated and used - like I was the blunt of some stupid joke. I would've put Shreve's talent above ending this book on the last page -- in the way it was done. An insult to both myself and the author."
2,Hated the ending,"I enjoyed the book, but think that the ending is a terrible betrayal of the reader and the characters. Its just doesn't fit. Like she didn't know how to end the book and took the easy clever way out."
2,No More Shreve For Me,"I was looking forward to reading this latest novel of Anita Shreves. I loved Strange Fits of Passion, but this story doesn't even come close to that. As other reviewers here have said, it took a while to become involved in the story line, and the chapters that took place in Africa were sometimes grueling to get through. But, because I liked Linda and Thomas I plowed through the boring parts expecting the book to have a plausable ending (who would have thought it wouldn't?). The ending was, to say the least, a shock, and not at all plausable. I also agree with a reviewer here who stated that this was a ""mean trick to play on the reader"". Was that Shreve's purpose? Did she want to have readers sit staring at the last page totally dumbfounded. Like another of the reviewers, I am also a mental health professional, and I have to ask myself, why would an well-loved author play a nasty trick like this?"
1,Too Depressing to Be a Good Read,"I am an avid reader and I read for enjoyment. Many novels have tragic events which cause the reader sadness; however, ""The Last Time They Met"" is too depressing to enjoy. Whatever hopes you have for the characters are terribly crushed by the ending. Do not look for any happiness in this book."
4,A Reader,"Before you take anyone's word on how much they hated or loved this book, take a glance at their other reviews. If they're mostly reading sci-fi and they loathed this book, do you really trust them to advise you?I enjoyed this book immensely, and will now be reading the rest of Ms. Shreve's work."
3,Please explain.,How can i rate this book when I don't understand it. what happened in the end? Was this all made up? Someone please explain it to me in one of your reviews.
5,seen myself in certain characters,What a good book. I seen myself and others around me in the characters. They were completely believable. I enjoyed the story and was very interested to find out what happened. The ending is completely shocking. It's a book that I will read again just to enjoy Shreve's wonderful way of telling the story. When I finished I wanted to almost immediately go back and start again to see if there was anything I had missed.
3,Could have been great.,"At first I enjoyed reading The Last Time They Met. But the plot seemed to drag at points. And then I came to the end. The end ruined the entire novel. I've never read Anita Shreve's novels before, and the ending to this one makes it unlikely that I will read another. I'm not a fan of the ""OMG shocking ending"" especially when it is not even a page long."
2,The Last Time They Met,"I was disappointed by this book. I had expected better after all the praise for Ms. Shreve's works. The beginning seemed to drag on chapter after chapter with overwhelming details that didn't seem necessary. The imagery was good, but the characters themselves did not interest me at all."
2,ug!,"I'm sorry. I wish I could get my money back on this book. It was far too depressing, so had to toss it in the garbage after halfway through the catterwolling and moaning! What a waste, and the author obviously detests fat people and old people. save your money"
4,wow!,"A very good read- I'd recommend it without reservation. Beautifully and intelligently written, a compelling story, exotic locales, and an ending that makes you think and think... What more could you want?"
2,Better ways to get this story,"If you want to read about the anguish of adultery, try Anna Karenina. If you want to read about Africa, try Out of Africa. If you want star crossed teenaged lovers, try Romeo and Juliet. If you want a twist ending, rent The Sixth Sense. Put all that together and you'll still come out ahead over buying or reading this book. It's got great themes, they've just all been done,,,,and way better I might add."
2,Climactic disappointment,"Although I had looked forward to reading this book, I was very disappointed. It started slowly, and I did not become interested in the characters until near the middle of the story. However, after reading the last page, I felt my investment in the characters had been a waste. I am a fan of the Weight of Water, and I know that Thomas is self destructive, but this ending left me flat.I love Shreve and find her work interesting, but next time I will pay closer attention to the reviews before buying the book."
5,Something to think about...,"This novel kept me intrigued from start to finish. This was my first Anita Shreve novel and I must admit that I was very pleased with my adventure. I had to read the ending a few times over to assure myself that I read correctly since it was so profound. I see that a lot of people seem to be disappointed by the ending -- but I have to admit that it just made me admire the writing even more due to the reality of the situation. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a story that is NOT the ""fairy tale"" ending. It really make you think..."
5,Singing so pure,This was when the singing was so pure and innocent. Great CD. I still listen to it often.
5,Classic,I love this album cause it brings me back to the same period in my life everytime i listen to it. Great melodies simple easy to listen to lyrics.
4,Still a good album!!,"Im listening to the samples provided here as a I write this and I cant help but to reminisce to a time when young pop singers such as Brandy, Aaliyah and Monica actually proved that youth does not equal immaturity..Case in point, Im still feeling the songs on here..Granted, Im a few years younger than they are now, but at that time, I would rock all of their albums till I couldnt recognize the voices anymore..But to get back to Brandy's album, even though the songs sound dated now, at that time, my fave songs were Baby, Broken hearted, Best Friend, Sunny Day, Love is on my side, pretty much the whole album..She is a good singer and I love how her voice is deep like it is.. She works with good producers to make an album worthy enough to listen to..Thank God that she is still around to make good music!!"
4,quick shipping,"The seller sent it out quickly and the book was in the condition specified. The book itself is a treasure other than a few chapters toward the end that seem a little unrealistic, when the author surmises improbable ways to re-introduce the subject into society. The history was beautifully portrayed."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"This card has been a great disappointment to me. It's slow in almost all my games such as Descent3, Quake 3, Need for Speed: High Stakes, and many others. So what that it does 32-bit rendering! On the screen there is practically no difference in color compared to the other cards. So what that it has 32 MB RAM! The only thing that much RAM is good for is high resolutions such as 1280x1024 and you're going nowhere without performance of a fast graphics chip which the nVidia Riva TNT2 Ultra (one big flashy name) does NOT have! Also the card does not support Glide which is the fastest API out now and most games use it. Compared to a V3 3000 AGP, this card is left coughing in the dust."
5,Extremely helpful video for seniors or the disabled!,"I actually bought this video too late. Both my mother and mother-in-law fell within 24 hours of each other. These women are not what I consider ""elderly""- in their early 70's - and healthy. However, their balance, depth perception, bone strength, etc., are starting to deteriorate.My mother-in-law is facing a very lengthy rehabilitation on her hand & wrist, and my mother still has pain when walking. This all could have been avoided if we had followed some of the very simle and easy to implement techniques that Ms. Schlenker demonstrates. Don't wait until it's too late!!!!!"
5,Nice decorative and usefull bucket,"Nice bucket matches a theme room. It has held up to some hard play and still looks good. Looks like it ,iChat be a color or crayon holder for a while now."
3,Definately not for the beginning MFC-programmer,"Hoping to se the MFC classes in use I picked this book up. Though this book has a lot of great information about different areas of Windows programming its examples are sparse. This would not have been a problem if the book came with a CD containg all source code but it doesn't. You have to download a 3MB file from Sams Publishing and it does not even contain source code from all the chapters and especially not the most exiting ones. A lot of this general information you can find in other books like Dan Appelmans ""Win32 API"" books and even with the online documentation. What I want are examples!!!!Very dissapointing - But it will probably be a valuable book in about 5 - 6 months when other books has showed me HOW to use this information!Terje"
3,"A good book, but the CD-ROM is NOT INCLUDED !!!!","The site present the follow information about the book: "" From the Publisher : A comprehensive introduction to the advanced features of the new Visual C++, this complete and thorough guide takes users step by step through the process of building applications for Win32 and highlights the most useful APIs and SDKs. - Documents the development of two full-featured examples, including a scaleable drawing application - Explores the development of custom controls, programming with ActiveX, DAO programming, DirectX 3.0 graphics and sound, and much more - CD-ROM is loaded with full source code and executables "" BUT THE CD-ROM IS NOT INCLUDED AT BOOK!!!, WHERE CAN I FOUND IT? THE BOOK'S EXAMPLES REFERS THE CD, BUT NOT REFER WHERE IS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT APTITUDE, IF THE EXAMPLE'S CODE SOURCE IS INCLUDED IN THE CD THEM PLEASE!!! INCLUDE THE CD IN THE BOOK. JORGE CHEVALIER"
3,Cuts quick,"3 1/2Beautifully transportive, landmark electronic score can feel overly repetitious in its once trailblazing ambient palate, but still manages to stay true to a visionary nature and dazzles far more than anything else."
4,has its ups and downs,"The fine thing about CDs is you can just skip the tracks you don't like, as if they weren't even there. Some of the tracks (the ones with dialogue samples from the movie, basically) don't appeal to me much sometimes, so I skip right to the superb ""Tales of the Future"", ""Damask Rose"", ""Memories of Green"", and ""Blade Runner Blues"". Those alone make the disk worth owning."
4,Best Nugent album in awhile,"This is easily Ted Nugent's best album since the '70s. It blows previous albums such as Penetrator and Little Miss Dangerous out of the water. Getting Derek St. Holmes back in the fold was a smart move as Ted sounds rejuvenated here. There's lots of good songs here like ""Heart and Soul"", ""Hot or Cold"", ""Thighraceous"", and ""Lovejacker."" Longer tracks such as ""Tooth, Fang, and Claw"" and ""Fred Bear"" are as strong as the songs on his '70s albums. Some of the other tracks such as ""Wrong Side of Town"", ""Primitive Man"", and ""Just Do It Like This"" aren't up to par with the rest of the album. Still this is a return to form as the good far outweighs the bad."
5,Read it over and over again,"This book should be required reading for everyone and anyone. Now a classic in the world of relationships. It is so full of insights and understanding I can't even sum them up, though some of the reviews here give you some more detail. Whether you are married, single, hurting, or even think everything is ""just fine"", you need to read this book. Learn about yourself and about you in relationships in so many ways that sound completely familiar yet will feel eye-opening. It's that good."
4,great boomer memories,I remember how the original versions sounded. I expect a remake to have something of value either a fresh new take or a different feel than the original. Most of the selections (but not all) do live up to this criteria...hence the four out of five stars. My wife enjoys some of these versions better than the original! What else do you need to know!
1,False advertising HUGE waste of money,"When I seek out a cappella music I want the literal translation. ""Without instrumental accompaniment"". This cd fell short - like completely missed the rotation of the earth short.On the other hand when I purchase an ""instrumental"" cd I don't want to hear anything BUT instrumental.This cd was a big waste of my money and time. My only consolation is writing a review that might perhaps warn others that they will NOT get a capella music on this cd."
4,"nice sound, very slim body","i feel bit disappointed after listening to some mp3 format songs. the sound is not that good, as if there is a layer right between you and the sound. see? but overall, it's real handy, you dont even feel anything stick on your body while doing exercise, etc. i like this."
5,Absolutley Awesome,The Harry Potter books are so amazing even in Spanish. The translation is awesome and it's really nice for me too because i'm fluent in Spanish. It's really fun to read and i'm sure you'll enjoy it
2,Another fiction presented as fact!,"Thailand is a small place. Especially northern Thailand. All the expats know each other and are easily recognized in this fictional account of a gay man trying for macho. While there are pieces of truth intersperced though the book, Graceffo seems to need to embellish his characters with nasty habits. Give the candy then take it away. What I found most offensive was his opening statement,""This book is based on true events."" In a word..... horsepucky! So many of these 'true events' never happened, that with a single character I was able to count five different things that I know for sure never occured. You see... I was that character."
3,Genuine Adventurer,"Antonio Graceffo first contacted us at Hackwriters.com when he first quit his job and arrived broke in Asia. He began submitting his extraordinary tales of adventure no matter how hungry he was, or what kind of situation he was in. This is a man who really got to grips with making contact with other nations and living the life like Indiana Jones. He really did paddle down whole rivers, make kick-boxing movies, live with the hilltribes and somehow always found an internet connection to send his reports back. Brave, slightly crazy, he is an inspiration to anyone who seeks adventure in wild territory. Read this book, you may want to quit your job and try it yourself. Make sure you have the guts Antonio Graceffo has, it's tough out there."
4,"Very solid, substantive guidance for launching a consultancy","With today's massive layoffs and not-so-voluntary early retirements, more people are entering the ranks of consultants than ever before. If you have never been self-employed, had to rustle up clients and build a business, this can be rather frightening. Let Tim Foster's book serve as your guide. His advice is uniformly sound and comprehensive. It's even organized so that you can work your way through the recommended steps and check them off as done. So whether you've been an engineer or a sales executive, whether you hate making cold calls or don't mind talking your way into an appointment, you'll find suitable, reliable guidance here."
1,Lasted 2 days,I'm very displeased with the Cobra PR 950-2 DX.I got to use mine the total of 5 minutes before one of the radios decided to die. Not a very good service life is it?Now I have to send it in and have it repaired. I wonder what will happen next and how long they will last when I get them back.
2,A Shallow Mess,"This is definitely not one of the best National Lampoon movies. It takes place in a college dorm filled with your stereotypical sexually charged males and airhead females. One of the male students hires a prostitute, named Dominique. However, she quickly becomes confused with a French foreign exchange student, also named Dominique. This does draw a few laugh out loud moments. However, most of the film is spent showing the characters chasing each other through the dorm, looking for a purse full of money. Where the money came from is never adequately explained. All we know is it was the result of some crooked operation. After the first hour, you just wish the movie would come to an end. But it drags on for another 35 minutes. The only person who made this movie tolerable was Boti Bliss as Dominique (the prostitute). She is a beautiful women. And she does have a partial nude scene in the film."
1,"After one season, it's falling apart.","I bought this hammock for my husband for Father's Day 2002. We stored it inside during the winter months. Still, this spring one of the ropes has popped. I imagine others will follow. Bummer."
4,Good Product Value for the Price!,"While we have owned more expensive rope hammocks in the past, this definitely is a good value for the money. More than adequate in size for comfortably snuggling two under the stars!"
3,Interesting old handwritten synposis,"This is a personal compilation of information about costumes 1830-1908. All the illustrations appear to be hand drawn and the text is in the authors handwriting.Content reviews attire worn for different occasions such as school, shopping skating and so on. The text reviews manners, difficulties associated with wearing the clothes and descriptions of some of the clothing. it reviews primarily female clothing. Amateurish but interesting."
4,"If considering the trilogy, read at least through Green Mars","I liked this much more than Red Mars, but the plodding nature of some of the prose still kept it from being a 5-star review.Green Mars delves (to its benefit) much deeper into the human and sociopolitical side of the story. The agonizing ""travelogues"" of Red Mars are mercifully truncated (most of the time, though occasionally replaced by equally dense forays into the mechanics of lichens). The historical sweep is wonderful and, amazingly, continues to be plausible.Perhaps the most interesting facet of the book - almost a central theme - is an exploration of what it would be like to live to 140, on a very personal level. Robinson handles this extremely well and brings a fair bit of creativity and color to the topic. It helps to humanize and build engagement with the characters, something I thought was lacking in the first book.Overall, if you made it through the first book ... Keep reading. The story is rich, deep and rewarding."
5,One of the best hard sci-fi ever,"Having finished the astonishing ""Red Mars"", this sequel reveals masterpiece at work from Kim Stanley Robinson. Both books are deep and maybe the most scientifically accurate I've ever read (and I'm an engineer...). Not so recommended for sci-fi initiates as it's a dense reading, but it's definitely worth for hard sci-fi readers."
4,"Too much aerology, not enough PEOPLE drama","I loved Red Mars, first in the trilogy, despite the limitations of its 1990's viewpoint. But in this book, and in Blue Mars that follows, Robinson is entirely too obsessed with describing the climate and topography of the planet. There's too little of the political, social and human drama that makes science fiction work for me. The relationships between the First Hundred, the death of John and Frank, the arguments about the role of a colony for a dying earth--these are barely touched on, while every crevasse and rock formation gets pages of description."
1,"Boring, boring, boring and dull, dull, dull","I waded through Red Mars and have been given Green Mars as a present. I haven't finished reading it yet and really don't know if I can be bothered wasting the time to complete this.It's a terrible novel, very badly written and if the attitudes expressed in the book actually reflect those of the author, then... (propriety and adherence to the guidelines for submissions to Amazon prevent me from completing this statement).It certainly should win a prize as one of the most boring, poorly written novels ever. I'm wondering if I can exchange the book for something more readable and enjoyable-in fact, anything would be better than this!"
1,Too much detail,I think this book has too much detail with the topics it includes and it misses many pathologic diseases that are included in other reviews. I would definitely not use only this book for review.
3,Plain and simple,"Well, there isn't much to say about this book other than it was a cozy, meandering read that doesn't take a lot of energy or concentration to read. Nothing happens in this book, either. However, I learned something about the Shaker way that I hadn't known before. It was entertaining in that respect, but nothing more. Would probably only appeal to those interested in Shakers."
2,all right,"ALas, I cannot dscribe this book as exceptional, or even very good. Although the author attempts to transport the reader into her place at all times with limited success, the reader puts herself at risk of boredom. The feelings of the author take some work on the readers part to conjure, and over all, a reader looking for a book with meaning and adventure should look elsewhere."
3,Good if you like the Berenstain Bears,"I was looking for a book about bad dreams, and since the kids like the BB, this seemed like a lock. And in general, it is good, but it takes FOREVER to get to the actual bad dream part! The majority of the book is setting up all the things the cubs did all day which then precipitated the bad dreams. Then only about 4 pages are spent dealing with the actual dream. So that was a bit disappointing, but it is still entertaining and you can certainly use it as a jumping-off point to discuss bad dreams. (It is based on a TV episode that we've seen since.)"
1,Bad Dreams Begone...With Help from the Bear Family!,"I loved this book, because it is a wonderful ""bad dream banisher"" for children of any age. Brother and Sister Bear are so much like normal, you-and-me kids that any child will understand where they're coming from. This book has helped all of the children in my family deal with nightmares...Definately a must-have for any Bear Family fans!"
2,Can't Use Handle,"I'm very disappointed with this carrier. I can not use it for our 14 lb cat because the top door pops open when lifted by the handle. Then when you want to open the top door, you can't because of the poor design of the catches. The top metal wires are all bent up from trying to pop the top open. Seemed like a good design, but I'm sorry I bought it."
3,Difficult assembly,"Very well made and sturdy. However, the assembly directions were pictures only and very difficult to understand. It was hard to figure out which piece they were referring to."
5,Wish they had these in Target stores,"Great product!!!! Cleans teeth and gums at the same time. Using this brush has made my gums stronger and teeth whiter!!!I recommend this to everybody that has a mouth""LOL"""
2,Used To Be Useful,"Originally published in 1984, this guide is less than useful now. We've discovered that Lake Erie having dropped 3 feet in the last few years has significantly changed the river levels. Maybe the authors/editors could make a return trip?"
3,Culture Matters but we should come out of it,"I agree culture matters for everything, that makes human life more interesting.But at the same time it is the cause for our most problems.We should get rid of it, otherwise there will be no cure for todays almost all problems."
5,"Light and Strong, what more is needed.","These are perfect, they are strong, hand grips are comfortable and they hold their shape. They are laundry baskets, what more do you need than that."
4,Interesting,"The bap handbook is about the life of upper class black women who are put in four different categories, Bettys, who's always been rich, Boho, they are rich,but try to live like they are not. Butterflies, may not come from money, but their parents go out of their way to make sure they live like a Betty, and a Bogus, who's not really rich but act like it. I throught the book was an interesting concept."
4,What a Hoot!!!,"I thought this book was great! This book is not for the hoochie coochie mamas among us (who get too much pub and probably don't read anyway), but for sistas everywhere who are using the good sense that their mamas gave 'em!! Yes, it is a little pretentious and snotty from time to time, but that's what made it so funny. Great job ladies - can't wait for your next offering!!!!"
5,Calling all BAPS!!!!,"If you are a BAP, then this lighthearted book is for you! The authors do a great job outlining the do's and dont's of BAPdom.I bought this book the day it was released and, literally got my local B&N salesperson to take them out of the boxes, because they hadn't yet been shelved!While some who are Boho's may find the book pretentious, it's aim is not to offend. It's a quick study, as implied in the title, into the world of Upper-class African-American culture.Most of my friends are Betty's, Bohos, or Butterflies, and all in my circle who read it, loved it.I highly recommend this witty, unprecedented, and informative guide."
3,"About mystery, grace...","Read for a college Theology class. Difficult to follow & hard to understand at times. But, it has some good points about mystery, grace."
5,Soulmates: Following inner guidance to the relationship of y,"Wonderful, wonderful book!!!! It provided me the insights and tools that I needed to recognize my future soulmate. I am now involved in a fabulous relationship that probably would never have evolved without the help and guidance that I gained from this book. I've since ordered copies for my two best friends who, like me, have struggled with relationships in the past."
1,UGH!,"For some reason the machin jumps when it prints destroying documents! It angered me, especially since the machine stopped in the middle of print jobs. At the end of the day I just wanted to cry."
2,poor quality photography,"poor quality photography - murky water, images often not sharp, poor focus....recommend:Reefscapes: Nature's Aquarium DVD (2nd Edition - widescreen)it's very high quality"
2,Genevieve Can't Do the Robot,My daughter thought from the commercials that Princess Genevieve would be able to do a lot more dances than she can actually do. The wearable arm and foot controllers don't work like she thought they would either and the doll occasionally gets stuck while dancing.
1,Don't waste your money! This thing is junk!!! 0 stars.,"Very disappointed young lady at Christmas. Never functioned correctly. The best it would do was occasionally move but never in relation to the movement of the child or adult. Don't waste your money. If I could give it a 0 star, I would. Junk! Junk! Junk!"
2,Not very entertaining,"My four-and-a-half-year-old daughter had to have this toy and so with money she had gotten for christmas, we ordered it. So not worth it. She finds the bracelets needed to strap on uncomfortable and itchy, the movements are akward and don't really follow your child and she has lost all interest in this. It has become another dust collector. She is an avid Barbie doll worshiper who spends hours each day playing and pretending with her other Barbies - but his one is not as much fun as she thought it would be and I agree with her. I would recomend the other Genevieve barbie that twirls when you push her leg ... this one she plays with a lot."
3,Not as good as we thought...,"I had read the reviews but decided to take my chances since my daughter really had her heart set on it for Christmas. It is SO incredibly loud! The doll doesn't follow my daughters movements...just like the other reviews said it wouldn't...I had told her this when she started playing with her and when she came to tell me, neither of us were surprised. We were both disappointed but it is a beautiful doll. Unfortunately, now the doll sits in the playroom looking pretty instead of being played with...an expensive lesson on my part."
3,"Daughter loves it, but it doesn't follow movements","We bought this for my 3yr. old daughter who is in love with Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses. She absolutely loves this and dances in front of the doll with the wristbands for long periods of time. However, the doll doesn't really follow your movements and actually does the opposite of what you're doing. Our entire family tried to get this doll to follow our movements with no success. Luckily my daughter is too young to realize what the bands are really for and is really just interested in dancing with the doll. This would've received 5 stars if the doll actually worked properly."
3,Disappointing,"Was disppointed in this doll, movements are louder than expected and it clicks alot. Does not follow along very well at all in the ""teach me"" mode. But my 5 y/o absolutely loves it, and that's what matters!"
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!,"I thought my daughter, who loves to dance would love this! The doll doesn't move with my daugheter at all on the follow your child mode!!! It's movements are really slow & my daughter says the bands are uncomfortable. The doll also does the same movement over and over again on the follow the doll mode. It's very frustrating!!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"They need to ship this back to China. What an expensive, overrated, piece of plastic clicking junk. Mattel, you should be ashamed of yourselves putting this product on the market and raping the blue collar man of his hard earned money. My daughter was anticipating getting this from Santa. Of course, Santa brings it. The most exciting part of this toy, was watching her rip it out of the paper and box. To her dismay, and crocodile tears, it did NOTHING like the commercial. We traded it for ""Bella Dancerella"". Now she has a toy that she is content with. Seriously, if you want a good toy, DO NOT buy this Barbie product."
3,Dancing Barbie,"My husband thought our 3 year old daughter would love this toy for Christmas as she's a dancer herself. However, it was somewhat difficult to make it work correctly. The arm and leg ""bands"" are bulky and she only played with it for 5 minutes before she got frustrated. I played with it myself to see how it worked and it's definately not as easy to use as they show in the commercials. It's a neat concept but probably not appropriate for a 3 year old."
3,Not as entertaining as expected,My 4 and a half year old received this for Christmas and was a little disappointed with it right away. The reactions of Barbie to what you do are not as good as expected. She was done playing with it after about 20 minutes because of frustration. Now she just plays with the doll on its own.
3,Could be better,This toy could be better. The arm of the doll sticks at times. The mechanics are loud. It still brings a smile to my childs face though. So I guess it was worth it. I am glad I found it on Amazon.com because the regular store price would have been to much for this doll.
4,Ace if you're a local,"Which, as it happens, I am. Pretty well everywhere in the book, at least on the Veritie side, is accurately the town where I live, and that makes for a lot of fun for the local reader (only Blackacre Farm is made up out of the whole cloth, SFAIK). How much that is worth to a reader 4000 miles away, I am not sure, but I think it probably helps to give the book depth.The book *is* very chatty and the plot a tad predictable, but it's pretty well written, and I suspect that it serves as the introductory volume of a series. I hope so. I'm not particularly taken by the Haven books, but I would certainly follow if it develops as a series."
1,Barfly PAL region Oops!,"I made the mistake of purchasing this DVD before looking into what PAL meant or which region it would work in. I am very disappointed in how easy it is to make this mistake. BUYER BEWARE! On a good note, the price was great and the shipping was quick, I just wish it worked in the USA!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Masterpiece,"I really enjoy(ed) this movie. In fact I don't treat it as a movie at all, I treat it like one of my favorite CDs. I put it in while I'm preparing a meal and it gently brings me into another world. So I guess what I like about it is the realism of the characters, as far as the 9 or 10 major actors go its absolutely perfect. I think I've watched it about 30 times."
1,Barfly Unplayable,"The DVD did not play on any of my DVD/BluRay equipment because they could not read the PAL format. This is a first for any Amazon product I have previously purchased. I rated this purchase one star because the DVD did arrive on schedule, though it was unplayable."
1,oh no!!!!,They changed the formulation! This was once the best candy in the world. I lost 50 pounds eating these things....but no longer. I sure hope this aberration is limited to this vendor!
1,Aweful!,Why use this title? Why Ms. Shahade? You're supposed to be our role model. Most of the female players in the 70's and 80's are lesbians? What's this about? It's pure gossip and speculation. This book is shockingly bad.
1,Total gossip,"I have several problems with Chess Bitch. It's unorganized and the research was sloppily done. After reading it, I still don't get what the author is trying to achieve. The book is completely lack of focus and direction. It seems that it's part chess history, part gossip, part revenge and part of everything else thrown in.Some characters in Chess Bitch were made to look very bad such as Rachel Crotto, Liz Vicary, Alex Shabalov, Irina Krush, Sasha Kosteniuk, etc. Not sure why but it seems that way.The most silly mistake is Kasparov being a World Champion in 1980. Jenny also made Kasparov look very bad. One has to assume for personal reason. I hope the next book will be better. This one is quite disappointing. There were also oodles of other mistakes and poor research.Overall, the book is perfect for the liberal left wing feminists. On the other hand, it's not recommended for the rest. You'd be blacklisted and laughed at if you publish a book like this in some serious chess country."
2,Generation gap,"I met Ms. Shahade twice. She's a dynamic speaker and a beautiful young lady. However, this book doesn't match her qualities. One of the mistakes I found so far is Kasparov didn't become World Champion in 1980. Karpov was the Champion then. There were a few others.Perhaps I don't understand the feminist movement or perhaps we have a generation gap but I just don't understand the title. If you want to create a controversy to sell books then you got what you wanted. I view the title as a negative and for this reason alone, I cannot recommend this book to young people."
5,A great CD,I've become a big fan of Jim Henry and this CD is a good place to start. It's worthy every penny.
5,Great Product,"Before I started taking this, I was real forgetful and I have only been taking this for a few weeks and already I can see a change. I would recommend it to anyone who is having trouble remembering and, also, it helps the nervous system and Amazon is a great place to order this product."
5,Different mezzo voice,"By far, this is not a voice like Bartoli's. It is quite different and can not be compared to anyone else. You will not find the chest notes of Horne, neither Bartoli's charm. I am not an expert, but I can tell you that the security and the power contained in this bulgarian mezzo is worth trying."
5,The White City,I have been reseaching a relative for about 10 years and I found that he had been an exhibitor at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago when I checked the exhibits in the book.
1,One dissenting voice,"I just could not get into this book. The pace is glacially slow, and the voice painful -- there is a singsong quality that is so sappy I just couldn't read on. I seem to be in the minority here, so my suggestion to you is to read the first page or two before buying and see if you can stand the voice. Some people love it, but you may not agree. I didn't."
2,Disappointed!,"I have already written a review for this product. The book looked good when it arrived and it arrived on time. I was not aware of the delicate nature of the binding and it fell apart as I was reading. I wrote a review indicating my displeasure.The seller promptly replied indicating that those ""pulp"" paperbacks were poorly constructed and no one could predict when the binding might go although they said they do check the books. I did not ask for a refund. I am still annoyed because even a book that is said to be in ""fair"" condition should certainly allow the reader one read through before it falls apart in your hands. So BUYER BEWARE!"
4,a era we all wanted to live,"I seen this movie at the theatre when it was released,because it starred a guy i went to high school withken wahl.this historical aspect on what gang life may have been likein 1963, sorta a serious west side storey.i also boight the soundtrack album and now have iton cd as well.good movie for a saturday afternoon"
3,Finding My True Self,"Foundations: A Novel of New Beginnings is described as a story of four characters and their original foundations in life coupled with new foundations in adulthood. However, we are given an additional character's story, his foundation and coming of age that is sad and touching.Rachel, Walter, Sheila, and Christina are four young adults harboring secrets that greatly affect their lives. While parading through their daily escapes, unbeknownst, their secrets will creep up, crash and burn. You have a total of five characters, all from vastly different socioeconomic backgrounds, intertwined to tell a great story.While I enjoyed the storyline, the message and exciting climaxes, it falls short because of the grammatical errors. However, with some fine-tuning at proofreading this can be an enjoyable story. Foundations: A Novel of New Beginnings is look at how we can create new foundations to begin again.Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves"
4,A mixture of Mechanical Animals and Anti Christ Superstar,"Here is a review based on the fact I do not pay attention to what Manson is singing about.If I want to place the importance of lyrics in the music, I will listen to Folk or Rap.Manson has always appealed to me because of the progressive music and the production of it.The production is better than Animals but not as good as the Reznor produced Superstar.The writing of bassist Berkowitz and music contribution of keyboardist/programmer Gacy is much stronger than in Animals, but not as good as SuperstarWith Superstar ranking my favourite and Portrait of an American Family my second favourite, this cd falls a notice below to my third favourite because of the reznor production on Familyif a ten rating it gets 7/10"
3,Disapointed,"I expected something like the ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR, in my opinion the cd starts real good, with songs like the fight song and disposable teens wich are really good, but at the same time that advances the cd goes worst and worst.WHEN WILL THE REVEREND GIVE US ANOTHER MONUMENTAL CD AS THE ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR?"
5,Big Island View,"I've never written a review for a cd before, But I feel obligated to now.Now first of all, I'm no kid. I'm a 36 year old guy who thought that all ofrock's greatest albums were in the past. Until now. Manson has put together quite an amazing package here.Of the 19 songs, I can't seem to find any weak spots. Every great band puts out that one defining album, the one that holds up 20 years down the road.This may very well be the one for Marilyn Manson. Don't hesitate on buying this one."
4,ALL OF MARILYN MANSONS FORMATIONS ALL INTO 1!,THIS CD HAS IT ALL! RIGHT FROM HIS SATANIC ANTICHRIST GIMMICK TO HIS NEW APE GIMMICK! I SUDDGEST YOU LISTEN TO THE FIGHT SONG THATS BAD AS HELL! A MUST LISTEN TO IF YOU ARE A MARILYN MANSON FANATIC
3,A weaker effort,"This album is, by far, the weakest of the four Marilyn Manson albums. It lacks the power of Antichrist, the raw emotion of American Family, and the songs of Mechanical Animals. What;s left sounds like mostly B-sides and some experimentation. Its not a bad album, and is better than most out there. Bright spots are the Death Song, The Fight Song, and some of the stuff towards the end. However songs like Disposable Teens make it sound like Manson gave up and is trying to rehash old stuff.Check out the other three albums first, if you have them already by all means go get this, but don't expect it to meet all your expectations."
5,My review for .... Holy Wood,"One word could describe this album... good. I mean, it has The Fight song, The Love Song, Burning Flag, The Nobodies, etc. Its a must have for even people who AREN'T fans. It has a couple of slow songs. This is a album to get your adrenaline, but yet your sadness and thoughts of society and life, going. I picked this up after maybe 3 other MM albums I bought and now I can tell you.. I should of got this one first. Dont let the album cover fool you.. This album is a masterpiece."
5,Great Bargain,I love being able to pick up these used CDs through the Amazon prime program. I am able to keep making my collection grow without spending a bunch of money. As far as content if you like MM then you will like this album as it is one of his better works.
2,geez,"Wow, Marilyn Manson actually has some listenable songs for once. That makes the album passable. Unfortunately he's not a very good songwriter or singer, and the guitar playing is VERY average too. No need to even buy this album because of how average it is for the most part. Just a couple (rather predictable) songwriting moments make a few of the songs tolerable. The obnoxious way the guitar riffs and vocals come across means I give the album a big ""no thanks"". No point going into detail for each song since they all sound the same anyway."
1,Won't open,"I completely expected to LOVE this program...I have Picture IT! 99, 2000, 2001Publishing and 2002 Photo Premium .. I am an avid digital camera user..and wanted this program sooooooo badly..BUT>>I can't even open it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled three times. It keeps telling me some files are missing...I can restart my computer and run set up again..but it doesn't run...I paid [money] for this program today..and it WILL be going back to the store tomorrow."
5,Good low priced quality card.,"Installed this in an older Dell that was given to my son by someone, it has Windows ME on it, the drivers installed easily and fast with enclosed disk. This computer was being used on dialup believe it or not before he got it and so, it didn't have Ethernet or USB ports either, I also rectified this by purchasing a card for the lacking of the USB ports here on Amazon. He's able to get around on the web with it and serves his purpose of at having internet now. And the price was right for the card also since he's on a very tight budget."
3,putting a face an american militia member.,sad... sad... sad... I've read it twice and still don't understand what makes John Pitner tick.
5,Perfect Dark is the amazing prodigy son of Goldeneye,"This is an AMAZING game. If you have played, or own, Goldeneye you will know how afer months of playing it you will eventually tire. But with Perfect Dark's many, many modes, you will never tire of this game. It has very advanced graphics for its time. Its only downside is that it REQUIRES an expansion pak. Overall BUY THIS GAME!!!"
4,"Good, but Could Have Been Great","Granted with a title like ""How Underdog Was Born"", one shouldn't expect much about Total Television's other series like ""King Leonardo"" and ""Tennessee Tuxedo"", but it's here! That's the good thing. The bad thing is that the book ends abruptly after the creation of Underdog save for a couple of paragraphs about ""Commander McBragg"" and ""Klondike Kat"". Then there's a fast forward to the aborted attempt to make new ""Underdog"" episodes. What isn't here is what happened after ""Underdog"", but I guess that could be saved for the sequel? I am glad, however, that it is written by two of the original creators of the series, so it is a first hand view of what really happened.UPDATE: If you like this book, you'll love my new bookCreated and Produced by Total TeleVision Productions"
4,"If one seeks to be well-liked, one may sacrifice their soul.","How far would you go towards being well liked? Would you sacrifice your own identity? This is a deeply philosophical film, one in which it questions certain fundamental assumptions we make on a daily basis. When we're with others, we can choose to be quite similar to the person we're speaking with, or we can choose the path of self-reliance, and be our own man. In this bitter and ironic film, Woody Allen asks us the question -- what is our choice? Individualism or collectivism? To be a yes man is to give away one's identity -- with no apparent benefits."
2,"Man, the 404 comes with a case","I have found very well made and good quality items that were made in China, not this one. First of all the outside leather has a very cheap look and feel. I actually checked again to see if it was made from real leather. And as for the one I got, it wasn't well made either. there's a piece of leather they sewed that does not lay flat. It was sewed in with a slight fold. The ""case""/pouch that comes with the DVR is actually better quality. Best bet is to buy the DVR first and then see if you think the one that comes with it is good enough or wait till a company that make cases, like krussel, come up with one for the Archos 404."
2,Narrow shoes,"Nine West Women's Deltona Flat,Black,9.5 MThey look cute and the texture it's soft, but they are to narrow and these come from a person who doesn't have wide feet. Also to big (long).....I had to gave them away"
1,Coby cassette player,"This product was a piece of junk. Firstly, it didn't have a rewind button on it, and secondly, it never did play or work. I simply threw it in the trash rather than waste the postage and time returning it!"
1,Piece of Junk,"COBY CX-C21 Stereo Cassette PlayerReceived this last week after reading all 17 reviews on Amazon. Feels more awkward than the several Sony Walkmans I have had in the past 25 years. Even the battery compartment is unusually snug. I wanted a simple straight forward tape player without a radio, just for listening to books on tape. Well, within a few days, this unit failed. It broke down while playing the 5th tape! I even tried a couple of brand new blank cassettes, and they wouldn't move, even after cleaning the transport mechanism with isotropic alcohol. It's back to Sony Walkmans for me."
1,Worked for a whole week,"At first I thought, its not too bad for the money- the sound was okay and I didn't expect much for the money. Then, after only using on a limited basis for a week it stopped working. It wasn't the batteries. It just wouldn't play, forward or anything. Waste of money."
2,"Cheap, but works","They still make books on tape and who wants to spend good money on a walkman cassette player? I anticipate that this one will break eventually, but it does what I need for now and it doesn't have the things I don't use, like the radio."
2,Not worth it.,"Purchased 05/06I bought this item because I didn't have a cassette player and I wanted to transfer some old out of print books on tape to mp3. Player worked fine for a while, then it developed a problem while playing, where the device would go from normal play speed to half speed, almost like if the batteries were dying. I guess the motor on this player wore out rather quickly because this kept happening even with fresh batteries."
3,Not bad for such an inexpensive player,"I was surprised with this product, I did not expect it to be as good as it is for the cost. If you are like me and have wonderful old cassettes that would be costly to transfer to CDs but do not want to spend a lot of money on a player this one is the way to do."
2,Typical low quality microsoft,"The game is extremely dumbed down from the Battletech universe in terms of tech flexibility, and has a narrow storyline. It has very good graphics, but it's choppy on about anything less than a 2ghz pentium and/or good graphics card. The music sometimes gets stuck on a single tone and the whole game has crashed several times. The basic game is sold at full price, but crippled - you have to buy half a dozen ""expansion packs"" to get what the game should have started out with.I've played everything to do with Battletech and Mechwarrior since it first came out and love it all, but since Micro$oft bought the game out the quality has continually sank. Get it if you want to play Netmech on a new computer over a cable modem or if you want to just shoot everything up. Don't get it if you're expecting anything from Mechwarrior or Battletech besides the name."
2,Could do Better,"This pak is cool for the new mech models but they are the models that should have stayed in the game. The Kodiak, Cauldron-Born, and Maskari were seen in the MechWarrior 2 Series but they was left ouf of 3 and 4 until now. For this price, there should have been more in it. 10 new mechs would be better and new levels and/or a campaign. MW4: Vengance is REQUIRED, not just any MW4 game right now.The Kodiak and Masakri are stripped of the some of the weapons that make them cool. The Masakri is missing 2 PPC's and the places to mount them and the Kodiak only has 4 medium lasers instead of 8 (4 in each arm). Other than that, try to get it discounted or second hand, and when the next MechWarrior game comes around, demand more out of the game."
1,Coby no sound speakers,They are horrible bought as replacement for my computer speakers and if they are both not sitting right in front of me with the max volume on computer I would not hear a thing!
2,"Well, you get what you pay for","The sound is very poor but this is a nice solution for let's say listening to your iPod while you cook... if it's right there next to you. Also, the sound quality is not so good either.However, this are pretty cheap speakers so you are only receiving what you paid for."
1,Possibly good speakers...if they don't fall apart,"My first warning should have been the branding: the word ""COBY"" stamped on these speakers is clearly meant to be mistaken for ""SONY"". Hilarious. Anyway, I have no opinion of the sound quality of the speakers because the cable broke while trying to remove a piece of packaging tape from it. Just pulled apart -- the wire and the plastic insulation, everything. I tried for a minute or so to splice it back together, but to no avail, and it occurred to me that the time I would spend fixing these speakers would be worth more than the $8 I paid for them.One piece of advice if you buy these speakers: please recycle them when you realize they're garbage. They should never have been made, but they certainly don't belong in a landfill."
1,"Sound OK, but broke quickly","I bought these speakers to use with my laptop.They sound fine -- when they work.The sound quality was what I'd expect from small passive speakers -- and it was better than the laptop's built-in speakers.However, after a month or so, one of the speakers stopped working. I found that twisting the cord could get it to work sometimes. Soon the other one went, and now no amount of twiddling will bring it back to life.You get what you pay for -- these might work for a bit, but they're basically a disposable item."
2,Okay Value for the price...,"I bought these speakers, and honestly...the sound quality is really lacking. My old 1998 Compaq computer speakers delivers 10x the sound that these do. Everything sounds flat, and muted. Great price, but would never, ever buy these again, or recommend these to anyone. BUT, I guess if you're looking for something simple, these might be for you. And by simple, I'm not including listening to music, or watching anything on your comp. Maybe for playing games like Diner Dash..."
4,The book for Mac Fanboys,"Have you ever wondered how crazy Mac/Apple fans are? Well, this is the book to let you know. This book is mainly composed of pictures of crazy Mac/Apple fans and their crazy ways of showing others how much they love Macs. It a good coffee table book to have friends browse through while they are chilling at your house."
2,disappointment,"I have just received, ""Stanley Outdoor Vacuum Bottle 1.1 quart/946ml"". The section about the product-related features explain, 24-hour hot / cold storage capability. And that is the reason why I preferred it. But it is not that explained. However, this statement is wrong and I regret to buy it. People who prefer this product have to know: 12 HOURS OF STORAGE CAPABILITY HOT / WARM STORAGE CAPABILITY 13-18 HOURS (enough to hold your finger in warm water).Thanks to Amazon for sending the product as soon as possible to Afghanistan than I thought."
2,Sub-par electrical diagrams,"I bought this manual to use on an '89 F-150 I had just picked up. Unfortunately I found it had a battery drain somewhere in the electrial which the previous owner failed to mention. Normally this isn't that bad of a situation with a multimenter, a test light, and a short finder as tools to find the problem. But this current draw isn't blowing fuses so it makes things more difficut. The electrial diagrams in this version are almost worthless when trying to do this sort of repairs and have limited experience. Maybe OK for mechanical repairs, but forget about digging deep into the electrial systems."
3,It's a Haynes,"Same review I gave for the Chilton's, another manual, some errors, not everything there, but useful anyway and the price was right."
1,It should be a zero star rating,"I hate to say this, but this book is a waste of paper and ink. It is poorly organized. It reads like somebody just copy and pasted paragraphs and sentences from a million and one source and never ever re-read the paragraph. The chapter headings and paragraph headings mean absolutely nothing. You will find yourself reading a sentence and wondering where is it going, then you will realize that you have no idea where it came from so you just give up and attempt the next section or next paragraph. But no matter how much you skip, you never ever come across anything worthwhile. If you have bought this book, fight hard to get your money back. I wonder if the editor that approved of this book still has a job? I have no idea how it made it to the sixth edition."
3,"Decent overall, had some trouble with it.","The monitor has a nice, flat screen, takes as much space as my old 17"" did, and features an UltraBrite Mode that probably won't be used much by me. The picture quality is pretty good, however, the problem I have with the monitor is that on its sides (especially on the right side), there is somewhat of a blueish hue. However, you really have to look hard to spot it, but it's there. I thought it might have been the monitor itself, so I returned it and got a different one, same model. After plugging it in I noticed the same problem.I will be keeping it for now, since the 19"" they sell locally here aren't that great either. :( The good thing is though, it has a 3 year warranty."
2,Where is the old Denise Mina?????,"""Field of Blood"" moves slowly and the characters are flat, lacking the true-to-life punch and grit of Garnethill, Exile and Resolution. I gave up at page 140 and dove into a Val McDermid. I found myself so bored and daydreaming throughout, that I just decided to cut my loses and stop reading it altogether. What happened to Ms. Mina's writing? The Garnethill trilogy was so fantastic, so what gives now?"
3,"Good, but not great","I'd not read Mina before. She has created a wonderful character in ""Paddy,"" who, in spite of her repressive upbringing and poor self-image, is smart, ambitious and determined. The story does have good suspense, but not until late in the story. The story of the real Paddy was interesting but I think the book would have been tighter and better without it. The book is good, but could have been much better."
4,Mask & Mirror,This is a great album. I enjoy her style and voice. She is a classic and should be considered a Celtic Deva.
1,this is not sixto diaz rodriguez,"this is an information for anyone interested in the early 70's legend rodriguez: please note that ""swing like a metronome"" is NOT by sugar man rodriguez who wrote ""cold fact"" and ""after the fact"". this other guys music is completely different. unfortunately i was fooled by this mistake as well."
2,works for 15 minutes,"the bad thing is that this item shuts off unexpectedly after 30-40 minutes, and you have to wait for several minutes until plugging it in again. the good thing is that it naturally restricts kids from watching the DVD for too long."
3,Works most of the time.,I bought this to replace a lost power adapter for my Colby DVD player. The only problem I have had is the fuse has blown twice. I have been using it for over a month and after replacing the fuse the last time it seems to work fine.
1,NO Charge,the device did not charge my Coby Tablet.please verify with the company on how tomake sure the item works with the coby tablet.
1,car converter,"the first day I used it, it was attached to a basic tape player and it blew up, therefore it is worthless"
1,Save your money,"I bought 3 DVD players, 3 of these in December. Looks great but doesn't work blown fuses, shoddy construction, voltage can be easily changed by accident."
5,Great Item!!!,"Very nice item!!! Tried several other different brands before finding and ordering this one, and lets just say I am glad I had warranty coverage on my Coby Kyros Internet Tablet because the ""other"" brands were crap!One brand straight up fried my battery and it WAS on the ""correct"" settings when this happened. Needless to say they cost 3X the amount of this Coby brand one!! Works Great, fast shipping, has the CORRECT voltage and polarity settings for the Coby Kyros 7005 and the 7015 which is the one I purchased this item for. I would recommend this product to anyone!!"
4,DC Power Cord By Coby,I purchased this item for a DVD Player for my car. It was advertised to have various tips so it would fit most any component and also had voltage settings. Some of the reviews talk about blowing fuses and would not work. Well the reason for the problems is the tip has to be installed properly. If it is installed backward it creates a direct ground. That blows a fuse. The center pin has to be positive and the outside has to be negative. It is not marked so I used a volt meter to assure which was which. It works great.
1,Didn't work,I bought this to use with my son's portable dvd player for a family trip we were taking. When the batteries died on the dvd player I went to go plug it in and it didn't work.
3,okay car adapter,"So, I am not a big fan of having all the universal plugs that easily unplug. My 3 year unplugged it from the adapter a couple of times and then it was loose and kept falling out. Each time it fell out, whether we be in the airport, on the airplane or the car comes with a loud scream and I scramble to the floor looking for the adapter piece. Eventually I taped it all together to the deck. I wish I didn't have to do that."
3,Cute,"If you are expecting a great book, don't disappoint yourself by reading THE PRINCESS TEST. Read DAVE AT NIGHT or ELLA ENCHANTED instead, because while it's cute and witty to a point, THE PRINCESS TEST is nothing like the other two. The plot is well put together but frustratingly simple; the characters are the same. I like the fairy tale style, but Ms. Levine's attempts at childish humor are only mildly amusing. It could be a spirited I-Can-Read book, and a new reader might actually enjoy the predictability and familiarity of the storyline, but if you're past that stage, don't expect anything further than a pleasant, sleepy twenty minutes with this book."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I couldn't wait to see this movie,I kept seeing previews for it and it looked good.Then I rented it and was very disapointed.First off I was REALLY confused during the whole movie.The acting was not good at all and I love Winona,but not in this movie.Finally,WHO WROTE THIS MOVIE????It is absolutly the worst movie I have ever seen.AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Huh?,"I was very confused while watching the beginning of Lost Souls. I hate it when I have to ask the people I am watching a movie with to explain what is going on. I found myself wanting to turn off Lost Souls after the first 15 minutes but decided to hang in.The middle of the movie cleared things up for me, and I actually became intrigued for a short time. Winona Ryder was good, but not good enough to hold up this hokey film.The ending just made me realize I had wasted my time with this movie. I had more fun observing my parrot playing with his new toy and often had to rewind due to missing dialog. Thankfully enough, I got it for free from my old job.I am not going to write about the plot, as you can read the other reviews to learn about Lost Souls. Just wanted to give my overall thoughts about it. I give it two stars because the acting was OK and the Mai Tai's we drank while watching it were strong. Aw yeah."
2,"If you saw the trailer, you saw the scariest scenes.","This film, although it had its creepy moments, is a waste of time. Based on an over-used, apocolyptic premise, the film relies too heavily on visual effects rather than story-telling, resulting in a visually-stunning, yet disappointingly unclimactic finished product. Several times during the course of the film, I found myself wondering when something significant was going to occur, and more importantly, when is this movie going to end? And the surprise ending wasn't such a surprise.The only thing the film had going for it was Winona Ryder, who gives a typical haunting performance as an ex-possessee. (Is that a word?) When she meets a young man whom she believes will become the anti-Christ, they try to figure out a way to prevent it from happening.Don't waste your time on this one. The trailer makes it seem much more interesting than it actually is."
1,Waste of 2 Hours!,I thought the movie was just awful! Bad story and bad acting! Don't waste your time and energy!
1,her last decade,"hopefully this is her last album! this album is a load of hogwashed! she sounds terrible is one thing, the fact that she can't sing at alL!"
3,Could be better,Was not to impressed with this book and it needs to be up to date I think this book was written for the 80's info was real basic and thinks that I already knew.
3,Johnny Thunders - 'New Too Much Junkie Business' (Roir),"Originally released in late 1982. Basically, a fourteen track compilation of the late great punk guitarist and songwriter's semi-lengthy repertoire. Tunes here I dug the most were ""Who Do Voodoo"", the catchy ""Just Another Girl"", ""So Alone"" and ""Let Go"" (co-written by fellow New York Dolls member / drummer Jerry Nolan). Also sort of liked their ""Who Needs Girls?"" - which is an uncanny resemblance to Booker T. & The MG's ""Green Onions"". Not a bad pick."
5,Great product,"This replaced a unit I kept in my car for many years. Wow, such an improvement. Love the quality and speed at which this performs. Can't be beat for the price! Very satisfied."
2,Don't buy it!,"I bought it on February 27, 2008. The air compressor was in use every 2 weeks to pump my car tires. I maintained it according to Owner's Manual. Yesterday, December 14, 2010, the compressor stopped to work properly. The motor works but air doesn't come out. This thing has US patent and it made in China. So, parts quality is weak. I'll never buy it again."
3,"Some good, some bad, but it worked for my class","Lacking on the ""international"" factor most cases are USA relating to the rest of the world, with a few notably good exceptions.In general not so well written, but again with a few notable exceptions of great case studies.Bottom line: there are not many books on this subject so this one flies until something better shows up."
1,Not Impressed At All,The scenes and music in this CD are very(very) depressing. I thought it would be kind of a light pitter patter of rain with abackground of classical music. I was so wrong. I got this aroundChristmas time which sometimes can be very depressing for someand this one just increased my melancholy.
2,My friend has one...,"I don't have one of these, but my friend does. he bought this nearly two years ago at Best Buy. They kept trying to sell him a warranty for it, even offering it for free, which was a little odd (but I guess maybe cause so many people have said it breaks on them). It was $120 something, which is way too much to pay for it now. It's a simple mp3 player, no screen , just play, pause, stop, rewind, forward. I thought it'd be hard to use since you can't see which song you have playing, but it only holds about 30 songs so it's not that hard. It's like the ipod shuffle in a way. Well I've read all these terrible reviews about it and I just have to say that it isn't all terrible. I guess some are crappy, but my friend got one of the good ones. It's never broken on him and it's sound quality is good. It's worked well for him, but I mean, all these reviews don't make it sound good.Best to look for another player, just to be safe."
3,"In response to William Polm ""bill197""","In response to the comment by William Polm ""bill197"" in regards to turning the player on : Your player is not necessarily broken. You turn it on by HOLDING DOWN the play button for several seconds. You will notice the LCD screen light up, and a progress bar will come up. It will increase quickly in 1/4 increments across the bar until the player is on, and it will immediately begin playing.You will also need to HOLD DOWN the button to turn the player off."
5,Wow,This was definately a page turner and kept me in suspense. I usually credit myself for being able to predict what will happen next in a story; however this book kept me guessing. I absolutely loved it!
4,Near perfection!,"I became a fan of Bic Runga with her last CD. I thought her lyrics were fantastical and really clever and romantic. This new CD is much more mature sounding. It is a bit darker and seems to steal and mix things from a variety of genre here and there, but at the core is Bic. She has very catchy melancholy melodies and a richness in her guitars and all the instrumentation. Liked it better than her last. Would have given it 5 stars, but I always think it's not completely accurate as it seems skewed. Could it be 4 and a half?"
4,Really sharp,"Just received this knife and thank goodness, it is really sharp.I'm left-handed and not sure if it's actually designed for ussouthpaws. One thing that surprised me is that the knife is ratherheavy. I'm used to using a Kyocera ceramic blade knife with a plasic handle and this is so much heavier. Slicees and chops very well."
1,Too much lint,"Yes it is soft but leaves a ton of lint. If you would like to try it, just buy one roll and do the mirror test. Wet one square, put it on the mirror and then remove it. You can see how much lint comes off."
1,loosely-connected pieces of lint,"This stuff is horrible. It tears if you look at it crooked. Forget tearing off a square or two to, say, wipe off lipstick dab at a cut you got while shaving. All it will do for you is leave lint all over the place--that is, if you can tear it off without tearing it apart."
1,Save your $6,"I have an 5 year old laptop without a DVI output like my new one does. So thought I would purchase the adaptor to be able to hook to my HDTV through a DVI to HDMI cable. My laptop did not recognize the adaptor and just shut down on me. I tryed everything to fix, but nothing worked."
2,IReal,"It holds DVDs successfully. But the doors sag and have to be lifted when opening and closing the doors. The bottom broke off while moving it. And the lock doesn't work. I bought 2, they are both the same."
4,"Overall, I'm very satisfied","I bought this cabinet about 3.5yrs ago. the doors are completely filled with CDs and the back wall is filled with a combination of vhs/dvd/cd.yes, the cds are a bit heavy, but not to the point where it weighs down the doors and they are difficult to close.For the price, i give it 4 stars.It looks very nice in my apartment living room.The one thing i did have to do was put an old thin paperback book under the side that is next to the wall so that the cabinet would be level. this isn't because of the design of the cabinet, it's crappy carpet.Iother than that, I'm very satisfied."
2,Ehh,I thought that this would be a funny book to just read on about but really I haven't used it once. And I find that some of it isn't really correct (if that makes any sense). Overall I'd just save your money and not bother with it.
4,law school insider-worth the money,"I think this book was excellent and very useful. Horowitz' honesty was very useful, and he tempered it with comparison to his peers. His style might not be as slick as some people prefer, but I found his book to be very useful. His website is also a great plus."
3,granddaughter likes it,"This was a Christmas present for my 4 year old granddaughter who also has 2 sisters. So, it is expected to delight 3 girls. Although there were endless parts to put together and it doesn't fold flat to go under her bed as I thought it would, she thinks it is ""beautiful"" and loves it."
4,Very good candy but -,"I had this candy in my cart but once I saw shipping would've costed more than the candy, I deleted it."
3,"Fun, but not true!","This is a fun book, but it is not history. Do a Web search for ""crapper"" at snopes.com or in the wikipedia for discussion."
2,Lousy fights doom The Bodyguard,"The Bodyguard stars Sonny Chiba as . . . Sonny Chiba. He wants to take down the drug trade and to that end offers to be the bodyguard to anyone who needs it. A woman shows up asking for his services but she is not forthcoming as to why. She does however have a lot of people after her as Sonny finds out. It eventually comes out that she was the mistress of a mob boss that was gunned down at the start of the movie and she still has his last shipment of drugs and wants to sell them for a half million dollars.The Bodyguard is dull and confusing. How being someone's bodyguard is going to bring down the drug trade is never explained. The worst sin for a martial arts film is the fights were lousy. Weird camera angles and quick edits made it so you never could tell what was going on. Whatever Sonny Chiba's skills are, they were not showcased in this movie."
1,Grease angle,"No good... Returning it.. It says ""Works with all grease guns"" but it did not work at all with mine. And my grease gun is a standard auto parts store grease gun."
4,Satan Rocks!,Draw a circle on the floor and sit in it. Conjure a mixture of the vocal stylings of Cradle Of Filth with the songwriting style of King Diamond and Venom and throw in some interesting instruments other than guitars and keyboards and you have a very heavy black metal album from the UK and not Norway for a change. Akercocke sound a lot like other black metal bands but their packaging is different as well as their wardrobe. A cool booklet with the lyrics is packed with some unique photos. Grab your favorite virgin and sit under a full moon and hail the Goat! (Be sure to wear your Sunday best.)
5,LOVING IT - GREAT ALBUM / CD - MUST HAVE !,"IF YOU ARE A FAN OF JAZZ AND JAZZ FUSION , YOU SHOULD BUY THIS CD . I HAVE FOLLOWED THE CARRERS OF BOTH MUSICIANS AND THEY KNOW HOW TO CREATE AND BRING A LOT OF JOY TO THE EARS . I ALSO OWN THE LP RECORD ALBUM . YOU WON'T BE SORRY !"
3,Five Stars For Performance-2 Stars For Packaging=3 Stars,"It is so infuriating when you see a package like this ! Tons of classic tracks , many available on other collections , many not. You peruse the track listing and find 74 tracks on FOUR discs. You remember the songs--most barely cracking the 3 minute mark. FOUR discs? Yeah , you guessed it , it could have all fit on THREE (with plenty of room to spare). AAARRRGGGHHH!!!!You buy it anyway , because the music is that good. You're overjoyed with the songs when you hear them in pristine digital sound , but you never get over being ripped off by a record label.So five stars for performance minus 2 stars for packaging equals three stars !"
2,Albert Brooks is funnier in Movies,Not really funny. I wanted to like this album bad but it's just not timeless like steve martin. not worth the money
3,Just OK,The carriage is fine but the horse does not stand up very well (my 4 year old gets frustrated)and the bridle is always coming undone. There is plenty of room for all her princesses and she enjoys taking them to the ball in the carriage -so it's just OK.
2,Cheaply made without children in mind,"I was fairly disapppointed in this product. Perhaps it was aggravation after taking 6 Barbies and a vanity out of the packaging... perhaps because this carriage is not very child friendly. My daughter received this as a gift and is 4 years old. She becomes very frustrated because the horse rarely stay upright and the carriage is difficult to convert without adult help. In addition, some of the ""Dancing Princesses"" don't have bendable legs, making it challenging to get them to all fit in correctly."
1,Lasted all of about 4 hours.,"This tube lasted all of about 4 hours for me. Who ever assembled this amp board at the factory didnt tighten the heat sinks down,or they rattled lose. this caused a avalanche of part failures on the amp circut board. The tube did sound fine while it lasted, but a little lock tight would have gone a long way in securing the heat sinks on the amp board.I guess I will see how good the Pyle warrenty is."
2,Not worth it for the money,"I have to agree with the other reviews that state that the Glamourmom nursing tank top does not have enough support, at least for large breasted women. The straps are fabric and have stretched out quite a bit, and was noticeable after the first time I wore it! I found that the Bravado nursing tank top offered much more support and the straps did not stretch out as they were more like conventional bra straps. The one great thing about the Glamourmom tank top is that it is LONG and the Bravado one is quite short and does not help in masking the post-natal belly!"
1,"Quality control issues, bad customer service","I ordered 3 Glamourmom tanks 08/28/07. By December, the stitching came off the clasp, leaving the tank unusable. I wrote to Glamourmom 01/06/08 and received instructions on how to return it for a replacement. The replacement arrived a few weeks later. By March, the stitching came off the bottom hem of another tank, and again I returned it for a replacement. Despite contacting Glamourmom on more than one occasion, I have still not received a replacement, one year after it failed. They claim they have no record of the second tank and refuse to assist me in getting it replaced. I certainly won't recommend them to anyone!"
4,Plus size please,"I am a curvy woman (size 14/16) and thought this top was a fabulous idea!! Unfortunately, I need one size larger than X-Large while nursing. I would highly recommend making this top in plus sizes, as well. I would buy more than one if so.My suggestion to the company is to keep working on it and make more sizes. My review for everyone under my size is that this is an awesome top!!"
1,A biassed report,"Every historian knows how unreliable witnesses can be when there's politics, ideology and religion involved. Especially when the near entourage is made up by Armenian translators and secretaries..."
1,Cannot download.,"Very frustrating. I kept getting the message that it was missing something in the downloading of the book. I never read it, although wish I could have downloaded it. Left me frustrated!"
2,DIDN'T HELP ME,"I ordered this item because others said it helped as much or even more than the leg cramp tablets. However, rub as I would, I could get no relief from the cream. I wouldn't say I hated it (one star), but I really didn't like it. The smell is also a turn off (smells like Ben-Gay), but it doesn't seem to linger too long."
5,Hyland's Leg Cramp Ointment,"My Mother-in-law loves this product. Comes three tubes to an order, and she recently asked me to place another order before she runs out."
4,cute book,I bought this to use in my kindergarten at the end of the year. I know my class will enjoy it.
3,Not bad but disappointing in many ways.,This book is useful because it provides patterns for so many of the 16 to 18 inch fashion dolls and discusses variations in their figures. However the greatest shortcoming is that the folder does not include all the patterns shown in the book and additional patterns need to be ordered. I have not established that the additional patterns are still available but in any case shipping them to Australia will undoubtedly be costly - far more costly than a book from Amazon!The patterns provided are straight forward and fairly simple. Presumably the additional patterns are the more complicated ones that will appeal to fewer readers.This is probably a good starting volume for fashion doll collectors wanting to personalise their dolls or create clothes in fabrics leftover from their own garments.
4,It's a Power Block Folks,"Essentially, it's a power cord for a child's educational gaming system. It's not Monster Cable quality and, unless i'm entirely mistaken, it seems as though it was never meant to be. It works none the less. The system boots, the games play, etc. For all intents and purposes, I can't find any difference between this adapter and the one that came in the v.smile box."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this adapter to save myself from having to buy C batteries to keep my kids v.smile going. I wish I had just stuck with the batteries, they really do last for quite a while. This adapter doesn't seem to fit snugly enough into the v.smile system. My daughter is constantly coming to tell me her v.smile won't turn on. The solution? Jiggling the adapter into the back of the v.smile. For 9.99 I shouldn't have to jiggle the plug every 10 mintues!"
4,Found it at Target,"I purchased this yesterday at Target for 9.99, and they had about 10 on the shelf. I see Toys-R-Us has lowered the price to 11.99, so they seem to be moving in the right direction.It works so far, fingers are crossed that I don't have the problems the lady who had bought two had."
3,Opinion,This product is no easy to find in most web sites. Thanks to Amazon I could find it.Good Product.Thansk Amazon.
4,Bought ten if these for me and my classmates!!,"Gave it 4 stars, because they are the older nandas, but this is super easy to use...I bought enough for all my classmates and we all succeeded!!!"
2,Buy the Application to Clinical Practice Instead,"While this is a great REFERENCE book, I would advise all nursing student or even practicing RN's to use Carpenito's complete book titled: Nursing Diagnosis: Application to Clinical Practice. This non-handbook version is much more comprehensive by displaying usages for each diagnosis and common errors in diagnosing. The handbook is convient but too brief on nursing diagnosis usage. Spend the extra $10 and get Carpenito's complete book. It will save you a lot of time writing those care plans:-(. The 8th ed. should be published by 10/99."
5,Def Jam Vendetta,"this game is crazy fun. the intense urban street fighting combines the realism or Deadly Alliance, with the arcade fun No Mercy. an excellent buy. plus original soundtracks from DMX (X gonna give it to ya) and other artists. this is one title that is worth your lunch money."
5,THEY DONE STARTED SOMTHING!!!,"""DEF JAM VENDETTA"" IS THE ILLEST HIP-HOP GAME ON THE MARKET IN THE 2K3! THE GRAPHICS, THE VOICE OVERS, THE STORYLINE, THE MOVES AND THE SOUNDTRACK ARE HOT! I THINK THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA OF VIDEO GAMES! IF YOU LOVE HIP-HOP MUSIC & CULTURE & YOU LOVE FIGHTING VIDEO GAMES, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME RENTING IT, COP IT QUICK, YA HEARD!"
1,Poor facts.,"This book twists facts around to make them interesting and dramatic. Definitely not a history book nor even a realistic novel, this book can be considered tabloid-esque. Please don't buy this book, it's pretty blatant in its effort to appear startling and intense."
5,Bill Gertz has my respect; well documented non-propaganda,"Much of what i have read in this book is well documented, and verifiable through other sources. I had heard previously about many of these stories, but not all of them. Gertz puts it all in one convenient location. People who slam this as propaganda (forgive my grammar) don't know ""spin"" when they are sitting on it.This book is an easy read, a slow start, but gets more interesting in the middle, and best near the end. The appendix is very useful for fans of foreign policy and intelligence works. I recommend it highly.I have also heard Bill Gertz speak on the radio, and generally consider him a more reliable and intelligent source than most media folks. Take that how you like it. The real problem with this book isn't the messenger, its the message! China is the 800lb gorilla, and Gertz makes it very clear we don't take them as a serious threat."
3,PS Micro Wheel,I bought this for my 6years old son - it serve his need except that the rubber stopper don't stick too well.
4,Good quality. Decent sound. Easy install.,"These Pyle speakers are great for the price. I paid less than $40/pair. They are of good heavy construction and were easy to install. The sound quality is not what you would find in a more expensive speaker, but they are more than efficient and sound just fine while floating & crusing on the water!"
2,poor quality,"Purchased these for our boat (as they are marine speakers) the quality of these speakers are horrible. Would not recommend to waste your money, unless you dont mind constant static...."
5,Breaking the silence through shared stories and insights,"These are five voices that speak against the silence and begin to fill the void in American culture of authentic Asian American women who share the stories of how their faith, ethnicity, and gender interact and have shaped their lives in both painful and wondrous ways. For those of us who may think we know the stories and the issues, this book will surprise and challenge us - never will we look at a paper crane the same way again!"
4,Interesting look at France,"The quality of the recording and production is very good. The show has a tour-like quality and shows important sites and monuments in France and briefly mentions the history behind them. The chefs are obviously quite skilled. The main complaint I had was the number of errors the narrator makes. This woman clearly is not a cook. She frequently identifies ingredients incorrectly. If you are watching the film you see her repeatedly confuse chives and shallots, call ""slicing"" ""chopping"", etc. In one case, she points out the chef is adding onions and ginger to the pan, then next says he's adding garlic when it is clearly lemongrass that is being added. Major steps are missing in the baking recipes. It is rather annoying. You can not learn much about cooking from this film. It is much better as a tourist show.Still, it's fun to watch if that is what you are looking for."
1,"After 1 season, it died","It worked fine for one season, then it died. Fan works, hot air comes out but it does not draw any moisture / water into the tank. Now I realize that Maytag is a washing machine company who does not know how to make dehumidifiers. What a mistake!"
1,Disappointed,I feel like I was decieved. I was trying to order the 6th edition of this book and that's what it looked like I was ordering. When I recieved the book it was the first edition from about 1984. This book is for one of my college courses and because it is so old I can't use any of the information in it. I had to order a more recent edition and now I'm waiting on that to arrive while I'm falling behind in my assignments.
5,This is REAL LIFE stuff!,"We are using this little book this week to train our 887 employees in HOW to give our customers great, memorable service in the very competitive trucking industry. We have more competitors than ever before and the ideas Chuck Clowdis gives in his book will differentiate use from the mediocre! Thanks for the skill and experiemce so expertly, but simply, given in this text!Roger Enright"
1,Breville BBL600XL Ikon 750-Watt 51-Ounce Blender,"This review is for the people who will buy for the first time from this seller. I bought 2 of this blenders (not from this seller) I bought it from Amazon llc and got amazing service, delivered incredible fast and at incredible price of $50.00 dlls. Buy my first one for a wedding gift and can't hold to buy another for myself. I saw this refurbished blender for $31.99. dlls with this seller ""BigKitchen"" and I order 2 more for my kids. My order was on 6/8/12 and on 6/13/12 I got a mail from them telling that they had some items incorrectly priced and they were unable to fulfill my order. Yes, was amazing price for the item, but because I buy it before for $50.(refurbished and looking exactly like brand new) was not unreasonably like they tell me on their mail, because was refurbished too.Really, I will never look again at their ""deals"" for them frustrate me not sending the item. Deals at this store are not believable anymore."
3,Defective bearing,"The bearing in the blade assembly seized on the shaft and caused the blender to overheat due to the excessive load. Smoke poured from the blender before it could be shut down. Upon disassembly of the blade unit, it was observed that moisture had entered the bearing area even though a rubber seal was present. For some reason, Breville chose to utilize an unsealed bearing thereby inviting disaster. This blender is nineteen months old and is used primarily to make smoothies. The design of the blade assembly with regard to moisture rejection is suspect. I would not buy another Breville blender for this reason.Breville sent a replacement blade and bearing assembly which supposedly was an upgrade. A new jar was sent as well since the new design required a different jar. However, what I received as a replacement was identical to the old parts. So far, Beville has not responded to my request for clarification."
2,Design Flaw,"Fantastic blender, but it has one huge problem. It leaks. On the Breville website, they call it a ""design flaw."" So fix it!!!"
1,NEVER BUY THIS BLENDER,"This blender has been a pain in the ass from the start, but i liked the look so much that i stuck with it until today, when i used the 'puree' setting for the first time and it pureed the rubber gasket below the blades RIGHT INTO MY 2 HOUR ORGANIC SOUP.THANKS BREVILLE for an organic lentil and RUBBER soup. UGH. Hey, at least the disgusting burning smell coupled with their horrible 'limited 1 year warranty' makes me so nauseated that I'm no longer hungry."
5,Better than advertised!,"This blender is better than advertised. I researched many blenders all over the net and this blender beats them all hands down. I highly recommend this blender. Great job, Breville!"
2,"Great for awhile, then kaput!","Seal went bad and the motor seized afgter about 13 months of use. Burnt rubber smell, and that was it. I tried to contact Breville, but nothing except lots of time on hold."
2,Faulty design,"We have had the same issue as a few reviewers & also will never buy another Breville product. We only used it for making smoothies & stopped doing that, when it kept turning itself off after a few seconds on the purée mode. When it started smoking & caused one of smoothies to taste like burned rubber...we called Breville. They responded by sending us a new glass jar set, which although a nice gesture, does us no good, since the motor is worthless. The irony here is that my parents AND my in-laws, BOTH still have the Oster blenders they received as wedding gifts (over 50 years ago) & they still work! If Breville can't stand behind their product, with a design flaw they know exists, then NO ONE should be spending $200 on one. We now have a Blendtec at home & absolutely love it."
2,Very good - until it started to get rusted,"I moved into a city by the ocean and after a few months my blender was full of rust.....other than that, excellent."
1,Blade Assembly Did Not Last Long,"My Breville had about 15 blends before it went bad. It never leaked, but it's always been very difficult to attach the blade assembly to the base and after the 15th blend, the black rubber thing that the blade assembly fits into, started to deteriorate. Talk about burning rubber! It's just a matter of time now before it's totally useless.EDIT 11/9/10I've written to Breville about the blade assembly going bad and they sent me a new one, however, it did not fit. I wrote back and they said I have the older version and are sending me a new glass container also; all at no charge. I am very impressed since I've had the blender for about 7 years. I'll update after I receive the new parts and have made a bunch of smoothies."
1,Blender DOA- I was warned but I did not listen,"The blender is DOA after two lite uses so we're returning it to Amazon. I read the other reviews but thought the blender had been improved, WRONG! We have two other Breville products, the tea maker and the convection oven and both are good products, but the blender is an over priced flawed product. It is made in China so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. This replaced an old Oster that never failed so we are going back to a $39 Oster and I bet it will be far more reliable than this terrible product. Wake up Breville-you must know by now this is a bad product-but greed trumps integrity I guess."
1,never again,"I purchased a refurbished blender from abes of maine,it stopped working after 2 weeks and 3 uses.no one wants to take responsibility to help to get it to work again.This was agreat lesson for me. NEVER!!! buy anything that might need service online. i'm headed back to my local retailer to do business face to face no more dreary phone call waits it is not worth the stress"
2,Cutting corners in quality,"I've had this blender for a couple of years now. When it's new, it's impressive. Looks solid, nice design, glass and steel.Here's the problem:1) If it isn't cranked tight, it leaks. Everywhere. Some people will not be strong enough to crank it tight enough.2) After two years, the 'stainless steel' is flaking off in large amounts.Companies like Breville that have a retail price around $200 for a blender need to make sure their Chinese supply chain isn't cutting corners, which obviously theirs is. Breville can't keep charging Grade A prices for cheap junk from grade C factories. I suspect the rest of their gear is likely of the same quality.Do yourself a favor. Invest in a Kitchenaid http://www.amazon.ca/KitchenAid-KSB565OB-5-Speed-Blender-Glass/dp/B002R59ZQ6 or similar quality unit and look forward to handing it down to your kids 20 years later.Now I have to go buy a new blender. Grumble..."
2,"Pretty, but Unreliable","I just repackaged my second Ikon 600XL. I'm taking it back. It doesn't work reliably. Sometimes it works great. Other times it would not turn off unless I pulled the plug from the wall. The second one had a strange habit of pulsing everything, so there was no ""constant on"" for any of the settings. One other thing: this baby is XL tall. My cabinets are higher off the counter than in most kitchens, so check your clearance before buying this blender.I liked the glass container, the style, and the small footprint. The buttons sure were pretty. It looked as good on my counter as my KitchenAid mixer, too. But, what good is pretty when it doesn't work properly?"
1,"AVOID - Leaking, display broken, smells after 2 weeks","The blender LOOKS great but...it started leaking after the 3rd use. I figured it must be ""user error"". Read the instructions, assembled everything by the book. But it happened the 4th, 6th, 8th, etc. time too. It just does not seal.Then the digital display stopped working. I'm guessing due to constantly leaking and getting moisture in the components.And it has started to smell. Even though I disassemble and clean the entire thing, it seems like liquids get stuck somewhere you can't get to and it's starting to smell.A big disappointment from Breville. I actually have every other Breville appliance (juicer, coffee grinder, coffee maker, kettle) and am happy with them.But I would NOT recommend this belnder! Even my old cheap Cuisinart is much better than this!"
1,Breville BBL 600XL Blender not recommended,Received this as a gift less than two years ago and it stopped working after no more than 12 uses. Received little help from Breville customer support as it is out of warranty. They provided a list of authorized out-of-warranty service providers...closest one is 200 miles away. I expected more for $250 and something purchased from Williams-Sonoma.
3,Worked well for 6 months then blades gave out - beware,"We purchased this item about 6 - 8 months ago and were very pleased with the performance and low noise level. It did great creating smoothies and soups, which is the reason it was purchased. The motor was powerful and quiet. After each use the jar was washed out and placed on the drainer to air dry.Recently I noticed a rougher sound when using it so I began investigating the blade assembly. I found that it had deteriorated badly and I had small gritty pieces of metal all over the motor base after I removed the glass jar assembly. It is apparent the manufacturer doesn't use stainless steel parts for the blade assembly and the shaft for the blade assembly has just basically crumbled.I have spent three hours trying to find a replacement part and they are no longer available. I could get a new jar assembly but it would cost 2/3 the original cost. I guess you get what you pay for these days."
1,$200 into the trash,"I can only echo what other 1-star reviewers have said. I purchased this based upon a Consumer Reports very positive review. It worked great for a while, then the grinding motor and the burning smell began. It became unusable, shortly after the warranty expired, of course. Expensive mistake."
4,Brothers and Keeps,"What a poignant,powerful book about the choices we are offered within our lives. I, too, have a younger brother that ""did time"" for a crime and can share many of the thoughts that were raised in this book. The only difference is is that I am a white female, whose brother is 9 yrs younger, and that I had to wait until age 40 to financially be able to realize my dream of an education. A frank, powerful book!"
2,Guilt is an obnoxious feeling to have when reading.,"Brothers and Keepers, in the beginning, was an interesting piece of work, about a man who makes his way to the top in a racist and oppressive society. But as I read on, I began to form the impression that I should be feeling bad about who I am (a Caucasian woman from Minnesota with everything *apparently* handed to me on a golden platter.) To tell you the truth, I found the book quite offensive. I am sick and tired of having to feel bad for every Tom Dick and Harry African American who has had something bad happen in his/her life and who wishes to use white people as the scapegoat. The book would have been more impressive if he would have stuck to the storyline and gotten further away from who should feel evil and who is to blame."
4,Don't leave home without it!,"I have had 3 of these baby's over the last few years and love it. I carry it everywhere. Before I leave on a trip I transfer tons of notes about the area, directions, hotel confirmations, restaurants, etc. from websites to the Rex. I have all my phone numbers and addresses with me all the time because it is so small. My ""keeper"" copies of my files are on my PC at home so even if something happens to my REX I have lost NOTHING!"
5,Great Book On the glory days Of Powerboats.,"Nice Book,Some History and pics, about American Powerboats, Its glory days, Pre-Fiberglass Stuff, Small Hardcover.Focus heavy on The Great Lakes As The Title implies. Covers couple Run-a-bouts, Dodge.(yes dodge, and their story)Hackercraft,Chris Craft,A Packard Powered Beast of A Boat as well, Races between Americans And British Racers. My first book on the subject and I want to get more. Thanks for the good book."
4,color other than black,"We love the phone, we had one before. I'm looking for the model 930 w/caller ID, but not in black. we are looking for the ivory or cream colored one. can u help?"
5,Walking with Monsters,This BBC series covers life -before- the Age of Dinosaurs. As such we get to see all sorts of critters. Very good graphics bring these monsters to life. This is a neat series.
4,Amarna revisited,"Nicholas Reeves' latest book, Akhenaten is a convincing re-assessment of the 17 year reign of Egypt's heretic king. Drawing on recent discoveries and the re-examination of previous finds, to shed more light on this most controversial period of Egyptian history. Especially convincing were his arguments on the true identity of the mummy found in KV55, and the evidence pointing to Akhenaten's co-regency with Queen Nefertiti as Smenkhare. What I did find distressing and curious was Mr. Reeves' obvious distaste and criticism for Queen/King Hatshepsut. I do still recommend this book highly. An important work on a very important time in history."
4,mono me,"I've been using this Manfrotto 679B monopod for about three months and it is great! It is durable,fast,and light.It also doubles as a walking stick.To increase it's utility by a considerable amount be sure to get a swival head for the top of the pod, this will allow you to move the camera along the four axis (E,W,N,S)as well as go horizontal or vertical with the camera. I took my swival head off my tripod and use it on the mono pod works great.This is an essential product if you like sharp images, or If you use a polarizer and or a tele lens."
3,"Fantastic Cleaner, Sealer is meh ...",The top looked better than new with just the cleaner. The protector spray nozzle produces too fine of a mist. I tried over 3 days and the slightest breeze will blow it everywhere. Despite my efforts to cover the car around the top the wind blew it on the paint and windows. Its very difficult to clean off. Fortunately it seemed to last about 6 months with 1 coat. Unfortunately it wore off the top too. But for a while the top looked awesome. I will give it 2 coats this spring to see how log it last.
4,"Too hot to handle, but otherwise great.","This is an attractive set which cooks very well and cleans up easily afterward. The construction is extremely solid and the heating is fairly even, but not as even as more expensive all-clad or chantal cookware. The major negative for this set is that the lid handles get dangerously hot during cooking so a hotpad is necessary, but this is not true of the pot handles which always stay cool. All in all, this is a very nice set for the price and I recommend it, but definitely watch your hands on the lid."
2,sticks every time,how can I keep these pots & pans from sticking when in use? I spray with cooking spary and they stick horrible.
3,"In response to ""Scientific observation...""","For what it's worth, we had an aluminum pot that completely melted when the water boiled out (although we never thought to sue...sheesh!). It's entirely possible, and something I keep in mind to this day when dealing with aluminum on the stove. The melting point of various metals changes dramatically when alloyed with other metals. It's not a stretch to assume that an alloy is used by All-Clad, and that the alloy has a low melting point.Just thought I'd add more information to the issue..."
1,EVERYTHING sticks to these pans!!!!,"I'm an experienced cook so I can assure you I'm using low heat and various things like butter, Pam, and olive oil to keep the pan lubricated. I've made everything from hotdogs and scrambled eggs to mexican pizza and french food. EVERYTHING sticks to these pans! It's frustrating and unbelievable. My crappy old T-Fal pans work better than this. Good thing I kept them on hand because I'm going to use those instead."
5,Easy read on a challenging subject,"This book is a very easy read for even those who are non-scientists but are interested in the history of science. This book focuses mostly on cosmology and particle physics and the attempts made by scientists to unite the two areas with one theory ... the Theory of Everything.Right now the two biggest theories in physics are Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, which deals with gravity and big things (i.e: galaxies and stars), and the Quantum Theory, which deals with small things (i.e: atoms and quarks). The poblem is that the two of them don't mesh, they don't play well together.Falk's book is an overview of the history leading to these two discoveries, and the search for a theory that will explain these two theories in one framework.Very easy read, very informative, highly recommended."
1,Where Was the Editor?,"Do not buy this book! There are so many typographical errors that it distracts from Stevenson's wonderful tale. The only good thing about this edition is the cover art which is true to Stevenson's description of the bottle. If only a proofreader had done his job, it would have rated five stars for, of course, Robert Louis Stevenson wrote a five star story."
2,There's a better one,"I find this reference book a little disappointing. While not a bad book, it's not comprehensive enough and explanations are (in many cases) too concise. If you don't already know the meaning of the term you're looking up, chances are you won't understand it after reading the item. I also purchased the Harper Collins Dictionary of Mathematics, and here are the good news - it's much better than the Oxford. Much more comprehensive and more readable. It's not perfect either, but if you're going to have only one of these, I recommend the Harper Collins."
4,"Works great, but the fan is super loud!","This video card is great for the price. It supports 2 monitors and we've had no problems with it in the past year. The only thing is, the fan on it is exceedingly loud. I installed this on my husband's computer, which sits right next to the monitors, so every time I went in his office I wondered what the sound was. But eventually you get used to it. Now I don't even hear it anymore. Like I said, for the price it really does work great."
3,Not as well thought out as his other products,"After buying an induction cooktop, we needed new cookware of magnetic stainless, so bought a set of Emeril's and gave away our old pots. Since we steam a great deal, I bought this to go along with the 3 quart saucepan. Unfortunately, it is as shown, deep but with a smaller flat bottom. This is great for steaming most vegetables, but not so good for asparagus or tamales. For them, we had to keep our older steamer insert for the extra room it affords at the bottom."
2,Why?,"The opening has original music that was Good! When switching disc to disc the song instead of MariMar it was Maria la del Barrio that's a hige ""bubu"". The novela a times didn't make sense. There was good and exciting parts cut as it was when Angelica had her accident on the original version you could see all burned and saying that she didn't regret anything also when Angelica sister lost her baby things that were very interesting. I think this novela was terribly edited as well as boring."
1,A disapointment.,"The company that put this TELenovela on dvd sucks. 3 double sided disc, And for what? I thought I was gonna see more than the television version. They edited lots of scenes and when watching it it does feel like they was trying to rush thrue it. Get it over done with it. What was so hard to add 1more extra disc. DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!"
5,Worth for money...,I'm using this cable with creative spdif i/o and creative audigy 4 sound card and feeding the optical signal in logitech z5500 5.1 speakers optical input. Cable is working fine and its good that i bought this cheap cable instead of other very expensive optical cables.
1,Minature Tripod,"While the product I received had the same product code as the object pictured it did not resemble in any way the tripod shown above. The one I thought I was ordering looked fairly well constructed. The one I received was exceptionally heavy, the leg extensions were absolutely useless (they shifted from their proscribed orientation each time they were extended which then made collapse a frustrating nightmare) and the ball and socket head is either loose (and whatever is attached to it drops immediately to the lowest position possible and usually against a leg) or completely tight (making small adjustments very difficult).I am sorry that this product was so cheaply made....I have already thrown it away."
4,Not bad,"I choose this tripod cause it folds to half the size of the competitors w/o sacrificing much. It's very sturdy. It extends sort of like an antenna, but it takes some muscle. It's especially tough to adjust the height somewhere in-between min and max, but I probably would never need to."
5,This is a great pan !,"My husband and I recently rented a vacation home in Florida. The people had a set of Emerilware pots and pans and I was very impressed with them. I personally have a set of Cuisinart stainless steel cookware which I very much enjoy, but I have to say that I fell in love with the 12"" Emeril frying pan. The weight of it, the ease of cleaning, the handle and the overall quality are wonderful. I am thinking of purchasing one even though I don't need any more pans !!"
1,This is no good.,"A poster of two girls trying to kill each other? What's this teaching the young woman of todays world? And with uzis no less. I think that these girls are pretty, but they don't need the guns to sell a poster. What they need is a garden hose, or a plastic baseball bat, or something way less deadly than a pair of machine guns."
1,Item picture does not match what is purchased.,"The product delivered does not match the image on the Amazon page.Cloud b Baby Sheep with Quiet RattleI just received this item and there is no way that it is the same item! I will be contacting Amazon for a refund. The item that is delivered is a short, 4"" long and 3 1/2"" wide lamb, with 1"" legs and arms. It's head looks straight on and does not bend, so it could not lay the way the picture shows on the site, with it's face looking up if laid on it's belly. This product image should be changed to match what is actually purchased.This item on Amazon is what is delivered instead of the the product shown above -Cloud b Sleep Sheep Four Soothing Sounds From Natureexcept that it only has a rattle in it, not soothing sounds. I think they got the images swapped for these two items."
5,love my camo!,"This has become my favorite seatbelt bag (I own five). This medium tote is the best size for everday use, and the cellphone pocket is the best! The material is super durable and easy to clean (soap and water spot cleaning). Also, the details are great, such as the star zipper-pull and brass hardware. It is a great conversation piece and an all-around fun bag to own."
3,very cool,"I really like this whole series. It seems to be pretty factual in the footage and interviews. Dean Stockwell is pretty good as the host, and the subject matter is great. If you like having TLC, History Channel, or Discover on in the background while doing computer work or whatever, this is the series for you. I've seen some cheesy paranormal/conspiracy video's and this doesn't really rank among them. It's a higher grade of revisionist documentary show than normal (the music is actually great for some reason too)."
4,Great idea but our baby didn't buy it,"We searched long and hard to find the next step from the sink bath tub to the regular bath tub and when we saw this we thought we'd found what we were looking for. Unfortunately, our baby boy didn't buy it. We tried it twice and he just cried. We think it was the ""confinement."" We took him out and just put him in the tub and he was fine. Although we still have to worry about him bumping his head, he's happier. That being said, other babies may take to it and love it. Personally, we think it's a great idea and really wish he would have liked it. The product itself seems to be made well."
1,This tub is a waste of money!,"I have only had this tub for about 3 weeks, and already the material is starting to rip. I have had to hand stitch it so that all of the beads don't fall out. This is only a temporary fix, so I will have to replace this tub eventually. If I had known about this problem originally, I would have purchased something different."
3,Great for a child who can sit up,"Great little invention, it was perfect for a short time(5months to 9months old). Only negative is trying to keep it from mildewing...even if you hang it to dry it still gets that mildew smell"
2,Not a hit at my house,"I thought this insert was a great idea, but it seemed to scare my 10-month old. She cried hysterically the second I put her in it the first time. The second time she cried the entire time despite my taking the time to show it to her and let her touch it, etc, before getting into the tub. same thing on night 3, so I returned it. Granted, this is just our experience, but I will say that I think part of the issue was she couldn't splash in it. As others have said, despite the manufacturers image, this tub doesn't really fill up with water - it pretty much soaks back through to the main tub. Also, I did rinse it off and hang it to dry, and after three uses it already had that 'sour' smell."
5,Great product!,"I use this for my 10 month old twins - they love it. We fill our clawfoot tub half full (which is pretty deep) and this thing floats like a boat. The girls love the gentle motion it makes when floating or when we push them back and forth in the tub. I no longer have to stress about when they might throw themselves backwards and hit their head. I posted a pic of the two of them in the tub. Usually we do one at a time, but squeezed them both in there for the photo."
5,"I am a unorganized, untalented, slop professor","I hope you don't mind the intro. i am really that way. for this review i give it 5 stars because i want to give credit to those who don't inspire children at all. It is only a few brave souls that don't want to speak/sing to young children and not be accused about giving the wrong message. most people would try to voice there opion and become an unorganized, untalented, slop professor. You are brave and i comend you on your exelent work on that even though your cd may be bad."
3,Help,can someone write about the packaging? Is it discreet? I don't want my parents or whoever receives my mail knowing what I buy:)
5,The movie of life,"I was lucky enough to stumble upon the author's website first, and after feeling like I'd stumbled upon something I'd been seeking for a long time, I quickly bought the book. I then read it from cover to cover - twice! The author's view about life being like a movie, and you're the director in charge, certainly creates a different perspective to your own life, and about how you can take control and bring into your life those things you really want. It's a personal development book with a difference. It's incredible, and definitely worth reading, if only to see what the fuss is all about. You never know, it might be something you need in your own movie, in order to continue to the next scene."
3,More Information Is Always Better,"The content of these videos is material written in the late1970s. This was not clear in the Amazon advertising.The storylines and writing are not equal to those of the 1960s programs and some of the content is not appropriate for younger children, say 6 and under."
2,lower quality All Clad pot,"All Clad appears to be trying to cut the cost on their large pots, and while I commend the idea, in practice this pot isn't that well made. The bottom of this pan has the triple thick layer but its not bonded to the sides all that well. Which is really too bad.It's a bit difficult to see from this small photo, but you can see the lip at the bottom of the pot. It's not fully bonded to the sides allowing food to get into it and because its down near the heat, burn into the pan.If you are looking for a large pot, keep looking."
4,Very soothing,"Being cursed with migraines, I'm always looking for any sort of comfort measures to soothe the pain associated with them. I'd heard a lot about ""migraine"" masks, and this one is pretty decent, especially for the price. The little nubbies are connected to pressure points on the forehead, cheeks and temples. It takes a little bit of adjusting with the head strap to find where it is most comfortable, but it feels great once you do. There are several different speeds and setting, although I prefer just the high vibration. The pressure points on the side are a little difficult to get to press as hard as I wanted, but the main part I was concerned about were the pressure points on the forehead, which worked wonderfully. Overall, I was quite happy with the purchase!"
2,Ouch,"This boring movie tells the story of a group of Irish Immigrants who joined the United States Army only for the sake of getting the citizenship. Once they did, they betray this very army because ""they're"" discriminated on religious and ethnic views.A smart man once said ""Believe nothing what you hear, and only half of what you see"". Apart from historical dates, I don't think any of what we've seen in this movie actually happened. It possibly couldn't.If Oscars were given for the bad movies - this one surely would get at least 10.Don't waste your time on this movie."
2,"Half the book is very useful, the other half a waste.","Yes, half of the info in the book is very useful and you can get ideas about what foods to buy that are relatively low in carbs. The other half of the book mentions specific brands of grocery store products that can't even be found in most stores. So, it seems half the book is an advertisement so it winds up being over-priced for what it is. There are likely better low-carb resource books than this one if you want to save and maximize."
2,doesn't fit quite right,The design of the Yamaha air box makes this filter fit loose. They give you grease to fill the gaps at the fitting. So K & N knows its a weird fitment. I would not buy again
1,Save your money!,"PLEASE, save your money! Although I wasted mine, you don't haveto waste yours. This book is a badly written(typos and all)rehash ofwhat you can get from Tony's products. Although I must admit that about 10% of what I read was new to me, I don't necessarily believe it due to the manner it was presented. Just imagine having spent [the money], finnishing the book in a half a day(it's a quick read) and being utterly disapointed. Save yourself the misery and think about getting one of Tony's products for yourself now!"
2,In a word disappointing!,I was very disappointed in the lack of information and the length of the book (very short). No real insight here most of this info (what there was) could be taken from Tony Robbins own books. Not what I expected...and not worth the money!
5,Good Mix Between Action and Relationships,"You get 6 single sided dvds smartly packaged in plastic bookcase covers each one holding two discs. 5.1 surround and reg surround. Subtitled in english, spanish and portugese.There's deleted scenes on each disc and 2 extras on the last disc. The Making of Jericho and What If which shows some higher ups saying how unprepared we all are if this nightmare scenario or something akin to it actually happened, which after the fiasco of Katrina should get us all thinking.I had never seen this show on tv but took a chance after all the good reviews I had read and am glad I bought it.It's a smartly written show with a good blend of action and relationships unfolding in Kansas during and after a Nuclear event.These 22 episodes are well worth the money imo."
1,"If you think 9/11 was carried out by the US government, this is the series for you","The writers bob and weave during the first season, but their true intentions come out during the second. The series is kinda like 24, but with an all-American cast of villains. Conservatives, Karl Rove, Halliburton and Blackwater - all are caricatured. If you want to see a live action version of the conspiracies detailed in Mother Jones, the Nation and In These Times, this is your mini-series."
5,Jericho is a smash,"This is one of the best shows that CBS ever had. It was thrilling, exciting and compeling drama to watch."
3,Jericho - The First Season,"Great series. Discs in good shape, but plastic case is falling apart. Discs will not stay in case after one use."
5,Best Thing On TV in Years,"The storyline and acting are far superior to most other shows on tv. After just a few episodes I was totally hooked. There are a lot of things I could write about how good it is, but my advice is to watch it and see for yourself, its on CBS Friday nights during this summer-with new episodes promised in the fall. I'm planning on ordering several DVD sets as gifts, it is truly a unique show that deserves a long run."
5,Wonderful show!!,"You will not be disappointed if you buy Jericho!! I was hesitant to start watching it, but after I started, I became an instant addict. This show has a little something for everything -- drama, comedy, romance. It is wonderful."
5,amazing show,"I really enjoy the acting, storylines, and the feel of the show. If you don't like it then you probably don't like drama."
3,"titan, ha ha","I've had this water heater in my house for 5 years now, and when it works it is AWESOme. the problem is I have had to return it EVERY year for repair, that means a week to get there, a $50 repair bill, and a week to get it back.This time they sent me a updated unit, maybe I'll have better luck...."
5,Perfect for a condo,"This unit is the best unit we have found for our condo units. In over 3 years, we have had no failed units. I have recommended this unit on our association blog and enjoy the ease of installation. Good product for a great price."
5,This Titan is amazing,I am on my 7th rental property and my 7th Titan unit and I love them. I have been using Titan for over 6 years now and I would never go back to a tank. The unit is reliable and best of all they are made in the good old U.S.A. The tenants love the space saving and specially the energy savings. I would recommend these units to anyone who is looking to save and purchase great American made product.
5,VHS over DVD here,"I first saw this movie years ago. I recently got the DVD of it off of here and their are parts missing from the dvd, little skips. I then got another DVD of it assuming that i got a bad copy, both where the same. So first get the VHS for the whole movie, I rencently got a new VHS of this and it has the entire movie.Now this movie is a really good classic kung fu flick. The training of the young fighter in monkey kung fu and the training of the master of snake style kung fu are very intresting to watch. This film dosent have a deep story but enough to make this movie a great buy for anyone who likes classic kung fu."
2,Poor value,"This book is written in a very ""folksy"" style. The author does provide instructions for constructing ""home-made"" filters and other types of equipment. Regrettably, the paperback version of this book seems to be a xerox copy of the original hardcover edition. All of the pictures are blobs of black and gray, which renders them essentially useless."
5,Great!!!,i have had this belt buckel for about 3-4 years... it is amazing and i love how it looks... its not big like cowboy beltbuckel but is great size for it!
1,What was wrong with D'Nealian?!,"I have three children... one that learned handwriting using D'Nealian (without any tears), and one that learned with this AWFUL and very frustrating program in 2008-2009 school year. I helped out in that kindergarten class, and I found that most of the children had issues with knowing where letters were placed on or within the lines and how the letters were formed. Unfortunately, I have just found out that the pre-school that my third goes to is switching to this confusing program.I, myself, learned with D'Nealian, and I am extremely perplexed as to why everyone is tossing out such a great and established handwriting program for this ""feel good"" (NOT) load of junk.This is one more reason for all of us to be concerned about where America places in world education rankings."
2,Not the original recording.,"While the product details on this listing says the original release date was 1965, this is not the original 1965 recording. This is just a compilation album released in 1992 and there are better James Brown compilation albums out there."
3,Not Induction Compatible,The product looks very nice so I did not want to 1 star it or such. It is shown as induction compatible in the description but that is not the case. Apparently all but a few pieces in the stainless line are induction capable and this is one of the exceptions. I called All Clad to find this out after it would not work on my cook top.
5,"Good Buy, Nice Pot","I bought this when Amazon had it for $59 but haven't use it yet. It's funny when i read the Walls thinner and it's not made as well cause it's from China. It's a Stainless Steel pot, the sides aren't going to burst and since it's a bottom aluminum disc pan you would expect that over tri-ply threw out pans. I have 3 Calphalon stainless steel pans that were made in China and they all cook fine. One day I'll get the chance to see that for myself when I finally do that fish boil I bought the pan for."
5,The Baby-Sitter # 1 by: R.L. Stine,"R.L. Stine's The Baby-Sitter was a very interesting book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. This book is not what it seems with its very twisted ending. Just when you think you know how it is going to end, you find you are wrong. This suspenseful book is impossible to put down. Mixtures of emotions from laughter to fear come upon you while reading this book. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful thriller."
2,almost good.... almost,"R.L. Stine's horror book plots have come somewhat far in the last couple of years. This book defintely wasn't one of his best. If I wanted to read a dull book, I would have chosen the dictionary."
5,"suspence,horror and a brillant storyline into one book.","i first saw this in a shop ,i thought i give it a try .It was one of the most suspence book i ever read it taked me 3 and a half hours, it was worth every minute unitl the terrible truth was out.I read every one of them and they are all brillant .So come on R.L.Stine i want a no5 please!!!!"
5,Leontyne Price and William Warfield in great form,"We were lucky that RCA was willing to record these highlights of Porgy and Bess and there were not contractual problems that prevented a Leontyne Price/William Warfield record of Handel's Messiah. Price and Warfield were performing Messiah with Ormandy/Philadephia Orchestra and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. When Columbia Records originally planned to record, Ormandy, the choir and Warfield were under contract to them Price was under contract to RCA. In those days there was very little loaning out so Columbia substituted Eileen Farrell, their top soprano at the time for the record....ah what could have been. But in the meantime we have this remastered recording which was released at the same time as RCA debuted Dynagrove in the vinyl days. Listen to, ""My Man's Gone Now."" It will bring you to tears."
2,Disappointing,"Alright, I've read the belgariad, the mallorean, the elenium and the tamuli, and well fankly you can only repeat peronalities so many times. Eleria and Aphrael just have too much in common for my liking. Why doesn't he just write a third cycle for the belgariad characters? Even the names are starting to repeat a little bit, ""Sorgan Hook-Beak"" and ""Captain Sorgi"". There are a few genuine characters, like Longbow. But how many versions of Silk, belgarath and Aphrael can you have? And instead of having one or two witty characters with dry humor, every character has it. aarg. But a least the plot idea was good."
1,Very Juvenile,This should have been issued as a children's book. That is the level of reader the book was written for not any adult I know that reads fantasy.
2,A watered down version of the usual Eddings,"When I hear a new Eddings book is due to arrive, I count the days. However with this book, I admit to being disappointed. The characters are pale immitations of the great Eddings books of the past. I was looking for a great story plot with characters that I could connect with and a story that I could get lost in. This book ruined a perfect rainy day for me. What went wrong??"
3,It was....well....,"Call me crazy, but I actually thought it was pretty good. Even though it was predictable, I liked it. I would recomend it to others, but only if you have a lot of time to spare...like an 8 hr. road trip or something..."
1,Utter Dreck!,"Like others here, I had to simply give up. I made the mistake of thinking that since there was more than one book in the series already published, there must be some good material in there.WRONG!Inane phrases and expressions (e.g., when a character says something ""...with no trace of a smile..."") are repeated incessantly. And a character who ""never learned how to miss"" with his bow? Puh-leeeeze! Plus, the romantic ambiguity between characters led me to wonder how this world ever became populated in the first place, as no one ever seems to get past the kissing stage --- and most of that occurs between adults and pre-adolescent Younger Gods.In summary, the three words that best describe it are as follows, and I quote:""Stink. Stank. Stunk."""
2,He hit his stride a long time ago,"The book as okay, but nothing really exciting. I would have expected something much better from David Eddings, but I think he hit his peak with the Belgariad. Ever since he's been sliding down hill.The dialog is quaint and contrived at times, and while the idea of the Dreamers is really good, he could been much better at engaging the readers. I really didn't have much suspense for the entire book, and about the only time I was really interested in what was happening was at the end of the book...I wanted to know if it would be over yet.I really expected better from David Eddings, and probably won't be reading much more of his stuff in the future."
1,Latest eddings book,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This was the first Eddings book, that I never finished reading. I read maybe 150 pages and then said forget it. Not worth reading. His earlier works were great, but eddings keeps playing the same theme over and over, using the same characters from previous books, but different names.If you must read it because it is Eddings, borrow it from the library, or friend. You won't want to pay money for this book"
2,Not Eddings' Best Work,I was very disappointed with this series. It's not the typical David Eddings fare I am used to. Maybe I was expecting something along the lines of the Belgariad series. This story line just never grabbed my attention the way Belgarion and company did.
4,"""Square One"" grows on you...","Gary Taylor is one of the most consistent and talented R&B artists of the past couple of decades. By no means is this his best CD, but ""Square One"" delivers with elegant production, lush instrumentation and passionate lyrics, without a lot of the unneccessary bells, whistles, and carnal angst of his contemporaries. Most every song is excellent, though ""Pieces"" and ""Restless"" could have been omitted; they're not as worthwhile.Overall, ""Square One"" holds up well for an album made in the early 1990s, though it's a little too synth-heavy (Taylor performs most of the keyboards that are the backbone of the music) and mid-tempo to be truly timeless. Despite this, it's worth the trip in the Way-Back Machine. If you're looking for classic ""quiet storm"" music for that laid-back afternoon or romanitc evening, by all means get back to ""Square One."""
1,"Don't join the ""Gateway Nightmare Club""","I don't own this specific model, however I did purchase the Gateway DS 450XL. My laptop worked well for a year and then the nightmare began. The harddrive and screen went bad. I didn't worry because I had purchased the 3 year warranty. After exhanging numerous calls and shipping my laptop back to Gateway. The lapto was returned. It worked well for 2 weeks. I called Gateway again we spent 45 min. attempting the fix the problem. This was unsuccessful. They wanted me to pay another $40 to send the computer back to them . THe service is unsatisfactory and the computer had never worked properly since the first year. Owning a Gateway Product is a nightmare and trying to keep their produts running well is a full time job. I will NEVER purchase another Gateway product. I wouldn't even accept one as a gift."
3,Dictionary of Modern Electronics Technology,I read and study technology in many forums and I purchased this Dictionary to try to keep the jargon in line with the studies and reviews. I does help to have a source for coordination of terms and reference information. Has helped me several time when I have looked up subject matter and tied some information together.
3,My Fender,Love the product got here ahead of scheduled time. The only thing I would suggest that the sellor put up a picture that does not trick you in thinking that the device is wireless
2,Worried about my DVD Player.,"""CLAMBAKE"" happens to be my favorite ELVIS movie. So needless to say I was sodisappointed to have THAT disk come damaged. Yes, it plays, when the disk firststarts it makes a frightening grating, moaning sound as it continues the noise doessubside. In looking over the disk, there is a wavy type of a spot that starts from the center hole and goes to about 1/3 of the disk. It looks like a water mark.I guess I will have to get it replaced. I so hate this part."
3,collectors music,"well, if it's a rainy day....head to the clambake...this musical was a typical presley flickmost of the music is not the same as issued on the soundtrack..and red west playing a ice cream man....!"
3,Poor quality source and/or transfer to DVD,"Clambake starring Elvis Presley,Shelley Fabares,Will Hutchins,Bill Bixby,Gary Merrill,and James Gregory was an entertaining film with a very good cast.It's a take-off on the ""Prince and the Pauper"" story of a rich man that swaps identity with a poor man and wants to see if he can be a success without the family wealth.Too bad the quality of the print used in making this DVD was poor.The sharpness is disappointing, the color is weak, and there are numerous artifacts seen such as scratches and streaks.Also,the soundtrack is mediocre at best,even though a true HiFi/stereo soundtrack was originally recorded by Elvis for this release.There is no excuse for this hatchet-job,and I recommend you avoid purchasing this title until a respectable effort is made to produce a high-quality copy of this film.If you are a die-hard Elvis fan you'll probably buy it for your library,but the studio did justice to no one with the release of this DVD.Shame on the greedy leeches!"
3,Elvis in the lab - who could ask for anything more,"As a scientist, I have to say that what makes this movie special to me is that it features a scene with Elvis working in a laboratory. He develops his own glue to repair a boat in time for the big race. He tells another character that he has a degree in engineering. I never dreamed I'd get to see Elvis as a scientist - this movie is one of a kind!"
4,Learn the History of Your Country,"If you really want to learn the history of your country, how this country was built upon a system of cultural genocide, I highly recommend this book. Particularly for college students, this can be a very valuable book. Tinker is extremely clear in making his points. He even spells out his thesis for you in the 4th page of the book. He literally says ""My thesis is."" Tinker focuses on various missionaries, how they were engaged in cultural, economic and physical genocide in order to convert various Indian tribes.He also uses primary sources to cite his work and he's very credible in that regard.Highly recommend it for a reader not pursuing any sociology or historical studies. You'll certainly learn a lot about how this country was established on the grounds of genocide."
5,Very easy to use,We had a similar product from a large wholesaler that lasted for several years but finally broke. We replaced it with this and are very pleased. It's really simple to use and opens bottles easily. The grip is easy on your hands too.Recommended.
1,Not so great,"The Metrokane Rabbit Corkscrew worked fine for 1 1/2 years with regular home use. Then it broke. Returned it according to the warranty terms provided in the packaging, and was notified that I owed $10 in mailing and handling (not disclosed in the original warranty language). Paid the $10 and still waiting for the replacement.I had previously owned a ScrewPull and it worked great for about 8 years. As best I can tell there is no major difference between the two except that the ScrewPull works and doesn't break! Probably worth the extra dollars."
4,Metrokane Rabbit Corkscrew,"Very easy to use on almost any wine bottle,and any type of ""cork"". Didn't push any pieces of cork into bottle."
1,disappointing,I had a similar corkscrew which lasted 14 years. I bought this because of the nice red color.That was finally the only good thing about it. It was heavy to use and the plastic handle gave up after som 150 bottles. 10 years guarantee - hah - Metrokane doesnt even bother to answer the mails and claims
3,Breakage,We have had one of these wine bottle openers for a few years. Recently the device stopped opening corks due to the screw part not staying fixed in position while withdrawing the cork so that it merely unwinds from cork without removing it. There does not seem to be anyway to repair it. It worked well for a few years and this suddenly occured.
1,"Update to ""Pretty Good""","After using this device for a few more months, and being *very* careful and gentle with it, I find I can no longer recommend it.I've used the several new screws Metrokane sent back after the last ""repair.""The problem always first occurs when trying to remove the cork from the device after it has removed the cork from the bottle. You begin operating it in reverse but it does not release the cork, it only seems to bend and distort the screw.Perhaps Metrokane should have replaced the mechanism when first sent in for repair. I had some doubts at that time that the two ends of the tool were still properly aligned; but Metrokane chose to send it back to me with 2 new screws, both of which now are ruined.I don't think I did anything to abuse or misuse it.I think Metrokane should rework the design of the mechanism or actually repair it when returned by customers.I no longer recommend it. It's too expensive to be this unreliable."
2,Am I doing something wrong,"I just purchased my rabbit last week and have opened 2 bottles of Talus wines. They use synthetic corks. I almost never opened the first bottle. I spun the bottle off the corkscrew 3 times, reinserted and strained until the first finally opened. The second took only 1 try, with a considerable amount of force applied. Has anyone else encountered this? Am I doing something wrong? Is the problem unique to the Talus corks - (I intend to try a real cork this week). If anyone has any ideas, please share them."
2,When it works it's great!,"Just like the title says, when this mechanism works it's wonderful, but my first one ceased to function within a dozen or so uses. Assuming it was me, I purchased another, and lo and behold, the same problem.Perhaps it's the French wine!Butch Mazzuca, AuthorFrom the First Date to the Bedroom, the Single Man's Official Guide to Success with Women."
3,"Metrokane Rabbit Corckscrew with Foilcutter, black","I bought two of these for Christmas last year. One I kept, the other I gave as a gift. While mine worked it was great, however, after about 6 - 7 months it broke. At the time, I couldn't find the address, etc., to write to complain because my understanding was that it would be replaced if it didn't work, so I still have it - not useable - and I have reverted to the plain old corkscrew which I purchased at the supermarket for about $7.00."
2,This Thing is Junk!,"This thing is truly junkware! My wife bought me the earlier version which did not have the metal gears. It worked well for a while and then one day, poof! three bottles in a row, (figured operator error at first) during a party, get the cork stuffed in! After some examination, a plastic fitting on the beast had cracked. I used it maybe 30 times and since it was now off warranty timewise I chucked it.Months later I purchased the new and improved metal model. Well here it is maybe 2 years and only about as many uses as before and the thing pushes the cork into a lovely bottle of Shiraz. I don't even attempt to use it thing usually, thus the low mileage, because it makes me nervous. I much prefer my old trusty wing model or even my waiters screw. I uncork about two-or-three bottles a week and they never give me a problem.Too bad. It's really a nicely designed and aesthetically pleasing piece of junk."
2,Just a Collection of Whitepapers,"I purchased this book looking for an overall, logically flowing picture of the ASP concept. While the content is valid, I was disappointed to find that it was just a collection of publicly available white papers and industry articles. The book is smaller than I thought - only 300 pages, and it contains advertisements for various vendors (the only color sections of the book). There are many graphs and pie charts that are useless because the different segments are all different shades of gray, and I think that it is far too much to spend for what seems to be a collection of white papers an intern could assemble after surfing the web for an afternoon."
2,Order for your model only.,"I have an Archos 504 and thought that the cases were ""one model fits all"", but they are not (my mistake). The 504/80 Gb is deeper than the 604 and the case is bursting and does not hold the Archos securely. Because it does not fit well, the Archos may fall out upon opening the case. Make sure you order the correct case for your Archos."
4,6 year old son likes it,"Good game, a little hard for my 6 year old, but I told him if they made it easy he would have got bored with it by now. He's persevered and got almost to the last level. Great for a Noddy fan."
4,Great for the Price,I thought this was a great product for $5. It wasn't the greatest but it got the job done and you can't beat that price!
1,NOT WHAT IT IS ADVERTISED AS,WRONG DIMENSIONS ARE STATED IN REVIEW. HAD TO RETURN TWICE. WILL SAY AMAZON DID A GREAT JOB RETURNING PRODUCT AND REFUNDING MY MONEY
5,Great Stuff,"Optimum Nutrition provides a good quality protein at a more economical price than most brands, but yet doesn't skimp on the quality. The Casein chocolate supreme flavor is one of the best tasting chocolate protein powders on the market. It is thick and flavorful and I would drink it as a shake even if it wasn't a protein drink. If I had to make any improvements it would be on how easily the powder mixes. Although better than most powders on the market I would recommend a shaker if not a blender. Mixing by spoon in a glass does fairly well but you can sometimes end up with clumps. Mixes great with milk, water, yogurt, and all other things I've tried. Goes great with many shake recipes including one of my favorites, 8 oz milk, 3 drops of mint extract, and tastes like the girl scout mint/grashopper chocolate cookies."
