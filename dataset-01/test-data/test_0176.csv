5,"Some great music, some trite lyrics","This album perfectly encapsulates the mood of young, middle-class white people during the mid-1990s. The music itself is stellar. The lyrics range from multi-layered brilliance (""Brick,"" ""Selfless, Cold and Composed"") to inconsequential, Seinfeld-esque nothingless (""Steven's Last Night in Town,"" ""Battle of Who Could Care Less""). From ""Battle"": ""And you think Rockford Files is cool./But there are some things that you would change if it were up to you"" ... Give me a break! But that's the 90s for you. ""Brick"" may be one of the greatest songs to come out of that decade."
4,Good blend of new and classic elements,"A retelling of the fairy tale The Little Mermaid from the Once Upon a Time series.As with the best retellings, there are enough twists on the classic tale to make this a retelling worth reading, while still maintaining the basic features of the original story. Elements of both the Andersen version and the Disney version are taken and successfully blended with wholly original features. Two sets of lovers mix things up a bit and keep the reader guessing as to who will eventually end up together. The characters are likable and the resolution, while fairly predictable, is satisfying. While I've so far liked Dokey's additions to this series the best, Viguie's books are a close second. Viguie's tend to be a little darker, more serious, older, and more sensual, though not smutty or graphic at all. Both authors have a knack for writing with beautiful imagery, and Midnight Pearls is no exception.A solid addition to the Once Upon a Time series. Recommended."
2,Didn't like it much,I don't like this book too much. It was supposed to be a re-telling of the LIttle Mermaid but it did't impress me much. I thought other fairy tales such as Snow and Spirted were better.
2,Nothing special,There is absolutely nothing special about this album. The songs are boring and redundant. If you do not buy this album you will not miss a thing.
1,Oops Looks Like Some One Done Made a mistake,This cd is [BAD]!!!! And I hate that song OOPS. It should be the background music for a porno or something. It's so pervertated and for what? Is that what this industry needs. NOT!!!!!! It's too much of that already going on. Dont Buy. One love.
5,Excellent CD!,"I bought Tweet's CD not knowing exactly what to expect, and, I must admit, I had to listen to it a couple of times before I really felt her music. But now...damn...I am loving this CD! I haven't stopped playing it since. Her music is definitely for the more mature crowd who enjoys listening to soul music, not simply R&B. Most of her tracks are mellow and relaxing with her soft vocals and musical arrangements. It's hard to believe she's a Missy protege because she definitely holds her own. My favorite tracks are Complain, Beautiful, My Place, Best Friend. This CD is worth the [the money] I paid for it. Tweet and Angie Stone are the best CD's I've purchased this year!"
3,its a first koo! effort despite da intro bite!,"This album is cool, but i couldnt get pass da fact that tweets intro sounds a lot like tiorahs intro, which this album was done way before tweets, inwhich we sent the tiorahs material to certain industry ppl when we were trying to get them signed. But anyway other than the sound bite, tweets album is hella koo! although i dont really know how to rate her style as either being r&b or neo soul with a contemporary twist to it."
5,Tweet has a HOT AZZ book out!,"Has anyone went to the Kindle Store and bought Tweet's book called ""Love Is the Drug""? It's fire! It's about Real Roxanne and I love how this girl writes a love story. Not to mention the drama in it. Unfortunately I only saw it in the Kindle Store and Mobipocket but it's too stupid (meaning good)."
5,a blast from the past,"My wife shared with me last evening how she loved this tape as a child. We laughed as she recounted the fun she had as the songs played. It was a tape she recently found again after many years of storage. Unfortunately, after our stereo ate her prcious tape we thought we'd never replace it. Here it is! She'll be so excited that some day our kids will have the chance to enjoy this as much as she did."
4,I Enjoy It More Than My Son,"I purchased this CD for the daily car trips around town when my son is with me. Most every track has characters talking, giving intros to the letters and such. All very cute, very Seasame Street - and 100% a stroll down memory lane. I'm not sure if it's all in mono, but most of the songs are from way way back - probably 70's and 80's. I get a kick out of it because it's nostalgic; and my son enjoys it because he gets to sing along and learn the alphabet."
2,Here is a different perspective.....,"I read the other reviews and was really looking forward to reading this book. I was very disappointed. After you have read one chapter, you have read the whole thing. Let me summarize for you: Dean is super talented and didn't like to, or need to rehearse. Greg Garrison is a genius. All of the guest stars were wonderful and were amazed that Dean did not rehearse. All the women loved Dean. The end. I just saved you several hours."
4,Book review,"Excellent but sad chronology of the end of the variety era. Very well written, insightful and seemingly accurate portrayal of the times. Worth it for the Dean Martin fan. It certainly was for me. Devoured it in a few days."
2,Good ending and begining but middle needs more.,The movie starts out ok but nothing to get excited about. There is one witty line. For the most part Steve mcqueen looks out of place with his un shaven face. Everyone else is clean shaven and has a standard issue rifle. The ending has fantastic explosions and I love it. It almost makes up for the lack of content for the rest of the movie. I'll say that it becomes comical when Steve Mcqueen is faster then a speeding bullet. Its surprising he needs a motorcyle in the next movie the great escape.
3,"For Hollywood, War is usually Heck, not Hell","""Hell is for Heroes"" is an entertaining movie that should be viewed in comparison to other WWII films of the era.This movie is an important link between the cheesy propaganda films of the 50's (""To Hell and Back""), and the fatalistic films of the late 60's (""Anzio"").There are light hearted characters (played by Bobby Darin and Bob Newhart), as well as surly, serious ones (played by Steve McQueen and Harry Guardiano). There are comical battle scenes (a blanket thrown up in the air to draw German machine gun fire) and tragic battle scenes (James Coburn getting killed in a minefield).The movie was filmed in California among oak trees, but it is done in B&W; which hides and filters much of the cheap scenery. However, the location does lend the movie to a ""made-for-tv"" feeling."
2,Not memorable,"This is one of those movies that belongs on at three in the morning. Some of the acting is embarassing (such as the Captian and most of the opening shot). The plot and story are good, but it never-the-less seems thrown together. McQueen was good but overall it just wasn't worth spending money on. I wonder if I can get my money back..."
1,Not worth buying very poor value for money,A dreadful script not worth watching this very dull film. It must indeed be Steve McQueen''s worst film but with a script as dull as this one is perhaps he did what he could.
5,One of the all-time greatest War movies! Not to be missed!!,"I was born in 1954 and went to see this one when it first came out. I was all of eight years old. What an extremely profound impact it would have on my life. I eventually went on to serve as an officer in the USMC, partly because of the heroism depicted in this movie. Each time that I watch it now, I sympathize with the characters that are sent to cover a sector of the Sigfried line and one morning wake to find that the rest of the company has pulled leaving only their squad to defend the company-sized front. How desperate their reaction! They do the right thing - they go on the offensive! I won't spoil it for you. It is an excellent movie well worth adding to any collection. No war movie collector would be without it. Great performances by Fess Parker, Steve McQueen, Nick Adams, Bobby Darin, James Coburn, Bob Newhart, Harry Guardino and others who also went on to become famous character acters. Well worth owning at any price!!!"
2,Difficult to read,I bought and returned this book. The terminology is very British which means you need to look up conversions for your needle size and inches and yarn size. It was very difficult to read.
2,Nothing Special,I did not like the way a lot of the directions were written in this book. I think there are better instructional manuals out there.
3,Fair Assortment of Pop Hits,"Most of these tracks can be found on better collections (and CDs with less embarrassing titles than this one). The inclusion of the rare novelty track ""The Fonz Song"" by the Heyettes is worth the price for serious collectors. All original versions."
4,Nice !,I bought this for my mother in law and she loved it. I may not suggest this for young women though!
5,Timeless.,"This was one of my favorite books as a child in Australia. Now as a father in America, it has become on of my childrens' favorite books too. Give your children (and yourself) a lifetime of smiles and warm fuzzies with this one."
4,harry the dirty dog,"I like harry the Dirty Dog because he,s funny.He can do funny stuff. I like the part when his family did not know who he was. [Come agin next time and read it again."
3,Key Scene is Eliminated. What's up with that?,"Witness is a wonderful film. It has all the interesting relationships covered, love, family, partners, parents, and children. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with its suspense. And the journey into the Amish world is a great one. But, what happened when this DVD was made. There's a key scene when Book's sister, Elaine, comes downstairs to find Rachel has cleaned the kitchen and taken a motherly role in the house. There's an argument and Rachel goes up to apologize and make amends with Book's sister. It's wonderful stuff, and it has just vanished from this DVD version. Why? How tragic."
3,Disappointed!,I don't know why every movie has to be ruined by cussing and nudity. I know that the true Amish are very humble and modest people. To see an Amish woman stand in front of a man naked was sad to see. It really wasn't necessary to do that to get the point across.
4,strathwood wicker bistro chair,"The Chair was a little smaller than I expected but I love it anyway. I am going to order another, it fits perfactly on my small patio"
4,Very good exam cram,"It's a very good cram, but it's a little bit confusing from times to times. Use it in combination with Oracle8i Tips & Techniques and you've got yourself enough preparation material for the exam."
2,Do not buy,"Although it was already stated that it was not pre-assembled, I knew how to align the pins in the correct spot. The cap that the pins go through is always popping off however."
2,Won't hold up well (and wrong color),"We received this luggage as a wedding gift, and for the price I guess it's ok. I was expecting much better quality from Eddie Bauer, however. We used the large piece once (for our honeymoon), and the trim around the outside was already busting off when we returned. The luggage doesn't look terribly high quality, and after only one trip already looks well used.Again, it's not bad for the price as long as you're not expecting something high quality. We anticipate getting maybe a year out of this based on the wear and tear just one trip wrought.Finally, the photo makes this look like it's a nice grey color. In fact, it's very much green, which I don't like."
3,Luggage broke on my first trip!,"I don't know whether to blame the luggage or the airline, but the large suitcase broke on my first trip. :( The actual side cracked and the top is dented beyond repair. To be fair-I can't bend it back so it must have taken some extreme beating for it to have bent in the first place. Still usable, but disappointing at the least."
4,Not bad for the price,"I must say I didn't know what to expect since the reviews were a little mixed. This isn't the world's best luggage of course, but for the price you pay to get all the bags (which I would say are above average quality for nested luggage). This includes a bag that could be used for small laptops, the only negative is that it has no inner pockets to keep things like pens organized. But overall, if you are looking to not spend a ton of money and get a decent set of luggage, I would recommend this."
5,Built Strong for Hours of Fun!,"I remember when I was a child and I received a Tonka dump truck for Christmas. Now that I have my own son, I've carried on the tradition and purchased one for him. Tonka has always been known for their strong and durable toys, and this mighty dump truck keeps up the tradition. Although no longer completely made out of steel, the plastic is still stong and durable and holds up very well. The colors are bright and inviting, and the main parts (i.e. dumper and cab) are still made from steel. I highly recommend this excellent toy. I hope my son gets as much joy and fun from his new mighty dump truck as I did when I had mine."
3,Why did Hogan have to lose the belt ???,"Were people getting bored of Hogan being champ that Vince McMahon had to get the ol' Boofster pinned ? i think they should have kept Warrior and Hogan at the same power level between warrior madness and Hulkamania?, not one coming over the other.Besides, waht kind of splaash was that at the end of the match to finish off 300 pound Hogan ?"
4,Excellent Series,This series is the best of any pokemon series because the hero is not a dork. he actually trains and captures pokemon that are very strong. if you are a fan of pokemon this series is for you!!!
2,absolutely no discernable plot line,"Whoever waited for this novel should wait longer. I will admit I read it all the way through....only to see how he tied all the various wide ranging threads of the plot together. Much to my dismay he didn't.I still haven't a clue what the novel was really about...class warfare? the evils of nano-technology? industrial spying? greed? who knows...I certainly don't, and I'm not sure the author does either.Better luck next time Mr. Marusek"
2,Do yourself a favor and just buy the ordinary ones,"I bought this controller a year ago. It busted 9 months ago. If you do the math, the G-force only lasted for 3 months. I thought it would operate just the same as a normal controller, but for a cheaper price. WRONG! The joystick didnt move with as much ease as my normal controllers and I found absolutely no use whatsoever for the ""auto-fire"" mode. Let me also point out that the Z button trigger, dual vibration motors, and camera sticks are ALL featured in your regular-average- joe Nintendo controls. It's also bigger than the normal design, which doesnt work to well with my short hands. My advice: Just don't buy it."
1,"Looks nice, but stops working","I bought three of these controllers to go with my new game cube, and I have found that it looks nice, but the controls start to mess up after a while. I have had it for a month or two, and all three have begun to go on the fritz. The cursor moves on the screen by its self and is extra sensitive in one direction and hardly moves in the others. It may look good in the packaging, but it is very top heavy and the back is bigger than on the nintendo controller. The turbo button isnt compatable with super smash bros. melee but for some reason the turbo light stays on, no matter how many times the button is pressed. That isnt really much of a problem when compared to the extra weight and size. My solution: go for the nintendo controller."
1,Don't Try To Save The Money,"I Bought this controller about 6 months ago, and it broke in 1 week. It doesn't even work with half of the games i've played. It's too big, and it is much harder to move the control stick. Every review i read said it broke for them too. There is one other thing that nobody mentioned. The cord for the standard controller is what, 5 feet? i seriously think this one is three.For anyone buying this to save money, you're just going to have to pay more money to buy a nintendo brand one when it breaks! Summarized in three words: Piece of Junk. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,good while it lasts,"I recently bought a G-force computer from this site and it was awesome! However after a few days the errors became phenominal. Whenever you move the control-stick, it moves one way or another, but not the one you told it to go. I tried holding the stick in the middle and then playing, but the same thing happened. I returned this product and bought a brand new one and sure enough, in the next few days, the same thing happened.I hate this product but if you like [bad] products, then this one's for you!"
1,Not worth it...,"The money saved on it is just not worth it!!Maybe my kids are especially rough on controllers, this one broke within a month. From now on I will only buy accessories from Nintendo. I have learned this lesson the hard way, and more than once with other items that were not made by Ninendo (especially controllers), hoping to save a few $$, but in the end... you spend MORE money to get a decent product that will have much better durability.I do not recommend this product."
4,Mine works just fine,"I don't know about the others, but my controller has been working for almost a year now. It is a little bulky, but nothing stops this die hard gamer who has all of the systems but x-box from using this wonderful controller. I can't wait to get my mario edition one!"
2,Publishers Weekly has it right!,I had high hopes for this book when I read the inside cover. Unfortunately this novel meanders all over the place.The conclusion of the book left me empty as if Balthasar took a wrong turn on his journey and never quite got back on track. The book does blend the historical events of 1666 quite well. That still doesn't help this story recover.
1,Viair onboard air kit 20052,"Complete waste of money. You would be far better off purchasing the components separately and making your own system. You end up needing different electrical connectors, plus the tubing that comes with the system is almost unusable. It's impossible to straighten, and cracks in extreme cold. A rubber hose with your own fittings would be far better suited for running the hose to your tank. However, you still need to use some of the small tubing if you plan on using the Viair gauge/switch.Overall, I'm really disappointed with this. For 100 bucks including shipping, I would expect more. I ended up spending about 50 dollars more just to make this adequate for what I needed. I will say, however, that the Viair gauge/switch is pretty decent quality and looks great once installed."
5,good affirmations to help get you on the right track,i like these affirmations. they are simple and straight forward which is what i was looking for. i like the pictures and they aren't distracting. i basically flip to a page and think about the affirmation over and over. i plan to do this even more often and maybe even meditate or write about some of the affirmations in my journal.i think this would make a nice positive gift to the people in your life looking for positive affirmations. it's easy to keep on you if you want to be motivated anytime or anywhere.
2,Not what I ordered!,"This item was supposed to be a book of affirmations with relevant drawings, much like the cards. Instead, I received a blank book with a cover that was similar to the picture on Amazon. I was extremely disappointed!"
1,An almost painful read,"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers - great plot, poor execution. The author's writing style is very limitied - she keeps repeating the same information over and over and it's trying to keep reading to get to new information. Then she'll bring up an event that happened in the character's past, then drop it and not follow-through with more information. I'm about 2/3 thru the book and while I'm curious to find out how it ends, I don't think I can continue."
5,As usual - it just gets better,"...The music is soothing, exciting, moody, uplifting and complex. It excites the imagination, even for the dullest of minds. The overtones... the undertones... it all screams to be psychoanalyzed and examined on every level. OP puts out recordings, including this one, that I can only describe as epic. This is a buy..."
4,If you liked Unrestricted....,"You'll love this album. While the lyrics on Unrestricted were undoubtedly Da Brat's rawest to date, I think the beats on the Anuthatantrum tracks are catchier. Unfortunately, Da Brat seems to have lost her edge with her latest effort Luv & Limelight, as one reviewer aptly pointed out, it's all about f**king other girl's boyfriends. Boring. Unrestricted was Brat at her hottest. Anuthatantrum was wasn't as mainstream, but maybe that's part of the reason I like it better, because it has ""new"" songs that I haven't heard over and over again."
3,There should have never been TWO Tantrum albums,"The ONLY thing missing from this CD is two songs. These two songs are ""B side (squeaky clean)"" & ""Sitton on top of the world, pt.2"" and they both come from ""AnuthaFUNKDAFIEDtantrum"" album. I still have no idea why they decided to make TWO tantrum CD's. There was absolutely no point whatsoever, considering the fact that half the songs come from THIS cd anyway. ""AnuthaFUNKDAFIEDtantrum"" should have NEVER been created. That was a terrible mistake. All they needed to add were two songs to this CD to make it complete. Unfortunately, this cd will always be missing something.....and u can tell when u listen to it. Without those two songs this album is just.......well........i hate to say it because it's such a common word but...IT'S AVERAGE. That's it. Album still offers good songs though. I'll leave y'all on that. Love, Peace, N' Chicken Grease."
2,"Not horrible, but Baraka is considerably better.","I would probably give this 2 and a half stars, if that were possible. I didn't hate it, but it isn't one I'd watch again. It was tempting to stop watching two thirds of the way through, actually. The music got downright annoying in its repetitiveness -- to the point we muted it. Then, the imagery got to be so plain and lacking artistic angles that we decided it was a film to be watched when we wanted to get sleepy. We had been planning on watching this whole group of DVDs. This was the first one we watched, and it made us hesitant about all the others. However, since we saw The Monkey Chant on YouTube and discovered it was a segment from ""Baraka,"" we decided to go ahead and watch ""Baraka."" It is a much, much better selection of both music and imagery than this film delivers."
5,A now necessary perspective,"I first saw this film many years ago around the time of its original release, and was enthralled with everything about it. The film sort of puts you up into the corner of the room, looking down at what could just as well be society of ants (us!), and alows us to gain a certain type of perspective about the world, and ourselves, which seems to be needed even more these days. I agree with another reviewer; let's have this film distributed again so people can see it, and gain value from it."
5,Muy buen producto,Encargué la trilogía qatsi y todo salió perfecto. Llegaron en tiempo y se miran muy bien. La trilogía es maravillosa y el servicio fué muy bueno :).
2,Not worth the energy....,"It doesn't matter what aspect ratio it's in, it is a horrendous movie either way. there are people praising this, and it does not deserve that praise.I'm an art major. I like the so called weird, flaky stuff. Koyaanisqatsi, however, made me want to gouge my eyes out. This movie is just an example of what people do when they have too much money. Nest time, give that money to me, and save the world from a horrendous waste of time."
1,"Great movie, low quality",The movie is great. I haven't seen it in 15 years and was terribly let down by the amazon video quality. This movie shod only stream in hd.
4,A Great R&B Soul That's Missed,"Jon B. was an excellent star is truly missed in the R&B game right now. He needed a good marketing team to get his music out, but horribly failed. This CD did pretty good as far as sales, but it could've went much further. This album has no fillers, you could listen to it from beginning to end without skipping. The standout tracks are ""Don't Say"", ""Are You Still Down"", ""They Don't Know"", "" I Do"", as well as others. If you don't have this album or his last major label ""Pleasure U Like"" you should definitely check it out."
4,Super Scrabble-athon,This is larger version of an old favorite. If you love word games you should like the larger version of Scrabble. I recently had a guest visit for 7 days and we managed a game a day and thoroughly enjoyed our time together and the challenge of filling a larger board. I think that this game is especially good for people who have always loved Scrabble and would like more. Since the games are lengthy I'd recommend that 'newbies' start with the smaller version for quick play - and for the love of the game to grow on them. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the packaging and board and if you are a serious Scrabbler and want a board game that lasts it might be worth a few more dollars to find a better edition.
1,"I love this game, but...","I had originally bought the 2002 edition, which was positively wonderful. It was so wonderful that I decided to get a second copy. That was a big mistake, because the second copy was the 2010 edition. What was wrong? Nearly everything, except the game itself:The tiles are no longer wood, but some composite plastic, which not only stinks, but the printing of the letters is blurred - they aren't even an even size. I guess we need BPA-free games!The tile bag is cheap, and doesn't even close properly.The board is thinner, and of poorer quality. The only thing holding the two sides together is thin plasticized paper.Everything is cheap and plastic. This went from being a joy to play to entirely too obnoxious to use.So I guess it's possible to wreck anything."
4,fun for hours!,"We had a lot of fun playing the newest addition to the Scrabble family! Here are a few facts:It does take a lot longer to play this game! Know this going into it! Also, we are used to playing on the Deluxe model, so going back to the basic board is no fun! Having the tiles slide all over the place stinks! But it was GREAT having so many more E's to use, that alone is reason to try!! The amount of 7 letter words we were able to play was unbelievable! The first game we played I ended up with a score of 784!!! WOW! It is a great game and is a lot of fun, just as the other was! Highly recommend!"
4,supersize your scrabble fun!,"When you have a crowd that loves scrabble, the ""special"" size gives you more squares, bonus squares, and longer games for better fun."
4,cscarter,This toy is great fun for my 2 year old grandson and 6 year old granddaughter. My order was shipped promptly and received in less than a week. Thanks!!!
4,Great outdoor play,The base could be heavier and overall made a little stronger. My three year old grandson broke this several times when he was hitting it directly off the tee but they replaced it with no problem.
4,Needs more balls!,"We purchased this for my son's 3rd birthday, he loves it. My only complaint would be that it only pitches 3 balls and then it's done and you have to reset it again. My son is getting better and better at hitting the balls since we purchased this for him, it's also fun for Mom and Dad to play too!!!!! I would recommend this toy to anyone who wants to help their kids learn how to play baseball."
1,Unbelievably loud!,I bought this toy thinking that it was like the Little Tikes one that my son's friend has (which he plays with for hours and hours). The Little Tikes one seems to have a catapult mechanism -- this one is like the loudest leaf-blower you have ever heard! It's really distracting and annoying -- so much so that we never use it in the house and it's even a pain outside. Very annoyed with this purchase.
4,A great one! Makes me feel in Christmas all the year!,"For those who loves interesting guitar arrangements, this is for you! All tracks are rich in details and technique (if you don't believe me, just take a look to the musicians there). I'm quite impressed with the participation of Eric Johnson, the 'Master of Tones', who demonstrates here he's not only a marvelous guitarist, but a great MUSICIAN too."
5,Moose Teeth,Cute book and my granddaughter loves it and we're hoping it'll help her brush her teeth more cooperatively. Book came in condition and in a timely manner as promised.
1,Had to buy it,awesome book if you are a cricket fan. If not do not buy it. It was boring and basically forced to read it
3,Nice Reference,"I really liked this book. Most Wicca 101 books come with a chapter on magick spells and Magickal Correspondences. This book basically takes that chapter and blows it up into something a little more useful.However it doesn't contain any info on raisng and focusing power or using visualizations so if you don't already have a book on that (Laurie Cabot, Scott Cunningham, Silver Ravenwolf etc.) yer gonna have a recipe book. I think it makes a good companion piece to a book that teaches a specific magickal path.Note: Conservative Wiccans aren't gonna like this one, it challenges the Law of 3 and the idea of not using person specific love spells. If you have serious problems with that i'd stay away from this one."
1,the worst kreator release ever!,sadly after coma of souls and extreme aggression they desided to change the formula an with that they lost alot of fans.them music scene was changing alot at this time but this change was to much and a poor choice.
1,the worst cd in their career seriously save your time & money,this is one of the cds were kreator experimented with their music and they lost this round.I like alot of different music but this is a lame duck.they tried a more industrial type of music but is a lost chance to improve thier sound i owned this cd for years but i can't remember anything about it but it was awfull and i couldn't stand the cd.this is the worst kreator cd ever.
2,Who is this ?,"First, let me say that I am a very big Kreator fan. I do not like this album. I honestly can not stand listening to this album. The production is weak and thin and it really does not sound anything like any of the previous Kreator albums. I understand that bands might want to change and experiment, but I just cant get into this."
5,Fine example of personal documentaries,"I haven't read Frank's books but the video immediately grabbed my attention as I tried to sort out the various brothers and timelines.Superior to the following ""McCourts of New York,"" the brothers opened up to the nephew in terms of their upbringing, how their street geography defined their view of the world, & great slips of past plays.I particularly loved Frank's story of stealing apples on base and how the American soldiers threatened to execute the starving boys who couldn't work up the nerve to ask for jam or butter on their bread as a ""last meal.""Also Malachy's tearful story of their father and a faerie spring was touching and gave a glimpse of a truly magical episode. Even more heart rendering was the story of their mother anticipating his increasingly infrequent returns.This isn't on Netflix so I would definitely reccomend checking this out."
5,Never too old for animation,"I am a fan of the Transformers, but Transformers:Prime is awesome. I purchased from Amazon Season One and anxiously awaiting for Season Two. I have a large selection of animated movies and I would have to say that Transformers Prime is the best for me. Go out and buy it - you won't regret it."
3,"Good idea, good gift","I purchased this for my Mother for Christmas. She is elderly and lives by herself. We had tried another similar product a few years ago but with very mixed results.It was easy to set up and easy to operate and the built in system tests give you piece of mind that it is functioning.The BAD, hers was in operation until today when the base unit lost power. We tried everything with no results. I called the companies customer service and got a very nice gentleman that is sending a replacement unit out today. This is somewhat disconcerting but a quick glance at the base unit showed that it had no power and then a quick system check confirmed that.I'll let you know when we get the replacement and how it works."
3,Guardian Alert 911,"I purchased this for a friend who has Parkinson's. Her hands shake badly and she can barely walk. We set it up and it seems fine, but of course she hasn't had to use it yet so I don't know how well it will work, . The only thing I'm concerned about is that the button is VERY hard to push, and is too small. Not the emergency button, which is somewhat larger, but the one that you use to test the product to make sure the battery is good and in what areas the Guardian will work. It is very important for her to be able to do these checks, so I can't rate the product especially highly. Otherwise it seems like a good product, especially since it's a one time fee and not monthly. She wouldn't have been able to afford a monthly fee along with the land line phone she had to have installed for the Guardian to work. All in all, I think it's a great idea and I hope it works if needed.Lee Ratcliffe"
3,Not having the same problems as others,"The filter keeps overflowing, clogging the drip mechanism, thus making a pot of sludge--I either have to drink it (or eat it, depending on how many grounds get in the coffee) or make another pot and hope it doesn't clog up. It doesn't differentiate from pre-ground coffee or if I use the grinder.I don't see that much difference in this and my old coffee maker (a Sunbeam), except for the grinder. My coffee is still good, though it does take a few pots to get the strength right--the cups measure 5 oz. on this machine, and I'm used to measuring for 6 oz cups.Cleaning this, to me, takes the same amount of time as my old coffee maker.This was given to me as a gift, and I like it overall."
1,great when it used to work,bought a refurbished one. it worked for a little over the 90 day warranty period. then the grinder stopped working.
4,nice coffee maker,"This is our second one of these models. Our first one we bought approx 6 years ago and it started leaking water after it was around 3 years old. My wife insisted that we get the same model to replace the leaking one, so we did. Hopefully this one lasts a little longer than the old one. Six years out of a coffee maker isn't that bad though. This unit makes great coffee, is easy to use, and also has a built in grinder. works great."
5,A GREAT MACHINE!,I don't undertand all the negative reviews. At first I had to get used to the machine & yes you have to clean more parts than regular cofee maker but don't people have to clean their grinder and coffee maker parts anyways??!! I've had it over a year and I just love it!! I like that the hot pad is not kept on. The stainless steel thermos keeps it fresh & warm/hot almost till the late afternoon and I use it EVERYDAY! There's always bound to be a few rotten apples in a barrel but don't throw out the rest. I'm buying one for my best friend for her birthday!
4,"Excellent brewing, love the thermal carafe","We have had ours for about nine months now. We just love it. We only use the 'grind' feature on weekends and for occasions, but this machine brews an excellent cup of coffee, and the keep warm thermal carafe works amazingly well, because I can take it downstairs with me while I am working and use it most of the day without it becoming thick syrup from overwarming. I also like the program settings, and the 1 to 3 cups setting is amazing.We especially appreciate the sturdiness of the carafe with multiple children in the family. We got tired of replacing broken glass carafes and the mess and risk."
2,Wish It Were As Good As It Looks,"I like the coffee this machine makes, and the ""grind and brew"" idea is a great one. Unfortunately the basket door pops open while brewing about every tenth time you use it, leaving a huge mess to mop up. As a result you can't leave it unattended.Cuisinart will tell you that this problem only occurs if the machine isn't properly cleaned, but that's simply not true; no matter how well or frequently you clean it, it will happen. They need to improve the latch, and isolate the grinder area from the steam; as it is now, the steam creates coffee ground muck that spreads throughout the machine.It's a shame that rather than make improvements to the design Cuisinart has decided to play the denial game, and blame customers for a well-documented design problem."
4,Product works as described,I was happy with the transaction: right product was shipped on-time and worked well.
4,Good til the end.....,"I was loving this DVD but then the very last episode wouldn't play! I couldnt believe it. So I dont know how it ended because the last episode Ascension wouldnt work. I sent my DVD back twice and it still didnt work, so unless you want the possibility of the last episode not working then I totally suggest you buy this DVD. Dont get me wrong all the episodes worked perfectly until the last one. But I do really love the videos."
2,Where do I begin?,"If it weren't for Ray Milland, I don't think I would've given this movie a chance, although I admit to seeing worse. This has got to be the weakest of the nature-against-man films which came out during the 70s. The frogs did nothing but ribbit and jump around the estate where most of the movie took place. I wasn't scared at all and I don't think the actors were, too. On the other hand, they may have been a little concerned about getting paid for their roles in this flick, because anyone can see it would've been an instant flop in the theaters.Ray Milland does a great job playing a grouchy old millionaire. Sam Elliott also did a fine job but it seemed these two had to carry the other actors performances just to make the movie bearable to watch.In the end, I recommend you avoid this one like the plague. However, if you love bad B-movies, then you shouldn't have any problems with this one."
2,insightful but outdated,"Hernton goes through the sex and power dynamics of blacks and whites in the US, male and female. He spends a chapter discussing each of the four. He argues that all parties are in some ways victims of racial stratification, to different degrees.My main criticism of this book is that it is outdated. It gives the reader an idea of how things were in the 1960s and previous decades. But it is not nearly as relevant today as some more recently-published works are."
3,"hit & miss, but for $4.99 not bad","I got it for $4.99, so not too much to complain about, a good value.However, why should I care what you did with your weenie, and how old you were, or what you do with it now?! Cut it off if you like, or take Viagra if it's too small. Then write a song about it.Too many noises, bees, fire engines, etc. I deleted half the songs, what's left gets 4/5, as it is the album gets 3/5."
3,great guitar riffs,"Could do without the special effects. The guitar work is incredible, but I found the synthesized voices distracting and annoying."
5,"Fine food, workable recipes","I purchased this cookbook because I cook and because there is a major Sarah McLachlan fan in my house. Okay, I like her, too. Anyway, the cook here is very happy with this book which relies on easy to prepare Mediterranean style recipes. The recipes are courtesy of the chef who catered Sarah's band on the Lilith Fair tour out of a tiny mobile kitchen. If he can do it, so can those of us with real kitchens. Many recipes are vegetarian with the occasional dairy or fish ingredient. Many are also low-fat. All are gorgeous, satisfying and should suit most tastes. I am envious of the fact that Sarah was backstage eating this great food while I was in the audience, restricted from 3 p.m. until midnight to eating what was sold ""in the venue."" Note to future festival organizers: some of us don't do fries, nachos with orange cheese, hotdogs and funnel cakes (I attended Lilith in central Pennsylvania). Some of us like vegetables, just like Sarah."
5,Read it about every four years,"This book is wonderful to me, to the extent that I don't understand some of the tepid reviews. I get something new out of it every time I pick it up, about every 4 years. It is completely from the perspective of a small girl until she is around 14ish. I think, I'm remembering that right. Unless you have lost touch with how you saw the world during those ages - realizing certain things about human nature for the first time- you will like this book."
4,A must read for anyone interested in the middle east,"Mr. Kaplan does an excellent job of pulling together information, quotations, and raw data from numerous sources to paint a compelling picture of the forces that shaped this mysterious, interesting, and oft-misunderstood region.More balanced than one would expect for a book with this title, Mr. Kaplan nicely straddles the line between fact and commentary, with only a couple times succumbing to interjections of personal opinion. However, without such points, a rather dry, far less thought-provoking, piece of academia would have resulted.A book guaranteed to broaden the knowledge of anyone interested in this fascinating part of the world."
3,Review by an Arabist,My father was an Arabist and is one of the people covered in this book. He reviewed the book at the time of it's publication. I will merely point to that review: [...]
1,City Planner Gives This Book a Failing Grade,"This book is illogical to the point of being absurd! For this ""rating of cities"" book to be truly useful, the cities or metropolitan areas need to be categorized by total population. Such as, Small Metropolitan Statistical Areas: 100,000 to 400,000; Medium MSA: 400,000 to 1,000,0000; Large MSA: 1,000,000 to 3,000,000 and Very Large MSA 3,000,000 or more. This is because many of the categories on which these MSA are being rated are affected by the size of the population of the metropolitan areas. Therefore, cities or MSA with similiar population ranges should be compared and rated for a valid comparison."
5,Book overview,"I bought the book for class. Amazon sold it to me way cheaper than my campus bookstore. I am getting a lot of use out of it, for my photography class. Great recomendation!"
4,Great Quality,Great quality of book for a really good price! Had no issues what so ever from the buyer and i received exactly what was advertised
2,Water and oil dont mix...,"I usually like burt's bees products, but someone should have told them water and oil don't mix....this is an oil-based shampoo that won't mix in your wet hair when you're shampooing! It just glops out!Come on Burt...this and banana-smelling hand lotion?! What's going on in Maine?"
5,Sam Swope's book - - - Gotta Go Gotta Go - - - is wonderful,I love Gotta Go Gotta Go. The books brings laughter and joy to children. I look forward to reading it to my children and grandchildren. Congratulations Sam Swope!!
4,Good Stuff,Fits well.Good Quality.Only complaint is the stitching in the logo.If you want an adjustable cap for any MLB teamthen you will be happy with the pinch hitteradjustable cap.
3,Good cap but not wool as advertised,"Nice cap. Advertised as wool but actually 100% polyester. Disappointing if you planned, as I did, to wear this in winter. Pity."
5,Great table... but,"Great table... but cheaper elsewhere. I purchased the exact table and the matching stools at Linens and things for a lot cheaper. I posted the same review under the stools section, because I want the potential buyers to get the same great deal as I did. I love the set. It's elegant and sturdy. Very happy with my purchase. Target needs to lower their price to keep the customers happy!"
4,Many words missing,"This book is a fantastic idea and has many useful synonyms. You can look the words up in Arabic or English which saves times. The author also puts each of the synonyms into sentences which is very useful. If you want to use this book to look up words as you read newspapers, novels, or other printed and broadcast media, it's less useful. It seems as though everytime I look up a word, it's not in this dictionary. This book is a good resource....just don't expect it to have most or all of the words you are seeking."
1,Not the book to help you overcome anger because you were wronged,"I was looking for a book to help me overcome anger that was caused due to another persons unkind actions. This book did not help me resolve my anger and I realized that I needed more direction than just mindful breathing, walking and listening. With additional research, I discovered that I really needed a book to step me through the forgiveness process so that I could release my anger. If you also need to forgive(not forget or justify their actions) so that you can move forward with your life, try The Art of Forgiving by Lewis B. Smedes. It will step you through the process."
4,anger,If you want to lessen the effects of anger and rage it is a good place to start.It is helping me.
5,Life Changing for Me,"I bought this book after realizing that I don't handle anger well. I had read some of Thich Nhat Hanh's other works a few years back, and had really enjoyed him...but unfortunately I had forgotten what I had learned. The message is the same simple message... but it's a simple message that works. I noticed that on days that I listened to the book (bought the book on tape as the store was out of the hard cover) on the way to work, I was much calmer. For me, it's help me to realize that a little wisdom each morning helps--so I draw on Thich Nhat Hanh's works, The Big Book of Jewish Values, and the Qur'an. Buy this book. It may be life changing."
5,this book is from god's hand,"The money spend by buying this book will save you 100 or 1000 times of the value of the book. Because due to anger, we go to court, we take revenge, we get sick, we try to escape from reality and spend lot of money."
4,Lugg Rules!,"True this is the first book where Campion takes center stage. Here his wit, calm under fire, and deviousness are firmly established. For me, even better is the development of Magersfontein Lugg as a subtle ex-thug.Lots of sneaky twists and turns in the story. In the end Campion, as often happens, succeeds in spite of himself.I do not understand the previous comment about Black Dudley and Mystery Mile being the same story. The former opens in a country manor, the latter on a transatlantic voyage. I can't think of single character other than Campion who appears in both stories. Printing error?"
5,This movie will never get old.,I just saw this movie for the first time about a year ago. I must have watched it at least 100 times and every time is like the first time. The characters are so lovable it's impossible to not like this film. This movie could cheer up even the saddest person.I reccomend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy. I do so cause it's the best I've seen and I've seen em all.
3,i like it,"really weird, silly movie with some great dialogue. i like it, but i dont know anyone else who does tho"
1,An unfunny waste of time,"Dan Zukovic, the filmmaker, thinks he is some kind of Jim Jarmusch here. But let me tell you, Dan Zukovic is no Jim Jarmusch. Never mind the ""plot."" There is no humor here. And the girlfriend of the lead character is simply annoying. Mark Ruffalo went on to some good roles after this, however. There are very long moments of no dialogue, and lots of attempts at creating some kind of moody meaning out of the vapidity here. I hope this didn't cost much to make because whatever was spent, was wasted."
4,Hell Freakin' Yeah,"Came a little late after smash, but the effort shows. In tracks like Change the World, you get the true meaning of the Offsprings punk attitude. In my personal favorite, Gone Away, you get the feelings of a guy who lost so much when he lost his girl(maybe a family member). Combined with a blistering, heart-filled tune, It is a monster hit. The rest of the songs on the CD tend to be really upbeat, and if you're looking for a really good record to buy, this is it."
5,The Best Offspring CD,"WHat does it matter what the critics think? My friends and I listened to this and it is EASILY the best. I mean, the other 4 are really good but every song on this album is great! Buy this one!"
4,This was a surprise,I am not a hug fan of the Offspring anymore but i do believe this is probably their best album. It was a fantastic major label debut which didn't really have the sales that the label probably hoped and not the hits they probably figured the Offspring could produce. this is a real dark and interesting album and musically it sounds a little more mature than Smash but not too much. This is the most mature and consistent the Offspring have ever sounded. I think that if you're getting into thwe offspring this is a must but start with ignition and smash first and stop at ixnay which is their last stab at anything good.
4,Great Underrated CD,"After Americana, everyone was expecting another great CD from The Offspring. This was the result. In my opinion, a great CD, but no one thought of it like that then. Some songs such as ""Me and My Old Lady"" and ""Don't Pick It Up"" differ from the usual fast paced punk of the old CDs, but make it work. ""Leave It Behind"" is a fast, hard hitting song that ends far too soon to get into it. And those aren't even the singles. All in all, it's a great CD. Go buy it."
4,Good follow up to Smash,"This album is good album to follow Smash. I'll agree with people who say that their sound changed with Americana, then Conspiracy and Splinter. I like Americana thru Splinter, but I love the sound of Offspring, Ignition, Smash, and Ixnay better. Although I dont think this was better than Smash, it's still a kick*ss album!"
4,"Being positive is so uncool, except when u review this cd","this is a pretty damn good cd, i wish i never gave it away. i was a huge offspring fan during my 8th, 9th ,and high school years. but now im really not into them anymore. a little while ago i started downloading the offspring and i was like ""why did i give away ixnay on the hombre""? that was a bad move because i really like a lot of the songs on this cd, and especially Smash. (I gave Smash away to). My favorite songs on this cd are Mota, Cool To Hate, I Choose, and Gone Away. If you like this I also recommend Smash and Conspiracy of One. Skip Americana its to pop/punkish for me. Anyway the Offspring are a good band and they sound even better live, so just buy this damn cd already!"
5,Great Album,"This is a really good Offspring Album (not as good as Smash, but not many albums are). I think most of the songs are really catchy and good. Cool to Hate is my favorite/most fun song on the album, and Gone Away is a just a great song plain and simple.Sometimes I forget how much I really liked The Offspring when I was younger, but whenever they come on my Ipod, I remember all the good times I have had to their music."
5,Love SCC!,"And to have the piano music to his amazing songs has been really fun! The arrangements are simple enough to sightread, but do not sound simple."
4,"Kirk and Farrah, together at last ( with a robot and Harvey Keitel)","Probably one of the more under rated sci-fi movies, this one has remained in my memory for years. Thank you Amazon for giving me the chance to see it again. Kirk is muscular,albeit aging. Farrah is gorgeous and Harvey is young. Kind of a simple plot, Harvey comes to the isolated space station where Kirk and Farrah have established a sort of Eden with their little dog. Harvey and the robot he's transporting there, arrive like the proverbial serpent altho with a lustful twist for the lovely Farrah. As can be imagined, things don't end well. This movie deserves more attention than it received at it's debut."
3,Why Bother Including a Ball???????,We just purchased this for my 3 year old daughter and I was very dissapointed when we opened it. The ball was so small and flimsy that we had to purchase another one. The goal itself seems to be ok although the net is stretched very thight causing the ball to bounce back out. Hopefully it will stretch out over time. My daughter did enjoy it after we purchased a real soccer ball. They should include a normal size ball or sell this as a goal only!!!!!!
1,I can't get past page 5!,"As a person who has been living with gluten intolerance (celiac disease) for more than two decades, I just can't tolerate the rudeness of my disease being joked about. We who have celiac disease must ""put up with that gluten crap"" every single day, for the rest of our lives!"
4,Fine--I will tell you how to put it on,"Mine had instructions but I still couldn't figure out how to put it on the bike. They used words I wasn't familiar with and no pictures. Hello Schwinn there are females out there in the world who install these things too! So I searched ""how to install a bike water bottle"" and that is how I found out. You need an Allen wrench. I had to google an image of an Allen wrench to figure out what it was. Then I was ready! Use the wrench to remove the screws that are already on your bike, then place the cage and screw them back in those holes. Duh, easy if they would just explain in English! If you don't already have screws on your bike, then I guess you use the items that come in the package. Good luck!"
4,a must for line managers,"the book is a fantastic way to explain the nuts and bolts of a business to a line manager. the line manager often does not see the enterprise/business objective of a manufacturing unit, especially in the indian context. an excellent gripper because it relates to the unit called family which too has a goal."
3,Gives good idea about basics of COBOL/400,"It's a good book for beginers want to learn COBOL/400; lack of ILE concepts, which are common in use on AS/400."
2,The Wisdom of This Crowd,The fact that most reviews of this book are positive prove the author wrong.
1,Utter B.S.,"The idea that the masses make more good decisions than the minority in areas such as finance, especially the stock market, is so ludicrous that it does not deserve comment. Has Surowiecki ever heard of Vilfred Pareto and his 80/20 principle, also called the Vital Few vs. the Trivial Many?"
5,Groups of People are Smart!,"This author has done an outstanding job of proving his thesis that groups of people are smarter than the smartest person in the group. The book touches on markets, juries, and economics, and many more topics, furthering his main point. This book will persuade the reader that experts and loners do not make the best decisions, but groups of informed people do."
1,Too Tedious For Me,"OK, crowds are wise - I get it - but, I do not feel much wiser after reading this book. I was thinking that the way that Mr. Surowiecki was making his points was Malcolm Gladwell-esque then I noticed that Surowiecki also is at The New Yorker - I guess they all write books in this style now. This one was too tedious for me and I could not finish it."
2,"Starts Good, then Falters . . .","The first few chapters are a revelation, which state the argument of the book clearly, concisely and convincingly, but the book goes downhill from there. It is argued that the great inventions and innovations were made by individuals, and next, it is the crowd that supposedly makes the right decisions. Outbursts against large corporations have no reason to be in this book, and just dilutes the message. Reconsidering the excellent presentations of the weight of the ox and the fall in the price of Thiokol after the Challenger explosion, there are not enough of such examples to assure that these phenomena were not a coincidence. Also, the book should have an index. Over-all, this could have been a much better work."
1,Don't waste your time,"The title of this book says it all. The book mostly proves the opposite. There are a few cases where the author does demonstrate the wisdom of crowds but mostly it shows the stupidity of so called crowds (the author considers some really small groups as crowds). You are drawn in by a couple of actual examples of groups doing some amazing things. He mentions some interesting markets where people buy shares concerning elections and which prove to be rather more accurate than polls in the end. He mentions a case where a submarine was lost and an individual pulls together a diverse group (not much of a crowd), each of whom guesses where the sub is and on the average they come within a few hundred yards. Most of the rest of his examples are not only weak but prove the converse. Like I said don't waste your time reading this garbage."
1,"Doesn't know the meaning of the word ""wisdom.""","The author writes a book on the erroneous concept - probably because he is unable to adequately determine and correctly define ""wisdom"" in his concept. ""The wisdom of the crowds."" more accurately titled should have been the ""The forces of popular opinion."" There is no real ""wisdom"" in the book. He fails to acknowledge the contradictions of his title and the entire concept - individuals who have advanced far beyond the crowd, their peers and all current paradigms - da Vinci, Columbus, Gallilleo, Darwin, Einstein, and many others that didn't listen to and were far wiser than any crowd. If the ""crowd"" truly had exceptional wisdom - then there would be no consultants and no distinctive terms like ""wise men."""
4,Fast-Food for Thought.,"I give the book 4 stars because it stimulates your thinking NOT because its thesis is correct; it isnt. The book is filled with many examples of how groups fail.A better thesis would be: Groups function best in situations where there is little or no change and life is simple. Groups are status quo animals. Surowiecki misses the boat when he assigns intelligence to information that is clearly statistics. Information isnt intelligence. A group is a collection of life forms without a collective intelligence.Surowiecki alludes to the influence of leaders but never explores just how influential leaders are in shaping the actions of groups.But the bottom-line is, I'll buy the book for my library."
2,Incoherent,"In the first half of this book the author seems to be on to something, but the second half is incoherent.The error the author makes is being too inclusive. He wants to shoehorn everything into a single theory. But things don't work that way. Different groups of people organized in different ways behave differently. The stock market is not the same as an open source project, just because a lot of people participate."
5,Poetic and lyrical,"I can not deny that Alamut is a fascinating historical novel but it is also so much more. It is a hauntingly eloquent work that combines poetry and prose in perfect harmony without being heavy handed or prolix. Enrapt by the story, I was transported by the language. Alamut was easily one of the most beautifully written and articulately translated books I have ever read."
4,A small general guide,"The title of this book is a lot larger than its contents. It actually consists of small essays on and examples of various qualities of Literature, such as Imagery, Diction, Rhyme, Rhythm, Poetic Thought, Feeling, Diction.It also contains an appendix of passages for comparison and appreciation, which appear in pairs.It is possible to learn from each of the chapters of the work, but do not expect definitive or comprehensive coverage of the subjects in question."
4,Great Power supply,"I have two of these attatched under my PedalTrain Pro pedalboard. The Voodoo Pedal Power 2 is nice and light, and powers up to 8 pedals, and if you get a 1 spot, or a multi daisy chain, like a Godlyke, you can power more then that out of one plug in. Great power supply, but a little pricey, so watch out if your on a budget."
3,VooDoo Pedal Power 2 Plus,Very nice piece of gear except I couldn't use it with my setup. If you're into many of the high end and so-called boutique pedals beware- many of them have Voltage and MilliAmp requirements that don't match well with the outputs on this unit. So unfortunate because I liked it.
4,Yet to sellout..,"taking back sunday is a reallly good band.....their lyrics are easy for most teens to relate to and its just good.... yeah i would reccomend incubus, this day forward, and dashboard confessional"
1,That rating should really be ZERO!,This Band blows my ass!!! When the singer figures out how to sing a note let me know then i'll give their sorry ass another listen!!
1,utter garbage,"If you are a fan of weak, contrived, radio rock and have just enough pride to fancy yourself ""punk"" or ""emo"" or whatever Hot Topic is selling this week, then this album is for you.And I hope you can feel yourself dying slowly when you listen to it. I know that I sure did.What a waste of perfectly good plastic and paper to release this album."
5,Tell All Your Friends About TBS!,"This a great album that's filled with lots of emotion. Most of the album is centered around the lead singer's relationship with his ex-girlfriend, so if you're experiencing heartbreak this is the soundtrack to your next pout-fest. The twin vocals of Adam Lazzara and John Nolan (no longer a member of TBS) are phenomnal and breath-taking. They explore friend betrayal on ""There's No 'I' in Team"", and acholohalism on ""Ghost Man on Third"". If you're into The Used or Thursday, you'll like TBS. They don't really scream a whole lot, but there are some well placed screams on ""There's No I in Team"", ""Timberwolves at NJ"", and ""The Blue Channel"", also at the end of ""Ghost Man"", you can feel the raw pain Adam is feeling when he screams ""THIS IS WHAT LIVING LIKE THIS DOES!!!!!!"" Great album, guys. Can't wait to see 'em this year at warped. I'm Out!"
1,so bad,"this band is horrible, there basicly dashboard confessional(horrible) and thursday(horrible) combined...so basically there just horrible. Go listen to nirvana, or CKY, if you want to listen to good music, not this crap."
2,great production and engineering?,"I'm not going to say much about this album music-wise, other than it was your typical modern rock album with one amazing song, one or two decent ones, and a bunch of repetitive material inbetween.However, my biggest problem is about how everyone raves about how good the production/engineering is... yet whenever the lead vocals come in there is a high pitched squeal. It gets pretty annoying whenever I do listen to songs from this album, and it's just not something I can overlook no matter how great of a job they did with the rest of the album."
4,"great cd , but one question","It took me some time to catch on, but within the last yeah i bought this cd. I reallllly like this album and most of the production is pretty good..But here is a question about something i've noticed.On various spots on the cds, especially during backup vocals, there is like a highpitched constant hiss type sound. I am not sure what caused this flaw and ive noticed it when listening to the cd on various stereos.it happens many times on the album. If you are not familiar with it, one good example to listen for it is on track 2, when the female vocals come in shortly before the line ""You've got me...""I just find it annoying and also strange that it is out there on the actual finished album. I also wonder if all versions of it sound this way and if the band has ever been asked or commented about it.I find this realllly annoying, esp the first time I listened to the cd, but I am over it now. Just wondered if anyone ever noticed this or thought about it."
1,IF ONLY I COULD GIVE IT 1 STAR,I'M SO SAD BLAH BLAH BLAH MY 9TH GRADE GIRLFRIEND JUST BROKE UP WITH ME BLAH BLAH BLAH I HAVE NO MONEY TO GO TO ABERCROMBIE BLAH BLAH BLAH MY MOMMY AND DADDY WON'T LET ME DRIVE THEIR BMW BLAH BLAH BLAH!STOP WHINNING JERK!!
5,Great CD,I first heard Taking Back Sunday this summer with their newer CD New Again which I fell in love with. Then I bought their other CDs and fell in love with those too. I like all the songs on this CD.
4,"LaCie HDD lives up to it's reputation: when it works, it works well; when it doesn't, it's garbage","I have a 250 GB HDD of the same make/model and I haven't had problems with it, despite other negative reviews. I purchased the 500 GB with an ever expanding digital library. The first model I received was lemon -- it wouldn't power up. I sent it back (had to pay for my own re-shipping), but was promptly sent a NIB replacement which has worked great. LaCie lives up to its reputation of a quality HDD with a sleek apparence, just as long as you don't get a lemon."
3,Good Drive but needs a FAN,"Nice drive, compact footprint, quiet, good price. But, like many cheap hard drives, this unit lacks a cooling fan. Heat is the major enemy of hard drives, and the lack of a fan means an increased failure rate and shortened life span.I opened up the case and found that the case was in fact made for a fan and has the appropriate mountings already included. Somebody saved a couple of bucks by leaving the fan out. Very disappointing.I bought a fan of the appropriate size from Digi-key and added it myself. Cost about $10 plus shipping. Now it's a decent drive."
3,"Lots of bang for the buck, but button often fails","I got this on sale for $99 and am happy with how much storage it provides for the money. However, it fails to power on about 75% of the time when I hit the power button, and the power light is tiny and on the opposite end of the drive, so you don't KNOW it's failed to power on. This gets frustrating and makes me less likely to use the unit. Also, be aware that the unit is not nearly as compact as the pictures make it look, because it has an external power supply. So if you intend to use this as a portable drive (as I did), you'll have to bind the supply to the top and deal with cables."
4,Lacie Porsche HD,"Fairly good price and good quality. Runs fairly hot (I could keep a somewhat warm coffee on it). Remember every 10 degrees hotter cuts the life by half. So I've been turning off the HD whenever it's not in use, which kind of messes up its autoplay that I've set for it. Unless, of course, I start the computer with the HD already on.11-17-08 - Recently I discovered that you SHOULD NOT turn this thing on while the computer is either booting up or logging in. My computer crashed/froze when I logged in and then hit the power button on the HD. Up 'till now, it's been working like a charm! I love it!"
1,"Poor performance, now a doorstop and zero customer service",Lacie is the hands-down worst customer service for computer related products. I have had three of their hard drives and all have failed before they were two years old. I have bought Buffalo and ReadyNAS and been very satisfied with both the product and customer service. Lacie makes very good doorstops not computer equipment.
3,Looks great but was too loud for me.,"After reading all the reviews I decided to try this LaCie drive. Because my computer is in my bedroom, the quiet factor was critical to me. I bought this drive because enough reviews described it as quiet, and because it looked so great. Well, it's true, the design is great. It is small and sleek looking, very unobtrusive.However, the one I received was LOUD. When the power is on, the fan runs and it makes a very loud humming/whirring noise, before the USB cable is even plugged into the computer! I was very dissatisfied with this loudness so I exchanged it for a Western Digital MyBook Essential. The WD drive is virtually silent when at rest, and the noise it makes when active is the noise the LaCie drive makes while at rest.I can't comment on how well the LaCie drive runs because I returned it due to the noise factor."
4,Excellent Drive for the money,"I now have 3 of these hooked up via USB 2.0 to my media PC at home, and they have been flawless for the past year. To be fair, I rarely have any more than 1 of them at time on out of fear of overheating since they're all in an enclosed space with the PC and a PS3 (those run really hot!), but thus far I've had no issues at all. Good sleek design that appears stackable, but I wouldn't do that, again out of overheating concerns. Would be nice to have a desktop rack to mount these on."
2,Familiar character,"I'm tired of these effete, English, dissolute, and decaying narrators (e.g., The Sea, The Sea; Cast in Doubt; The Book of Evidence; etc.). If the movie industry decided to adapt all of these novels, Alan Rickman wouldn't have a moment's rest. Strangely, this novel, for a change, is written by a yank."
2,"Good art, but why is it still on my shelf?","Luis Royo has talent. You would know, or else why check out the reviews to 'double-check'? His finished pieces are amazing, as you can see on covers of his books, but is it worth getting? Hmm... Well I bought it and liked it for the first 5 minutes, but afterwards regretted owning it.It's a thin book without much paintings. You see sketches and ideas that was flowing through him at the time, but not much to be satisfied. It's not something you would carry and impress others with.Just be prepared to be impressed and ending up ebaying it."
4,Buy one and you would believe......,"There may have some negative review for this product, but I believe that was just few bad cases. I think that this hard drive was very easy to configure, and it has been very reliable. I can always rely on it to safely store all the preciouse data. It satisfied my needs perfectly and worked great with my computer and transfers music and picture files real quick."
3,Texas Rich,The book I received as very old. Pages are quite yellow and are fragile. I would try to be more selective when choosing a volume for5 purchase in the future.
5,"Desperate Housewives, The Complete First Season","Really good. The product came in well packaged and on time. Every DVD work well, as well. I recommend it to anyone."
4,Pleased,The product came in good condition. There were no scratches and the seller was honest about the product.
1,Aaron Spelling?,"For Pete's sakes, it's Aaron Spelling all over again. The portrait of living in suburbia is just ingenious. All those beatiful faces and bodies living on the same block? Where does the show take place again?The show is generic, generic, generic. Overblown supermarket aisle publication crap. The messages could not be more recyclable nor superficial. Some people have compared this show to Sex and the City (which is not precisely a shrine of depth in itself) and it's unfair to do that because it lacks all of that show's acidic wit and insider humor. This is just a bad soap opera with cheap gags. To the show's credit though, they did manage to feature some impressive guest stars to appear (e.g. Marlee Matlin)."
5,"great show, i'm addicted","i know i probably shouldn't be watching this, because the stereotypical guy should not be watching this. for some reason. but whatever, i like it and i cant wait for it to come out on dvd."
3,Defective Switch,"The delivery was fast, but the factory packaging was inadequate to protect the pump. Amazon packaging also very poor packaging for heavy the pump. The white float switch appears to be damaged during shipment and won't turn on when the water is above the pump. Have to manually push the switch to turn the pump on. Awaiting for replacement from amazon. Very unsatisfied."
5,Heavy Duty Workhorse,"I purchased this pump to replace an identical pump that was around 6 years old. The older pump was not installed correctly, the previous owner had basically set the pump in a 5 gallon bucket, which caused the pump to short-cycle and run...A LOT.After I installed a proper sump and encapsulated my crawl space I went ahead and replaced the older pump with this new one, just as an insurance policy of sorts. The old pump was still going strong, but I didn't want to take any chances after spending the money to encapsulate.These seem to be great pumps, solidly built, and highly recommended by everyone who does crawl space work."
5,The Gold Standard,"I just replaced a 15+ year-old Zoeller with a brand new M57. The pump it replaced worked flawlessly for over 15 years in a sump pit in the back of my garage. I have used other sump pumps in other sump pits in my home, with nowhere near the service life of the Zoeller. From now on, it's only Zoeller pumps for me."
1,NOT worth the money!!!! Lasted only 6 months!!!,"Purchased and installed this pump after reading a lot of positive reviews on the internet, and paid quite a bit more than I can get a Rigid or Campbell/Hausefield one for locally at Lowes or Home Depot, figuring that it would last longer to make the extra money worth it. Well, was I wrong! Thank goodness I was home this afternoon and also purchased a water alarm at the same time. This pump completely failed after just over 6 months of what I would consider pretty ""light"" duty. We do not get much rain. It appears that the switch as failed because I don't hear the motor even try to run when I lift the switch arm. Based on my experience, I would definitely NOT recommend a Zoeller pump!!!"
5,Solid performer,"The pump is cast iron and has a heavy solid feel. More importantly, it works perfectly. Pretty quiet."
3,Rankin's weakest is still not that bad,"I have read all of Ian Rankin's works, mainly because I enjoy his writing style and his descriptions of Edinburgh and environs. This book is not one of his best from plot or suspense angle, however. If you are new to the Inspector Rebus series, I'd start with an earlier one like Knots and Crosses or Black and Blue."
2,A very disappointing read.,"When Flip Balfour disappears, the pressure is on to find out what happened to her. Flip is the daughter of a prominent London banker, so as with any high profile case, the police are under intense scrutiny, and there are many leads to follow. Add to this a tiny wooden coffin containing a doll found in a place called The Falls. The author started up several different storylines and never tied them together. The different storylines contained the same cast of characters, but there didn't seem to be any particular order or focus to the story. I found all the characters very dreary (including the protagonist and his comrades), which made for a very hard to read book. I've heard good things about this series, so if you haven't read any of the previous book in the series, I wouldn't suggest starting with this one."
3,"Neither difficult nor boring, but not what I expected either.","The saga of the Volsungs is a compound of old Norse lays. The first part tells the story of Sigurd's ancestry and of his quest to slay the dragon Fafnir. The second is very similar to the Nibelungenlied, with characters such as King Gunnar, Hogni and Brynhild.Once again, even though Odin, the Valkyries and other supernatural beings appear here and there in the first part, I was expecting this book to comprise much more Norse mythology, such as tales of Yggdrasil, Bifrost and Ragnarok. Maybe I should give a try to the Prose Edda?Anyway, it wasn't too difficult or boring, and of course it was nice to spots some of Tolkien's sources of inspiration."
4,Very nice tribute album.,"Bennett's voice is ageless, in fact he sounds more meaningful at 70, then he did in the 1950's, when he was a nervous young performer pernouncing Darn That Dream is Darn That Drum. Anyway this tribute is very nice, although it would have been better without the duet with Holiday and the srings, A trio setting thoughout would have been perfect, however this album is worth picking up."
4,Great choice of book for general information,The book provides a good genralised outline of the processes that human remains go through. It is a wonderful starting point for the examination of death and burial. However if a more detailed account is required it will not suffice. As such it is a stepping stone to a more in depth investigation of death and burial. It tells you where to start and what avenues to take in your knowledge quest. It is not a book clouded by other issues.
1,"Makes Me Ashamed to Be ""Green""","Thermageddon is a sterling example of the elitism that makes so many people despise environmentalists. I could rant about Robert Hunter's racism and sexism and the hysterical pseudo-science he resorts to in this book, but I'll just say this: according to Thermageddon, Hunter has at least 3 children and those children are reproducing as fast as they can. If Hunter believes that he and his offspring have the right to bring as many children into this overcrowded world as they please, how dare he tell the suffering masses of China they can't enjoy air conditioning or automobiles?Apocalyptic weather forecasts like those in Thermageddon may sell a lot of books, but they miss the point. Human beings can survive drastic climate change. What we can't survive is the destruction of the oceans, the loss of biodiversity and fresh water resources and 10 billion people on this planet..."
4,A sequel actually worth watching.,"If you saw Funny Girl and loved it, then you have to follow up with it's sequel. Although not as captivating, with all the extra stage productions and musicals by people other than Fanny, the sequel does justice to the plot and the characters."
2,Pinstripe Scroll Decal,"I love how the look on the sheet, and the size is good, my only problem is that once applied to my motorcycle, the ""clear"" boarder around the stripes isn't so clear. If I had known that it would stand out so much I wouldn't have purchased this decal at all."
1,HORRIBLE,"All the poxy putty stuff (wood, metal, pipes) Are ridiculous. the only thing it sticks too is your fingers. the smell is awful and no matter how much soap it doesnt come out for a couple days. i strongly dont recomend it."
2,O.K.,"Some of the songs were good...I went to the WMC Party @ Mansion this year and left within the hour, the music is O.K. not a big fan, had a better time and heard better DJ's @ other venues."
4,Pink Golf Clubs,I bought this set primarilly for the fact they are pink. They were given to my neice with the hope that because they were pink they would encourage her to use them. So far so good. She loves the fact they are pink and has hit them twice so far on an indoor range.
3,"Wrong Internal Diameter States 1.5"" but both were 1 3/8""","Wrong size, on both items not 38mm but 35mm and had to be returned. It looks sturdy and came with wood screws."
3,Archaic and impenetrable,"I'm sure this book contains many insightful teachings, unfortunately, I couldn't understand any of them. The language is archaic at best, which is not surprising since these writings are supposedly over 2000 years old. I gave up half way through. I'm sure this book has inspired many people, and I'm not taking anything from that, what I'm saying is that this book just didn't offer me any help. But just because *I* couldn't find anything of value here, doesn't mean others won't.This book is a part of the AMORC library - ""Ancient Mystical Order Rosea Crucis"" (The Rosicrucians) - and can therefore be seen in line with their philosophy. The Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, is superb in their perspective on mysticism; they really know what they're talking about. It is claimed that this publication is the first time these specific manuscripts have been allowed to be seen in the West and that the Dalai Lama himself approved this translation."
3,Delta is better Deal and Quality,"I had the oportunity to test both of these lathes and , what is better about the Delta is the Belt access door location Jet was a pain to change speeds, also smoother running. AND less money to boot!"
1,What's going on?,"A few month's ago this item was available for a pre-order. Well, I preordered it, waited, and received a message saying that this book went out of print and that it is know longer available. Either something is wrong with this website or marvel decided to stop the series."
4,A Rare Find....,"The Item if like all its predecessors is amazing. the whole Marvel RPG univers is great! But nobody can review this book because It doesn't exist. After speaking with many people and doing the same myself, I have scowered high and low. This book was announced, then some how went ""out of print"" on the opening day. If anybody finds a copy of this book or were to get it please tell everyone!"
1,"To big, battery drains fast!","The compaq Ipaq is high teck gadget, but if you are planing to carry it in your pants pocket for daily use, you will get sick of it.. And plus that the battery drains too fast! Imagine beinging in the middle of your day, looking for a phone number in the street and your pocket pc runs out of battery... That really disturb me.. It happend to me a few times, I had to go back to my old palm pilot Vx, and is serving with no problems..."
1,Compaq 3135,"Here are the features that did not work right out of the box:1. Power. It will not accept a charge. I left it plugged in, turned off, for 72 hours and the little amber light blinked all the while. When I unplugged it and tried to turn it on, the device was dead. I've tried many variations on that routine, all with the same result. It will work only while plugged into a wall socket.I've searched the documenation, thinking maybe there's another part needed. I found no answers. It's certainly not portable in this condition.2. Connectivity. The USB hookup is extremely unreliable. I can get it to hold for only a few seconds at a time. It is impossible to synchronize it with either the desk top computer or with an on-line source such as Audible.com.3. Memory. I tried 16MB, 64MB, 128MB. The device would recognize none of them.4. Documentation. The help files on the CD are useless. They address none of the issues the device's defects have raised.That's about it. It's very shiny."
3,compaq p.c. user,I purchased the original compaq last year but unfortunately lost it. I since have a visor but still felt the loss of my original compaq. I decided not to spend over $500 to replace the color one and was told by a friend that they have a monochrome version. It has everything that I am use to except the color is very difficult to see. The glare and the greyish tone make it not as user friendly as the visor or palm brands. Too bad! I truly wanted to give a rave review but if you can't see clearly what can you rave about?
1,No Support,"The device itself has all the features I wanted but after connecting it to my Host computer found that it would not communicate with my ISP. Contacted Compaq and they advised me that the problem was with the software provided by AvantGo. AvantGo does not provide telephone tech. support so have been trying to resolve my problem via e-mail and internet without any cooperation from AvantGo. If you are a computer tech, this is a nice little device but don't buy it unless you think you can solve your problems by yourself."
4,"Fun Read, Spooky Too","I read this book while on a week long road trip. Had a great time with it. Works well as a local history book while telling some of this country's most known folk-tales. Spooky stuff! I especially liked ""The Stranger"" story in West Virginia."
4,Interesting Examination of the Conflict,"Seward evaluates the conflict from the perspective of a few of the participants and observers. The perspectives of the Earl of Oxford and Margaret Beaufort are especially effective. The book is effective in helping you understand the changing loyalties and underlying basis for the conflicts.For a better reading of the events prior to the battles between Lancaster and York, I suggest reading Seward's other book ""The Hundred Year's War."" Also read Weir's ""Wars of the Roses"" for some details that Seward doesn't cover. Seward's book is about people and how they were affected by the war. There are better books out there that give details that this book doesn't dive into. However, there are some unique perspectives in this book that are worth examining and effectively put you back in the 15th Century where the events were occuring."
3,Body Wisdom helps,"I wasn't expecting what this book held, however it was really useful and good to read. The stories of what the author had been through were really shocking but it was amazing to read about how she healed herself."
2,Rather low rent,I was disapointed to find no Bruce music to be heard anywhere in this program. The interviews are ho-hum at best and include people of very little substance who offer nothing of note who maybe sat behind him in school or heard him play once. The quality is low and strikes me as a high school production rather than a full blown documentary. The interview with Bruce is not done by the producers but is file footage of a mid to late 70's Bruce.There are many great resources for Bruce material out there and I recommend the Marsh Bio. Pass this one by.
2,BORING,"It was a suggested reading from school...I read it with my 8 year old. Seemed very ""wordy"" and was boring."
4,Baseball and Sportmanship,"The Hit-Away Kid by Matt Christopher is a story about baseball and tell telling the truth. Barry, the main character, is a good baseball player who stretches the rules a bit. He learns that he is not perfect at everything and this makes him feel better about playing baseball. We recommend this book a lot."
4,A roller coaster of surprises,"Just when you thought the craziness finally came to an end and you'd get an explaination on why Fowles was putting this character through this emotional tug-of-war, he takes the story to another level. It started off slow but I found it very entertaining always wondering how I'd react if this was being done to me."
1,Beware!,"This is a cruel book.Both the protagonist, Nickolas, and I could have stopped the cruelty. He, by tuning away from the masque run by Conchis and his sadistic band, and I, by putting the book away. But, driven by our own hubris, we didn't stop it, and, in the end we were both utterly debased.Was the debasement worth it? Nickolas seems to have conceded that it was, but I'm not so sure. Some days I think it was and some days I think it wasn't. That uncertainty is the essence of the problem with recommending or not recommending this emotional battering ram of a book.If you're a detached, critical, and analytical reader this book won't harm you, and you may even be able to give it an objective rating. If you're an emotional reader (like me) however, all bets are off. The book will probably hurt you, and you will either hate it, or, in some perverse way, love it.I'm giving it no stars today, just because I'm very angry with the book at the moment."
5,"If you like Borges and Marques, you will love the Magus","The Magus is one of the best piece of literature I have read in a long time. In fact, I was sad that I let it sit in my library for such a long while. Through mysterious events that take place in an exotic Greek setting, the book addresses the complexity of human psychology and the mere search for one's identity and meaning. It delves into deepest insecurities and the casual ugliness in human nature. The book still haunts me back when I think about the plot and the events Nicholas Urfe finds himself in. I can not recommend it enough."
2,"starts strong, ends lame","The best thing I got from this book is some insight into the psyche of a selfish guy...Not much else. The first third of the novel makes big promises which fall completely flat at the end. Fowles manages to escape giving the book a satisfactory conclusion, and it's obvious that the lack of an ending is more artistic inadequacy than artistic technique.The descriptions of the settings are good and have some atmosphere, but it isn't really worth reading for that alone."
2,A Psychological Mess,"""A man trapped in a millionaire's deadly game of political and sexual betrayal. . ."" What the hell are they talking about? The only thing trapped in this long-winded, slow-motion, so-called suspense novel is the reader! (Did I mention long-winded?) The reader, dragged through hundreds of pages of meaningless innuendo accompanied by pretentious pseudo-eroticism, cries out ""For the love of God, GET ON WITH IT!"" Perhaps the most entertaining bit of this 600+(!) page tome is the setting - mysterious, bucolic, etc., altogether well-chosen for what Fowles was (presumably) trying to achieve in his novel. Nevertheless, a good setting alone cannot rescue this overrated work."
4,Good Starting Point,"As a quick read with a number of interesting facts, this is a good introduction to food additives as well as nutrients. It could be construed as a dictionary but not as a reference. To be a reference, it needs a standardized format to ensure the same kind of information is provided for each item. To be a quick reference, it needs a comprehensive index. As a potential source, it also seems to lack authority when it fails to consistently cite sources and makes statements which appear subjective. I'm still looking for something of the nature of Rodale's Encyclopedia of Herbs."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"This book is less extensive than I had hoped. My mother is a lifelong resident of Jeffersonville, as was her father. Although the pictures and history are worthwhile, this should be broken into decades or expanded upon. Jeffersonville has a very rich history and this was more like a Cliff's Notes edition. There is so much more that could have been covered in this book. This was merely a taste."
2,"Picture is misleading, loose RCA ending","Image shows a 4 pack of these connectors but you only get ONE. Go with Q-see version of it, you get a 6 pack for only $2 more.This adaptor was kind of loose and I had to tape the RCA end to my other cable."
2,Artificial Flavor & Yellow 5?!,I prefer a more natural mustard. There is really no good excuse in my opinion to add yellow food coloring to mustard. Do I really need to see a bright yellow to help trick my brain for improved taste? I think not. I encourage you all to read up more on Yellow 5 before buying this product.
2,Great HD but NOT PORTABLE!!!!!!,"This is a great external hard drive but its NOT portable. Thats sad cuz I wanted one that was srtictly portable. I could have bought a bigger hard drive for the same price but I thought it was external.Great hard drive, quiet, easy to use but NOT portable."
3,Slow as cold molasses,"My 250 gig SimpleTech is still backing up 59.69 GB worth of data from my computer after 17 hours!!!! It is not Mac friendly. The useless backup software that came with it thinks my 120 GB hard drive on my computer is wanting to backup 843,128,844,732.05 GB worth of data. It comes with a wall-wart a/c cable and USB cable that's about 2 ft. longThe unit is heavy and bulky and slow, despite the sleek case. Shop around for something faster and smaller is my advice. I think the 3 stars I gave it are being kind."
3,"Plush Gun is Unique, Too Simple Light and Sound, Bad Battery Solution","I bought this plush laser gun and it's 2 companions in different designs and colors. They are nice and small and I love the plushness and the cute designs.Unfortunately, they use 3 cell batteries which can be as expensive to replace as the guns themselves. The desciption didn't list the battery type anywhere but the gun size could easily have accomodated AA or AAA batteries which would have been a much better solution. Since one of my guns arrived with dead batteries that was a big cost increase for that one gun - the replacement batteries were $9, but one-use AA's or AAA's would have been around $2 or rechargeables would be even cheaper long term.Finally, the lights and sounds advertised turned out to be 1 light and 1 sound. Very disappointing that it was not more dynamic and varied.Overall, I do love the design and I think its a cute and unique toy, even with the power and light and sound limitations."
5,I LOVE RYAN HE IS THE GREATEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I haven't read the book but Ryan Adams just played here in Charleston SC june 10th 2005 and he ROCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't wait until his next 2 CDS come out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not the worst..but not the Best.,"A big thing is that there is no dramatic fights that realy impress you.The hero is just to powerful he just snaps his fingers and POOF, blue sparks come from the enemy and it just vanishes.Realy that's what happens I'm not kidding.The story is strange but you can follow it.This anime has some nudity but quickly turns you off with a demon ripping a her arm off at the elbow.The ending also is strange and leaves you feeling unsatisfied and some what confused.On the good side it does have umm....a twisted strange plot(if you like that kind of thing.)and nice animation but you still cann't get into it very much."
2,label,labeled from white's side of play is finelabeled from black's side of play is incorrect.See labels in chess books.
4,Works well but the cover is delicate,"I have been using this calculator for a while and it works well. That being said, the cover snapped off at the hinges (I carry it in my purse). That doesn't bother me too much but if you are concerned about that, treat it very carefully."
4,Don't be tricked! It's only the first HALF.,"Quite honestly, when I ordered this DVD, I was expecting to get the entire season in one disk. However, Amazon made NO notes about that particular detail and it is only the first 19 issues. And as many others have said, the voices didn't seem right. But the more you watch it, the less annoying it gets. It seems the voice actors understand the characters on a level fans can relate to. I was one of those hoping for original voice acting, if only from a few original actors, but it just didn't happen. I'm not disappointed in this by any means. The art is beautiful, just as in the comics (as I own the first edition of each of the comics) and I think a great job was done animating the series. I would like to know when the second half is going to be released, because I can't wait to ""watch"" the rest of the season (even though I've already read it.)"
2,"This is meant to be read, not watched.","I loved all 7 seasons of Buffy. This should not be called season 8. It's annoying to watch and hard to follow. I expect so much more from Joss Whedon. I've only seen 1 episode... actually i am writing this as i am watching it. I'm going to pretend I never saw it. If you don't want the memory of the original show tainted, don't watch this."
5,"Huge fan of the series, this just keeps that going","I have followed Buffy since it originally aired on cable and have been re-watching my box sets for years. I was very pleased with this purchase, as it keeps the story going after Buffy has saved Sunnydale in season 7 and the new slayers have arisen. Joss Whedon does not disappoint!"
1,hate,i did not like this episode because i just dont like cartoon things and i just thought it was stupid.
4,Buffy is Buffy,"the comic illustrations are pretty and interesting, and there are a lot of lines that are great. The voices threw me off a little because I'm so very use to the actors that are suppose to say the lines. They were good but they just weren't good enough. There are a lot of arguments over whether this is cannon. Personally I couldn't care less. It has the wit and humor that Buffy fans love. the dramatic plot twists and appropriate character development. It's a good stop motion comic, and while there are things that seem a little off I thoroughly enjoyed it. The ending leaves something to be desired but it's not like the comics can't be read for the rest fo the story."
2,Ho Hum,"I expected more. There are a few songs that are worth listening to, but the rest just all sound the same. I was disappointed."
4,Great Mystery Writer,"Cannot get enough of Jane and her literate mystery books. Many times I am brought back to my days as a teen working in a Catholic rectory and the reality her characters display. Jane, if you're reading this, keep on keeping on. You are one of the few writers I have read that takes a leap and discusses serious issues in your book(s). You humanize your characters and culturize its inhabitants."
3,"It means well, but gets too silly and obvious","Sure I laughed, Joan Cusack was the best, and I realize that EVERYONE is stereotyped here, but Kevin Kline's fey gay characaterization really annoyed me after awhile. Overall the humor is too obvious and excrutiatingly mainstream. Not as funny as it was trying to be, and certainly not subtle or sophisticated. The final graduation scene was really over the top in embarrasment factor, and I found the ending was clearly made so as to ""offend"" the average mall walker.GLAAD, the gay antidefamation group puts this on its lest of ""10 best"" gay movies which is beyond me, as this is just too middle of the road.Of course, I guess there still is a need for a ""we're just folks"" movies like this, but given some of the distrubing comments I have seen here, it's probably just preaching to the choir."
2,not Kline's best work,"Although at times amusing, you may want to skip this film. While starting off funny, it quickly degenerates into a propaganda piece for the ""alternative lifestyle"" set."
2,Not quite that good,"In and Out is the type of film that has a hilarious premise but fails in its execution. This film could easily have had more hilarious situations had the director delved into the material more. There were some very funny scenes in the movie, but they were too little and too short. The main saving grace was the acting. It was absolutely superb, and Kevin Kline should have received an oscar nomination."
5,Lots of Laughs without Offense.,"This movie is a side splitter!! Most movies, after seeing them many times, just get a chuckle. Every time I watch this one, I have to use a pillow so my laughs don't wake the little ones!! My favorite part is when Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) listens to a self help tape to help him decide if he really is straight or gay. I can't honestly say that any actor in this flick gives a bad performance. Everybody is really funny!! Love it!!"
5,"The ""Go Ask Alice"" Of Out Time","This movie is not like any other. Because in other movies, people use drugs and you never actually get to see the real truth behind drug use and abuse. Every movie teaches the audience of how ""cool"" and fun drugs can be. But not one movie that I have been witness to has captured the reality of addiction and other possible problems you encounter when involved with drugs. This movie was great. Specially because, unlike fairy-tales, the main characters do not live happily ever after. It starts with three friends that are trying to make it in the city. I will not tell you the details but the ending you will never expect."
5,best movie ever made,"This is no doubt the best movie ever made the cinematography story, beauty,editing is a masterpiece.Not a day goes with out me thinking about it. It is good to finnaly see a movie out there about the truth and done so well in this style. I have seen this movie 5 times in the theatre and recommend it to anyone out there tired of all these blockbuster movies out there that bore u from the start. I cant wait to see what arofonsky has next""."
3,Overrated,"Ellen Burstyn shines in this disturbing film about the lives of four people and their addiction to drugs. The acting and writing is excellent, though this movie was a little too ""weird"" for my tastes. This film is very disturbing and well done, but I don't think it lives up to all of the praise it received."
5,Amazingly beautiful film,"Requiem is the best film that I have ever seen. It is a film of such power, and of such amazing beauty that to watch it is the same as to have your heart ripped out. Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director of incredible genius."
2,This wasn't that good....,"Unless you like movies that deal with just sex and drugs, then I recommend seeing something else. Yes this movie is dark, but that was the point, so I enjoyed that aspect of the film, and the ending was perect, but it just drug in to many places. See Pi instead, it is much better."
1,just another bizzare movie,Just another movie where the writer/director/producers are trying to pass off their bizzare nightmares as something meaningful. Wish I could give it 0 stars.
3,dvd,"i rated this a 3 because the quality and packaging was good , but the movie was lame, very boring."
1,Snore Fest,"I saw this film a while ago, and still have nothing good to say about it. I almost didn't bother even watching the whole thing, it had me yawning. The music is repetitive and annoying. The focus was on the character's downward spiral thanks to drug use, and didn't accomplish portraying the tragedy that is the death of dreams well at all. The characters failed to move me. It seemed to me they never had anything going for them to begin with, and thus not really anything to lose. It just seems like a film you'd show someone to scare them away from drug use."
1,Maybe this is not my type of movie,I feel that this is like a movie that was shot in the 80's. I don't know why but it seems old and past due for me. I have tried watching it on five occasions and have not gotten past the 25 minutes. Too bad. I expected more based on the reviews on here.
3,"Let's hear it for shock value!! (Or, let's not.)","I had high hopes for this film after seeing Pi. Jennifer Connolly, Marlon Wayans, and Ellen Burstyn did a more than decent job of acting. Not a very realistic story. Interesting, yes. Pleasant, no. Absurd may be the key word here. The score gets dull after a while. Just about the worst possible outcomes for all the characters. Highly recommended if you enjoy dread and hopelessness. If you buy or rent this, expect people including yourself to question your taste in film. Impatience with the plot is normal. Too long. Take it easy on the intoxicants during viewing."
5,something new each time,"I get new images each time I watch this movie. The way this Requiem for a dream was pulled together is beautiful, the alltered views in each scene made for a more exciting time, the story line scared me. I am not sure if this was ment to be a scary movie but it shows you a life not worth living. I believe the creaters of this movie many more amazing films to come, Keep up the amazing work. Abby, From Michigan"
3,Well Indeed,It is actually a nice experience wathcing this movie. I have had a chance of comparing this highly artistic movie with another one in terms of their approach to the issue of addiction. I came to the conclusion that it is really impossible to compare it with any other works.
1,So what?,"So we have another 'harrowing' film about drug addiction. Yeah we all know a small percentage of users end up completely destroying themselves. Yes, long term use of stimulants like diet pills and amphetamines leads to temporary psychosis. Let's see some films about the long, successful lives many addicts lead and here's a radical idea - how about showing the reality that the majority of drug users live long, happy, fullfilled lives? The movie is well acted and well executed, but it is a pretense and a distortion of reality which would be fine if it was openly so."
2,Like jabbing a needle into an open wound,"This film, in a word, sucks. For those of you who don't know, heroinwill consume your life. There, I saved you from having to endure theassault this film provides in the form of a two hour funhouse ride into the bowels of hell. If you enjoy watching people destroy themselves and have nothing better to do with your time then watch this movie; you're probably dead already anyway. Otherwise, treat yourself to an ice cream and forget about the fact that people make some dumb-ass choices that eventually lead to their demise. I've had more fun drilling holes in my toenail to relave the pressure after I dropped a pepsi on my foot. And all I wanted was a pepsi..."
4,excellent movie!,"amusing for sure but very sad, it starts out showing how much fun they were having getting high then how much it costs them. good movie, you almost experience the high with them."
1,Requiem for a Pleasant Time Watching a Film,"I haven't the slightest idea who this movie is supposed to be for. Do the actors do a good job? Yeah. Are there unusual special effects and neato cinematography? Yeah.Are these characters people you can relate to and care about?Nope.I've a feeling that if the director met people like these characters in real life, he wouldn't care about them either. He would exploit their pain instead."
4,"Disturbing, but very good.","ALL of the performances in this movie are EXCELLENT, especially Ellen Burstyn, who deservedly was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, 2000 (but somehow lost to Julia Roberts).The movie starts off light, but gradually builds into this living nightmare, complete with SPOILER ALERT arm amputations, sexual exploits, and electroshock ""therapy."" The whole amputation thing didn't really bother me, but seeing Ellen Burstyn getting SHOCKED simply for popping diet pills like candy did. I had NO idea that something that trivial could drive someone mad, and this madness would actually require that type of therapy, but my mother verified this information for me ... and that's because she herself went a little crazy on diet pills in her younger days.An eye-opening movie, to say the least, but ... if you're squeamish, WATCH OUT!"
4,Not Just a Movie About Drug Addicts,"This movie was EXTREMELY dark, gritty, scary, disgusting and yet I could not look away!This is just not some movie about drug addicts. It's about how things in our every day lives can be a drug... sex, power, food, money, social acceptance, and even television.I cannot say enough about ALL of the perfomances in the movie. ESPECIALLY ELLEN BURSTYN! She was so awesome in this movie and is probably the best thing I 've seen her in.Marlon Wayans is also a big surprise in the movie and really brought the character of Ty to life. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly also turn in fine performances although it is hard to feel any pity for either of them.The sound, lighting, direction, and basically all of the effects in the movie are haunting.This DVD has some really nice features and is well put together. ""The Requiem"" scene in the movie is brutally graphic. This film is certainly not for everyone... but I enjoyed it."
3,"interesting cinematography, weak story","I would recommend anyone to see this if simply for the visual aspects, but the story really boils down to, ""Don't do drugs, or THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!"" Not much more to the movie...And I simply cannot get over the fact that the when the people use heroin, their eyes DILATE! Did the director truely think he could put one over on the audience, or was he actually unaware of the fact that pupils constrict when someone uses heroin? Either way, this never should have happened, shame on him."
2,I can see how some would rate this a 5! Very Depressing!!!,I could easily give this film 5 stars. I didn't hate it and I didn't like it. I love horror and comedy. I never liked serious movies about the tragedies of life and I despise depressing. This movie was DEPRESSING! I am talking...it grabs you by the eyeballs and drags you 150mph into a world you'd rather not ever visit and leaves you there. It was also just a plain old damn good movie too. The actors were believable and the filmwork was superb. I felt like I was thrust into the minds of the druggies and it wasn't fun. Ellen Burstyn...my god...what an actress. I loved/hated seeing the deterioration of that poor woman. Bottom line...I had to watch the Exorcist right after this just to feel clean!
3,A little negative in the positive.,"Perhaps because the author is a self-proclaimed ""self-taught"" artist, she writes as if she invented using negative space in art. As anyone who has ever taken any basic foundation courses or had the instructor shout out in a life drawing class ""pay attention to your negative space"", we are well aware of negative space. That being said, I found the book to be an interesting if limited approach to the subject of watercolor painting and I'll probably try incorporating some of her techniques into some of my paintings. If you're looking for more of a general survey of watercolor painting then this probably isn't the best book for you. If you're looking to add new techniques to your repertoire, give it a look-see, but buy it at the Amazon price."
4,colorful approach to composition,some author/artists have a unique ability to provide the right image and word picture to illustrate a concept. This artist & this book demonstrate that particular talent. It is an inspiring book that will cause your palms to itch with anticipation for an opportunity to try the ideas for yourself.
5,Watercolor Painting Outside the Lines,"My wife of 39 years is concerned that I, as a senior citizen, still cannot color within the lines. She has tried many things to instill a sense of order and discipline into my artistic creations. After the tragic incident with the macrame class, she re-introduced me to watercolor painting. As I cannot color within the lines, she said ""To hell with it!"" and purchased this book for me. She enjoys it very much and is currently using it as a reference for her work."
1,Worst thing ever made!!!,I got this as a present because I wanted a dust buster so I could vaccum my truck out. This thing never ever stays charged!! It also cant even suck up anything. A waste of money!!! I now own a shop Vac!!!!
5,MAking Peace With Your Father,I really enjoyed the insight this book gave me on the relationship between daughters and fathers during your lifetime. Very insightful.
4,MAKING PEACE WITH YOUR FATHER,Making Peace With Your FatherI THINK THAT ALL PEOPLE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. iT IS A LOT OF HELP TO YOU.
5,Marble Mouse Mania,"The Marble Mouse is not for the ""set in my ways"" sort. MM's are so superior in versatility, comfort and space saving design, that there is virtually no comparison with old style mice.If you work in Photoshop, CAD or any design program, the marble mouse is absolutely the only way to fly!!!"
3,Does not last long,I love this style of mouse but the problems that I have had is they quit working after only a few months. This is the fourth one I bought in three years.If I did not like it so much I would switch to something else. It is just so easy for me to use.
4,It's good once you get used to it,"I rates this a 3 last time because I found it difficult to use, but now changing it to a 4.Once you get used to it (could take a few days, that's one of the cons), it's very space efficient and easy to use. I've used it for the past 3 years and have been very happy with it. Best thing about using a trackball mouse of course is you don't need a flat surface for it to operate. Highly recommend."
4,Works well on my iBook,I used this to replace the ergonomically-challenged trackpad on my iBook. It was much easier to use and I was pleased with it overall. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that if you have big hands (as I do) it is not completely comfortable - but I have the same problem with just about any pointing device I have ever tried. If your hands are normal-sized to small I think you'll like this very much. My colleague down the hall loves hers (she uses a desktop PC).
1,poor substitute,"I bought this product in the hopes that it would approximate my old Logitech Trackman Marble FX M/N T-CJ12 P/N 804272-1000. I need a trackball mouse to use with my left hand. The Logitech Optical Marble Mouse caused stress on my hand within a couple of hours. From a design point of view, the trackball is too small and requires at least twice the rotations in order to move the pointer across my monitors. The shape of the mouse is too small for a man's hand to rest on. I just can't understand why Logitech stopped production of the Trackman Marble FX which is still being sold continuously on Ebay. So there is obviously a demand."
2,Not Impressed,"Not a bad mouse to use. I got three of them altogether for my wife and myself and none of them lasted very long. They required constant cleaning, and they all failed in various ways after just a few months. My old Kensingtom lasted for many years, but they don't make it any more. After this experience I gave up and went back to a regular mouse."
4,Excellent inexpensive trackball,"I purchased this trackball as my existing Microsoft Trackball Explorer was aging and I needed another finger operated trackball - thumb operated units caused pain after extended use. I was concerned that the button placement would be uncomfortable however I have found this not to be the case, using the trackball is very natural and I have not experienced any pain during extended use. The ball rolls very smoothly and the smaller inset auxiliary buttons (default to Back on left and universal scroll on the right) work well."
5,comfortable mouse for mac,i replaced my macs not so mighty mouse with this one and my carpel tunnel is much better. very easy to use and drivers for mac are available on logitech website. intel macs dont bother using disk. best thing is unlike the mighty mouse i dont have to clean this one constantly. if i ever have to clean it the big ball just pops right out. very happy with it!
4,Not as good as the Trackball Optical 1.0.,"I bought this mouse as a replacement for my cordless optical, it's a good buy for the price, however the ball in the center is hard to get used to. It's picks up very well and doesn't ""hang"" on a page, I personally prefer the mouse with the trackball on the left side, but once you get used to it it's not too bad. You have to take out the ball and clean the points every so often, HOW often depends on the environment the mouse is used in, I only have to clean mine every two months or so, and it only takes a minute to do it.For the price, you can't beat this mouse."
4,love the marble mouse,"I love the mouse, , but windows is refusing to recognize it often. that is frustrating, don't think it's the mouse but windows"
1,Don't buy this junk!,This track ball is worthless. I had one like it that worked great for over five years before the buttons quit working smoothly. So I bought a new one but it hasn't worked properly since day one. The pointer will just take off across the screen on it's on. It has a jerky action when moving the pointer to a new location. I tried downloading the Logitech software but it didn't help at all. Junk!
3,Get what you pay for,I liked this mouse alot. It was very confortable and easy to use but it stopped working after less than a year.
3,Love these things but.......,"I've been using the marble mouse for several years. Obviously, I like it. I use it both left and right handed and I do a lot of CAD work with it. I just bought two new ones and they both came with little pits on the ball. These prevent accurate use so this defect is totally unacceptable. As I said, I've used these marble mouses for years. The balls get dinged and pitted eventually, that's understandable but I have thrown away 3 recently for this defect. I suspect that Logitech is using a new vendor or specs. for the ball."
5,Terrific,"Absolutely love this mouse. This beats all others including cordless in my opinion. I got one for work, loved it so much I got one for home too. It's nice because your hand doesn't have to move, just your fingers. No need for a mouse pad if you don't want."
1,Little more than junk,"It has been years since I bought anything made by Logitech. Past experiences were that Logitech devices just stopped working after a few months, couldn't get support, and had to pay more for new drivers than I paid for the device itself. But I took a chance on this because I liked the feel of it and needed a new trackball after changing jobs. Well that was a mistake. After about six weeks the motion started getting jerky and then just stopped. Cleaning didn't help. I won't make this mistake again - Logitech makes junk."
4,4 buttons are better than 2,"I owned the old 2-button version of this device a few years back, and while it was nice, it was nothing special. Having the 2 programable buttons makes it worth checking out, the big trackball makes for accuracy in mouse movements once you get used to it, and the 2 extra buttons do whatever you want (I keep one set to ""back"" and the other as ""middle button"", which is perfect for firefox's tabbed browsing)It isn't perfect, but it's the best trackball for the money, IMO."
1,"Smooth ball, but the software and shape is for the birds!","I was used to using a Kensington Orbit - maybe I'm spoiled - but it seems crazy that this Marble Mouse doesn't let you assign a separate command for the pressing of 2 buttons at once. It's also crazy that you can't have different button configurations for different applications. Having to choose between 1X, 2X, or 4X mouse speed was kind of silly too, since even Apple's standard mouse driver gives you more options than that. Maybe the software is better for Windows and that's why people keep using these? I returned it the day after I bought it and bought another Orbit (which is also much more hand-shaped than this odd tall design). The Orbit feels like you are resting your hand on your knee - this feels more like youre resting your hand on a shaved rat with rigormortis."
2,Not fully Mac compatible,"THE UP AND DOWN SCROLL BUTTONS DO NOT WORK WITH MY MAC (OS 10.5), and since the driver CD-ROM is FOR WINDOWS ONLY, I can't do anything about it. With this thing I have to mouse over to the scroll bar and click + drag up and down, which is a stupid hassle. If I'd known that I wouldn't have bought it. (It's too inexpensive to return.) To say that it's Mac compatible is false advertising. On the up side, if I had a PC, I'd probably be satisfied."
5,Hands down the most important reference for cinematographers,"A book referenced by thousands of professionals with precise and easy to understand information. If you want to be on the technical side of filmmaking, become familiar with this book NOW."
4,Great stories about a Great Car!,This little book was devoured in a couple of hours - couldn't put it down! It was chock full of interesting facts about the Z - some we'd all seen before but a bunch of new stuff as well. Great stories about the Z's competitive history (with very good photos). Tracing the car's design evolution from concept to 240Z thru the 280ZX was well documented and illustrated. Well written and easy to read without much technical jargon to bog you down. Z owners need to get this book - it'll make you proud of your car!
1,It would never come through,I can only rate this with one star and it would never stream - only stop & start every few seconds. We ended up watching a Netflix movie that streamed beautifully!! This is the first time however that we've had trouble with a movie here.
2,Not my cup of tea...,"I had thought this a different movie, so I was not able to get into it. I am sure others felt it was a good one, but I did not."
2,WHT,When I first read the reviews I thought it can't be that bad. It was ok until it got towards the end. It ends terrible. Not great.
4,Self Discovery,"The film is small on words, big on emotions. The acting is suburb by all, it shows that not many words need to be said when you can understand the story through intense emotions.Margot(Michele Williams one of the best of our time) goes through everyday life trying to figure out what is missing in her life. She has a loving husband Lou (Seth Rogen CAN act) that is a charming cookbook writer, however Margot falls in love with a man (Luke Kirby, breathtakingly handsome) she met in a brief moment on a trip, he turns out to be her neighbor Daniel. Margot believes that Daniel (Kirby) is her missing piece. But truly, the real missing piece is the love that Margot should have for herself.There are many directions this film will take you , the real direction is that you must love yourself before you can truly love another."
1,Wasted two hours of my time,"The movie was boring, slow, had a weak plot, camerwork dizzying, unreal life situations, in general if I were you, I wouldn't waste my time."
3,Trailer looked enticing...,It was an OK flick but the ending was a little different then what I thought. She seemed a bit off center in her thinking at times.
3,Too much nudity and vulgarity.,"This had a good story line, but the nudity and vulgarity was not necessary. Why do the producers always feel the need to ruin a good movie with such things."
3,kind of boring,"Boring life, boring wife with boring husband,then grahic sex with new man. Then back to boring.Then it ends with her going back to whatever she was dreaming about."
3,Had Potential,"I think this movie had potential to be one of the really good ones. It let us in to the awkward moments a married couple can have even after 5+ years of marriage when you'd think by now, you knew each other but come to find out you've really moved more apart then you have together. The movie was ruined for me by her ""discovery phase"" or whatever you call it. I didn't understand why that was in the movie. It did nothing for the movie. Ehh...not a bad watch if you're looking for something serious."
5,Zoob,Really fun and a great alternative to Legos and blocks! Great gift as well. My kids both love these. Fun and creative.
5,A whole year's worth of fun!,"My son (then 5, now almost 6) got this for christmas last year and is still making ""structures"" with it. He plays with it almost every day. They are easy to use, even for my kid with fine motor delays, very well made (they will break if stepped on with boots, however...) and there are so many ways they can be used. My son has made cars, trucks, spaceships, satellites, and now light sabers out of these toys. Whatever he's currently ""into,"" he can make out of his zoobs. He has lost a few pieces so we're getting another set for him this year.It's rare to find a toy that they will play with for an entire year!"
1,Exploitative garbage,"This film stars the wooden has been lucia Mendez, about how she is sent to an insane asylum by mistake or is she, by the end of the film you don't care because it uses all of the same plot elements used in movies of this type, particularly exploiting the usual insane asylum patients. If you like garbage this movie is for you, otherwise stay away from this feeble trash."
5,an excellent movie,"you'll like this movie. Even if you're not fan of Lucia Mendez, you'll certainly fall in love, like I did. You will watch it endlessly.. It's charming&really good-made! Lucia Mendez&Gonzalo Vega just can't be better"
4,works well...what more do you need?,"The title says it all. It's a lot of storage space for not a lot of money. The only negative is that you have to plug it in for power...you can't run it just off of the USB cable. Other than that it's been working great as my external back-up hard drive. And, it looks totally cool. But what else would you expect from a designer of Italian sports cars?"
2,Ok while it lasted,"Have used it as an offsite backup drive that I keep at my office, bringing home once a week to backup to. Worked fine for that little use until it died recently. It was only 14 months old, guess you do get what you pay for."
1,I've had two of these.,"I received this as a gift. It quit working within the first week. I shipped it back to the manufacturer and they replaced it easy enough. After the second one worked awhile, naturally, I loaded it up with software, photos, music, etc... Its been about 10 months and it quit working yesterday. It making a funny noise. I am shopping for another external drive but it won't be another simple drive."
1,Broke on First Use,"On the first attempt to perform a full back-up, the drive completely failed and has not recovered. It does have a warranty but Simpletech refuses to pay for shipping to them so now I'm out an additional $20 because they want it FedExed. Don't buy this product!"
1,SimpleTech has lost my business forever,"This drive was working fine for about 6 months then suddenly died. I have been through plenty of computers and hard drives over the past 30 years and have never had a drive fail this quickly before. I opened the case, removed the drive and connected directly to a standalone SATA/USB dock and no luck - the drive won't even spin up. The drive inside is a Hitachi DeskStar which (as I recall) have quite a bad reputation.So.... there's goes a lot of family photos that I haven't had a chance to back-up along with my entire iTunes library. Silly me! I've now replaced this with a USB/SATA dock and a Seagate 750GB drive all for about $80.I also have a couple of SimpleTech Signature mini drives which haven't died completely but are experiencing errors. I really liked the form-factor and the ability to be powered directly from USB but they just didn't hold up either. SimpleTech has simply lost my business - 3 bad drives is enough for me to catch a clue!"
3,Simple Tech 320 gb USB HD,"the order process was good, the drive works fine, installation of the drive and the software was easy, the backup software that comes with the drive is awkward to use and not very configurable, in the end I sacrificed the 1-button function for a more configurable backup software"
4,Erasing Shield,Got this to put together a drafting took kit. This is just on piece that will come in handy in class.
4,"Old, but still good","C Programming Language (2nd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software)has become the gold standard of programming language books, and the Annotated C++ Reference Manual is the closest I've found to the simplicity and succinctness of K&R.;The content is old, but it's probably sufficient as a reference for most uses. It's still my primary reference with some use of web sources to fill in the gaps. I came to Amazon looking for a more up to date reference and was shocked to see the ""C++ Programming Language"" book is over 1000 pages!This book gives you the standard in precise language, decorated by commentary by the authors-- which is pretty much what K&R; did-- and fit it in a modest 400 pages."
5,Great but Outdated.,"This was ""The"" standard for creating C++ 99. Since then the standard libraries were added, a full implementation of templates and exception handleing etc. So while its a good reference for the ""core"" of C++, i.e. the classes etc, it shouldn't be the first book (or even the 2nd) on C++ you buy. Better to get the Hardcover ""The C++ Programming Language (Special 3rd Edition)"" which has chapters on all of the language.Note: That's not the first book on C++ you should get either, if you are just learning, it is however one you should own if you are going to profressionally write C++.On why there isn't a second edition of the ARM, has in part due to the restrictions for republishing the ISO standard. And its also 2003 and now the language looks like it will continue to evolve and thus a second ed. ARM would be soon out of date as well. Maybe we'll be lucky and there will be one for C++2005."
4,Early rock and roll at its best,"Hanks ""gets"" entertainment, and his choice of music to showcase in his movie, a labor of love, was spot on with enjoyment. Not only is the title track just a delight, but many of the other cuts are as well. No deep thoughts or theory, this is pure enjoyment."
5,It makes me want to dance!,"My mind is still in the 1960's where the music is light, and makes you happy. THAT THING YOU DO is exciting and fun. Thanks Tom Hanks!"
5,Great music for kids,"My son loves Finding Nemo and can pick out the song ""Beyond the Sea"" from miles away so we decided to get it on cd. My two boys who are under 3 years old love all the music on this cd and my husband and I can enjoy it also. Kid music, after a while, can drive you crazy. Great music for the whole family!"
3,Blues Clues,Son is in love with Blues Clues. But for some reason he didnt like this one so much. Maybe its because its so long. I dont know . So parts of it seem to go on and on ...and it makes you want to hit the forward button.
4,Anxious to try,"I am going to Savannah in August and I am hoping the book is up to date. I stayed away from the Kindle version because of the reviews that it was dated information. Ive enjoyed Frommers guides to other places and although I cannot speak s to how accurate the book is, it is certainly laid out in an easy and pleasing format. I would have given 5 stars but there are certain places in the book that are very vague and seemed pushed in at the last minute for word count but overall I would recommend. Now to see if the info is correct."
2,"Works fine, but I don't care for it","I own a dance studio and I've gone through many tape decks through the years. This one is not really user friendly for my purposes. I personally don't care for decks that play tapes on the reverse side, since it makes it too hard for me to quickly find the song I am looking for. Also, you can't make good edits from one tape to another with this type of deck. I prefer the older type decks that only play one side of the tape."
1,not suggested,"need amplifier or whatever other devices in order to have sound come outso tired of this kind of equipment.copy function is also badthis 100$ product is even worse than a 20$ product like sony TCM-150I am sorry I have to say this.However the seller's service is the best, 5 star."
5,Sony dual tape player/recorder,"This is the second Sony dual tape player/recorder TCWE475 I've had in fifteen years. I'm a professional entertainer and I really put this machine through the mill,editing,and taping. It holds up wonderfully. I'm very pleased with this product and with the service I got through Amazon.com. and the company who supplied it.Arkansas Red-Ozark TroubadourOzark Mountains, Arkansas"
1,Dearest,"Not good at all. Bought off internet store, so didn't have high expectations. One review on the cover said 'For lovers of the macabre'. First off, it's written I believe by a British writer. So alot of British phrases are used which slowed up the read for me a little. 2nd, it's written like a diary. Totally in the 1st person. Maybe that is a classic style, but found it a very boring style. 3rd, he will say something in one paragraph and then the same thing in another paragraph just worded different. Didn't find the flow of the book to be very interesting. The ending, to me, went nowhere. The cover of the paperback and the reviews suck you in. But just found it to be alot of hype. Had a few horrific descriptions which were funny at best. Not my type of horror book."
1,shipping confusion,"I have the same problem with this item, and have written three letters to customer service about it. THere is no reason why this item should not be shipped to Hawaii. It is neither heavy, hazardous or oversized. I was about to make quite a large purchase from Amazon, but after such horrible customer service I will take my business elsewhere."
4,Very good mystery/thriller involving drug dealing.,This is the first book I've read by Richard Price. I liked the story and the ending was a surprise. The details of drug-dealing and homicide investigation (the book involves both) are incredibly intricate and really add to the book's quality. The story did seem to drag on a bit though and that's why I only gave it 4 stars rather than 5. Spike Lee's movie version is very good also.
3,Destined to be a movie,"While I really enjoyed this book, everything in the book seemed to be written as if it was meant to be a film. Very heavy on conversation and visual imagery. Every chapter I read just confirmed that this was a screenplay more than a book. Still worthwhile reading, and I need to rent the video."
2,Too heavy for me,"This was just too heavy for me. I struggled through half the book before giving up. It is very realistic and saddening but too much detail on every page. I just could not get involved in it, could not sympathise with any characters nor force myself to continue to the end."
1,Classy Shoes,"The only problem I have with these shoes is the heel height. I take a size 12 so when shoes list the heel height it is for a much smaller size and the heel height goes up considerably for larger sizes. These heels are over 3 inches, however, these shoes make my foot look smaller and can be worn with jeans as well as with dressier outfits. I love them!!!"
1,Just plain awful,"This movie is just plain bad. It starts out OK, grabs your attention, and the premise is somewhat interesting (wife convicted of murdering husband, convicted, but he's actually alive, wife breaks out...).But... it quickly goes downhill. Predictable, boring, hard to believe at times... this is one of those flicks that would go straight to video if it didn't have stars attached..You can tell Tommy Lee Jones is just going through the motions - if you look closely at the end you can tell even he thinks the script is terrible!"
5,Great Movie!,"This is a great underdog, who-done-it, action-paced thriller. If you like Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones you will not be disappointed."
1,Dumbest movie ever,"The entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched, it is actually completely false. The concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with WHOM is murdered (or is otherwise the victim), but WHAT you did, in distinct criminal incidents. Even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone, if you go back and murder them ""again"" then that is a new incident, and double jeopardy does not apply.In movies intended to be fantastic, diverging this much from reality might be OK. But this is a mainstream legal thriller. It's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don't, for no apparent reason.But the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means, or they just (accurately) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is."
1,I hate framing movies.,"After reading the storyline of this movie, it seems like a framing movie, so I didn't even bother to watch it because framing movies piss me off."
1,"A female ""Fugitive"" and that's not a good thing","This movie made a lot of money. Why? Because people enjoy seeing movies they've already seen, but just changed a little bit. Although everyone seems to hate ""EYES WIDE SHUT"", which is unlike any other movie, they still preferred this garbage over it. The plot is lifted directly from ""The Fugitive"" as is Tommy Lee Jones. The scene where she is locked in the coffin is purely done so people can go ""Oh no!"", but it is done with such implausibility that it doesn't make any sense. If the premise of this movie sounds intriguing to you, just watch ""The Fugitive"". Just stop having movies like this make money because then they will make more. Try anything else but this rubbish PLEASE."
4,Really good movie!,"I thought this movie was very good, although it isn't my favorite or anything. Tommy Lee Jones, as always, was VERY good, playing his usual character who learns that the person he is chasing is innocent. I never get tired of him playing this type of role, for he always brings an intensity and wit to the performance. Ashley Judd was very believable as the woman who was wrongly accused for her husband's murder. The pairing of these two were great. She had an innocent and youthful appearance, while he had an older, hard-nosed personality. The two blended very well. I like this movie for many reasons, and I recommend it to all who want to see a fast-paced action thriller. The ""Making Of"" was also outstanding, and is one of the reasons I purchased this DVD. I always LOVE to see how a movie is filmed!"
3,Good work by Tommy Lee & Ashley!,"I saw this movie last Halloween at my dad's fiancée's house, and I loved it! It REALLY kept me on the edge of my seat! I thought Tommy Lee (Jones) and Ashley (Judd) dazzled as Travis Lehman and Libby Parsons. DOUBLE JEOPARDY has it all. Mainly, it's full of suspense. My favorite quote of this film is, ""Show's over! Go to sleep!"" I thought that Libby (Ashley Judd) looked VERY beautiful in the fancy Armani dress she wore at the bachelor's auction in New Orleans. An excellent and suspenseful movie, I give DOUBLE JEOPARDY three out of four stars."
3,"Movie was worth seeing, but the DVD needed more extras.","The plot of the movie is that Ashley Judds charactor gets convicted of murdering her husband, only to find that he is still alive. After serving six years in prison she is released to the halfway house run by Tommy Lee Jones, who plays too much like his ""Fugitive"" role, and she begins a quest for revenge. The DVD only comes with the Theatrical Trailer and a behind the scenes. The studio (Paramount) needs to start putting more extras on their discs or lose sales to companies like Universal, Warner, and New Line who load on the extras and charge less per movie."
2,Good story!,"What I liked about this movie is the shocking story but the acting was not good.If you know the story of this movie, then there is nothing left to enjoy watching in this film."
4,A very entertaining thriller,"Double Jeopardy isn't exactly one those edge of your seat thrillers but it's always consistently entertaining and it's made better by two great leading performers. Sure, the film bears a lot of similarities to The Fugitive but the lack of originality doesn't make this a film any less fun to watch.Of course, the best thing this film offers is Ashley Judd, who is without a doubt, one of the (if not the) most beautiful actresses working today. She delivers a superb performance that's actually Oscar worthy. I liked the fact that her character thought her way through each situation. Tommy Lee Jones is good, as usual, though not at his scene stealing best. Still, he's one of the best actors of all time and he doesn't hurt himself with this film.Double Jeopardy has enough suspenseful moments, intelligence, good acting, and competent direction to keep viewers interested. It's definitely, at the very least, worth a rental."
3,Not bad at all,"Though not fantastic either... Ashley Judd is the most stunning woman ever, and kicks serious arse in this film, which is always refreshing. But the characters are the same as they were in all their other films. Definitely watchable, definitely predictable."
2,"Interesting premise, but falls short","Interesting premise, promising actors, but too many shortcuts and time jumps take the bite out of the story. Disappointing."
2,Idiotic Thriller,"By-the-numbers thriller wastes Ashley Judd as a woman framed for her husband's murder, and Tommy Lee Jones as a crusty-old-salt parole officer who chases her across the country. Laughable claptrap throws credibility out the window after the first 10 minutes: Judd is tried and convicted in no time at all; her son hasn't aged by the time of the trial. In reality it would take at least two years before a trial was held. Also, the scriptwriters aren't aware that Washington State abolished the parole system about ten years ago.It gets sillier by the minute, with car crash chase scenes reminiscent of the Blues Brothers. Of course all is well at the end, but you knew that, right?Not a bad rental if you're in the mood for some slickly photographed silliness, but otherwise a waste of time."
3,fugitive 3 and the trailer says it all.,"what started as a good idea, quickly turns into fugitive 3. same idea and concept. the acting is not bad and is the movies big redeeming feature. the main characters go from being amzing clever to doing the dumbest things. it is watchable and can be enjoyable, but there is nothing really new in it. watch it."
2,ATTRACTS mosquitoes,"This product actually attracts more mosquitoes than usual to me--and I'm very attractive to mosquitoes. I give it two stars rather than one only because it does not cause a skin rash, unlike some of the other Burt's Bee's products that I've tried."
3,Alexander Gerard Designs for Herman Miller,"Great and thorough history about his collaboration with Miller, but the images and coloring are of poor quality, only taking away from his art. Also, some images are too small, it would have been nice to have more full page images to really appreciate the detail of his craft. Also, there are only two Girard books that I know of, and this one only covers part of his career; i wish it was more comprehensive."
1,Extra spacers,"Do not buy - a waste of money. With shipping I paid $10 for a handful of spacers. The deicing kit I purchased did not spedify how many clips were included, but it includes plenty. Amazon indicated that this item was usually bundled with the purchase of the deicing kit."
3,Low budget but well acted by Sharon Stone,"Caught this late night on TV. Very good ""B"" movie. Early Sharon Stone flick shows that she can act very well. For another good early Stone film check out The Year Of The Gun. Worth watching."
3,It's just alright...,The plot is a laugh-riot. Sharon is real pretty. Sharon makes the film toleratably...if it was cast with any other lead it would be Just Another Bad Late Night Movie.Don't bother buying this flick...it's on cable often enough.
3,Not very good....,"This case barely fits over the top of the phone. It looks very out of place, like it does not fit the phone. I guess i should have noticed that the hinge on the u740 needs space, therefore it cannot cover the whole phone. This case is also very hard to remove. It took me around five minutes just to get it off! Just overall pretty bad. Maybe I will all customer service like the person above me."
3,Not bad,"I'll be honest. I watched this movie just because Matt Damon and Claire Danes were in it. They both did excellent performances, and so did the rest of the cast. The movie was a little long in places and if you don't know much about law, you don't really know what's going on. All in all though, this was not a bad movie."
5,Great movie,Great story with engaging characters. Excellent acting from Matt Damon and Jon voight. All of John grisham's movies are worth watching.
3,An Average Movie,"Although the premise was of interest, the movie did not deliver. There were some memorable quotes, though."
5,Rainmaker,I really enjoyed this movie. I had to watch it for a class and I was not sure how I would like it when it was described to me but when I started to watch it I really enjoyed it. It has a good story line to it and the characters are great. I would recommend this movie to every one.
2,"kind of boring and shallow, great acting tho","maybe this is why my favorite movies are x-men and pirates of the caribbean. maybe movie-writing has changed for the better in the past 10 years. it just seemed platitudinal--either 'good guys' or 'bad guys' and plenty of obvious heart-tugging, even if for valid reasons. just seemed like a hallmark special, and i'm not a fan of matt damon's southern accent most of the time. can't fault the acting, but it was so slow!platitude (plt-td, -tyd)n. 1. A trite or banal remark or statement, especially one expressed as if it were original or significant. See Synonyms at cliché.2. Lack of originality; triteness."
4,another Legacy Recordings collectible digipak reissue,"i was pleasantly surprised to find this coming to me packaged in a digipak version like the other journey 2006 reissue albums that i have been collecting so of course i had to go buy the rest of perry's albums which thankfully for the pocketbook spans only 3 albums while journey is something like 20 albums with all the various compilations and permutations. best song on this album is definitely oh sherrie and foolish heart, the others are ok but take some repeated listening to really enjoy. if you're a perry fan definitely get this album. not as rocking as a journey album but some listenable pop ballads can be found."
4,"""a white sam cooke"" or ""modern day shakespeare""","he has a stunning voice, very soulful, and boy, can he hold a note!!is this man the shakespeare of rock music?as soon as this albums starts with the tinkly piano chords closely followed by violin & steve shouting ""i shoulda been gone""! - you are hooked.the pure voice quality on ""go away"" is like sumptuous velvet& the emotion in ""foolish heart"" tugs at the heart strings.my favourite ""she's mine"" - purely for the big sound & steve fighting for his woman. the last 3 tracks are nostalgia, following by the painful angst of unrequited love - the final echo of ""strung out"" completes this album very neatly.this is definitely in my list of all time fave albums."
4,GOT TO HAVE BOOK!,This book is insperational with amazing insights in her art work and lifestyle. if you want to find out about this amazing woman and her art work you should buy this book!
5,Impressive works with a great message! Refreshing!,What a rare and refreshing treat to watch movies that encourage and uplift showing the better side of humanity when people choose to live for more than themselves.
5,This DVD Christian Series is wonderful!,"Fireproof is an absolute classic movie - A must have!!! The other two movies were interesting but nothing in comparison to Fireproof. I cried hysterically with Fireproof, the message was sooooo REAL and relevant to many of us who at some point have been involved with someone in a relationship, which means everyone and I mean everyone will learn from these movies. You will definitely love these movies. ;D"
1,booooooooooring,"These three movies are the most boring, lifeless, watered down, uninspiring waste of time. Avoid these three movies at all cost if you value your time. Worthy of a Negative 5 star rating."
2,Strange.... A band who aren't whining about lost love,"I love this. The lyrics actually mean something instead of just being boring teen-band platitudes about, ""OH, True Love, How novel! """
5,Great!,"A really great CD, I didn't really listen to Jaci, until I heard her song God so Loved on the internet, I bought both her CD's after I heard that song."
5,What a great voice!,"I had heard one of the cuts from this CD several months before my wife purchased this. I was quickly and pleasantly surprised at the quality of her voice, the strong content of the lyrics and the ability that my wife, my daughters and I can all relate to her music."
3,Is it really that bad?,"""Star Trek V"" was panned by critics (the same critics who praised the ridiculous and torturously dull fourth movie) because the plot was hard to follow. And it's true, the plot is jumbled for about the first hour. Even so, one should appreciate the director's attempt to stay faithful to the Enterprise's mission of ""boldly going where no man has gone before,"" instead of focusing on Kirk's relationship with Spock, diplomatic squabbles with other alien species, or trendy 20th century issues like saving the whales. And the ending is great. Of all of the movies with the original cast, this is my third favorite. It is overlooked by fans and undeservedly so."
2,I give it a 2 because...,"I only really liked two of the songs on this album which would be ""All cried out"" and ""Last chance"" which were both slow songs.I liked these two songs because 1. They bring back a lot of memories and 2. because they're both just really pretty songs . The rest I could care less for."
4,It's not that bad people,"I admit the first time i heard this cd i hated it. Then I listened to it again for the second time and i liked most of it. The stand out songs are All Cried Out, Last Chance, Head Over Heals, When you Need Someone, and The Story. You have to grow into the CD."
2,Fun game to play once you can get it together!,Like other reviewers stated this game is difficult to put together without ruining the peices. Once together it cannot be put away easily but if you place the peices on their sides you can kinda close the lid on the box. You really do not want to have to take apart the peices because they will wear down or rip if you have to put them together too many times(we taped ours to help them stay together).My boys 7 and 5 do find the game fun and they can play it on their own. I find that it is a very easy game to play and it ends quickly so they usually end up playing a few rounds.
5,A great read!,"Hawaii is a classic! If you love historical sagas, this is the ultimate! Takes a bit to get ""into"" the story, but stick with it--you'll be glad you did. I love following family characters down through the generations and that's what you get with Hawaii. Plus you learn a lot about how the different groups came to Hawaii, settled there, and made it into the Hawaii we know today. Great summer read!"
2,Way Too Long For Me,"Wow, this is the biggest book I have read in a long time. I just did not have the stamina for it. I read the book on a trip to Hawaii. I will say it did give a good feel for the place and the history of it. But it was just way too long with what I fealt was too much detail in many parts. Also I found it impossible to keep track of the characters. There are 5 missionary families that intermarry and use last names for first names. I could not keep Hoxforth Hale straight from Hale Hoxforth. (Yes I know there were family trees in the back, but I could not spend my whole time flipping back and forth). So if you are going to Hawaii or just interested in the place and you have lots of time and patience this book may be for you. But for me, I would prefer something shorter."
5,A good read,"Having been to Hawaii recently, I was interested in its history. Knowing that Michener's novels are usually historically correct (with names changed to avoid lawsuits) I purchased the book. It is an excellent read - informative, interesting, and entertaining. It shed a great deal of light on the early history of Hawaii, also on the events since its discovery by modern man. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
5,Wonderful read!,"I have read a number of Michener's books, so I came late to this one. I really enjoyed the book. Michener has his own unique way of developing characters. You feel like you really know and care about the people he writes about. Although it is a very good book, it's still not ""My"" favourite Michener - for me that would have to be Chesapeake."
2,"No, it isn't java e-commerce!","In the whole book, the authors discussed one case of using a swing GUI to query an Oracle database, coffee shop. Although querying a database may be considered part of e-commerce, it is hardly enough! Jsp, Servlets and EJBs were only mentioned briefly towards the end of the book. Even for additional reading, it is hardly worth the time and money( there are some errors in the sql scripts as some other reviewers has pointed out ).Java has come a long way since the time this book was published and there are much better books now:1. If you want to learn java and Oracle, buy wrox' Pro Oracle8i with java and xml.2. If you want to learn java e-commerce, buy also wrox's Pro Java E-commerce.You will not regret buying these two books."
2,Actually 2-1/2 stars.,"While not being the thashfest that Damned Damned Damned was and not getting too much into the gloom that surouned Phantasmagoria was(although closer to that). Anything kinda sounds like The Black Album only not done as well. There are some good tracks:""Anything"" and ""Psychomania"" is probably the closest to punk that they've gotten in a while, and the cover of Love's ""Alone Again Or"" is a great tribute to the original. But there is plenty of filler. The fans of the Damned's older stuff would probably like this one over Phantasmagoria, I know I did."
2,was trendy music in it's time,"Most of Gary Numan's music is unlistenable today b/c it was way too trendy. Trying to capitalize on the new wave, machine sounding craze. Today that sounds silly. His best stuff was the guitar driven and more conventional (less synthesizer) stuff. Are friends electric, down in the park and the guitar riff songs are the best.He should take some of these decent songs, dump the stupid sythesizer and fake drum sounds and re-work the songs as real rock songs.Check out the cd ""Return of the Rentals"" by the Rentals (an off- shoot of Weezer). They do Gary Numan better than Gary Numan!"
3,Needs more features,"Unless your a DVD buff like me, I wouldn't buy this movie because it doesn't have enoungh features.I mean the DVD could have the delted fight scene between Christan Bale and Samuel L.Jackson that takes place at the airport or a commentary with Richard Roundtree,John Singleton and Sameul L.Jackson and another one with Issac Hayes set to a isolated fil, score. The transfer is great and the sound is crisp but the DVD need more features for us buffs."
1,"""I thought it was a spoof""","This film had one thing going for it--it was completely laughable! I thought it was a spoof like the naked gun series but then I read the box and it was a serious film. What a joke. The plot was non-existent.The arch villian, ""peoples"" was an idiot. The bonehead crooked cops couldn't catch a shoplifter if they cornered one in a K-Mart restroom.Unbelievable...."
1,Painfully predictable,I was really bored watching this movie. Unoriginal plot and a stupid ending. Samuel Jackson was overwhemingly fiery. I could only appreciate Christian Bale's performance.
2,Shafted,Often times the original cant be topped. Such is the case with this movie. Although I always enjoy a performance by Aamuel L Jackson and a young Vanessa Williams was nice. Movie is worth the price I paid to watch on my laptop and it did keep my attention.
4,Compelling: One of her Best,"I greatly enjoyed this intriguing book with two related stories. First is the story of Nell Latimer, a contemporary scientist, sleeping and waking for 1000 years in the hideaway that protected a handful of scientists from an asteroid strike. The other is Disme Latimer, who lives in the post-apocalyptic, authoritarian civilization that is being corroded from beneath by the ancient god, Bael, and his minions.The story is an interesting mix between hard sci-fi [Armageddon disaster, cold-sleep etc.] magic and religion. A very complex novel, and some of it gets unwieldy at the end, but it’s fun to read and basically very satisfying."
5,Nail Tek II,I have been using Nail Tek II for several years. It is a very good product and I highly recommend it to anyone who has nails that are weak or splitting.
3,Works but flakes,"This is a frustrating product, partly because it actually works. My nails peel and flake, separating into layers that peel back from the tips. Unsightly - and nothing I'd tried did any good. This NailTek product, when used consistently, actually fixed the problem! The trouble is that it won't stay on the nail. It chips off within 24 hours and has to be reapplied. Sometimes it's in bad shape within 18 hours. I bought another NailTek product that has a matte finish (this one's glossy) and put it on top. It still flakes and chips off. When I apply the other product alone, it stays on much better. I don't think it works as well against the peeling, though. If you're willing to remove and reapply every single day, this stuff may well fix your nails."
1,Not,I really wanted this product to work. I was looking for something to harden my nails and this was just like putting on a regular top coat and it didn't feel any different. I am returning this product.
5,Must Have Christmas Album,"This was my favorite Christmas album when I was a kid. I had it on vinyl and listened to it over and over. My favorite songs were ""We Just Had a Party and Gee it Was Great"", ""Turkey Dinner, Turkey Dinner"", ""Seven Days Til Vacation"" and ""First Skaters Waltz"". I would dance on top of my toybox (my stage) while singing along to the songs and acting out others. I've often wondered whatever happened to the album and have missed as a lost part of my childhood. Thanks to Amazon.com, I get to download it and own it again and relive the memories."
5,great product and customer service.,Product seems to be working better than expected. Customer service was great. I received the product much faster than expected.
5,An enjoyable and quick read.,"Another side-spliting romp with Phule and his rag-tag crew. But, this time they are casino guards."
3,Other Books,"Casino crimewatch.Yeah, if being in the military wasn't enough of an issue, having to watch over a casino rather than mess around there doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun, either. This is exactly why Phule and his now highly efficient company get sent there, as payback for showing up those who expected this whole venture to be a failure. It is just ok, really."
3,good but not great,"All right, I really liked this record, but I think the first record beats this one by far, simply because Mineral really rocks out on the first record and they honestly sound like they mean every word they sing. I mean, I really liked the second one, but I think a lot of the songs sound the same. That is one of the problems about this second record, but again, the lyrics are amazing and it is too bad that there is no more Mineral. I would of love to of seen them. Listen to the first record before the second."
5,Excellent,this is one of my favorite cd's that i own...it is so filled with emotion its almost overwhelming! i would recomend this album to any fans of emo...i would recomend it even if you aren't! i was fortunate enough to see The Gloria Record in concert and they are a very good band also...
3,Just barely 3 stars but the spree moves on....,"I rented this movie at the video store and the kid behind the counter said ""Ahwsome.... one of my favorite movies"". Oh.... videoheads.Russell Crowe was just fun to watch, unleashed and just going for it. It looked like he probably hadn't had this much fun on screen since ""Romper Stomper"". Just able to tear things up a bit.Downside no one else had as much fun as he did. Isn't that the point of acting, you enjoy what you're doing more than anything else, why won't they let us see that?"
4,"Good, campy sci-fi action","""Virtuosity"" is a film that is undeniably campy despite its now mind-boggling starpower duo (2000's Best Actor Russel Crowe, and 2001's Best Actor Denzel Washington), and yet at the same time, despite this, it has some emotional impact coupled with all the slam-bang action and far-fetched science fiction. Crowe delivers an excellent performance, and clearly enjoys this early role. Washington is as wonderful as ever (though, admittedly, it seems strange that he found himself in this film). ""Virtuosity"" is pure fun - provided you can give your brain a little nap and just enjoy the show."
1,Every actor has a movie like this,"I am a Denzel Washington fan.I kinda like Russell Crowe.This movie is to be avoided if you don't want to taint your impression as actors. Absolutely a horrible movie, rotten script, bad directing, waste of two good actors... kinda cool idea, though, of using nano technology to give life to a virtual entity - I'd like to see Lawnmower man exit his virtual cage via this gimick.Anyway, I put this in the same category as Escape from LA. To be avoided at all costs. No matter the cheap price."
4,Sid is the Reason to See This Movie,"I just saw the movie largely becuase I had heard that Russell Crowe was brilliant in it and I was definitely not disappointed. He is brilliant and more. He is vicious and loving every minute of it. He has a killer sense of humor and a panther's grace. The plot is entirely average and Denzel Washington did not have enough to do. The only reason to see it, is to see yet another face of Russell Crowe performced beautifully."
4,Crowe & Washington,Russell Crowe darn near steals the movie from Denzel. Crowe plays his part perfectly. One gets fasinated by his evil character. A five start performance for Crowe. Denzel gives his usual solid treatment to his character in this one. I would like to see Denzel take a part that forces him to stretch and test his talent. He is a solid performer that can do so much more.
4,GAME OF DEATH(THAT BAD ?),"TRUE BRUCE WASNT IN MOST OF THE MOVIE, AND THOSE SCENES RECORDED WITH STUNT DOUBLES LEFT A LITTLE TO BE DESIRED, BUT IT CLEARLY BEATS OUT FISTS OF FURY AND COMES CLOSE TO CHINNESE CONNECTION IN MANY WAYS. THE FINAL 1/2 HOUR DISPLAYS THE FINEST FIGHT SEQUENCES THIS SIDE OF ENTER THE DRAGON. WHILE IT IS DISAPOINTING TO SEE ACTORS ACTING TO BE LEE, THE FUNERAL SHOULD BE SEEN AS A TRIBUTE TO BRUCE AND HIS WORK, AND THE FINALIE IS A PLEASURE THAT IS WORTH WATCHING."
3,ONLY WORTH SEEING FIRST THREE FIGHTS AT THE END,This film was ok but only worth watching the first three fights near the end of the film the rest of them were the other actor fighting. If you live in the U.K. you won't see the first fight its been cut from the film all in all its a good try but not the real thing.
2,SHAME it has been EDITED in American way.,"WHY did American production CUT OFF all the POINT Bruce Lee was trying to make out of this film before he was murdered? I see NO RESPECT, nor HONOR for Bruce Lee in this film. CHEAP RUINED MOVIE....what a disgrace. At least Chinese people should have finished the film instead of Hollywood who made money off of it."
4,I agree that it's exploitation but ...,"one of the best martial arts movies ever made.First let me comment on something that noone else has , John Barry's music:It's fantastic and it really gives the movie an epic tone. My favorite kind of music is classical so perhaps people with different tastes won't dig it very much but that's how I feel. In particular the title sequence and the fight with Robert Wall in the locker room are incredible.The later I think is the best martial arts fight sequence ever made.Pay special attention to the final ""execution scene"" and the accompaniment provided by the percussion.Is it the double who appears on that sequence ??? He looks very much like Bruce Lee.As for Jabar his round kicks ( maybe that's not the proper term ) look awfully unrealistic don't you think ? Nevertheless the idea of a tower with different opponents on every floor is fantastic and it reminds me of computer games.I wonder who inspired whom ?"
2,Sent Wrong movie,I ordered Game of Death and they sent me Enter the Dragon. They didn't even have Game of Death nor did they let me know. They did allow me to keep the movie for free though.
4,4 STARS TO BRUCE ONLY!,"... They will forever be criticized for this movie. Game Of Death was unfinished and...they should of left it alone! Now they could have been smart and think into the future and tried to complete the movie with look-alikes, but with the original script and characters, brought in Lee's top students like Dan Inosanto and Ted Wong and so on for second hand knowledge of Bruce's style. Later in the future, like now! They could use CGI or Computer Animation to complete it. This is not far fetched because George Lucas thought of computer technology in the future when he filmed STAR WARS in 1977! This movie came out in 1978. Well I don't think it's impossible, but now half the cast is old and two are dead so they would all be CGI if Film Makers could complete the Game Of Death."
3,A cheesy sci-f movie good for a Saturday afternoon,"3 of 5 stars for this cheesy sci-fi movie. The basic plot has been done and redone several times and this version isn't any better. The story has the world-ending if the crew of this ""Earth-submarine"" can't successfully dig into middle-Earth and trigger some nukes. Of course, there is some spy stuff and some double-crosses to make it interesting. A trivial romance is misplaced in this movie.So, it is OK and worth the watch, but, it isn't the best sci-fi I've seen."
4,"Good, but...","This soundtrack is good, but it should ahve had some beautiful songs on it, like ""You get me"" by Michelle branch, ""Hello"" by sugarbomb...by the way, joe, the song when she calls him and he doesn't reply then Taj enters is ""Okay"" by Swirl 360. Music fan, the song when they kiss is ""Hello"" by sugarbomb, and the one that says ""Love is in the air"" is ""Girl on the roof"" by David Mead"
3,Need Help With a Song!,"Yo, can any one help me out. The song starts to play after Gwen pulls the fire alarm so she can get Van's academic records. It continues for a few more seconds when Gwen goes outside and starts to look at them. Part of the lyrics are ""supervision the incision"" and ""here comes the boys"". I tried searching for the lyrics with google but i didnt get anything. (This part of the movie is right before the swim team fundraiser). Thanks."
3,De la Soul?,I could swear i heard a de La Soul song twice in this movie but don't see it here. anyone???
4,Song title anyone?,"Does anybody know what the name of the song that runs over the end credits, right after the outtakes? Sounds very familiar."
3,"great movie, decent soundtrack","a lot of songs from the movie were left off the cd, bummer. does anyone know the name of the songs that is playing when Taj is with Naomi and catches on fire? thanks"
4,another music question,"Here is another music question about the movie, but this is about a song on the dvd menus. What is the song playing over the screen where you can choose b/t Fullscreen and Widescreen? Does anyone know?"
3,THAT SONG,DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE NAME OF THE SONG WHERE VAN AND TAJ ARE PUTTING CANINE SEMEN INTO THE HOT DOGS. IT'S A GUITAR SOLO VERY JAMES BONDISH.ANYONE
3,help me,"i think i speak for many when i post that : we (I) need the name of the song that plays in the credits that sounds similar to a graduation song put to a techno-ish beat. If anyone could e-mail me or post the name of the song in the end credits and that plays in small intervals throughout the movie, it would be GREATLY appreciated."
4,All your wrong with the De La song!!,"First of all great soundtrack for a great movie!But the song with Pas from De La Soul isn't Eye Word or what ells you all stupid peeps say! Check the movie, it's called Show Me, and is be Pas from Dee La Soul, so now you know."
1,How can they call it the soundtrack?,Once again I hear a song in a movie and go to listen to a sample and find out the name from the sound track listing and it isn't on it.
4,German Pop ABBA-like,"If you like ABBA and catchy 70s pop music, and aren't averse to listening to music in other languages, check out Dschinghis Khan! Toe-tapping fun stuff. Not too serious, but excellent entertainment."
1,"Dull, dull, dull",Pass on this one. Monticello itself takes a back seat to the Levy saga of buying the estate.
4,A House Preserved,"A thoroughly researched narrative, this book is well described in its subtitle. Thomas Jefferson's Monticello was for some years in very poor condition. Jefferson died in debt, and as seen on the book's cover, left this unique house nearly in ruins, shutters hanging off their hinges, a leaking roof and weeds in the gutters. This is a story of auctions, lawsuits, sales and purchases, with the efforts of the Levy family to restore this house to optimum condition. There were demands that the house be presented to the U.S. government; undertones of anti-Semitism in criticism of the Levy family's ownership; and efforts to form an organization to take over the preservation. Would the Levys' work of many years finally be recognized?Genealogies, notes, bibliography and index complete this account."
5,great book,i thoroughly enjoyed the book. visited monticello a few years ago and loved the place. the book gives the history of the home. easy reading.
5,This is like a miracle.,I use DMSO to control joint pain. Then I noticed that any wounds or abrasions in the area healed so fast that I couldn't miss it. I use it to get the tea tree oil to penetrate into my toenails and clear the fungus out of the toenails. You have to keep at it but it works and it doesn't harm your liver. If you get it get the DMSO book to see all the different things you can use it for.
5,"Its fabulous, Its real and Its about daily life.",The first time I heard this song I really found my inner self. I realised that this is for real and its gonna be a hit.It gives strength to those who seem to be weak and it gives power to those who seem to be loosing... Well Done !!! Marie
5,The better singer,"Mariah Carey is the great singer, sua voz é maravilhosa, sinto em suas canes muito sentimento. God bless you Mariah. Marta Cristiane"
4,Not My Favourite Mariah Album,"It's not as compelling as MUSIC BOX or DAYDREAM -but personally i find them boring!. This CD is lyrically marvellous -but to me its not, RAINBOW would've been much better, musically it [stunk]. But i believe if you listen to MARIAH CAREY, EMOTIONS, MUSIC BOX AND DAYDREAM -without listening to her latest R&BPOP; work, you'll discover she takes a journey wit this CD, she explores musically turns Hip-Hop and R&B; working with Missy Elliott.Honey -not the best single but okButterfly My All are all usually typed ballad singles.The Roof and Breakdown are new stuff, !!! -great stuff.This CD has 6 ballads, and 6 Hip-Hop, Pop & R&B; influenced type music songs.A MUST HAVE for all Mariah fans -this is a break through!"
3,This 'Butterfly' Doesn't Fly,"Far and away her weakest album to date, BUTTERFLY was the continuation of Carey's attempt to incorporate hip-hop and r&b into her mostly pop sound. While the mid to uptempo tracks here are quite good, the ballads are what bring this record down. The title track is serviceable, but is basically a remake of her previous hit 'Hero'. 'My All', though revered by some, is her worst ballad since 'I Don't Wanna Cry', and the music surrounding the song is just as depressing as that of said record. This album's remake, of Prince's 'The Beautiful Ones', is downright bad, and finds her and guests Dru Hill completely out of their element. On a more positive note, members of Bone Thugs-In-Harmony provide distinctively fresh vocal work on 'Breakdown', and 'The Roof' is another very decent attempt at credible hip-hop beats. Ultimately, though, even those few bright spots can't save what is overall a very dull record."
3,"pretty tight, but not enough songs......","i find myself listenin to the first half more, although i like the second half...i dont like 3 songs off this album but it still worth the money, i wish she came out with 4 more songs....2 upbeat ones more R&B flava and with tight beats by timbaland.....2 other slow songs....i think she never have enough songs...im glad she came out with 5 singles though...my favs are THE ROOF, BREAKDOWN, MY ALL, WHENEVER YOU CALL......."
5,This album is THE BEST!,"I have every single one of Mariah's albums, and even some songs that were never released, and I must say that ""Butterfly"" is they best album of hers' by far! If you're a true Mariah fan you'll definatley appreciate this album. It's so deep! Everything she sings about is so real. You can tell she's singing from her heart. Yea, it may not have her singing those high notes like she usually does, but her voice is still mesmerizing."
5,Mariah Carey is the BEST,Mariah Carey did the best performance on this CD. She has a beautiful voice and if your thinking of buying it than I totally reccomend it! If you never heard of Mariah Carey listen to this CD or a different CD and you'll immediately become a BIG fan!
2,I agree with J.Sell,If you pay this much you should not have to stick the stickers on your self.And my stickers did not even stick so I had to get glue dots to hold the stickers on.
1,It randomly shuts off,"This mouse worked fine for the first few months that we had it. (It was maybe four months or so.) And I really like that it has five programmable buttons, and scrolling abilities. But, it randomly shuts off. And when it does, it makes it so that the keyboard (which is a different brand) no longer works as well. We then need to restart the computer, and cannot save any work that is currently on-screen. This is infinitely frustrating. The mouse gives no warning of when it is going to shut off, it may do so recently after the computer has been restarted, it may do so days after the computer has been restarted."
2,Optical Mice Too Fragile for Extended Use,"I run a lab environment in a university and we acquired about 20 of these mice earlier this year. Sadly, they haven't held up over time. While I haven't had students complain about some of the other criticism mentioned in these reviews (too big, too many easily clicked buttons), more than 50% of them have stopped working or only work sporadically. The problem seems to be that the wiring in the mouse ""tail"", at its point of connection with the mouse, breaks after extended use, rendering it pretty much useless.On the other hand, I use one on my home computer, where it gets less frequent and easier wear and haven't had a problem yet. The upshot is, if you're a heavy duty mouser, or have machines that get hard and constant use, the Intellimouse simply won't last."
5,The Best Product Microsoft has produced...is a mouse?,"Let's face it, the best Microsoft Products are not versions of Windows, but its hardware peripherals. Microsoft's Joystick, the Sidewinder, a very good product. And now an optical mouse for consumers (engineers have been using for years). I can say with the highest degree of confidence that THIS Microsoft product actually works! And you get precise mouse movement in return for what looks like a hefty price for a mouse. But you get four buttons, and a wheel. And it will probably outlast ten trackball mice. Your choice."
1,too large to be comfortable,Doesn't matter how wonderful the motion etc.. this mouse is the largest size I've ever seen and is VERY uncomfortable... i've junked it.
3,GREAT MOUSE - SCROLL WHEEL NOT A THRILL!,"I purchased this mouse which was highly recommended by all my friends. I do enjoy and like it very much, BUT, I am not comfortable with the scroll wheel. It is very clicky and does not glide easy and smooth as my old Logitech wheel mouse did. I feel that Microsoft should of did a little more research and surveys on the feel and comfort of the scroll wheel. All in all, a good mouse and I am glad I purchased it! Also, I wish the cord was NOT black and they made it cream/white to blend in with most PC's and keyboards."
1,An unconventional mouse and far from perfect,"(judge a mouse by how it works, not how it looks) I purchased this Microsoft product from Amazon.com with the expectation of never having to clean a mouse trackball again. That requirement was met but the rest of the mouse falls short. The first thing you notice is that it's an oversized mouse. Many people, including myself, prefer a smaller profile. Second, its tracking ability is very poor. If I try to move it in a straight line it will jiggle slightly from side to side. VERY ANNOYING! Third, and probably the worst feature is that the wheel which replaces the middle button is too sensitive to downward motion. I had it set to give a double-click but had to disable it. Alas, this mouse is more a gimmick than an advancement of the mouse species. If you want a good, solid wheelmouse then buy a Logitech. As we say in Texas, ""nuff said""!"
2,"The good, the bad...","Cool looks do nothing to hide the faults in this lackluster mouse from Microsoft.Sure, the optical technology provides a smooth performance, and the left and right side-buttons are useful, but...The Microsoft Intellimouse is in no way ergonomic for either right-hand or left-hand and does nothing to eliminate wrist strain. Of course, I do have larger-than-average hands.The biggest drawback that I have found with almost all Microsoft Mouse devices is that after a week or so, the left-click button gets sticky. Even in the most sanitary and pure environments, the button tends to stick down or not respond at all. This was true of the original Microsoft Mouse and is true of the Intellimouse as well. After replacing this mouse twice, I gave up and went back to my trusty Logitech Mouseman.Hopefully some day Microsoft might figure out how to fix the left-click button problem that has been occuring since they first started making mice."
2,IV'E HAD PROBLEMS!,"I bought a Intellemouse when they first came out. I said cool, started liking it, because when your a top online gamer in the world, you need a smooth mouse. I really liked it, but then the wires started coming loose and now it doesn't work. I took it apart to see what the problem was and that was it, but didnt know where they went. If you are a gamer, dont get this. We tend to tug on the cables while moving."
2,What a tragic,"I must admit, I loved this mouse. Until it started to go erratic on me. I have had this mouse for only about a year, and I am very easy on electronics. Sometimes, it just doesnt work at all, or it would freeze for a second or two and start working again every few minutes. I expected more as far as quality goes considering the price of the unit. I am converting to Logitech."
5,Very nice Feel,I was having a lot of pain in my wrist because of the trackman I was using. This mouse has taken away the pain and feels great in the palm of my hand. At first I was unsure of the shape and if worth the price. It feels great and the mouse moves great on almost all surfaces. The most important thing about it is the feel it is great. It reduces the stain and your hand can cup the mouse and make using it worth while.The shape and feel are different. It may take some time to get used to but the feel and precision is well worth the extra money.
3,"Does its job, to an extent.","Yes, I'm one of the many people to own this mouse. I don't know if it was my own experience, and if it was a peculiar one at that, but after having owned two MS IntelliMouse Explorers, I'm not too satisfied.Sure, they serve their purpose in pointing and clicking, but after a year, the first stopped working. So I bought another, because I liked the manliness of how huge the mouse was.It was great. The navigation buttons were right at my thumb, and the red light made it possible for me to see in the dark (to an extent!).But as I should have seen coming, after a year passed, it stopped working as it used to. It randomly stops responding, as another reviewer said, and this would get really annoying. I don't know how long the life expectancy is with these things, but I cannot see myself buying another one of these ever again.Again, it may be my own personal bad experience with this mouse, but I do not recommend this mouse."
1,Disappointing Performance,"Running this artfully-crafted mouse over 7 different surfaces produced very disappointing results. On most surfaces, the mouse would only track reliably if the ""grain"" ran directly parallel or perpendicular to the up/down orientation. Even my existing *mousepad* performed badly. Even more surprisingly, so did plain white copier (laser printer) paper. With the mouse only slightly out of perfect up/down position on the surface, the pointer would jump and ""jiggle"" in 40- to 250-plus pixel areas on the screen. Roughly the same symptoms as a mouse badly in need of a cleaning.I tried this mouse for a week, and even exchanged it at the store (suspecting a defect), but was unable to get it to work reliably. Sadly, I'm now back with my old ball-and-chain.Maybe one day Microsoft will get the algorithm a bit more iron-clad (and hopefully, create a cordless version)."
1,Mouse destined to DIE,"It seems like Microsoft designed these mice with planned obselesence (meaning they are designed to quit working after a while so you will buy another then another then another) It should be a piece of cake to design a mouse that has no moving parts so that it lasts virtually forever... I have heard from several people about their microsoft mice quitting working and for the reason previously mentioned, I laughed at them saying that they were probably yanking the cord or something. These people had gone through 1,2, and even 3 of these mice. But then mine died... I bought a different brand optical and have been quite happy so far. Save your self A LOT of money and don't buy this mouse."
3,"Looks good, Feels cheap","First thing I noticed when I took it out of the package was how flimsy it felt. I have bought microsoft mice before and thier track ball had a strong solid feel. This mouse however feels thin and inexpensive. I tried using it without a mouse pad but it seems to make a bit of noise sliding on my desk, it has little hard plastic pads to slide on but they don't seem to be enough to silince it, maybee its cause of the thin cheap feeling case.As far as usability, It works as described. It's a bit larger than a standard mouse, but that keeps your hand from draging on the desk much. It also tracks just fine and has lots of options for it's 6 buttons and scroll wheel. Overall I'm ok with it, just wished it felt more confident."
1,nope..,i could only use this one for two weeks.. it is too huge and has a strange shape.. do not buy it before try..!
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the video very much. The gardens are beautiful, the music is lovely and the quotations were narrated very well. All in all the first viewing was just what I expected. However, I viewed it a second time on another player before scheduling a viewing at a garden club meeting and was very disapointed that the DVD kept getting ""stuck"". Needless to say I will plan something else for my next garden club meeting at my home. I do not think it was a problem with the second player since the last video I watched on it had no problem. It may have been an isolated problem with that particular DVD. I have not made up my mind whether to reorder in the hopes of getting one without flaws."
2,Not a movie for people sensitive to sexual violence,I stopped watching during the protracted rape scene. It was deeply painfull to watch and I felt gratuitous for the film makers to include.
2,"Nice scenery, story is lacking","Based on what we've seen in the film, Rob Roy's honor is the most important thing to him. But does that mean that cunnying, intelligence, leverage, and knowledge is to be discarded? Rob Roy does everything wrong in this film from the moment he allows one man to act has his financial agent to the fact that he doesn't use his allies against those that are trying to kill him and who end up raping his wife, he acts in typical Hollywood fashion as an idiot.The film would have been quite short if he would have done the right thing from the very beginning. But, alas, we would have no film so hence the stupidity from which we are tortured.The film has some great scenery and the acting is enjoyable except for the brutal rape scene of Roy's wife. Other than the scenery and acting, there's not much to see let alone giving cause to buying the DVD."
4,the DVD is very grainy,"I like the movie allot, but this has to be the grainiest DVD I have ever seen. This movie deserved a better DVD transfer."
5,What's not to like?,"A wonderful film overshadowed by ""the other"" kilt movie that came out that same year, Rob Roy is stuffed with action and romance and political intrigue. Brilliant performances by Liam, Jessica, and especially Tim Roth and a then unknown Brian McCardie. Brian gives a stunning debut performance as Rob's younger brother Alistair (who, though he didn't exist in real life, sure made for great cinema!). A great story that will have you weeping and pining for the highlands!"
2,T.V. version was better,I did not watch all of this video but remember the rape scene that made this movie unforgettable. In this movie rental like most good movies the scenes that were most ex-stream have been changed. The T. V. version was more graphic and intense.I would buy this movie only if it was like the T.V. version which it is not! It is still a good movie but less dramatic.
4,Rob Roy is another sad page from human history.,"I loved Rob Roy. The acting was great, the story tragic, and not because someone dies, but because it exemplifies the cruelty of the British rule on Scotland one more time. Braveheart it wasn't, because Rob Roy didn't have the impact that William Wallace had, but it was a story closer to the humans that we are. It angered me, because I couldn't help them. It saddened me, because of their pain.Good movie, bad taste in the mouth for the evil perpetrated by British rule."
5,"Cocker Revisits Classic Songs, Improves Them","Most of the songs on ""Organic"" have been recorded previously by Cocker, but in almost every case he improves upon the original. He even adds a new verse to ""You Are So Beautiful"". The arrangements are stripped down and emphasize acoustic intruments, so the overall effect is like an ""unplugged"" album, although instead of a rough ""live"" sound this is a very well-produced, polished album. There are also a few selections that, as far as I know, have not previously been recorded by Cocker, such as ""High Lonesome Blue"" or Van Morrison's ""Into The Mystic"". The highlight is ""Can't Find My Way Home"", but the fact is, almost every song here would be a highlight on most of his other albums. This is my favorite Joe Cocker album, and if you already have many of these songs in your collection from other albums, please don't let that deter you, you'll really like what he does with those old favorites here."
1,Does not work for me!,"I bought this so I could use a DVI cable and hook my PC to my TV. I had been using a VGA cable with an adapter on my PC, but wanted to push my TV so it was flush with the entertainment center (the DVI to VGA cable prevented this as it was on the back of the PC) This cable would have been perfect if it had worked! I tried several DVI cables that I knew worked, and no signal at all. I am returning this to Amazon today..."
1,Didn't work for MBP,"Bought this for connecting my Early-2011 Macbook Pro to a display (via the standard Apple VGA adapter). Didn't get any signal, no settings or anything got this thing to work."
3,Not the X-Wing Set you Really Want,"This set pails in comparison the the X-Wing Ultimate Collector's set. If you've seen that X-Wing model, you won't be happy with this one. If you are purchasing as an actual play toy, I guess this would be the better choice but the price is too steep IMHO."
2,Not so thrilled,Despite following the directions this does not play well thru my receiver. The quality going into the computer is not so good either. Ok at low volume but if you turn it up at all it is pretty rough. I didn't find the software that great at cleaning up noise. If I had it to do over again I would buy a regular turntable and hook it to the computer as an input device.
5,Great,"This is great I have been transfering all my albums to CDS and puting on my mp3 player. I have not heard a lot of this songs for a long time. This is great to take out sounds,and scratches."
4,Well worth the price,"I've seen other products out there that record vinyl to digital for $400, and this system is better quality, and more flexible for a fraction of that price. The learning curve on the software isn't too bad, but that first recording is going to be time consuming."
1,Operator Error?,"Regarding the software: I cannot get the record levels to increase. Everything sounds fine as it is playing/recording, but the recorded file is barely audible. I followed the instructions (such as they are) for this problem in the ""Help"" file, but to no avail. Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but even so... the second day I had the system the turntable ceased to turn at the correct speeds. 33 & 1/3 LPS turned at about 30 rpm and 45's at about 42, totally ruining the sound in both cases."
4,Happy happy,"Works easily and produces what to our ears is great sound. Had some difficulty with heavily scratched records, skipping and not moving on from the track -- but that would be expected with any but the most expensive, recording studio type, of turntables and playing arms.We did not use the recording software that came with the package."
4,Audio Technica AT-LP2D LP-to-Digital Recording System,"Products were recieved in excellent condition in a strong box/foam.The software is user friendly. The resulting CDs I created are better than the LP records, as most of the LP imperfections can be removed with the software."
4,First rate research.,"Prof. Roller's scholarship and research is first rate. She goes further than any prior work on Cybele in the deconstruction of the misunderstandings and poor research that has dominated this subject for more than a hundred years.While I feel she misses many important connections in her effort to undo the poor research of the past, her book stands today as the single best source of accurate information on the subject of Magna Mater, Cybele to date. This book is the place to start a personal inquiry on the subject."
1,purchased for one song only,"I bought this item for one song only. the theme from brian's song. I honestly haven't listened to the other songs. mr.mathis has a smooth, soothing voice. I will with time allows listen to the rest of the cd."
2,Vacuous,"The substance of this book could be reduced to about 10 pages of text...the rest is just fluff and filler. It reads like a term paper, where the writer is trying to find SOMETHING to fill the space with. The author overreaches. Yes, there are a few nuggets in here, but the same information is available in more useful format elsewhere."
2,"Overpacked, understuffed. I was left wanting","The author takes his understanding of his subject more seriously than the task at hand: Showing us why we should care to read about this guy. It seems Jon Lee Anderson gets a little too caught up in some of the hero worship and recounting Che's luck with the ladies instead of showing how this guy rose to be such an effective leader and a powerful influence in the world. The book seems to be a series of adventures - Che helping lepers, Che on a motorcycle, Che and his revolutionary guerilla buddies - rather than an exploration into the evolution of one of recent history's most interesting people.If you want to actually know more about the guy, pick up some of the editions of his own journals. They'll get you the closest."
5,Very good read on an interesting figure.,"Jon Lee Anderson's book on Che is a great and interesting read on a very controversial figure. In some ways, he humanizes Che and brings a contemporary view to his life that is enriching for understanding him and his ideals. I suggest it with the highest respect for Anderson and his thorough research and dynamic prose."
3,Che Guevara,I purchased the book because I wanted to know more about Che Guevara after watching Motorcycle Diaries. The book is a very detailed account which is fine if you are looking for an in depth study. If you are looking more for a summary of his life journey and the contribution he made to humanity I think you will find it a little heavy going.
3,Definitely not a hero to me...,"I decided to read this b/c of all the hoopla over the years. I was surprised to find how well read Che was, impressed that he had become a doctor, encouraged that he recognized inequality and wanted to do something about it. That's where the good stuff ends for me. I am horrified at his methods to try to reach his ends. I found him to be confusing in his general lack of respect for women and his own lack of control over his personal desires. He used people and lied often and was proud of the fact. Nothing of this adds up to me to make a hero. Even Ghandi, although he failed in his personal life at times, exemplfied more consistency in his beliefs and actions than Che ever did. I think the book was well written and I found it interesting but I definitely feel it is biased. Having said that, I don't hate Che but I will never idolize him."
1,The narrator spoiled the fun of listening to a good book,"I think the book has a lot of merit and I should have been very satisfied with listening to it. But, as Spanish is my native tongue, the horrendous pronunciation of Spanish names by the narrator was extremely irritant, spoiling my listening experience. Obviously, the man is too arrogant or ignorant (possible both) to bother to ask how to pronounce spanish names. Also at fault is the production of the audiobook. This is a very unprofessional attitude just due to this fact I wouldn't recommend hearing this audiobook to anybody whose mother tongue is Spanish."
1,Don't Forget the Puppy,"If and when you decide to waste your money on this account, don't forget to place a bookmark on the pages describing Che's slow suffocation of a friendly puppy that his team had adopted as a mascot. PETA folks should especially love this part - following their recent adoption of his granddaughter as a new spokesperson. Oh, yes, a lovable, dashing, iconic figure for the Hollywood left and sad, pathetic revolutionaries from the past."
4,The complete bio of El Che,"Aha, here you go, the full bio of El CheThe man, the myth, the child, the revolutionary, the father, the friend, every aspect of Che's life is mentioned and well presented. one thing that bothered me is that the book is really sophisticated (it's a hard read), so you need to concentrateEnjoy"
3,TOO MUCH!!!!,"This is certainly an incredible well-researched and detailed book, but I just didn't feel that Che Guevara's life merited 800 pages. Despite his iconic image, he was really just a minor figure in the history of Communism, and this book did nothing to change my mind, despite the mind-numbing amount of information provided."
5,Che and his life/Cuban revolution,Very interesting review of a very interesting person. the writeup details the Cuban revolution and the role played by Che and Fidel. Very detailed and good reading. I have traveled to Cuba 4 times and this book provides insight on the revolution.
2,"Started out OK, then got stupid.","The title says it all. Hoped that this movie would at least be entertaining, and it was at first. Then all the cliches, and miraculous stunts became too much."
5,Great Movie,"If you like Mark Wahlberg, you will love this movie. If you rent it on Amazon, you don't have to worry about smuggling your own candy into the theater."
3,Less than I expected,"I'm on the fence with this one. The base story was good but there were too many if's, whats, and you've got to be kidding aspects of the film to flip me over the fence. But, I like Wahlberg and would probably recommend it."
2,Ho-hum,"Lots of buildup to a predictable ending... hokey plot... and rip off of other movies (""Heat"" and I think ""Once Upon a Time in America"" ... can't remember movie, but without spoiling anything, there's a way they sink their cargo and then bring it to the surface again.)"
1,Don't waste your time (or money)...,"This is the worst Mark Wahlberg film ever. If you want to understand why you shouldn't buy it try renting it instead. Besides, this isn't the the type of movie you would watch more than once, and some won't make it all the way through the first time. I've enjoyed most of his films, but not this one."
4,It's not bad,"There's nothing really new in this movie, it's not mind blowing, it's marginally suspenseful in moments, much of it is unbelievable & too good to be true, but it's not bad. I'd recommend watching it on a boring day."
1,Formulaic and Silly,"To put it simply, if you've seen Gone in 60 Seconds then just replace the cars with cash/drugs and you have Contraband. It's a ridiculous movie that, unlike Gone in 60, doesn't know when to have fun with itself but is unwilling to actually commit to being a more realistic movie either. What you get is Mark Walburg being the typical tough guy he loves to play in a movie so gutlessly predictable that you'll actually find yourself wishing you were watching Nicholas Cage or even Jason Statham instead. Towards the end of the movie they have a very real chance to get some emotion out of Walburg's character from the audience, even if the circumstances that lead there are frankly comedic, instead they turn what could have been a very real tragedy into a miracle the defies modern science."
2,Way Too Long & Not Enough Kate,"My foolish baboon of a bride Bessie has always had a thing for Marky Mark. He's usually pretty good when he's not singing and he's decent in this movie as he does a good job as the duped reformed criminal gone good gone bad gone good to support the Mask lookalike baby brother of the stupidly blonde (and everhot) Kate Beckinsale. Boom boom boom, but no matter. The movie is too darn long, too unbelievable, and there is nowhere near enough Kate to make up for the 107 minutes of stupidity and boredom. Not recommended."
3,OK,"I wish I could have given this 2 1/2 stars, I think to go as high as three is a stretch. But, with that said, it's not the worst marky mark movie I have seen."
3,less then expected,"What can you say about a Mark Wahlberg movie? Exciting, full of action? Well it's not here. To me it's rather slow paced and uneventful. The ending was better then the whole of the movie. It looked better in the previews. If you want a good movie from Mark try 3 kings, or Four Brothers, both are exceptional. As for this one, if its really cheap, then get it or rent it first."
4,Good talent,"Contraband wasn't a great movie ,yet you'll find it enjoyable. When they made this movie they did it without a lot of sex and using the F word to get a point across throughout the movie. It had a plot and to the point which is refreshing in this day and age. I'm glad I watched it,even after seeing it only had a 3 star rating."
3,3.5 Stars. Good Underrated Action Film.,"Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) is an ex-smuggler who works installing security alarms and lives a peaceful life with his wife, Kate (Kate Beckinsale), and their two sons in New Orleans. One day, Chris and Kate learn that her brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) was smuggling drugs, but was forced to drop them into the Mississippi River in order to avoid arrest during a surprise inspection by U.S. Customs. Andy's boss, ruthless mobster Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi), is infuriated and demands repayment.The plot was good and the acting wasn't bad but there were too many slow parts for an action/thriller, although it does get more intense towards the end. They went to the extreme with language just to get an R rating, if they reduced the language a bit than it could easily be PG-13. Contraband isn't a must see but it's a step above average and keeps your interest throughout."
1,NOT good,My wife and I were not impressed.....it did not hold our attention. I guess there's a reason you never heard anything about this movie when it was in theaters. The trailer was better than the movie.
3,contraband,It was an alright movie could of been better classic marky mark movie. Hopefully his movies in the future are better
3,Rompus Ride,"Contraband is a fun, rompus ride. If you're looking for something fresh and new, it is not that. Contraband feels like several other movies with some new packaging. It doesn't quite have the edge-of-your-seat fun of Shooter, but it's still a great option if you're a Wahlberg fan and action junkie."
4,contraband,"I am a Mark Wahlberg fan.Goes without saying. I rented this movie thru Amazon fully expecting to see your typical action movie. I was wrong. Got a short lesson in the dirty side of smuggling. While it does not dwell on right or wrong, it does show a little about why/how and the efforts of goverments to stop it. A few twists and turns really spiced it up and reminded me of the Italian Job with surprises. Acting was intense and well done by everyone."
1,its really bad,"Wow, its really bad. Bad acting and story line. don't waste your money.I just wish i can rate this less than one star."
1,Disappointing,"The movie took around two days to download to my iPad. When I say ""two days"" I don't mean it took a long time, and I got impatient. I starting downloading it to watch it on an international trip. It took around 48 hours to download. I wrote to Amazon customer service to complain, but I was already out of town when they responded asking for the title of the movie I was complaining about. It slipped my mind until now and it's probably too late to do anything now. It's the second time I had an issue and I don't think I will ever use the service again."
3,The Mrs,"Storey's guide to beef was more organized and better written. This was kind of bird brained (excuse the pun). However, I do know a lot more about chickens and their needs than before. I would've rather had more ideas on building the coops rather than recipes. Still worth the read though for beginners."
5,My favorite chicken raising book,"If I could only have one chicken raising book,this might be it! It covers breeding, raising chicks, hatching eggs...even butchering! Very useful."
4,A Definite Page Turner,"Multiple personality disorder is the subject of this Sheldon work and it is nothing short of outstanding. The story centers around the character of serene Ashley Patterson, 28 year old graphic artist at a company called Global Computer Graphics. Toni Prescott is 22 years old with a powerful desire to stir things up and live on the edge. Alette Peters is a low-key type personality always trying to keep Toni from blowing up but in the end, giving into whatever Toni says. As the story unfolds and Ashley's memory takes on more and more black holes, the reader realizes that this is a dire situation, involving murder, that may be next to impossible to correct. Sheldon takes us deep into the minds of the three personalities and keeps us on the edge of our seats to see ""what happens next,"" never knowing who will prevail. In the words of a familiar children's song, ""pop! goes the weasel"" - you'll have to read the book to understand the real meaning of this phrase."
2,"3 stars for the 1st half, 0 for the ending.","I usually love Sidney Sheldon, but this book was a major disappointment for me. I flew through the first half, thinking it was going to be a great read, but the last half was a complete let down. I hope he goes back to his surprise endings like in his older books."
3,Not a typical Sidney Sheldon Novel,"This particular SS book is not one that I would recommend. I contend that Memories of Midnight was the last book that Sidney Sheldon actually wrote. Everything after that book was penned by someone using SS ideas. I believe that Tell Me Your Dreams was written many years earlier. See page 201 in the hard cover edition. Even though this setting is in the present, the piece of equipment named on the aforementioned page is from the past, thus substantiating my point. I completed the book only because I had started reading it."
1,Not his finest effort,"Sheldon skimps on characters and action in favor of a lengthy discourse on Multiple Personality Disorder. The main character, a woman on trial for murder, is totally eclipsed by the public and private life of her attorney. The book loses focus and stumbles from hospitals to courtrooms. Avoid this one, a mere contractual obligation for Sheldon."
3,Entertaining and preposterous low-brow reading,"I travel a lot, so I read a lot of Sheldon to pass the time in airports. This is definitely one of the more fantastically crazy thrillers, albeit based on a ""real"" story and medical condition. Where Ashley finds the time, even unconsciously, to hone her skills as a Broadway-level entertainer, a potential Picasso, a trilinguist AND a computer whiz is beyond me. Talk about getting laid constantly even when she doesn't want to! Some of the affairs are believable but really, a sheriff devoted to his dying wife who sees her naked and just HAS to do it to her in her sleep? Ewwww...and Sheldon sure likes his ""tough black woman judges"" (see Nothing Lasts Forever).But one doesn't expect classic lit here, rather escapist fun. Although I do think some of Sheldon's other works (Master of the Game, other earlier stuff) were better crafted."
1,What a terrible first impression!,This was my first Sidney Sheldon book and it will definitely be my last. Sheldon does not pique the reader's interest one iota...he merely drags you along for a rather unenjoyable and uninteresting ride. This book was incredibly simple minded and predictable. It lacked a flair for detail that I believe a best selling novel should have. Very slow and sloppy. Don't waste your money.
5,Sidney Sheldon Writes An MPD Story With A Masterful Hand,"Ashley Patterson seems like any normal woman, but beneath her lovely exterior lies many secrets to behold, and a terror that she has trouble accepting. Once Ashley sees the whole story, another ghost from the past enters to bring to light why her life has turned out like it has. Her father, Dr. Patterson, stands behind his daughter through the whole story, reminding her that she is all he has. Is he as heartless as he seems, or is he just trying to cover up a past from long ago that still haunts his daughter's life?Tell Me Your Dreams is an intricately woven story with surprise twists and turns, revelations that make one wonder, and the brutal murders of innocent men, all due to one man's abnormal passions that link Ahsley, Toni, and Alette together in a fiendish nightmare."
4,Slightly unpredictable,I thought this book was very good. I was continuously surprised at all its twists and turns. I couldn't put it down!
3,Very good book even though you had to think twice in the end,"I liked this book, even though ti was a little confusing in the end, i had to go back to the beginning and read a little more carefully to really understand. but, yepp, the book was sure different than what i've expected in the end.***"
4,An alternative view.,"This is an excellent 'documentary styled' video that presents an alternative but balanced view on the Moorish period in Spain's turbulent history.Worth adding to any video collection. Entertaining and educational with excellent views of the magnificent Alhambra and Andalucian cities, all of which should be on the top of your 'must visit list'."
4,Funny mockumentary about rap groups of the 80s and 90s,"Although vulgar and possibly racist depending on your view, this is still a funny take on 80s and 90s rap groups. If you like movies such as Spinal Tap, this is the rap equivalent."
1,Weak Jokes Poorly Stitched Together by Weaker Story,"Don't waste your time with this third-rate imitation. All you'll get is a story that feels like it was desperately rushed through in order to create a patina of context for a few limp gags--with the humor spelled out for you after the punchline has been delivered. If it's a hip-hop ""This Is Spinal Tap"" you're looking for, get ""CB-4"" instead."
5,Its about time!!,"This is definitely the funniest of the last decades ""mockumentary"". Writer and actor Rusty Cundieff skewers a handful of the early 90's rappers. LL Cool J, PM Dawn and C+C Music Factory take a beating. The film is crisp but over eager at times. Thankfully this doesnt affect the movie's flow. A little humor seems dated, but this is still an incredibly funny movie. With characters named ""Tone Def"" or ""Tastey Taste"", how can you go wrong."
3,This is not what it seems to be,I have read the front cover and from that alone I purchased the book. The problem is that you can't trust the text on the cover. This book does not give any indepth coverage or analysis of anything to do with ADO .NET. What really puzzles me is the literally hundreds of figures; what's the purpose of these? I am disappointed that this book is not what it promises. The XML coverage is quite good but the rest is just not good. look else where for real ADO .NET coverage.
4,Excellent Resource!,Fantastic resource for anyone interested in purchasing a timeshare. Good information (although a bit dated) and excellent resources are listed for more up-to-date info.
4,"Unbiased, But Didn't Convince Me","I just finished reading the book and found it unbiased, but it still didn't convince me to buy a timeshare, new or used. Maybe I'm not the kind of person that would benefit from a timeshare, because I stay in one place for one or two days at the most, and then move on. I have friends who own a timeshares in Orlando, Palm Springs and Las Vegas who are very happy with them. I don't know what all the other comments are about, because I felt the book to be unbiased and very consumer friendly. Perhaps the other reviews were written by other timeshare salespersons. I've always found timeshare salespersons to be ""know it alls"" and they always tried to make me feel stupid. Maybe this book is scaring them? Anyway, nice book, what I expected from a Dummies book."
5,I love it!,"I used my blanket for the first time at my daughter's soccer game - it was pouring rain the entire time. The fleece side stayed dry and I stayed warm. It's lightweight and easy to fold and carry around. It's a great price and a good value. I would definitely recommend it for outdoor sporting events, especially in a wet climate."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book to shed some light on some food preparation and storage beliefs and perhaps better understand why some things work together and why others don't. Since the author was a chemist, I was expecting a clearly stated hypothesis and conclusion in each chapter. Instead, each chapter read like a movie review. (Where at the end, you still don't know if the movie was good or bad). It was deep on explanations, but short on clear conclusions to the hypothesis proposed. I am well educated with a technical background, and still found the reading a little challenging."
4,Trick in the kitchen,This hardcover is divided in small paragraphs which are dealing with the different topics in kitchen science. The first section is dedicated to the tricks in cooking and is the one I like better. Then the author goes through the new discoveries about how do we perceive taste and flavour.Good start to get in the argument of molecular gastronomy;)
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping to find something along the lines of Harold McGee's ""On Food and Cooking"". If this is what you are looking for, look elsewhere."
4,Herve This,Packed w/ lots of information for serious cooks. Sometimes difficult to understand what he's talking about.
4,Great Jingle,"I discovered ""The Walkmen"" after hearing ""We Have Been Had"" in a Saturn Ion commercial. After a few days of not being able to get the jingle out of my head, I did some research, found the name of the band, and purchased the CD.I was pleasantly surprised to find that the entire CD is just as catchy and infectious as the song that led me to buy the recording. I recommend taking a listen."
1,SLOW SLOW SLOW Delivery,15 calendar days to ship a pocket book from the vendor to the buyer! Pony Express would be faster.
3,Buenos Aires Helper,"This book has a great deal of very helpful information on the sights to see. As the value of the Argentine peso has improved, the prices are somewhat higher but still excellent value. The least helpful part of the book was the dining section. We found a number of the restaurants were no longer there. However, for those that were still around, the reviews were very accurate."
5,Take This Authors Advice,"I have read this book at least 6 times in the past 15 years and it gets better each time I read it. I always find some newgold nugget I didn't pickup the last time I read it.Zig Ziglar use to sell cookware door to door. And his knowledge and techniques he shares in this book are not rehashed from hearsay but from actual experiences of his climb to the top. If you want to keep climbing to the top(in wealth, health, and happiness)this book is a must read!! By the way, in life, there's always another step to take to get to the top of the mountain in our journey of life. This book can help you get there."
2,Don't waste your time,"If this is Furst's best novel.......I don't want to read his worst. I'm currently about halfway through this book, and reading it is a painful chore. It is certainly atmospheric, and there are a few minor positive points......but I can't keep myself from thinking about how many French references are found in this book......it gets laborious after awhile.I'm sorry I bought it."
2,Didactic,"Sorry -- a quick judgment. I only read a bit. The author seems very inent, and heavy-handedly so, on filling us in on details of Hungarian culture. This gave every sign of weighing the plot down so that it could barely move. Two of the principals are having lunch in a seedy cafe. They talk about a friend who died and they take the opportunity to review Hungarian customs and beliefs surrounding dealing with the dead. Of course, we will pay close attention to their eating habits, too -- equally well researched. If I were very particularly interested in or attached to things Hungarian, I might like this, and I can imagine sensible people who would enjoy it, but it isn't what I was after."
2,Furst phoned it in,I am a fan of Alan Furst but this one is pathetic. Not so much a novel as a pastiche of research notes. I had to force myself to get through it. Sorry to say it looks as if Furst is coasting all the way to the bank.
4,Furst Continues to Deliver,"Though perhaps not quite up to the standard of ""The Polish Officer"", this is a wonderful book. The visit to the Czech fortress is haunting, as much for the way it is set up and described, as for the realization it creates of just how many opportunities the West missed to stop Hitler in his tracks before 1939.Can't wait to see Furst's next effort."
1,Bought by accident,"I bought this for my Kindle by mistake and had it deleted. I may order is sometime, but not now, so any comment now lacks validity."
5,It's great!,"I looove Mickey Mouse and I have this along with the business card holder and pen holder; they look just beautiful on my desk!! In my opinion, I would not buy this for my small kids, probably for 12 and over... However, I don't think they are designed for kids because if they were designed for kids you would not have a business card holder within the collection... right?"
3,okay,It is enjoyable to imagine the history involved in this story. However I feel the sex scenes are cheesy and low class. I am not sure if I would recommend this to anyone.
3,Pretty period piece,"I would never expect Showtime to produce first rate historical drama. That is not what they do. Showtime is in the business of slick entertainment, and that's exactly what they've given us in The Tudors. With the exception of PBS and, at times, The History Channel, it is fatuous to count on the entertainment industry to teach us history.Viewed as mere entertainment, The Tudors is a success. It's got visual impact, conspiracy, treachery, sex, arrogance, and power plays. And beautiful people in all the important roles. Television so often offers so little in the way of compelling programing that this series is a welcome way to while away a rainy evening. But for true Tudor history, find a good book."
3,Attractively filmed series but historically glamorized.,"While I enjoyed the style of this miniseries and likely will watch future seasons of it, as a Anglo-history buff, some of the glamorizations done to the facts (or complete misconstruing of the facts to make for better drama) bothered me.Others have mentioned all the historical inaccuracies, and they do abound. Still hopefully this series will entice folks to look deeper into the actual history.My recommendation to anyone seeking really good drama on Henry VIII that combines with good history is watch ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" with Keith Michell. This drama is nowhere near that calibre, though it has the advantage of gorgeous filming."
2,Don't waste your money.,Completely disappointing. I can't believe that this is the same actor-- Jonathan Rhys Meyers-- who was in Match Point (Woody Allen).
3,Tudors 1 - Fact or Fiction,"I have now viewed all of the first series, well, there is now doubt the emphasis is on sexual content, rather than historic content.It may be that the historical content is so well known, that they had to do something to make it interesting!Why, did they have to make a show of the king masturbating into a towel held by one of his man servants!!!That aside, the costumes were stunning and the casting was excellent.If you want to watch a softporn series, great, go for it.I await the second series with anticipation . . .Just to see if the producers can come up with something interesting in the story line, if they dare!"
2,A sudsy try at tarting up history,"This show is not good history and only intermittently interesting as soap opera. Some of the actors play interesting characters, but they should have all sat down and watched ""Fire over England"" together to get a better idea of how people used to act at court.If it wasn't for all the graphic sex scenes, you might think it was some sort of school series intent on slooowly grinding through the details of the early reign of King Henry VIII of england. Except that even a California native like myself can spot the inaccuracies in the history of a place far away and long ago.I've walked the halls and park of Hampton Court myself on holiday and it was fun to spot the scenes that take place there. In fact, there are several plays put on in the series in those halls that I enjoyed very much.Not enough to make up for the other 9 hours and fifty minutes of the first season, however."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting a historical dramatic series, but this was more about a romp in bed than anything else. It just wasn't what we were looking for."
1,Inaccuratehistory and terrible acting,"This series caters to people who want history served up on a sexy dish, and nothing else. The Henry VIIIth portrayal is crucial, but we get a thin, short specimen of a Henry, and loud, exclamatory rantings, with a lot of sexual interplay. This series ignores the history of the sisters of Henry VIII, and also depicts one of them in a completely inaccurate way.This is Tudor life as run through the off the top of head e-mails on religion, history, geography, and politics we get so much of these days.This series should be titled ""the Renaissance: The Declining Years,"" aptly applied to the modern world as well as the series it spawned."
1,Menus are INCREDIBLY annoying!,"I'm giving this one star for the frickin' menus, which they couldn't have made more difficult to navigate if they were trying to torture the user. I almost put my fist through my new high def display when I got the umpteenth ""This operation prohibited by disc"" message just trying to get to the main menu to select an episode. Clearly they didn't test this on actual humans to determine its ease of use.The show itself is OK, with decent acting in most roles. There are, of course, historical inaccuracies for the sake of drama, and numerous times when the dialog sounds anachronistic. The cinematography is gorgeous, and it looks great in high def."
2,"This Sure Ain't ""A Man for All Seasons""","I just finished Season 1. Anyone genuinely interested in gauging the historical value of this series must be forewarned to keep the ""fast forward"" button handy. There are numerous pornographic scenes, which serve only to celebrate Henry VIII's immoral behaviors.While Catherine of Aragon & Saint (Bishop) John Fisher seem to - thus far - get respectful treatment, Saint (Sir) Thomas More seems to be getting portrayed as a religious fanatic. Jeremy Northam's Thomas More is barely recognizable as the same manplayed by Paul Sofield, as possessing a flawless, articulate brilliance and magnificent strength of character - surpassed only by his faith in God.On a much more mundane note, it is difficult to tell how much time is supposed to have passed from the first to the last episode."
3,"Fun, but not to be mistaken for actual history","Engrossing and spectacularly produced, to be enjoyed as entertainment, not history, as it contains many errors of fact. For instance, the writers throw in a couple of completely fabricated homosexual affairs, seemingly just for the hell of it. And a fabricated murder of a royal, married to the (historically) wrong princess. And some of the timelines are messed up. And the series starts with the murder of someone who wasn't murdered. And completely wrong on a suicide and someone going crazy.But, due to its contemporary feel, it succeeds in getting the viewer interested in this period of history, if nothing more than to check up on its accuracy."
1,ZERO STARS FOR THE SOFT-PORN VERSION OF HENRY VIII,"This show is absolutely disgusting in every sense of the word. it's inaccurate, ridiculous, rubbish and with a sex scene every 5 minutes it just gets worse. Please, we don't need to see soft porn when we're watching a ""historical series"". this show is appaulling and utterly disgusting!I couldn't even get through half of the first episode and this is my reaction. YUK!"
5,Great guitar even better price,"I love guitar. It was shipped with care,an the action is great for model I chose.This is guitar for begginner or pro.You wont regret ordering this guitar."
4,Great Guitar for a Beginner,"I bought this guitar as a gift for my teenage daughter who is musically inclined and has an interest in learning the guitar. I am a fan of the Ovation lines so I thought this would be a good choice for her and the pricing is very good. I had my son check it out when it arrived and he put it through the test. It tuned easily and the electronics worked fine. The neck and body are sized perfectly for a smaller individual. The finish is nice. Don't expect the same quality finish that you get with the more expensive models, but it still looks great. Most of all it has a very nice mellow sound and it sounds even better when amplified. My daughter is very happy with it and has been playing with it every day. The first riff she learned was Day Tripper so that made me happy!"
5,Great CD,This CD is great!! The lyrics in every song are amazing. I have had this CD in my truck for 3 weeks now and I am still not sick of listening through the same CD over and over!
2,Bad Battery,"I ordered and recieved the battery quickly. However when I installed it in my flashlight and placed it on the charger, it would not take a charge. I tried several different charger and still the same problem with the battery stick. I returned the item and requested a refund."
2,Religion conlflict,"In my opinion the story is not realistic, because I have never heard that a young boy believes in God so strongly that he gets into trouble with his father or his parents."
3,The conflict between father and son,"I think that the story is a mixture of a lot of ideas and feelings and very difficult to explain or to interpret.The relationships between the characters are intricate.The conflict between father and son only exist, because none of them is able to talk about their ideas. Parvez, the father uses his son to brag and doesn't want to accept the right situation. The son, Ali, is religious and doesn't want to accept the life-style of his father.He wants to live like his ancestors in Pakistan, but when Parvez wants to talk, Ali isn't interested. Although they have a different behaviour, I think that their heart is the same."
4,Peligrosamente juntos all well but the place of delivery,"The item arrived in time and was in good condition. The only little complain is that, because it was a little big for the mail box, the postman was to leave it outside the mailbox. Fortunately I was at home when he rang. If I hadn't been, the risk of robery should have been important."
2,Definitely NOT as good as TurboTax Products,"You may pay a few more bucks for the TurboTax software, but you will certainly get your money's worth! TurboTax (by Intuit) is much better refined than TaxCut, and I believe that this is due to the fact that TurboTax has had much more experience in the tax software and personal finance business."
3,be careful,"Last year, I bought TaxCut (Deluxe) and fired a refund application for the State Tax software. I have never seen the refund back. I have never received anything from them. So try to get the refund first."
3,Realtree Camo Cover,"I have had this cover for 2 years. When I first received it, it looked great on my Dark Khaki Liberty. After a few months the color began to fade - now 2 years later the color has faded so bad you can barely see it. I would like to find a better quality/longer lasting item to purchase."
4,A contractors point of view.,This is a very complete compilation of cost data for commercial construction. The systems portion is very helpful for a quick estimation but the real value is in the wide variety of componets listed. This book will take awhile to learn to use for the new contractor but the investment in time is worth while.
1,Of questionable quality for educational use,I can't believe I watched the same program that others have said they used for classroom teaching. It was an extremely facile and unanalytical treatment of the subject.I would recommend that any showing of this film in a classroom be accompanied by a critique of the contextual assumptions implicit in this production.I am very glad that I previewed this before not buying it for my library.
4,Captivating,"I purchased this movie for a Spirituality in Art humanities class and I wish I had only heard of it sooner! Stunning images, nice selection of narrators, and none of those preachy annoying professors being interviewed. I hate that part of ""educational tv"" where the expert just shows off. None of that here. An excellent look at representations of the Savior through many cultures. A must have."
3,ok,Not as helpfull to me as Froders but that is only my overal impresson of ease of use and really good material. Since I had one year to plan this it was worth the additional time to read it also
2,Only one player at a time!,"This game does not support multi-player as suggested in the product description. Very disappointing as we have three children who would like to play the game together. The graphics are good and the story line is good, but if your sole intent is to purchase for more than one player, you will be very disappointed. Tech Support for Konami for PS2 is non-existent, so don't try to look for answers there. It's too bad we can't get our money back. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Not For Folks Who Work In Front Page Explorer,"This book deals with HTML coding. If you're like a lot of people who let an editor like FrontPage Explorer 98/2000 deal with the coding, it's very likley you've already done most of these tricks. I'm very disappointed in this book. I was expecting much more. Probably great if you are a codehead imersed in HTML and you're having problems... but the real world is now using HTML editors like FP, Hotdog etc etc."
3,Wedding in the Family,"In this sequel to Midge Bennett at Duncan Hall, Midge schemes to straighten out her cousin's romance and is rewarded by being chosen as her maid of honor.While not as immediately captivating as the earlier book, I enjoyed this novel for Midge's irrepressible sense of fun."
1,Rather curious because this book was pulped by court order,"Shortly after the original edition of this book came out a bunch of US Navy admirals sued Howling Mad for libel, won, and got a court order to have the remaining copies destroyed and all Howling Mad's royalities turned over to them. For the ""good"" of Navy/Marines/Army relations the court case was kept rather quiet. Guess this makes this book one of those ""banned"" books of high collectability. Anyone who reads this book must read Edmund Love's ""The 27th Infantry Division in WWII"" for balance."
3,"Worth listening to, but not one of their better efforts","I always look forward to Midnight Oil efforts. But this album was a dissapointment from previous recordings. I do enjoy the creativity and the attempt at deviating from the normal sound. Midnight Oil is still a creative band and for an Oil listener, this CD should be added to the collection for occasional alternative Oil listening."
5,"""The Mirror Has Two Faces"" is an absolute winner!!","This CD is such a winner!! I have played it several times while doing artwork and NEVER get tired of it. Of course, I loaded it along with several others on my CD changer, which means it doesn't play constantly, but each time it comes around I'm glad to hear it. Things just flow along while this music plays. I visualize the movie---which is one of my all-time favorites. It doesn't matter if the sound track is not EXACT; I visualize the scenes that go with the music and all is just fine."
1,Was Disappointed,Not what I thought I was getting for a movie soundtrack. Did not get the entire songs sung the original artists. Got only clips added to Barbara's stuff. I recommend not buying this item.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FURNITURE!!!!,"Do not buy this furniture. In July 2008 I bought a whole set, 5 armless chairs, 1 corner piece, 1 chaise and the ottoman. I spend a lot of money on it. This year when I put the furniture outside, after 2 days the cushions were moldy and dirty and it's virtually impossible to clean them. Also, just by touching it the fabric falls apart. I contacted amazon and they came back saying that the only solution for my problem was to buy new cushions. THE NEW CUSHIONS THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE WHOLE PIECE OF FURNITURE. I now am the proud owner of ripped and stained furniture."
1,Horrible Quality,I bought 6 of these chairs and they all arrived damaged. The wood was split where the 2 pieces were supposed to be attached. I have been a loyal amazon customer for years. This was and is my last purchase. What a waste of time. Should have just gone with a retail store in the first place. Amazon should not sell products that they do not know how to ship. There were no packing peanuts or bubble used to protect the product at all. I am very disappointed. Amazon Frustration Free Packing really means cheap packing materials with no protection!
1,Greatly Surprised (UPDATE),"We had been looking for a patio ""sectional"" and were on the verge of paying much, much more. When the furniture arrived (in its 70# boxes), there were a few dings in a couple of pieces. I wasn't excited about shipping back the heavy freight, so I took some pictures and called Amazon. We made a deal we could both live with. The new furniture looks WONDERFUL. I would have preferred more cushion color choices, but we Scotch Guarded the light color and we'll see how it goes. VERY, VERY happy.UPDATE: When the price went way down, we ordered 2 more pieces to make the ""sectional"" larger. These pieces again arrived with slight damage, but that was far from the worst thing. The pieces are actually completely different. They are not built nearly as sturdy, the legs are a 1/2"" shorter and smaller in diameter. The cushions are completely different. I am still happy with the old pieces, but the new ones are horrible!! I would not buy these pieces now if I were you!!!"
1,Wrong Book,They gave me a stolen library book from Durham North Carolina and it was the wrong First Do No Harm...
1,Totally defective,I should have read the more recent reviews first instead of just looking at the average. The battery came completely dead and does not charge. Total waste of time and money.
1,I should have read the reviews...,"I ordered this item a few days ago because it was the cheapest 360 batter I came across on amazon, however buyer Buyer Beware, there is a reason this battery was the cheapest and that is because it DID NOT WORK AT ALL!!! I tried the battery with multiple controllers and charges and every time I got the same result, a battery that would not charge. Waste of money don't bother ordering from this seller unless you want a nonworking battery."
4,Saves You Money But Also Like Playing Russian Roulette,These rechargeable batteries have saved me a great deal of money and I like that a lot. But the problem is also that when I bought three of them only two truly worked the third wouldn't hold a charge so I bought another one and the same problem happened after I bought the fifth one which finally worked I had enough batteries for my controllers. That is probably the only annoyance I have with these batteries is that about 45% seem to be defective an that they won't hold a charge for either very long or not at all. So to the viewers who are interested in purchasing this while it will save you a lot on the cost of buying new batteries be prepared to have one or two to be defective...
1,microsoft,"Made in china. However cost reflects american made. How do you spell greed. Might as well buy the cheap brand, as long as its not pink."
1,DOA!,"I purchased the blue battery pack, and like other late comers to this product, the battery will NOT hold a charge! I tossed it. If you can, buy locally. For a couple of dollars more, both Best Buy and Gamestop have great options that actually work."
5,Pink Rechargeable Battery Pack,"Great product. I had a hard time finding it in stores. Not many places were carrying many, if any, pink rechargeable batteries, and my girlfriend had to have the pink controller."
3,"Only the new black batteries are reliable, but maybe others deserve a try","Only the new black batteries are reliable, all others are a risk. They make new black ones that have a different sticker with a bar-code on it. If it's all white then its old, but if its a black and white sticker then it's new. I just bought a blue and it's old, but it works alright, it probably won't last that long, though. I also bought a white battery that was not working properly. The charger kit shows a red light when a battery needs charged and a green light when it's fully charged, but the white battery didn't show any light. So, if you don't care what color the battery is, then get only black, which matches with many other colors. I bought the black batteries on a different page because they were in the double pack. If you order different colors, consider ordering from Amazon and keep the packaging so you can take it back if it's defective or looses all its charge."
4,Good but not great,"this product is great for the first 7-8 months. after that, it's just ok for its use. what makes it great for the first 8 months is the battery life when fully charged. You can geta bout 15-17 hrs out of it. after 8 months, the battery life does not last that long anymore when fully charged. You get about 7-8 hrs out of it. If it's doesn't bother you to have to charge it every 7 hrs, then it's no big deal."
1,Crap,Absolute crap. It will not hold a charge. I didn't get to use it until a month after I bought it so I am out of luck. Waste of 7 bucks.
4,Balck & Blue are great Pink is DOA/crap.,Black and Blue packs are doing fine at 2 years but the pink one that I got was DOA like most of the other reviews of the pink ones.
2,Buyer Beware!,"Received two pink rechargeable batteries still sealed. But one of the batteries will not charge and does not work.Buyer Beware, I had bought these for my daughter, but if I have to rate the product, I would say that overall I am very dissastisfied with my order, and for the money that I spent on these, they should both work."
2,bad,it lasted only 20 minutes at a time it kept falling out of the controller and it took a whole month to get here
1,Did not hold charge,This thing did not hold charge or even charge for that matter. These things are old and expired. You can risk buying one to see if it works and then returning it if you want. I took a chance and it failed so I returned it.
1,FAULTY and LIED,Bought this battery and it was faulty wouldn't even charge. It's a joke that these are still sold on here seeing sooo many bad reviews.
1,Doesn't work,"I thought I was smarter than everyone else. I read one of the reviews that said if you attempt to recharge the battery multiple times, the battery will eventually begin recharging. I put this in my controller and tried to recharge it. Red light never went on. I pulled out the charging cord and put it back in. Nothing. I retried this 20 or 30 times and it never worked. These batteries are dead."
4,Extra juice for 360 Controller....,These battery packs are a must have for any 360 gamer. Don't let your controllers run out of steam in the middle of a game :).
2,"Possibly defective, but not their fault","The product arrived as described brand new in its packaging. However, We've noticed that the available play time for the battery is extremely short (sometimes only lasting for a few hours), especially when compared to our other rechargable battery. However, I think this is a case of a defective product manufactured by Microsoft rather than a problem from the seller. My experience with rechargable batteries in general has beena good one, but this specific item seems to have problems."
3,It works fine but why was the pink one the cheapest.,This pack works fine but I have to write more than that to even rate it so I'm babbling now. Why pink? Where are the blue ones?
1,rechargable battery pack,This company NEVER mailed my purchase n after many emails I chalked it up to a lesson learned I will Never use them again.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!,"I have had to return two of these batteries, both are dead, dead, dead. They will not hold a charge. Amazon says they will be looking into this problem as I was not to happy when I contacted customer service. Just don't waste your money, and more importantly your time. I thought this was a good deal. Turns out its not. Really, don't buy this."
3,Ordered Pink from Direct Distributor,I ordered two of the Pink batteries from Direct Distributor on 2/20/2011. One worked for about 5 minutes and doesn't seem to hold a charge. The other one preforms fine.
4,Spider Essays,"While I don't agree with Spider Robinson on most things political, I enjoy reading him because he never wastes my time. His writing is concise, his opinions clear, his energy evident."
3,Disappointing from a band with so much talent.,"I am a fanatical Toad fan, yet I still felt disappointed when I first heard this one. There are a few gems, but overall, not their best. I don't mind the experimentalism per se, but I wish it done with more emotion and feeling, as all their previous albums did."
4,"Toad Gives Us Their Last Album, A Great Piece of Work Indeed","Having long since been a toad fan (since ""All I Want"" first hit the radio), I enjoyed their music but did not purchase any till recently, picking up In Light Syrup and this, their very last (excepting P.S., of course). Moving, sweet, and sensitive, and even when Toad breaks from formula, it is interesting rather than a jarring misstep. And the heartbreakingly sweet ""Silo Lullaby"" [found as a .mov file on the CD or normally on P.S.] is the perfect goodbye for a band that deserves every bit of praise it gets. From ""Whatever I Fear"" to ""Dam Would Break"" to ""Little Man Big Man"" (the best 3) and many others, this is an album that yes, some minor flaws, but still, one to treasure."
5,Fascinating and insightful,"Very interesting look at these relationships and how they can go awry.The author does a good job ameliorating Jung's patriarchal bias as well, making his theories more useful."
4,"I wanted to love it! But ""like"" is all I could do...","Don't get me wrong, I'm not throwing the unused ones out. But I, like others, was looking for a cheap alternative to my Yankee Car Jars in ""leather"". The smell is not horrible; not by any stretch of the imagination. It's just not the same. They'll stay. I'll use them. I just won't by any more."
4,GREAT PRODUCT FOR A SUPER PRICE,This is a great mouse.I got tired of the ball mouse and its rollers geting dirty. It has far better acuracy and comfort.i highly recomend it to anyone tired of their old mouse. it is great.
5,excellent replacement mouse,"I bought this mouse to replace my wheelmouse, and was very pleased with it. The ""intellieye"" is fast, and precise. I would highly reccommnend this mouse over a wheelmouse."
2,Tax Cut Tax Preparation Software,I am so disappointed about not being able to prepare more than one state tax. I never used to have this issue with Tax Cut previously. Why should I have to pay for another state preparation? You never any say what additional cost is for any additional states.
1,not that great,"Maybe the movie got better during the last half...I turned it off. It was just a dreary, slow movie with no significant plot....just some drunk's dull life. The acting was superb, but every story needs a plot. Definitely not my cup of tea."
5,GOOD SUSPENSE,"I watched this movie on HBO a long time ago and I found the suspense to be intriging.The story involves a woman who is injured in a car crash and cannot remember who she is or where she lives. The only thing she does remember is witnessing a brutal murder, which the police cannot find any record of. The suspence escalates with a surprising ending.The main actors were good, including Bonnie Bedelia, Peter Riegert and Ricardo Darin. The only disappointing element in this movie was that Ricardo Darin only had a few scenes, when he is the best actor in the movie. Other than that, the movie was worthwhile.I hope this comes out on DVD in the near future."
1,Crap,This is a cheap piece of crap the is not as picture and dose not work. Don't waist your time or money.
5,great product and outstanding service,"hello,i needed an extension usb cord for my drawer hidden keyboard. amazon and cables to go provided an excellent cord that fit my needs. now the cord is hidden and the keyboard drawer pulls completely out without any binding. the desktop installation and set up was in progress and the next day the cable arrived to complete the set up. i have purchased many cables to go cables and they are great. comparison wise, it is delivered super fast and is less expensive than i could purchase locally. plus, i could get the exact length i needed.thanks..."
4,It Works,"It works. You need it if you don't want to plug your Flip camera directly into the computer - mine is a big MAC and it would have to stick out off the back and I would have to unplug all the other ports. Wish it were a tad longer so I could put the Flip on my desk, but it works fine and I just leave the camera on top of the computer."
1,These extension cables need to be better built,"they don't work or work for very short period of time, and then for some unknown reasons they stop working. It's a great idea but the construction of it leaves much to be desired. I hate through money away on junk like this no matter how little it was."
4,"Pretty good, but missing my favorite bad guy","I really do love this book. But when I first got it, I was a little dissapointed to find out that my favorite bad guy, Dingodile, is nowhere to be found in it. But then I figured that the reason for this may be that this book was probably manufactured before ""Crash Bandicoot Warped"" was released. So, in conclusion I think this book deserves a good rating."
4,"A guide to draw Crash, if you have basic drawing skills","Although this book doesnt teach you the essentials of drawing, my kids got lot of ideas on how to draw Crash which they also implemented on other characters."
3,Entertaining for the under 2nd grade crowd.,"A good CD for preschool to about 2nd grade, then they simply out grow it."
3,"Unique idea, light execution","2 1/2 starsFun, accessible electronic hybrid of tango and techno yields less then it's promise. This music can serve as some interesting background to any pseudo-cultured affair one would want to hold, although when brought under a microscope the tunes here sadly coast through like clockwork. Pity, seeing the huge promise this unique sound the band has crafted hardly begin to express it's inner logic, let us hope for some further articulated sound on future releases."
1,A great disappointment,"The Gotan Project were going to perform in Sydney, Australia in January. I had never heard of them, but loving tango music, I decided to buy this recording to test the music before booking for the live performance. And what did I hear? An unimaginative electronic rhythm beat, recorded too loud in comparison with the rest of the instruments, a colourless female singer, an outstanding bandeneon player (whom you could hardly hear over the electronic beat), works that have hardly any tunes - just a change in harmonies, with frequent overtones of other tango composers. Terrible! The only 'reasonable' piece was the last one by Piazzolla from the film 'Sur' - but the performance by the male singer on the 'Sur' CD puts this the dull female to shame. Needless to say, I did not book for the live performance, and gave the CD away to a person I do not particularly like."
2,I could not make myself sit through it,"Maybe it works as backround music, or a soundtrack, but to simply sit there, and take these songs for what they are just doesn't cut it. Can someone please tell me what is so incredible about sampled tango tunes over boring, programmed drum beats.If you're expecting something innovative or fresh, you'll be dissapointed with something that sounds as bleak and uninspried as this."
5,"Slinky, seductive and addictive - listen at your peril!","The name says it all - ""Gotan"" is a twist on ""tango"", the dance that's famed as ""the vertical expression of a horizontal desire. Gotan takes the distinctive sound of the Buenos Aires squeezebox or bandoneon, plus violin plus the basic ""slooow, sloooow, quick-quick sloooow"" pulse and the sultry attitude of the tango, overlays loping bass'n'drums'n'dub and filters the whole mix through a witty Parisian post-modern sensibility.It's slinky, seductive and very addictive.And provocative. The opening track ""Queremos paz"" (We want peace) samples Che Guevara's 1964 address to the UN General Assembly and ""El Capitalismo Foraneo"" (Foreign Capitalism) echoes with the ghostly presence of Evita Peron. There are cool reworks of Zappa's piece ""Chunga's Revenge"" and Gato Barbieri's theme for the movie ""Last Tango in Paris"".It's lounge, it's mellow, it's sexy and it has just the right edge of sweet Argentinean sadness."
5,up and coming,"Pilot Radio has the energy of the young, but the sound of experience and expertise. This band, local to Houston, is loaded with talented members, but still has the ability to play with a blended sound resulting in great vibes and rhythm. Pilot Radio is dually blessed with a great recorded and mixed sound as well as a vibrant and captivating stage presence. If you love music you can always listen to and you love to hear a band before they are huge get in right now because it won't be long until Pilot Radio is a household name. Grab a CD, grab a T-Shirt, and make sure to catch a show. Best of luck to Pilot Radio."
5,Powerfull songs,"Very diverse CD-Best song would be This Island Earth- it rings very true to mankinds issue of destroying this planet & will we ever learn-very well written & performed.Very diverse songs like Just Breathe, I am not hiding & No Doubt About Love"
4,A classic book on financial econometrics,"This is really a classic book on financial econometrics. I like the design of the book. The content is also pretty up-to-date. A little bit advanced - requires solid background in econometrics, analysis, statistics, and some stochastic calculus. The only problem I have is the authors did not provide background data, so it's really hard for people to do self-study like me. If the authors could include a preferred computer program (i.e. Matlab, GAUSS, EViews, etc.) with codes and data, that will make the book a true bible of financial econometrics."
4,An oldie but goodie,"For the past ten years, this boook was the standard of financial time series and cross sectional analysis. There are several more recent books on the subject, but as the first good book in the field, it is still keeping up. Lot of the derivation in the book is a bit spotty - but that is expected at this level of sophistication and originality. There are some frustrating parts in the book, but if you cannot chew through that material, you should probably read an easier book."
5,One of my favorites,This album has and will always be in my top 10 of all time. I have other albums of Gato but love this album; each and every song! I've read some of the other reviews that say it was bland at best. WHAT? I have Tropica. I have Caliente and they are also his best. But give him credit where it was due! Come on Gato we are ready for another!
5,A Classic-Loved by my 15 yr old!,"Have owned this CD for a number of years... it's my 15 yr old son's favorite CD--he added it to his Ipod this Christmas. Gato is classic, latin jazz with style, class and flair unsurpassed by any others. This CD is among his best (if not his VERY best), and is enjoyed often in my home. Listen to track one for a truly memorable experience! Que Pasa!"
4,be aware bottle does not come with 328984,The picture is misleading. 328984 doe not come with a bottle. P-328985 does come with the bottle. The unit itself is all of what they say it is. My biggest complaint about amazon is that they do not provide enough detailed information about products or mandate that the sellers give more specifics so the customer can make better decisions on factual information rather than assumptions based upon pictures. I still feel like a received a good deal and a great product. I just need to order the bottle now.
5,Soft and so cute,"This is the most wonderful product! The lamb face is darling, and the softness of the toy makes it perfect for a newborn."
1,Worst $50 I have ever spent,I bought this product to surprise my kids. I am lucky I tried it out before they came home. The cylinder would ice up and not spin. That would cause the teeth of the gears to strip. It never worked ONCE! The only bright side is I can take it back before my kids find out I bought it.
1,Muy Mala calidad,"La compre para usarla con mis amigos en las reuniones, pero cuando la iva ausar, el cilindro nunca giro, me la vendieron mala. y las piezas de adentro son de muy mala calidadsalu2"
5,Great for casual travel use,"This is a small compass that very easily fits into small pockets or can hang on your key chain without being a nuisance. We used this to help us navigate around large unfamiliar cities in Japan where most directions were given by NSEW rather than left or right. It never let us down and the glow - while not extraordinarily bright, was useful at night."
4,Excellent low-budget drama,"This is sci-fi, but don't expect a high tech thriller -- it's a well-written, well-acted, well-directed drama. The pace is on the slow side, but if you're in a laid-back mood, it's a nice little movie to kill an hour and a half with."
1,Does not harden,"Bought this product at Home Depot and used it in my bathroom. It never hardened! I didn't think to check the date when I bought it, looked at the expiration date and it's 03/08! Can't believe Home Depot would sell caulk that's 4 years out of date AND judging from what I've seen online it's a KNOWN defective product."
3,"As a business book, not my cup of tea","I read this book based on a recommendation from Forbes magazine in an article named ""books to get rich by"".. well, this one is quite a reach to have on that list. Now, if you are a fan of UCLA basketball, Mr. John Wooden himself, or 60's college basketball, you will love it. I am a not a fan nor a hater, but I was trying to get some value out of it for business purposes. I didn't get much."
5,Success built on the pyramid,"We all know about Wooden's success. However, I was surprised how he built that success. He did so by modifying Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to the athlete. Really enlightening. If you're a coach, this is a must read."
5,Awesome,"I first saw this band at a benefit concert and they were great so, I had to get a CD, plus the money went to help a kid out with cancer and help him get better... I love this CD... The words are great and they have some funny inserts in it... I may have to get a new one soon... noticed theres a huge scratch in mine... Definatly worth it :-D"
4,"Hey, Idiot is funny and light reading!",I found this book both funny and light reading. It was perfect for the time when you don't want to get into a novel or don't have the time. Some of the people do the darndest things. Makes you wonder how the human race ever got this far. I recommend it as long as you don't take humanity too seriously.
3,Some sweet pop for you,"There is an obvious reason this Boston band was named after the infamous candy. Just like the candy-coated ball of glucose, the Lemonheads' brand of jangly guitars and hook-filled melodies ia also disgustingly sweet and irresistable. COME ON FEEL THE LEMONHEADS is loose, happy and completely harmless. ""Into Your Arms"" is guaranteed to put a smile on your face. ""The Great Big No"" is another song that'll stick with you. It's also one of the lesser in supply amplified numbers, as the bulk of the album maintains a rootsy, acoustic flair, or lack of flair for that matter. Sweet thing Juliana Hatfield lends her angelic pipes to parts of seven songs. And the late great super freak Rick James makes a surprising appearance on ""Rick James Style."" Smile on."
3,Bittersweet,"This is a good effort,and deserves 3 and a half.I have always loved this album even though it is average. It's About Time and Into Your Arms are great songs that never fail to make me smile.They are a feel-good band and are easy to listen to,but I found a track or two kinda irritating after a while. Also,some songs could have been really good,but were poor attempts as they were not structured as well as they could have been.I still think they are worth a listen, so make it animpulse buy.kadu81@hotmail.com"
4,"Joseph K. says., ""Like a dog.""","Wow! I am still puzzling over what the hell I just read. I am not sure that I understand all of the symbolism just yet, but I do feel much for the central character. Overall the feeling that humanity is somewhat displaced in the world today seems to be the motif."
5,The greatest book I have ever read.,"When I finished reading the last word of ""The Trial"" I was amazed. This is the mose briliant book I have ever read in my life. Kafka words are so powerfull and the story is very deep, disturbing and clever. It gives people a all new prespactive to look at life."
5,Worth it to push through.,"I read The Trial last year and followed it up with The Castle. I must say, Kafka must have been one of the most brilliantly messed up writers Earth has ever seen. His works leave your mind reeling under the social implications and truth of the world around us. Though I had to push myself to finish this book (as happens with all depressing books I read), I enjoyed it immensely. (Just for the record, I am now a junior in high school.)"
4,A chilling reflection on the modern bureaucratic state.,"Kafka's work stands as the best literary expression of one of the key pathologies of the bureaucratic form of organization: the marginalization of basic civil liberties and the denial of individual dignity. Prophetically, Kafka relates the inaccessibility of the judicial apparatus to the lay public. Relatedly, THE TRIAL is perhaps most valuable for what it does not afford the reader - a precise understanding of the circumstances facing Joseph K. In short, the reader's exprience with THE TRIAL mirrors that of its main character. Kafka never fully reveals his purpose, offers only glimpses into the structure of his own thought, and torments the reader with details that are at once compelling yet excruciatingly tangential to reader's principal concern: ascertaining the exact nature of Joseph K.'s predicament. The result is a novel that speaks to our most personal fears and asks us to reconsider the purposes of civil government."
5,What have I done?,"If any of you have ever screamed to the high heavens ""Lord, can you just give me an answer?!"" then you shall find a sympathetic friend in Kafka's Joseph K. The writing is beautifully simplistic, making for an altogether smooth read despite the dreary existential content, but what would you expect from a man who wanted all of his manuscripts burned after death? What is driving us on our futile search for truth? Is this truth even worthwhile? And what is it to live life without a sense of truth that is true for you? When reading, I found Kafka trying to explain these questions to himself with every written word. I'd only recommend this book to those brave, truth seeking souls, so for all you others, leave the spirit of Kafka in peace, because lord knows he had it hard enough in this life."
1,can someone tell me what this is REALLY about?,"I dont want to sound clueless, but, what trial? so, he was trapped as an accused man and had three choices of being acquitted and chose none, so he goes with the flow to die. So what then...? Why do we all have to be so analytical about this? What is the point?"
2,Life is too short to finish this book.,This incomplete book is boring and makes no sense. There's actually a chapter missing. I would not recommend to anyone.
4,"Fantastic book, but not the best translation","This is possibly one of the most important works of the 20th century; however, many translations do not do it justice. In attempting to correct Kafka's occasional use of unorthodox grammar, I believe translations rob the reader of elements that add to the book. Also, the important opening line of the book (just to point out one of a number of examples) loses its original meaning through the constant misinterpretation and subsequent translation. I recommend Breon Mitchell's translation--it is the best I have read and it truly does justice to the original work of Kafka."
2,What's the big Deal???,I didn't enjoy this book at all. My friends told me that I had to read this book. I found the book very boring. Kafka may be famous for his style but I think he was a terrible writer. The book had a good plot but he never got to the point. He kept on beating around the bush.
3,"Depressing at times, but not bad..","Kafka is a good writer, I have no doubt about that, but he is far too pessimist at times. What's more is he feels he had to reflect his pessimism on his works every time, he likes to confuse his readers. In literary terms it's a good book, but I can't say I was so eager to finish it after reading the first half of it. I've read a lot of books that were based on the same formula and they were better, but on the other hand I've also read ones that were much worse."
3,"A nightmarish, emaciated vision of industrial society.","This is unquestionably a powerful, enigmatical modern, and even postmodern text, with its sordid portrayal of an urbanized universe. It is also a classic essay on the folly of existence. - ""Like a dog!"" - For what crime is K. on trial? How can he redeem himself? And who is the face at the window, glimpsed towards the end...? - There are no answers, no causes; life is a glaring, unfathomable absurdity. All are constrained by the necessity of obeying the inscrutable ""law"" that controls all and has everything in its thrall. Kafka's writing is superb, with acute powers of suggestion. His work, which has been very much overrated,in my view, is a brilliant but unpardonably clever description of the pressures and anxieties of modern industrial life."
1,Horrid translation.,"Genius author and great writing however this translation - forget about it. This translation sucks big time. As an avid reader and having read many masterpieces in translation this is by far poorest. Don't waste your money. I usually pay close attention to who is translating, for whatever reason i let my guard down this time and now stuck with this edition - useful only for collage purposes."
3,My Introduction to Kafka,"I liked the Trial. In my quest to read the top 100 fiction books of the last century, I picked up what is probably Kafka's seminal work. (this was listed at number 92) I found this book to be a somewhat poignant discussion of how our society judges people, how perception is reality, and how in life, you rarely get a fair trial. I also saw Kafka's work as unique and unlike any of the other books I've read on the top 100 list. Kafka's style is straight-forward and concise and his sentences are packed with meaning. There really isn't a lot of superfluous verbiage or flowery, overly-descriptive prose. As with most of the classics, this book is worthwhile if you're looking to get something out of it beyond the storyline."
1,This is GARBAGE!,"This is not Yes! This is a bunch of people making a hoorible attemp to make music in the 80's with out getting thrown into a dark alley way and getting shot. Bring back the good stuff! Relayer,Tales from a Topographic Ocean, Close to the edge, and Fragile. I was listening to rhythm of love and i nearly threw up.Even 90125 isn't that sickening.If you like this then you should go fornicate with Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash.Seriously if you see this album in stores light it on fire and complain to the store owners you have feces in the store for music."
3,YES - well kinda',"I've been a fan since Fragile was released-so these 80's albums have been a tad difficult for me-this is no exception. This is not a bad album-I just did not find it interesting. I did not compare it to the classics-but I exspected it to hold up to 90125. It did not, for me at least. I gave it 3 stars and that is being very kind."
5,Rabin's Second Yes Project Is A Winner,"BIG GENERATOR, Trevor Rabin's second studio release with Yes, is great. Most of the songs are excellent, with particular standouts being ""Rhythm Of Love"" (which features some Beach Boys-style vocal harmonies), ""Shoot High Aim Low"", ""Almost Like Love"", ""Love Will Find A Way"", and ""Final Eyes."" The fact that several members of the band, past and present, are advocating international sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist is yet another reason not to pass up this album by a band of great musicians who are also great people."
3,Good,"Steely Dan may have liked this, because they later chose Jimmie Haskell to do their arrangements. Haskell had worked at ABC with people like Tommy Roe.The above review goes into the concept of this album, a early 70s-filtered version of what Calli would be like in 1999. Ridiculous. THe music is ok, some of Haskell's own work and songs by conteporaries like Curt Boucher, tracks fromBegin.This all sounds a lot more interesting than it is. Not bad but nothing remarkable."
4,Garden Design 101,"This is a great intro to garden design drafting. It covers at a high-level how to draw a garden design and some basic principles of structure. If you are wanting to learn how to draw designs for your garden, this is a good place to start. If you have experience in garden design, another book may be a better choice."
5,Great book for beginning designers,"This was the very first book I bought when I became interested in doing Landscape Design. It is very easy to follow, lots of photos, overlays, color, exacting instructions, highly recommend it. I am now a professional landscape designer, took college courses for two years, but I really think this was a very good place for me to start."
2,Disappointing,I am actually kind of disappointed in this amplifier. I was hoping for huge improvements in my reception. It helps just a little bit. There is a little bit less fuzz and slightly improved sound quality but the improvements are modest at best.
2,Leaves too many steps out,"I agrees with other reviewers. Be very afraid if your prof uses this book for advanced transport. This is the most difficult Chem E book I've ever suffered through. It leaves gaps in the solutions, and the hw problems are extraordinarily difficult. I hope some professor who is a good teacher answers this book and writes one that students will understand. Take a look at some of the Texts to come out of the University of Michigan (I didn't go there, but have found they are very useful well-written references), maybe one of those profs will write one."
3,Expected better,Purchased for survival kit but have second thoughts as will not light in any kind of wind. Flame control will not work at all. I had read the compass on bottom should not be relied on and thats no kidding. One minute points north then south then wherever. Basically an expensive indoor cigarette lighter.
2,Not Required,"The original score to Major Dundee was very good. I do not see where it was necessary for Christopher Caliendo to compose a new score for the restoration. The original score was innovative, brooding and ultimately rousing. Those three elements were indicative of the director's intentions."
2,Weak,Christopher Caliendo's score is very weak. Why he was chosen or why the original score was replaced is a mystery. This score is perfunctory at best. It does not work in this film at all.
2,Misleading Title,DBZ is a great card game to play. It is discontinued now and hard to find. But if you are looking for a great trading card game to play I suggest this one.Now onto the review of this product. The World Game series is probably my least favorite booster series but all in all it could have been worse. This product though is miss leading because you only get one starter set not two. The card game is tough to start fyi also.
3,"Edison Force, don't shoot the movie, just the writer","Okay for the 100th time we see a movie about a corrupt police force. In this particular case you couldn't get much closer to ""Magnum Force"" or ""Serpico"" if you tried. I suppose the younger crowd may see a little ""Assault on Precinct 13"", the remake, in this movie. Now given the acting talent and not to bad a presentation I still say this is worth at least a rental. I understand them reworking material for the kids who haven't watched all the previous versions of police corruption, that will make kids think, hey Justin Timberlake investigating corruption, cool, or whatever the word for that is these days. Great performances by Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. This however is not to say law enforcement officers will wonder is it really necessary to beat this nag (old horse) to death again. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""Minority Report"" and ""Mind Hunters"". Decent quality DVD with some replayability."
1,dont waste your time,"Sad, sad, sad. Cliche, cliche, cliche.The real question with this waste of film is what the f... A list talent such as Morgan Freeman + Kevin Spacey are doing in this rubbish!"
1,Violence...,not even at its best! The movie just never got past the killing. There is no story just killing and corruption. An all-star class of actors but nothing for them to perform. Too bad....
2,comparing timberlake as Batman? are u crazy?,"Trini's review was laughable at best,especially when exagerating comments like ""edison force are superheroes"" sounds like a review to gather one's attention especially the comic-to-movie enthusiasts. The only saving grace in this film would be Freeman and Spacey (Whom both starred in recent superhero film respectivly;Batman begins and superman returns.) I guess they need a little extra cash to pay for their boats,cars etc.Justin Timberlake was always a hack performer,ergo his acting credibility is no surprise. LL is another reason why rappers,pop stars should not become actors..it's not branching out..more like selling out. the movie is too slow paced for my tastes and the title Edison Force, is a marketing ploy to attract action movie buffs. (It was originally titled Edison)I would recommend The Star chamber and even vigilante force over this turd. Thank You."
2,Really Bad,"This movie is not bad because of Justin Timberlake. It's amazing how hard ppl are being on Justin, if anything it's the vetern actors that should be critized not a new comer like Justin. The script is almost appealing but for some reason it doesn't translate well to the screen. I think Justin did a great job for his first venture into acting. Rent this don't buy it."
5,Excellent contemporary novel,"As a somewhat choosy reader, I often find myself turning to ""the old stuff"" in lieu of today's bland pulp fiction, but this novel by Eugenides is truly excellent. The plot, which runs from the early 20th century life of the main character's grandparents to his current romantic/interpersonal debacle, is captivating all the way through. Eugenides provides the reader with an intensely personal view of the main characters; he has lushly fleshed them out so much so that they shine even brighter than the story itself in places. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to others out there who think that the art of the novel is a dying breed."
4,Great literature...about Detroit!,"In addition to what many, many others have written, I would recommend this book not only because it is an exceptional novel about immigration, adolescence, societal transformation, and medical anomoly--but also because it is also the only novel I have ever read that has treated the city of Detroit with real interest, knowledge, and affection.Having grown up in a Detroit suburb and now living far away, this book has awakened a recognition of where I am from. This book is about working-class immigrants and their children and grandchildren. It feels wonderfully familiar.I listened to the unabridged audiobook version read very well by Kristoffer Tabori. He does an excellent job, although he does mispronounce Gratiot. :)I highly recommend this book, especially for those who have a connection to Detroit."
2,Pulitzer Prize for this????,"It's too long and I found many parts irrelevant to the theme. I frequently said to myself, ""get on with it."" I read it because I received it as a gift. I was glad when I finally finished it and can now read something more enjoyable. Desdamona was totally ignored for much of the last part of the book. It was like the author didn't know what to do with her -so she was simply was put aside - put to bed for 5 years.. How ridiculous. Who chooses these Pulitzer Prize winners?"
5,Middlesex,This was an insightful book. I recommend it for those who have or know a child that needs to accept themselves for who and what they are.
2,Nothing Special,"I don't know, but to me this book was...bland. The beginning was slow and didn't really delve into feelings, I would of loved to learn more about the love between Desdemona and Lefty- once they were married the love affair drizzled out. And if the subject of Callie finding herself and falling in love with The Object could of moved on, gone deeper. Instead it was like some called WRAP and they just quickly tied up all the ends very quickly with grandeous happenings- like the car chase and club sixtyniners. The subject was very interesting but some of the turns the book took were unrealistic. It was just plainly nothing special!"
1,Why won't this book go away?,"I can't believe this book is a book club selection for my library. It's a long boring rambling ridiculous story that I attemped to read 2 years ago and could not even finish. Why does it still keep popping up?? I think its fame alone is keeping it famous, though its actual content is not worthy. I guess it has become a fashion item, with the momentum of any arbitrary, mindless fashion trend. Let's break this trend and stop making our kids read this thing! There are better books to read."
3,What is this book about?,"Is it about a hermaphrodite? Or is it about the successive offspring of an incestuous relationship? If the former, then stick to the former. Is Eugenides (is that name coincidence?) telling us about a mutation of nature and its bearer? Or is he intimating that the mutation was the result of the incestuous union? The seeming relationship between the two is disturbing to me: Stuff just happens? Or your grandparents' (mis)deeds come back to bite you in the crocus? While the story was engaging, I found this intimated link distracting."
4,Wow!,What an interesting book - it really makes you think about the genetic impact of a small and isolated community. The author does a wonderful job of making you understand and feel the main character's life story.
4,Great story!,"Middlesex is an engaging story told by Calliope Stephanides, a third generation Greek-American. Calliope's story begins long before her birth, in a small town in Turkey. Our omniscient narrator tells her story and that of her family in such an engaging way, I found it incredibly difficult to stay away from Middlesex for long. It was a truly enjoyable read, filled with excellent narration and memorable characters.Many might be turned off by the subject matter, particularly the incest and the fact that the story is about a hermaphrodite. Don't be. These are just elements of the bigger picture, which is a fantastically written story."
5,A delightful surprise,"An engrossing story of three generations of a Greek and Greek-American family, molded by historical events, personal tragedies and genetic destiny. It's a family saga, and yet it isn't, because it's more a coming of age story, and yet it isn't, because it's a sexual awakening drama, and yet it isn't, because it's really just about life and death and humanity--and only incidentally about the ""middle sex"" of the title because, as the protagonist/narrator tells us, ""it's amazing what you can get used to."" and the ""change from girl to boy was far less dramatic than the distance anybody travels from infancy to adulthood."" Readers expecting a salacious look at the life of a ""hermaphrodite"" have been disappointed in this book. They should have been delightfully surprised at getting so much more."
3,"Original, well written, but too artsy","Middlesex is one of those books that literary critics rave about, but that falls short for the less artistic of us. Don't get me wrong: the topic was unique--sensitive, but well handled--the writing was lyrical, and the story was ""sweeping."" All the same, I was bored throughout. I thought the topic was interesting, but I couldn't relate. I thought the writing style beautiful, but distracting in its superfluous artsiness. I thought the plot had some interesting coincidences that made nice little ah-ha! ha-ha! moments, but I remained distant from the main character throughout. It seemed like he was TRYING to stay distant, perhaps. TRYING to hold himself away at arm's length as something to study but not to love. Perhaps that was the point. Perhaps he wanted to keep himself a little distant because that was part of his personality. If so, I'm not artsy enough to appreciate the characterization device."
3,DIsappointing,"I purchased the book because of the Big O stamp of approval and found myself struggling to get through it.The history was somewhat interesting but the characters never seemed real to me, or maybe not compelling. I left it at the vacation rental, maybe someone else will enjoy it but I wont takes Oprah's recommendations so seriously now."
2,Where to start.,"I was very excited about this book. I'll start out by saying that when the author responded to a question on Oprah about ""having trouble"" writing the book (it took nine years); I can tell.First off, I found an error that should have been found in editing. Remember the Sixty-niners poster? Before and after that poster graphic. A line is repeated. Careless.Not mentioning Cal's grandmother in the last half of the book and then explaining in a quick excuse...sloppy.I loved the first half of the book. Laughed out loud in some parts; but the second half seemed rushed.Loved the Detroit history, but thought Cal's little ""tour"" in his brother's car after coming home was cheezy and merely filler.That's the ticket. The second half didn't resemble literature to me...it just seemed like page filler. The main characters lost their character that they were so richly developed in the first half.Can't recommend it and can't believe the attention."
2,Torturous read,"I love to read but found this book difficult to finish. If it wasn't for my book club, I would have given up on it. The author goes off on so many tangents that it is annoyingly frustrating. The first 200 pages could have been left out completely. The real crux of the story is buried in inconsequential details, infuriating details, unending details. The author really should have written several books instead of overloading this one with too much history. And he left out the stuff I really wanted to know, how did Cal live his life after finding out about himself? When it really started getting good, the book ended. I am surprised at how many stars this book got, very misleading."
3,"Well Written, But","Eugenides writes with a clear, constant voice, but this time what he had to say went in one ear and out the other. I truly enjoyed the style with which this book was written, but never came to care about the characters. I'd read for a bit, put it down and read The Road, go back to Middlesex, put it down, read A Prayer For the Dying. Finally,I put it down for the last time 3/4 of the way through. I've never given up on a book that close to the end, but I just couldn't do it."
2,Too much with too little.,"Eugenides attempts to make too much of too little plot and he shrouds this shortcoming in lengthy (and sometimes impressive) research ability. The Desdemona/Lefty backstory, while interesting, is not at all important to the purpose or direction of the novel and this reader feels as if the entire opening 200 pages could have been dropped to make this a much better read. As much as Euginedes feels like he needs to write a very lengthy, epic novel, he does not succeed but for the fact that he won a pulitzer as a result of such a poor year for fiction. The book is not terrible on the whole but it is not entirely engaging as popular belief would suggest."
2,Disjointed,"I had great expectations for this novel after reading such glowing reviews but it was a disappointing read for me. Being of Greek heritage, I did enjoy some of the historical references, but for the most part, I thought it was wordy and disconnected. The characters appeared, disappeared, reappeared - hard to follow at times. Sorry Mr. Eugenides, I really wanted to like your book."
5,middlesex,I absolutely loved this book. The story of three generations of a Greek/American family is so original and moving. I couldn't put it down.
5,More than a novel,"Middlesex is a tour de force. The author whisks us back and forth from the Turkish invasion of Smyrna, the fleeing to America of the protagonist's Greek grandparents, the Detroit of Henry Ford, plus the hero-heroines uncertain destiny which is controlled by the glitch on a chromosone producing a pseudo-hermaphrodite state. The reader bounces through time, through the tangles of grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, and a sister who turns out to be a brother. The narration is engaging, humorous, detailed, sometimes sad, but always tracking back to essentials, giving at the end an almost hopeful conclusion. Go read it. [note: you have wrong e-mail for me--I am jscreighton@yahoo.com - please fix]"
1,does not,"Middlesex is a book full of complex characters. the shift of the novel from the present to the past is very good. however, the novel does not offer satisfactory reading. the concept of the novel is very good but does not offer the reader any scope to think aobut how calliope feels. the book does not have any underlining moral. the book is just an entertainer, which does not even entertain. in such a situation, it would be ideal to think aobut how the society treats calliope as a girl and later as a boy. however, euginides does not tell the reader anything aobut that. it does not even seem that the book has any point to make. overall, if you have seriously nothing better to do, you might want to read this book. but if you are looking for a sample of some good literature, please do not read this book, for your own sake."
1,Complete disappointment.,"I am shocked by the positive reviews this book has gotten. To be honest, this is one of only 3 books that I have not been able to finish. I guess all I can say is that I thought the book was extremely boring and did not catch my attention. I honestly couldn't get past the 2nd chapter."
4,Fascinating. Epic. Mythic. Historic. Ethnic. Modern.,"It's epic like a Greek play-Middlesex spans 3 generations of Stephanides beginning in Asia minor and ending in Detroit.It's mythic like a tale of the gods-Caliope's story-her transition from Caliope to Cal-is what legends are made of.It's historic-well researched and almost ethnographic in its account of early-mid 20th century Detroit and Henry Ford's automobile factory.And yet all of this with a modern twist. The story is about Caliope's genes-waiting to express themselves in Caliope the hermaprodite-the eventual result of incest.The story opens strongly-with Desdemona and Lefty-Caliope's grandparents-in the midst of warfare in Smyrna and a budding incestous love affair which haunts Desdemona until the day she dies.I read eagerly along with Desdemona and Lefty's story-but eventually they grow old the story's focus switches to their child Milton and his wife Tessie. The story lags here, but keep trucking-it's worth it."
2,Stuck in the middle of MiddleSex,"Eugenides Pulitzer winning novel about a hermaphrodite (supposedly) is quite an ambitious story, but I'm thinking it's really a turn-on for those with more salacious apatites. Once I get over the literary trick that allows for the central character who's also omniscient, the only thing he seems to settle on is the variety of ancestors and their dysfunctional sexual relationships. Of course, there's also the occasional historical character who's thrown into the story for some kind of Forrest Gump effect.The writing is excellent, and the story may yet end up being wonderful. But I'm halfway through and I could care less about how the poor hermaphrodite will eventually tell his latest girlfriend about his mixed up genitalia. I wish you better luck than I."
3,Worth Reading but a bit long winded... be prepared,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I DO recommend this book and wouldn't change much about it - but blame the editor for not doing a better job.The author jumps from decade to decade, event to event, to the point of distraction at times. He also belabors every minor detail which is occasionally boring (as are most long winded people.) However, Mr. Eugenides tells an interesting story, worth having to occasionally speed read over some LONG passages detail on his side trips."
4,Who thinks this stuff up?,"I'm fascinated by novels like Middlesex. How does an author come up with a storyline like this, described so adeptly by previous reviewers? Just finished this with my book group--it was universely enjoyed, but each of us had a difficult time describing it to a couple of the group members who had not read it. Yes, it's the story of Calliope the hermaphrodite, but there is so much more to consider. Eugenides throws in European history, growing up in the 60's, race riots, sleazy sex clubs, etc, yet seems to get them all to coexist under one roof. In fact, we agreed that art imitates life here--the story wanders from one subject to another, much like a conversation among several people, but always finds its way back to its central issue after short (and interesting)detours. Nice work! And I too would like to know how Chapter Eleven was named--did I miss something?"
4,Freaky,"A bit over the top at times, some of the plot twists challenged my ability to suspend disbelief. Still a great read."
5,Clearly worthy of the Pulitzer,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. It is not a light read for the beach because you will relish every word.If you enjoy history you will like this book. If you enjoy female coming of age stories, you will like this book. If you enjoy well written prose you will enjoy this book. I could go on. As you can see from all of the reviews, it appeals to so many types of readers. I could not put it down.Thank you Jeffery Eugenides for sharing this story."
1,Could not even finish it.,"Awfully, boring. Monotonous, monotone dialog.Stopped halfway thru and trashed it.Don't waste your $$$$"
2,Just Okay,"I enjoyed the book, but I felt it dragged along quite a bit with a bit of an unsatisfactory ending."
3,Interesting,"The author's writing style is entertaining and attention getting. However, the book does have flaws from a disturbing incestuous relationship and then suddenly in the middle of the book one of the main characters disappears from the pages and then suddenly appears at the end of the book. It is a good book, but I don't see what all the fuss is about."
4,Better Than Expected,"The book arrive much more quickly than I expected. It is an old book, but was in good condition. I am completely satisfed. It is a verified Amazon.com purchase."
5,reflections on the rez,"i spent two weeks on the six nations rez that brian maracle centers his book on. maracle recounts his experiences upon returning to the rez, which include fixing his home (check out the chapter with the broken water pump!), and of course encountering rez bureaucracy.maracle explores the problems that face his community but does not accept a defeatist attitude, rather he adopts a humorous perspective.this was a great read. thanks to my dear friend nonwasichu for lending me the book, for your hospitality, and for the icecream."
3,Not Your First Book on Computer Programming,"Let me emphasize that this is not a book for people with no prior programming experience. Familiarity with basic object oriented programming conventions is assumed by the author. If you do not have the requisite background (proabably C++) the ""labs"" are confusing and hard to follow. If you've programmed before, but are new to Java, this is probably a good book with which to start, especially if you're working in the MS Visual Studio environment."
2,Eurocentric focus,This book had lots of creative ideas but I was appalled that the authors were so Eurocentric in the people and places represented in their activities. They need to revise their content to reflect more contributions and content from other continents. This book has a definite White-European bias and I would not recommend it for this reason.
5,The Lord's Prayer by Romano Guardini,"Romano Guardini, the noted theologian most famous for his book entitled ""The Lord"", here meditates on the words and meaning found in the Lord's prayer. I've found numerous new and gainful insights and now pray the Lord's prayer on a deeper and more substantial level.Sincerely, Frank Donahue"
3,I had high hopes...,"The problem I see with this device, besides having an extremely wanting instruction manual, is that the network features (as in network drive) only seem to work if your firewall is OFF. What good is that? So I can't access my drive from my wireless laptop unless I shut down the firewall. And even then, I have to re-configure each time I fire-up my laptop. A real pain. It seems like a software/setting problem that could be fixed, but there is not enough meat in manual to figure it out.Also, the UBS ports don't work.If I had an extra day in my life I might call tech support, but until then I just use the drive from my desktop and I'm living with it."
3,Britain's Automotive History,"This book is basically an encyclopedia of automobiles that were produced and sold in Great Britain during the 1920's. One chapter deals with American-made autos that were imported and sold in Britain. Each entry consists of a good quality photograph and a bare bones description of the car-- to include number of cylinders, horsepower, and engine displacement."
2,too hard to read,"This is hard too read. The font is small and it makes me dizzy to even try using it, which I never do."
3,No shrimp,"Not bad. Unlike the ingredients list advertised on Amazon, there are no shrimp in the mix. I think that's a big part of the flavor, and was kind of bummed out when I discovered it."
3,Black Jewel decline,"I have loved Black Jewel for several years now and have introduce many friends to it, who now love it too. Or used to. With the last case we bought online, that has now changed. I read a review at that time that said they had changed their bags and that it had affected how their corn is now popping. That customer was right. I now get a little over half per bag of what I used to get. The taste is the same but the amount that pops is woefully deficient. I've tried different microwave settings and still get the same results. What a shame! I suppose we'll continue our lifelong search for a great popcorn brand. Nothing else came close to Black Jewel but the value is now gone."
2,Little to offer except style,"This is a visually interesting movie, as far as the sets and use of color. However, nothing else about it is very good. If you want more out of a movie than that, I'd skip this.The plot (once you figure it out, which is entirely possible on the first viewing if you pay a little bit of attention and are at all familiar with science fiction cliches) is pretty much a huge cliche. The way the story is told is ok, but if you are familiar with the concept of ""flashbacks,"" it's not terribly impressive. There is almost no dialog. The acting is not great (impressive considering the actors have almost nothing to do acting-wise). The actual filming of it varies from interesting to annoying (think Blair Witch Project), with emphasis on the annoying (lots of badly shot action, blank screens, slightly nauseating shaky cam). The symbolism is trite.MILD SPOILER: Just to let you know the level of cliche in this movie, the final shot is of a single tear running down a man's face."
1,Impossible to Watch,"I kept skipping forward to see if they ever stopped rocking the camera in a way that makes you feel sea sick, and they didn't. The flashing light thing at the beginning, I have to assume is another way to make you feel sick. I would suggest to anyone who wants to go ahead and try to watch it, skip the entire first hour."
1,tedious,"When I sit down to watch a movie, I generally want a good story supported by acting, cinematography, A/V effects, and music, told at a decent pace. Based on the first 10 minutes, (which is all I could stand to sit through) Eden Log is a miss on all these criteria. No character development, un-inspired sound, and under-lit visuals. Don't waste your time."
4,Enjoyable Sci-Fi flick,"This is a must see for any sci-fi fans as I recommend. It is dark, a bit different, original, edgy, and leaves you wondering at the end. It takes a open-mind to understand what is going on and to enjoy this movie."
3,Good Not Great,"Robben is obviously a highly skilled player, and the tabbed pdf music will give you a lot to work on. But I would like to see him explain the context theory behind the examples. It just seems so random, and he assumes yu have a pretty good foundation in theory.This is definitely for intermediate players with some background knwlodege of chords and blues. I didn't find that it taught me blues rhythm as much as it gives me numerous examples of progressions. Still, there is no explanation of how these examples fit into the structure of the blues."
3,the art of blues rhythum,"this is an instructional dvd. not my style. very boring. i love ford and all his work as he is an exceptional guitarist, but this dvd isn't for me."
3,A diffent look at the blues,"To be honest I had not heard of Robben Ford before buying the dvd. His style is unique. In this dvd he gives an insight on how he creates. Ford demonstrates his playing technique. The price for the dvd is much cheaper than a private lesson. So what can be gained from it depends on your own guitar experince level. I consider myself an intermediate guitarist most of the dvd I grasped, but some of it was beyond me. This dvd I wouldn't recommend to a beginner. Others should consider the dvd for the experience of new knowledge from a noted blues artist, Robben Ford."
2,Too general,"I had a bad feeling before I even opened this book. I guess that had to do with the picture of the Maroon Bells on the cover - which are nowhere near Rocky Mountain National Park.This book talks a lot about bringing pets into the park, obtaining permits, keeping mosquitos away, and what kind of camper I should buy. To me, this is pretty useless information. I need maps and route descriptions for day hikes. This book devotes less than 30 pages to that subject.I have a camper, I know what bug spray is used for and I don't take pets with me on hikes. If you've never been outdoors, there may be some useful information here, but it seems like common knowledge to me."
3,Average,"Though there are a view of excellent chillout listening material on this double compilation, it is mostly filled with average songs - nothing inspiring or innovating. This seems to be the recent trend with the Cafe del Mar series. If this continues, the series will get less popular and die eventually. Not the best Dreams- cd from CDM. Tracks 4 (cd1), 1 & 4 (cd 2) are quite remarkable."
4,Good bu Vol 3 is better,"This is nice, but I prefer Volume 3 better than Volume 4. But almost anything CDM label puts out is excellent for parties."
4,Solid Tepper,"This was the second Tepper book I read, and it remains in my head as one of her more solid achievements. The story is engaging and like in all of her other books, there are commentaries on religion, society, and what not (which is not surprising to a Tepper fan) but I like this one best, along with Sideshow and Fresco. This book has a more coherent plot and style, and while not without its plot twists, made more sense than some of her other work like 'Gibbon's Decline and Fall' and 'The Visitor'."
3,Too Krishna-centric...,"Objective analysis and much needed background info take second-place to Prabhupada's salesmanship. He habitually uses the purports (and occasionally the passage translations) as an opportunity to promote his own brand of Krishna-centric theology.Prabhupada inserts his seemingly trademarked phrase, ""Krishna consciousness,"" at any given opportunity. The word-for-word translations (not to be confused with the passage translations) offer some respite from this barrage, but they can be a pain to read given the grammatical differences between Sanskrit and English.If you decide to get this, my advice is to read only the passage translations--and do that, even, with a grain of salt. I'm not sure if unadulterated translations of the Gita exist, but if you're looking for even a semblance of objectivity you wont find it in this read."
1,Hare krishna propaganda..,"I love the Bhagavad Gita, I must have read it dozens of times.But this ""translation"" is all about: ""these words mean:chant hare krishna, don't drink caffeine etcetera.. doas the hare krishna movement tells you to do"".Please compare this translation with other translations,before making up your mind about this great book."
2,Hindi Font,"I bought the Kindle version of this book and I was really looking forward to reading it. However, I had to return it because the Hindi Fonts were not visible; square boxes littered the pages where a character should be."
4,Inexpensive and Good,"This book contains not only a translation of the Gita, but the original Sanskrit text, transliteration, and word-for-word translation. It's very useful for Sanskrit students wanting to have their own hand at translating this very popular Hindu poem.While I don't agree completely with the interpretation advocated in this translation by the Krishna Consciousness movement, it is interesting to read how others have interpreted the Gita.The meaning of each verse is explained, and further tidbits of interesting information is included. This book is well worth the price."
1,Total Distortion of a great spiritual treasure,"This is NOT the Bhagavad Gita (Thus it's deceptive title The Bhagavad Gita As It Is) but a cultish distortion. It twists the true meaning beyond recognition to serve the philosophy of the Hare Krishna Movement. Essentially the Gita teaches many paths to enlightenment whereas the Krishna Consciousness Movement claims the Gita endores only one, thiers. Read the Bhagavad Gita. Steer clear of this farce. One little tidbit should suffice: the Gita teaches meditation as a spiritual path--this commentary claims that mediation was only valid in the past 'when people lived 60,000 years, but not now with modern lifespans.' If you can swallow this sort of [fluff] you may be ripe for the Krishna Consciosness movement. Obviously all of the five star reviews are written by Krishna Consciousness devotees (who believe they can take 'easy journeys to distant planets'), so caveat emptor. Read the Bhagavad Gita, not this Bhagavad Gita As It Is."
5,"Great for 6th grade student, History class","Is the most amazing book ever, you really understand who you are,wake up your real consciousness, and how spiritual is the real value in life and not material. This book will help you with self esteem problem, anger problems,depression, and you find the answer of so many doubts.I recommended this book to everybody, and special for the kids,for they do not get lost in this material society.:)"
2,"Bhagavad ""as it is"" to Hare Krishna Movement","I have studied and benefited from repeated readings several translations /commentaries of the Gita for 35 years. Upon reading this commentary I noticed some of the interpretations were 180 degrees different from anything I'd read before; that's the point, I believe, of adding ""As it is"" to the Bhagavad Gita's title. One thing that is repeadedly harped on is that all other commentaries are misguided and the Krishna devotees should avoid reading them, much better than here.Ahem. Might I direct you to Eknath Easwaran's non-sectarian and wonderful 3 volume commentary and translation of the Bhagavad Gita. Volume one is entitled ""The End of Sorrow."" This is a much better place to begin, in my honest opinion."
4,The whole truth and nothing but the truth?,Is there any book that is the whole truth and nothing but the truth?All books are to be read with an open mind.
4,Really good CD,I originally bought this for the RITM mix of Milk by Garbage... This was way cheaper than buying the disk that Garbage was selling. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the other tracks on the disk were. All songs are intertwined and all high quality. Highly recommend.
2,"This book should be entitled ""The Graham Name""","I really, really wanted to like this book.I was looking for a deeper understanding of the Name Above All Names - of Jesus. The role of a name in the Hebrew culture, the power inherent in Jesus, an exploration of the name God gives (Revelation 2:17).If you are looking for anecdotal stories of Franklin Graham's public appearances (Bush inauguration, Columbine memorial) or his public ministry, Samaritan's Purse, you may be satisfied with the book.I think Billy Graham is the finest evangelist of our generation and can't wait to see him when we all get home with the thousands of thousands he has touched for the kingdom of God. I applaud his heart for God, his ministry, his family, and his son.But this particular book didn't meet my expectations. I was hoping for more of Jesus."
2,overrated and sounds dated,"This album is not bad but it is no masterpiece. The songs sound old, very garage-rock. Some of it is unlistenable. Its pretty tough to listen to the whole thing at once.""Alone again or"" however is an incredible and unique song. UFO does a cool version of this song."
5,all things must pass,"most everything which will be said about arthur lee will probably be on line rather than in a steemy memphis funeral home.but, to leave a thing of beauty behind such as forever changes will have a profound effect on many, many people.be sure to pass this album on to your friends and children as no one will be able to say that they saw this old rocker performing some old 60's stuff and it was really really good"
3,Grossly overrated,"""Alone Again Or"" is one of the best songs I have ever heard. So why does the rest of the album fall off so sharply? Most of the songs here are bland, derivative imitations of other psychadelia. Lyrics are decent but not impressive, and often pretentious. I will say two things on this album's behalf: 1) The poor sound quality of this particular edition probably took away from my enjoyment, and the remaster is undoubtedly better. 2) Had Love stuck it out longer, I think they could have become a great band. This album shows potential that is not fully realized, due to the failure to have completely defined their sound and style as a standout from other bands."
5,FOREVER CHANGES: CALLS THE SHOTS OVER 30 YEARS ON!!,"as an exercise write down all the bands that have (A) been influenced by FOREVER CHANGES or (B) directly stolen from it. Be prepared to make a long list.Once again it falls into the category of if you dont own this then you need to seek medical advice.LOVE (in all their guises) never came anywhere near producing something as wonderful,dynamic and awesomely spine tingling as this and it remains ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS EVER MADE.OK so what you waiting for?ps FREE ARTHUR LEE!!"
2,An okay CD.,"I think this CD is not for everyone. I enjoyed this CD because it had three great tracks, No Association, Cemetery, and Learn To Hate. I think the rest of the tracks seem a little whiny (NO OFFESE). But, if you enjoy Silverchair this is a great CD to own."
4,Seether=Wannabe Silverchair,"I get the impression that the guys in Seether listened to this cd a decade ago and said to themseves, ""my god, their OUR AGE! WE could do that!"" And by the time Seether was a major act Silverchair had already come of age and run their course. In other words, Slverchair is good."
5,ok...,"first off, silverchair obviously had a major influence via the works of kurt dave and krist. but other than that, hey person knocking nirvana, if you want to be listened to you should learn how to spell. other than that this is a superb album, every track where it should and sounding like it should. for a group of young fellas, they really knew how to make a record. best of record is learn to hate and the obvious songs like freak and abuse me, i mean who else but daniel johns could make ""throw the saiyans overboard"" mean so much more."
5,A very unusual novel...,"...and a BEAUTIFULLY crafted one. TPAoL has some of the most striking prose I've ever come across in a work of fiction. It also has some of the finest scene setting and character development. Too bad the cover and title give the book a somewhat 'cheesy' look. I had this one on my shelf for awhile before giving it a shot. Very glad I did. JM is a superb writer of historical fiction. If his other novels are as good as this one, he has one hell of an oeuvre in the making. Don't miss TPAoL!"
5,A definitive book on American sexuality,"There is so much in the book which can easily be disagreed with. No matter, if you want some of the more insightful and helpful commentary dealing with sexuality and intimacy issues, buy this book pronto. Deida is pretty unique, and pretty fantastic."
4,wonderful stuff,"Mundy,a native of Birr,Co.Offaly is a singer/songwriter much similar to fellow Irishman Paddy Casey.His influences include Bob Dylan.Jellylegs is very good for a debut,while not really fulfilling his potential.Some truly classics songs include 'Gin&Tonic Sky','Life's A Cinch',and 'To You I Bestow'(featured on Romeo&Juliet soundtrack.Waiting eagerly and patiently for album#2.Buy it."
3,Thin Material But it Looks Great,"This may disappoint you if you are looking for a heavy duty cover. It came in the mail in a large envelope. Oddly though, it's more durable than it looks. We would buy one again. We didn't want to do the advertising for our RV company using the cover they put onto our spare tire, heavy duty as it may have been. So we took this new one and covered the tire cover of our rv company. It looks great. Ironically, the tire cover with the US Flag has a ""Made in China"" tag sewn into the front seam. Scissors solved that problem."
1,Is it just me?,"I love a good spy novel as much as the next guy, but this book is so poorly written I have not been able to get past the first 25 pages. Think I'm exaggerating? Listen to this: ""a rack of clouds drifted across the hunter's moon so rapidly it looked as if a motion picture had been speeded up"" or ""a mutilated Bavarian clock.... sent the seconds ricocheting from wall to wall of the shabby room"". These beauties and more come in the first few pages of the book. Littell's dialogue is worse. I know I'm going against the grain here, but this book is a stinker."
2,"Fair summary of historical facts, poor characters","Ok summary of CIA history, but the characters are flat, utterly uninteresting, and as you go along involuntarily comical and increasingly annoying. I read a lot of this stuff, but this book is just horrible on purely literary grounds."
5,A historical spy thriller that hits the mark,"If you enjoy spy thrillers, you will not be able to put this book down. The book paints a detailed picture of the clandestine agency starting just after the Second World War and moving forward in time. I particularly enjoyed the interlacing of historically acurate events with thrilling fictonal adventure.If you miss the days of the good Cold War spy stories, pick (or, since it has 892 pages, heft) this book up. On par with the works of Le Carre, Richard Condon or Ludlum."
1,Do not buy!,"This appeared to be a great gift for my 5 yr old and had good ratings, but looks can be deceiving. This product was purchased as a Christmas gift, but did not work properly out of the box (one of the links did not work), then a couple weeks later another link did not work either. I contacted fisher price and was told that I would have to purchase more links if I wanted ones that work because Elmo and Dragontales were no longer supported. I contacted them again and complained that they should not be selling a product if it is not up to date, and was offered a voucher for half of what I paid for this item. I am very disappointed! Mattel is no longer making this product and parts are no longer available."
3,Frustrating unless child's mouse abilities are VERY good,"My 3 yo son gets very frustrated by this toy bc the games require him to move the mouse into a pretty small area, and he is not that adept at the mouse yet. There aren't very many activities that do NOT require mouse usage, and it doesn't tell you before you purchase them which don't.Also, some of the 'keys' are geared towards different age groups. For instance, the Arthur games are better for a much older age group than the ones on the 'Fisher Price Dog' key. But ALL of them say '3 and up'. There are whole paragraphs to read on some of the Arthur games, which of course my 3 yo can't do. I have 5 of the keys and I have only found ONE game that uses the keyboard instead of the mouse.I think I am going to put the whole system away for a while until he can click on a very specific target with the mouse. :-("
1,two Easy Links and Still Not Working...need help,"I purchased this item (PBS version) for my son for Xmas, installed it on our HP Laptop w/Win XP/Verizon HighSpeed Internet & VRZN Internet Security Suite. Software was there and working properly but the EasyLink hardware isn't recognized on any of the USB ports when plugged in. When I plug the EasyLink USB in to my laptop the light on the EasyLink blinks once and goes off. So I returned this one that they did not have any more and picked up the Disney version and installed it, same trouble persisted. Whenever I plug this in it doesn't show up in any of the USB ports. All firewalls had been disabled. Any one that can help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Anxious to get this going for my son."
1,This was pulled from the shelf,I got this so Harmony could go to the web sites. I saw this when we were on vacation I had never saw it in a store. I gave it to her for her 3rd. Birthday. I hooked it up the next morning on my laptop . It wouldn't go to any of the links. so I called Fisher Price they told me it was pulled from the self back in 2010 so I returned it to Amazon without any problems.
4,A welcome addition,"We got this for our 4 year old for Christmas this year because she is always begging to get on the computer but never fails to ""do something really bad"" (to quote the older kids) to the computer when she is allowed to use it. This was super easy to install (in fact, our 10 year old took care of installation) and she has really enjoyed playing with it. It keeps her busy (and out of trouble) for at least an hour, which ensures everyone in our house continues to have clean underwear and dinner. Our 6 year old actually likes to play with this a lot too and I think they'll be happy with the three characters that came with the set for quite some time before we have to even consider buying some add-ons."
5,Fisher-Price Easy Link Internet Launch Pad,One of the best items purchased for my grandchild. Easy to set-up and easy to use. Very educational and fun.
3,Not for small children,We bought this for our 2 year old and it is definitely made for children who are at a reading age. My son still loves to play with it because he can click his little heart out and we know he will not be able to ruin anything on the computer. So we will most likely get more use out of it the older he gets but it still fun for the meantime.
4,Surreal,"I picked up this Ludlum at the airport on the way to Switzerland. Prior to beginning the book, I had had no idea that the story was set in the Switzerland/Austria region . I felt myself really drawn to the descriptions of the places and people, so that even though some were ficticious names and places, there were enough real places mentioned to lend to the ""believability"" of the piece and give ""a ring of truth"" to it all. It made it seem just a bit surreal to leave the Zurich Flughafen(airport) and head towards ""St. Gallen"".. and pass signs to ""Chur"" on the way.Wow!! I'd just been there in the book...I like that Mr. Ludlum does enough research on the places that he takes you to, so that you can really see it in your mind's eye"
4,Excellent storytelling by a fine writer.,"Ludlam pretty much defined his own genre when he began writing, 23 novels ago. I was surprised by how slick and ""packaged"" this novel felt, but it honestly was a great read. There is building suspense in multiple plotlines that keeps the reader's interest. The characterizations and dialog seem a bit thin, but they do the job and make this a fast and easy read--the equivalent of a James Bond type adventure. The scenes set in Zurich, Switzerland really pull you into the setting, and the world of multimillionaire Max Hartman and his investment banker son Ben are truly fascinating. Fun, action packed and satisfying."
1,predictable and preposterous,"If you want to waste time reading a book you've read before--probably many times before--then this one is for you. It's 600+ pages of formulas and cliches. All-powerful industrialists conspiring to rule the world. The high-tech creation of a new master race. A one-man rescue and destruction of the Evil Empire ensconed in an impregnable Alpine castle. A mind-numbing progression of traps, blackmail and false identities, all of which are easily anticipated by the reader (but not by our heroes). This book has it all--unfortunately."
2,I became a little bored,"When i first started reading it I was captivated. The plot is interesting and intriguing. The characters are fairly well developed. However, as I read on into the novel, I felt that it started to drag on and I lost most of my initial interest. It was a blessing to just be able to finish it. All in all, it is a very good idea, but it is simply too long."
3,My first Ludlum - Exciting but anti-climactic,This is my first Ludlum novel.Pluses:* Exciting story.* Good twists.* Fast paced.Minuses:* A lot of characters described in great detail last just a single chapter leaving you with a feeling of lost cause and wasted time.* Some sub-plots are unexplained in the end. (e.g. why was Ben attacked in the first place? )
1,"In a word ""tedious""","The first few hundred pages were fairly decent; an interesting foundation (a secret corporation founded by multi-national, powerful people), but just becomes tedious with all of the foreign words thrown in haphazardly, multiple characters who appear to have no foundation for being in the story, and a predictable storyline that starts falling apart."
4,Passion of Mind...intoxicating,"I found this film intoxicating; I'd never heard of it, and found if on Showtime. I liked the premise of the film. Is it possible to live two lives?? On in a dream and another ""real""?????The film was intertaining. The cinematography was nice, unique takes on ordinary scenes. I completely enjoyed the film, to the extent I own it now. I can watch it over and over."
5,Incredible !!,"For you James Taylor fans out there , it just does not get any better than this !His best album , period ."
3,Hourglass,"It took me several listens to really enjoy this CD from James Taylor. I really like the songs ""Enough to be on your way"" and ""Walking my baby back home."" Walking is a remake from an old Nat King Cole song, but James does a great job. You can hear him having fun with this song.I like his older CDs better, but this one has some catchy tunes in it too."
5,James Taylor's Best Album Since Sweet Baby James,"Having been a long-time fan of JT, I listened to ""Hourglass"" with as much enthusiasm as I did when I heard his voice for the first time 20 years ago. After one spin I was hooked. Have no reservations about buying this album, it is a masterpiece."
4,"All Bruce? What about WHO, Dylon, Gloria, Tom, and all the others","Why is Bruce the artist listed for all the songs? The music was written by ""Various Artists""!!!Please change the names to reflect the proper artists. They deserve the credit for making the movie that much more enjoyable."
3,what??,"Are you serious?? The "" political song from the '70's"" Cuba Gooding is singing is ""What's Going on?"" by Marvin Gaye...a clasic... how do you not know this?"
1,help- jerry maquire soundtrack,"I am looking for the name of the song that was not listed on the soundtrack, it is played during the scence when cuba gooding is talking to jerry maguire on the phone right before his famous line of ""show me the money""?"
3,Where's Mingus????,"This soundtrack is missing the song ""Hatian Fight Song"" from the bedroom scene. Outrageous tune. Check it out on ""Pithecanthropus Erectus"" by Charles Mingus."
3,The song playing at the end...,"...is track #6, ""We Meet Again (Theme From 'Jerry Maguire')"" by Nancy Wilson.(I noticed someone posted a review asking about the ""I know the language of your laugh"" lyric, so I thought I'd post a quick review and the answer to that question)K, here's my quick review: ""We Meet Again"" is a great song on a decent soundtrack. The consensus here seems to be that a lot of great songs were left out, and I agree. A music CD has a max capacity of 74 minutes --- too little time for the JM soundtrack considering there are enough great tunes in the movie for a double album soundtrack (like Forrest Gump). You could almost argue Cameron Crowe does too good a job at soundtracking his movies...Anyway, it's a good soundtrack and well worth your money."
2,no Tom Petty..,"I was looking for song ""free fallin"" in the music cd. its not there, it is perhaps the best song of the movie. I dont know why it is not there in the cd."
2,not too exciting,I got a recomendation to buy this for my daycare. My kids only like one of the songs. It is not to engaging and we listen to our other CD's. this one got put away and probably wont be played again.
5,Pure fun for everyone...,"I have been a preschool teacher for over nine years. And in that time, I've listened to a lot of children's music. 10 Carrot Diamond has got to be one of the best children's albums today. The songs are easy to learn and memorize. (Lyrics are printed inside the jacket cover.) Making up routines to go along with the songs is very easy. ""I Wanna be a Dog"" is one of the favorite songs the kids love to do at circle time. They love getting down on all fours and pretending to be little puppies. ""Four Hugs a Day"" and ""I am a Pizza"" are also classroom favorites anytime of the day. The entire cd is just plain fun to listen to...and sing along with. And when you put it on with a group of kids, chances are you won't be singing alone."
3,Obsessed Jenna Elfman,Does anyone know the name of the song at the very begininnig of the movie when she is taking a shower?
5,Animation,"Bought this for my grandaughter...of course we watched it together, what a fun movie. I would recommend it for the adults too!"
2,SPACE CHUMPS!,"A very disappointing animated film with lackluster animation and really uninspired characters. 'Space Chimps' is probably the worst animated feature film I've seen in a long time.Even the good cast of voices can't do anything with this tedious and cheap looking film. If you want to put the kids to sleep, you might want to put this slow moving dud on. I guess the bar has been set too high after `Wall E' and `Horton Hears A Who`, because this film just doesn't cut it.The DVD release is also pretty bland."
1,"used it for torture!!!,better than waterboarding","movie was boring whether you are an adult or a child. Dont be fool by the the trailer clips,plenty of techo nonsense talk that young kids wouldnt comprehend. A nerdy tween wouldnt even like this movie. Flat background animation,cheaply made movie. charactors have boring flat personalities. You couldnt paid me to watch this again!!Thank god I didnt order the sequel when I brought this one.I should send my copy to Gizmo. Too bad Amazon forces their customers to rate trash aleast one star,I give it minus a gazillion stars"
3,As Not seen on TV!,From the creator of Babylon 5 and Rising Stars comes a basic story of a newspaper reporter and a mysterious stanger on the trail of a serial killer with supernatural elements thrown in. This book lacks the grand epic scope of Straczynski's other work and reads more like a made-for-TV movie (you can almost imagine the commercial breaks between chapters). Its quick pace and peppering of social commentary saves this book and makes this a good beach reading material.
4,For the wife,"My wife is in love with Charlie Brown and gang, more specifically Snoopy. But, this is a classic and always will be in my mind."
5,Charlie's finest hour!,"Charlie Brown is at his best in his first film as Charlie addreses his own insecurities and gets the remarkable achievement of going to a major spelling bee only to loose when final victory is so close. Along the way we are treated to a brilliant rendition of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata with some wonderful gothic imagry. We have Snoopy at the Rockefeller plaza skating around and letting his imagination run wild, and we have a great flying sequence as Snoopy does an air battle. There's so many wonderful moments it's hard to list. Rod McKuen's theme is just so poignant for the ending. After Charlie looses he realizes through simple images that life has indeed moved on and that he's going to be OK. The ending is just so moving and to have that juxtiposed with smart and quite witty scenes early on is such a rare thing in any film. The biggest shame is that this is NOT available on DVD. This is a lost treasure and I'm glad at least we can see it on VHS!Rod McKuen"
4,Mr. Clancy does it again !!!,"Tom Clancy has done it again. Excecutive ordes features: Jack Ryan who now has become president of ""the free world"" USA. This Book is good, but it is to damn long. In my version witch is an overseas version there is 1272 pages, with a vary small writing. But then after all, it is a good book, and if you have read The hunt for Red October, Ob-center etc. then read this."
4,Just Dues!,"Yes the book was too long, yes it was too heavy to carry to bed at night and yes it got surpy - but buddy does Jack Ryan ever kick butt!This is the ending that every American dreams of - I just read it and it's the week of the 4th of July - God Bless America.My only disparaging remarks would have to be concerning the last few chapters. The war scenes were too in depth and technical and became just too hard to follow by us laymen. He should keep this techno jargo in his non-fiction armored cav books.The funny thing - I visualize as I read and I kept seeing Harrison Ford. I think this calls for a movie, only in this case it would have to be a mini-series!Great job Mr. Clancy! What happens to Jack now?"
2,if you want to kill your time - read it!,"His good guys are soooo good - they save the world every now and then, they are very caring, extremely honest. I guess they all have big and clefted chins, blue and terribly sincere eyes. His bad guys are really bad. I wonder, why he did not put scenes, where some bad Iranians or Iraquis would devour alive small defenseless children with large and sad eyes? And just for the information of Tom Clancy: DNA and RNA consist of nucleic bases rather than aminoacids. He really needs an editor."
1,Waste of Time,"This book was not only boring, but long. Instead of influencing peace in this world, this book influences war between countries in strife (Iran and USA). I personally feel like burning this book--but that is my opinion."
2,"Worth every second, every page","I'm not going to waste your time with a book review that's as long as the book itself, so I'm going to get straight to the point and say I absolutely loved this book. Though I love stories/movies of this genre, I'd never read a Tom Clancy novel before reading Executive Orders. That's about to change. A large portion of this book is about how Jack Ryan learns to become president, which by its nature makes this a very political story. However, it was written so that readers not up-to-speed on political know-how and jargon (like myself) could easily understand and follow along. Basically, you learn about the presidency and its twists and turns just as President Ryan learns, and I think that's what makes this book unbelievably easy to read...despite its 1,300-plus pages. In short, this was one hell of a story that I couldn't put down. I even learned a thing or two. Totally worth the price of admission, five stars."
5,Really a great novel,"After reading Debt of Honor, I was convinced that Clancy was a great writer. After reading Executive Orders I can only say it's even better than the previous one. All loose strings are solved, you can feel the tension as you read the pages. It can really inmerse you in everyone of the characters, and then it just turn into a great novel. With a very good plot that forces you to keep reading."
3,It starts out kind of slow and then fizzles out altogether,"Success has definitely gone to Tom Clancey's head. How many trees did you kill to get this one into print, Tom? You need to get back to your roots. You are going in the wrong direction"
1,"America good, rest of world evil","Oh my god. The only cause for me to read the novel was that it was the only book I had with me on my holiday. The worst thing about Executive Orders is that bunch of patriotic crap. America, again the only free country in the world, the rest is either evil (as China, India, Iran) or non-existent (as whole Europe). Why aren't the NATO countries involved in the little war, where's the UNO, why does no country help the US? Just because Clancy has to tell us that America is best and can solve any problem on its own. Additionally, 1000 abbreviations don't make this book any more realistic. Not to talk about that boring description of the tank battle where just persian and arabian stuff bursts in flames."
3,Get it from the library,"This book is a good example of too many confusing and unrelated subplots. In addition, there is very little character development throughout the entire novel. Why must we continue to read about Jack Ryan's rise to power and unending battles against evil, foreign and domestic? I think the peak of Tom Clancy's entertainment value has come and gone. Isn't it time to begin exploring newer plot lines revolving around some fresh characters?"
3,A Book with rather too many plots,"In Executive Order, Jack Ryan comes back again, but with a rather different plot. Or should I say, plots. Although it is a good book, Clancy seems to interweave so many different plots that the reader doesn't know what he's reading after a while.If you expect another Jack Ryan book, this is a good read, but this book can't be read in two or three sits, it needs much more time."
5,An incredible adventure I didn't want to put down!,"Tom Clancy has outdone himself! The through-the-eyes viewpoint of someone forced into the position of the most powerful figure in the world is amazingly fascinating. Tom Clancy captures the essence of the pressures, the temptations and the overwelming emotions of having such power in one's grasp. The story is a pleasure to read, and he ties the various sub-plots together into an exciting thrill-ride that leaves you breathless! This is by far the most interesting and entertaining book I have ever read. Everyone should read it just to get a better understanding of what it is like to be President."
2,long - scanned huge portions. Nothing lost/missed,"Reached a point when I was ""Clan Cave Bear"" out. Couldn't touch Auel again. Ditto Clancy. Too much detail. We really don't need the scientific data. Difficult to keep track of the thready skeins stretching throughout the novel. Of the seemingly thousands of pages, scanned several hundred and don't feel I missed a thing. Jack Ryan and Cathy will always come out of top - it's a shame however, they have to climb over such an enormous dung hill to reach safety. God bless us all, everyone."
2,Clancy has become victim of his own success,"Clancy has become such a cash cow for his publisher that it appears the publisher no longer even bothers to examine his manuscripts. It's as though Clancy sends all twenty pounds of it over to the publisher with a note attached and something to the effect, ""I want this on the stands in six months. Don't call me. Just do it."" This book should have been edited down at least 400 pages. The publisher is more to blame than Clancy. After all, an author who's settled for 900 pages likely thinks 1200 would have been more appropriate. Clancy's not alone here. Recent efforts by Stephen King, who probably sent his publisher the same note, and John Grisham also screamed out for responsible editing on the part of the publisher. Mr. Clancy and the publisher need to remember that just because we liked 'The Hunt forRedOctober' doesn't mean we'll continue buying Clancy books that short us on originality, craft and story telling"
5,One of the best I've ever read,"This book is one of the most interesting Clancy has ever written, and most certainly the longest! Though some may feel that the book is an overkill, I personally think that a longer book gives us more chance to be immersed in the unique atmosphere that Clancy has created for the book. It also provides space for a more intense and complicated plot and sub-plots in order to be able to express the true feelings and emotions of the characters. I especially feel for Catherine Ryan -- she's just an ordinary mother who cares for her children as much as any other, yet in just a few days time she has suddenly been catapulted from an award-winning surgeon to the First Lady! Apart from the usual Clancy-like intricate developments, this book also provides readers with a chance to experience the human emotions involved in the story"
4,"Worth reading, but it'll take you a while...","Whoa! What a monster of a book! Even though it's a compelling novel this one really needs a strong edit since it's WAY too long, probably twice as long as it needs to be. As in Debt of Honor, there are some exciting moments and the concept of President Ryan is intriguing but muddling your way through the filler to reach those interesting moments can be exhausting. Also, the final scene is too reminiscent of a mediocre action film, the payoff doesn't equal what's been hammered out over the previous 1300 (! ) pgs. Ryan drops a bomb on the Iranian leader that started the biological war. The end. Abrupt and unsatisfying. Still, I find it to be much less confusing and easier to digest than DOH was."
1,Tom Clancy is NOT a great writer ...,"After his previous book there had to be a ""Jack Ryan in the White House"". The result is unwieldy and overblown -- too many (highly improbable) subplots which are handled too coolly by the ""man in command"".Want to read a good Tom Clancy novel? Try ""The Hunt for Red October"", ""Red Storm Rising"", or ""The Cardinal of the Kremlin"".Want to read a very good book about an ordinary man suddenly presented with a big, unexpected task and who tries to do the right thing? Try ""Trustee from the Toolroom"" by Neville Shute -- it may not be in print, but you can probably find it at the library. Oh, I borrowed ""Executive Orders"" from the Library as well, glad I did not waste $9.00 or so on it. Whoever would buy a Tom Clancy in hard cover? -- Miles Thompson"
3,"900 pages = 10, 100 pages = 1 equals 5","Dear Mr. Clancy,I read all your books. This was by far the heaviest one, literally speaking. You are the best when it comes to these wonderfull detailed ""What if..."" techno thrillers. The first 900 pages of ""Jack Ryan as President"" are brilliant: suspense, thrill, action, fun. Great characters, new and old. But what happened on the last 100 pages? All story-lines are gone missing in action except a lengthy battlefield description. Were you afraid of 100 more pages? These last 100 pages were an enormous let-down. But 900 pages of treat, anyway.Yours sincerly, Alexander Loran"
5,Greatest Clancy Book of All!!!!!!!!,"No one writes a book like Clancy. I spent many sleepless nights flying through the pages to discover what happened next. The attack on the daycare center caused me to scream, ""Kill'em, kill'em!"" The book could have been 8,000 pages and I still would have savored every page. My only question now is,""When is the next Ryan book coming out?&quot"
2,A waste of time,"The character of Jack Ryan may be loveable and somewhat captivating, especially as he gets to play the role of the president. There's a certain amount of thrill and action, which is the only reason why I kept on reading. I recommend you don't even start reading it. The first third of the book is really boring and Tom Clancy's story-telling all over the book is too annoying. Clancy writes too much about combat maneuvers and stuff like that which isn't interesting at all. The worst thing is that he tries to get so much into the minds of the characters and he's doing an awful job. It feels so much like he (Clancy) is the only voice and mind in the story. He could have kept the story simple and short. The action would have sufficed."
3,He has given us better.,His attempt at doing a tome on the Ryan presidency makes it an incredibly sluggish read. Only the last 200 pages give some decent action
3,question?,"In page 460: ...the crisscross directory right in the White House... What does the phrase ""crisscross directory"" mean? Is that kinda employee directory of the White House? Could anyone tell me that? Please be specific. Thank you. ^_^"
1,Publisher Did NOT Use SPELLCHECK,"I am a natural speed reader & just received a Kindle for Christmas. I have been downloading favorites to the Kindle & just spent a few hours re-reading Clancy's ""Executive Orders"". The experience was totally spoiled by the HUNDREDS of typos, most typically ""c"" for ""e"" and vice versa. It really ruined the experience of reading a 2041KB (896 pg) book. Didn't anyone ever hear of SPELLCHECK? The book was FIVE STARS but the printing was awful."
3,Not his greatest work - but worth the read,Plot setup was typical Clancy. Build up was outstanding with great anticipation and action occuring all over the world. The execution of the plot was the let down for me. Everything happened one event at a time. The furious turn of events never panned out. Almost as if the book was rushed in the end with less attention paid to the timing of events
5,Tom Clancy gets everything right down to the tiniest detail.,"At 874 pages Executive Orders will give you some seriousreading, but that didn't stop me from finishing it in 2days. From biological warfare on the US to the second war in the Persian Gulf, to a terrorist attack on the First Toddler, and more Constitutional crises than you can count you will be sitting on edge just turning the pages of this book. And reading it has convinced me: I want Jack Ryan for President!"
2,small for size,"when I tried this outfit on my little man, to my surprise it fits small. Its not 12-24mos, its more like 6-12mos. The hat is too small too (and no, my son does not have a big head!)I was very is appointed! I really wanted him to wear it for Sunday games."
5,A beautiful and eclectic tribute.,"This treasure spans a wide range of stylistic impressions of Gershwin (and others) works. We have here musical settings of Jazz, classical, blues, opera and solo piano works. Throughout all of these tracks runs Hancocks mastery of his piano. This is truly one of the gems of my CD collection."
3,Dispassionate Gershwin,"Out of the many jazz pianists who come to mind, few strike me as less ""romantic"" than Herbie Hancock (even the cerebral Lennie Tristano was passionate about his own harmonic system). As a pianist Hancock has always excelled in the areas of smooth, unvarying touch, rock-steady time superior to that of many drummers, intricate but glib, fingery, single-note figures (his indebtedness to Bill Evans has been grossly exaggerated). This is not the musician to be entrusted with recreating the world of George Gershwin, one of America's most romantic, passionate, melodic and lyrical composer-pianists (with formidable left-hand technique to boot). In sum, the album is not a bad representation of Herbie's talents, but it owes any of its Gershwin flavor to the presence of Mitchell and Battle."
3,The Butterfly Secret,"For repressed women from the 1940-50s, this book is sometimes, shocking, but very witty. Must have been very controversial in its day, probably banned by religious organizations, but worth reading."
4,Good Read,"I read this book for my Asian American Studies class, I had really enjoyed it. The book has interrelating short stories, some parts were more interesting than others. Overall, it was a good and quick read."
2,Harley spare tire cover..,Don't expect any great quality with the cover. Its is a very thin skin they used for the cover and will split or rip at the seemesif you try to stretch it over the larger sized tires.. Barely fit over my 225/75/16 tires..But for 20. bucks and change its OK..
3,Harley Davidson spare tire cover,"I purchase this tire cover, and it looked great for a great price, but doesnt fit 31"" tire like it says it does. I am returning the product because of this. I haven't been able to find a Harley Davidson spare tire cover anywhere to fit my 31"" spare."
2,size not expected,"The description describes that it fits 27""-31"" tires. Unfortunately, the 31"" in innaccurate. I ordered for a spare tire for my truck...tire exactly 31"" across. There was no way of making the cover fit over my spare tire. Have returned due to this issue."
1,Pretty design. Lousy Performance,"I bought one directly though Ott-Lite about two years ago. That one lasted about 9 months before it would not turn on. If it was near my cpu speakers it would make loud buzzing sounds through the sets. Couldn't figure that one out. The second light I bought at Home Depot and it lasted about 10 months. Every time that I turn it on it does nothing but flicker! I expected better than this lousy product. The light was exellent, but the product just didn't last."
1,Not typical Nine West quality,"I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand. I would not purchase this item again. I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work."
5,the best again,"this update is, as expected, as good as the original and well worth the money .... a must have for the HR generalist"
3,Doesn't exsplain how to do the excercises,"This Book is a good supplement for information on Buteyko, but you will not learn how to do the breathing excercises from this book. I downloaded the James Hooper manual from here http://www.nqnet.com/catalog/paypal.html and after practicing Buteyko for a month, I am asthma free. I even scored 100% lung function on my test yesterday. It was only 60% three months ago. My doctor was amazed and even asked me to give him more information on Buteyko. It really does work, but you won't get the basics on how to preform the excercises from this book."
4,Feathermark by Gintare,"If you liked Earthless, her first album, then you are guaranteed to enjoy this. Not quite as ethereal and oriental as the previous album, but with overtones of Bjork and Kate Bush, this is as pleasant as it gets.Gintare's vocals are amazing. Highly recommended listening."
5,You're Kidding Me.........,"This is some sort of childhood movie de ja vu that has creeped me out for years. My younger brother and I are 15 months apart and very close and we always bring up the movie about the boy who loses his hair and they spread peanut butter on his head to grow it back. For a long time I didn't know the name of the movie, so I went typing every possible thing I could remember into google until the title comes up. I was so surprised that so many people thought it was a dream too. You don't know how many times I would ask my mother about that movie and how she never remembered the title either. Now that I'm pushing 25, I'm going to go and buy this movie for myself and send a copy to my brother. This is awesome, in a weird, crazy, twisted sort of way."
3,So I'm not crazy,"I just had the same experience as most other reviewers. Last night, while watching The Office, one of the characters had gum stuck in his hair and put peanut butter on it to get it out. A random vision popped in my head of a kid growing really long hair after putting peanut butter on his bald head. I asked my husband if he remembered such a movie, but he just thought I was crazy. I'm so glad to find that this movie actually exists. I remember being really scared after watching this movie as a child and I can still recall most of the sceens from it some 20 years later. I don't think I have any interest in watching it again because I don't want to ruin the magic of having watched it through the eye's of a child. My experience with it now, I'm sure, would be very different."
5,Finally Found,"It all started in my Advanced Fiction Writing Course. Our visiting professor, Robert Morgan was out of town, and resident Fiction professor, William Hallberg was running the shop. We were discussing another student's work, when suddenly a discussion about hair came up. I mentioned that the serial killer could make paintbrushes out of hair, and another student responded with ""like The Peanut Butter Solution."" It was like a divine revealation had been given to me.You see, I've been searching for this film since I was about six. Unfortunately, no one has ever known what I was talking about. Now I feel complete and this film will be on my birthday list, despite the fact that I am now 22!Thank you Jeremy and Amazon.com"
1,Pitch Black!,"If you're blind, you'll probably enjoy this movie. If your eyesight is average, then you may want to throw your remote at your DVD player. This film is so darkly lit and photographed that my screen was totally black at least 85 per cent of the time. I tried to lighten the picture, I tried everything, but could see almost nothing about what was happening on the screen. I did catch a nano second of a big mouth opening and then the rest was lost in perpetual shadows. I saw this movie in a theater the first time and really liked it. I do wish the camera and lightning guys had thought about how all this scary darkness would translate on the TV screen. It doesn't. They shoulda called this movie: PITCH BLACK!"
5,Totally Rocked :-),The movie arrived in perfect condition and was not tampered with at all. Plays excellent no problems :-)
2,"""B"" Horror movie","There's nothing wrong with ""B"" horror movies-I like some (The Unnamable, Pumpkin Head, etc etc), but this was not memorable. There were some scary scenes, but overall, it was 2 hours I'll never get back."
4,The Relic Review,"Enjoyed the book the movie was somewhat less, but then they always are. However it was a very decent account considering the time limit."
4,I'll always love the UncleFloyd Show!!!,"This DVD is great! Not being in the NJ/NYC/PA areas for years, had me longing for the UNCLE FLOYD show! I thought it was gone forever! I decided to check out Amazon.com and to my surprise: there it was!!! The DVD and links to the show!! I just hope he will put out more DVD's!! I laughed as if I had never seen these skits before! Thanks soooo much for having this available for the public to purchase!!! MORE,MORE,MORE!!!!"
1,The least enjoyable story of Elizabeth's life,"I've read many books about Elizabeth, both history & historical fiction, and this one is the least enjoyable of anything I've read. It is ridiculously inaccurate; many actual events, quotes, etc. are mangled and misused by the author to no good effect other than to make Elizabeth very unlikable - perhaps that was the intent? There are rantings at the beginning of each section that were downright annoying, and the author portrayed Elizabeth as neurotic and unstable throughout the book. It just doesn't jibe with what numerous other writers have shown her to be. There are many other books on this topic more worth reading, such as The Diary of Anne Boleyn, Brief Gaudy Hour, etc. This one is sure to disappoint true Tudor history fans."
3,"Good, clean writing--But Utterly Plotless, Borring and Devoid of a Morsel of Suspense","This book is written in a nice, clean way such that if you want to escape from a stressful world into a borring, plain, unbiased one...then this is a good book for you to read. However, if you want to feel attached to the characters, drawn into a plot and a plight, then this is NOT a good book to read. As other reviewers have mentioned, Elizabeth is nothing more than a ninny who acts as a pawn for others to toy with. Not only is this not what one desires from a heroine, but also we don't care. Miles does not make the reader engage in a ""real time"" experience with Elizabeth, such that we do not care what happens to her. This said, the book is (as others have mentioned) successful at capturing a ""feel"" of Elizabeth's court and reign."
5,engaging and educational,"It mixes both the facts of Elizabethan life as well as giving vivd life to the days in a world which can only be described as diabolical. plots, intrigues, love and lust are dramatic and engaging. Miles adds to the piognancy by slipping in phrases from plays and poems of the time, a fun extra to Elizabethan literture buffs. A MUST!!"
4,"fascinating, but over long","This was a very interesting read. However, the pace seemed to drag a little for me towards the end in regards to the wars etc. But apart from that, I loved the self deprecating humour (especially as she got older and was dismayed at how her body was sagging!) and the historical facts, which were very interesting. I look forward to reading more about this time period, but from Mary, Queen of Scots' perspective."
2,Ordered large assorted Swedish Fish. Got small red ones,"I love assorted large Swedish Fish. They're kind of hard to find where I live in NJ. So when I found this place, Bayside Candy, in Mineola NY, I was excited to get some. I received the package today only to be very disappointed. Instead of the large assorted I had ordered, I received the small red ones. They're ok but they're not what I ordered. Glad I didn't opt for the 5 lb bag. I do not recommend"
1,Inconsistent Results,"Bought this tester about 4 months ago. First time it seemed to work fine.Second time on start up, it failed to detect known hot lines.As a safety precaution, I always test against a known hot power cord before starting work."
3,Semi-reliable tester,"Not always reliable, doesnt always pick up thru thicker cabling and also gives some false readings. Mainly purchased to help identify circuit locations."
3,No sensitive enough,"I put this thing on top of a hot cable, it wouldn't sense the volt unless it is next to bare copper."
5,Not exactly non-contact,"You do have to touch the wire for the tester to light and beep.It does what it does, you can also use it to check for damaged electronic wires in appliances."
2,Uhhhh...,"This is a nice idea for a tool, but I'm concerned by the tendency of it to not read any voltage unless it is held exactly right. Maybe that's just a fluke. ;-)Seems to not be sensitive enough. So, I find that I thoroughly test multiple times. In the end, I'm more concerned that I'm going to be electrocuted than I was when I used a regular volt meter."
1,"What is going on, or off","I for the most part like Fluke, they are the name to buy when you want a good tester. So that is why I bought the Fluke non-contact tester. But it goes off when it is in your hand, or you move it to much and so on. Than when I checked a ck it said it was off and I know it was on. Than I checked it again it said it was on. That was the end of that tester, I could never trust it again. I have found the greenlee tester to work the best, I trust it for the most part, I have been doing this for a long time, so it is always hot in my eyes."
1,Poor Quality,"This tester barley turns on, then when you try to push the button to turn it off, it's luck if it goes off or not. It's really bad, so bad that I'm probably just going to throw mine out."
5,Great tool to keep in your back pocket,"You never know exactly when you'll need this, but you'll be glad you have it when you come across a circuit you thought was off but was really on. Small enough to keep in a shirt pocket, doesn't take up room in your tool belt either. No excuse not to carry on you. Beeps and lights up when detects voltage."
5,the us gov vs reality,This is an amazing true story and shows how corrupt our government (and educational institutions have been. That a prime minister and us president could murder so many people in order to manipulate their people is outrageous. That our government (and Englands) kept it covered up for 60 years is a red flag to our citizens.
4,very cute,"Cute and colorful, but the back of the mat doesn't have those little spikey things to hold it down. OK for the back seat."
1,dead battery,You would think they would at least put a new battery in a reconditioned tool. The saw seems to work fine but the battery lasts about 2 minutes. Any savings I received from buying a used tool will be gone with the purchase of a new battery. beware.
5,Outstanding beginning workbook,This is a great starting point for anyone who plans to travel or wants a quick functional facility in Spanish. One of few I have seen that shows how to pronounce the Spanish words in the body of the text so a novice need not flip back and forth or think too much.
5,Useful book for the terminally ill person and their family,"Persons ethically opposed to this book need not, and should not read it. For almost ten years, Final Exit has been the accepted handbook for self-deliverance and assisted suicide for the dying person whose suffering is unbearable to them. Useful chapters on the law, communicating with others, and precise 'how to' end it details. There is no such other book available on the open market. Thousands of people have made good use of it to make their own decisions."
4,Appreciating Life,"What I like most about this man is that he genuinely appreciates life and encourages people to live....surprised? This book is not aimed at everyone, only the terminally ill. He strongly discourages people from taking their own life unless they're sick. I respect his view that humans have the right to end their existence, even if the problem is mental distress, not physical. I did see a few methods that anyone who can walk themselves to the store with some cash on hand can do. Those methods require no doctor or hard-to-get materials. For sure, anyone with access to a doctor can use this book as a guide to obtain the essential materials needed.I did wish the book had more methods of self deliverence (that are available without prescription), and more detailed instructions on using prescribed drugs."
3,"Compassionate, caring style, but inadequate information","This was a pioneering book when it was first published. It still has the merits of unmatched simplicity and clarity, but there is a MUCH more comprehensive (if harder to read) book on the same subject, ""Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences"" by Geo Stone. I recommend both---they're surprisingly different---but if I were interested in anything other than plastic bag asphyxia (and even here Stone's book is more informative), Stone's would be my first choice."
1,How -To Suicide Text,"Mr Humphery says that this is just options for those that are terminally ill. I had a friend in College whose parents were always screaming at him for his grades, he made Bs and As but they wanted all ""A""s. The week of exams, he did not show up for any of them, his parents did not know where he was. He was found that Friday, with a plastic bag over his head and an empty bottle of pills. He left a note explaining that his parents drove hom to this for not making good grades. By his side was a copy of ""Final Exit"". I wonder how many depressed people read this book and took their lives."
1,HORRIBLE--TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought the Balboa Chaise, corner chair and chair and ottoman for my deck last spring. This should definitely be marked as indoor furniture. The cushions are completely ruined. I put them on my deck and after a month or so they began to get stained and started growing mildew. I called Amazon and they sent replacement cushions. I then put the new ones on and what do you know, the same thing happened again. They covers are next to impossible to get off to even try and bleach and wash. I am really disappointed and angry that I wasted over $1000 on the patio furniture. I will never make that mistake again. I am now on the search of cushions at other stores that will fit this collection....BUYERS BEWARE. Make sure that if you buy this, you have it in a covered patio, gazebo, sunroom or something were the rain will not get to it."
1,Never got a single isse,Still haven't received a single issue. Don't throw you money away like I did.
1,Poor Representation,"I believe Ms Doyle made a poor representation of the people of Kodiak, as I had lived there myself for many years and coincidentally, during the very time she writes of. It was a pretty thin veil of so many wonderful people that I know well. Kodiak's people are perhaps a different breed of individual to some but, they are honest, friendly, hard working and helpful. One doesn't make enemies very easily there but I can see that Ms Doyle perhaps left a ""bad taste"" to many. Her bitterness at the sacrifice that the many ""real"" women make daily was apparently one she couldn't cut. And, why use Quilt Shops to sell your book? It is so misleading!"
3,"Complete coverage, tough read","As the title states Mastering RMI does contain all the information necessary to master the subject of RMI. However, the explainations are not as clear as they could be. And, I found the pictoral diagrams to be of little value. If you are looking for a book which simply gives you what you need to use RMI you may be dissapointed. This book provides COMPLETE coverage, including the underpinnings of the technology. While this may be interesting reading it tends to divert attention and time away from the practical aspects of RMI. If your one of those programmers that has the time and desire to explore all the nitty-gritty details of the subject, regardless of their immediate benefit, than you will probably find this book a good read. Otherwise, if you just want to get up-and-running with RMI their are simpler and quicker routes you can take.I hope this helpes :)"
4,It answered most questions on RMI mailing List,"I have been on RMI mailing list for half a year. This book clearly explained most of the frequently asked questions on the list. I think by reading first half the book, I understood RMI better than the half year I spent on RMI mailing list.I agree that some examples were not given enough explaination, especially non-RMI related codes. E.g, the IdentySocket."
4,MItchell has never disappointed me,I found this to be a nice rugged real that has held up well over time. The drag is very smooth and the bail has a nice strong spring. It is good for lightweight action when you are just looking for a little fun and want to travel light.
3,"amazon doesnt have it in stock,... does anyone?",its goodi can still listen to it...cant give it more than a middle of the road three starsfor semi-obvious reasonsthoughits far from out of printrumor has it theres maybe 150 of them leftand thats after what five years?
1,I wish the publisher had lost this manuscript!,"This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I'm not sure what point the author was trying to make. What he does is present a random assortment of events from the Lewis and Clark expedition interspersed with some extremely sketchy information about Aaron Burr's attempt to create a country out of the Louisiana Territory, and confusing accounts of Zebulon Pike's misadventures.There are much better books about the Lewis and Clark Expedition(""Undaunted Courage"" by Stephen Amborse for instance). There is more (and better written) information on the internet about Aaron Burr and the ""Burr Conspiracy"".I failed to find any humor in this book, just boring, disjointed, fragmented narratives."
5,Wonderful mix of Portuguese and Brazilian music,"It is a bit silly to read 'Debut album' in this page's Editorial review. Sérgio Godinho is one of the most successful and important singer/songwriters of Portugual, and has been so for over 30 years.One of the most amazing combinations of Portuguese melancholy and Brazil's subtle musical spirit is Lisboa Que Amanhece, by Sérgio Godinho and Caetano Veloso, on Sérgio's album O Irmo do Meio (2003).The CD O Irmo do Meio is simply awesome and beautiful, combining the best of Brazil's and Portugual's leading music icons. It consists of original duets, with Caetano, Gabriel O Pensador, Milton Nascimento, Teresa Salgueiro (lead singer of Madredeus), Cl (a wonderful Portuguese pop band), and many more. All surprising and original. Musical paintings of the first kind. Samples of some other tracks can be found here (click the headphone symbols to listen). A top 10 album of the last decade."
4,Nice book,"It's a good starting point when you have no idea how to get the sound you want. Basic, but perfect as reference."
2,"Uh, I don't think so ...","I read this over several days while commuting to work, so that may have done it a disservice since there are MANY one dimensional characters here. After a the first couple of days, it was hard to keep them straight. That being said, however, my commute reading was not inspiring me to keep reading it AFTER I got home either. This story just kind of sits there. The characters are either stereotypes or paper-thin; you really don't care about most of them. Also, the aggressiveness of taking over this town almost had me routing for the residents.Not much to keep you interested here. And, one more thing, will book publishers please stop putting a naked torso on EVERY gay novel. It's kind of lame and embarressing at the same time!"
2,I just don't get it.,"I can't seem to figure out exactly why everyone is raving about this game. First of all, the graphics are horrible. How could they be so much worse than World Cup 2002?Yes, the game gives you ""complete control"" and is the most realistic around, but I don't think that's necessarily a good thing. You want a game that feels sort of like real soccer and looks realistic, but when I want to play real soccer I go outside with a ball. The point of a game is to be a little bit fantastic. Hence the star powers in World Cup 2002.But the worst thing is just how the game looks. The graphics look great on the EA website, but in actuality the players all run like Gumby, the field appears slanted, and the goals are simply grey boxes. Get World Cup 2002 instead, it may not have the club teams or the 10,000 players, but at least it's fun."
3,"It isnt good, or bad either","Well... The game interface and graphics are just so great, although u might need an ati radeon 9700 or something like it. What makes me give this game 3 out of 5 stars is the teammates AI. It just sucks, I just dont understand why does the opponents always intercept passes, all their passes are well accurate, they shoot on goal every time... But ur teammates just suck they cant even move by themselves. Example: Rivaldo got through my center defences, and the 2 side defenses were there... but u think they went after rivaldo??? NOOO, they stayed at their places... That will make u want to kick your computer and uninstall right away. Isnt worth the $$"
4,It's a Keeper,I would recommend this game to anyone... but I have to say that there's a couple of disappointments i've run into in comparison to previous FIFA Soccer Versions.. in FIFA 2003 I learned that there isn't a Create-A-Player mode in the game which I find disappointing another is gameplay might be too hard for beginners although I'm trying not to be negative this is an awesome game certaintly one of EA Sports best. just those two things disappoint me for some reason but I won't be returning it I'll defenitly enjoy this awesome title !
5,Awesome Iron!!,Last year my old Pizzelle iron that came from my mother bit the dust:( It was actually one that had the non stick coating that being so old I had to oil it frequently during the process. When the wiring died it was trashed. Sure missed it over the holidays and friends did too. I found the amazing one here and I just love it!!! I bought the uncoated one and it works amazing. With the oval shape one needs to elongate the dough instead of a ball. It comes out so nice once you get the shape down. I highly recommend this seller. It even arrived before the scheduled time. A+A+A+A+A+:)A++A
1,Very old fashioned (too much so),Man oh man. The tooling for this thing must be 100 years old. I bought it in Pittsburgh at the urging of the shop clerk. It is just not as good as my Mom's CucinaPro or VillaWare piece (can't remember).
1,Simplistic and poorly written,"I originally saw Ms. Stav on tv and thought that she must know what she's talking about. Since reading her book and others, I've come to the conclusion that she doesn't. Her discussion of investments is particularly shallow and contains numerous inaccuracies. Better books that I've read include Bogle's On Mutual Funds, Random Walk Down Wall Street, Investing and Mutual Funds for Dummies."
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"Having looked at this book, it seems obvious to me that it is basically a marketing strategy that differentiates it from it's ultimate source: Peter Lynch. Stav has culled from the advice of Lynch and some others a method to investing, combined this with her own story, and then written a book in whcih she suggests that this is some sort of ""women's investment strategy,"" trying to make female readers think this method is particularly for them. It isn't. It's just investment advice, and second-hand at that. What this book really proves is that you can put the word ""Woman"" on any book and guarentee yourself a share of the market these days, and that's pretty sad. Read Lynch, instead. Why not go with the orignal?"
1,CANSLIM Through the Author's Eyes,"If Julie Stav's book is an everyday Woman's Guide to Striking it Rich in the Stock Market then William O'Neill's - How to Make Money in Stocks and 24 Lessons for Investment Success must be the man's guide. I was very disappointed that the author did not share with her reader's the Investor's Business Daily newspaper as at least one source for information necessary to complete her BEAPROFIT system. I think she does her readers, male or female, a disservice by not doing so since the majority, if not all, the information necessary to complete her BEAPROFIT system is included in this paper daily. William O'Neill might call this system not BEAPROFIT, but CUINCOURT. This author rivals only Senator Joseph Biden for originality in her work."
5,Best Book for Women who want to understand the market!,Before I read this book I did not know much about how the stock market and mutual funds work. After reading it I was able to understand the concepts and the language of the stock market world. I love the fact that it is easy reading. There are no complicated terms or formulas to understand; it's the perfect book for anyone starting out in this very intimidating world of stocks and funds. I think every one including men and young teens who are interested in understand the stock market would benefit greatly from reading this book first. A lot of knowledge is gain from reading it. I can't wait to read her next book!
5,great type of ball work out,I bought this idem as a gift for my daughter and it has been great. I find with the way that the Ergo body ball is shaped like a capsule instead of a ball you have more stabity and still use the core muscle group. I would recomend this for anyone out there that had tried a ball workout and found the instabity of the ball too much.
3,Not as polished as 'Colour Moving...' but it's still a gem,"This debut offers some hits and misses but that's common for first albums. 'Under These Rocks And Stones' is a preview of the sparkling production and stronger tunes featured on her second album. There are still a number of great songs here even if it doesn't sound like a cohesive album. 'Wayne' and 'Believer' are standouts, and you wouldn't expect a classically trained pianist to sound so sassy and spunky on the latter track, but she pulls it off effortlessly. Good stuff, if you can tolerate some filler."
4,Touching Talent,"I think I first heard one of Chantal's songs on a popular teen tv show. Her songwriting is deep and personal, very moving, songs you can relate to. To me she does stand out from other singers. There is not much drama or glitz around her. I think she is a secret talented songwriter- genuine feelings in the songs. My favorite songs are ""Surrounded"" and ""Imaginary Friend"". This was my favorite album of hers as I also have her others. ""Green Apples"" is a feel good song, very sweet and mellow. Go ahead and get it!"
4,a stand-out debut,"Chantal Kreviazuk is a wonderful talent and this is a smokin' debut. From the well-known opening track on, you'll be hooked to her playing and singing.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
5,Fantastic,"When I first heard her sing at Lilith Fair, I was blown away. I couldn't imagine how good the album would sound when she sounded so great live. I played this cd so much, I wore it out. It is a must have!"
1,Jack is going downhill!,"The first books written by Higgins were excellent. They were realistic and fast paced. Unfortunately he is going downhill fast! The characters are so shallow they are almost cardboard and the plot is foolish. And does any really think that the Secret Service would let anyone in the same building, much less in the same room with the President without going through metal and weapons checks? I'm sorry that Higgins has sunk to the level of writing for money instead of producing good work."
4,Excellent,I love White House Connection. It was suspenseful and exciting. A Bit predictable. But an excellent read. Go out and buy this book.
5,This was so fantastic!,His books just keep coming! Great reading by me and great writing by him! I am up to dATE and can't wait to see what comes my way next! I wish Higgins has a web site! ...the best fiction writing these days!
2,Too General,"The book is much too general to be very helpful. Although it touched on all of the subjects in which I was intereseted, the book provided very few specific guidelines for developing a personal training schedule. The list of possible drills and exercises for speed is limited to basically one page. Additionally, many drills mentioned throughout the text are not fully explained. If you are a beginner (like I am) you will need another source to help build a personal program. You might as well avoid this book altogether. And if you are past the beginner stage, I do not imagine this text will offer much new information."
5,Lovely and helpful sounds.,I recommend this CD. A friend gave it to me and I have since bought several copies to give to others.
5,Hip Hop's Most Versatile DJ Strikes Again,"This is one of Rectangle's finest efforts. Great songs mixed well. If you like hip-hop, you'll love this album. The ultimate mix for a house party!"
5,Grey whale,My grandsons were happy to have this as a way to remember our grey whale watching trip off coast of California at Dana Point.The whale is an exact replica of what we saw in the Pacific Ocean.
5,Replacement.,Purchased this for a replacement of a ten plus year Python siphon. Works great and look like it is genuine manufacture part.
5,Perfect for the Quilt Room,"I ordered 3 packs (6 bins) and am very pleased with them. I ordered them to store folded ""fat quarters"". The bins, though soft-sided, have a firm plastic bottom that holds the entire bin up solid. They are different sizes but I'd read that in the description and knew what I was buying. They will sit on shelves in my quilt room and display my fat quarters beautifully. Great price for a quality product. I'm pleased! A note to quilters - as an added bonus the bins come in very strong, flat plastic bags with snaps -- great WIP bags!"
5,Very pleased with this item.,"We have had this pool set up for 2 weeks so far this year. This is the third year that we have had this pool, and it still works just great. We like it so much that we are getting ready to buy next year's pool by the same manufacturer. After three seasons with this pool, the air leaks from the inflatable ring, but it just requires some daily maintenance, like any other pool.I highly recommend this product."
4,"do not buy the edition with ""Extra Tracks"" - there are none","PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not buy the ""EXTRA TRACKS - IMPORT"" version of this CD. As you can see there are no extra tracks."
3,GREAT LESBIAN ... FARCE,"Meryl Hemmingway seems just right for this role. Her scenes with Renne Humphrey (Didi) are great fun. although the lesbian scenes were hardly explicit. Renne can be seen playing a seventeen year old (she was nineteen at the time) in ""Jailbait,"" a pretty good picture.Mike Binder does a great job as the befuddled husband. There is a great no cuts scene with him and Meryl.Catch the dance scene shown with the closing credits with Meryl shaking her booty."
3,It's alive!! It's alive!!!,"Mike Binder directs and stars in this amusing comedy about a ordinary married man who wants to experience new things with his wife, Mariel Hemingway (Tv's L.A. Law, Bad Moon), in the sex categorie. So the 2 have a threesome (menagetrois) and soon after Binder's wife cant get enough of it and he finds out he has created a sex monster. The cast is great, especially Hemingway in a role she hasnt played before. Binder is so enjoyable you forget the stupid stuff and your just watching him bumble away which gives the movie its energy juice. Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects, Spiders Web) has a supporting role as one of Binder's friends and Melissa Crider (A Boy Called Hate, Frailty) also stars as one of Hemingway's sexual partners. A guilty pleasure in some aspects. The highlights would have to be when Binder, his wife and the 3rd company are having she, so he leaves the room when he cant take the sex no more."
2,Good for price but small size is not true gauge,"8 gauge would be a stretch for this wire!! maybe the diameter of the insulation would be 8 gauge if the entire insulation was made out of copper as well, either way I used the power wire for my speakers, which is nice cause it makes for good speaker wire, you can still wire a car or truck with it (and the size makes hiding it easier) but it is not a high quality wire for competition like set up, unless you use the stuff for speaker wire, then its cool, plus you get some nifty extras like zip ties and rca's excellent purchase for low budget installs."
4,These are cool,These are ok and DO NOT spill/leak if you put the cap on correctly. Your child has to know how to suck to get the fluid out. They are great for training toddlers to use a regular cup.
5,NUBY cups,"My family loves this cup. I have about 8 of them for my two boys (ages 2.5 and 15 months) I have never had one leak, out the side or the top!! they are about $1.50 at walmart. I also love that they stack together and you can use any lid for any cup."
3,"More, Please!","I agree that this is indeed a very nice starter package. A follow-up DVD should definitely include the characters mentioned by other reviewers, but don't forget to also include Wally Gator, another great Daws Butler vocal creation. Oh, fuddle-dee-doo!"
4,Well crafted 'dark' pop.,"Said to be influenced by Duran Duran, Mansun excel at bringing us less straight-forward pop with straight-forward 'hooks'. ""Taxloss"" , ""Wide Open Space"" and the radio friendly ""She Makes Me Sneeze"" are the stand out tracks and the others are great too, this is an album definitely worth buying."
2,very disappointing,After thoroughly playing to death another arty brit pop band (Kula Shaker) I decided to take a chance on another band from the UK. The CD starts allright with The Chad Who Loved Me and Wide Open Space but goes nowhere from there. I am not sure whether Paul Draper wants to be Robert Smith or what but the vocals don't seem to go with the music.If you want Brit Pop try the big boys and take a flyer on Embrace.....do not go here.
5,The best book ever on the explanation of QC,"Easy to read - follow and understand. I plan on keeping this book and adding it to my educational library section. It is right on - about the explanation of Quality Control and why it is so, important to measure-and calibrate with accuracy, in today's business world."
3,Drive in style,"Not a boring show just simple and fast, very much sy-fy channel material. The underwater footage takes the cake, there are few movies with that quality. Plus Patrick Wayne is pretty cool actor I think."
4,Early Silverberg Delivers Adventure,I am a fan of Robert Silverberg but I have to admit I had never even heard of this book. I found it in a $1 used book bin at a local bookstore and immediately purchased it despite it's age and well worn condition.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's very simply written (probably middle school level reading) but it doesn't skimp on the adventure. It doesn't delve deeply into politics (though politics play a part) so it's not offensive to anyone. It's mostly just a nice science fiction adventure that tells the story of a small group of men who meet a series of adventures while trying to travel from the Eastern US to London in a frozen future world.I recommend this book to any Silverberg fan but especially to middle school kids who are interested in science fiction.
2,Does not do justice to songs Gilmour is known for,"Frankly, i was excited to see that there was a book out in publication in David's style. I saw it in a guitar store and was disappointed with the list of songs that you can learn to play. I was hoping that there would be dogs, echoes, pigs on the wing II, wish you were here, shine on, high hopes, Time, Is there anybody out there etc. But the only good song in this book for playing with the guitar is On the Turning away. The other songs are effects pedals ridden. Its hard to play them if you don't have a big pedal board (Well, maybe not Dogs of War). Seriously disappointed. And it is $20!"
3,Very good in parts.,"If you've gotten to the third volume you'll be familiar with the Swann family. This book takes them into the 20th C. and is full of the usual- love, death, Old England coping with Young England, and all very well written. Unfortunately (at least in my viewpoint) this volume goes into great detail on Giles political and parliamentary views, as well as those of David Lloyd George. I'm not very interested in politics, let alone English politics, so these parts bogged down until I began to skip whole chapters. If you're more up in the political atmosphere of the era then you'll get more out of this.I should add that Delderfield seems to assume that the reader has forgotten everything in the previous two books, so he brings up past incidents and characters again and again.All in all, this three book saga could be edited down into one or two terrific books."
4,Good Series,I loved all the books in this series. I got hooked on this family saga with the first book and really enjoyed all the details about life in England during that time frame.
1,Found time to read and wasted it on this book.,"It is hard enough for mother's to find time to read, and for ADD mom's it is not only the time but the attention. I was looking forward to receiving some authentic tools to help me in my daily life. If you are looking for this too, look somewhere else. I found the book very stereotypical. It gave lot's of examples of women who can commiserate about the problems of having ADD, but I do not need to join a club, I need help. Real answers. I was reluctant to read it, after I finished the introduction I was more depressed than before. The inner pages offered no relief."
3,"Good book, but not what I expected","The book seems to focus on mothers of older children and spends very little time on mothers of infants/toddlers. Because of this, most of the book was irrelevent to me. I have earmarked a few pages and will definitely pull it out again once my 2 year old is older."
5,"Finally, a practical book on an important issue","As a psychotherapist who works with many ADHD moms, I *always* recommend this book. This is a warmly written, pragmatic book that will help any mom with ADHD become a more effective parent. The challenges of raising ADD kids are enormous. But being an ADHD mom raising an ADHD (or non-ADD) child can be one daunting and stressful experience. Ms. Adamec calms our nerves and helps us let go of that old notion of the ""not good enough parent"" syndrome. She puts things into perspective- the difficulties we have in raising our challenging children.Best of all, she guides the reader through so many different daily aspects of parenting with very very helpful hints on HOW to do it.I give this book an A +.Terry Matlen, ACSW..."
3,Helpful but too New Agey for me,"What I like about this book--it has excerpts from women, so it tries to capture a variety of psychological worlds. Also, it has questions at the end of each chapter to help you meditate further on the different topics, and the bibliography at the back looks helpful.What I didn't like about this book--it's super New Agey (priestesses talking about rituals, not that there's anything wrong with that... just not my style), and I felt like there was not enough variety in the women interviewed to get a clear view of women's psychology."
5,A good Christmas DVD,THis Naxos DVD has something a little different. The carols and songs have been arrainged by Peter Breinner in the Style offamous baroque composers which lends a new life to some of thesongs. The visuals are quite seasonal and a pleasure to look at.
5,The Classic book on the Energy Grid,"As a fan of Bruce Cathie for many years, I think that this is a good foundation for his work. This book is important because this compilation of his early writtings is updated by Bruce, and explains clears his entire concept of a harmonic light-energy grid around the planet. There is no other book quite like this one. Lots of good diagrams and illustrations. Bruce claims that the British government had his early British publisher destroy all his books in the '70s!"
2,"Warning, these decals will fall off!",These decals look great when you first put them on the tire. I bought 3 and after a few months two have fallen off during normal driving. Possibly try super gluing these to your wheel? I don't feel like these are worth the $11 I paid.
4,easy Chinese cooking,"These NOH spice packs make Chinese cooking easy. The char siu kit tastes pretty good, too. The Amazon price is too expensive, though. These costs a dollar each at my local grocery store."
5,BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ,"Even though this book isn't the most realistic book i've read it's the most entertaining books I've read. I can already see it coming out at the movies one day. I really think it should too. It has all the right elements and plot to become a movie. Right now Steve Zettler is one of my fav. authors but i've only read two of his books (I think that's all his written). The same thing's happening to me with Terrill Lankford, I can only find two of his books. But anyway this book pulls it off and I'm glad to say that's it's my favorite of all-time right now. If something else takes the place of this book in my ""hall of fame"" of books then I'll tell ya'll. Go cop it.~~Special K"
2,Red Tails: A Movie in Search of a Script,"The Tuskegee airmen offer an inspiring, heroic story. Brave men fighting the bigotry many of their own countrymen and the Nazis while armed only with antiquated aircraft. It sounds like the formula for a rousing tale, yet none of this dramatic tension appears on the screen. The dialog is contrived and inappropriate for the period. Military discipline and procedures are very inaccurately portrayed. The plethora of characters are either played as stereotypes or barely developed. From the unit's commander to the the evil enemy fighter pilot, there is no emotional depth to generate the viewer's interest. The flight sequences are occasionally interesting, but also seem fragmented and poorly paced. It is simply hard to generate any lasting enthusiasm for a movie in which the best sight is a P-51 Mustang and the best sound is a Merlin engine."
4,redtails,good movie lots of action and informatiom as to the pastkeeps you watching and not wandering offwould recommend this movie
3,It was ok.,The Tuskegee Airmen from 1995 was a lot better. I didn't feel that the acting was genuine in this movie.[...]
2,Disapointing,To many themes didn't permit proper plot delevelopment. Dialog is simple and disengaged. Character development was absent. Very very disapointing. Would not recomend to anyone... in fact I would like my money and the last two hours of my life back.
3,A Bit Disappointing,"The movie was good but not exceptional. We were a bit disappointed that this was more of a ""love story"" as opposed to the reality of the history that took place."
3,"Alright, but I prefer Tuskegee Airmen","Red Tails contains considerably more special effects, but lacks the depth and quality ofThe Tuskegee Airmen, which I rate a full 5 stars."
4,We fight we fight we fight,"Loved it! This movie told a great although previously told, story of the red tails. I highly recommend this movie for all to see."
1,Didn't finish watching it,"This movie was just awful - bad dialog, bad acting, etc. Last winter I saw a story on TV with George Lucas talking about investing his own money and was excited for this to come out on instant streaming. Then I saw the trailer on TV and it looked a little weak but I still had high hopes. Maybe my expectations were just too high. I was expecting a semi-blockbuster and this felt like a TV movie of the week. I turned it off halfway through the movie so I can't even give this a rating of ""watchable"". Save your money."
3,Good Action,The action sequences for the movie were great. Sometimes the acting was good and other times it was just flat. I would watch it again but Im not sure about adding it to my collection
4,I too saw the movie!,"I know that it was fictional history and the story was marginally at best in the ballpark. But what I did appreciate is the Tuskegee Airmen were remembered and honored. Some of the same issues many of you have expressed with the movie I felt also, such as the outlandish sole combat maneuvers that would never have been tolerated as well as the use of technology that did not even exist back them. But there were the things that did happen, the support of Eleanor Roosevelt, the discrimination at the officers club, and the many combat victories won due to their support and valor. So I hope others will take from this rendition the honor and recognition given to the Tuskegee airmen."
1,waste of time,sucked. story line wasnt what you would expect it to be. it was not historically interesting and you could not even tell who was the hero of the story
2,Below Average,"Don't have anything against African Americans but if your going to tell the story of a time of hardship do it well or don't do it at all. After having watching Saving Private Ryan I realized how poorly done this movie was. Rogue Pilots, a nearly bullet proof fighter squadron, overly used CGI, unconvincing dialogue. Honestly WW2 was a dark time. Thousands died, people starved, entire cities reduced to ashes, death camps...yet we have this movie as if it is a arcade game in the sky...yeah give me a break.Two stars worth renting if you really bored. Good day."
1,PISS POOR QC,"THE BLU-RAY DOESN'T PLAY IF YOUR NOT ON LINE AND THE DVD ONLY PLAYED ON THE PC. MY OTHER DVD PLAYERS DID NOT RECONIZE THE DISK. OK MOVIE BUT NOT WORTH BUYING THE UNUSABLE DISKS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID, TRY RENTING FIRST."
2,Disappointed,"I looked forward to seeing this film. I was disappointed because it did not depict the real history of the Tuskegee airmen in World War II. Instead it is a fictionalized account that is about as accurate to the Tuskegee airmen as MASH was to army field hospitals in the Korean war.It is rife with technical inaccuracies including unbelievably advanced radios on their planes, high explosive machine gun ammunition, cameras on their planes to record their kills and cavalier, free style military tactics that would have resulted in court martials in real life."
2,Clowns at play,"This movie is a insult to the brave men of the Tuskegee airmen. The real warriors were displined flyers whose bravery new no bounds. This movie shows a bunch of rabble who babble. Disregard orders, act like a animal house group. Some flying scenes enjoyable, however movie unbelievable, poor , and lays waiste to any reputation these warriors deserve"
4,preserving history,"This historical event has been a footnote. Thought the story was well told and balanced. Loved ""sticking it to"" the germans and our own bigots."
4,RED TAILS,Great story. Didn't know about it before. I'm curious how historical it is. I would recommend it. Prime movies are fantastic.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was really dissapointed when I watched this movie. A fifth grader could have written a better dialog than what was contained in this so called movie. About the only facts that were true was there was a war called World War II, there were Germans, and there were B-17s, P-51s, and Tuskegee Airmen. The rest was a bunch of made up unrealistic grade school drama."
3,Hollowood,"It was a good story , but hollow wood creations had to over write the true story. Todays teenagers and 20 year olds would go along with the story"
4,The album's afterglow will burn far longer than the film's,"Lush, elegant and wistful is this soundtrack featuring the sax of Charles Lloyd, Geri Allen's piano, Gary Burton on vibes and Sid Page -- remember Dan Hicks & His Hot Licks? - on violin. Long after the film has faded from memory these sounds demand repeated play, on sunless days and times when you need to curl up and disappear into something."
3,afterglow review,"in response to the inquiry about the ""guy with the husky voice"":It is Tom Waits. That is him singing ""Somewhere"" at the end.He is fabulous.The foreign singer remains a mystery to me. If anyone knows who that was...let us all know."
4,Good fun reading,I recommend this book as a good light funny read. Great for a holiday book. The story moves well and is easy reading .
4,Passes the time,A typical Stephanie bond book! Great build up to an exciting ending and then the ending is a bit of a let down. I felt more could of been done to have the reader on the edge of the seat. The story has been written to make you feel like you are there and you care about the characters but the ending really spoils it. So much more could have been done to play out the dramatic ending.The book was a interesting story and certainly worth a read but just don't expect to much.
3,Light but fun,"I enjoyed this escape into Stephanie Bond's Atlanta. It's a city with traffic issues, large businesses, girlfriends, romance, and secrets."
3,Not really for me!,It took a long time to get into book; I like a book that grabs you from the start and this one isn't it.
1,My fault for not reading the desciption carefully,"For some reason ""romantic"" mystery did not register with me. I made it through about one fourth of the book but could not go on. Those who like graphic sex mixed in with their mysteries may enjoy this book, but for those who don't, I would recommend skipping this title. My one star is for the genre more than for the writing."
5,The thinking of the Reichswehr,This book is a compilation of three important books that influenced German operational doctrine in the 1930s. All three are excellent for those interested in the development of military ideas that resonate to this day.
3,Eh?-nvy,"Haven't got the second single, but I can clarify that, not only is Envy a satisfactory product after 2 years of waiting for more Ash material, but the B-Side tracks aren't particularly bad either. 'I Don't Mind' is an uplifting little number, although it does make Tim's vocals sound a little out-of-place at times, and 'Bad Karma Blues' sounded like a misleading path down 'Nu-Clear Sounds' road, with gratuitous swearing and the fabulous lyrics of 'Gonna die of sexual frustration/auto-castration'. Silly, but nonetheless fun, worth around $6 or so"
1,More time to Walk,How can anyone walk 2160 miles and have so little to say about the hike? Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Not what you expect from the cover!,"'Sorely disappointed' best describes my feelings after finishing this book (I almost quit after finishing about 60%, but I kept hoping for something better!). The cover description offers more than the book delivers. Some of the first articles in the book were entertaining, especially to one who lived and worked in Paris for a couple of years. However, the last half of the book is probably of interest only to serious (and elderly) patrons of the arts or to persons who might be practicing for Trivial Pursuit or Jeopardy. Having read the Herald Tribune daily (except Sunday) for 3 years in the early 1990's, I cannot recall having read any of the author's colunmns, which may well be an indication of why I was not enthralled with the collection in the book."
1,QuickBooks Pro - Quick to end support.,"QuickBooks 2001 is no longer supported. I assume that Intuit will drop support at the rate of one edition per year. It is more like leasing the software for 3 years, not buying it. Even the extra cost features became unusable."
3,"OK, but not great","Book is reasonably informative but about half of the book is simply on birthing cattle.....which is a skill that obviously is important, but not something that I expected in this much detail in what I thought would be more of an overview manual. So ended up being more technical and specific that I had hoped."
4,Enjoyable & Encouraging,"This is a really nice CD. Although the playtime is just over a half hour, it's a nice disk to play in the car when you need soothing, encouraging music. The artist has a nice soprano voice and does a lot of duets and trios with herself, which is kind of neat. She kind of sounds like Sandi Patty, only a little tamer. I really like this CD and wish there were more albums by her."
5,nice markers,"we really like these markers. they are great for detail work, and the plastic holder is pretty sturdy and snaps shut for travel. probably better for older kids as the tips fine and not as satisfying for little kids wanting to fill a space with color. my 4 year old likes them, but i think older kids would appreciate them more."
1,Way Over Priced for the Quality!,"I am highly disappointed in this toy. First, when changing it over from a sled to a wagon the pre drilled holes didn't match up. We had to redrill holes ourselves. Then the welds on the handle were in the wrong place and screw used to hold the wagon handle in place didn't work. We had to fix that too. Now one of the wheels keeps falling off because the locking nut is defective. I am so disappointed. These things are all fixable, but for the amount I paid for it, I would expect it to just be right. I don't buy things wanting to redrill holes and find replacement bolts and nuts at the hardware store. I just want it to work."
4,very interesting,Thoughtful and educational. Great library book. Great illustrations and a thoughtful possibility of how it could have came to be. My daughter -6 y.o. really enjoyed it.
2,Is this really a book?,"In all fairness, this book is exactly what it purports to be: 260+ pages of quotes from the man himself, Walt Disney. Today the name ""Disney"" evokes a huge multi-million dollar corporation. I think people forget that Walt Disney was in fact a remarkable human being with some very revolutionary ideas about entertainment. He constantly pushed the envelope and never rested on his laurels. (Don't associate the name Disney with pushing the envelope? Consider this: Disney repeatedly risked bankrupting himself to push his studio and the industry forward... going from black and white to color cartoons, going from shorts to full-length feature cartoons, from cartoons to live-action films, and from films to theme parks. If you've never read a biography of Walt, this isn't a bad resource to get started and find out what the man was made of. But honestly this should have been a day calender, not a book. It just isn't suited to reading as a book."
3,Not entirely essential,"Collecting Strange Tales #101-134 and the Annual #2, Essential Human Torch revolves around some solo adventures of the Fantastic Four member as he goes up against an array of lower tier villains, and naturally has some team up's with Spider-Man, Iceman, and his FF colleague the Thing. Written by Stan Lee, the stories collected here are pretty simplistic, and are a far cry from the stories Lee would weave later on that would make Marvel Comics a force to be reckoned with. Still, with the legendary pencils Jack ""King"" Kirby and his longtime partner, inker Dick Ayers, you can't really go wrong with this Essential collection, even though it isn't entirely essential."
5,This is a faultless movie.,"This is an intelligent, witty, silly, wonderfully cast, beautifully-filmed movie, with a lead female character written as an intelligent grown-up. (No kidding). All performances are top-notch. The music is perfect. The opening credits are high art. It's fun. It's a prize. The bit with the stereopticon is priceless. For all I know, this slice of genius made me see the movie through stereopticon-glasses. I don't care. I love this smovie.Thankfully, I have the VHS tape. Ironically, part of the introductory stuff before the film is a big, flashy announcement about the advent of DVD's. (Trouble is, they don't mention how crappy they are)."
5,Petra Praise 2: We Need Jesus,Petra has come a lone way. They have new players and a new sound. The album has a good mix of rock and great praise music. It is my very favorite of all the Christian CD's I own. Give it a try. You won't be disapointed.
4,Reds Fan Must Have,If you are a true Cincinnati Reds fan or even a Major League Baseball fan you must get this book. It is a biography of a baseball star. The writer didn't just write the book as he saw it he interviewed anyone and everyone that might have had contact with Joe Nuxhall throughout his life and carreer.
2,Enjoyment value is not much - Gets a 1 rating if you're not a Reds' fan,"I grew up watching Joe pitch. Lots of pictures in the book, but it could have been much better written. Not that much about his major league career. Mostly about his life up to making the big leagues. If you're a Reds' fan you may want to read the book, but don't make it a priority or buy the book. If you're not a Reds' fan, don't bother."
5,A great album...all it needs is listeners...,"Marry Me Jane is yet another unheard of group that makes terrific music. Tick has quite a wide variety of music from soft hits like ""Might As Well Be Mine"" to harder stuff like ""Shaking the River."" Amanda Kravatt provides solid lead vocals that are not some Sheryl Crow or other main stream female singer rip-off. Her style and sound are unique, and the flavor of the music is different from main stream pop style. This album is an enjoyable music experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys great music."
4,Great Tombone jazz,"Elegant, effortless; playing off each other the artists provide a great jazz album. Skylark is terrific; an album to sit back with a glass of McCallan, or any other single malt beverage, and enjoy terrific jazz with accomplished musicians. The trombone, like Gerry mullligan's baritone sax, is an elegant instument in the hands of pros like Adler and Wycliff. Enjoy."
2,Beware that program won't suddenly stop!!,"I own an older version of QuickBooks Pro which suddenly stopped and asked me to re-enter my registration number. I had no idea where the old box with the registration number was. A phone call to QuickBooks tech support informed me that QuickBooks can be only run a certain number of times before one has to re-enter the registration code. This was for ""marketing purposes"". They refused to give me my old code as my version was ""no longer supported"". However, when I bought a [costly] upgrade, they suddenly were able to give me a code to let me use my old version...Suddenly stop the customer's software from working, customer cannot recover any data, refuse support, demand an upgrade, then open the software up again.Will newer QuickBooks programs suddenly stop working a few years from now?"
4,A user friendly code book,"A well organized, user friendly code book with extensive figures and tables to help a home designer create a safe and strong home. The loose leaf version allowed me to lay it next to my work and not have to flip it open again and again. Well worth the extra cost."
3,"Flimsy, cheap but adequate","Ordered two of these for the two steps on my new RV trailer. I noticed that after I took them out of their shrink wrap and removed the rigid cardboard inside, the material is cheap, flimsy outdoor carpeting with a few grommets and cheap tension springs to hold it in place. These are a bit overpriced. If you have the means to put grommets in a couple of pieces of outdoor carpeting, then do that. (you can buy grommets at most hardware stores). But, these work just fine. The back of the material is a bit 'sticky' so they don't slip off. They look nice, but buckle in the center on curved steps, like I have. If you're looking for something that is quick and easy, then get these. If you are innovative, make your own."
2,Not good for me,"This rv mat could possibly work good for some but my rv steps are 24"" long and this was too small. Also the material is cheap and thin. It uses springs to attach underneath and those should work fine (I've used those types before). It's very easy to instal. However I removed it and purchased a different brand that I really like that fits. Threw this one away."
3,"Good concept, but inconsistent in its level of difficulty","This might have been two fairly good books. However the two halves do not fit together well.The first section consists of simple drawings, each with a breif explanation of a key aspect of ADHD. This seems pitched at a younger child. The second section is mostly words--it has some fairly useful strategies that studen with AD/HD might use to help cope with inattention and impulsive tendencies.A student old enough to understand the second section might find the first part too childish. A child who liked the pictures in the first part might not have be ble to implement the self-monitoring strategies in the second half.Carol E. Watkins, M.D."
1,what is with you conspiracy people ?,"read some astronaut biographies, go hear some of them giving a talk about their accomplishments, watch the mission films, and learn some basic science and physics so that you dont come across so dumb. talk to the newsmen who covered the missions. you are just plain dumb."
3,Soulful relaxing music,"This was a pretty laid back, jazz kinda, funky hip-hop collection of artist/music. My favorite cuts are Melky & Day's ""I got a love jones for you"", ""Hopeless"" (I love this song), and ""The sweetest thing"" by Lauryn Hill. Larenz Tate's The brother of the night poem is also included in this cd. I have listened to this CD for the past couple of years and I'm not that big on it. I actually was hoping the soundtrack would be as good as the movie."
3,Mixed Blessing!!,"O.K. I have a beef with this CD. It is my assumption that the soundtrack of a movie should be the same as what was released. With that being said, why are their songs on this CD that were not in the movie? It was the same thing with the Bridget Jones' Diary soundtrack, only that CD was worse. I love the tracks by Lauren Hill, Maxwell and Cassandra Wilson. But, if you're going to have us remember the movie, please do your best to have the original soundtracks to the movie and not insert ""fillers"" just to make a CD."
4,It's Fine for What It is,"Give a really fine lawyer a piano, and he very likely will not be able to make music. Give a dynamic entrepreneur a green eye shade, and you probably haven't made him into an accountant.QB Basic tries to help all of us organize our bookeeping so that we can save some of the billable hours for which our accountants are so infamous. In general, Intuit has done a pretty fine job of it, given that the Basic edition is based on the assumption that its users will want a system, not a tool for teaching them accounting. When you have finished the month, quarter, or year, you can turn the results over to the professional so that he can stamp it for approval before you send it to your creditors. You probably will have saved lots of billable hours..."
2,Eagle Claw Reel,"Iem arrived quickly and was as advertised, accept that item didn't reel like it was suppose to reel. The spool didn't go up and down to distribute the line evenly on the spool."
5,V-DoE aka The Analyzer,"To give this album any less than a 4.5 would be an insult to the King (the original King of the South that is). The whole album is nothing but deep issues that are occuring everyday. This has got to be Face best album....next to Untouchable that is. Every track has a differnt message. You can literally listen to this whole album all they way through. If you've never listened to Scarface then you might not understand what he's preaching....but if you've been down since day one.....then you must have this album in your collection. Standout tracks includes #4 Guess Who's Back feat. Jay-Z, and Beanie Siegel, #5 On My Block, #7 What Can I Do feat. Kelly Price (beautiful song), #8 In Between Us feat. Nas, #9 Someday feat Faith Evans, #11 Heaven feat. Kelly Price (another beautiful track). Even the intro and outro are hard. So that's 8 tracks already out of 13. Nuff said!"
4,FACE HAS THE FIX,"scarface is still in the game in full affect with his latest release, ""The fix"" under def jam south recordings. it includes the dope banger on my block and with guest appearances by jayz and beanie sigel and hopefully, face can stick around to bring another dope album"
4,SCARFACE IS BACK!!,"SCARFACE IS AGAIN AT TOP WITH ""THE FIX"" THIS IS ONEOF HIS BEST TO DATE. WITH ONLY 11 TRACKS AS A DOWNFALL ALL OF THEM ARE HOT AND WORTH THE PURCHASESCARFACE FANS COP THIS CD AND EXPERIENCETHE FIX OVER AND OVER AGAINBECAUSE YOU WILL BE KEEPING IT IN REPEAT"
4,The Fix,"What can I say, Face has done it again. If you can't give him his cards on this one, you need to learn how to listen to hip-hop. ""On my block"" is a track that everyone will be able to relate to. It'll take you back to where you grew up, and you'll find yourself smiling and reminiscing about your past. He also has a few tracks with a couple of R&B power houses. Overall, The Fix is a good investment. It contains a little bit of everything you want to hear on an LP. I'v been bumpin it from the time I left the music store."
5,Great Gift,I got this as a gift for my niece and she just loves it. It's perfect for keeping all of her art supplies together and has held up very well.
4,"Big and detailed, but a fast read","Figes pulls off a pretty impressive feat here: he makes a relatively fast and interesting book out of a complex and painful human event. This book gives a good idea of the extremities of brutality, stupidity, and treachery that accompanied the Russian Revolution. It may not please some readers seeking a final, official ""judgment"" of the event, but so what? It tells you what happened and gives some reasons why. That's the purpose of the study of history."
2,If you want to make a career of Hacking Dont read this book,"I bought it expecting to read about ways to have a career in hacking. It was well written, and the forward was good but it made people that want to live comfortably or become wealthy look like scum bags."
3,almost good,"this movie Running Mates doesn't have much story, creativity or originality. the jokes are old and flat and the players are one dimensional and are not very convensing. The story is a persons tale of rising in the ranks within a political party. there is a vague plot to do with the candidates sleeping with his political aide who is coarse and mean to her volunteer staff and is about how hard Tom Sellick (the candidate) works to hide it from the press and his wife. just a bland retelling of the age old war within three's a crowd."
5,"Great product, great seller!",Lock is great - been using it several times a day for over a month and no problems. The seller is also fantastic! I got the lock much sooner than expected.
5,Marvelous,I am a medical transcriptionist for a large company and this book was a lifesaver. Stedman's you rock!! Will buy again.
2,Egos and Guitars,"A G3 concert seems more like a couple of guys showing off in the weightroom then musicians creating music. Satriani, Vai and Johnson try their hardest to get laid, they rip roar and try desperately to speed pick their way into the pants of every girl in the room. In other words, this is heartless guitar heroics without an ounce of musicianship. I'm still not sure how three ""guitar heroes"" could completely miss the vibe of Hendrix's ""Red House"""
1,Don't Bother,We just returned from a month in China and needless to say we shipped this book back stateside. Very disapointed in it Was more like reading some other persons vacation instead of giving helpful tips of where to go and what to see.
1,use lonely planet,based on previous frommers guides I purchased this for my trip to China. I was a budget traveler and found this guide to be useless. Lonely Planet was more expensive and more useful for budget travelers. Thanks Frommer but no thanks from now on. MD Australia
1,Go another way.,"Yes, the ""dots"" are very strong, but positioning of them takes some practice... which would only be a slight problem if they would all work... but almost half of the time they don't dispense at all. And to top it off - if you try to use them on anything thinner than good card stock (e.g. some of the patterned papers), the dots rip the thin paper apart and ruin your project. I wrote the company about it and never got an answer, nor any kind of compensation. Elmer's does some very decent products, but do steer clear of this one."
4,beards,Had a play for church and needed costumes quickly without paying alot. This was great did the job without breaking us financially
4,Another can't miss effort by rectangle,"If you have any affinity whatsoever for hip-hop music, you need a DJ Rectangle CD. This is the first one I ever bought, and while it may be a lesser effort for him (maybe), it certainly solidifies his position as hip-hop's best DJ. Seamless transitions and the best intros on wax. For a party on your stoop, this is the poop!"
2,Disappointing,"While this CD contains a pretty interesting selection of songs from a live performance, the audio quality is so poor that the playback is monotone only from one channel, and not very clear at that. Just not worth the $26.95 price of admission."
2,"Nice, but no sleep.....","Purchased this, along with Rescue, based on reviews. Feels good to rub in, smells nice, but didn't help me sleep."
5,try it,"A friend included this in a little ""Welcome to my home toiletry pack."". I rub a bit on my temples and on my third eye, lay down, close my eyes and i'm asleep! I would not say i normally have trouble sleeping but i keep this product by my bed and use it regularlly because it factually speeds up the process of drifting off to sleep. It's a good product. Thank you, Badger. How's you get so smart?"
4,worth adding to my DVD collection,"I Rented this movie from netflix.com and I liked it alot, wanted to add it to my collection of DVD movies.I went to bestbuy and they didn't have it, went to columbiahouse.com they didn't have it.Then I tried Amazon.com, should've know they'd have it they got almost everything you'd want, next time I'm just gonna log onto amazon .com and check there first."
4,Beautiful painting crappy brush,i love how challenging this painting is!!!! i am almost done but i had to go get a set of brushes because the brush they included doesn't work well. i just ordered 2 more paintings and cant wait for them to be delivered :) The paints that they include are veryyyyy very thin you have to go over 2 to 3 times more to make the number disappear.
5,Wonderful!,"Cats, books and painting -- this must describe someone on your gift list!Of course, it just might describe you. In that case, buy it as a gift for yourself. It's about time you got something nice. And... this is really something nice. For a PBN, the balance, colors -- the entire design is wonderful. If I had seen this completed in a gift shop, I would snatch it up as a gift for several friends who adore the subject matter and have the humor to appreciate the picture.This is another winner from Dimensions, a company that seems to consistently come out with a quality product. Most importantly, they produce PBN's that don't insult the intelligence or aesthetic sensabilities of their target audience -- people looking for a little relaxation and fun with arts and crafts.Recommended."
5,Great product,This product is great. I was going to get a George Foreman grill but didnt want to have to deal with the messy cleanup. The Calphalon Grill is easy to use and easy to clean.
2,Deceiving advertising,The marketing for this pan is deceiving. I thought it was from Caphalon when I ordered it from Amazon. When I got the box it was shipped in a gigantic box with no Caphalon logo engraved on the handle nor the bottom of the pan. I am very disappointed. Now I am going to have to return this darn thing which will waste time and money.
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"I order this sauna suit on may 10 I received my purchase around the 20 I was glad to have finally found a sauna suit that my spouse could fit into so I thought. I got home from work the product came but it didn't look like a XX or XXX my spouse couldn't fit the top or bottom it was just too darn small so I'm thinking this can't be a XX or XXX,if this is the case I think bell should add extra vinyl to their suits or change the size because this is not the correct size, so I'm looking for another sauna suit. Now I must say the Trim belt did fit and it was a XX-XXX"
3,Sized slightly wrong!,"I just bought this vinyl suit, and I must say I am a tad bit disappointed in the size.The top is perfect. When taking the top out of the box you can see it's very big and roomy. I wear a 1-2x in clothing, and I'm wearing the top right now. I have plenty of room to spare in here, and even sitting here typing I'm sweating a bit.The bottom is a different story. The bottom, sized all wrong. My weight is very evenly distributed, and I'm not bottom-heavy or anything. I really wish the bottom was bigger. I tried it on, and couldn't get it past my thighs. The bottom looks very small when you hold it up, especially to be called a 2-3x. I bought this big on purpose. I figured it would last a little longer if I got it bigger. However, the full set doesn't fit properly.The vinyl does seem very sturdy, like you can at least wear it about eight-plus times with care. But it looks like I'll wear just the top. The top is wonderful. The bottom, they need more room in the thigh and rump area."
5,loosing the weight and keeping it off,This is one of the best suits out there on the market and I have tried a lot of them. I have worn my suit multiple times and it last if taken care of correctly. Ones that are available at wal mart tear on the first time worn. These seem to last 9 or 10 times longer. Bell did a wonderful job making these and sizing them correctly. thank you bell sports
5,Crosby and Nash still have it,"David Crosby and Graham Nash still have it. Although their voices are a tad thinner, the 2004 release Crosby and Nash illustrates that they still have a deft touch with lyrics, music and harmonies, with an emphasis on social and spiritual issues. This CD reveals great growth with a jazzy influence from keyboardist Jim Raymond, David Crosby's son and Jeff Pevar, who plays guitar on some cuts. Studio stalwart Dean Parks adds a great amount of talent on the guitar. Jesus in Rio is a standout new cut, with a beautiful, haunting and inspiring theme. It is great to see that the two principals have not only withstood the test of time, but have continuted to display musical growth. Very very worthwhile."
4,amp kit,wire isnt a true gauge bbut it comes with everything to do the job. highly recommended for up to 1000watts
3,Write your Congressman!,"A friend of mine who works for the Department of Education bought me this book after my first trip to DC. I was shocked at how the government sometimes runs. It's true that many of these stories are taken out of context, but it's still an enjoyable (if frustrating) look at government waste. This author has written several books about phenomenally stupid people."
2,Cheap imitation,"Apparently, a film about the Nuremburg Trials was on Alec Baldwin's To-Do list. The sets and costumes are all adequate. The script is mechanical and unimpressive. That is the best I can say about this movie. The real problem may be in comparison to the original film with Spencer Tracy. The original was unique and should have been left that way. If you have not seen the original, you may appreciate this version more so than I. I'm not saying bad, just not to my liking."
5,Let it RAIN,"An excellent piece of work. I collect several varieties of music, with metal being the favorite of all. This album beats out Accident Of Birth, which was also exceptional. He serves up some of the most interesting lyrics in this album. For the people who have the ability to truly understand the lyrical concept of the album, they will find nothing short of exceptional. There is not one bad song on this album. However Book of Thel may give you nightmares."
1,Satanic Garbage,"The music and vocals are amazing. The lyrics sadly are overly Satanic; one song even dedicated to a theme of Satan, even shouting his name. Atheists, agnostics, wiccans, satanists, Bruce worshippers, and others who fool themselves into thinking Satan doesn't exist will likely scoff at this review. So be it. Bruce should use his talent for Christian music."
5,BETTER THAN IRON MAIDEN!,"Outsanding. From the heavy riffs of 'King in Crimson' and 'Killing Floor' to the light riffs of 'Gates Of Urizon' and 'Jerusalem' this album is on a new level of greatness. It's not even a necessity for Bruce Dickinson to yell his voice out the riffs are so great. The best song by far on this album is 'The Book Of Thel' with it's catchy riff and fantastic vocals. Now I order any metal, Iron Maiden or Bruce Dickinson fan to go out and buy this NOW!!!"
2,cheap stuff,Bought this CB a few months back and after hooking it up it worked great.. able to get a few mile range out of it in the city and 5 or so on the open road.. However its now been 3 months and it no longer transmits or receives. Going to contact midland for repairs
4,Iroquois Crafts by Lyford,"As a member of the Oneida Nation, part of the Iroquois confederacy, I am very pleased with this book. The pictures are B & W, but the crafts shown are very traditional. There is also a great section in the back with patterns for outfits and borders. I really recommend it for anyone attempting to make Women's or men's traditional outfits."
4,Makes you want to leave it all behind,"I have taken Chris Brown's Standards Class & thought this book would just reenforce what I learned. It's more story than information which does make it a quick, fun read for me. The guy can get a bit hokey at times but if you can look past that I found quite a few interesting bits that were inspirational."
2,Not a survival kit but survival INFORMATION.,"I have to agree with other reviews I've seen about this item. The title ""Survival Kit"" is very misleading, but anyone with two brain cells to rub together could see it's not a kit.What you get is three waterproof cards with assorted survival info/tips. The floating compass does work if floated in a glass of water but is little more than a gimmick. DON'T trust this as a navigation aid use a real compass!. The only saving grace of the kit is the Fresnel lens this can be used to focus the suns rays on your tinder to start your camp fire and too help read the tiny print on the cards. All of the above is housed in a plastic slip case with room on the back for your name, drug reactions/allergies and your blood group."
5,He gets it right!,"I'm a witch and I love mysteries. So when I came across this book, it was like the Goddess was answering my prayers. This book is entertaining and suspenseful, two things that, in of themselves, makes this a fun read. But in addition to that, this book is very real. Everything from the mundane tasks of Rowan's day, to the decription of low blood sugar from the victim, to the reactions many witches have to endure when speaking of their religion. Sellars does not only a fantastic job of describing the (No pun intended.) elements of Wicca, but of the St. Louis area as well. All of these external cues add to the reality of this story. Blend all of that in with a mystery that keeps you guessing and you have a book you simply can't put down."
4,Realistic Wicca & Really good Plotting,"I enjoyed Mr. Sellar's book quite a lot. His portrayal of Wicca & Wiccan/Pagan practitioners is wonderful, down to earth & realistic. (And it's nice to see witches as the ""good guys"" for a change....)The plot is gripping & Mr. Sellar's has created a core cast of characters that are very engaging.I do feel that you can see some elements of the ""first book"" syndrome, however. Some of the story's plotting seems a little out of place, but aside from that, quite a good read.If you enjoy solid murder mysteries, with a tasty dash of the occult, you should give Rowan Gant's story a read. And then move on to the next books."
5,"Support restorative justice, not the criminalization of poor people and people of color!","In this informative lecture, legendary black liberation activist Angela Davis discusses the frightening growth of the U.S prison industrial complex as a means of silencing political dissent, warehousing the poor, and controlling communities of color. She also talks in depth about prison labor and the role of prisons in the global economy. As this lecture was given at the 1997 Critical Resistance confrence, I am sad to say that things have only gotten worse. If you listen to her speak, you too will be convinced (if you're not already) of the importance of the prison abolition movement. You too will be convinced that the solution to anti-social behavior is not incarceration, but universal healthcare, housing, fair wages, and education."
5,black shoes,great shoegreat price very comfortable and stylist for a bigger shoe doesn't look like a regular old sneaker.My husband loves these and wants them in brown also.for a little ofvariety.what more can we say
1,Propet Village Walkers,"Amazon has misrepresented this product on their web site. It appears there is an option to buy and brown or a brown grain. I ordered the brown grain but received 2 pairs, one that looked liked brown and one that could pass for the picture of brown grain.When I checked with the actual supplier, I learned they did not offer a brown grain. When I further checked with the manufacturer, I found they didn't make a brown grain.Amazon should correct their site to quit misleading customer."
2,shoe dissapointed,"Was disappointed with the quality of the propet shoe, but they did replace it: with the new replacement shoe, the same thing happened: the stitching came out. Did not notify them the second time."
2,These boots weren't made for working.,"These boots, I guess, were not made to be worn everyday for work. After 2 1/2 weeks the footing inserts are falling apart and the leather is splitting. If you want tough work boots don't buy these. These are made just to look good."
4,One of the first great psychological novels,"In 1824, James Hogg published one of the first great psychological novels. The ""Justified Sinner"" is a Scots Calvinist who comes to believe that no action of the elect is a sin. To put it another way, his theology drives him mad.Or does it? He insists that a young gentleman led him into some of the evil he does and that the worst of the actions attributed to him are not performed by him at all. Is the ""Justified Sinner"" mad or has the Devil lured him into sin and even taken on his shape at times? This novel is a forerunner of works like Stevenson, THE STRANGE CASE OF DOCTOR JEKYLL AND MISTER HYDE and of James, THE TURN OF THE SCREW."
4,The Best Band In Canada,"Why shouldn't I like this album? It combines influences from my 2 favorite bands Radiohead (The mood swings and fallsetto vocals of Car Crash and the acoustic intro of Superman's Dead that sounds a lot like the one from Radiohead's Just) and the Smashing Pumpkins (Heavy Guitars, nasal but cool vocals, amazing drummer) as well as actually having the ability to come up with 11 decent songs. This is an excellent Cd and reassures me that there are actually good bands in Canada."
3,Not really as bad as I thought....,"I really thought that this would be like the rest of the senceless BS they play over the radio, but I was quite impressed.... They didn't have the lack of emotion like these teenybopper bands eve6,3EB, or marvelous 3. They actually have a little talent!!! how often does this come along??? not very, if you're a radio listener."
3,"Wrong product, right package","I received the CD case pictured here for 'Clumsy' by Our Lady Peace. When I opened the case I found a CD I am not a big fan of, 'Happiness...Is Not A Fish', also by Our Lady Peace. I called Amazon and was told that I could ship it back for a replacement. I didn't think this a good use of my time for a replacement CD that cost around $3."
4,"great vocals, but nothing like pumpkins","the smashing pumpkins have similar songs but the bassline and drums are completely different. Raine Maida is a great vocalist, and his band members are just as good at what they do. I think OLP has a unique sound that shouldn't be compared to pumpkins or anyone else. And anyone who disses them as radio-friendly pop should try listening to the backstreet boys or N'sync. after listening to that crap they'll realise why OLP has true talent, because NO ONE else on the radio sounds anything like them"
1,"Great music, dreadful remastering on this release","In the Heat of the Night is Benatar's best record, IMHO.But do NOT purchase this CD.The ""remastering"" job done on this release borders on the criminal, in that it doesn't sound appreciably better than the first CD releases.I understand they released another remastered version of these records in 2006. If you're buying these records for the first time, buy the later remasters.As for me, luckily I had the original vinyl versions, which sound 5x better than this mud when I digitized them myself with an $8 adapter from Radio Shack. Still, I wish I had legal recourse for wasting $20 on this CD."
1,Too many cooks...,"Alot of nice things have been said about this dated guide book. So here is one bad thing. This book was written by over 100 different people, each with a different opinion. On one page you will be told not to even think about cheating on your taxes, on another page you are encouraged to hitchhike via a rail car. Too many voices all giving a different point of view, ranging from goody-two-shoes to a free wheelin' slacker. All the tech info is so out of date that it is laughable. The chapter on work offers no advice on preparing a resume or interviews, but they go into great detail about how horrible it is to work for a female boss and how affirmative action makes life not worth living. One second they are telling you not to lie on your resume, the next page they are telling you how to bribe a cop. If you think that ""The Man Show"" was the greatest TV show ever, or if you watch professional wrestling, than this book is for you."
5,"Tap dancer's ""national anthem""",It's easy and it's fun. Must have for every tap dancer. I have all of Rusty's tap videos and all are excellent !!
4,Three minor poets,"Dipping into this volume, sampling the poems of the three poets whose work is given here I sought to find memorable and moving lines- sought to feel that what I was hearing was ' true poetry- the poetry of the chill down the spine, or the poetry that breaks through the icy-sea within, or the poetry that makes one feel enhanced in some deep way-poetry of beauty and music- poetry of love.I did not , perhaps because of my own limitations as a reader, find that kind of poetry in these lines.Amis is ironic, swift and humorous.Moraes seems to me more self- seeking mystical.Porter touches with thoughtfulness on great and horrible events .Each of the poets is to be respected.Each can be read and heard.But when I read the poetry I love I always strive to remember some part of it.And of what I have read in this work I do not remember a line."
4,Home is Where the Habitat is.,"I'd reccomend this book to anyone wishing to construct homes to attract wildlife and enhance habitat. It is comprehensive with respect to species which nest on platforms and in boxes, and the plans are consise and easy to follow. There are also alternate designs for some species, based on how detailed you wish the construction. I have referenced this book several times over my years owning it, and the 7 or 8 pairs of wood ducks that return to my pond every spring are testament enough."
5,Great Work!,"I bought this cd at a store called Hot Topic when I was buying a NOFX shirt. I hadn't heard of ""The Decline"" yet but the guy there said it was really good. So I bought it and when I first listened to it I thought Ok, this is wierd but then I listened to it again and I loved it! The lyrics are deep and true, and the music is top notch, with some great gutair and trombone work in the backround. The price is a little high for one song, but it is well worth it. You'll love this cd if you like punk or not, just give it a chance."
5,It's popular - so what!,Still it's a masterpiece these guys have created with 'The Decline'. One song that one can't stop listening to because it probably is the best punk-rock song that has ever been created. Thanks a lot for this song!
5,The best punk song ever,"NOFX is none too impressed with stupidity. That's kind of the subject of the The Decline. It's one 18 minute long punk rock song. Actually, it doesn't sound like that. It's more like 8 or 9 punk rock songs morphed into one gigantic 18 minute long song. The subject matter of the song is their views on politics, social aspects, and a view of society. The music is really catchy and the lyrics are great. I've listened to it several times since I've purchased it. NOFX is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands as well as one of my favorite punk bands. This is different from anything I've heard. If you think that nothing good has ever come out of punk rock, you must give this at least one listen."
5,Buy It!!,"Man, this is one heeluva song. If you are bored or want to spend a couple of weeks with just one song blasting, this is the one!! The one track cd gives you 18 minutes of pure NOFX bliss and tells a fast-paced story of their view on politics and the decline of society. If you're into that, good, if you are not, who cares, the music will take you away with drums blaring, guitars riffing, trumpets hooting and Fat Mike's bass strumming - add to that his vocals Eric's stunning backup screaming and you've got a song which you probably won't get bored of until you've listened to it over 50-70 times - Honest!! It is just one of thos things that you've gotta keep coming back for more. If you've got a spare tenner lying round, don't spend it on hot dogs, don't spend it on your girlfriend, don't spend it on your car - spend it on The Decline, one of NOFX's finest creations."
4,The Fall of Le Maison Fontfroide,"Orphaned at 12, Elizabeth flees her three dismal aunts and is taken into a stranger's family home. At 16, she must depart for a remote old manor: Fontfroide, decaying and in financial straits. Blessed with beauty, she nonetheless is so toughened by her past that she has the courage to explore the dark interiors and, one by one, encounters the ten other ""guests."" She doesn't realize that, like the others, she in all her youth is being enmeshed in a spider web.Finally, one night she stumbles upon a sleeping figure, a rough-hewn but handsome youth. When awake, Serge eventually arouses in Elizabeth that sudden flowering of love, flesh, and death-defying obedience. They must leave this prison, Fontfroide!In 2010, the reader may find the ""house of mystery"" theme in this 1936 novel overfamiliar, and the 16-year-old girl lacking complexity. But Green's deft interlacing of details, as always, engrosses.The dramatic climax is not (or is?) to be believed."
5,"Excellent, exciting new voices in country","The Kinleys are fresh new voices in country music. Each of the Kinleys, Heather and Jennifer, have beautiful voices...but what's really amazing is the harmonies they create together. The songs on the CD range from folk-like guitar ballads to country-rock ""blast it as you drive through town"" tunes. If you love country, especially the new wave of women artists, this CD is for you. If you are into other types of ""girls with guitars"" music, such as the Indigo Girls and Nanci Griffith, you should check this CD out..I think you'll love it."
5,superb blade,"The best circular saw blade I've used: fast, smooth cuts in a variety of woods and OSB. Highly recommended."
3,ok,"After all the great reviews, my expectations were quite high. My son is 4 years old and enjoys other building toys so I thought this would be great for him, however he continues to use Trio mostly. I think he finds Mobilo too complicated to work and it does not construct the type of things he wants to make. He occasionally pulls it out and then puts it back soon after. I would not purchase it again."
5,A beautiful Japanese Fashion Doll (Jenny is the Japanese Barbie),"I bought this doll in 2006, and still have her on display in my toy room. She is gorgeous.The doll comes with a couple of different outfits, and she does not have pink hair (she has brown hair). The pink hair is a wig. Unfortunately, the wig does not really look that great on the doll (it does not cover up her brown hair completely). Luckily, she still looks beautiful with out the wig. (And one of my Barbies with hair problems happily took the wig for herself ^_^).For the hard-core Fashion Doll Collector: If you can find one of these dolls, at a reasonable price (and intact in box), I'd suggest you grab it while you can.>^..^<"
4,its awesome,"a reely good ska album. If you like reel big fish, mustard plug, the hippos, all those others you will like this cd."
5,Great Product,"I have had this exact crusher for 15 years. It is mounted on the side of my shed in the backyard. It is exposed to the elements but in spite of it's years of abuse works extremely well. I thought by now the hinges or handle would wear out but it shows almost no wear. My family drinks lots of canned soda (about 5 a day) so I get lots of use out of this. I have crushed thousands of cans over the years and it still works like new. The only issue is that sometimes a can will pop out not completely crushed, the fix for this is to pinch in the sides of the can as you load it. If you do that the can should stay in place. Great product!"
5,Love Crushing Cans!,"We wanted a can crusher because in CA you have to pay a deposit on all cans and glass bottles...This helps reduce the space in the trash so we can fit more... I thought that it was going to rip off my wall when I assembled, but I found a stud, drilled it in and wham...works wonderfully... Glad that I got this!"
4,can crusher,works great but you do have to be careful or the can will come out at you. has the potential to pinch your fingers recommend you wear a pair of gloves while using this product because of the sharp edges on some of the cans.
5,Very nice metal can squasher,I wanted a can crusher that I could operate easily. This fit the bill. It is metal but the handle is cushioned with foam. It easily mashes our aluminum cans. I've positioned a bag-lined bucket right below where it is installed on the wall. When the can is mashed it can drop right into the bucket. Once the bucket/bag is full all I have to do is tie it up and put it out for the recyclers. This is SO much better than the old way (I used to step on the cans to mash them flat.)I'm really glad I chose this crusher.Denise
4,"rugged, does what it's suppossed to","This product is very helpful in reducing the physical size of the contents in your probably too small recycle bin. It's rugged and is easy to use. I would recommend that it only be mounted onto wall studs though, otherwise you will br repairing walls after only a few uses."
2,No Durability,"This can Crusher worked awesome at first. After about a month I had to take it apart and reinforce the piston assembly. This Crusher looks great, but it needs to be made of thicker/better steel."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I've been using a flimsy can crusher for years where the bottom plate pivoted down when used. I wanted a beefy crusher, and this one is indeed beefy, but where it fails is that it has lots of metal to metal surfaces with no lubrication. It takes a lot of effort just to close it even without a can. The instructions say to lubricate it with household oil. I tried that, then silicone spray, then mechanics grease, and it is still harder to operate than my old crusher. If they added some bearings or plastic spacers it would be just what I wanted."
4,"Good, but ultimately not perfect","I'm looking for another one of these, nothing else seems to be anything like the quality and durability. We have two, one upstairs and one downstairs... in our office building. After several years they have both broken. One has worn completely through one side of the pivot and the other has cut through the back where the bearing surfaces of the crusher plate uprights stop the crusher plate from folding over. We've worn about a 15 degreee angle on these parts.But we crush probably 100 cans a day, and this was looking pretty worn nearly two years ago when I joined the company. So another 40,000 cans have worn it to the point where it sometimes jams and sometimes kicks cans out the front, but it's still working."
5,BEST CAN CRUSHER ON THE MARKET,THIS IS THE BEST CAN CRUSHER ON THE MARKET. I BOUGHT ONE AT OUTLET MALL MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO AND IT IS STILL GOING STRONG. I FOUND THEM AT AMAZON AND 3 OF MY FRINDS WANTED ONE TOO.
5,Great Product,This product works great. It is very sturdy and I believe it will be around for a long time.
1,"Very disappointed, poor quality","I bought this unit because of the great features and the Polariod name...well, I have learned my lesson. I watched one movie on it on the way to the airport. Once we got on the plane and I turned it on, the screen lit up, but the disc would not spin. Checked the unit when I got home, the battery was fully charged and the player still wouldn't work plugged into direct power...I will be returning this and buying a new one, and not a Polariod."
5,Brilliant.,"The album is a must have for any music fan.On one hand there is the soft,romantic ""TRULY MADLY DEEPLY"",on the other is the rocking ""BRAKE ME SHAKE ME"".""TO THE MOON AND BACK"" is simply awesome.Very good indeed."
3,I like Darren Hayes,"Darren was the only reason why I bought this CD. I also like ""Truly Madly Deeply""."
1,Derivative Junk,"I am so sick of ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" I want to break the radio everytime I hear it. Blah! This is the most unoriginal, cheesy music I've ever heard. I'm just glad they're so talentless, at least they'll go out of style soon."
5,I loved it!!!!,"Truly Madly Deeply is just about my favorite song. I loved this cd. I cry every time i hear Truly Madly Deeply, cuz it carries great memories."
5,Melodious Heaven!,"This album is a wonderful mix of upbeat tunes and fall-in-love sweetness. From ""I want You"" to ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"", nothing in this album is a snore. Can't wait for the next album. I have played it so much, my cd has grooves in it already! ;)"
5,Savage Garden RULES!!!,"This CD is soooooooooo cool! I fell in love with Truly Madly Deeply the first time I heard it on the radio. To The Moon And Back is really cool, too. Hey, all you total Savage Garden fans out there, go to http://www.savagegarden.com/Sound/[insert your favorite song title here].ram The song title should be one word with capitals on the beginning of each word; ToTheMoonAndBack, IWantYou, TrulyMadlyDeeply, etc. It is sooooo cool!"
4,Great CD! Not a nessecary must though....,"This CD is really good. All the famous songs, of course, are wonderful. ""Santa Monica"" , ""Break Me Shake Me"", ""Universe"", and ""Tears of Pearls"" are pretty decent also. But the rest...aren't that hot. Let's just put it that way. So, all in all, get this CD if you love the other SG songs on the Radio!"
4,"Good, not great...",It's Philip Glass- so your expecting repetitiveness. But this can be a bit too much. It's no Koyaanisqatsi (his best work IMO) but this foray into minimalist synth compositions is still a fun distraction.
2,Frye didn't meet its mark,"Not quite the quality I was expecting from Frye. After wearing for only 2 days, the heal on the left boot was separating from the leather. These boots also seem to run quite small. Amazon was great with the return process!"
5,These BOOTS are amazing!,"When I first time I tried them on, they slid perfectly into place and it was kind of dis comfortable at first because I wasn't use to wear a high boot. Now, I walked into them and I absolutely love them. They are amazing! You could wear any color type of jeans except for neon colors doesn't go well. You can tuck them in or you don't , wear a western shirt or a nice fitted dress shirt. I would also recommend the Gaucho colors, you get plenty of attention with those too."
4,Party crasher review,Enjoyed this book very much. It was quite entertaining. The plot was well written and I had no idea who did it l would highly recommend this book.
2,Silly and juvenile,I am a serious reader and desire a plot that unfolds. There really was no plot here. A juvenile romance story.
4,Stephanie Bond - good reads,"Stephanie Bond's murder mysteries are a fun read. Good plot twists, easy to pick up, put down, then pick up again and quickly step right back into the action. I read this prequel after reading the Body Mover series. Some of Bond's other writings are worth your time as well."
4,Party crashes,"Good book loved it need more books like it. A lot of suspense and love. Will recommend to my friends,"
3,Not much romance,"Overall the story was good, but the romantic relationship evolved rather quickly without much planning or development. This book was better than most of her's."
5,Nail Biter,Very good book. Fast paced and never dull. I didn't know what to expect next. Many twists and turns. I highly recommend this book.
3,A fun read,The main character was funny and easy to relate to. The other characters were quirky and interesting. The ending is a little sappy and predictable. But overall enjoyed this book!
4,Party crashes,"2nd book I have read from you and I will being going to a third, and with my belief in family I think I will be able to find a few selections. And you were right that I would do anything to protect my sister's, even move a body so that will be my first selection. Thank you and keep writing."
2,same thing in every book!!,same kind of story in every book!! 3 women one gets a guy. i am so done reading Bonds books. not enough mystery for me!!
4,It is what it is - A code you have to follow.,Had no problem with the order - very efficient and the book was in excellent condition. Thank-you for making this so easy.
2,one size does not fit all,"said x-large. very dissapointed in size. this by no means is x large, maybe x small. would get next size up"
4,Brutal honesty?,"Guggenheim doesn't seem to gilt her ""Confessions"" in velvet (or gold); she comes across as an honest soul wanting to relate her experiences--an influences--in the art world. Some of the things mentioned are her childhood, her marriages, Max Ernst, Brancusi, Kandinsky, Pollock, and Motherwell (to name but a few). Worth a read... and another read."
4,"Helpful, easy to read","This book was easy to read and the ideas are presented clearly. The content is not so different from other books on codependence but his nice lists of ""common problems of codependents"" and rules of dysfunctional families, e.g., make it quite accessible and an easy read. My only complaint was some (in my opinion) unnecessary foul language. I am not easily offended and that isn't my objection. It just seemed jarring in the context of a serious, yet entertaining, self-help book to have 4-letter words sprinkled throughout for no apparent reason. For me, this really detracted from its message.I'm not talking about graphic sex or anything like that - primarily exclamations, as in: ""Oh xxxxx!"" If you will be totally distracted or offended by this, then pick a different book. If this won't bother you, then I think it's a worthwhile read in spite of the questionable language."
