1,Clearly defective product - BEWARE!,"Yes, the unit works as advertised, but as many reviewers have outlined here, the units are short-lived. I have had my second set stop working and have asked D-Link for my money back instead of a third defective set. They seem to last 1-2 months before they stop working, and if you search the web you will find that most people that purchase this kit have the same experience. The main problem is that D-Link's customer service is terrible - it is difficult explaining the problem to their call centre staff and getting the first replacement kit was a miserable ordeal. They also deny that anyone else has had this problem and seem to be oblivious to these Amazon reviews.Do yourself a favour and stay away from this product."
1,time and money waster,"I've purchased 2 pairs to replace the wireless network connection for my ReplayTVs. At this point, I've had 5 units burn out on me within a year's span. I've tested my outlets and am quite satisfied that it's not a problem with my wiring. Given reviews I've read from others who have purchased this product, it would appear I'm not alone.3 RMAs and 1 store return later, I'm extremely disappointed in D-Link that they would continue to manufacture and sell such an inferior product, especially given the high price. I generally love them and their products, but this one is the pits. To be clear, when the units work, I get phenomenal speed. However, that's fairly meaningless given all the downtime the network has had while my RMAs are processed."
1,1 star for working great for 1 month,"Stay away from this product. It works only for a month.- gets really hot. Not good for little kids. Potential fire hazard.- gets frequent interference, i.e. washer, hair dryer, vac cleaner.- notorius for having a very short MTBF/product lifespan.- now if you cannot return it, its does not make a really attractive piece of useless furniture."
4,New fan likes what he hears,"This album was given to me by an ardent French fan and it is the first time I have heard him. One or two of the songs are weird pastiches, but most of the album is great to listen to. I especially like Daho's method of non-singing- he sings with such ease that he's almost not trying. This album is worth investigation."
5,lush,"This is a beautiful album. Daho's breathy baritone is almost comically stereotypical, but it contributes to a wonderfully exotic feel. The songs and arrangements are superb, and for 1996 (when it was recorded) bang up to date. On several tracks, especially the housey ""rendez-vous au jardin des plaisirs"", the sound is prescient of Madonna's recent work with William Orbit. Set sail for this Eden."
1,Terrible!,"Totally disappointed with this one! The photography is not IMAX quality, and the narration is terrible--entirely devoid of educational content and many words were mispronounced!"
1,Disappointing!,"Also waited 3 months for this DVD to be delivered. Agree totally with prior low reviewers. Color is terrible, smudges evident, timing of narrative vs scene out of whack, and the worst narrator ever. Completely distracting to hear the narrator's mispronunciations. How about ""ANENEMY"" for sea anemone numerous times!!! Fish collecting in ""SHOALS"" for protection (thought the word was ""school""). Surgeon fish having tails resembling a scapel ( was that supposed to be scalpel?)Don't buy this one - amateurish, insulting to anyone's intelligence. Simply not worth it!"
5,cured,"at the age of 32 i sprained my neck, which took me to a path of my 3 most miserable years of my life. going to the chiroprator, and many other doctors only led me to near suicide. i was told that i had a herneated disc and that i would never be able to ride a bike or run, or do anything strenous forever. the book made realized that i am bringing the pain to myself. the pain was in my neck, and on the inside of my shoudlerblade. it was unbearable most of the time. if it wasnt for my daughter, i would have probably given up on life. i can now actually realize how it works. its so simple...i can even cause the pain in the same places. all i have to do is tense my muscles. if i do get pain, all i do is relax the muscles. its such common sense. i am now lifting weights heavier than i did when i was 20. read the book...and your life is going to change."
2,Mind Over Back Pain,The format and style of this book make it a slow read for me. Topically it may be fine but it is not otherwise appealing.
2,"Cute design, but dog hated it","We thought the sunglasses looked very cute, but our dog did not think so. He's a maltese (longer hair/fur), so his fur would get stuck inside the glasses and in front of his eyes."
4,The Eastern part of the Church at Vatican II,2005 was the 40th anniversary of the ending of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). This book adds to the remembrance of that great Council. Fr. Saba has provided to the world a great source for what the Melkites gave to the Church at the Council. They kept the Church from forgetting the Eastern part of the Catholic Church. Fr. Saba gives the history of the Melkites in summary form and then provides the history of their theology. He then provides the history of the participation of the Melkite prelates in Vatican II. They spoke up for the Eastern Church. They were also hoping to be a bridge between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. If you are interested in the Eastern Catholic Churchs here is a good one to read!
5,Outstanding,"When I was 11 y/o I found a copy of Burn Witch Burn and it captivated me. I couldn't put it down. BWB was the first book that I had ever encountered that would let me alone. I didn't want to eat dinner or go outside and play, I just wanted to read the book. Now many thousands of books later, I was curious it I would have a similar effect on me and it has. No BWB is not Tolstoy but that being said it doesn't try to be. It is however an exceptionally wonderful plunge into the macabre. The characters are interesting and the plot is outstanding. Merritt was one of the first writers to integrate the new science of psychoanalysis into his work. He, like many writers of his day, mistakenly uses the word 'subconscious' rather than 'unconscious' when describing hidden motives and trying to understanding a characters deeper pathologies. But he does it so well that it is a mere bump in the road. I recommend BWB highly. Now I want to find a dime store copy."
2,A flawed movie,Very disappointing. Spoilers>> Malkovich claimed he could not say when exactly someone will die but he knew they were going to die (we all can predict this). But when the guy on the tube shot himself he said he was going to die within 2 hours (did it mean that when they glowed white they had 2 more hours?). So how soon was Clair going to die after she glowed. It was all pointless as the Messengers had no power to stop death only to predict that someone was going to die at sometime.
4,Worth reading,"We have read about three or four of the books in this series. This one is by far the best. Drew Bledsoe does a great job teaching kids about integrity. My son, who is a Patriots fan and student of the game of football, really enjoyed this book. As a parent, I loved the message. This book doesn't just play lip service to the message ""make the right call."" Bledsoe really seems to live it. Highly recommended."
5,The Final Countdown (Two-Disc Limited Edition),The movie was sure blast from the past. This one gets lent to family and friends more than any other one I have.
3,The Outer Limits,"Provocative pondering aside, taken as is, this is a pretty fair action flick. However, taken as a pure sci-fi flick, it doesn't go beyond the premise it proposes. You have to do more than just suggest, you have to commit to a position then go with it. It's easy to say, ""what if"", more difficult to follow through and present the repercussions of your theory. I would rather have seen a more complete story, but I can only deal with what they came up with; there's still enough potential here to satisfy.Kirk Douglas, James Farentino, and Katharine Ross are quite good in their roles. Charles Durning was a bit off but I put that down to the writing that made his senator more thug than politician (or maybe it's the same thing?).I've seen this movie a couple of times, probably won't watch it again, so it's not a keeper."
5,Good Movie,This is a good movie. I bought it for my husband for Christmas as a stocking stuffer and he enjoys it.
1,Complete disappointment,"This movie started with the perfect set up. A modern war machine with a well trained crew, transported back in time in full working order the day before Perl Harbor. You get the satisfaction of watching 1980's US Navy fighter jets embarrass 2 old style Japanese fighters. You have this huge build up to an epic defeat of the Japanese fleet to a lone future aircraft carrier crew preventing one of the greatest defeats in our countries history. But no. Magic storm shows back up and sucks them away. You get teased with the epic battle almost from the very beginning of the film. I don't care about potential problems with the time line! It's like Rocky with no title fight. It's like the Chronicles of Narnia where Aslan doesn't show up. It's like Star Wars where Luke decides to skip out on the assault on the Death Star. You get built up hoping to see this and then ""No battle for you!"" A complete tease and no satisfaction."
1,seller sucks!,"this seller sent me a german copy instead of an american copy. I ordered it on 12/4 for a christmas gift & did not recieve the order til 12/30. then I had to return it, because its GERMAN. I sent it back on 1/4, they recieved it on 1/11... today is 1/30 & they are STILL saying they have not processed it back into their system. it can take up to 6 weeks.WHATEVER.... trust me, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS GUY!!!"
5,"One of the top 5 ""What If?"" movies",A great time-travel what would happen if movie. First-rate production and story line. Well worth the cost.
4,Interesting and overlooked,"Finally was able to get a good copy on DVD after watching a substandard VHS tape for years. If you are into science fiction at all, this is quite a yarn. Will stretch credibility a bit but the great acting and scenes on the aircraft carrier Nimitz more than make up for it. The ending is not to be missed or disclosed."
5,Classic for avaition fans,"Saw it in the theatre first run back in the day. As enjoyable now as it was then. Awesome A-7, F-14 and other aircraft footage. They did a nice job remastering the film too."
4,Good adventure,This is a good not great movie that was well paced and enjoyable. A good cast with a different take on adventure sci-fi movies.
5,Great rag....,I ordered on the 5 of the month and recieved my first copy less than a month later.This is the quickest i have ever received a publication ever.Also the quality of the rag is unbelievable. It is a must buy for anyone who is a serious Salty fly fisherman.
5,Excellent Magazine,"For those of us who enjoy fly fishing in salt water, it doesn't get much better than this magazine. The articles encompass a wide geography, particularly in the U.S., and a wide variety of species. I particularly appreciate the excellent and educational content concerning flats species like bonefish, tarpon, and permit."
1,yuck,"What a disappointing waste of money. My copy came today and it will go to the Goodwill tomorrow. I found nothing but drab, useless projects in this book. Not one single thing I would ever want to make."
4,"Works well, but definitely not as well as a TiVo","For all I bought this for, to use my 30"" Apple Cinema HD Display as a ""TV monitor"" using the cablebox and TiVo as the tuners, it works quite well...If you want to build your own TiVo, running on OS X, then it fails completely. I have used it as a basic cable tuner, and it works fine, though the on-screen navigation is pathetically illogical, as well is the remotes navigation controls, which make no sense, especially given the remote's simple design.I have had a couple problems with the EyeTV software muting the audio randomly on it's own, and it has occasionally locked up entirely, where the only fix is to force quit EyeTV, then log out and back in."
1,Be Careful,"The product works in Canada except for the program listings useful for scheduling recordings, but you should be aware that the Eyetv Hybrid model on offer as being ""new"" was not the latest version (purchased Feb.29). It did not have the version 3 software, nor was it the latest hardware release with QAM. Amazon should have made this clear. I have decided not to return it as I don't need the QAM feature and the version 3 software can be obtained from the elgato site after a bit of hassle. Just be careful that you get what you want."
2,disappointed,"I am using the TV Hybrid on a Dual processor Power Mac with 4 gB of RAM and an Apple 17"" LCD Studio display. The picture is somewhat blurred and/or stutters during action sequences such as basketball games. The sound is just slightly out of synch with the picture , as well, which is a bit annoying. I downloaded the latest EyeTV 3 software and now can no longer receive the over-the-air digital ASTC stations. Reverting to EyeTV 2.5.2 allows the stations to be received again. Support is available but only via email and takes several days to get a response which has, so far, not resolved my issues. At this point I would consider the TV Hybrid as an emergency back-up."
5,Works!,"Works well, eyetv 3 software with newer units is reasonable. Unit gets a bit hot after a while though."
3,So-So,This is a good magazine not the best. I like transcriptions but doesnt have them. The gear reviews are good it helped me buy an effect station. Overall I give it a three.P.S. I think Brandon was talking about guitar one. I know that has a riff box.
2,NOT the mag it was. But still worth [$$$] a year.,"Guitar Player has lost most of it's depth and scopein hopes of attracting the short attention span MTV crowd.And that is a shame.The poor editorial staff are trying so hard to beglib and ""street"" that most of the time it's justembarrassingly juvenile.Also it should be printed in Korean because 85 percent ofthe guitars they review are over hyped junk with NO resale valuefrom that wonderful land."
1,Too narrow...,"When I read a magazine, I want it to present different styles of guitar. I want it to teach me new things as well as introduce and review new gear. Guitar Player mag just doesn't cut it. It is a magazine based almost exclusively on rock. It's fine if you're a rock musician but what about the rest of us guitar players (jazz, blues, country, classical, flamenco)? The product reviews are OK but leave much to be desired. In my opinion, this magazine's perspective is too narrow. The guitar has so much to it and this magazine just doesn't show it well.PS- I've been playing guitar for 21 years (gospel, jazz, fusion, latin). Personally, Guitar One mag is one hundred times better than this magazine."
4,"Not the perfect guitar magazine, but better than Guitar One","I think that this is a much superior magazine to Guitar One because wheras Guitar One almost exclusively writes about the latest nu-metal band or whatever other crap that happens to be on the top of the charts, Guitar Player will have at least two or three out of, say, five articles on bands that the average guitar player hasn't heard of or at least isn't totally sick of hearing of. The reasonI gave it 4 stars is that they do have too much on reviewing equipment which can be kind of boring as none of their ""reviews"" are what I'd call reviews. For example, in their last issue I don't think they gave one bad review. They're almost as bad as Ebert & Roeper!"
1,Still waiting,"I'd love to say how great this magazine is, but I still have not received the first copy. I hope that it will arrive soon."
5,The Top Of The Guitar Heap,"Guitar Player has long been atop the guitar magazine heap, with nice coverage across all musical genres. I enjoy all of the guitar magazines, but this one is tops."
5,yay,as i'm a karaoke queen Ive been looking for more evanecence songs.. I came across this cd love it will be takeing it down the karaoke next time I go... you can also buy my cd of my own songs i write on amazon just search elkapath
3,where is my magazine? Haven't received it yet!,I ordered this magazine on 11/30 -- it is now 2/1 and it still has not arrived. Can't really rate the magazine since I haven't gotten it yet.
5,Have liked House Beautiful Magazine for Years!,"House Beautiful Magazine is one of those magazines that you can get lost in. All those beautiful rooms. All those decorating tips. Some you can use and some you'll probably never use. Many of the homes and decorations are not for the average person. Nevertheless, it's still fun to dream. I know it's a decorating magazine, but I sure would appreciate more recipes!"
1,Where are the magazine?,"I ordered these magazines, but I only received one. Where are they? Poor service! Take my advice.Don't order!!!!"
1,House Beautiful Magazine,"It has been more than a month, but I still have not received House Beautiful magazine yet."
4,Just as title says: Beautiful,Superb magazine with beautiful ideas for decorating your home. Application and selection of colors bring out the best in design features.
1,Slooow delivery!,Ordered since 27/11/09. Still no mag 31/01/10. I'm still hopeful though. Ordered Cosmo which is by same pulisher and received last week in December.
1,house beautiful,Zero stars - placed an order and needed to change the address after placing the order. That was about 4 weeks ago! Still waiting for my first magazine to arrive! So much for customer service!! I will probably not use Amazon again for a magazine subscription.
1,Magazine review,I am very disappointed! I purchased a year subscription to House Beautiful from Amazon.com in November 2009. I have not received a single issue and recently received a postcard stating that I would not be receiving any at all that they now want to substitute my purchase with Woman's Day. A magazine that I have no interest in. I don't feel that a company should be able to do something like this unless they are NEVER going to publish another issue of the magazine.
2,Not for me,"I ordered this magazine hoping it would be a bit more practical. It has beautiful pictures but few that appeal to me. And the magazine is mostly advertisements; they don't say ""to the trade,"" but they look like they probably sell only wholesale. If I were a professional designer, perhaps I would find it more useful, but I'm not, so I don't."
3,they work good,"as far as the pan itself, it works, and the bunnies like it. the locking part not so much. it screws on but dosent stay on"
3,"The ""trip"" gets a little long.....","I love Cantrell, but some of these songs sound forced. I guess I've been spoiled by AIC. Nothing is ever going to compare to that sound, not that he's trying to duplicate the success. It'll probably have to grow on me. I did however gain an apreciation for the original Degredation CD in listening to this version. All the new songs aren't as good as the first batch except for track 12 on vol.2 I think I like that more because it could totally pass for an Alice tune. I swear it sounds like Layne on that track."
1,Did I listen to the same CD's other reviewers did?,"I did not like this set at all. It's even worse when compared to what Alice In Chains released. These songs, as previously mentioned, are plodding. Jerry's vocals don't sound good, either. Boggy Depot was MUCH better than this. Get that CD if you want to hear what Jerry can do."
4,Helpful,"My iphone had an accident resulting in the misalignment of the back of the phone. I ordered this set of screw extractors to take out a stripped screw so I could take the back off and put it back on properly. I could not get the screw extractor to work at all. However, one of the small screwdrivers included in the set did work to get the stripped screw off. So the set was helpful, but not in the way that I expected. So yay! I saved $150+ $30 for a manditory phone support fee. That's how much it would have cost me to have apple fix it. This set only cost something like $18. Yay, again!!!"
2,Save your money,"I believe the header says it all, just pure garbage,didnt worl at all,and impossable to see the unmarked tips or which one was the screwdriver"
4,Good Set for occasional use,"I purchased this set primarily for the screw extractor tool included in the set. The set is nice and light weight and works well for mini screw drivers that you would use once in a while. I would not recommend this set if you were to use it on a regular basis, as the grips are a little narrow for this. Also the heads may be too short for some deeply set screws. The clips also get in the way, but these can be removed.As for the screw extractor, when I first saw it I thought there was no way it would work. But with little effort I was able to extract a screw from my laptop (that came factory striped by Foxconn) that had no thread left to grip too. In addition, that screw was in there tight, but the extractor had no problem griping the gnarled screw head.I would recommend this for anyone looking for a compact screw extractor for small electronics."
3,Interesting information,Found the information most interesting but not what I was expecting. Seeking more on a particular area and their living more than one persons perspective.
1,I completely agree with Joy,"I would give this zero stars if I could - I subscribed to this magazine for years, and with the editor changes came extreme disappointment and cancellation of my subscription. The formerly classy, liberated Glamour became the voyeristic, sex-obsessed Cosmo. Gone were the entertaining and frequently thought-provoking articles, replaced by articles of ridiculous fashion advice (sure, I can see wearing a midriff halter, micro-mini, and blazer to my bank job) and what men want us to do in bed, peppered with silly photos of lingerie-clad women rolling around in the sheets. I don't dislike Cosmo, but if I wanted to read Cosmo, I'd read Cosmo - I no longer have that choice. Glamour used to have a sophisticated slant to it that felt like we were getting an edge - not anymore. I'm still disappointed, and I'm surprised more people aren't that would suggest to Glamour to make the change back. Too bad for me, and a big step down for Glamour."
2,glamour not for teens,This magazine is full of very adult advertising. They seem to aim towards teens but most of it is advertising. I had a hard time finding an article that wasn't selling something. I thought is was interesting enough for my 19 year old but realized its not even interesting enough for my 15 year old niece.
4,Love it,"In a world full of teen magazines, I am thankful to have a grown-up outlet for pleasurable reading."
3,Knitting Stitch,This is good little handbook but not anything compared to the Harmony Guides if you're looking for a good stitch dictionary. Nicely put together and the hidden spiral binding makes it easy to use. A good beginner's book.
2,Good Magazine...if you receive it,"I ordered this magazine for a class I was taking last semester at college. I really did enjoy the articles I read in class. My only problem with the magazine was that I never received it. After calling Harpers about four times I got two magazines from the previous two months, but now I am still waiting for both last and this month's editions. Happy reading...if the magazine reaches you!"
4,A rich mix with bias to the Left,"Harper's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest American- writers , from Mark Twain on down. Its editor and tone- setter is the veteran journalist Lewis Lapham. It publishes fiction, and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of American economic, political and cultural life. It attracts the big - names in all areas, and also provides a lot of human - interest material, statistical curiosities, historical information and stories.For some reason which I do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite. And in the old days I preferred 'the Atlantic' and the 'Saturday Review of Literature ' to it. Of course one of the features of 'Harper's is its book- reviews done by among others today, John Leonard.I suppose what has soured me a bit on 'Harper's' is its bias to the political left.But that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality."
4,From the samples it sounds like another winner to me,"I just wanted to correct the review. ""Ain't It Something"" isn't new. It's on the I Love Everybody CD. Lyle Lovett has put out 3 or 4 cds since Joshua Judges Ruth and they're all worth a listen."
5,What a fun game!,"Syberia II for X Box is such an excellent game. Women especially will love the touching storyline, adventure and breathtaking graphics. As a follow-up to Syberia for X Box, this was a lovely conclusion to the somewhat disappointing ending of the first. I have never really played video games, but I really liked the setup of this game. The controls are easy to learn, and if you played the first game, they are pretty much the same. I am just so impressed with both Syberia games. I wish they made more games like this (games that women enjoy to play)."
4,King Leonidas,"Great movie action figure. Good for the collector, not necessarily for children to play with, mainly because of the small, sharp objects. More articulation than a Mcfarlane action figure. I use it mainly as a display on a shelf next to my Mcfarlane King Beowulf action figure."
2,Yoga pants,"The fabric for these are very thin, evidenced by them being shipped in an envelope that fits in my mailbox. They also run small. I wear a size 6 in jeans (I'm 5'6"" and weigh 138) and needed to return the medium and get a large. Due to the thin fabric, they are suitable only for me to wear at home. Unfortunately, this vendor only replaces the item for like items or issues store credit. I won't use this vendor again."
3,Guy's review,"This book is a very good book for total beginners, however more experienced aquarist may find it a little basic. However this book does contain some very useful information and should not be overlooked."
2,DVD played out of sync on my DVD Player,I enjoyed the content but did not care for the fact that when I played it on my A/V receiver - DVD player the voice was not synced up with the picture. Have not had this problem on any other DVD. Tried to make it better my manipulating the controls available on my A/V Receiver but could not get it perfect. Not sure if the disc was defective.
1,Poor response to a request for order status,The magazine is ok. The response from your Magazine Subscription/Administrator is woefully inadequate. I ended up ordering twice because I could not find the status of the first order. I am not happy and probably will not order magazines from Amazon again. David Furr
1,"Magazine's ok, spam is not","I used to subscribe to field and stream and found that it had decent articles, I was a boy scout and liked the camping tips and such. I figured I'd give it another shot, and ordered it back in July, thinking I could get some hunting tips for the fall. Well it's late September and I still haven't seen my first issue. I did get a letter from field and stream offering me a great deal for an 18 month subscription, I was kinda hoping to get a magazine before I re-upped my subscription. Also I've started getting letters and magazines from the weirdest companies and organizations. I thought it might be because I'd just come off active duty, but no one else I knew was getting them. It occurred to me when I got an NRA letter which I haven't gotten since I was a kid, that this was probably the source. So to make a long review short, I wanted a magazine, not a mailbox full of cigar adds, and subscription updates (especially since i still haven't gotten a single magazine)"
3,Standard late Duke fare....,"This was by no means a Duke classic, but standard fare for his later westerns. It was about a group of men helping a widow recover hidden gold she was told about by her late husband. Hot on their trail are 20 bad guys after the loot. A real twist ending and some great explosions and outstanding scenic backdrop. Too bad this is not avail in widescreen. The Duke in his standard tough as nails ex-cavalry role. It's not as bad as it's reputation but I think it could have been better if they gave the bad guys some characterization and persona. But instead they are just shown as 20 faceless riders every now and again. No speaking roles in the whole lot. Better than Rio Lobo but not as good as Chisum, The Shootist or The Cowboys."
3,"Not really a jewel in the crown of the Duke, but...","still watchable.The cast is well known, with Ann-Margret, Rod Taylor and many other familiar faces in this genre surrounding John Wayne.The story is a simple one, just with a twist at the end of the movie.The DVD is nicely produced, but lacks a booklet, or other special stuff that could at least clarify somewhat, how the movie was made and perhaps include some cut-out scenes.Just for the die-hard Duke fan.If you're not, don't waste your money. There are better ones out there of the same time period. See Big Jake, Cahill, or the real runner, The Cowboys."
4,great soundtrack,i got to admit that the selling point for me was the Dominic Frontiere soundtrack. he has some good themes going here and variations of them in service too! at times the sound track carries the picture in ways the actors and screenplay can't
3,great condition but...,I didn't know it was in Japanese. Good thing for subtitles. Movie was good. Fast shipping. I just must have missed the print of it being in another language.
4,A Los Alamos boyhood: factual and fascinating,"In ATOMIC CITY Terry Rosen remembers his years of growing up in a small city like no other: Los Alamos, N.M. in the 1940s and '50s. In this place there were few ""ordinary"" people. The family friends were the likes of Edward Teller, Enrico Fermi, James Tuck, and Robert Oppenheimer. The children of famous physicists, his playmates.Yet Rosen is not a name-dropper. Instead he tells tales, often very funny, of boyhood pranks and adventures, like those of a Huck Finn or a Penrod, but set in a deeply serious place and time when the nuclear bomb was being developed and tested.The scientific information is impressive but not overwhelming. Rosen explains clearly, but the thrust of the book is not technical: it is how it was to be a kid in this unique place, with a father who works long hours and an artistic mother who puts up with an active boy and his friends.The juxtaposition of carefree childhood with the birth of the atomic bomb makes for a fascinating read."
4,Ernie Ball 2804,Ernie Ball Group II bass strings work great on my 67 Mustang short scale bass. Good resonance. Been playing this bass since 1967: country and classic rock in small-medium venues.
2,Very little Biblical foundation,"I purchased the book in hopes to read a Biblical version on the story of Rahab. No one really knows what happend in the Bible sufficient to fill in all the details of Rahabs life as a child, becoming a harlot, and the interaction with the spies. I am open to practical, literary freedom if it gives the reader a better appreciation for the circumstances. But the author took too many liberties providing colorful details. For example when she was learning to become a harlot there were small portions of text where I felt like it was too descriptive and could have been better served to let the reader imagine or 'read between the lines'. Additionally, the book has curse language in it, although tame by modern standards.Is this still supposed to be a Christian book based on Biblical principles? Rahab may not have lived by Biblical principles but as readers and authors we should."
1,Where's the Fashion?,"Most of it was ads, and not very compelling ads either. I wasn't impressed. And I won't be renewing. Lame."
1,DONT,"Don't bother ordering Hearst magazines. Both Harpers Bazaar and House Beautiful come intermittently, late, or not at all. I see the magazine I would like on the shelf, and wonder if or when I will receive my copy. I finally just canceled. what a shame."
3,magazine ok but unhappy with Amazon,I purchased this magazine subscription through Amazon because Amazon sent me a $5 off coupon code on my next order. I placed the order and used my coupon. A week after Amazon emailed me and said that the coupon was not valid and would not be taken off my order.
2,A visual treat -- but that's about it,"""Harper's Bazaar"" has been running a losing race with ""Vogue"" for the past 40 years. The magazine should play to its strengths. Its graphics and photo layouts are terrific. However, the articles are insipid and superficial; not worth a read. ""Bazaar"" unfortunately went downhill when Liz Tilberis took over the top spot; in the 60s and 70s the look was all about elegance and glamour. Ms. Tilberis stated in an editorial in the 90's that fashion was all about ""youth and ectomorphism"" and featured human Barbie dolls in grunge outfits. Okay, it looked funny, but what woman over 25 would spend good money to look like that? The impression one gets from reading ""Bazaar"" now is that it's still trying to find its target audience. When ""Bazaar"" stops acting as if it were afraid to compete with Vogue and emphasizes its strengths, it will be a much better magazine."
2,renewal,Most of the 15 or so magazines I renewed through amazon came in as dupilicates. You ad says you would extend the subscription. The problem lies with the magazine subscription house.
1,NEVER GOT IT,ITS BEEN ALMOST A YEAR AND I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY FIRST ISSUE. NEVER CONTACTED ME. HORRIBEL COMPANY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.
1,NEVER GOT IT,DO NOT SUBSCRIBE IT AT AMAZON. I NEVER GOT ANY ISSUE!TOTALLY WASTE OF MONEY! I RATHER BUY A CUP OF COFFEE.
3,haven't yet received it,"I'll let you know, but I think it'll take another week or 2 until I receive it-- subscriptions take at least 6 weeks to begin"
4,"Fun to play, and gives a small view on money","Monopoly is a game that almost all ages will like. The game lasts a long time, and never gets old, or tireing."
4,elmore leonard at his best,"la brava is vintage leonard.its one of his best books by far.joseph la brava is an ex- secret service agent who becomes a photographer.he meets a once famous actress who is being harassed by two chumps that are looking for an easy score,but thats where la brava steps in.highly recommended."
1,very short & to the point,if I could rate NO star I would had done so...this is a WASTE of your time & money...'nuff said..woowee this is one helluva stinker!
5,I bought this book I while back when we were starting a antique bottle collection.,It helps know the value when we can look it up in a book. We don't want to over pay when making bids on line.
1,Just because it is Kovels it is supposed to be good?,"Doesn't make sense that this book is recommended just because it is a ""Kovels"" I think it is over rated. Author has a business vs a real passion for antiques and it shows. I purchased this book, but I can not recommend this book. It didn't have an example of what I was looking for."
3,I Have Found Several Marks In This Book,This book is full of marks. I used it for pottery and crocks and no longer need the copy I have. I will sell it now.
5,great thinking game,"A great game my husband got me into. I would suggest playing with at least 3 players, because if only two play (certainly in our house,) whoever gets to go first usually wins. If you don't want a game where you have to think, don't get it. Also watch the pieces if you've got small children, and low VCR's!"
5,An Amazing Game,"In this game you'll need to have lots of strategy and maybe a little luck. You have scattered armies on different global territories, and advance and battle your enemies. When I play with my friends lots of times we are trying to rule 1 continent at a time. Maybe it will take a while to get all the rules in your head so don't play with young kids. Great for a family game night, you can finally get revenge on your evil sister, and still ally with your twin. In short, an amazing game."
3,Game enthusiasts read on!,"This is a great game for younger people who want an easy to learn strategy game with a good deal of random elements. I only gave the fun factor a three but I do remember that I used to love the game when I was younger. 15 years ago I would have given it a 5 for fun. Now that I am 30 and a more seasoned game player, the strategy is not as interesting and the game play is often stressful. Due to the fact that you have to single out another player to attack, arguments and hot tempers go hand in hand with this game.There are much better strategy games out there which are also less confrontational. I suggest ""Settler's of Catan"" and ""Elfenland"" for people interested in the trying best that the gaming world has to offer. These games, while fairly simple, have a more interesting balance to them."
1,Received defective,"I purchased the game for my nephew for Christmas. When he opened the game, the game board paper was torn off of half of the board. I contacted Hasbro on December 30 and again on January 6 and have yet to get a response. I will take this into consideration before purchasing another Hasbro game."
5,Risk Rules,"Risk is a great strategic game where up to six players try to conquer the world!There are infantry, calvary and cannons. Conquer the territories of the world and be a master5 out of 5 stars definetly"
5,"Best strategy board game ever... after Chess, of course!","Chess cannot be compared to any Strategy games.. ever. But, if I chose one, it would be Risk. I own it for past 5 years and had lot of fun with friends and family playing this game. You might want to make few home rules once you play a lot and it gives whole new twist to original game.Few home rules you might want to add is to allow attack from multiple regions or to be able to continue attack from other different regions.Best strategy is to concentrate army and capture small continents like Aussie, Africa or South America and build base from there on.Playing with 'Missions' in this game enhances the excitement and induces suspense as well.If anyone likes to play Chess or Bridge; Risk is MUST OWN game."
1,Very good topic - very bad book.,"I've been teaching traditional karate for 13 years now and there is a big need for good information on training issues related to women. This book attempts to provide that but does worse than fail - it misinforms. I believe Monica Cardoza had the best of intentions, but her lack of experience turns her writting into a disservice. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing as they say. Monica Cardoza's information is so error riddled - even on basic facts - that it brings into question everything else she has to say.It was painful to read this book - a book that I had high hopes for because of its foreward, which was written by Carol A. Wiley. If you're looking for ""A woman's guide to martial arts training"" or something in that vein, then avoid this book. Check out the excellent books by Carol A. Wiley instead."
1,Forced subscription !!,"I have never subscribed to GQ, but yesterday I got a statement from them charging me $19.97 in due amounts for 12 issues (that i never asked for and never got either !)And it comes with a harrasment note indicating that ""Defaulting on your account could lead to outside collection""They are trying to force me into paying for a subscription I never asked for. !!Anybody know where to complaint for these kind of annoying threats ??"
1,Neither Quarterly nor Gentlemanly,"Instead, monthly and vulgar. Don't waste your time. What was once a respectable magazine now aspires to be Maxim."
1,Not a great man magazine anymore,"Not a great man magazine anymore, i spent my money to buy ads. wont buy it anymore since i've been ordered it for 10 years."
3,I paid for advertisements.,"OMG, there's just comes with overwhelming amount of advertisements. It's a OK magazine. It is not as good as once it before."
2,golf magazine,this was a gift to my brother. i have no idea if he's started receiving it yet. can someone let me know?
2,Mag review,"to date, my subscription hasn't started yet. Hopefully, we will begin getting Golf magazine soon."
5,Torx socket,"I use this for my rotors and Magura brakes on my mountain bikes. They require a specific torque setting and it is hard to find torx sockets that fit on a torque wrench. This is perfect for that application. Very durable impact-wrench quality steel. Expect it will last a long, long time without wearing out."
2,Beware! You want the Import CD.,"Just a word of warning here...Take a look at the track list. A mere 11 tracks comprise this release.The Import version is the one you want, that has over 20 tracks, making this release irrelevant."
1,Why the Wait?,"I haven't actually received this magazine yet. I have been subscribing to it for about five years now. This year I decided to go through Amazon's service because it seemed to save a little money. I renewed the subscription through Amazon in December and have still never received an actual magazine. It looks like I won't get one until March. I don't understand why, since all of this is electronically done, it takes so long to received your first issue. Not worth it, considering I ordered my very first Family Fun with the little card that comes in the magazine and got it faster than this takes. 3 months is a long wait for a magazine subscription in my opinion."
5,awesome!,these liners are amazing. we extend the life of the pack by washing and reusing the peed-on-only ones and flushing the poopy ones. in rewashed ones hold up really well through a few washings and work just as brilliantly as the first time. we do put them in the wash inside a mesh bag with our cloth diapers so they aren't as much as a hassle of pick out.
3,"It worked, but we no longer use it.","We use this product for a while, until we got tired of picking them out from the basket full of dried diapers, sticking to everything because of the static and do not lay flat easily.Now we just scoop the poop with a hard plastic spatula, toss in the toilet, and wash off the rest under the running water with a vegetable brush. Its really not too bad, and better for the environment and your wallet."
4,Life savers for those new to cloth diapering!,"I had heard mixed reviews on these, but decided to try them out. These are great! They held my older son's poo extremely well so I just put it right in the toilet and flushed! My only complaint is that they are pretty rough on their little bums at first. It doesn't say on the package, but you can put these through the wash! If they just pee in it, I throw them in the wash with my diapers and dry them on low, again with the diapers. They come out nice and soft and ready to use! I think you can probably get 3 washes/dries out of them before they start to degrade.I definitely recommend this product!"
4,cloth diaper liner,"Good product. I had a little trouble with my two yr old developing a rash once I started cloth diapers. Not sure if it's the diaper, liner, or wrap? Anyway, these are handy! Dump the liner & poop in toilet and if you're lucky you don't have to rinse the diaper at all! My daughter had some blowouts when we first used these so there was poop on the diaper for sure-however the Whisper Wrap kept it contained!"
3,Be careful about flushing!!,"I have been pleased with the performance of this product overall. I do agree that they are too big for the diaper but I also cut them in half and double my amount, making a perfect fit.HOWEVER, I would be very careful about flushing these. I just spent $225 for a plumber to come and snake out our main drain. Guess what he found? A big wad of diaper liners (and I've only been using them for two weeks and flushing only the soiled #2 ones). From now on they will be bagged and go in the trash. he said they probably would not create an issue if the drain was brand new PVC, but the old style drains cannot tolerate such products. Buyer beware!!!"
3,"They work, but there are better out there","These were the first liners that I used, but they won't be my last! I really love the liner concept and probably wouldn't have switched to cloth diapers without them, but these liners aren't as smartly designed as CuteyBaby's.Pros: No septic problems with flushing them, they hold together in the wash if you wanted to reuseCons: They are too wide for my Fuzzibunz and so we have to fold them to make them fit. Also, they are pretty rough material. I feel a little sad covering up such soft diapers with them!What I'm switching to when I run out: Cutey baby's Biodegradable Liners[[ASIN:B0036QV93C CuteyBaby Biodegradable Diaper Liners - 6 PACK], they are incredibly soft and a perfect fit!"
4,Not a great fit.,"These get the job done, but they are a little wide for the diaper and not terribly soft. They do stand up to washing well, and are a good value for the money. I have not used them long enough to see how the affect the septic system, but they make flushing the poop very convenient."
5,This book sizzled!! I couldn't put it down!!!,"Jon Salem's Remember September is a page turner in the truest sense of the word. It's a real roller coaster, from the beginning until its thrilling climax. If you like books with nonstop excitement and romance, you will love this one! It's incredible! It has well defined characters, snappy dialogue, and great plot twists. Jon Salem-----we'll be watching your career with great interest!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I had expected a large print version, not just a hard-bound version of a book I already have in paperback."
3,Bad for a heyer.. but an ok read,"My main problem with this book is how long it takes to get to any point Heyer is trying to make. I have read a lot of her books and found them a lot of fun, but in this one the sheer wordiness took away a lot of the fun for me. As an example, when the Marquis throws a ball for the merriweathers, was it really necessary to describe the clothes and the jewels of everybody from the assembled matrons to the leading ladies in exhausting detail (from the color of the under dresses?). Same goes for the locomotive interests of Felix. At every step so many characters were introduced in such exhausting detail, that after a point I gave up trying to follow all of them and just started skipping pages to get to the main characters and their interactions."
5,Best Board Game Ever Is... Clue!,"This is the best toy in the world! I don't own a Clue board gamebut when my friend brought it to school on Game Day, I couldn't stop playing. Besides it's a perfect classic! Parker Brothers games are SOO cool!"
5,Clue - Love it! My boys and I have had so much fun with it!,"Love it! My boys and I have had so much fun with it! This game never gets old. I could not find it in the stores, they have changed the versions of the game. I was delighted to find it on Amazon. My boys and I have played it many times already and I know we will play it many more times."
5,A dectectives game,The game clue is a wonderful game for dectives. When I first played it I didn't want to stop. This game is educational for people who would like to be a detective. Clue is one of my favorite games.
1,Wrong game! Not the one pictured,The picture shows the classic clue game with statues of each character...that is what I ordered. I was given the new version of clue! This is not the one pictured! So very unhappy...You should not show the picture of the clue game if that is not the one you are selling and shipping!!
1,very poor quality,"Been looking for those for a long time. Was very exited to find them online and ordered 2 pairs. Shipment took a week. When I finally got it and put the first sock on it ripped right from the toe hole up. What a disappointment! I was very careful putting the other sock on, tried it on with the open toe shoe. It looked great! However when I removed the shoe my sock had a huge hole on the back. So, one pair is going to the garbage can and I am afraid to try on the second pair. The sock itself is a great idea but this particular one is a very poor quality!One star is for the idea. Would not recommend this to anyone."
5,Unbelievable!,"Unreal Tournament G.O.T.Y. edition is totally on another specrum of first person shooter games. The graphics, stages, game modes, and sounds are all light years ahead of their competition. The game is extremely fun to play-you'll be staring at the screen for hours upon hours upon days. The multiplayer gaming aspect is also top-notch. Finding LAN or internet games is simple. The virtual ""bots"" also benefit from advanced artificial intelligence that makes them behave like a real player would. In short, this game is a must have-even if you already own the first UT. Try it; you won't be dissapointed."
5,Godlike!,Very fun game. I was told to get this game... so yeah. I like the online multiplayer the best. Kudos to all UT gamers!!!
5,A game that shall be remembered...,"Unreal Tournament is so good a game in terms of strategy and its ability to satisfy desires only its fans can comprehend, that it will be remembered for years to come. This game is a milestone in the gaming industry. No other first person shooter, not even UT 2003, comes near in terms of the fanaticism this game can generate. Hats off to the creators of UT!"
1,Wasn't working well,When I received the mini version of Simon trickster it did not work.1. The lights were not very shiny and someone has dropped it or something. Had to throw it in the trash. So a bummer.
5,Good for all ages,"My grandchildren and I like to play this game along with their parents. Some of the questions are ones children might know but grownups don't so it is evenly matched. The last time I played, my 11 year old grandson won. I highly recommend this as a family game."
4,Get in the swing,"I've had a subscription to this mag for years. Great stories and the photos are top of the line. While it was a much better pub when the NY Times owned it (the people who worked there actually golfed), since Conde has bought it, it's gone downhill a bit. Still, it's hard to kill a great sport."
5,Gift purchase,Ordered this as a birthday gift for a good golfer friend of mine. He really enjoyed it for several years with absolutly no problems whatsoever. Good service.
4,Problem with back dated issues,"While the magazine looks fine my problem was with the back dated issue I got when I subscribed. Although with this magazine, which is not that current anyway, it's not a big deal, but I would prefer the subscription start with the current month so that I'm not getting the first two issues at the same week."
3,REVIEW part 2,"I already reviewed this album. I come back now to re-review it. I have now placed Ramon Vargas among my most favorite voice to hear right after my other favorite: Pedro Infante. Before I knocked a few stars for the song selection. But I must say that it's good to hear those songs on his voice. Again, I wished Marquez would not have used his Danzon arrangement on Besame Mucho. Also Ramon Vargas voice overshadows the orchestra. I would of liked him working with arrangers like Ruben Fuentes, Eduardo Maguellanes, or the like. I give it 3 stars because the voice does not match the arrangements or the orchestra. His voice is too much for the background music that it may annoy some people. But please do buy this cd!!!!!"
5,Humility is the main virtue to help you get to heaven,This is an awesome and faithfilling book on the virtue of humility. The Cardinal who wrote the preface of this 17th century book saids you could spend a year studying this book and still not gleam all the riches it contains about the virtue of humility and how it's lifelong attainment can help weed out all your bad vices or sins and help one get to heaven. I totally agree with him! This book is for those Catholic individuals who are serious about wanting to get to heaven and through God's graces and the sacraments are trying to live down here as close to God as they can and are trying to love the rest of mankind made in the image and likeness of God.It has so much meditation material on each page of book to pray and think about. This book is also for all individuals who want to change their life for the better in living for loving God and loving other people more.
5,Well written,"I am not qualified to comment on his ability as an historian, though nothing here is contradicted by other books I have read, but I must say that the author writes well. I was put off by the book's appearance at first but once I began I found it a very enjoyable read, and it covers much that I did not find elsewhere"
2,What's new,"I eagerly ordered Good Kids, Bad Habits, hoping for new insights and parenting tips. The first problem was that my children are 12, 14 & 17 years old, and the book's advice targeted parents with much younger children. Unfortunaltely some of us with teens and preteens have still not figured out how best to shepard our children into the healthest possible lifestyles, given our modern culture.I read the book anyway, and was struck with the thought that very few of the suggestions presented by the author were new or original. Many of the main stream suggestions have been in parents' magazine articles for decades. The title and cover of the book were the most creative and original part of the package.The author is a pediatrician, yet little or no science graced the pages.Of course I was not been able to bring myself to toss the book in the recycle bin. So I have donated the paperback to the local library. A 5 minute scan of the text at the library, should provide you with all its insights."
2,It's difficult for self-studying person,"I am using several business law textbooks for my self-study.Comparing to others,this book is difficult to understand.The selection of the Cases differs from others which makes me confused.Structure of the content differs too.It's a complicated book to understand for a self-studying person."
4,Its nice but pricey,I really do like this brand of shampoo and conditioner. It does make your hair look and feel great. The one main drawback is price. Although this seller has one of the better price points I've seen. So if you have extra money to spend or really want to treat yourself this is a great product.
4,Excellent Summary,"The Knight in Historyis an excellent summary of the evolution, maturity, and dissolution of the knight in Europe. Provides context, details, and scholarly rigor to an oft-neglected topic in Western history.Recommended!"
5,DW games are the best,"The bad things of this game is not for 2 players,not enough game modes only free mode and moscou mode and not enough stages.However the graphics and gameplay of this game rocks i could play this for 24 hours if i have a chance.There is some really hard generals like lu bu,it took me almost 10 minutes to defeat him.Overall this game is extremely entertaining and fun as hell to play."
3,"Gets old, just rent it.","This game was made beautifully, it's graphics are great, and the game is fun AT FIRST. After the 3rd level, you get sick of it. It is just hack and slash, hack and slash. I suggest renting it for a week. That's all the game's timespan is."
2,"Good concept, only 5 maps?!?","The first few times I played the game, I really enjoyed it. However, after completing the 5 levels twice, I am completely sick of it. Another five to ten levels that could be unlocked by completing the game would have made all the difference.Good concept and great graphics, but only about 3-4 hours (tops) of gameplay and no multiplayer really kill this one. Don't buy it new, as I suspect there will be plenty of used copies of it out there."
3,"Just an ""OK"" Nekromantix release....","I really tried to like this record, and the truth is that I don't dislike it. It just isn't as good as their first three records. Some of these songs lyrics also strike me as borderline, if not all-together, ""DORKY"" as well. Just not as wild, or as evil as they used to be, and the new songs just don't have the same drive to em' that makes you want to get up off your chair and jump up and down. Songs like ""Subculture Girl"" are almost embarassing for me to listen to, while others are actually pretty decent. Seems like they might be aiming for the real young crowd. Could this have anything to do with HELLCAT records I wonder........?????.....mmmmmmmm....."
4,Educational and Fun,"This was a very enjoyable read. Lederman's love of science - both its history and its current practice - comes through on every page. It is a book that can be enjoyed by anyone with curiosity about the universe and what goes on at the smallest scales within it. The only drawback that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it is a bit dated now and does not account for some of the latest theories, but it's still well worth reading in spite of that."
4,"Good, but not Great","This is billed as the ""funniest book about physics ever written."" But that's not saying much, the humor is mostly one-liners tossed in here and there, which starts to get old after about 400 pages.It has a pretty good, comprehensive history of physics. It was interesting to learn that ""theorists"" and ""experimenters"" are two discrete groups within the field of physics. It was also interesting to read about the stories of who/how the discoveries were made, although it seems as though they were often having inspiration on Friday afternoons and having to work day and night all through the weekend - did they never have inspirations on Monday?Some of the math gets a bit dense, even though Lederman promised that it wouldn't be. But overall, this was an interesting book, even if I had to glaze over some of the dense math."
5,Who Says Physics Can't Be Fun?,"This book proves something that I have long suspected about physicists; a lot of them are children at heart, and they approach the physical world with the same sense of awe and glee that a child does by instinct.Lederman has a lot of fun here, writing a chronological account of particle physics in a narrative style yet the book contains enough non-physics humor to captivate someone totally disinterested in the world of physics. I particularly enjoyed his little elbow-jabs at those lazy physics theoreticians, since he himself is a technician of physics.I unreservedly recommend this book to anyone. I don't think you will be disappointed."
5,"It's funny, interesting, and eye opening","I have to say that my 2 favorite non-technical science books are Hawking's A Brief history of Time, and Lederman's the God Particle. Both deal with complex physics in a non-mathematical way. I can't say i understood the whole book, however because of this I want to major in Physics. It's both extremely funny, and as informative as a textbook. All of history should be written in Lederman's style"
3,Photo is diferent then the product,"I thought this was a good deal a complete set of torx bits for $4.76, wow! I should have read all the print that is my fault but sellers photo is very misleading, shows a whole set and was only sent 1 small piece. I like to look at a accurate image of the product before making the purchase as do most people."
3,"Over Priced, Over Rated, and Under Fun","As a fan of the original Trivial Pursuit, I was anxiously awaiting opening this package underneath our Christmas tree. However, I was very disappointed in what I opened.1) The pieces are translucent, and very hard to distinguish.2) The board is almost paper thin, and does not seem durable at all, unlike the original version.3) The board is also very distracting, too ""busy"".4) The Literature category is gone.5) As mentioned in another review, the cards are loose in the ""box"" (actually, a pie piece shaped metal tin), and easily lost or mutilated.6) Some of the cards were repeats. We found a duplicate card 1/4 of the way through our first game.7) Not worth the price. Wait until it's on sale to buy it.My son's Junior Trivial Pursuit game (also bought through Amazon) was much more durable and fun."
5,"Wonderful, Educational!",Great for parties! Our family never is bored with this game. When we have friends over the first things my kids do is bring out the game! I really recommend this game. It's well worth it.
3,It's Okay,"I bought this game for my boyfriend's parents for Christmas. I thought it would be a wonderful game, because we all enjoyed playing the regular edition together so much, but the older questions weren't always fair, because most of us are still in college. However, we were quite distrubed by the difficulty of these questions. We were playing with two librarians, one with a PhD., an author, and four above average college students, and still couldn't finish a game, because no one could answer the questions. We will still play it, but we will make sure we have a long time for the game."
3,Not enough trivia questions!!,"This version does not come with the standard amount of question cards, so you ""go through"" them quite quickly. After a few nights of fun, we were already through ALL the cards! But, the questions are all new and exciting! The picture cards are fun and add a new twist to the trivial pursuit game. The board is fun and very graphic, as well as the new ""see-through"" pieces. I have enjoyed this game, but would have been more satisfied with the standard issue card quantity."
3,Same old...same old,"I love Trivial Pursuit. I play about once a week. I got the Millenium edition for two reasons, 1. it comes in a cool box and the marketing stuff worked on me, and 2. new questions. The box is cool, but only half the questions seem new. Another thing that bothers me about this game is that unlike the old versions that had two or three card holders, this only has one. It seems like a nit picky thing, but it is annoying once you start playing. I love Trivial Pursuit, and I had to own this, but I probably would have been better with a ""Know it all"" edition."
3,A book review by a 9 year old girl,"I gave this book a rating of three because it didn't have an exciting beginning and it wasn't really my kind of book. But I like it a little bit when he sings, but I wasn't really into the book that much. I think someone else would enjoy this book."
3,Mortimer was OK,"I love most of the Munsch books, but this one failed to grab me. I teach ESL in New York City, and many of the Munsch books are right in line with what I want to focus on. While this one had the classic Munsch humor that my kids are used to, I wasn't thrilled with the ending. It just sort of stopped. No real conclusion. It's not his best one of the bunch (Smelly Socks and Stephanie's Ponytail are great!) but simply OK."
5,Keep doing it!,"This album just maintains the high standard of NIACIN's releases. If you know their previous albums, just get this one. If you don't, get this one and the other three. For the Live in Japan I recommend buying the DVD."
5,saxtress just keeps getting better and better,I first became aware of the saxtress Pamela Williams as a driving force in Patti Labelle's band. I was overjoyed with Pamela Williams first solo release so when i saw this title i bought it with out even listening to any samples. Evelotion is bright breezy and colorfull...the vocals only serve to compliment this outstanding production. This release came out at the end of february but i promise you will be burning up your cd player well past summer with this......soooo cool it's really so hot....
3,Evolution,"You should listen to the preview recordings on Amazon several times. I thought I liked it, but once I bought it and had played it several times, I liked it less and less."
5,Absolutely gorgeous!,Blows little Norah away :-). This is the real raw deal. Full of adult soul and passion. Don't miss it! What a songwriter!
4,Good magazine,Always bought this and women's day at the checkout counter always had good articles in it to read and up to date ads
5,great magazine fast shipping,I enjoy reading this magazine. There are always lots of things to read and new tips about home and family.
3,Average women's magazine,"This magazines has decreased in pages and lacks good advice, stories, and overall appeal. For the $5.00 paid, I guess it's ok. I would recommend buying another women's magazine."
2,haven't received my first issue yet,"I placed this order on 6-27-08 and today is 8-6-08 and I haven't received my first issue yet. Hopefully, I will receive it soon."
2,Not what I expected,"I needed something to read at the gym and the price was great. But after just my first issue I cancelled the subscription. It's just not for me, seemed boring and not for my age group (30). I should of just paid a little more for my favorite magazine ""women's world"" - great to take to the gym and to learn a thing or two."
4,Super fast delivery!,"Good Housekeeping is one of the better magazines I turn to for ideas. If you are looking for an easy read that will help you around the house (even if you are not a stay at home mom or a desperate housewife), full of ideas from cleaning the drapes to what to have for dinner, then this the right magazine for you. I placed the order in the beginning of April and I got my first issue (which I was not expecting until June ) at the end of April (May issue). What more can you ask of a magazine Subscription."
4,GOOD HOUSEKEEPING,"I would recommend this magazine to anyone as it is worth the price. All issues are filled with invaluable information for all aspects of life.I have tried countless tips, recipes and even household gadgets with 100% satisfaction."
1,still waiting for it to arrive..,"I ordered this magazine about a month ago. The initial delivery estimate was within 2 weeks, however, 4 weeks later, I am still waiting for the magazine to arrive. The shipment date now is pushed out another 2 weeks - there also has been no communication about delays in delivery etc - would not recommend it"
3,middle of the road magazine,"This is a ""return"" of Redbook and a pictorial ""Reader's Digest."" The stories are about interesting people and are well-written, but not deep. I can read the whole thing in one hour. I subscribed for house decorating and garden advice, but the magazine emphasizes health and beauty. I intend to look elsewhere."
5,A must read!!!,"With great advice and timely articles for women, Good Housekeeping is a must read! From Dear Heloise to Short Stories, GH has it all. Recent changes, in the past year, due to a new editor have kept GH fresh and constantly up-to-date. Articles are geared to young and old alike, working Moms, to women-in-general. I'm not a fan of cooking, yet its recipes are easy to prepare, and I always find at least one my family loves in each issue!"
3,Disappointed,"When I read a magazine I do not want to ""go-online"" for more information. I could just go online to begin with and skip the bill. Probably will not renew this mag. Seems like there are more ads and less info-unless I want to ""go online""."
3,Lack of audio examples,I just received my copy in the mail and I was disappointed to find that the book did not come with a cd of any sort. You have to send off for a cassette tape and pay extra for it.
2,"No rules, just random musings","I don't believe that the other review for this book is legitimate, which is why I am writing this one. I did not find this book very useful. The material is dated, and the ""rules"" are really just a collection of thoughts the author has had about the market -- nothing useful for the non-floor trader. I recommend checking this one out of the library before you buy."
1,Whatever happened to the Traditions?,"Treatment center professional uses the celebrity of his name to push his idiosyncratic ideas about recovery and religion. Can you count the Traditions breaks? On top of that, the material is not good, being weak opinions. Stick to your Big Book and don't waste your money or allow this type of huckster to give AA a bad name."
5,My Dinner with Andre,This film is brilliant! It's unlike anything you'll ever see. It inspires and engages the imagination and is a roadmap through art and philosophy.
4,exercise your mind,enjoy eavesdropping on a passionate conversation....the kind you wish you'd have more often.
2,One of the most boring films ever made.,I tried watching this once because critics gave it good reviews. This is one of the most boring films ever made. Who wants to watch a movie where two guys are talking over dinner? This is the sort of pompous and pretentious film that tries to pass itself off as art.
3,ART HOUSE STUFF,"They meet in a fancy restaraunt, wine and dine, and Andre tells him about being buried alive on Halloween (you bet!). And that's just the start of it. There is one funny scene where-in Andre orders the waiter to remove the pretty flowers from the table, ""We don't need those things!"". It's interesting though. Neither good or bad then. Dialogue does bristle at times, but just compare to ...Virginia Woolf, Betrayal, and Harold & Maude (all Art House too), and you'll learn how weak it really is. Appears to be RealTime, but closer examination (the ending), shows it is not."
2,Too Expensive,"For this price I could almost buy two whole monopoly games at my local walmart. I love that you can buy extra sets of the money for the game, but the price here is just way too high. Just my two cents."
3,Overpriced,"It would actually be cheaper to buy a whole Monopoly game, keep the money, and the throw the rest out. Color of the amounts does vary from some Monopoly sets but that doesn't matter. Too bad there aren't more of the higher dollar amounts rather than an excess of the lower amounts. Item arrived as promised and extremely well packed."
1,Too old of a game,"I was so disappointed when I put this game in and started playing it. This game is for 95/98 windows and it is at least 5 to 6 years old. On the CD it has 2000, so what does that say. When the game comes on the screen it is only 8 x 6 inches and that is on a 17 inch monitor. If it is on a smaller monitor it might even be smaller then that. When you play the game it is only half of that because you have all the games around it plus all the other buttons on the left. The rules on some of the games don't make sense. I had games like this and I through them away."
3,Not as great as the cover looks.,"What first got my attention was the cover, and that Rasputina put it together. I like Rasputina but the other artists really weren't that great to me,nor are the songs.(Although Miranda Sex Garden is fairly good.)If your a Rasputina fan, I would definantly check out the other artists first to see if you like them. I know I won't make judgements on cd cover art anymore."
5,A BOOK THAT YOU GOT TO HAVE,"This book is best book I ever read for C++. I have read tons of book and nothing is compaired to this one. Herber Schildt puts a great amout of time to explain everything in the chapters. The part I really like about this book is that, you have exercises that you can do to see if you understand the chapter. I think you are wasting your time reading my review, you should be buying the book right now."
2,Not a good book for serious programmers,"While Schildt's book is very readable and understandable, it's necessary to warn readers of his bad programming style. In one example class he uses a copy assignment without a copy constructor. He also uses exit() which no good C++ programmer uses.Schildt did NOT help create the ANSI C++ standard and his code most definately proves it. This book assumes a knowledge of C since it goes right into classes in CH 2 so it wouldn't be very helpful for those with no experience in C.This book is fine for those only wanting a superficial knowledge of C++, but I can't really recommend it for those wanting to know more of the language. Especially because of the glaring errors."
2,"Presentation: Good, Accuracy: Fair","The author presents the subject matter clearly. However, while referencing some of the topics he discusses with other books I currently use, he does seem to recommend programming methods that can lead to difficult debugging. This book may do better with a revision to eliminate code style that can lead to sloppy program design. Okay as a support text used in a situation where the author's suggestions are balanced with those of other author/programmers."
5,Love it!,one of my best purchases... plenty of room... nice leather and luxurious inside... little travel box is nice too...
3,Nice box,Good looking box. Good quality. Lock is useless. Needs more watch space. Can't beat the price.
5,"Honest, In Depth and Heartbreaking.","I've long been very familiar with the 1st Marine Division's history at the Chosin, but until I read Roy Appleman's book I didn't realize just how much I didn't know about the Army's side of the conflict. This tale of desperation and bravery should be required reading amongst all American service personnel and perhaps even in High Schools. Excellently written, this book holds your attention despite the huge amount of very detailed geographic and unit data presented."
2,There's A Reason Others Say This is Under-rated,"First and foremost, I'm a huge Cars fan. I have all of their albums and all of their solo efforts as well (Ric's, Elliot's, Ben's and Greg's). However, I have to say that for the group, this is their weakest release. Why else would all of those who love this call it under-rated? They may love it, but you probably won't unless you love the Cars. If you do love them get this CD because there are some good tracks. If you've only sampled their Door-to-Door CD, you might like this too because it does have that harder edge. However, if you're looking to get classic Cars which made them great get ""The Cars"" (self-titled first release), ""Candy-O"" or ""Shake It Up"". If you want their release with the biggest chart-toppers go for ""Heartbeat City"". Get this one and ""Door-to-Door"" last."
3,A step down from the previous two,"Panorama, although unique it its strange ways, was a big step down from their first two albums. Although not as bad as ""Shake It Up"", it wasnt much better either. ""Touch & Go"" must be one of the best Cars songs ever, ""Gimme Some Slack"" & ""Don't Tell Me No"" also are worth the price of the album. 3 good songs are enough for me to buy an album, and thats all there really is here. The rest is pretty much filler, I figured this was the end of The Cars as it sounded liked they'd run their course."
5,I really love this one.,"The 3rd album by The Cars, in as many years. Critics didn't like this album and a lot of fans didn't either. As for myself I enjoyed this one from the get go. This album doesn't have the upbeat sound the first two had, but it still had some good stuff anyway. ""Panorama"" #5, only produced one top 40 hit in ""Touch And Go"", #37, but they had some good tracks in, the swirling title track, the rockin' ""Gimme Some Slack"", which should of been a hit, ""Don't Tell Me No', ""Getting Through"", a fast paced raver ""Misfit Kid"", the pulsive ""Down Boys"", a Ben Orr classic ballad ""You Wear Those Eyes"", ""Running To You"" and the silly ""Up And Down"". This would end their run of 5 star releases for me, ""Shake It Up"" showed up a little more than a year later."
2,Stacker is not the way to go.,"I am an ardent Panasonic fan. All of my home electronics bear its name. However, this stacker dvd changer really is not a good product at all. Rather, it is perhaps better to say that it is the inherent flaw in this type of technology. The changer works just like the car cd changers and unfortunately sounded like one too. It is noisy and it is slow. One might find this unit acceptable if random music player is not a concern. If it is, then beware at the slow speed which this unit switch from disc to disc and the unbearable amount of noise it makes.You will be happier with a carousel type changer."
2,its like i'm entering a musical hell,"I give this album 2 stars because of the fact that they have changed. A Guided Tour of Chicago was a 5 star album. it was depressing, it was dark, it was funny, and touching. Ghost Stories was still good, but it didn't have what made AGTOC great. the two splits they did were still great albums, but if your listen to the new stuff and the old stuff you can tell the diference. And, i don't want to seem jaded and mean, but switching from Asian Man to fat wreck just makes them dim in my mind. I know, I know, say waht you will, but they're never going to be the same to me. So lissin. if you want an album that will make you understand, love, and be ridiculusly depressed at the same time, get AGTOC. if you want more main-stream, poppy kinda stuff, get this. its your choice. but i still give it two stars."
1,Poor quality,Followed directions and washed before first use. Came out of washing machine with TWO cuts in bottom sheet making it useless. A waste of money.
5,Unbeatable buy!,"These are great sheets, and the price I paid for them here was a real steal! I'm really glad I bought them!"
2,scratchy and wrinkly,"I got these on a cheap deal and was pretty excited to find such inexpensive sheets in a King size, here in California where the stores only sell ""California King"" sized sheets. However, after laundering them as directed, they came out very wrinkled, but more importantly, they are very scratchy to the skin. We tried sleeping on them last night, but I'm not thrilled. Perhaps after repeated washing and the addition of some fabric softener this may improve."
5,Absolutely brilliant,"This book is a major turning point in the 8th Doctor novels. It lays down the groundwork for some huge and far reaching story arcs later on. But a good thing about this novel is that it is very enjoyable and funny as well. I dont know if it was intended to be funny, but some parts of this story I thought were hilarious. I think it is good that a novel as important as this one can also find the time to be light hearted without detracting from the serious issues at stake. But I would only advise reading this if you have a fairly good backgroung knowledge on Dr Who. If you're new to the series then this is not good book to start on because after several chapters you'll be completely lost. But if you know your stuff when it comes to Dr Who then I would most definitely recommend this novel."
5,This novel is bloody brilliant!,"This is one doctor who novel that surpasses literary excellence,lawrence miles is a brilliant writer he uses clever plot twists and original ideas like a master sci fi writer should. whoever gives this novel three,two, or one stars doesnt know good writing if it crept up on them and taped them on the shoulder. I could not put alien bodies down the first time i read it and i have read this novel twenty times over and its been like watching a very good episode of doctor who on tv, i only wish the new series of doctor who could be written like this novel was but, then again if it was doctor who would not be labeled a childrens programme any longer. This novel is for intelligent hard core sci fi readers and not mediocre minds whose attention spans are like a micro wave oven. so if your reading level is still somewhat on a primary school level i suggest you do not read alien bodies but, if your an intelligent sci fi reader you will love this book."
5,Great Magazine,"I ordered this magazine for my husband who has an extensive construction background. I don't know the anything about building stuff, so we look at the magazine together, and I point out the things I like so he can build them for me. It has a lot of practical tid bits of information that are fun to read."
1,Handyman THIEVES - BEWARE OF SUBSCRIBING,"Ordered a subscription August 2010...never received a single issue. So I called their customer service a year later (after seeing the magazine on the newsstand triggered my memory of ordering a subscription and realizing I never received anything), and they denied any knowledge of my order, meanwhile I had a copy of my debit card transaction in front of me for -$19.99 FAMILY HANDYMAN MAGAZINE. After reading other reviews, it seems this is a common occurrence. There's obviously no way to get my money back, and I won't even give their magazine a chance anymore..."
2,For the casual DIYer...,The Family Handyman magazine is designed for the casual DIYer. The magazine usually focuses on one project or topic with each issue.Pros:- Some helpful tips- Easy readCons:- A Lot of ads. It seems like every other page is an ad.- Missing detailed project plans- If you are remotely 'handy' this magazine will seem like common sense.All-in-all I was disappointed with this magazine. It really seems like a big advertisement. It seems to lack more of the content that I was hoping for.
5,"Ideas for anyone. Thanks Amazon, reasonable prices","This is such an informative magazine, simple to understand, gobs of fix it ideas and then some. Very little technical language but written for all skill levels. I challenge anyone to find something of interest. Ideas for organization, building simple projects, not just woodworking ideas. Thank you to whoever put these ideas together for all skill levels."
1,Love the magazine hate the subscription service,"All the magazines I get from Amazon are slow to arrive. I get them weeks after the newsstand. It's very frustrating. It not only happens with Handyman, but also with Readers Digest, Popular Mechanics, and Popular Science."
1,Do Not Subscribe,"I too have been a longtime subscriber to The Family Handyman magazine. I found their ""Double-issue"" scam to be unethical and offensive. I figure my subscription is a contract: I pay my bill and I get a fixed number of issues. To arbitrarily announce that this is a ""Double Issue"" and my subscription will be reduced by one issue, amounts to breach of contract. The same has happened with subscribers to Rachael Ray's ""Everyday"" magazine. (They are both published by Readers Digest Association.)Furthermore, I have always resented their sending me ""red-letter notices"" about my ""subscription renewal"" implying that my subscription was about to expire. My subscription wasn't scheduled to expire for 2 years !! I have cancelled my subscription !!"
3,Review,Proof of Heaven was a disappointment. It was a lot of neurological detail that is not an easy read for a lay person.
5,Good book,"We have tried a few recipes from this book, and they turned out pretty good. Can't say if every recipe is good or not, but so far it has been good. Not very difficult either."
4,Where's the director's commentary?,"Just as an FYI, the case for this DVD refers to a separate track with the director's commentary, but the commentary is a no-show. Thus, only 4 stars instead of 5 for a great movie, but sub-par DVD."
3,Meeeh!,"Well...what can I say?It's not a great movie, nor a good movie. But it is wothwhile!One thing destroys this movie, THE MUSIC, I mean what were they thinking!!! It's hiddious, terrible.The directing is allright, but the 'signpost' thing is too far fetched. One thing is great though!: Rick Moranis's part!! He's great. I really stopped liking Rick after seeing ""Honey, I shrunk the kids"" but here's he's very good. (He's also good in 'Splitting Heiers'.All in all...you CAN watch this movie. Just don't get your hopes up.Ooohh...go on, watch it...it's really not ALL bad.:-)"
4,Think About Sales From A Different Angle,"The long and the short is that you WILL be seeing your interactions with customers in a different light after this read. It doesn't matter how long you have been selling, this will let you see what really makes your customer ""tick"", how to sense what their motivators are, and what will get them closer to the close."
5,It's about time!!!,"Finally, one of the best series of the 80s makes it to DVD!!! I loved this show growing up, and watched it again when one of the cable networks started running the series. And unlike so many of the shows that I thought were ""so great"" when I was young, this one withstood the test of time for me. The actors, the stories, the interaction and by-play between Rick and AJ, everything. Yes, there are some ""iffy"" episodes (what series doesn't have them?), but overall, this is a solid series that has been FAR too long in making it to DVD."
3,The (slow) start of one of the nicest tv series!,"I rated 3 stars only because the first episodes are a bit slow. Otherwise it would get a 4, definitely.It's the prelude of one of the best tv series of the 80's.Besides it's season 1! Most likely, just like me, when you realised - 20 years ago... OMG!- that you liked Simon & Simon, you also realised that you never saw the first episodes... Well, here they are!"
1,Unacceptable Packaging,I was really looking forward to watching this series again. I loved the show. But I have returned the discs because the form of packaging is totally unacceptable.The cardboard will be ruined in years to come and the tray set out is ridiculous.DVD's and CD's are not indestructible and must be handled with care.Very difficult to do when you have to get disc one out and juggle that to get disc two out.As much as I dislike plastic when it comes to DVD's and CD's they must be in plastic cases.This DVD is also unacceptable in that Previews automatically start and the main menu cannot be accessed.
4,Simon & Simon - Season One,Great tv series from the past. I had seen them many years ago and it was good to see them again!!
1,Its not fun,THIS GAME IS JUST BORING AND NOT FAIR. WHY IS IT FAIR TO HAVE TO START OVER JUST BECAUSE YOU GET BUMPED BY SOMEONE. THIS GAME REALLY FRUSTRATES ME MORE THAN ANYTHING!
4,Great Family Game,"I have a five year old and a ten year old and we love to play this game at game night. Teaches counting skills and good sportsmanship. We love yelling ""SORRY"" (when you get that card)."
4,Nice game....,"Nice game for the kids, can get a little boring but is still fun! Kids LOVE it! I'd buy it again!"
4,Great for all ages.,"I bought this game for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas and we've played it at least 20 times already. The cards are self explanatory, but I had to demonstrate the '7' where you can split the move between two pawns. She caught on easy enough and loves pulling the SORRY cards.The only complaint I have about the game itself is the board. It would've been nice if it only had one fold instead of four of them plus the split(for folding into a square instead of a rectangle). It makes the board a little uneven."
3,A lot of repetitive content each month,"Having moved to LA just a couple of years ago, I wanted to discover new cool spots in the city, especially restaurants.This magazine usually has a decent cover story, but you get through that content in like 10 minutes and the rest of magazine kind of sucks. It's a lot of repetitive content, a lot of uninteresting ads, and the multiple pages of restaurant listings are rarely updated at all.You're better off just using Yelp!"
4,I enjoy it very much,"I love having this come to my home. I used to read it only in doctor's offices and want to tear out pages of information. Hey, if you live in Los Angeles. It is great to have this subscription. The restaurant breakdowns and reviews alone are worth it. Plus you can always find out about new things to do and see. It's classy and adult."
1,Absolutely useless !!!! BEWARE !,"Length:: 0:21 MinsWhen I woke up this morning my carpet was wet , and my nose dry. It smells bad and it's worthless. You can see how the mist is going down to the floor.See my video for demo/cold mist on the left , hot one on the right/... I'll return this back to Amazon and keep using my old hot mist humidifier !"
3,Works just ok.,I was a little disappointed with this product. It works ok to humify the room and it is quieter then some of the others I have tried but the vapor just runs down the unit. The vapor doesn't spread out all that much and in the morning the area around the unit is dripping wet.
1,wet,"Left my floors soaked, even on the lowest setting. Even books 3 feet behind it were left moist. It was quite and cute. Just too powerful"
2,Leaves a horrible residue everywhere.,"I bought it for my daughter's room(she has eczema and asthma).She loved it because it was cute but thats the only plus.It leaves a white residue which has to be scraped off, doent even go after washing.The mist doesnt raise the room's humidity at all(Why's it a 'HUMIDIFIER' then???)It wets everything around it although I keep it on a big plastic mat.Stopped using it after a while because Im afraid it might aggravate her asthma."
3,Humidifier for Children,"This products work great, but the only problem is that this particular model really attracks small children so much that they think it's a toy. But it does the trick when it coming to helping children with sever cough attachs."
1,Threw my $ away,"I was hoping for a book to guide me in making my own lamp shades. This was not it. It had a few photos, but no step-by-step instructions. The book looks like it was published in the 70's. Don't waste your money."
1,GARBAGE,"No1 knows better Acosta than his own citizens, I am a great fan of him also, but this last cd that he came out is garbage, althought he is the best hard trance dj around, he blew this cd with total commercial songs, and totally played out. Most of the songs are old as well so he didnt come out with nothing new, -----songs from tiesto - urban train, The Sound Of Goodbye - Perpetuous Dreamer, . Moments Are Forever - Moon Project,Legacy - Push, Resurrection - PPKThis is the worst cd from Acosta, just download song 10, the rest is old songs or garbage"
3,Guess Who review,I bought this for a 6 year old girl. It took my husband at least 30 minutes to set it up. It was kind of hard for her to get the concept but fun once she did.
2,Great Game Poor Quality,"My 6yr old played an older version at a relative's house and was excited to use his allowance to buy one of his own. Sadly, it was a waste. The cards constantly fell out of place, making game play difficult. Also the plastic pieces broke because my children (who are in NO way destructive)continuously replaced the cards. After about 2 rounds they asked to put it in the donation box for the Salvation Army. If any good came of it, it was the discussion I had with them about only giving away nice things, not junk, to charity. The game went in the trash... where it belongs! And they wrote a long letter to the manufacturer. We were mailed coupons to buy more crappy games. Thanks guys!"
5,Christmas gift for grandson!,"When our grandson opened his Christmas gift of ""Guess Who? Board Game"" he said, ""This is exactly what I asked for!"""
3,Probably wouldn't buy again...,"This game is cheaply made. Part of the plastic stand snapped off the very first time we played. Also, the little blue windows shut SO easily on their own (mid-game)that it is easy to lose track of which characters were legitimately eliminated through your questioning and which ones were accidentally ""eliminated"" because of the self-shutting windows. Lastly, the somewhat goofy pictures make it hard to discern details...especially on the pets side of the playing card. There are even a couple of animals that my husband and I can't even tell if they are cats or dogs! Needless to say, this is quite confusing for young players. I don't think I'd buy this game again."
4,Guess who - one of the best games ever!,"I love this game and played it all through childhood and recently bought it for some laughes. It isn't durable and really isn't meant for kids who cannot identify detail - but once they can, this is a great game!"
3,A little big,"Got it for my daughter who is learning to handle ""real cups"" and its too big for her to handle. Love the idea."
4,Good books,"My 4-year old got attracted to this book right away, but too early to tell if it can keep her learning piano."
4,Prong is Kanekovision time two,"Excellent DVD and I'm thrilled to be the first one to review. I espcially enjoyed the concert footage from Denver.Tommy Victor is good peeps. If you ever get a chance to catch a live show, you will realize that this DVD does not do it justice."
4,The Temp (1993),"Very suspenseful film stars the (...) Lara Flynn Boyle as a temp who is climbing the corporate ladder faster than her boss (Timothy Hutton) and makes his life a living hell the entire wayby sabotaging his work and murdering various executives. Boyle turns in a delightfully wicked performance that rises beyond (...), and Hutton's performance as Peter Derns is exceptionally true to what any man would do. Direction and script make this taut thriller look very slick and sound authentic and real. All of the characters seem like they could be living next door. My only concern is the ending in which it rushes and tries to be dramatic with the last two words spoken by Hutton, but it only mildly succeeds. Great flick however and highly recommended!"
5,Worth the price just for Peter Kingsbery,I bought this album some years ago and have enjoyed listening to Peter Kingsbery singing Only the very best. It is an unbelievable song with an almost two and a half octave range required. I have not felt the same about any other song on the album but that song along is worth the price.
1,Piece of junk,The headphone has a standard 8mm plug and won't work with the Katana. The case is absolutely worthless. Don't waste your money on this product.
4,Better than others,"This women's magazine definitely has a lot more to offer than other women's mags. It is well rounded with fashion, beauty tips, as well as pertinent stories about women (not only celebrities) as well as recommendations for music, books, movies etc. It's definitely not the same content every month, which is the most important thing for me.Oh, and with the offer from Amazon, I got a whole year subscribtion for only $3! Nothing beats that!"
2,Not what it once was,"Marie Claire claims to be written for ""Women of the World,"" but the changes that the magazine has undergone since the new editor entered have taken this publication far from their self-proclaimed audience.The stories have become increasing vapid and sensationalized. Worse, the quality of the writing has greatly decreased overall. How sad that the editors think that a mainstream Women's magazine has to be written on the level of Seventeen Magazine!Hopefully the magazine will get through their current growing pains and become an informative and fun fashion magazine again."
4,A Good Read...And Great Content,"This is a great magazine, I love the content, the features, the stories, the reviews etc. I like the mix between reading the stories and the fashion sense that the magazine covers. Awesome read and a big thumbs up!"
1,Marie Claire,Didn't sign up for auto-renewal and don't want it! Please make it stop!The magazine is a waste of money? OK! I'll repeat do not spend your money
2,Definitely not what it used to be!,"When I was a bit younger, I subscribed to Marie Claire and it was the one magazine that didn't make me want to scream because of too much sex advice (like Cosmo), too much militant feminism (Ms.), or with everything being beauty and fashion related (almost all women's magazines!).There was something wonderful about this magazine for a young woman to read. So when I picked it up again a few months ago, I was saddened to see what direction they had chosen to go with it. Might be your style, but it isn't mine. It's just a bit too trashy anymore, the look is very sharp. I feel like perhaps they are trying to be a women's issues mag but mixing it in with how to please your man and what bikini to wear this season and it just doesn't work. I miss the old Marie Claire of ten years ago!!"
1,Never received issues,"I ordered back in September. I understand that they might not have shipped right away. I waited until November, then called. They said I was not scheduled to receive any issues until January because that was the next cycle. I said fine. I was a little irritated, but fine. I called again the end of January, after I hadn't received an issue, and was informed that it was in the mail. It is now March and I have have received nothing. I should have listened to the other reviews stating the same problem, but I let the cheap price sway me. That, and i thought, how can they not send ANY issues? Well, its true. And not just with this magazine. I am on here today to write a review from the other magazine from this same company that I have not yet received. I would give no stars if I could. This seems simply outrageous."
2,Pretty disappointed...,"I'm glad I ordered Marie Claire while it was just $5.00 for two years. Because of that, reading the first issue wasn't as painful as it could have been. It was still definitely painful, though.Wow, this magazine is full of ads. Every other page - and in some places every page for five pages! There isn't much substance to the magazine and it literally took me all of ten minutes to finish ""reading"" the whole thing. No useful articles, nothing but ads and pictures of frightening looking and rather gaunt women. Yes, fashion magazines are full of those...but some of these women looked just sick! It pained me to look at them. Toward the front of the magazine, there is one shot of three models in the middle of a page and they literally look like aliens. So thin and starving their heads look two times too big. Poor girls. That being the only thing that stuck out in a decent sized magazine...that's pathetic."
1,Promotes hatred towards people of size!,"After a nasty hate filled blog post on Marie Claire's website, I will no longer subscribe to this publication until their editor and the author of the blog post are dismissed!"
2,Top journalistic achievement...NOT...,"""How to Make a Baby Without Loosing Your Guy"", ""My Father the Fraudster"", ""I Was a High Functioning Alcoholic"" are only a few of the disturbing titles from the July edition of Marie Claire, a (fashion?) magazine about 40% devoted to advertisements. The articles behind the titles are something an intern might have scribbled on her ciggie break from a more serious assignement (such as a coffee run). As for the few ""fashion"" layouts: July magazine received in June, with fashions for the fall (which, in my climate, does not start until Nov/December)...Still, some of the photographs may eventually prove to be worth the five bucks I paid for a year's subscription...Oh, how sad..."
3,Marie Claire Had Better Days,"I used to be an avid fan of Marie Claire magazine, but over the last few years its gotten thinner and poorer in quality content. What used to be in-depth articles about real women, now they have wise-guy(or er girl) ""essays"" with minimal to zero relevance to the topic. Even their fashion and beauty sections lost quality. They used to give you a lot of useful fashion information for every woman, like figure flattery tips, splurge vrs steal. But now its just a mish-mash of clothes that aren't even stylish. Sure they have a few articles about women around the world, but most of the content in the magazine could be forgotten. I would recommend this magazine for those looking for pure entertainment, but not for those looking for relevant information."
4,Received Quickly - But I only received 1 year,"Received very quickly ( not like People Style which I never received).The magazine is fashion foward, with a celeb interview scattered thoughout.From memory, 2 years were $5 -- how can you go wrong ??Update --I only received 1 year"
2,More about other clubs than about Studio 54,"I was quite disappointed in this book, which seemed to go on forever. I was hoping it would be stories about out-of-control celebrities, and the decadance of the 80's, but the book was really about club owner fighting, how they network with each other, how they finance clubs, how they skim some profits, etc.The book wasn't really about the people who went to these clubs, but rather about the owners and people who organized the parties, which quite frankly, isn't all that interesting. Even the pictures wern't very good.Furthermore, the timeline in the book wasn't honored. It constantly went back and forth, and it was difficult to get a grasp of how things happened chronologicaly."
4,A time when Condoms were OPTIONAL ....,"I was there and this book IS 54 ! The bathrooms upstairs had alot of stories to tell as did the catwalk over the dance floor, I wish they got further into the ""dirt"" , The Basement also had alot more to tell, should have gone deeper! A good read for those of us that wish we could go back to a time when we were ""young & dumb""...The medical word was that ""Cocaine was NOT addictive"" and Quaaludes were a sleeping pill..... What a great place , lots of fun..needed more PICTURES !"
5,Great piano method,"Scott has come up with a piano method for those who want to play their favorite non-classical tunes, as an Instructional Designer it is intriguing to see the simplicity to remove many learning obstacles with the intent that you will practice while you play your favorite music. There is an axiom that says ""whats learned with pleasure is learned full measure."" This is a great example of how to have fun playing the piano quickly."
2,Same as book....a lot more expensive,"This DVD is pretty much verbatim from the book of the same title. In other words, there is very little substantive content. Houston is a marketer of hope and dreams, not an instructor of the keyboards. The mantra of ""play chords with your left hand, and melody with the right"" will get you nowhere. Get a good book and take your time. Playing piano is not easy; it requires practice. Houston would have you believe that you can play like a pro. Don't fall for it."
1,Depression era movie - quite depressing!,Quality of tape was not good. Didn't think I would be able to view it at first. Love Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson. They did a great job of depressing me!
4,Great Suspense!,"This movie was scary but teaches everyone important lessons, while encouraging Sally Field as she goes after her daughter's killer. And I also love Ed Harris!"
4,Works for us,"I picked this game up at a store because it was on sale. Got home and read reviews...almost returned it. Glad I didn't because it actually works very well for my kids. My daughter (4) and son (2 1/2) both love it and can always make a ""basket"" within about 4 tries. My kids were actually better at it than my husband and myself! Granted, we have to center the doggy for them so they're lined up to flip the ants, but I don't mind that. Definitely wasn't too difficult for them."
5,Vintage game still fun to play!,Vintage game still fun to play! Bought this form my older kids to remember from childhood. Still fun and cute! Good price arrive quickly I would recommend this seller!~
4,The Big True Blue (The French/Global Original Version),"This is the orignal, original soundtrack-like it or not !Conti's score was chosen for American audiences. Maybe I'm just a biased Eric Serra fan. Serra composes, produces, and performs some of the most remarkable soundtrack scores (The Fifth Element, La Femme Nikita, The Professional) around.Also, any Luc Besson (director) fans know that Besson has utilized Serra's musical services for most of his films... Though, he is not exactly Vangelis or John Williams he is still a highly creative artist in his own right ! No, I have not heard the American Conti version, so I cannot compare and contrast scores. However, to insult Serra's craftsmanship, by calling it a ""wrong"" or ""so-so"" soundtrack could be nothing further from the truth.Serra's version is serene,majestic, and a bit jazz-like at times. This ""version"" is highly recommended..."
2,Great if you want the Eric Serra Soundtrack - NOT if you want the Bill Conti,"This soundtrack is fine if you are looking for the Eric Serra Soundtrack - that's the soundtrack to the French Version of the film as well as the new Director's Cut Version (which is the only version available on DVD).However, if you want the original American Version Soundtrack by Bill Conti from the original American release of the film in the late 80's (which in my humble opinion is WAY better than the Director's cut which gives too much info and takes away from some of the mystique), then you will have to search elsewhere. I do not think there's a way to find it on CD, but YOU CAN FIND it for Download!!! For years it was unavailable, but it's out there now. Just search for ""Bill Conti The Big Blue"" or ""Bill Conti Le Grande Bleu"" on yahoo or google and you will find a couple of sites that have Bill Conti's beautiful score! Enjoy!"
2,cd,When I got this cd I thought it was the music from the first version and that is the main reason I bought it. Its an ok cd just not my taste in music.
5,Can't go wrong with Zakk,"If you want good music, just search for stuff that Zakk plays on and you won't be let down....ever. Zakk adds balls to everything he does. He could take a Yanni song and make it good. Zakk is the soul of hard rock!! Don't waste your money on the Japanese import like I did. It is just a backwards version of the song ""Speedball"" that is already on this CD. However, if you buy Stronger than Death, you must pay the $$$ for the extra track. It is well worth it."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge Zakk Wylde Fan. I've bought most of the stuff he's done (Ozzy, P&G, Book of Shadows, BLS etc) and this past year has seen him thrust in the spotlight thanks to recent outings with Ozzy and the Rock Star film. Thus I was very surprised to hear a new BLS album was in the works. I think he's bitten off more than he can chew on this one unfortunately. With all this work going on, something had to suffer. This album , to me, lacks the depth that Zakk has shown us in the past, with the songs not really having any great hooks, riffs or solos. And what's going on with sound.....even with my amps' treble controls turned right down, where the hell is the bass...???For the sake of sticking up for Zakk and jumping on the bandwagon, I'm giving this the thumbs down. I know what he's capable of, and I'm sure he felt he needed to make this album. Next time bud, take your time. Quality outways quantity in most peoples books."
1,Sounds bloody awful!,"This album is appalling! Zakk Wylde can't sing at all and the vocals sound terrible. Sure, he's a great guitar player, but he really should ask somebody else to sing. This album is a blatant Led Zeppelin rip off, Jimmy Page was doing the same stuff 30 years ago and doing it 10 times better. The guitar playing also reminds me a lot of early Def Leppard, and perhaps Aerosmith."
3,INACCURATE INFORMATION,THIS VIDEO DOES NOT HAVE KIM NOVAK IN IT FOR THOSE OF YOU LOOKING FOR KIM NOVAK MOVIES.
4,Sinatra - The Actor,"Firstly I'll presume your a Sinatra fan or you would'nt be looking at this Dvd.Secondly I will further presume you hav'nt heard much about this film, maybe never even heard of it before, am I right......Well relax and get this film, its one of those rare films in which Sinatra showed all the disbelievers he could act. A gritty drama, probably better because it was shot in black and white and O.K, its not as good a quality print as some of todays films would be but this genuinely adds to the feel of the movie.As anyone who has seen the laserdisc will testify this is a very good watch and a must for all real Frank Sinatra fans."
3,A great actor in a mediocre film,"One more of these films with Frank Sinatra that is entirely carried by the main actor. The situation, the attempt to assassinate the President in the little town of Suddenly, is dramatic for sure but the plot is too loose to be believable. But the acting of Frank Sinatra as a killer, born to kill, and all his ambiguities, dilemmas and other self-righteous contradictions, gives to the film some credibility. It is surprising that Frank Sinatra accepted to play in such films where his talent was wasted on incongruous and incredible scenarios. He could have been a better remembered actor in films that would have had some real depth.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,Excellent Restoration of Sinatra Classic,"Long in the public domain, ""Suddenly"" (1954) provides Frank Sinatra with one of his finest dramatic roles in this low-budget noir thriller. Ol' Blue Eyes makes the most of his villainous portrayal, with solid work from Sterling Hayden and James Gleason. Taut direction by Lewis Allen does justice to Richard Sale's memorable screenplay. Made during a time when Sinatra actually cared about his movies. After years of poor-quality dupes, Legend Films offers the best available DVD release. Needless to say, the excellent black-and-white restoration is preferable to the colorized version."
4,Good game,"This is a very cool game for kids learning basic math. It's fun, and it's very simple. My husband complains about some of the rules, like that on some of the chance cards you can just ""take"" people properties. But he is a die hard real Monopoly player. I believe it is very suitable for children."
3,Don't waste the time,"My children, ages 6 & 8, found this game boring and much prefer the regular ""grown up"" version."
4,Fun but...,"This game is fun, but tends to get a little bit old waiting for someone to run out of money. I would get it again though, my kids like it for a while, we just usually end it on our own."
1,Shipped a different version!!!!,"This product is advertised as the Monopoly Junior edition where players buy properties at an amusement part, but the vendor shipped a different product: Monopoly Junior Party. As Rick Perry might say, ""oops."""
2,Could be helpful - if you can get through it,"I read this book right behind ""The Accidental Salesperson"" by Chris Lytle (which I recommend). I felt that this book was too long-winded and too ""techie"" in its definitions and explanations.The questioning techniques involved here are valid and somewhat useful - if you can wade through chapters that discuss ""multi layed conversation models"" and the like.The author has a background in technical sales - techies worldwide might like this - ""right brain"" salespeople will bog down quickly."
4,Good stuff,I love this movie. Very insightful and interesting. Any yogi and non-yogi can enjoy it. My review isn't long enough.
2,So-so sippys,"The kids don't mind them, but I would pass if I had it to do over.These get realllly stinky when you put milk in them, and I am not convinced the thermos action does anything to keep the milk any colder. Washing them ia a real pain, they don't seem to snap together all the way when reassembling, and they still smell like sour milk after washing in boiling hot soapy water."
1,very destructible lid,"This sippy cup is great idea and great design. Unfortunately, if your toddler chews on the spout very much at all (and what toddler doesn't have the urge to chew on something nice and soft in her mouth?), you will soon have a hole and eventually the entire top of the spout will be in two pieces. And there are apparently no replacement parts. Bummer. Otherwise, it's fabulous, but with a broken spout, pretty unusable."
3,"Keeps drinks cold for hours, but leaks after serious use","I love the principle of this sippy, it keeps my daughter's milk cold enough for a 4 hour trip shopping so I'm not worried about warm/spoiled milk. However after using the sippy cup everyday for about 2-3 weeke it began to seriously leak, mainly from the smaller hole making the cup useless. I still use it on trips to town, so to that end it still fills the need, however as an everyday cup it's not the best.Some people have commented on the 4 part lid being difficult to assemble, which baffles me. If you've ever used a sippy with a valve in it you can manage this. I just pull all the pieces apart and put everything in the top rack of the dishwasher for cleaning, with no issues."
1,Cup Leaks,I have had this cup for over 4 months and the majority of the time it leaks. I am very disappointed with this product especially after spending so much on it. I have disassembled and reassembled the parts of the lid numerous times to try and get it to stop leaking but it seems to have a mind of its own. Don't waste your money on this cup.
2,Bought 2 but they both leak!!!,I wanted very badly to like this sippy cup. The first one seemed to leak immediately. Liquid doesn't pour out but there is a small trickle if its not sitting up. I have taken it apart and reassembled it many times to no avail. I even purchased a second thinking I was being dense with putting it together. Nope. It happened again with the second one. I hadn't even taken it apart to make sure and it still leaked. Granted I had to shake it a bit but it shouldn't leak no matter what. Save your money.
2,Stripped on first time use,"Maybe I got a bad one, but this little thing stripped the first time I tried to use it with a socket wrench. It also stripped the Torx Bolt. now I have to get the bolt removed professionally."
4,Laugh-out-loud,"I was on the floor laughing. Very good book from a first timer. All of the characters were well writen. Everything was great, but I would change one thing. Everytime the author would talk about any of the numerous bugs and insects, he would first call it out as the common name, and then by the scientific name in parentheses. If he would have done that just as each new bug was introduced into the book, and then left it to their common names, it would have been the perfect book. He chose to use both through-out the entire book, regardless if he used them in the same paragraph."
2,"Funny, buy not great, plus Fitzhugh has issues","The book is ok. There are certainly good points. The characters are extremely underdeveloped, however, and seem to be mere characatures. They could have been a lot better. The book would definitely be better off as a film.Fitzhugh also has some serious issues with New York City. Unless there was a joke I missed, he must HATE it. He spends 15-20% of the book describing how awful, dirty, and crime-filled it is. All landlords are scummy, all the subway riders are crazy, or dirty, or ""suits."" Cabbies carry guns and will use them, and so does everyone one else. Even if this were still true, it detracts from the book."
2,Not very funny,"I had to review this book because I am a big fan of Tom Robbins. What?, you ask, this isn't a Robbins book. The good folks at Amazon lump these books together(other people who bought this bought...); however, Pest Control is no Jitterbug Perfume. If you are looking for another author with his panache, style, and spirit, you will find none of these things in Pest Control. Now, the premise of P.C. is a decently amusing one, and the possibilities exist for hilarity. Upon delving into the book, I found the subject to be the only funny aspect. The characters are unbelievable, and the situations impossible. By contrast, I believe that all of Tom Robbins fantasies could indeed be reality. Let there be immortality, boundless sexual energy, and tons of kinky, inspired, enlightened people all over the universe. If you love Tom Robbins, spare yourself Pest Control."
4,Read this book now,"This book's cover is what caught my attention and I thought that the synopsis on the back was funny. After I started reading, I could not put it down. Fitzhugh created characters who are off-kilter but that the reader can also identify with. He is like a funnier version of Elmore Leonard."
5,"If All Books Were This Fun, There Would Be No Television","Loved it. Laughed myself silly. A fun, twisted plot with awsome charecters. A must read!"
1,Dumb Book,This book was so boring that i could not finish it. The poor long suffering wife did not seem like any woman i have ever known. The protagonist was only interested in his invention which made him silly and not real either.
3,Romantic Fantasy,"Lush roman a clef with artists from a Wyeth-like family and the English Pre-Raphaelites. It seemed odd at first to have a modern woman authorusing a theme of male artists and writers having their souls and livesdestroyed by dangerously attractive women who lead them into obsessionand madness while they create fascinating art. Even including a womanartist doesn't really alleviate my discomfort with the ""woman as destroyer""theme. The richness of the book, with the Celtic myths, art history, andbizarre characters, makes it well worth reading, however. The shifting timesand generations seemed well-handled, with clear differences in the tone andstyle of the nineteenth century sections vs the 20th century ones. I found ita bit hard to engage with at first, but quite gripping and impossible to put down by the end. I would recommend it to those interested in magical legends, thePre-Raphaelites, and quite different and interesting fantasy stories."
5,Highly recommended,"If you are interested in any aspect of mechanical assemblies, this is the book you must have! This book is very well written, mentioning all the details about assembling. It helped me a lot with my research work. As far as I know, this is the best book in this field."
1,Tiki - Why Have You Failed Me So???,"I so desperately wanted this to be a great movie. I have a tremendous appreciation for what are otherwise considered guilty pleasure horror flicks, i.e,. those that are considered absurd by mainstream, but which I otherwise hesitate to admit my appreciation. Case in point - Killer Pad, Tequila Body Shots, Hallow's End, etc.In this case, polynesia may be the only thing that approaches my passion for horror flicks. Hawaii is by far my absolute favorite place, and so wish the polynesian supper clubs (esp. Kahiki) are as popular now as they were in the 50s. So with this predisposition, I approached this movie not expecting much but really hoping it would have something redeeming. Nope. The absurd plot does not save the c**p production quality, terrible acting, blah blah blah. Avoid, sadly."
4,Fast Getaway is a Winner,"Corey Haim and Leo Rossi team up as a father-son bank robbing duo in this 1990 comedy. Corey Haim is Nelson Potter, a 16 year old kid who just wants what every kid his age wants, girls and money. Except as opposed to getting a job at McDonalds like most high school kids, Nelson robs banks for a living with his old man. Good stunts, great car chases, and solid acting from Corey Haim make this movie a lot better than it should be."
4,Helps Teach Turn Taking-Great for kids with Special Needs!,"When my husband and I started playing this game with my Autistic 4 year old daughter, she wanted to go every time. She quickly learned to wait for her turn, but after a few more rounds, she just wanted to tip over the pot so that she could take all of the beans! I do think with a bit more practice with her daddy and me, she will better understand the concept of the game and be able to play for longer periods of time without getting bored or frustrated."
4,FUn with a 2 1/2 year old,My son loves this game and asks to play it every day. It is great because we practice counting and taking count. The pot is light and does tip over pretty easily but it is fun to just start over and practice more counting.
5,Awesome.,"I bought this helmet for my son. He says it is totally awesome, so I'll take his word for it. He loves it. Also bought the chest armor, which he likes too."
1,Exaclty Who IS This????,"These songs are all very cute and romantic, but where is my RAUNCH? C'mon now, y'all know that even the sweetest, purest, truest love has to have SOME stank in it to work. The voices are still there, but most of this material would be better off with the Backstreet Boyz or O-Town or even The Carpenters. These are real men with real voices-find material that allows them to show that in ALL of it's forms. Please, at least put SOME of that good ole stank a dank dank back in it! I guess they call this maturing, but I call it getting stale-REAL FAST! And that last one ""How Long"" sounds borderline country-WHAT?? Where is DEVANTE SWING????"
3,DERMAdoctor Wrinkle Revenge Antioxidant Enhanced G,"Been using Dermadoctor Wrinkle Revenge cleanser for about two months. I can not notice any difference in my skin since I started using the product. Prior to using this product I used MD Forte for about 10 years, wanted to try something different, will probably go back to MD Forte cleanser."
3,that Derek dude is wrong!,This Movie was about a bumbling fool from Germany who invented a car that can run on vegetables.... needless to say ... what the hell is that guy Derek above talking about... anyway its a time passer
5,Excellent!,"This is the easiest portable hard drive I have ever owned. Plugging right into my mac book via firewire, the computer recognized it without any downloads. It was so easy to drag and drop files, pictures and music onto this storage unit. I use it daily to access my iphoto library which I now keep exclusively on the aegis to save space on my laptop. Highly recommended!!!!"
5,terrific,Best explanation of where we all came from I have ever read. It really helped me understand how Adam and Eve populated the world.
1,JUNK!,The adapter didn't work; well it worked for exactly 1 minute and then that was it. I called the seller to return it and get a replacement and they couldn't help me. Go elsewhere!
5,"Fun game, even young children can play","The cardboard pieces are hard enough that it takes a lot of teething on them to ruin them. THey do not bend easily. My only complaint about the pieces is they are a bit small. The small size makes it a bit difficult for small hands to manipulate them at times.THere are many small pieces so if you loose one or two, you just take the match out of the pile and toss it away too. The game will be just as fun and no one will be the wiser.In fact, when we play with our younger children, we often times just use half of the pieces.THe game is the traditional memory game that almost everyone has played at one point in their life. It develops eye and hand coordination, following rules, taking turns, memory skills, picture skills and more.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
3,This is overall a good thing,"I think that for the average child that this is a good choice. If you have a special needs child (ADD/ADHD) this is really to much and takes to long. It also becomes a problem of the cards bending etc. To bad they are not laminated heavily. I'd pay extra just for the durability so my child could ""grow"" into it"
3,Dwight H. Little's Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers,"This sequel is problably the second best Halloween sequel aside of Halloween II, just as good as H20, and it is certainly better than the stupid sequel Halloween III. It starts practitly where Halloween II left off, Michael Myers gets treatment at Smith's Grove. He escapes and heads back to Haddonfield to kill his his niece, Laurie Strode's daughter Jamie(Danielle Harris) who has been adopted by the Carruthers Family. Can Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasence) stop Michael once more from killing? Rent it and find out find out. Bad Stuff: Michael kills too many people, Most of the people are killed off screen, and Michael Mask is different. It is very freaky at the end when Loomis discovers that Jamie is dressed up in a Clown Costume with scissors in her hand......"
5,One of the best of the series.,Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were amazing in this suprisingly great sequel. The only part that I disliked and thought was funny was when Michael Myers was walking on the roof.
3,"ten years later,dr. lomis is back and as crazy as michael in this pointless,but ok thriller","after ten years and a sequel that didn't work,someone decieded that the time was right to bring back michael mayers one more time. the best thing about this movie is donald pleasence is back as dr. lommis and this time he is as mad as michael is. scared and burned from the last battle with the ""boogyman"" the good doctor is now like capt. ahab looking for moby dick, and just as soon as the movie begins michael, in good shape after being burned alive in II, escapes and heads home again. with ms. curtis not involved, we find her ""laure"" is dead and her daughter living with family in haddonfield. now michael wants her to die.at 88 mins. long this is short and that keeps the movie from draging and really helps this movie be better than it should be. all in all not the worst in the series!"
2,"It's not that bad of a movie, it's just....","This movie actually isn't even that bad and I probably could have given it 3 stars but I have a problem with this series of movies and other series like Jason or Freddy. The same thing always happens! The vilain is invincible and just never dies! He gets shot, blown up, then goes on vacation for the 3rd one, and in this one he's back, and gets shot a hundred billion times. It isn't realistic! How is this scary? What's scary about a crazy killer who keeps on getting killed over and over again and then just comes back to life? If you want to be scared, don't rent movies like this, rent classic Hitchcock or Hannibal Lecter movies. This is a terrible excuse of a horror movie."
3,OKAY,THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT SO I BOUGHT IT AND WATCHED IT AND FOUND IT KINDA BAD.I WAS COLLECTING ALL THE MICHAEL MYERS MOVIES SO I COULD HAVE THEM ALL AND I GOT THEM ALL NOW THAT I BOUGHT THAT ONE SO IT WAS WORTH BUYING
3,It's Good,"This is probably easily the best in the still going series of Halloween slasher films. Michael Meyers returns as the unstoppable killer in this well acted, predictable stalk and slash film. It's only rival for best sequel in this series is the sixth entry which explains Meyers' origins."
2,A little better than part 5,This was the first halloween i saw in the theater.Watching all the films and owning all of them makes this entry a little dull now.It doesn't compare with the first 2 an h2o.
3,Not the worst in the series,"Taking place ten years after Michael Myers terrorized Laurie Strode, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is the first film in the Halloween series to not have anything to do with creator John Carpenter. After the backlash at Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, Carpenter abandoned the series because he didn't want to see it become a series of recycled slasher films a la Friday the 13th. In this installment Myers awakes from a coma after it is revealed that he has a surviving niece, and yes, you guessed it, Mike goes on a bloody rampage killing anyone who comes in his way. Donald Pleasence also returns as Dr. Loomis and adds a great presence to the film as the slightly mad doctor trying to bring an end to Myers' reign of terror. Although the film is not without it's flaws, and Carpenter's stylistic presentation is sorely missed, Halloween 4 is one of the better installments in the series."
4,Epitome of slasher film excellence!,"Halloween 4 broke no new ground, and offered few surprises as to what would happen. What it did do, was follow the rules perfectly. The movie was finely acted by it's stars, especially young Fisher. The music was intense as usual, the characters were colorful, and the scares were genuine. Gore galore. As a college student I can tell you this is one movie that is almost always watched at least once a week."
3,"""Myers lives...!""","This is a fair sequel, but a little bit odd. The second movie took place an hour after the first, so they should have made that all just one movie. Then, Halloween III comes up short when we find out it has nothing to do with Myers or Laurie Strode, etc. And finally, we get Halloween 4, where Michael has given up on his sister and goes after his neice, Jamie Loyd. The ending to this one was really scary, and the end climax was pretty entertaining, but there is about a twenty-minute stretch here that doesn't have Myers in it. Myers wastes his time spying on his victims, but Jason just hauls off and slaughters 'em before they can blink. The acting was pretty good. As with the rest, the Halloween theme, composed by John Carpenter, is here. I say rent this one first, but even if you buy it, you're not wasting any money."
3,The night he came BACK,"Halloween 4 :The Return Of Michael Myers was a really great film.I wouldn't say it fits the rankings of Halloween(the first one) but it is suitable for any movie fan weather that be horror or not. Michael has been unconsious for 10 years and on one Halloween night he comes back after finding out he has a niece living in his home town.Surise ,suprise , he wants to kill her and anybody who gets in his way.I think the killing parts could have been a whole lot bloodier.Thats what bought the movie down.One part he sends a shot gun right through this girl's body.(NO BLOOD!!!)..i mean come on now.That's a little corney don't you think?! and the part where he climbs a moving truck and throughs men off it but no1 hears that!!put it this way..Halloween 4 was a great film but i've seen better."
2,"Not really ""Halloween"" type","Well I suppose this movie was alright, but the atmosphere just wasn't Halloween! This movie portrays Halloween as some little country hick filled town, which was very dumb. The redneck hillbillies were also stupid! This movie just doesn't start out with a story at all and I found it to be a major dissapointment."
1,"""Cashing In On A Classic""","The original ""Halloween""--the film directed by John Carpenter, was is an immortal classic; ""Halloween 4,"" on the other hand, reeks in it's use of cliches, tired old plot contrivances, an offensively young heroine, and too little imagination to make a third installment feasible. The new Sheriff of Haddonfield is a cartoon characterization of Wyatt Earp; Michael is built like Arnold Swarzenneger, and behaves more like Jason in the ""Friday The 13th"" Movies. The film has one redeeming merit--it is an excellent showcase for Donald Pleasance's talents, because he carries the entire movie. One wonders how, and why this loser was produced in the first place, although the answer is painfully obvious--money."
4,Halloween 4,Gran continuacion una de mis peliculas favoritas de halloweenla historia todo muy bien y en todo caso la pelicula no decepciona.
5,The Return Of Michael Myers,"To be honest, when I was younger (I'm eleven) when I was probaby nine, I never really saw the Halloween Movies. This had the be the first Halloween I saw, and it had scenes that are gems and scary sequences that shouldn't end. It scares me and I watch that movie every time it came on TV, and it seems pretty edited in a fair way. But when I watched it on DVD, it seems the same to me. This movie had a good plot: JAMIE, the daughter and relative of Laurie Strode is going trick o' treating one Halloween night with her babysitter who Laurie also babysat, the beauty RACHEL. They are off on Halloween, aware of their surroundings because Michael Myers, Jamie's uncle, can be anywhere, holding that knife and slashing all the naked people (did I say naked people? There's a blonde that gets naked and she gets killed - so right). As evil lurk the streets, this is the most dangerous night or the bloodiest night of all.Watch it / it's worth it"
3,If your a hardcore Halloween fan watch it but if not you'll think it sucks,"This movie is way too predictable and just the same as many other sequels. It lacks the unknown tension that the original has. But on the upside you get a good but breif sex scene and some funny deaths and a good opening scene.I thought it was alright. Like I said before, if you're a hradcore Halloween fan watch it but if not you''l think it sucks. Thats all it boils down to."
4,"He's Back!!! - ""HALLOWEEN 4 - THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS""","GREAT!After the horrible Halloween III - Season of the Witch (1983), this series needed a jump-start. This is what it got. Carpenter is gone from the series but Moustapha Akkad (master of the Halloween franchise) manages to put forth a solid film. Picking up ten years after the Haddonfield incident, Halloween 4 follows ""the shape"", masked-maniacle killer Michael Myers, as he terrorizes his young niece, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). Jamie is the daugher of the now-deceased Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Also in the movie is Dr. Sam Loomis, again played by the wonderful Donald Pleasance. Pleasance gives his usual top-notch performance as the doctor who forsaw the horror. If you're looking for something good to watch, give Halloween 4: The Revenge of Michael Myers a chance. It is definitely one of the better sequels."
3,Good sequel,"This fourth entry in the Halloween series is one of the better sequels. This time Michael is after his young niece and everyone who gets in his way wish they hadn't.For the most part this film is very atmospheric and chilling. Director Little obviously has respect for this genre and builds up some terrific suspense. It goes a little downhill for the finale as Michael's ability to teleport himself (seems that way) stretches credibility a bit too far. But a big plus for shock ending, pity nr. 5 didn't go from there."
3,"Good movie, good ending, bad sequel","The movie was pretty good, the story was pretty good, the ending was pretty good. But they weren't as good as the original. I loved the ending, but they had to screw it up by saying Michael had some kind of ""mind control"" powers."
1,Enjoy it quickly!,"The mechanism that holds ""Daddy"" in bed and then releases him is a tiny, flimsy tab of plastic. It is so shoddy that after ONE EVENING of playing the game it was worn beyond repair. That works out to about $5.00 per hour of use. What a rip-off!"
5,"I remember this game, but never played it.","I wanted to play Don't wake daddy in when I was in elementary school, but I couldn't because one of my classmates cheated. Which was very stupid."
1,Terrible Toy,"First of all.. After I purchased the product I found it for less than half of what I paid for it on Amazon. Secondly, there was no return information inside the box.Third and most importantly, on Christmas Eve when I gave it to my 3 year old grandson and we all got on the floor to play with it... It didnt work"
4,Great Fun!,"I gave my six year old this for her birthday. She, her seven year old sister and I have great fun playing this together. No reading is required, but it is still fun for older children and adults. Waiting for Daddy to ""pop"" up is exciting. Highly recommended."
1,this is ridiculous,"we received the package in good time, but did not check the contents. The game was described as collectible excellent condition but the cards were destroyed and the game board was for ""candyland""!"
3,Macworld magazine,I purchased this mag for my Son and he is happy with it. I would not buy it for myself as I prefer the stability of Linux.
3,Good Magazine - gotten smaller?,I love this Magazine...but it seems to have gotten smaller in content in the last year or so...I like Mac Life better now.
5,Amazing album that grows every listen,"In their 22 years of making music, The Church have released one of their finest albums to date. After Everything, Now This is simply a beautiful album. These 10 songs will take you to another place. It is one of those magical CD's which just grows and grows on you until you discover that the CD has grown roots and refused to leave the CD player. Things kick off with 'Numbers', the first single from the album, a rollicking and great song. Following are one gorgeous song after another, with layered guitars and mystical lyrics. If you like good music, buy the CD, put it in, turn it up, and prepare to smile."
3,stuck in 2nd gear,"There are some good songs on this CD...but all in all, it never really takes off. Almost every song has the same pace, so if you listen to it from start to end, it can be quite tedious at times. I'll still go see them live, but I think the CD could have used a couple of faster-paced songs to liven it up."
3,"looks good, but less functionality than I expect from Oggi","It looks nice. It does a poor job dispensing. It's difficult to load, and anyone getting one, is bound to touch the others. It doesn't hold that many."
3,Giant scissors,"This is a useful prop for staging any photo of a ribbon cutting or other event where an oversize object adds viewer value. I don't know how it might be used as a ""toy"" or in other educational applications. The price is right...and about 5% of what metal scissors cost."
5,Fave pencils,"When shipped by Amazon, they were missing a few pencils among arrival. Amazon quickly replaced them. Thanks Amazon!These are my favorite, go-to pencils as I sketch with these. The 0.5 lead is not too thick and doesn't snap/ break like some thin pencils. They come in multiple colors."
3,"Boring, nothing interesting","I rated this game for my 4.5 years old son. He thinks it is a very boring game. He just put together a bug and played with that bug for a while, then he was done with the game and put it aside."
5,Great Game for Preschoolers,"This is a great game for Preschoolers. They learn to take turns, learn colors, and learn the count. And they can use their imagination!!! I remember having this game has a child and I am sure that my son will love it too!!!!"
4,Simple and Fun Game,"This game is very simple because you just roll the dice and grab the parts you need when you roll the right number, but you can still make it educational. I use it for number recognition by having my girls tell me what number the dice is showing, and I use it for colors as well. It is a great game."
3,"okay game, but can drag on forever","The idea of the game is fun, but since you have to roll a 1 first, then a 2 in order to play it can drag on forever getting no where, which is very frustrating for 3 & 4 year olds. We are going to try playing with more than one dice to see if that helps speed the game up & prevents frustration in all of us."
2,breaks immediately,"Although my kids really liked this game, a bunch of the legs broke almost immediately and when the bug is put together, parts continuously fall off. Not well made at all and ultimately ended up in the trash."
3,Frustrating but fun,"My kids (2 and 4) just got this from their grandma. My 4-yr-old enjoys playing it, but gets frustrated because many of the pieces keep falling out. My 2-yr-old gets too frustrated to bother playing the game. He just likes to build the cooties without actually playing the game. Overall they enjoy it, but I am very disappointed with the quality. Then again, what can you expect for $7??"
2,"Cute bugs, poor game...","There are many early board games that are so much better than this one. (Hi Ho Cherry-O is one of my favorites.) The object is to roll a die to collect the cootie parts to put one together. You have to get the body first, which means you spend the first several turns waiting for a certain number. Many preschoolers will be bored before they even get started. Also, the legs go in at an awkward angle and my four-year-old is frequently frustrated when he can't do it himself and when they fall out again. I'd have given it one star, but the bugs are cute. You might have some fun playing with them if you don't actually try to play the game."
1,Cheap,I bought this for when my 3 yr old nephew comes to play. I was excited because I remember it from my past. The pieces are so cheap. The heads wont stay on so you are constantly re-attatching them and the legs are impossible for a 3 year old to get on. The ears and eyes are now one piece so you are basically waiting mostly for the number six. Just another kids toy cheapened and can't stay together.... it's very aggravating!
2,Pieces Fall Out,"I believe the game is fun but the pieces would not stay together. The head, body, legs, and antennae would keep falling off. This frustrated my children because they had to keep putting the pieces together after they already put them on and so it took the enjoyment out of the game. My children is 3 and 4 years old and my nephew is 6 years old."
3,"A wonderful overview, but it did not meet my own hopes","""Flag"" is a wonderful overview of many of the aspects and much of the history associated with our Stars and Stripes. It is an easy read and filled with information that should be part of high school American History courses.But, it did not meet my own hopes. As I am already versed in much of the flag's general history, I was only impressed by the book's discussion of the Pledge of Allegiance. I was hoping for a more concrete history of star patterns and so forth, and I certainly wanted more information about the period between the War of 1812 and the Civil War. I guess, for once, I wanted something more academic.Still, I would recommend this book because it has some well-told stories and also dispells many myths (including that of Betsy Ross). It is a well-written quick read, and I think that it covers a lot of the issues that still relevant to today's political climate."
4,Good Overall,The price was right and this is a good DVD. Overall I would not have paid full price but for the discounted price it was worth it.
2,What the?,"I'm trying hard to read this book but the characters are so stupidly implausible that I don't know if I can bother to continue.We have the typical rich, handsome tycoon who runs into (literally) the typical gorgeous woman in a hotel hallway. The minute he sees her he starts begging her to marry him. Oh, shut up! He talks her into having a drink, then spends the whole evening getting drunk (trying to impress her) while simultaneously begging her to marry him. When he wakes up the next morning (in her apartment), he immediately begins begging her to marry him again. She's so amused and continues to play hard to get, and I'm so bored out of my mind at this point that I can't believe I paid for this!Good luck."
4,original issue,"Although the interaction between the characters is a bit dated, the book does contain the classic strong heroine and danger elements that make her books so much fun."
3,Dated but still a fun story,"There are holes, but that is to be expected with re-prints of older novels. However, despite the dated feeling I got when I originally read this story, I really enjoyed Hooper's characterizations and the way she twists her stories into enjoyable rollercoaster-style mysteries!"
3,"Good concept, lacks versatility","As a game, spelling primer, and spelling practice ""free for all,"" this is overall a good value for money (shop around: $5 - $15 range is out there). A couple of BIG downsides when using the letter cubes for anything other than the supplied cards: 1) many simple words cannot be formed because needed letters are on the same cube, 2) all letters are not represented (not ""cool"" when your child can't even spell out his own name), very limited 3 & 4 word cards (trim 3x5 index cards to supply your own cards, but make sure the word can be spelled with the provided blocks!) It would be nice to have additional letter cubes available, especially to have all the letters!"
1,A waste of money,"This is NOT a game. At most, it is a manipulative teaching tool for letters and how, when assembled in a particular order, they form words. We were VERY disappointed. We thought we were buying a game that would provide us with a fun way to incorporate learning of letters and words. All this does is have the child look for the letters that match those in the word on the card. No game, no fun. We used it once. It now collects dust on my shelf. I should have immediately returned it for a refund. Don't waste your money! As a homeschooling mom, trust me, it's a waste."
5,Awsome Kitchen Appliance,"My family of 3 had been looking for something to use for cooking chicken, fish and beef - we heard many people say they used a Ronco Rotisserie so I finally bought one. What a great way to cook, so easy and clean-up is quick and best of all the food tastes wonderful."
3,Concrete Dunes,"Being a huge Grandaddy fan I couldn't help but buy this album. I assume anyone considering purchasing this cd already has the three proper Grandaddy LPs. If not get those first. They are all brilliant. If you still need a grandaddy fix after those buy ""Broken down comforter collection"". It is essentially the same disk as this missing a couple of tracks. I know what you're thinking, if there's less tracks why get bdcc instead? The reason why is that concrete dunes was released without grandaddy's permission (as opposed to bdcc) and the extra couple of tracks aren't worth selling your soul to some evil record company exec. That said all the songs are grandaddelicious so you won't be dissapointed if you do purchase."
1,"I only got one magazine, still awaiting for the rest",I am dissapointed at the fact that I only got one magazine. I am gonna try again.I wonder what happened to my money
2,Review of Men's Health,"Renewing this magazine is a mistake, as all the info is recycled over time. Nothing really new after you've received it for a year."
3,Good articles; gets repetitive,"The information and workouts are good. But it starts getting old after about 6 issues. Also, more advertisements per sq. inch of page than any magazine I have ever read. It's why I got a free subscription from Amazon a couple of years ago and it is renewed for free each year."
1,"Barely a ""Health"" magazine anymore","I used to enjoy this magazine, but it has gone downhill. Rather than ""Health"" the magazine's focus has become getting women to bed, sex, and fashion. The title of the magazine should be changed to ""Men's Fashion"" or ""Playboy"". If you want a fashion magazine, there is already GQ. The magazine cover usually tries to portray ""muscle"" type articles, and there are articles on working out, but the focus on ""Health"" is very limited."
1,a month later....I still haven't received a single issue,"Can't really tell you how the magazine is...still haven't received a single issue. If you order magazines, be prepared to not see them for about 2 months, which makes this magazine an odd gift to give."
2,"sad to agree with ""sad demise""","I wish it wasn't so, but it is. ""Sad demise"" hit the nail on the head. I used to be a faithful subscriber and even gave annual subscriptions to my 2 sons and son-in-law for Christmas. One by one they have asked me to drop or change the subscription. While there are still a few worthwhile items in each issue, the erosion of value is swift. Dittos on Greg Gutfeld too, I really miss his contributions."
4,Men's Health Helped Me,"Two years ago I was 285 lbs. At 5'8"", that was morbidly overweight as my doctor would write on his checklist of me.I made a conscious decision to change myself. I read Men's Health and followed the articles' suggestions. I followed the eating lifestyle they suggested. I exercised using various exercise they suggested.Eventually, I bought the ""Book of Muscle"" they also published.Today I am 160lbs and fit. Playing baseball, playing with my kids.Men's Health is filled with great articles about fitness, health, healthy eating, exercise, sex, etc... I only gave it four stars since there is generally a good portion of fluff in there that I don't read. For example, I really don't care to know what drinks attract women at a bar. But if you pass over the fluff and read the substance, and actually DO some of the things they suggest, you can look like the guy on the cover.Like anything else in life, nothing is free, hard work and dedication are required."
5,Lucid and wise. Proves Burroughs was a genius.,A must read for anyone interested in William S. Burroughs. In 'The Adding Machine' he offers his opinions and wisdom to the reader in a much easier to understand form than he does with his fiction. Try this book before 'Naked Lunch'.
5,Best of it's type,Excellent book! Best of it's type. The operator's manual they didn't give you at your child's birth.
2,"A Gift for someone else, so don't know","Reviewed several; this is what I chose for a friend, who, gasp, had no medical books, w/two young children to raise. We all need a little help."
4,THE FUTURE OF HIP HOP HAS GONE TO THE TOILET.,"dungMeistergeneRal is the most poignant emcee I've heard in a long time. I borrowed this CD from my boyfriend and have since paid him for it. The lyrics are blazing hot and the tracks are unlike anything being forced on us by mainstream.Hip-Hop/Rock/Techno???? My favorites are ""Worshipful Master"" some old evil empire emcee stuff. ""I'm all that & your not"" Hip hop lounge lizard. ""Unresolved childhood issues"" child abuse and cartoons.""Handsome like a monkey"" & ""T.E.O.T.W.A.W.K.I"" are instant classics. Me and my man both have copies now but I almost know all the words. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves when artist push the envelope."
5,Great songs well chosen and brilliantly performed!,"Kathy Mar has been singing all her life, and this has got to be her best album yet. Her voice effortlessly encompasses a whole range of moods and styles, from blues to folk to jazz and back again. There are songs here to chill you, to make you laugh, to make you think and to make you cry. The musical performances are excellent, the production and arrangements faultless, and the words are so clear you don't even need a lyric sheet. Buy this CD. You won't regret it."
3,Good - but some rough spots,"This makes the bibliography process easier, however if you need to delete references or change them around while writing, the program can give you a big hassle. I've had a couple of situations that ended with me having to type my own bibliography up by hand because the program wouldn't let me change what I needed to change. I also find that t seems to be fussier about making changes when using APA format than when using JAMA or NEJM formats."
3,Bought for hamster,"I got this leash thinking it would fit my hamster perfectly, it didn't. My hamster could slip out of it very easily without effort( I have a large Syrian hamster). Plus its hard to put a hamster in this because they are so wild! It looks very nice thought. The leash it comes with is very stretch and i like it. Also the harness has a bell on it! The fabric is great and it is adjustable. This small size perfect for a ferret or rat. A meduim would fit a guinea pig or a small bunny and large would fit a large bunny. I have even heard people use this for dogs! I would buy medium for any xsmall dog though."
1,Do NOT buy this unless you love hatred and family fighting,"Sure I loved my 70's battleship game, but this electronic take on it is utterly useless and horribly designed.First off, there is a major factory flaw: You can't input the coordinates for your ships, the computer voice keeps saying ""incorrect.""The internet verifies this. Everyone has this problem. Therefore, the whole purpose of having an electronic version of the game is null and void.So now you can only play it ""traditional"" style. OK- That's fine. But wait, the product is wretchedly designed that it falls while you play itand the covers for the peg storage compartments fall right off and the scatter little parts everywhere, ready for your baby to choke onand your feet to step on. I just played this with my son and we now hate each other. Thanks a lot, Hasbro."
3,Asia,2 Disk greatest hits. They don't have that many hits. Well in the U.S.Maybe 5 songs are worthy.
1,Torture not diet!,"The only things you can eat on this diet is fruits and vegitables and whole grains. No fat, no processed food of any kind, no meat...... The guide in the back even discourages fat-free dressing for your salads. The only food you can have at a fast food resturant is salad w/out dressing. This is too extream of a way to eat for very long."
4,"This is a good read, interesting and entertaining","On par with his previous big case (which was called NOBODY ROOTS FOR GOLIATH) The Bomber Hansen character is entertaining and keeps things moving. His son as always, is the pavement pounder. The Wanns disease is a allusion to aids with a different twist. I read it in a few nights and enjoyed it."
5,great travel version of popular game,"We purchased this for use on our family vacation with our 3 children. They love the full-sized game that we have at home. The travel game is easily small enough to fit in a carry-on bag. It seems sturdy so far, although we have bent a few of the cards. The names on the cards are a bit small, and you have to occasionally look closely at the cards to make out some of the finer details (mustache, eyeglasses, etc.). Overall, a great learning game and perfect for travel. I almost think that this travel version is more sturdy than the original version because the cards don't fall out of the holders as easily as in our full-sized version. We were also able to play this game on a turbulent airplane without anything falling over, spilling on the floor, or getting lost. Highly recommend,especially if your kids like this game."
1,this book is crap,"this book is is crap. I am a Chemistry major and I understand the equations and relations very well, but when I first used this book in my general chemistry classes, it was a waste of my time. The book consists mainly of short examples and the book does not help to understand the relation of the equations. Also, the book as many errors. Because there are errors, you assume that every answer is possibly wrong and that you are doing the work wrong. The errors also do not help when you do have the correct answer. The authors will change the answers and will not inform you as to how they go the answer. If you are taking a Chemistry class and this book is the requirement, I suggest you talk to your professor or use another book for reference, this book is a tragedy."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!,I melt into heavy metal bliss when I listen to ANY of Zakk Wylde and this album is no different. My friends and I party till the sun comes out to this stuff. This is what real metal sounds like. Get all his cd's and just rock the hell out!!!!!!!!!!
4,Scrabble as a learning tool,"Unfortunately, I can not be specific as to the effectiveness of the game: I gave it to a 13 year old who is non-committal about whether he still plays it. He has a Play Station that absorbs more attention than a game he plays with others. Not a good commentary on the state of present society, when solitarily watching figures on a minuscule screen is more entertaining than building words and interacting with peers"
5,READ,Great Game I purchased it for a teacher and her classroom to play when they can't go outside. They like it.
4,Scrabble Crossword Puzzle,it is really a puzzle. i gave this as a gift to my sister for christmas. she plans to play with her friends with it and beat them.
2,scrabble board,The scrabble board was titled collectors game.However it came with no pieces so I haven't played it yet. I will have to order them separately.
4,review from a teacher,This is a great learning tool for teaching children how to read. It helps them understand how to add on a word or use an existing letter to create new ones.
5,Fantastic book,"The Pullman Case is a very well written account of the American Railway Union strike. Despite the seemingly dry material, the author manages to be concise and makes otherwise bland events quite entertaining. I highly recommend this book for gaining an appreciation of the historical underpinnings of the battle between labor and capital in America."
2,Pretty but not too functional,"The tie clip was beautiful, but, did not work too well as a tie clip due to it not clinging on tight enough to the tie."
3,Great Movie,I enjoy watching Gangster movies and this one was good in comparison to watching Gotti(HBO)Movie
5,Excellent product!,"If you are searching for the perfect guards choose this nones, i just love it! They fit perfect to my skates!..and the color is super cool. Super recommended"
3,No instructions!,"These ice skate guards seem like they're good quality and will probably hold up well. That's the good news. The bad news is that they require assembly and there are no instructions. Not even a photo of the guards on the skates. After searching the manufacturer's website, I found instructions (still with no diagrams or photos) and learned that they have to be cut to size and screwed together. I bought three pairs of these guards (pink, clear and green). If there were illustrated instructions, I would have given 5 stars."
2,Not what I expected,These guards were not as I expected and were too hard to put together. They also did not fit the skates properly.
3,It Does The Job,"I am an avid Ipod freak. I needed the tunes in the car. Here's what I found out:It's great stationary, ie from a digital boom box. Forget trying to tune it in on a rotary fm tuner.In the car, especially on the highway, the signal goes in and out when in between trees and large boulders. It gets hissy. But that may just be because of radio towers.The battery life sucks really bad. I can probably take it on 2 1/2 days of work. Maximum battery life with good batteries is 3-4 days.Get this fm transmitter if you don't live near radio towers.Very good for stationary use through digital stereos (taking to work in a kitchen).My recommendation is skip this, and get the car charger/fm transmitter. Or else you'll be recycling batteries by the bucket every month."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! JUNK!!!,"Worst waste of money! I bought this for my 5-yr-old. The graphics and sound are terrible. It was dropped once on carpet and froze up completely, never to work again. No off switch. She could play the games but found it boring. My 3 1/2 yr-old son hated it too. I feel like I was ripped off completely."
4,"Worked Well, But Expensive","I ordered two of these and they worked fine for my purposes. I was using them to convert inserts on my mixing board into aux sends and didn't have an issue with either of them. 15 bucks a piece is a little steep considering you can get the same functionality by just plugging in a regular TS cable halfway, but nevertheless, they did the job they're supposed to do."
1,Unsatisfied customer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After purchising this item I installed it on my DW718 Type 1 saw, only to find that I could not adjust it. The adjustment screws move the lazer beam, but not enough to get the lazer beam to the cut line............."
2,Didn't fit!!!,"After I installed it I pulled the saw down and the Laser housing was rubbing against the plastic guard (Brand new, never used DW-716 and brand new laser). I called Dewalt and they told me to bring it in to a service center. Instead, I added spacers (washers) under the guard screws and now the laser clears during use.As far as Amazon, the order was filled and shipped quickly........as usual.P.S. - I was going to buy the light attachment but......"
5,Read the instructions. Take your time.,"It's my opinion that this should ship with the Dewalt miter saws. Having to buy this seperately is ridiculous.As far as the laser itself. It is very tedious and frustrating to set up. Do yourself a favor and plan on spending 30 mins to an hour setting it up. Once it is set up, though, it cut RIGHT where the laser indicated (I set it up to cut directly to the left of the blade).I think alot of people didn't take their time when setting up the laser. This thing is NOT plug-and-play by any means.If you buy this laser (which I would recommend you do), go here: [...] (or do a web search for ""dewalt laser 7187 tips"") and follow the laser set up tips. Basically you have to align and realign the laser in increments gradually getting the laser directly where you want it."
1,Not Accurate,"This product was a big dissapointment. The laser installed fairly easily after reading the instructions, but then was a pain to adjust. After I finally adjusted the laser I found that the line it projected was very thick and that is not adjustable. After a couple of cuts it was back out of alignment. This Item is just not up to par with the rest of the saw which I am very pleased with."
5,DEWALT DW7187 Adjustable Miter-Saw Laser System,"Great addition for the DW 718 Miter saw. The DW7187 Adjustable Miter Saw Laser System was designed for the professional miter saw user and will only fit the DeWalt DW715, DW716, DW717 & DW718 12-inch Miter Saws.This addition will save you time when making precise cuts."
2,"Good for 2x4 construction, but little else.","If you plan to use this in rough-in contruction or deck building and like to work fast, it might work well for you. Otherwise, skip it, especially at sixty plus dollars."
5,"Fast, accurate and easy to install!","I bought this laser set for my 12"" DeWalt mitre saw to speed up my time cutting trim. It has been the best thing since sliced bread!All I can say is buy it, use it and enjoy it!"
3,Construction grade,"I bought my DeWalt for a room addition and this ""idiot proof"" alignment laser for the saw. I found it very useful for ""2x4 construction"" accuracy. You are not going to get 1/64 inch accuracy out of this, but for a quick alignment and cut. Oddly, it works best for accuracy in moderate to strong light. Not enough and the glare will all but blind you. It is a pricy, but reasonalbly accurate tool. It is really a pain to adjust, I agree."
3,"cute toy, very loud.","This toy is cute but very loud. My daughter enjoys it when she plays with it, but it isn't a very played with game compared to the other games she has. I keep it up high on a shelf and very rarely does she ask to play with it. My daughter is 2 and a half."
2,Great for starters,"If you want to know more about the powers within and you've never explored this part of yourself before, then this just might be the book for you. If however, you've delved into this area before, you'll find it wishy washy and wished that the author would just get to the point! With that in mind, I found it rather boring. I'm not one for books that tell me all about the authors life stories and I certainly didn't learn anything new. Definitely a book for people who are looking for a starting point in this subject."
3,We have the power!,"This book was very difficult to absorb. I absolutely agree with all the reviews you MUST have an open mine. We all have the power to connect with the spirits that have left us and to what level I think is up to us. Very positive energy allows us the power to make our own lives spiritual, peaceful and believable. All and all I did enjoy reading this book it is a book that you must read a couple times to truly absorb the insight intended."
2,Thorn Birds is not like the book.....,"it pretty much follows the book faithfully in circumstances but not much in character. Ralph, in the series, is long suffering but in the book he came across as smarmier. And instead of Justine being distant and flippant, she acted more like a spoiled brat. The heart of the book didn't really translate with the mini-series. Ick!"
3,"A melodramatic yet guilty pleasure, I love The Thorn Birds..","but, as they say, the book was much better. Richard Chamberlain and Rachel Ward did a fine job as the leads. (I despised Chamberlain's Father Ralph just as much in the movie as in the book and Ward's Meggie impressed me far more towards the end of the movie as in the novel).All the other characters were played well by the actors except for Justine's character. In the book, Justine was a strong, self-willed, determind young woman struggling with knowing she wasn't as treasured as her brother Dane. However, in the miniseries, she came across more as a cynical, whining brat.On the whole, because I've read the book so many times, I watch the movie every once in a while as a guilty pleasure. But I'll always go back to the book to get the whole story that somehow the movie seems to miss.By the way, Meggie's maiden name is not Carson, it is Cleary. Mary Carson was her aunt, Paddy's sister, not her grandmother."
5,BUY THIS and you will NOT be disappointed.,"The length of this miniseries, although may serve as a deterent for some people in buying it, is actually KEY to making this love story one of the best, if not THE best, of all time. If it was condensed into two hours, it certainly would not be as intense and believable. This series is worth every minute of it-- every second of it. SUPERB! This movie's true sincerity and passion makes it one of my all-time favourite love stories. The chemistry between Ralph and Meggie is so realistic and believable. Trust me, if you are one for an excellent love story which will make you believe in love again, then BUY this film. I just hope that it becomes available on DVD soon!! My tape is starting to wear out! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Love This Movie,I remember with this movie was on television as a mini series. It was unbelievable. Each night that you thought the movie had reached the climax something else happened to blow you out of the water! The actors were great also.
1,He's a welfarest,I whole heartily believe the only good thing Singer has done for animals is come up with the word Speciesism and define it. Other than that he is a Welfarest and I completely disagree with his approach to animal liberation.I think if many of you who are considering reading this book you will have better spent your time gaining a clearer understanding of Animal Welfarism VS Animal Rights/ abolitionism. Look up Gary Francione and Bob/ Jenna Torres stance on this debate first before purchasing this book.
5,Pixared again!,"This is a brilliant collection and a must have for any Disney/Pixar fan. It is too expensive for how short it is but if you can find it on sale somewhere, snatch it up and get ready for some wholesome family entertainment. I can't wait for a third installment into this wonderful growing collection."
3,Wasn't as good as the first Pixar Short Films,"I was truly disappointed with this DVD, yet my husband enjoyed it. I felt the first was the best by far."
3,good movie,it's entertainingi will suggest this to my other relativesit's good for my daughter basic in her study as an animator
4,Murder She Wrote,"As usual, Jessica's values are refreshing. It is nice to have to use your mind to solve the mystery as does Jessica. It is refreshing to concentrate on the clues instead of blood, guts and sex.Cabot Cove is such a refreshing place to escape and yet it is refreshing to find yourself among celebrity friends of hers and see what other places she visits. Family is important to her even though she never had children. Her relationship with Seth is so healthy. I can watch her for a while and the world seems in place before I return to reality in my occupation."
5,WONDERFUL!!!!!,I watch these so often! I am so thrilled to have them in my collection! These are such great Entertainment!
2,my least favorite LTJ cd,"This CD kinda disappointed me. The average rating before I rated it was 4.5 stars. I payed 18 dollars for this CD and would very likely sell it for 5. The best song on here is ""Scott Farcas Takes It On The Chin"", and that's not one of their best songs, this CD barely beats one star. Not as much ska as ""Losing Streak""."
5,LTJ,"My hubby loves LTJ and when it comes to his music about the only thing I listen to. I Think I Love You, was one of the first song that he played for me, then the CD broke. So how perfect is it to buy for our anniversary. And I do not agree with the below 3 rating, I'm not a huge punk, ska, grunge fan but I am a LTJ fan and I enjoy the garage band sound of this CD, brings me back to my teens when I was dating my hubby 10 yrs ago!"
5,I love it...,"I'm starting to think I'm going to have to get a subscription to MoJo -- it's getting harder and harder to find here in Canada. This is one of the most progressive magazines around. It is a well written, hard hitting magazine that covers politics from a progressive viewpoint. I like having access to something that contradicts the pro-business/capitalism point of view that dominates in the North American media. The quality of the writing and the photography is high, and the articles are timely and topical enough that they can lead to great conversations with guests. If you're all at open to reading a socialist/left wing viewpoint on national and international issues, this magazine is one you'll want to read."
2,pseudoscience,I am interested in a REAL magazine of progressive politics and environmental conservation. Most of this is poorly researched invective.
2,Maybe worth a shot.,"Me: Independent. I like varying points of views, but the agenda of this magazine is too relentlessly leftward. The writing is well done, and it does act to balance the similar excessiveness of the far right. In that regard, Mother Jones can be thought of as a useful tool if your trying to find the truth between the two extremes.My other magazine subscriptions: The Economist (5 stars), The Smithsonian (5 stars), Popular Mechanics (2 stars)"
3,OK Christmas Songs,"There are a few Christmas Classics by some singers that you can't go without during the season. However, after awhile they all start to blend together because everywhere you go the same songs are playing over and over. The radio stations not only do this with Christmas music but with all music to the point of frustration. Anyway, not a bad Christmas collection. Remember Christ is the Reason for the Season!"
4,It's really not so bad,"I don't usually write reviews, but I feel compelled to answer some of the unduly harsh criticism of this CD. No, it doesn't stack up to ""24 Hours A Day"" or ""Brooklyn Side"" -- few records do -- but it's a delightful little disc with several memorable songs that's far better than what most bands put out. It's apparent that Brian and the boys really put their hearts into it and had some fun in the process. Even the obviously dated cuts sound appealing."
1,Songs of Sahm,"Absolute [junk]. The Bottle Rockets are one of my favorite bands, and I got the sinking feeling listening to this album that it's all over but the shouting. The lack of creativity and flatness of this CD is disappointing to say the least. I hope their next release is not anything close to this bad."
2,Total Let down,"I'd say this film is THE BIGGEST let down, next to Impact, in the Warren Miller film collection. Like the previous reviewer said, this film is extremely over-commercialized with all kinds of garbage, and there's a lot less skiing/boarding, and more movie-like attempted story telling. Stay far, far away from this film. It was a waste of money to go see, and definitely a waste of money to buy.On the upside, this year's film, Off The Grid, was very enjoyable. They must have finally got the hint to get rid of the ridiculous amount of commercialization, and go back to the roots of what made Warren Miller films so succesful. Look for that film to be released some time in January of 2007, and get that instead."
2,Where's Warren??,"Warren Miller is involved with this movie in name only. His catch phrases ""if you don't do it this year..."" were dubbed in from earlier movies. I could live with the departure of Warren (he's in his 80s after all), but the movies are also over-commercialized -- hitting too many mountains and helicopter trips, and too many product placements. There's very little of the spirit left that makes Warren's millers so wonderful. Buy an old one and skip this garbage."
2,Not the Same Good Old Warren Miller Movie,"Boring. It's transparent that the few lines actually spoken by Warren Miller are clips inserted from other projects. The new narration is not engaging or very humorous or even very interesting. Without Miller's quips and keen sense of humor and vision, I'm afraid that merely putting his name on the movie and including recycled Miller lines is not going to keep a lot of Miller fans interested for long. My husband and I didn't even finish watching it before nodding off to sleep."
1,mostly boring except for two excellent segments,"1. part about kids skiing in Aspen, they are really good.2. The world's luckiest right turn..avoiding an avalanche taking an entire hillside down, skiier turned right, not clear if skiier saw it or heard it and turned but what is silly is that narrator has no follow-up or insight to offer on these interesting little bits.Too much talk by folks who just ski ... it is'nt like they are interesting to hear beyond the usual. Some of the conversations are not too bad, but they just get repetitive"
5,Fun strategic card game.,This game is very similar to cut-throat pitch with a few extra strategic aspects. My family and I have hours of fun playing this game. All ages can play Rook and it can become quite addicting. This game is easy to learn yet takes many games to develop your own strategy. Very fun.
5,Good news from the States,"Frankly, I'd rather wouldn't expect a perfect progressive DJ mix from an American DJ (except maybe D:FUSE). But Christopher Lawrence keeps on amazing me - this is his best DJ set ever - deeper, serious, energizing!!! I would desribe this more like progressive house, rather than trance - but call it whatever you like - this release is simply amazing!"
3,Guinea pig harness,Nice product - could have given more accurate size guide - seems to run on the small side. Nice idea though - thanks!!
1,Extremely Dangerous for Piggies,"Since my guinea pig loves to run, I thought this would be perfect; but it's far from it! I tried both the medium and larger sizes, and both were too small. Even the largest size was too small around the neck for him. It fits around the middle, but not around the neck. I reccomend NOT using this product at all! It is dangerous to the guinea pigs as it may choke them."
4,Another low budget Christmas CD,"This is a low-budget Christmas compilation. It is not bad, but there are better ones available. The first 5 songs are from his classic 1957 Christmas album and the last 4 songs are from his 1971 ""The Wonderful World of Christmas"". This CD has some really good songs on it, but it only has 9 songs. I would recommend that you spend a few extra bucks and buy the outstanding ""If Everyday Was Like Christmas"" CD which contains every Christmas song that Elvis recorded!"
4,Map o' Fun,"I was looking for a puzzle that would have cut outs of the states, for my child to learn the states shapes. This is a pretty good deal, although some of the smaller upper north east states are merged together. It's easy to put together, except for the lower and side ocean blue areas of Hawaii and Alaska, a child younger than 7 may need help."
4,Excellent book!!!,"Strike first, strike fast, strike hard! Good advice for almost any situation. This book has an incredable amount of information on pre-fight posturing. His ""de-escalation/first strike stance"" is something that should be incorperated into every practical personal defense program, from police/security to the average Joe. The drills in this are golden. Much of the training involves proper mental attitude, which is essential when in a high-stress situation. My only real complaints are that there are too many techniques (doesn't look like he follows the KISS principle) and that Mr. Franco's ""reference material"" is pretty much just his other books. Also, I think some of his principals are better suited for advanced students, even though the book is supposed to be for begginers. Those who are familiar with JKD may find a lot of similarities in this book. Overall, a great book, especially for self-defense instructors, but sometimes just has too much information."
5,Great baseball parody makes this all worth while,"The 15- to 20-minute baseball game sequence in ""The Naked Gun"" is - in my opinion - the funniest stretch of cinema in American film history. From Leslie Nielsen's rendition of the National Anthem under the guise of opera singer Enrico Pallazzo (shades of Carl Lewis' infamous attempt at 'singing') to his classic balls and strikes calls to the Queen doing The Wave and passing hot dogs, the Zuckers just absolutely nailed and perfectly zinged everything there is to zing about baseball. You can watch it a dozen times and discover something new every time.Also, every fan of this movie probably thought of Frank Drebin recently when a CNN reporter left her mike on the restroom. That's right out of The Naked Gun."
5,Just as good as Airplane! if not better,"This film hits all the right buttons! Hillarious word-play, visual puns, and deadpan delivery from Neilson make this one of my all-time favorite comedies. Throw in Priscilla Presley as the sultry love interest, Ricardo Montalban as the villian and you've got comedy gold. And despite his trouble in court, I've always loved O.J. Simpson in the Naked Gun trilogy. If you've been living under a rock for the past decade, run out and SEE THIS FILM!"
4,All you can do is laugh,"If you liked Airplane (and who didn't) then you'll love the story of Frank Drebin, the completely incompetant police detective. Leslie Nielsen takes centre stage is this hilarious comedy that's guaranteed to make you laugh. Sure it wont blow your mind, but the sight gags and one-liners are priceless"
4,Great bottles,"These bottles are awesome for storing fresh expressed (and frozen) breast milk.They fit perfectly with my Medela Pump-in-Style pump parts.They travel very well (no leaking for me in two-plus months of use) and warm nicely.The ones I received had labels, white lids (a couple extra) and were packaged loose.If you run out of labels, use a bit of masking tape.When freezing the bottles note they definitely expand, even with 1oz of room at the top and will crack/break if they fall on the floor.Overall, I would recommend this product."
3,No labels,"The bottles themselves are nice and handy. My problem was the packaging. No labels, just a plain white box. You will not be able to identify if you dont open the box. no indication what's inside. The bottles also looked they wete just thrown into the box. No plastic wraps to indicate they really are brand new. Very disappointing presentation."
5,Timeless and fun,"I decided to review this book upon noticing the ratty condition of my copy as compared to the rest of my instructional library. It has value for all levels and so it's something I love returning to as I gain experience. There is nothing like a good intro or ending. They are classified by style which makes them especially valuable. Take example the old classic western ""El Paso"". By applying Turners intro's and endings in D you can have your very own, personalized styling that will sound unique and appropriate to lovers of the song.My favorites however are the turnarounds. Most of us are introduced to guitar with individual chords, then progressions. Toss in a Turner turnaround and you have 80% of a song. Add and intro and ending and you've written a whole new one!"
1,Smelly,These pills nearly made my stomach hurt when I opened them because they smelled so bad. I didn't take a single pill from this bottle because of the smell. I don't know if they actually work or not..I threw them in the garbage.
4,Perfect picture and sound!,"Elton is a legend with lots of hit singles. This Blu-ray edition has excellent picture quality and sound in the top level.Unfortunately, the show is a bit static. Elton is an amazing singer with a good voice but a bit boring to see on stage. Some lifting will be here and there with personal drive and a great backing band. Congratulations on your 60 years since Elton.You were the best in the 70s.Greetings from SwedenGunnar"
4,a good concert and long,This is a good birthday bash for Elton and a great concert is over 3 hours and no I'm not that type.After all those years is is still a great performer .
2,Very disappointing!!,"BU with 1080i, these days? OK, image is very good, but 1080p should be mandatory! No Dolby Digital 51. nor DTS 5.1, even if the new HD formats would be available? OK, but PCM only sucks!Honestly, I hope the producers issue a new version, which will need two discs of course, with the missing above.More expensive? Sure, but not frustrating!!! If concerned about cost the consumer can buy the SD version, which includes DD and DTS, as well as many extras...Bad, bad job!"
4,ELTON 60 - Live At Madison Square Garden,"Excepcional Show, no inicio no impressiona, porem vai ganhando valor a cada musica. Extrema emoo a partir do 2/4. Em Blu-ray, a qualidade dos detalhes e som impressionam ainda mais, é como estivesse ao VIVO.Elton 60: Live at Madison Square Garden"
4,Good show,Excellent image and sound. The songs could be better as Elton John has enough good music that was not played at this show. The rest is okay.
4,Never go wrong with Dickens,"Charles Dickens was almost always ""on the money"" for me, in his writings, and this is no exception. A glimpse into the lifestyles, trials and tribulations, of his times. I felt this was more than adequate in terms of acting and costumes. I would say that sets at times left something to be desired, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. If you like other Dickens period pieces, you will most likely like this as well."
5,Game of Life,"I think this game is reasonably good because it shows people what happens in adult life. I rated this toy's educational value 4 stars because adult life does not have much to do with luck, which is shown in the game because a roll of dice is pure luck and life always have actions leading to consequences. This toy is not extremely durable because some pieces are quite small and could get lost easily, the paper money is very thin and could get torn. Overall, I think this game is 5 stars because it is very fun to play and that is the most important thing."
2,Not your father's game of life!,"I played this game countless times as a teenager in the 70's. My two sons (8 & 5) wanted it and I thought it would be a blast from the past. While some of the changes in the game play itself are fine, I couldn't get over the poor quality of the game board itself. The spinner I grew up with was so durable. The new one sucks. It's virtually impossible to spin it without the whole wheel falling off. That in itself was very disappointing - and really caused a lot of frustration! Why cut cornes? Especially when many of the people buying this game, probably played it as a kid!?"
1,Lots of holes in the rules!,"Has anyone figured out . . .1 - What if you run out of Bank Loan chits?2 - What are those little arrows on some of the spaces for?3 - The rules say that in some cases you can get a double salary -- but they don't say which cases.Monopoly, by contrast, has these questions all sewed up, not a hole or a situation they haven't thought of."
5,always and awesome game,This game is very fun and orginal. this is a really fun game and i love playing it with friends and family. i got to know my friend way better than i did before. my sister and i had a long talk and we had a good time! i love this game. i would recomend this game to anyone!!!!! :)
1,"Worst product change since ""New Coke""!","I played this game with my sisters when I was little and loved it. I bought it recently for my children and cannot express how disappointed I am. All the changes are for the worse! The game is now loaded with extra steps that slow the pace down to a crawl. It was far too complicated for one parent to assist three children and still have a good time. Needless to say, I don't recommend this game."
1,Newer isn't always better,"If you have ever played the earlier version of life please do yourself a favor and avoid this ""new"" version like the blak plague. My friends and I used to play the old version every single day up to late hours. Once we learned the new version was out we ran and bought it. WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT!!!! Compared to the old version this one is HORRIBLE. It isn't fun. The new rules [are not good]. You can not bet anymore. Money isn't the way it used to be (what's with the litte pieces of carton?) Maybe if someone at MB reads this they will go back to the basics and bring back what was once a great and fun family game to play. Lucky for us we still have, and play with, our old and much better version of Life."
5,Going through LIFE,"The Game of LIFE is a very fun game, though it takes quite a while to set up the board. At the beginning, you get to choose whether to start in college or jump right into a career. If you get the police career card, you get $5,000 from anyone who speeds (spins ten). As you go through the gameboard, you get married, buy a house, have babies, and (ready for the most exciting part?) earn salaries! You also earn LIFE cards, which earn you big bucks, but you cannot look at them until the end of the game. You can even buy stocks and insurance!If you choose to jump right into your career, you choose a salary card which can range from $20,000 to $100,000. You also chose a career, anything from artist to computer consultant.The bad thing about this game is that the ""people pegs"" you get when you are married or have babies, always fall out of their cars.I would recommend this game for ages 6 and up."
3,In the end of the game you're exausted.,When you play this game for the first time it's great. I've had this game for a month now and I still don't know all the rules. This game takes to long and it's impossible to know all the rules. if you like math and money games then buy this.
4,PastorJ,I got this game for use with my youth ministry at a weekend retreat. It helped me teach my point for the weekend and the kids seemed to enjoy playing it.
5,Very fun game,"I love this game. I got it last year for X-mas- I couldn't wait to open it! My brother and i played it for hours until Christmas dinner, and then, after dinner, we played it til' 1:00 am!! It is a very entertaining game, and you can learn many things as you go through life (Beware! May not be for younger kids!) I am satasfied with the quality of the board and that and recomend it to anyone who loves bordgames!"
3,what game!,"When I was getting ready to type my review on this site, I noticed the older people said that they liked the older version. I began to agree, too, even though I don't have the older version. It's still a fun game. The things I don't like there is, I always land on paying spots, the wheel sometimes doesn't work well, and one of the people pegs in my car usually fall down. This is the first Life board game I've ever purchased before. But I considered it nice since I bought the Playsation version. I thought I'll type a sooo nice thing about Life in here until I saw the grown-up's complaint's. I now wondered what does the older version looked like. What if Mr. Bradley put the old game on the market? That would be nice!"
2,Do you really want to teach your children to sue people???,"I was just now setting up this stupid game I got for my 9-yr-old son who asked for it. There are at LEAST 9 spots to land where you're supposed to sue your neighbor and get 100,000. I have a real problem with that. Another is where you get cosmetic surgery...what? I came online to see what alternatives I could come up with and make my own stickers to put over top of the extra bad spots. Definately should have read the reviews. I didn't have this one as a kid, but I can't immagine it being like this."
3,"Random, Involved, and Unassembled","This is a fairly fun game, but has several drawbacks. The goal is to get the most money. Money can be obtained by landing on certain spaces, stock, salary (which is random and from $20,000 to $100,000), and your job (which is also random). The game is almost entirerly luck. The only major descisions are purchasing stock, chosing a path, and choosing a job (if you go to college). The game is practically always determined by the highest salary, unless someone happens to land on a trade salary cards space. It does incorporate lots of things from real life, and is educational in that respect. The various pieces are time-consuming to set up and the spinner doesn't spin well. This game is best as a family / party game, but isn't usually worth playing."
1,"If I could have given it ZERO stars, I would have...","I hate the writing style, but that's just personal preference. She keeps injecting these thoughts throughout that are supposed to give you a feeling of suspense but it just got annoying. She kept saying the same exact phrases over and over to the point where I just wanted to tear the book apart. I know a lot of the stuff that annoyed me was mainly to show us what the main character was like, how she was raised, and the horrible things that she had to deal with...but I just wanted her to SHUT UP. I skipped over several paragraphs because I was sick of reading the same thing so much, and I wanted this book to be over as quickly as possible.Absolutely the worst book I have ever read. HATED IT. I saw that it is selling for 18 cents on amazon...don't waste your money. No wonder this book was in the bargain bin at my local bookstore..."
5,An excellent study,"This book takes one of the most controversial actions in the greatest campaign of the Civil War and re-examines the original documents related to the controversy, at least insofar as they can be found. The thoughtful, reasoned analysis of Stuart's actions, his basis for them, and their ultimate effects on the outcome of the campaign, combine to produce a fresh book on the Gettysburg campaign.Certainly it will not settle the controversy fully, but it is a welcome addition to the canon of literature on Gettysburg."
5,One of the better books in the genre.,"""In the Hand of the Goddess"" is the stunning sequel to ""Alanna: The First Adventure"". This book was so incredibly breath-taking, I found myself gasping at every turn. The characterisations are superb, embedded in a well-developed plot set in a believable world.Alanna is the young, secretly female squire of the heir to the Tortallen throne. She struggles with her identity, visitations from divinities and the love of her best friends and gradually discovers herself. She faces her nemisis in the oily Duke Roger, and.....The characters in this book bear notice because they cannot be neatly classified, as the one-dimensional characters in so many modern books so neatly show us. The world is completely believable, from the gods and goddesses to the common people. Tamara Pierce ought to be commended for her excellent work in this genre, allowing it to become something more than shallow entertainment. This book is a gem; do yourself a favour and get it today!!"
3,For young people,These are well-written lovely books for young folks - especially girls aged 9-16 or so. A bit too boring and simplistic for adults. Tamora Pierce has done a great service for young people and I highly recommend them for anyone 16 or younger.
4,In the Hands of the Goddess,"Tamora Pierce is an excellent writer. She pulls in the desire of young Alanna, who wants to become the first lady knight in a century. It's easy to relate to the story to your own life. It teachs that if you want to become strong or good at something, you need to practice, practice, practice and that's what Alanna did. Alanna fight with her love of adventuring, and the love of three men, the Shang Warrior, The King, and the King of Thieves."
5,My favorite book Of All Time,"In this book, the author, Tamora Pierce, creates an intriguing plot, that grabs your attention and doesn't let go. The main character is quirky, and independent; yet is also perfectly believable and easy to relate to as she is often as confused and emotionally unstable as, well, everybody human. This book is not all action either, it has it's share of romance as well.The end will leave you hoping for a third book, which there is, although not half as satisfying as the 2nd. But don't let that slow you down, for upon finishing the 3rd, there is a 4th!!! Which, to my opinion is nearly as great as the 2nd. After that there is another series (The Immortals), in which Alanna appears occasionally. And then the latest series (Protector of the Small), which also takes place in Tortall, and includes little snippets of Alanna. Oh, and make sure to read all of the books in the correct order for optimum satisfaction!"
2,Not So Great,"Tamora Pierce lays down the story of Alanna, disguised as a boy, a squire training to be a knight in the mythical kingdom of Tortall. I found the plot appealing but cliched (Alanna has an affair with her master), and I thought that the main charcter was too powerful-- her only weakness was the fact that's she's a girl in a man's world. She was the only one with the clarity to recognize the plot of the villain, and she defeats him easily. Tamora's writing style isn't very gripping; the fight scenes weren't exciting, and the suspense was dull. The writing style was simplistic. I read this book before I read the rest of the series and hated it. After I read the series in order, however, it's much more endearing, though still nothing I'd read twice.I think Tamora has the ability to write well, but this book isn't well executed."
4,Tamora Pierce Review,"The Song of the Lioness Quartet is a rather interesting story. In the Hand of the Goddess is the book in the series with the most interesting plot, except for the Tusaine War which tends to get a bit tiring. Although the storyline is interesting in this series, the writing isn't very interesting. The only thing that keeps you reading is the story line and not the good writing. I would recommend the Circle of Magic Series by Tamora Pierce more because of its better writing, and the more complex storyline."
4,"Excellent story, but not for indicated age group","Tamora Pierce weaves an engaging and exciting story, with all the elements necessary for a good fantasy. Her heroine is fallable and human, yet honorable and admirable in many ways. The story moves along well - keeping the reader on the edge of her/his seat. My concern is that the book and reviews state it is geared for 5th through 8th graders, yet the heroine engages in sex outside of marriage in this and the subsequent books of the series. It is not appropriate or healthy to encourage this age group to think about sex or to give them a heroine who behaves immorally. This is really unfortunate, since Ms. Pierce is an excellent writer and the objectionable parts of the book don't really add anything to the story."
2,An interesting book of swordplay.,"This book can be noted for it's forwardness and calabar, it's well writen and very moving but has some parts inapropreit for children.. this book is about Alanna's last years at the palace and how she over comes her three fears, the Ordeal of Knighthood, her fear of love, and her fear of Duke Roger of Conte"
1,"Babble on, Buddy","Being a big ""Kids in the Hall"" fan, and having seen the five star rating, I really thought I'd get a big kick out of this. What a disappointment. The jokes are tired and flat and the situations all strain too hard to be absurd. I like Scott, he's my third favorite Kid, but somehow the ""Buddy"" character just needs his vocal delivery to work. There are some bits that should be funny (the zombie waiter, the foot pageant), but they collapse under the strain of being part of a longer narrative. Maybe if he'd read the book to me from a barstool..."
4,All Time Favourites by Fausto Papetti,"I heard this CD at a friend's home and it was wonderful. It's all music - for lovers, for easy listening. I recommend this CD highly."
5,"Great book -- great advice, easy to read","This is a book based on solid research, from Harvard Medical School, written in a friendly style accessible to everyone."
2,Doesn't work as I expected,"I bought the unit figuring that I would attach my 20 pound propane tank to the 1 pound canister and open the valve and that the pressure differential between the two would result in the one pound canister filling up to one pound, but after a few seconds of gas moving from one to the other it stops and only about .25 pounds of propane moves into the smaller container. I'd say it's not worth the money or time and I'll just buy new one pounders when I need them."
4,1 lb propane tank refill adapter,Works okay. Allows you to refill and reuse 1 lb propane tanks. As mentioned in other reviews the best method is to have the source tank warm and the 1lb tank chilled.
5,Free From Guilt...,"Now I don't have to feel guilty--I previously tossed the empties in the trash.I just refilled my first 1# cylinder--worked great. As mentioned by others, the empty was placed in the freezer for about 2 hours. The 20# source tank was then placed in the sun, inverted and the adapter attached. The empty was ice cold at start of fill but was warm at completion--took only 1 minute.Data: Empty tank weighed 14oz. After the one minute fill it weighed 30oz. New (full) bottle from store also weighed 30oz."
2,too fast for beginners,"I read all the great reviews in Amazon and ordered this DVD.I did not like it that much, she goes too fast teaching the samba basic step and the other steps too. I am a beginner and this is my first DVD; I expected to learn from this DVD and not the previous one. She repeats the steps only twice and expects me to do it perfectly, it's not happening.She should take her time and break the steps one by one and little by little but no, she runs in this DVD.This is the only DVD of hers that I have and I would not order another one."
2,I dont know,"As much as i like samba, i found this way to intense for me, i have her second DVD and its awesome, but this one is another story, maybe once i get rid of a good amount of weight i can be able to move like these ladies, dont get this if you are just starting to learn samba......"
4,Microwoft Word Pretty Good,"Found this book to be helpful although, at times, it forgets to include a key step. I use in conjunction with the online help of the software. I am working on software manuals that are 200+ pages and I could not be handling without the extra information provided in the book."
4,Cryoderm Roll on,It does distract me from my aches and pains......but it makes me cough to breathe in that menthol smell.
2,"its OK, there rae better one","I think this is OK, like Biofreeze and all other product. I think its way too expensive tho I will just do ice therapy, its free, natural and works as good. If you want to spend money, by tauma oil instead. Its cheaper and less chemical means healthier for your body, for your furniture, for your cats. I use it all the time putting it everywhere, and my house feels so soothing."
4,numbing aches & pains,"Have use this product for a few years, being a chronic migraine sufferer, I roll it on my forehead, neck and side of head, the numbing gives me 20 to 30 minutes of relief."
3,Wife needs back relief .,"Seems to help a bit, but not the cure... they should make one with an adjustable air bladder inside: a Sleep Number Roll? Hmmmm...."
4,So far so good,I've been using for 2 weeks seems to work great for me. You can't beat this price for this item.
3,This is not a toy,Great for back support! Very durable and comfortable. Outside cover removes for easy cleaning and inside is wrapped in plastic to keep from getting wet or bugs.
2,Large D-roll would be better,"I bought this for driving. It's not thick enough for me, and the shape tends to concentrate the pressure in a narrow area. They should make a 6"" (minimum) D-shaped roll. I'll have to go back to a thick rolled-up towel."
4,Excellent Lumbar Roll,"Been using Lumbar rolls for past few years to ""stuff"" my disk back into place. I travel alot and it is a must on airplanes. So I keep it strapped on through the entire trip. My son calls it my Dweeb Roll. Although some have thought it was too firm, this turned out to be better than the other ones that I have used. Only negative as others have mentioned is the belt. The only easy way to get it on and off is to step in and out. Wish they would add a quick disconnect."
2,Not that impressed,The lumbar roll doesn't form to my back like I had hoped for and it is very uncomfortable. I purchased on the great reviews it got but have been disappointed using it in the chair or car.
2,Use a towel,The roll quickly flattened out to be thinner that the rolled up towel it replaced. Should have stayed with the towel
4,very firm,"The reviews for the regular version mentioned it was a bit too soft, so I ordered the firm version. It is exactly as described, FIRM. I wish now I had ordered the regular version for my office chair. Product is as described."
5,This says it all:,"Justin Stokes would never forget the summer she turned fourteen, nor the woman who transformed her bleak adolescent life into a wondrous place of brilliant color. In the little pond side hut also known as the ""finishing school,"" eccentric, free-spirited Ursula DeVane opened up a world full of magical possibilities for Justin, teaching her valuable lessons of love and loyalty, and encouraging her to change, to learn, to grow. But the lessons of the finishing school have their dark side as well, as Justin learns how deep friendship can be shattered by shocking, unforgivable betrayal."
1,"Great movie, horrible DVD","The print quality is awful, like they took a worn tape and dubbed it, speckles all over the place. And sound is out of synch by nearly a half second!! Didn't anyone watch this before they shoved it out on the market? Shameful. A total burn job."
4,One of Eastwood's Best!,"Drama, action and suspense are all rolled into this classic Western. Although this movie isn't academy award material, it's certainly far better than the shallow, over-hyped ""Unforgiven.""Both Eastwood and Van Cleef deliver solid performances in this film as does Volonte in the role of El Indio. Yet for all its strengths, the film does have a few weaknesses. Namely, it tends to drag at times and there are a few noticable miscues.Aside from these minor flaws, this is a really enjoyable movie that's definitely worth watching time and time again."
4,This better be fixed,"I'm buying this thing just to have it, even though I'm pretty sure I can do all the lines by heart, but they better have fixed the audio track, in the last DVD it was off a good half second. Of the three I prefer this one, the story line is simple, the buddy theme with Lee Van Cleef is even better than GBU, and Indio is one of the best bad guys ever.Follow up: Well, it appears to me that the soundtrack has been fixed, and follows the film as close as you could expect, given how it was made (English voice overs of course). Great, so I have a solid copy of this. I've only seen it about 150 times already, and it's a staple on TV, but some things you need to have."
4,Best Western...,"If Clint Eastwood didn't win an Academy award for this movie, he should have. This is a story about three men. All of whom are very, very greedy. Each one of them possesses their own set of rules regarding getting the ""goods"". This is an older movie that was first released in the 1960s (I was just a mere kid then). I remember it fondly because of its unforgettable musical score. I have that tune on my cell phone now. I remember that either the score or that particular cut won an award the following year. Anyway, if you like westerns, you'll love this one."
2,Holy Jeez Mother Mary,"They don't come much worse than this one. A few interesting scenes but as usual with Leone this thing drags and drags. And his bad guys are so despicable and unclean they render themselves unwatchable. Do yourself a favor....Spoiler alert: and fast forward to the final scene, skip the rest of this turkey. Clint's cool as hell but even he can't carry this grunt-n-squintathon. Wasn't very popular in the 60's, and doesn't translate at all now."
2,not the best place to learn,"Tommy Hypno Chan is a good enough funk dancer. If you live in an area where there arent many choices for pop locking instruction, you might bennefit from taking classes from some one of Tommy's skill level.If you're buying a DVD, there are much better options.but really just search youtube. THere are tons of free clips of classic funk dancers, like poppin pete, poppin taco, and salah teaching classes."
3,Sizes misleading; nice construction,"I purchased two shirts and was initially impressed at the solid construction. The material looked and felt nice, comparable to more expensive brands. Unfortunately, I'll never be able to wear the shirts. I have always comfortably fit into XXL size shirts; however, these XXL shirts were easily an entire size smaller than that. My advice: order one size larger than you normally do, and if you are normally an XXL, don't order these at all. It was a waste of money for me."
3,A simple book,"As someone in my 30s looking for a career change, I read this book and a few others in the series to look for ideas on what to do. I found this book simplistic, and didn't really get much out of it except a listing of more books and web sites to look at. I think this book may be aimed more at high schoolers, not adults. If you're a teenager, then this book might be good for you to learn about careers at hospitals, nursing homes, and day care centers. But if you're an adult, maybe just check this one out of the library."
3,Probably the worst of Uematsu's Piano Soundtracks,"I liked this CD a lot; I really did. But after listening to a number of other albums by Uematsu, such as Final Fantasy 7's & 9's piano soundtracks, this album is like listening to a 6th grade piano recital. There are some good songs, played simply, and even effectively, but most of it is just amaturish.Tracks 1-4, 8&9, & 11 & 13 are all very nice songs to listen to, but if you really want to experience this music properly get Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon instead. Nearly every one of these songs is played on that album and done with much more professionalism and expertise than that of this album. Plus, Celtic music is just pretty in and of itself."
4,profundo,LA VOZ DE ATAHUALPA SE VA DIRECTO AL ALMA DE QUIEN LO ESCUCHA. SOBERVIA INTERPRETACIÓN EN SU INIGUALABLE ESTILO...
5,Incredible,"This CD reminds me a great deal of a Connie Francis cassette tape that I had that had just about every hit that she recorded. What's nice about this CD is that it has not only all of her well-known hits, but some songs that may not have done as well on the charts. I am looking forward to listening to this CD."
4,Fun & Moving Triple Treat!,"I found that all 3 movies were great - each in their own way. Out of the Woods - was a heartwarming & light-hearted tale about a son reconnecting with his father. Follow the River - a beautiful drama set in the pioneering days where a woman must use everything to protect her family & make her way home. Finally, The Long Way Home - a heartwarming tale of 2 opposite making their way cross country for 2 different reasons. All I would recommend.!"
4,Good family entertainment,Wonderful story lines without all the negativity found in many of today's films. Good for any age group.
4,Follow the River,I have been looking for this movie for a while and was pleasantly surprised to find it so easily and at a reasonable price. thx.
2,Geek Lit,"SPIN is the type of magazine that tries too hard to be hip -- which, of course, is the exact antithesis of hip. Because of this geeky obsession to remain on the ""cutting edge"" (the editors obviously have no clue that they're about as close to the ""edge"" as FAMILY CIRCLE), the magazine doesn't age well -- track down some back issues and try not to laugh. On the other hand, if you're one of those intellectually stunted individuals who think tribal tats and Staind is as good as it gets, by all means send in that subscription card and join the ranks of the Supercool...."
1,I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY COPIES YET ! SO IT'S HARD TO GIVE A REVIEW !,I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY COPIES YET ! SO IT'S HARD TO GIVE A REVIEW !
1,mainstream,"Spin will do anything to try and stay hip. I wanted to gag when i saw a picture of blink 182 in their ""tribute"" to kurt cobain mag. Im a huge nirvana fan and the only good thing about those articles were the pictures. they were poorly written and dull. they didnt even scrape the surface of kurt's music, and his impact on an entire generation. i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin..."
1,Terrible Magazine,"Should be called Hip Hop Spin, it is really dirty mouthed junk. Everything bad, they are for, like you really actually bought this for your kids?I have made the mistake of buying a subscription and can hardly wait for it to end. It is not for main stream, mostly hip hop rap crap. Unimaginative writings and drivel from what must be the literacy underground. If you add the web service (email) be forewarned you will be getting carpel tunnel hand pains from the delete button. I am sorry, I was hoping it would be meaningful and helpful, it isn't. It is rubbish, no wonder they ""give it away"". This magazine needs to mature rather than it's current manure. I am disgusted with it."
4,Great movie,"I had waited a long time to have this movie, along with ""For a Few dollars more"" and ""The good, the bad and the ugly"", and fortunately enough I had access to this version of it. Great DVD, I wasn't aware but the DVD includes a standard and a widescreen version, so you can watch it whatever way you like. The only things in this version that feel a bit cheap are the lack of an informative booklet, and some more bonus features, which in this DVD are limited to the theatrical trailer only. Maybe other versions have these two things, but I must recognize I went for the price of this DVD. Anyway, I wanted the movie more than any booklet, so I consider myself satisfied. But if you want a better array of contents, maybe do some research here at Amazon, and probably a ""fancier"" version will be found. Great movie, never gets old!"
3,fist full of dollars--,"a young clint eastwood in a young western that makes no sense!! I didn't like it! IT was extremely unbelievable, especially the one scene that a machine gun hidden in the back of a wagon has killed an entire calvary troop but only kills two horses. I just don't think this is one of his best movies"
3,Get the collector's edition -not this one-,"Spaghetti western with Clint Eastwood, by Sergio Leone. I didn't like it. But maybe it was the edition: poor dvd quality, voices were added and don't match well the characters... Really like a home recording; it spoils whatever good the movie was.The story is interesting, but it feels too theatrical and unreal, like a pose for a photographer. The soundtrack was nice. It should have been shorter. I don't think the collector's edition, no matter how clean it is, could make it to 4 stars."
1,This was the worst movie i have ever seen!,"A Fistful of Dollars was the worst movie i have ever seen. Not even a great actor like Clint Eastwood can make this movie good. The movie doesnt have any speed. When the first thing happens u is awake, but right after that u fall asleep and u never wake up again. What ever u do. Dont see this movie!!!!"
1,Bad production Run?,"I don't know what the hell is wrong with these discs, but I have bought 3 copies in a row, and all three freeze and lock up at chapter 17. I am extremely frustrated, because the commentary by Christopher frayling is extremely informative and entertaining, and I truly love this movie. If anyone else has had this problem, maybe make a comment and detail it for anyone else having these issues.I love this movie, but I am sick of buying copy after copy that doesn't work."
4,This is what a re-working should be,"Often times when I watch a film that has been ""reimagined"" from a previous one, I lose interest within the first few scenes. That was not the case with ""Fistful of Dollars"". Having ""Yojimbo"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" as two of my favorite films, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I was nicely rewarded with my expectations being met, as well as pleased by how FoD kept my interest throughout. The styling of Sergio Leone that I love so much was present throughout the film. The story from Akira Korusawa's film was changed in such a way that it both held my interest and I didn't feel put off or disjointed by the changes. There are far more in depth reviews available here, so I'll simply end by saying that if you like the Clint Westerns, I highly recommend this film. Also, of course, you MUST see ""Yojimbo""...preferably first."
3,Good for kids.,"Like all the Rescue Heroes stuff that I've seen, this one is good for the kids. Probably okay for ages 3+.(Kids might give it 4 stars, if they like firefighters, etc.)"
3,Comment on Iran: The Coming Crisis,"The book was interesting to some extent, but it did not hold my attention the way I hoped it would. After reading a little way into it, I skimmed through the rest of the book. Perhaps I was just being a little picky, though. Others may have a different opinion entirely."
2,Off base and lacking.,"It is obvious that North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan having the bomb is dangerous. I believe all strategists know that these unstable regimes might be tempted to blow the planet up if they are going down the drain. Hitchcock tries to bring Bible readings as a justification for showing the end of the world. I believe any philosophy colored by religious fundamentalism causes problems in the world. Hitchcock might have a PhD in religion, but I feel he does not understand the Mideast enough to write a valid, scholarly work that would make strategists understand the problem of nuclear weapons better. This is a book written stating the undesireability of Iran getting nuclear weapons with some scripture thrown in.This is not a well thought out book. There are better books out there to understand the crisis."
1,not a good company.,I disagree with the book because enterprise is not a good car rental company. They left a woman all alone stranded when their car didn't work and didn't care....horrible company. So while reading this book it seems like hypocrites and liars because the book is a joke.
2,Pass on this one,"This book has a very enticing cover, but lacks in originality on the inside. There is little, if anything, I will be able to use in this book. First of all, I have found that very little collaboration between teacher and librarian goes on at the elementary level. Teachers do not remain with the class during library time and help the librarian. It is their plan time. This book gives a librarian role and teacher role for each lesson. Research skills occur more at the middle and high school levels. Teachers usually bring the class during their regular class time so they remain with the students. That is when collaboration can occur.I also found the activities and worksheets to be boring and unimaginative. I pride myself on activities that excite my children and make them eager to come to the library. Even when I'm teaching information or research skills, I try to make it a game. This book offers nothing along those lines. I recommend you skip this book."
1,Mag that encourages promiscuity among teens,"I used to read seventeen as a teen and looking back on it and flipping through a recent issue, I realized that this magazine is crude and talks to teens about sex as if it it was Cosmo or Marie Claire.This is not to be used as a moral compass and I don't think it has anything worthwhile reading. you would have read the magazine and taken nothing positive away from it.It's horrible."
5,Gift for Granddaughter,This was a gift for my granddaughter. She asked for it again for Christmas this year. She looks forward to this every month. She loves it.
5,AUNTIE/L,"THIS IS A MAGAZINE THAT HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER - NOW MY ""GREATNIECES"" ARE ENJOYING IT. I RECOMMEND IT AND IT IS ALSO AGE APPROPRIATE."
5,Students love it,Ordered this for my junior high library. Girls love it and can't beat the price! The eagerly anitcipate the next issue's arrival!
1,Mixed Up,"I renewed my subscription and it was supposed to pick up after my last renewel expired in Jan 11, but I got another issue of the months magazine. So, obviously, my subscription is another new one and I will be getting two magazines every month and will get short changed on my last few months, I am not happy with this confusing system and don't suggest anyone doing renewels because you miss out on issues!"
3,So superficial...,"This magazine is great if you want some light reading about boys,makeup,boys,clothes,sex, or boys. If you want a magazine truly worth your while, try Ellegirl or Teenvogue. If you are a preteen of ages about 11-12, DO NOT subscribe! This magazine is, indeed, for people that are around Seventeen years old, and unless you want to know about a lot of stuff you won't need to know until your married, stay away. But it is better than YM. But still, if you are a preteen try J14 or M!!"
3,Not that great,This magazine changed over the years. It went from reat good stories and advice to just a bunch of gossip and nonsense.
5,Must have for any network engineer,"As a network engineer, there are certain things I need to get out of the network quickly, without buying loads of software packages. This book gives you all the tools necessary to create your own scripts for managing, gathering information from, and tweaking your network. I never let this book leave my side. Couple the scripts in this book with some PHP/Java/HTML knowledge and you can write your own internal tools (as I have) or add more functionality to open source tools that are out there (as I also have)."
2,"ADVERTISMENTS, with NO STORIES","i am half tempted to cancel this, and get my $7 back. what a horrible magazine. i kid you not when i say that out of 127 pages, 100 of them are advertisements, and the other 27 pages are ""articles"" but out of those 27 pages, 5 of them are really just advertisements written by the guys who make the magazine. 15 of those pages are articles that contain less then 50 words a page, and the last 5 are REAL articles that have some sort of story written on the page.times are hard, i understand, but i can not see buying this magazine again with that many advertisements. this magazine is going nowhere fast, do not expect it to be around much longer. i was looking for a real magazine, with around 50% or less advertisements and good stories."
4,Great mag...,"this is one of my favorite magazines. Occaisionally it comes off too high tech but for the most part it is down to earth, informative & I'm always excited to see what new items they will be informing us about."
3,Popular Mechanics,"I was going to renew he sub. for the mag. anyway. This was the best price in town.I only gave it a three (3) star, no fault to AMAZON, as I have been purchasing Popular Mechaniics for over Forty years and the three stars are for PM, as it is no where as great a mag. as it once was. Sorry PM, but the ""Egg Heads"" now control the topics and the people of my generation, the ones paying all the bills and taxes, have a hard time understanding a lot of what PM is talking about.Oh well, it's a young mans world, I guess."
3,Spanish version in better,"The topics of the magazine are great, but it has too much ads, which makes it hard to read. I'd rather the spanish version, it's easier to read. Besides, delivery takes too much."
1,bad delivery,"I made my subscription in january 23, and it said shipped february 2 2007 and Im still waiting for it! today is March 19 2007"
5,INFORMATIVE MAGAZINE,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND BUT I FIND MANY, IF NOT ALL THE ARTICLES TO MY LIKING AND INFORMATIVE ALSO.THE PRICE WAS UNBEATABLE TOO! CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS PURCHASE."
2,Shallow and boring,"90% of the articles are between stupid and boring (for example, all kind of truck related stuff). occasionally there is an interesting article about something that is useful or innovative."
2,Debunking Popular Mechanics,"After the conclusions they drew from the 9-11 destruction, how do you believe anything they write? Impossible to see their reasoning on that and to me, that draws suspicion about everything else they write. Just another part of mainstream media."
3,Popular Mecanics,Read it all in short time. Informative but limited number of subjects in this volume. Recommend it for light reading.
4,"Good storys, But more ads then i perfer","Its has alot of good articles and How-tos, which i have been able to take advantage of more times then i can count. The only Grip I have is that they have alot more ads then a couple of years ago which I don't really like."
2,Doesn't stay inflated,"I was all excited to get this cause I have been having pain in my back every morning from sleepingin the sag of my mattress. This product works when it stays blown up, but I am having toblow it up once a week. :("
5,Simple to use--exactly what I needed!,I was a little hesitant to order this product...thinking it would not perform as described. I am glad to report that I am very satisfied with the Mattress Remedy. It has had a very positive impact on my lower back problems.
4,Good Temporary Solution!,"This is a good temporary solution for sagging mattress problems until you can purchase a better mattress. It is easy to inflate and does not require very much air. The pump is a bit flimsy in that it comes apart at times but it can be put back together and easily held in place while using it. However, it is overpriced but there are not any alternatives that I know of, except, using the money to go ahead and purchase a better mattress which you will have to do eventually, anyway."
5,It does the trick,"I was a little leary about this product, until I read the reviews on it.This thing WORKS! I sleep great every night now! Highly recommended purchase!"
3,Mia Gracefull pump,"I purchased this shoe in red--it is very sexy and creates a nice line on the leg. Overall, I am happy with this purchase for the price, but I would not pay more than the lowest Amazon sale price. The shoe is not real patent leather and has some small defects in the patent material, which easily scratches and becomes indented and wrinkled if rubbed or bumped. Also, the red color is darker than I expected; it is more of a brick red than a fire-engine red. This shoe is more stable and easier to walk in than other, more expensive pumps I own at the same heel height, however. This is the type of shoe that one can't expect many miles out of, but great for following the trends inexpensively."
1,great if you like lyrics,"I got this because I am intrigued by Wally Ingram's work w/ David Lindley - he is an impressive percussionist. I guessing his involvement on this album is because he has a crush on Crabtree. When it comes to folk music (any music really), I rarely listen to the lyrics until after I am hooked by the music. Crabtree's tunes are topical and heartfelt, but the music is only fair. I will not be keeping this CD."
4,Very Good,I found it extremely useful and I strongly recommend it to Chemical Engg. Graduate students
4,"Helpful,intersting, a bit hipocritical to others.","I found the book to be very haelpful and interesting. It was quite descriptive, which was also good. However in other books I have read they have said the exact opposite to this one, so therefore I found it a bit hard to follow and absorb. I haven't finished it yet but already it has filled with great knowledge and appreciation of witchcraft."
1,Its all a lie!,"This book is all a lie! if they want you to hurt someone you have to grab a branch someone has never touched. hit a cover blessed by jesus. and ect. to kill people you have to get babies intestine and boil it, drink it, and circle the fire. its all a lie so dont bother with this book!"
1,at the end,"when this was 1st released on vhs back in the 90s i bought it then i bought it again but now its not what it used to be its so dated their is nothing much to it, they stand in the same place playing the same songs that they did on every dvd after this - when this came out it was something cool that they have made a live vhs cause all that were available just a song from london and that was live as well, but now its clearly a dvd to cash in cause they look tired in every other dvd"
2,More fashion and fluff than exercise stuff,"While I rarely subscribe to magazines, I was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so I signed up for a one year subscription to Shape. Before and during college I was a ballet dancer, but after entering the real, 9-5 working world half a year ago, exercise time became more difficult to find. Unfortunately, I found that Shape magazine was not really about exercise at all. It was about beauty products, fancy new-age spas and resorts, and trendy workout accessories. I was also shocked by the models on the magazine's covers and pages. Not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing. I finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through, lacy top on the front of it, visible nipples and all. Workout wear? I think not! Trust me, the woman belonged in a porn magazine, not my exercise magazine!"
3,"Rather ""superficial"" if you ask me!","""Shape"" is a magazine that I receive as a ""freebie"" because of membership in a periodical service. This is one that I forward to my sister and she doesn't even find it a compelling read.Sharing some of the same components as its ""brother"" magazine ""Men's Fitness,"" ""Shape"" is for the woman that desires to look like the waifs that adorn its monthly covers.The feature articles and regular departments are rather routine and the information contained within can easily be found on the Internet or the local gym, without having to subscribe to the magazine.When my sister finishes with the ones that she gets from me, she donates them to an area doctor's office.That's about all they're good for, she claims."
2,Where did it go?,I am a current Shape subscriber and have it on my Kindle Fire as well. Now the Shape app is gone from my Kindle and I can't find where to re-install it. Where the heck did it go? Has anyone else had this problem recently?
4,Good Sports & Good Fashion,"I'm a reader of fashion and sports magazines and I find shape one of the best buys on the market for women who love sports in style.Shape gives you easy to follow tips on your workout routines, plus the general advices on fashion and beauty produts you can find on most women's magazines.On the negative side, I think it could have more contents, more pages, less ads and easier recipes, but it's still a very good buy."
3,Shape...,This is an average magazine. It has the miracle weight loss stories and the celebrity how-tos. There are actually some really good tips for weight loss and keeping it off with exercise. Some of the exercise examples are easy but most need to done at a gym.
3,Good articles -- other content unnerving,"Although the articles within the magazine are great, the rest of it is full of paid advertisment for supplements, and ""plans"" that many fitness experts have already debunked as NOT helpful, and in some cases, harmful. I wouldn't recommend this to any beginner exercisers, who should be focusing on healthy eating and exercising rather than diet pills and ""cure-all"" methods."
1,Adulteration of a Classic,"No doubt about it, Wallace Wattles' work is mandatory for the ambitious fortune collector. Unfortunately, Dr. Powell's version makes utter hogwash of the classic. Her 'explanation' of Wattles' theory is more than useless and befuddles understanding rather than helping it.Instead of this blatant nonsense, do yourself a favor and get the unaltered original version by iceni books."
5,An Excellent Insightful Look,"I have listened to this CD over and over and there's nothing quite like it. Mr. Wattles gets to the point without any 'fluff' and since this was written almost 100 years ago, it's still very applicable today. I would recommend this to anyone who (1) doesn't have time to sit and read a book and (2) wants to get the absolute facts on getting rich and how it's possible if these instructions are followed."
5,Great!,Great! book. Its a must read for anyone who wants to better their ways of doing business. to be rich is to think a certain way.
5,A high-end paperback at a low-end price.,"This Penguin edition of the Science of Getting Rich also contains Wattles' five-chapter How to Get What You Want. If you're a bibliophile, you'll also appreciate this book's ecru stock, deckle (ragged) edge, and covers that open up to serve as bookmarks."
5,A basic primer for success,I love The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles because it is short. It is not extraneous like Dianetics. I think even the average reader could finish this book in four evenings. Some of the chapter titles are 6.How Riches come to you; 7.Is your gratitude showing?; 8.Thinking in the Certain Way. Keep reading this book everyday. You will get ideas to turn your life around.
1,"""If your day is a failure...then you are a failure.""","I am a huge Secret fan & good thing Byrne only took a few excerpts from this book/CD otherwise we would have people depressed convinced they are a failure. Not enlightening, not inspiring."
3,Nothing new under the Sun,This book is the prototype of just about every 'Law of Attraction' book written in the 98 years since it was first published.Because all the other books tend to contain much the same message you may find this book a little dated in terms of style but you will no doubt find that the content is still quite good if you like LOA books (which I don't).The first thing you need to do to start increasing your wealth though is not to spend money buying this book - it's in the public domain and is free from literally dozens of sites on the web.
4,The science of getting rich,"The book was very informative and straight to the point, it was a easy read. The author really knows what he's talking about. I would recommend this book to any one interested in getting rich. It gives the reader another way to look and understand situiations in life. Thankyou from James Beith"
5,Good information even a hundred years later,"You'll notice that Choleric types hate this resource because they only believe in what they can see right here, right now. However, if you are open to visualization and The Law of Attraction, you'll benefit from this resource.The only drawback for me was the monotone, non-personality narration. Oh my gosh, this guy is dull. Almost to the point of being comical. Nevertheless, if you stay focused on the meat of the message you'll get past it for the most part.I swear this guy sounds as though he's reading an owners manual for a Fax machine. Oddly enough, using earphones made it easier to focus on the content of the message versus using a player with external speakers.All joking aside, this resource is worth owning and sharing with others who are seeking to improve their ability to attract good into their life and those around them."
2,The Science of Getting Rich,"The original text was interesting and I was able to glean some good information. I was disappointed with the updated / edited selection of the text (The first part of the book). It was almost a duplicate of the original and any re-writes were difficult to follow, some sections needed to be re-read. Had I known, I would have purchased the original version by Wattles."
4,Organizer Helped Me to be Orgnanized,I really think this is a valuable tool to organize your contacts. I also use it to store my screen names and passwords to internet sites. I think the manual presents real problems. It is printed on one large folded sheet of paper which makes it difficult to use. I think that the manual could be improved to help with the learning curve on using the organizer.
1,I can't use it,When I got it a password was set. I don't know the password.I can't use it!!!Why would there be a password when it was advertised as'new'.What a waste of money!!!!
3,Electronic Roll off the dex!,"When I purchased this rolodex I was searching for something to transfer my username and password information to for safe keeping. However, I wish i had not bought this item. It's probably not that difficult to use, but its too time consuming to figure out how to use it. I won't return it because its not worth the trouble , only paid $20 for it. I would only reccommend this product to the tech geeks out there, and not the faint of mind."
4,The Organizer,I think it is so cool. I am a big fan of electronics. So I'd like to check this one out.
2,Written by a man telling women how to think to win,"It's a book written by a man telling women how to change their mindsets to become successful. Don't think that since it's written by 3 PhD's, there are lots of researches with statistics to back up the claims. Instead, those insights sound more like his believes (""their"" believes if you count the other two authors, his daughters) and anecdotal stories.The tone in this book sounds like a man lecturing women on how they should live their lives and how they had been doing it wrong. That's why I felt that it's more like a book by 1 author than by 3. I rarely hear women talking to other women that way."
3,Not a complete guide for pregnancy,"This was the first book I bought for my first pregnancy, and I was disappointed that it did not cover many details about pregnancy that a new mom wants to know about. Each trimester is just one short chapter. It seems to be more focussed on the family after the birth. Suggesting eating raw eggs took me back a bit too. Spend your money on Ina May's Guide to Childbirth instead. This book just wasn't that helpful to me."
5,Monthy must read,If you own or are involved with computers thisis a must read magazine. It can help with PC problemsand save you allot of money.
4,Good,"Does what it says and is kind of pricy but then again i am not a rich guy, so if you want some thing that is good, comprehensive and you have money on you its a good investment, (now i talk from a prespective of a person whoes first language isn't English)"
1,What a waste of money!!,"If you really need it for one year or 6 month, it is ok to have. But if you are planning to use for longer time, forget it!firt of all it is too expensive for what it does (Ipd is only $99 it does more...)Second speaking of words is crab...forget it!Third display is hard to see and not well lit!Fourth not customer freindlly (ease of use)Finally, if the battery is dead then it is gone forever!! you will lose eveything !!!Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good product with mirror design flaw and stung aftersales service,"The product has good features and suits for my growing kids. However, the hinge of the protective cover is very flimsy. It'd been broken before the package was opened. Franklin said they don't have that spare part! The retailer suggested me to refund, but my kids want to keep it. Franklin advised to send me a protective holder instead of its original style cover. I saw their document (description with photo). I accepted. Surprisingly, I received an old/used holder with different style and it doesn't fit (slightly smaller) my new device!! This is my third Franklin products I've bought. I was very shocked by what I was treated."
3,best on the market,"Pro: Lots of words, rarely you can find a word that is not included in this dictionary unless you are working in a very specialized field. Size is small. Definition is better than many desktop dictionaries.Con: Slow processing time, it sometime takes as much as 5 seconds to retrieve a definition. Key button is small, and not easy to press. Pronounciation is not very clear. But you can plug in your own earphone to get better quality. For most words, you don't see sample sentenses in a definition. There is no picture in a definition at all.Anyway this is one of the best on the market for an electronic dictionary. My ideal electronic dictionary should be,1. A large collection of vocabularies.2. Definition retrieving time is less than 0.5 second.3. Color screen, and include color picture in a definition for noun.4. Video clips in a definition for verb.5. Samples sentenses in definitions.6. Pronounciation is clear and loud.7. Buttons can easily pressed."
4,Speaker sound need improvement!!!,"Every thing is good but the speaker sound is not clear it needs improvement, specially for people english as a 2nd languge it is not easy to understand the pronouncations."
5,Worth my money,"I'll admit that there is some fault in that there is no pronunciation key, and that the speaking function isn't perfect, but the goods greatly outweigh the bads.the screen is large and is easily read. For those unable to read it, they should make the text bigger, as that will make it easier. It's invaluable in that it saves me loads of time when I need to search a word while reading a book.I think the best function of all is that it allows you to create lists of words, and then play games to memorize them.I have to learn many words for my Literature class and this function is very useful when I'm sitting on a toilet, or on a long ride."
4,Nice air pistol,"After a slight sight adjustment this shoots much more accurately than my ability to consistently hit anything. My wife and I enjoy tossing a stale cookie off the back deck and down the mountain 50 feet or so, then spending a half hour or so blowing it to bits. We hit about every third time or so. I'm not sure what that translates into a shot pattern. There are two things I would criticize: 1) there's a little pin that holds the cocking lever grip in place that tends to drift out over time, and 2) when they etched the serial number into the side they chipped off the paint where they did the etching. To me the later is just sloppy."
3,"Get a 1 Year subscription, should be enough","The magazine is targeted to the beginner/prosumer in my opinion. It's good and light reading. Full of ads though. I agree with the other reviewer that it gets repetitive after a while, especially if you photography skills are a big advanced."
1,stonewallco,I do not like auto-renewal for any type of subscription. The price of auto-renewal is always higher than special offers that are frequently available on line and by mail. I cancelled my auto-renewal.
4,Good Photography Magazine,"I won't repeat the other reviewers too much, but this is a good general purpose magazine. The biggest benefit is the magazine's product reviews. At just about $1/issue, this is a decent read. A portion of the magazine is dedicated to ads like most other publications, but the good content stays up front.They have some good travel pieces and will have some informative technical articles at times. The technical pieces vary in the degree of difficulty. Sometimes they are very beginner and other times they are more informative and advanced. Overall, the magazine is a good buy at the subscription price."
1,DO NOT ORDER THROUGH AMAZON,"Popular Photography is a great magazine. I've bought issues through my local bookstore for years. Then I saw the great prices offered here through Amazon. Unfortunately, my credit card was charged the price the price shown, but since then I have received several bills for the $6 difference from what was shown and Pop Photos regular price. They are now threatening to send me to collections. Another magazine I ordered was never recieved.Amazon told me to contact the publishers. Pop Photo could care less, they just want their $6 and the second magazine did not have a working number.This was a HORRIBLE situation and I would suggest just getting the card out of the magazine at the store and mailing it in."
5,Popular Photo,"Magazines arrived on time. There's really nothing else to add just to make up the requested twenty more words.Bla, bla, bla"
4,"Good, wish it was monthly","Good magazine, though I'm a purist and wish they'd drop the mirrorless stuff. Long live SLR.Wish it came out monthly, though there's some repeat of content as it is."
4,Another cool figure,"This figure is based on art from the Hellspawn series. With the way the series is drawn, there isn't much detail, so the designers really had to use their imagination to render this guy, and they did a great job of doing it. The spikes and armor give him a very scary and hard look. Another cool detail is the hooks that hang around his waist, a detail taken straight from the cover of Hellspawn. I think my favorite feature of this toy has to be the face. When you look at most of the photos online or on boxes of other figures, the face just looks like a dark shadow inside the cowel. In reality, the face is a skull with green eyes that hides in the shadow of the armor. It has a lot of articulation points for a McFarlane toy, but they aren't made for doing any real dramatic posing, which is typical of McFarlane toys."
3,"Small spawn!, big value!","Ok, so he is a little short, he probably gets teased by the army of darkness but this spawn, short or no, is actualy very cool and well worth the $$$. The detail is adequate, not eye popping but still good. He is durable but the joints may get loose with excessive play so hes probably best for display....or making fun of since he's so short.Recommended and worth the money. ..."
5,Blood Oath,"if you are one of the few people who have read this book when it was first released under the title ""The Initiation"" then you know you are in for a good who done in mystery.The pace of the story does go at a good clip and does lag in some parts but it quickly picks up pace again so you don't lose interest in the story.The surprising ending is a shocker but as a 'who's the bad guy' type mystery it is well written and keeps the reader guessing."
5,This game is fantastic for the first hundred times you play!,"My family and I love this game, when we first got it we played it ALL THE TIME. In fact we played it so much that we know all of the ""answers"" now. This game asks you to come up with objects or words that fit into a certain category and begin with the letter that was rolled on the die. It was fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone. I only wish that the makers would come out with a new addition that includes new categories so that my family and I can join in the fun again."
5,Great for Snowy Days,"When I was in college, this was the game we played in the dorms when we got snowed in. We'd all pool together our food and sodas and gather in the commons areas to play individually and as teams. It was always great fun, and if you are in college now or have a college aged kid, this would be perfect to take to school. Not only is it fun, but like most of the other reviewers have said, it builds vocabulary and is never the same twice."
4,Sky Fighters,"Think Top Gun with a Gallic twist. Impressive air to air action and photography, real - instead of CGI flying scenes, and best of all, no blatant violations of the laws of physics. Although the dialog is dbuued into English, the dubbing is done extremely well, and does not detract from the overall viewing experience.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Top Gun for its flying scenes."
3,French Top Gun,"Sky Fighters is essentially a French version of Top Gun. It's a rousing military adventure, following two pilots in the French air force, as they deal with stolen aircraft, betrayals within their own department, and battles with terrorists. The plot is rather convoluted. After a failed operation, in which a plane is intercepted and wrongly shot down, the pilots are court-martialed on trumped up charges. They are offered a chance for reinstatement if they agree to a dangerous secret mission. In the process, they uncover both a terrorist plot and corrupt business dealings on the part of government officials. They are taken prisoner in the Libyan desert and nearly shot, before staging a daring escape, and valiantly defeating the terrorists in the sky. The film isn't subtle, just enjoyable. It works best in a visual sense, with gripping scenes of aerial combat. This edition is available both in French, with English subtitles, and in English; it works better in the original French."
3,Great aerial scenes.,"I bought this specifically for the flight scenes. The plot, acting and english dubbing leave a lot to be desired, but beautiful aerial footage. Those parts of the movie deserve 5+ stars."
1,Stunningly Bad.,"If they would strip out all dialogue and plot my review would instantly add 3 stars. Agree with others that the flight sequences are great. The ""story"" is poorly conceived, written and performed. Watching with the French language track takes it up a notch (the English dubbing has cartoonish voices) but just a notch."
3,Good for Dummies,"Keep in mind this book has a ""dummies"" slant. It's a great beginner book and I own a copy. I recommend it. Lots of conversational plain english, funny cartoons, photographs, etc. But, buy another book as well to round out your knowledge. For example, Howland doesn't explain *why* you need an inner cover... just says it's part of the hive. He only provides *one* technique for queen introduction (albeit a good one), when there are several others. Then he perpetuates the myth that you should scrape a bee's stinger away rather than pinch it away (Discover magazine, et. al., now dispute this), and when discussing *moving* a hive, he leaves out the ""3 mile rule"" and the ""1 foot per day"" approach, etc. He suggests using motor oil moats to prevent ants (works great), but doesn't mention that vegetable oil and Tanglefoot work great also. Like I say, great book, buy it, but get some others too."
5,Best comprehansive guide for the beginning beekeeper!,"This book is fantastic. I just started last spring with one beehive. I have purchase five or six other books, but none have been as helpful as this one. It assumes that you don't know anything about beekeeping (that is me) and takes you through step by step and season by season. I have confidence that with the help of this book, I can keep my ""girls"" healthy and happy. I spoke to someone at our local beekeepers meeting who has been a beekeeper for almost 50 years. When I told him I was reading this book. He told me that it is one of the very best. I highly recommend this book for the beginning beekeeper."
4,lack of good pictures,sometimes pictures are worth 1000 words. tthis blook really needs some pictures to go along with the descriptions. it has a lot of information though.
2,Really limited,"I think I don't like these ""for dummies"" books. You will like this book if you want to be given a limited scope of information and want to be told how to do something so you don't have to think for yourself or choose between different ways to do things.Perhaps I'm the dummy for not figuring out that's what these books did. So not good for me but good if you want the above."
5,Great and important book!,A difficult book but to my way of thinking the most important book in metaphysics since Aristotle's. Whitehead gives real substance to our concepts of what is the true fundamental particle and thereby provides a basis for understanding the philosophical implications of both Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.
3,uplifting but difficult....,"Whitehead carries on the tradition of turgidity inaugurated by Hegel and even buys into the philosophy-as-system game; on the plus side, however, his key concepts make sense, especially his emphasis creativity and on reality as process. If you're new to Whitehead, read someone else's stuff about him before attempting this book."
3,Gore and Cheese - I enjoyed it,"You can't expect too much from a zombie pirate film, and the story was weak in areas, but overall the flick was a fun, cheesy horror movie. Some good scares, beautiful reality show chicks, and pretty good production value. I also think this was the last film by Neil Fredricks, the talented cameraman who shot ""The Blair Witch Project"".I'd beware of overly nasty reviews on a web site to purchase a DVD, but written by people who ""rented"" it (with a Hollywood address). Sure, it's not the best low budget horror film I've seen, but it's worth some blood, gore and Jessie Camacho!"
3,A Good Time Waster,"I watched the movie tonight, and I would say it is a cross between a reality show and a zombie film. It is a decent low budget film, but not great. I thought the main character, the pirate was a bit weak, they should have picked an actor with more screen presence. The plot was easy enough to follow, in fact it made me think of a Sci-Fy channel film done on a super low budget. I may have been too generous with the third star, but I recommend it because it is fun. I would call it a C film not a B film as well. Hey I paid less than a dollar for it here. It was well worth the money. Get some popcorn and some frozen pizza and a soda and watch it on some night."
4,This is for real pop punk fans,"Pop punk isn't supposed to be blink 182 or Green day or any other new flair of the year. Yeah some songs on here are retarded lyrically but that is Christy just having fun. If you really want a more intellectual and by that I mean in the way of lyrics than check out their album euthanize me. ""I'm too punk for the mainstream, an outcast of the punk scene I'm an individual I don't need a scene anyway live my life my rules my way"" great lyrics. Anyway I love this stuff cause I take it for what it truly is supposed to be fun music."
4,Great set to have in your toolbox.,I always like Lisle tools just because they have special bits without the special pricing. Quality is still there unlike the ones you get from Harbor Freight.
5,"Bop It is such a cool game, but don't let the dog near it!",We had a blast with bop it until our dog got a hold of it! It's a lot of fun & a good way to spend time with your family enjoying a good game! We played with it very often. It was amazing how our girls preferred it over other hot toys! It's a fun & exciting game...keeps you going and laughing! Offers a learning of coordination for kids.
4,a great world writer,"I have read Among Women Only in Turkish and I liked it very much.He is also my favourite Turkish writer's-Tezer Özlü- favourite writer.If anybody would like to contact me,I am in vessiz@hotmail.com"
5,A library worth having for every healer,"There are books which pretend to be a reference point, and there are those which not only are, but also exceed readers' expectations. These are some of those! Read them twice and heal the universe. A library worth having for every healer.(1). The Power of Divine: A Healer's Guide - Tapping into the Miracle by Tiffany Snow(2). Molecules Of Emotion: The Science Behind Mind-Body Medicine by Candace B. Pert(3). Energy Medicine by Donna Eden, David Feinstein, Brooks Garten, Caroline Myss(4). Reiki Energy Medicine: Bringing the Healing Touch into Home, Hospital and Hospice by Libby Barnett, Maggie Chambers, Susan Davidson(5). A Practical Guide to Vibrational Medicine : Energy Healing and Spiritual Transformation by Richard Gerber"
4,"Witch Hunt is fine addition to the ""pure"" historicals","There isn't very much I want to say. Most of the interesting things that I could say about this book are contained within its pages. The characters are well portrayed. The reader is desperately drawn into their plight and Lyons makes no pretense at maintaining any sort of mystery, instead utilising the sheer tragedy of the Salem witch trials to further capture the reader's interest. All in all a well thought out and interesting book."
2,disappointing,"I loved Dolly's original version and the Holy Roller mix of ""Peace Train"", both of which are on this cd. But the rest of this release is a sore disappointment. ""Walking on Sunshine"" and ""Two Doors Down"" seem particularly pointless given their terrible remixes, which manage to be both cheesy and harsh. ""Two Doors Down"", especially, is not only virtually unrecognisable, it's unlistenable. This cd is obviously an attempt to milk any dance floor credibility that Dolly established with ""Peace Train"", but it will surely slide right by anyone musically or dancefloor savvy."
5,Great Beauty Book!,"I really like the K.I.S.S. Guide to Beauty. It has a lot of good information in it.I also have the K.I.S.S. Guide to Weight Loss, too. I would recommend these two and think their other books in the K.I.S.S. series would be worth checking out."
1,Chock full of ads and useless info:,"This magazine certainly excells in making big money on its advertisements. Inbetween those are some cute type articles that have near zero value to anyone versed in psychology, or even those who aren't. Rather than printing, ""Why cant I get a date?"" or ""Why my husband is a lazy bum"" articles, they should try printing something of use, something that could actually prove useful to people interetsed in psychology."
1,Psychology Today,I bought this as a gift and learned that the recipient only received two of the copies out of the entire year.
4,Extremely poor workmanship,The shooting mechanism of the guns broke after 10 uses. Durability is extremely poor!!!
4,"Simple, Unpredictable, and Fun","The goal is to fire balls at certain objects and send them into your opponent's goal. It's very easy to play. From a strategic standpoint, it's a balance between putting balls in your shooter, aiming, and firing quickly. It's possible to get all the balls on your side, and it's neat to have that power. The balls are small and fairly easy to lose. I recommend this for children and for parents that want to play with their children."
2,Disappointed,"I had Crossfire as a child and loved it, so I was excited to see it show up on my son's Christmas wish list. However, we are very disappointed in this new version. My 7yo son cried the first (and therefore only) time he played it because it was too hard to fire the guns. He had to squeeze with both hands, which prevented him from being able to use one hand to reload. They often misfire and you have to jiggle them to get the balls to roll into place and that can mess up the whole playing surface. He also said it hurt his hand to pull the trigger. I tried to play the game to see how bad it was. I couldn't even finish the game because I developed a blister on my trigger finger. The next day, my whole hand was sore and the pain extended up my forearm. If we still had the packaging, we would return it."
2,Great until your kid steps on it,"I liked these at first but now I don't like them as much because my 3 year old sometimes likes to step on them causing damage to the trim they are screwed into. They cannot support the weight because they do not bend. I've also had one break, but the main issue is the damage when these get stepped on. Keep that in mind. It would be nice to see these in a flexible design but I'm not aware of any. Also, I wouldn't call these ""soft"".UPDATE 2010-02-10: Had another one break... so at least two have broken now. I have removed some other ones because I think they would cause more damage/risk than their worth if my son were to step on them or ""play"" with them."
2,2.5 stars,"This is one of those R&B albums from the 90's that you were feeling when it dropped, but when you listen to it a few years later it's repetitive, formulaic, bland and undistinguished. There are a few good songs on here and the rest is really nothing special. Same old stuff that everybody was making back then. Rodney Jerkins production, repeat chorus ten times. I don't really recommend buying this."
2,should be called amphibian magazine.....,"I am very disappointed in this magazine...I got my third issue and am cancelling today...I do not own giant tortoises from the Galapolos Islands...nor sea snakes....nor Bullfrogs....it seems every issue has more articles on animals no one really owns or animals that are not even reptiles...Most people own boas, pythons...colubrids..and the popular lizards....none of which are usually in the magazine..If I see an issue that has something in it that interests me..I will buy it but no more subscriptions to this magazine...If I want to learn more about big turtles from some island..I will check the encyclopedia....this magazine is not geared to the average herp keeper..."
1,Navy Seals: Insurrection Red,"Although the action in this book is good, everything else about it was lousy. From the ludicrous story line to the obvious lack of research about military acronyms. Having served in the Air Force for 10 years and worked with the Special Forces for the last two I couldn't believe anyone could come up with what I was reading. I almost quit reading this book 3 or 4 times, but I finished it to give a review of the whole book. From the first instance of an obvious lack of research in chapter 2 until I finally finished the book I had no respect for this author's work. I hope he doesn't do any more military works until he's done some serious research."
2,Not as creative as usual,"This book was not as good as I expected having thoroughly enjoyed his previous short story collections. Seeing as more than half of the stories are based on real life events, the creativeness and originality I have come to expect from a Jeffrey Archer short story were just not there. The stories came across basic and predictable, except for the few stories that were original. Actually quite a disappointing read overall."
2,"A Commercial for Avid, Circa 2000","Written like a bad stereo manual and padded with self-serving industry interviews, this title was an in-house product of Avid Press, and an unabashed commercial for their system as it existed at the turn of the century. Just one chapter was devoted to HD, with nothing useful about how to actually shoot in this medium, and there was no coverage of DV moviemaking either. The book was targeted towards Hollywood industry types who planned to shoot on 35 mm film, digitize their footage, and rent an expensive Avid editing suite for all post-production. Even Avid has had to rethink their business model in the intervening years, as competitors have offered more affordable software for desktop computers. Unless you just want an historical journey through obsolete editing systems, don't waste half a c-note on this book..."
3,"Good Tea, Not the Best Brand","I had been drinking tea for years then what with kids and loose leaf having become so difficult to find in my neck of the woods, stopped for a few years. Then I just picked it up again about a year ago when I found this item on Amazon. I am not sure if Twinings has changed its recipe or it's that I remember differently, but the tea tastes pretty weak. I would have kept grudgingly drinking it, though, had I not run into Bigelow and Tea Leaves. Even though those two brands are bagged, not loose, their flavor is much deeper and stronger than the Twinings loose leaf variety.So after all these years, I am switching to Bigelow. It's easier to find, too.As for Amazon's freshness, my tins arrived with their expiration date intact and well into the future."
3,Too Much Bergamot,The tea is fresh and the price is good. It is just not quite theEarl Grey that I am used to. this has has far too much bergamot inthe mix. Maybe my taste has changed over the past few years but Iseem to prefer the stronger cleaner tasting irish breakfast tea.I'll give this batch to my son.
4,"Great book, but . . .",It's an awesome book for anyone interested in getting into cave diving. But what happened to some of the chapters in the original manuscript?
2,outside Magazine verses Backpacker,Outside magazine sucks there's no product reviews in it or very little.When I took the Backpacker magazine there where lotsof outproduct reviews Im going to buy backpacker magazineagain for this reason.
2,For the fashion conscious gear collector that will never step outside!,"There is nothing worth reading in Outside any more. They seem to fill up their pages with ""Gear Guides"" and half their magazine looks like a product catalog (with boots and jackets that most of us can't afford). Occasionally there used to be good articles, but even those seem to have disappeared. Outside is now just a magazine that is below mediocre and attempts to disguise its fluff with flashy graphics and self aggrandizing language.I thought it funny when they started sending me free issues of GO, their attempt at creating an upscale version of Outside for the rich people. I opened it up and it was filled with more gear guides, except the gear was even more expensive.If you are truly an outdoors person, pick up an issue of Backpacker. It will inspire you to get outside and explore vs. Outside mag, which just wants to inspire you to buy from their sponsors."
2,Stale,"If you like Jack Johnson,Lance Armstrong, Kelly Slater (or the blonde surfer) this is the magazine for you- you'll be seeing alot of them. I used to subscribe to this magazine for years, but it became 'the same old thing', so I quit."
4,Good family game night game!!!,We bought this for our 8 year old son and he LOVES it! Very fun and the game goes fast! Great for the family game night!
1,Garbage!!!,"This game fell apart after we got out of the box. I didn't even get a chance to play this with my five year old before it fell apart. Be careful, I wouldn't get this if you have children who are rough on their toys..."
5,A wonderful story for the whole family!,"I would recommend this one for the whole family because theres action,adventure,romance,and love for a grandson from his grandfather! It also shows our youth that a book can be just as entertaining as any video game,and encourages kids to read and grandparents as well as parents to read to their children!"
5,BETTER THAN THE PRINCESS BRIDE!,"""The Princess bride"" is definately the best fantasy adventure movie ever. These movie's that America release today are unoriginal and predictable. BUT if you absolutely loved the movie and the book than i insist that EVERYONE reads the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. i can't actually write down in words a description of how good these books are because i feel i won't be expressing it in a good enough way to give them the true praise they deserve. All i can say is trust me. It's full of adventure, action, and especially love. But of course alot more. I read these books, and especially my favourite bits over and over again. If you don't believe me e-mail me and i'm sure i'll convince you to buy the whole series."
5,"Excellent, A Must See Film!",If you have not seen this then you better because if you don't then you are a communist sympathizer........
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER,"This movie is the best. It's great for kids and adults alike and has great actors and actresses. It's funny, exciting, adventuresome, and with Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, and many others you can't go wrong. It's great!"
5,"Score one for ""Twoo Luv""!","The Princess Bride is a LOL funny movie from start to finish. You have an all-star cast that are up to their necks in hilarity. Andre The Giant's character can't stop rhyming, Wallace Shawn portrays a kidnapper/poisoner extrardoinnaire and there are 'rodents of unusual size' just to mention a few.There are so many memorable scenes in this film that it would be impossible to begin to list them all. But even with all the humor, there are some serious moments as well... events involving Mandy Patinkin's character (""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!"") and how one should NEVER give up on true love... even if you are a princess and he is a farm boy. :)This is one that is recommended for all."
5,The best,This is truley the best love story ever told. I stumbled apon this movie by accident. I glad I did
4,It's a great family movie.,"My kids love this movie, and I admit it, I love it, too. We have watched it over and over. I love the way it is like an old fairytale but with a modern twist in the telling of it. There are too few movies like this out there."
5,The Princess Bride,This is a great movie to sit back and enjoy for whole family. Great fun to watch with a good plot. Acting was well done!
5,Loved it!,"I love fractured fairy tales anyway, and when you throw Billy Crystal in the mix, it's even funnier. I have not yet read the book (shame on me) but it's on my list now. The performances are excellent all around, but Crystal's character will retain a spot at the front of my memory (a very cluttered place) forever!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,huh?,"after all the hype over this film, i was ready for something really special. instead, i found pb to be a silly kids film about something called 'true love', whatever that is. the only good thing about this film is andre the giant. he's a pretty good actor. but he is a wrestler, so what's new? watch it with your kids, but be prepared to be disappointed."
3,Love it? or Hate it? Tough call...,"The Princess Bride was a good movie...in a weird sort of way. It was action filled and very interesting, but there are some scenes were you catch yourself scratching your head and raising your eyebrows. The movie is very different from the book, in a good way. IF YOU'VE READ THE BOOK, HATED IT, AND VOWED NEVER TO WATCH THE MOVIE,(like I happened to do), you might want to rethink it. The movie is good, but it is probably not suitable for young children. Rent it, see it, but probably don't buy it."
2,HAS DEEP STORYLINE BUT TRIVIALIATY NOT MY STYLE.,"Don't know what the hype is about this movie. Didn't find it very funny, found it stupid and nonsensical. Gave it two stars for some decent scenery, other than that really gag me with a spoon type storyline--- just glad it was over with and I made it through. Maybe its just not my style, I like things that have meaning not a farce based on real life. This movie gets a thumb down, really putrid."
2,Sweet dreams.,"Children's story based on William Golding's tongue-in-cheek, wink-wink novel. The movie tries to have a similar feel to the book, with the result that it's pretty smart-allecky for children's entertainment . . . and yet, it's not really sophisticated enough to be considered ""adult"" entertainment, either. The problem for this may not be Rob Reiner's direction, but probably the source material. At any rate, tongue-in-cheek swashbucklers have been done to death in cinema, from the silent films of Fairbanks to Indiana Jones, and *The Princess Bride* adds little to what is already a stale repetoire of stunts and gags. Another demerit is the look of the picture: the sets are cheap, looking rather like settings for a TV program rather than a movie (Reiner's backgroud, of course, is TV, e.g., *All in the Family*). The static compositions, proscenium set-ups, and relentless close-ups also bespeak the work of an amateur from TV-Land. But whatever -- the kids'll like it."
5,"A pure, swashbuckling pleasure","The luminous, petulant princess Buttercup, Inigo Montoya, The Man In Black,...and Andre The Giant. What else is there? This is a classic fairy tale, with Peter Falk, Billy Crystal as the hysterical Miracle Max, Wallace (My Dinner with Andre) Shawn and the divine Robin Wright-Penn. Babes, villians, magic, heros and humor. Truly one of my favorites of all time. Sweet, playful, romatic, fanciful, just a ton of fun. A movie you'll quote, and perfect strangers will smile in common appreciation and understanding. I also strongly recommend the book. It's totally hysterical and well written, a delicious page turner."
3,Great in bluray; 5.1 sound not so great,One of my favorite movies. Loved the beautiful scenes in bluray. The sound in 5.1 kept halting and dropping to 5.0 and then back. Missed a lot of good dialog and it was very disconcerting.
5,A Loveable Fairytale,"This delightful fairytale is one of those wonderful childhood memories and a joy for the whole family. With a great mix of humor, blatant melodrama, loads of adventure, and a magnificent cast, ""The Princess Bride"" really has it all.The movie is narrated by a Grandpa (Peter Falk) telling a bedtime story to his grandson (Fred Savage.... you know, the 'Wonder Years' kid). The star of the show is Cary Elwes, who plays the simple stable boy Westley that falls madly in love with Buttercup (Robin Wright). The lovers are separated of course, and Westley is presumed dead, lost at sea. Buttercup, now engaged to the thoroughly evil Prince Humperdinck, is kidnapped by a motley band of rogues with the mysterious Dread Pirate Roberts (*coughs* Westley anyone?) in hot pursuit.The ensuing misadventures and comedy make for a memorable movie experience that can be repeatedly enjoyed. This isn't the most amazing movie ever made, but it is mostly amazing, and highly reccomended."
4,...and I mean it!,"Poetic, Funny, Star-Studded, family friendly film. What more do you need to know? If I told you anything else it would be cheating you of seeing it for yourself. (which I hope you will do)."
5,Timeless Classic,"I saw this movie years ago, when it first came out. It has since become a favorite. Great story full of romance, fun, intrigue, and lessons learned about love and life. Excellent movie I'd recommend anyone to see. Both the young and young at heart, boys or girls, will enjoy this movie."
4,Amazing Movie!,"This movie has everything a movie needs! Laughter, Suspense, Love, Perseverance... etcBut... Being an older movie when watching it on blu-ray, you can really tell when the background is fake and the make-up is cheaply done...But the movie is still an awesome movie!"
5,Almost ruined my second wedding ceremony!,"Howdy! I'm not writing a review of the movie, but perhaps the anecdote I'm about to relay, will serve as one.We all know the plot of ""The Princess Bride"", all the various characters, and all the various quotes attributed to them. My son, now 30, can do a dead-on imitation of the priest.I was married, for a second time, in June 1997. I warned my son that he'd better not start in with ""mawwrige"" during the ceremony. I let him get away with it during the rehearsal. He walked me down the aisle and then stood in back of me while the real ceremony went on. I heard him, as did the others standing with us, whisper ever so quietly....""mawwridge""...and it was just about all over. It was all we could do to keep a straight face!Just wait until it's his turn to be married. There's a long list of us in line to take revenge! LOL"
5,Inconceivable!,"This is my favorite romantic movie of all time! It has humor, action, suspense and a great (maybe a little cliche but cute) ending. It's good for both kids and adults, a rare find. It is full of funny lines that I still laugh at every time I see it. The acting it great, the characters seem real yet are still fantasy-like at the same time. I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie because that would be INCONCEIVABLE!!!!!"
5,This was so hilariously funny!!!!!,"I absolutely love this movie! I just discovered this movie a few months ago and I have seen it already like 50 times! My friend and I have memorized all the lines and whenever we see it we crack up at all the jokes! it's so good! Omg, it has to be my favorite movie of all times!!!"
4,Very funny and well written romantic comedy,"""The Princess Bride"" is a very funny and well written romantic comedy that also has some action and adventure. It's now on Blu-ray, but there's little need to watch it in hi-def. The movie was low budget and it stands out because of its writing and comedy rather than its visuals. Most of the scenery is forgettable, and very little effort was made to show it off. The medieval castle and costumes look good, but they also look good in standard definition. Some sets and animals look embarrassingly fake. The Blu-ray disc has some good making of features. Reviewed 3/19/2009 after watching on Blu-ray."
3,A must see,"For every one but me. The video the book left me feeling like I didn't ""get it"". I must say it has quite a following- I have never met anyone else who didn't thoroughly enjoy it."
5,The best movie ever!!!,"This movie is a great take on the Princess Bride book. Cary Elwes make an excellent Wesley. If you love romance, sports, and giants, this movie is for you!!! You will love it, I guarantee!!!!"
5,Good Movie,"Came to us pretty quick, well protected in the mail. Great movie, of course! Who can resist a true classic!"
5,Funny stuff,"If your kids have not seen this, then get it now and show them a movie they will love for ever."
2,"It was an o.k. movie, but could have been better! WAY MORE!","It was somewhat o.k., but anyone who had a mind of there own would have known who the guy was. I mean DUHHH! who would be so stupid not to guess it by the way he acted. By the way, why are there people reading the book, who needs it when you have the story. I'm outty!!!"
1,Double Dip,How many times do we have to buy this movie it has been released 3 times counting this one.FirstThe Princess Bride (Special Edition)Second with 2 editions coversThe Princess Bride - Buttercup EditionThe Princess Bride - Dread Pirate EditionPlus this New gimme a break
2,A little slow for my taste,"If you enjoy a slower read this book might be for you. I read ""Red Waters"" and was fascinated, so I decided to give this a try. For me it was not the same, as I enjoyed the other book very much.The subject deals with a woman who was Mormon, but her and husband are not practicing. They fall away from religion and get a divorce, and she leaves to try and find herself as she roams over California and Mexico. If this subject matter sounds interesting to you then you could very well enjoy it more then I did. The pace was a bit slow and many situations void of the emotional thunder I usually enjoy in a book.However, not everyone likes what I do, so thus the suggestion of interest.If you are anxious to try this author, or interested in unorthodox Mormon fiction, then I suggest ""Red Water"" which Freeman takes an unapologetic and sacreligious look at polygomy, the churches early practice of plural marraige."
2,"An honest, but depressive book with a hurried ending.","The story is a very honest, depressing, and painfully detailed description of one woman's journey through childhood and youth in Utah and a mid-life attempt to flee the banality of her life by heading for California. But, the depressing and banal trend in her life continues right until a hurried but uncharcteristically happy ending !The book is an intersting commentary on human nature and on rural life in Utah."
5,"Fast Paced, try the electronic version","This is a good game, even if people are not too focused or are slghtly inebriated. I have played both the card version and the electronic version. Both are fine, but I prefer the electronic version. It is self-contained in one unit, the words are larger and easier to read. The card version words are tiny and can be hard to read, even with the magnifying lense."
5,Game Fan,"We played this game over the Thanksgiving holiday with family members ranging in age from 7 to 60. We had two teamswith as few as 3 people on a team to sometimes as many as 7 per team. It was a blast. When the words were too hard for the youngest we just quickly passed the disk to the next one on our team, or someone on the other team gave them a quick clue as to what the word was. We couldn't get enough of the game. It makes you think fast and learn some things about those around you as they throw clues at you. Our son's girlfriend who is 17 always got the words that had to do with reproduction. It was a riot. I would highly recommend this one."
4,captan,"great fun , couples game for sure even the kids can catch on right away if you can read u can play"
4,Hilarious,"We played Catch Phrase on New Year's Eve and laughed until we cried! It was an hilarious game. However, you could sure tell we were all middle aged and older as we all had to use bifocals to read the tiny writing used by the manufacturer of this game! I've never played the second edition or used the card version of the game, but perhaps they all have this fault. With all the difficulty reading the clues, we still had a marvelous time!"
3,Pretty good beginner workout dvd,"This is a pretty good beginner DVD. I'm recommending it to my Mom's church and to my sister-in-law and her kids. We are going to get them all hooping in the next 2 months! For myself, I've been doing this stuff since I was a kid. If you are wanting to do the ""fancy"" stuff, this is not the DVD you want. This is a good very low impact workout, not something to get you ready to perform. It HAS inspired me to start hooping again! Some of her costumes are super-cute, too. I'm looking forward to a more advanced DVD from Christabel! (She also has an infectious laugh!)"
1,Terrible hooker workout,"""HoopGirl"" talked and acted SO phony that she got on my nerves too much to watch. I could not take her phony personality, horrible voice, and hooker outfits long enough to watch the whole thing. I sold my copy. She dressed like a stripper and talked like a Nursery School Show host. It was just to awful to take. I was utterly annoyed and grossed out."
3,exercise video only,"This is specifically for keeping the hoop on your hips only.The very end of the DVD shows some arm tricks during a performance piece, but not enough camera angles to learn it. Poor costuming as well. It is as if you are a really good hooper, you have to look like a cheap tramp."
1,What Outlet Cover?,"I never received this, and attempts to reach the seller went unanswered. I guess I'm the victim of Internet trickery, but I didn't lose much, and 1 out of 50 transactions isn't too bad."
4,not meant to be objective.,"This book is not meant to be objective or positivist in any way. In that respect, Bourgois wrote an incisive, true to life account of life in East Harlem during the beginnings of the crack epidemic. Criticizing the author for not being objective misses the point--this is meant to be an ethnography that does not attempt to eliminate personal influence, but to account for it and analyze its meaning. If Bourgois were trying at all to be objective, he would not have included his own conversation in the book."
4,in search of repect review,great insight into street culture in a very poor area.Bourgois takes great strides to explain and put in perspective to the culture and motive for selling drugs in Harlem. recommended read for anybody in high school and older
3,Parallels the trajectory of rock and roll,"No other magazine more closely parallels the history of rock and roll. It's own history like the music it covers has gone through numerous transitions over the years. Rolling Stone has grown from a gritty cutting-edge journal that covered the rock and roll revolution from a run-down loft office in San Francisco to a slick, corporate, money-making machine. That said, Rolling Stone has in-depth articles on the latest and greatest in rock and roll as well as historical pieces, some political articles, and lots of great photos. If you're into rock and roll for the rebellion, don't buy Rolling Stone, you'll need to save all your money to buy a time machine. But if you want to know what's going on in the infotainment industry, this is a great place to start."
2,"If only RS was still about Reality, and not reality.","I just cancelled my subscription to RS after 'Snookie' was featured on the cover. If this is really the direction in which RS would like to travel, then I will not be going. If only the magazine would and could maintain the integrity it once maintained I would still be a fellow traveler. Well done with the real news and investigative imagination, but Snookie and Rhiana as cover stories will just not fly with me."
1,old issues sent,I am not reviewing the content of the magazine - rather I have issue with the fact that once I purchased the subscription I got in the mail 3 older issues - as if they had extras that didn't sell and took my subscription as an opportunity to unload old unsold issues. I surely wasn't interested in the issue from 2 nor 3 months ago.Poor service.
1,Rolling Stones Mag Died in the Middle 80's,"The big difference is on the magazine timing. I use to read Rolling Stones to discover about bands I didn't know. Now is all about what you've seen or smell everywhere else. Nothing new, usually, is happening here. If you need to know about entertainment, that's what Rolling Stones covers now, get an Entertainemnt Weekly subscription, it's less bulky. Britney Spears on the cover...for christ sakes!"
1,"Used to be decent, now it's pretty much junk","This used to be a pretty decent music magazine. Not the best that was out there, but still decent. However, Rolling Stone has taken a huge nose-dive in the past ten or so years. I'm not sure I'd even really call it a music magazine anymore. It's more a pop-culture magazine that panders to teeny-boppers. A music magazine's main focus should be music, but RS has over the years started including more and more articles on TV shows, movies, politics, etc and less and less on music...especially less and less on good music. If you want a magazine on pop-culture go with Entertainment Weekly. It, at least, has a bit of taste here and there and doesn't spout off about politics. If I want politics, I'll read the newspaper or watch CNN. I don't buy music magazines for politics. I buy them for music. If you want a good music magazine, this isn't the place to look anymore."
2,Please put this mag out of its misery,"I would like to throw another handful of dirt on this magazines grave. I remember when Rolling Stone mattered, it wrote about real rock and roll. It interviewed interesting people, not the flavors of the month we now get dosed with. When brit,linse,justin start making covers...readers start packin.. If Rolling Stone editors had any decency youthanasia would have been practiced after Kurt Cobain made the cover wearing a tshirt reading ""corporate mags suck"".For real rock and roll magazines try MOJO or Q .."
1,Better uses for this magazine than reading it....,"Rolling Stone magazine, like a lot of the ""rock"" music coming out today, is just a trashy shell of what it used to be. Best used as a bathroom tabloid, then after one spends 5 minutes glancing through it, use the pages for bath tissue, or use with glass cleaner to clean the bathroom mirror. If you are one of the people who likes getting attention by tattooing and piercing your body all over the place, and having spiked dyed purple hair while wearing tough-looking black leather jackets and boots with chain links, this magazine might be right up your alley. This magazine has gotten THAT BAD."
1,Sold out like MTV,"You want the scoop on music than look somewhere else. Rolling Stone has been going downhill ever since they gave Nirvana's Nevermind a 7 out of 10 rating. They gave Weezer's Pinkerton, which today is rated among the best of the best of the best cds ever, the worst CD of the year award in 96. Yeah, you heard me, the best cd of 96 (according to me and many other people) got worst cd of the year in 1996 by Rolling Stone. And today its only getting worse. So listen to the other reviews and get another magazine unless you are a teen bopper - heck - still dont get it."
5,Rock!,Can't go wrong with this. Keeps me up to date plus the articles are interesting. Rolling stones been a favorite of mine for some time now and will have them around longer.
2,It used to be the counter-culture's voice...,"I decided to try Rolling Stone again after a nearly 10 year absence. This is a rag, only occasionally hinting at its once-greatness. The most recent issue looked like an issue of Maxim (great, I guess if you've got the iq of a 12-year-old boy, not so great for a grown up) I'm really not interested in the latest pop-culture boy-girl-band wannabe, nor am I interested in the sexual escapades of a teenage girl...And if I WAS, I wouldn't want to read about them in THIS magazine, which used to be about art and culture. Why bother? There's no politics, no class and no challenge to this.It used to be the counter-culture's voice...now it's got no culture at all.Good-bye RS!Follow up...What happened? I got a free subscription to RS, so I came back. Insightful political thought has returned to these pages. I'm so glad to see some of the old RS back. I'm glad it's no longer Maxim-ized."
1,There are 2 pages worth reading per magazine,"This just might be the biggest joke of a magazine I've ever read. Not only is the magazine horribly off base with its music reviews, but they have braindead idiots trying to write political articles as well.The 2 pages that are worth reading in the magazine are the 2 pages that Peter Travers gets for movie reviews. So read those 2 pages in the newsstand and then put it back. Don't even spend a penny for this magazine."
2,Boring Stone! ok that was bad,"The only reason I am giving this magazine 2 stars is that the articles on music artists and movies are pretty strong. The thing that I mostly dislike of this magazine is that the CD reviews are horrible. Whoever reviews the CDs must listen to 5 seconds of each song and find the lyrics of one song to critique the whole album.I also do not like that the magazine only reviews the most popular albums of the time. If lesser-known and/or underground artists are not able to get their CD reviewed, they will never be put out to the public and the public will not be able to find new artists to listen to. I recommend a magazine strictly for music and music-related media, such as Blender, which is very entertaining."
1,The magazine and the band have a lot in common,"For one they were both good when they started. They also had something to say and weren't afraid to speak their minds. Then they both sold out... In the late seventies the band made a disco album which ruined their entire career, and made an enemy out of me. When Kurt Cobain died in '94 the magazine became extremely corporate and just a lame rip-off of People (which is also terrible). That 100 greatest guitarists list was bulls**t. Van Halen at 70? I didn't see Cantrell and Tony Iommi (the greatest metal guitarist ever) was at 86! Kurt Cobain and Kirk Hammett (two extremely overrated and bland guitarists) were at 12 and 11! The rappers list also had that hypocrit Eminem (one minute he's a homophoeb, the next he's a homoSEXUAL) in their top 10. This company needs to stop trying and go away, like The Rolling Stones did a little while ago..."
5,the bible of popular music,"Although the magazine seems to be heading more and more towards whatever is popular instead of whatever is good, the magazine most definitely deserves a good read. Their editorials about politics are also very interesting.if you want to find out the latest on popular music, up and coming music, and the state of the world at the same time, read Rolling Stone.I also suggest reading Rock Music Review (an online, independent view of new music)."
3,I DID NOT ORDER IT!!!,I DID NOT REVIEW IT OR ORDER IT AGAIN. I HOPE YOU FIX THIS ERROR OR I WILL DISPUTE IT AGAIN AS I ALREADY DID ONCE
1,Rolling Stone magazine subscription,"I was given an incentive opportunity to purchase the famous and great magazine, Rolling Stone, 5 weeks ago and asked today to review my subscription. I would be happy to do so however as of this date, I have yet to receive my first copy. Pretty frustrating!"
3,Dumb process for auto-renewals,The product is fine but the amazon process for handling subscriptions really stinks since you can't change or cancel online. You have to call an 800#. What's up with that?
1,Busted on a automatic purchase!,I got screwed on a automatic purchase. This is how they sell print magazines now in a digital world. It's an old trick and I should have known. If you want to take advantage of $1 deals you need to be vigilant to unsubscribe in time.
1,Waaaay past it's shelf life,What was once the go-to magazine for music has fallen so far off the mark that putting a bullet through it today would still not excise the last fifteen years of shilling fashion and celebretards. Zero credibility these days...much like an athlete hanging on way past his prime and embarassing himself.
2,I cancelled my subscription after 18 years - RS is dead,"You might as well read Vibe, People or Spin--they're all the same editorially as the current shell that is called Rolling Stone. The quality that used to define RS as a distinguished platform for thoughful cultural reflection is gone."
1,too cool for words,"At least that's what the people behind this magazine think.Doesn't everything that once is great suddenely go down in quality for irrelevent reasons? I used to like it back then, of course. For example, when they named R.E.M.'s ""Murmur"" the best album of the year.For this year, you can probably expect Justin Timberlake's new one to recieve that oh-so prestigious honor."
2,Rolling Stone....old,"I'm not sure why when my first issue arrived, two previous issues arrived as well. This is NOT what was explained when I paid for the subscription. What good is outdated information to me? I'm not sure what the reason is for this. In fact, I bought the John Lennon issue over the holidays at an airport for plane reading and received this issue as a past issue. Not sure why that was?"
3,RollingStoned,"Great price on the subscription but the magazine seems to be lacking so far. First I got three issues in the first few weeks, nothing like sending you a few unwanted past issues to speed up your expiration date. Next the articles lack substance. On the plus side the reviews are good."
2,I miss the old rolling stone,"Have been an RS fan/customer since middle school in the mid-90s...not too impressed with where it's gone in the last few years...while i know it was done to save money, definitely NOT a fan of changing their size/format"
1,"If you are older than 14, this magazine is NOT for you!","I have been a long time subscriber to Rolling Stone. For the longest time they actually talked about music (Like when MTV used to play music). Now it seems to be marketed toward the Teen Beat crowd. If you love the Jonas Brothers and Adam Lambert, this is your magazine. Occasionally they still have a good article or two. Expect lots of stories about Nick Lachey and that dork married to Britney Spears. Also be aware that Rolling Stone thinks that the Jonas Brothers are on par with the Beatles. The last 20 issues I read ALL had an article about the Jo-Bros.This once great magazine is now horrible!"
1,What Happened to Rolling Stone?,"I have to agree with all these other reviewers. Rolling Stone used to be good, but now it's really, really bad. The musicians they write about are weak. What happened? They used cover great artists like Lennon and Dylan. But nowadays they keep hyping up annoying people like M&M and Justin Timberlake. Besides you can't barely get thru the magazine because there are too many ads. I remember Rolling Stone when it had the best writers like Cameron Crowe and Ben Fong Torres, but now they are long gone. It's sad because this was once the best magazine out there. Now I don't recognize it anymore. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Blue dye,"I'm comparing it to the algaecide plus by aqua chem. I put aqua chem in over the mustard algae; it sank directly down to the algae in a white cloud. I immediately saw the dead algae pieces float to the surface. After two bottles of aqua chem brand, algae was left on only one side. Decided to try Kem Tek (cheaper) put it in two hours ago, directly over the algae. It did not sink to the bottom where the algae is. It simply floated away. Algae is still there. Dead algae nor blue dye is anywhere to be seen. I WOULD NOT buy another bottle of this. ""Two hours not enough time?"" Compared to aqua chem more than enough."
2,Weak Lynch.,"Unquestionably my least favorite David Lynch film. There are aspects of David Lynch's work I enjoy very very much, and aspects that just annoy and/or bore me. I thought highly of Eraserhead and the Elephant Man, and the Twin Peaks that I've seen, enjoyed Lost Highway and Dune, was lukewarm on Blue Velvet, and just flat-out disliked this one, Wild At Heart. I tried hard to find something interesting and/or rewarding in it, but the struggle was in vain. Of the two stars I give it, one is there just for at least being original and unusual, and the other is there for a couple of genuinely hilarious lines. But on the whole this film seems painfully vapid and artless."
1,Terrible !,"hi..I have no idea where the positive reviwes came from, i mean this movie was terrible, it was pointless!I think it is highly over rated, very very boring, drags alot and pointless movie.people speak of surrealizm and bizzarness, and that it made the movie worthwhile, well, it sure is bizzare, but in a really bad way.Violence ? what violence ? just one or two scenes of shoot outs and they call it violence !!! i've seen much more before !!And whats with the repitive sex scenes, again pointless !!its basically a story of two couples enjoying themselves and running and going on a poitnless road trip, nothing more or less, no plot !!And whats all the hype about the wizard if OZ reference, it didn't add anything special to the movie !!!Sorry, but i can't see what is good about this awful movie !!!i want my money back please !!!"
1,A Waste of Celluloid,"Not much here to think about at all. Nicholas Cage's worst showing ever, due entirely to an anemic story-line and shallow characters. I didn't care about these people at all. The off beat violence and poor character development led me to one boring conclusion - yawn."
4,One of lynchs underrated classics,"The thing with this film is that even some die hard lynch fans don't like it (i'm not a die hard fan, but I still can't figure out what why the hell he made dune). Too mainstream? hardly. This is definately a weird period in lynchs career, he was trying formal narratives, and using storys, unlike ""Eraserhead"", a great film, but essentially it goes nowhere. He made that, completely surreal, then tried this, which has a moving story, then decided it would be best to stick with surreal and did Lost Highway. I'm saying I like all these films, just this one doesn't get the respect it deserves. It's not as weird as all his other films, but weird nonetheless. Great performances all around, and in the end when cage is beat up by the gang for calling them homosexuals, his apology is one of the greatest lines he's ever delivered."
2,"An otherwise good film, butchered","The original Australian theatrical release of ""Wild at heart"" stated with a short scene where Nicholas Cage is seen having sex with Laura Dern's mother in a toilet cubicle. This scene has been excised from the Region 4 DVD and instead the film starts with an unsubstantiated accusation of this, just before the fight.If your copy is missing this scene, it is cut."
3,Elvis? More Like Andy Kauffman...,"Cage acts more like Andy Kauffman than Elvis in this movie. Crappy ending also. Was waiting for Cage to break into a chorus of ""I'm a Pepper,you're a Pepper"". The violence is the only saving grace in this film. Not a very good example of David Lynch's talents. This one will never rank among his best work. If you're a David Lynch fan like myself, Wild At Heart will more than likely disappoint you."
2,"Good, but","I ordered this book for a book club reading. It is paired with March by Geraldine Brooks. Little Women arrived yesterday, just one week before my book club meeting. I wish it had come sooner since I ordered it about a month ago."
1,yikes!,"You know what I love about this little morality play, oh sorry-MOVIE is that it is SO INCREDIBLY SUBTLE, wow, you had to look really, really close to see the message. Are you getting my sarcasm? good cause I'm laying it on thick. (a quote from Tommy Boy, an Oscar contender compared to this heap) Uh, do I really need to say more? What a typical load of crap this country pours out, I can just hear the studio heads yelling: ""Lay it on thick guys, they love it when you smack 'em across the face with it!"""
3,"Haunting Imagery, Bad Acting....","Stigmata is a decent little horror film. The haunting imagery of stigmata and possession was spooky. The story was decent, ending was okay but nothing special. My main issue was with the lead, Patricia Arquett; I thought she was bad in this film, a lot of her dialogue seems forced and emotionless and just boring. Everyone else was decent. The music in was bad, the club music should've stayed in the club scenes. It would've benefited from a better soundtrack.Overall, its creepy and has some great scares, but I wasn't a big fan of the acting. I recommend checking it out, at least a rental. As of 7/9/12, Stigmata is available on Netflix Streaming (the subtitles when they spoke in foreign languages was cut off during my stream.)It has some disturbing images, violence and blood, and partial nudity."
5,An amazing experience,"When I first entered the cinema hall to watch Stigmata for the first time, I had no idea how intense the experience would be. I confess I was expecting a regular exorcist-like drama, but the sotry and its charachters really impressed me, specially Patricia Arquette, as the regular non-catholic girl who's faced with a ""miracle"" and, of course Gabriel Byrne, as the catholic Father torn between his faith and the mysteries of science. It is definetely a MUST, and one of the best movies of the year."
1,utter propaganda; disgusting,"I give ths movie a negative 50, not the 1 star I have listed. this movie did nothing more than slash the Catholic Church in every way it could. I was so mad that i had to leave the theater, something i rarely do. It claims that the Church is nothing more than brainwashing people into thinking that the only way to heaven is through them. this movie actually rips on all organized Christian religions, but especially Catholicism. Even non-Catholics should be outraged at this movie for ripping on Catholics, after-all, if a movie did nothing but rip on Blacks or Jews would we not boycott that movie, of course, so why not with Catholics? Lets write letters to the studio that made this and tell them we are going to boycott their garbage from now on."
2,Supposed to be a horror/thriller. Intstead it's just silly.,"Despite a good performance by Patricia Arquette, cast as a working-class hairdresser in Pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a souvenir and somehow experiences Christ's wounds, this film is a loser. The subject itself might have been intriguing if it was anyway near what Catholic theology actually is, but the filmmaker got it all mixed up and targeted the film towards the outrageous and impossible. There's supposed to be a conspiracy to keep Christ's words from the faithful and there's also some sort of satanic possession going on which keeps the special effects people busy. Gabriel Byrne plays the priest who tries to help her and also is attracted to her, but he's just about as believable as the rest of this awful story. It's true that the film did move fast and held my interest, but only because it was so strange. I give this a ""thumbs down"". Don't waste your time."
2,"Sorry, but no.","I'm sorry but this movie was very disappointing! First of all, I've read and heard a lot about how this is ripping off the exorcist. Well, I did see some elements of the exoricist present, but nothing major. The movie was very boring though. I could see a pathetic attempt to be scary, but it just didn't work. Now one element that was lacking was a good soundtrack. The Omen worked partially because of a great soundtrack. This movie could not keep my attention because it left me bored. The music did not build anything. Secondly, the whole point of the movie was left unanswered. It ended with that one special message, but why did the priest possess that girl? What was his purpose? I wonder if the writers even know! From what I saw, I think a bunch of people recognized that movies in this genre have done well in the past and that they would try to score off it as well. Sorry fellas, but you failed."
1,terrible movie,"I don't know excactly what to say about this movie. I watched it with a girl who is really into weird and abnormal movies. By the end of the movie I could hardly get her to say anything. She was so freaked out that I thought she was in shock. I don't usally let things affect me like that. But the way i felt about the movie was that it was of the Devil himself. It left me with such a bad feeling that I wasn't sure what to believe. I am not a real religious person but I know with out a doubt that what I saw on that movie was pure blasphemy. I have never used that word before but that is the only word I could think of after I watched this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone for any reason, It is the worst movie I have ever seen.......I would love to discuss why I feel this way with any one who wishes, e-mail me at wop2@hotmail.com...."
2,Not enough info for young adults,"This collection of biographies of ten early scientists(580 b.c.-850 a.d.) is probably only useful for elementary researchers or very low-level middle school students. The information is not in-depth,although it is presented in very readable and entertaining chapters. Granted that little information may be available on these scholars, the chapters barely mention the contributions each made outside of science (like Aristotle). Each scientist does have a physical depiction included and some other black and white pictures are scattered throughout the text. The index is very small, but probably useful enough for the amount of information presented."
1,Worst product,I lost all my money on this one as it didnt work at all. I guess its just not good enough.
3,Read description Carefully!!,If you are looking for a cable to go between your PC/laptop and your LCD TV...(VGA>Component)....****this is likely not the product for you****. That is what I was looking for...but I didn't read all the details. Most computers don't have the ability to output a component signal. Would not work with my PC (dell) and LCD TV (vizio).If you're using this cable w/ a projector...it will apparently work. Cable construction appears to be very good.
2,wrong connections but good cable,"i ordered this cable because my Acer laptop does not have an s-video out port like my old laptop did. I didn't realize when i ordered the product that it was 'vga to component video' and not 'vga to rca cable'. i tried my hardest to get it to work when i received it in the mail, but all of my efforts were in vain because my tv does not have a component video in, only rca (red, white, yellow) and an s-video in port. pretty frustrating. i'm hopefully going to be able to exchange it with the vendor, eForCity.com or whatever. i read a couple of positive reviews about the vendor doing exchanges for wrong products."
4,Loved the book and the movie,"I adored the book and gave it to all my friends and relatives at Christmas. McMurty is a gifted writer who really does understand women. He is a master of the subtle power struggles that go on between mothers and daughters. In spite of the sad ending, I laughed out loud through most of this novel. The author is a great entertainer with a marvelous ironic wit and the ability to create larger-than-life characters who stay in our imagination. In the end I found the book intriguing and touching. The movie is terrific, but utterly different, leaving out so many of the quirky characters and stories in the book that it is almost a different animal. The book and the movie should each be taken on its own merits."
3,pretend you never saw the movie and...,"This book is really good. I love the movie; I have seen it a million times. I thought I would get the book and see what I had been missing all these years. When I read the first chapter, I have to admit, I was disappointed. I could see the book is ENTIRELY different. So I just pretended that the movie wasn't based on the book, and I laughed my way to the end of the story. I suppose the question I have now is, what in the world were ""they"" thinking when they changed the story so much for the film? It is great just as it is."
2,Why did the box come with a dice?,"I was playing this with my family and when the first dasher went, he didn't roll the dice to determine the category and instead simply chose his own category. I protested (since obviously this provides an unfair advantage for the dasher). My protesting escalated but when I challenged my brother, I read the rules and was humbled. Apparently the dasher IS free to pick his own category. What nonsense!!! How do the publishers justify this? Not only was I humiliated in front of my entire family, but I became so frazzled that I ended up losing the game."
5,Great Fun & Creative Entertainment w/ a Dash of Education,"My family and I enjoy playing this game very much. Expanding on the original concept of Balderdash (where players create phony dictionary definitions of obscure words and try to pick the correct one), this game adds new categories like dates, people, initials, and movie plots. The variety helps make the game even more fun, and keeps it from getting stale.One of my favorite things about this game is that it continually surprises us how good our made-up answers are! You would think that you could guess pretty easily which answers were true and which were false, but it's not always that easy. We're not all creative geniuses either. We run the gamut from a college professor, to a high school student, to a nine-year child. Just about anyone can play this game and have a great time. (My only complaint is that you run out of answer slips too fast; you can just use plain paper, though.)"
3,I wish I'd resisted,Normally I'm a huge fan of Mark Joyner but I didn't get full value from this book. I found the concepts were bang on and the information was clear but there wasn't anything I hadn't heard before. Now I have to admit that I am a prolific reader and it probably isn't fair to expect something new on such a widely written topic. And it could have been just poor timing on my part as the information didn't match up with where my business is right now. Like I said earlier I'm a fan of Mark's and read his advice in his daily ezine constantly and will probably buy his next book too.
5,The Best Bead Book in the World,"This book is my favorite out of all craft books. It has easy-to-follow instructions, clear illustrations for every step, and all the beads and wire you need to make all 19 creatures including insects, people and some animals (such as skunks). I liked it so much I bought it with my own money, but it is a great gift for kids aged 9-12."
2,A Bit Off,"This magazine is usually amongst my favorties, however the first issue I received seems to be very bland and generic. Hopefully the next will be better."
4,A magazine I enjoy reading every month.,This is a wonderful magazine. I enjoy reading it every month. It has a variety of articles and a few are sure to fit your life. You can get it for $5.99 on Redbook website.
5,Great!,I am very happy with my purchase! I received a 2 yr. subscription to Redbook for $5.00!!!! Where else can you find a great deal like that?!?Thank you so much Amazon!!!
5,Excellent Value! Filled with useable info.,"I really like this magazine, even if its a woman's magazine. Often I find these types of magazines filled with advertisements and articles that never seem to fit a real persons every day life. This magazine features a nice cross section of information on fashion, decorating, cooking, and relationships. I always find something interesting to read in here."
4,redbook magazine review,I receive daily e-mails from frugalgirls.com and it was through this website that I heard about the link for the magazine subscription for just 3.99 a year. I've always enjoyed this magazine but have stopped purchasing a lot of what I like due to the economy. It's a real treat to have it again!
5,All is well!,Received in a timely manner and just what I was expecting! I love Redbook! This was such a great deal also that I decided to treat myself to a few other mags! I work 2 jobs and will enjoy relaxing and winding down when I get some rare free time to read them! Thanks amazon!
1,Laugh Track,"Amelia Bedelia, the world's most foolish maid has made another fine mess. This story seemed strained and forced. The Amelia series are predictable and it is like hearing the same tired joke repeatedly. In this case, the joke wasn't funny in the first place."
4,Funny and Humerous,"Asterix in Britain is another well done Asterix movie. Not nearly as good as Asterix vs. Ceaser, and 12 Tasks of Asterix but good never the less. I strongly recommend this video for family viewing."
3,Facsimile or Not???,"Does anyone know if this publication contains the original pulp artwork? The Publisher has failed to provide this important information, yet again."
4,16th century espionage enticing the 21st century,"Leslie Silbert wrote a compelling novel about espionage in the 16th century and the effects it has in the 21st century.Kate Morgan, a spy, with the Slade Group, an extention of the CIA, has been given an assignment to help decode an old manuscript for one of the Slade Groups valuable clients. No one knows what is in this manuscript but Kate's passion for Elizabethan espionage has her brain dancing.Silbert weaves the story from 2 different time periods, showing how the actions of Christopher ""Kit"" Marlowe, playwright and spy, have shaped the reactions of the villians in the 21st century. The chapters switch between Marlowes world and Kate's world, and you are never truly sure who the bad guy is until the end.What kept this from being a 5* book is that one story line seemed to just fall short. Hopefully that particular storyline will continue in her next Kate Morgan story."
5,"Wow, fun thriller!",Entertaining and educational. Enjoyed learning about Marlowe and Elizabethan England in a suspenseful manner. Really liked the intertwining of parallel espionage tales separated by 400 years. Loved it. Very highly recommended.
2,"a clever idea, but poorly done","I bought this book to read on trains, planes, and busses while traveling in Italy. I was tremendously disapointed by it. I was surprised that it lasted me two overseas flights, two overnight train rides, and several bus rides, not to metion several days at the beach, yes, it was just that annoying. It is a clearly autobiographical story and would have been more credible if written as such. Further, what could have been an interesting plot gets lost in middle-school like tangeants about how very cool the main character is, a serious case of tell don't show, peppered with a little self-inflation. While Silbert is no doubt intelligent, her book is worked out around her desire for the reader to adore and admire her main character rather than around an intricate parallel murder story."
2,Great Idea Surrounded by Muck,"Take one great idea (Marlowe) and mix it up with tired, formula thriller elements and you get this book. The writing is pedestrian, the characters stock and the pacing uneven. Nice cover, though."
3,"It's BOOK #5! If you read it out of order, too bad!","Many years after Dion has recovered from the death of her younger son (and almost her own death for the 500th time!), her granddaughter by her remaining birth son undertakes her own adventure.It was very difficult to bring this later world into alignment with the one we got used to in the first books. It spends a lot of time talking about bio-this and bio-that and how everything on the planet is basically ""grown"" and not built. Kind'a hokey.It also has a publication date that is before the fourth book's (Wolf's Bane) publication date. This is too bad. Because, by reading this book before Wolf's Bane, it damaged what would, otherwise, have been a very good story in that 4th book.This book is ok, but it *was* hard to put myself into this new ""future"" when I'd become so used to Dion and Aranur's world."
2,"I'd really rate this a 2 1/2, I was very disappointed","Only 1,000? ok...I was very disappointed after reading this book, the others were sooooooooo much better. But don't dispair! Dion's back in Wolfs Bane and Wolfs Bane is either the best or ties for the best in the series. Grayheart suddenly brought forth about 10 new characters, each more dull than the last...except for the mysterious Coale...I won't say too much more since I don't want to ruin this for everyone. Basically, this book was dry, predictable and was only a fraction of Tara Harper's talent, since it skips into another time, decades later, you don't NEED to read this book to finish the series...since it basically has nothing to do with the others. My advice, skip it."
4,I just Loved it,"It was a great story that holds a exitement at berable levels, after a long day of work. It you want fast pace stories this isn't for you, but if your willing to read past the first three chapters, it will be will worth the wait."
1,Boycotting Us Weekly,"This deceitful, wretched company is a disgrace to journalism. It is nothing more than a pawn of the extreme left political machine.I, for one, am boycotting this company - at least until they publish a front page apology for this shameless attack on Sarah Palin - if not indefinitely."
2,Credibility is very poor!,"Earlier in the year, I bought this magazine based upon the cover stories. Right after I purchased the magazine, the cover stories proved to be FAKE. In addition, they copy much of their material from PEOPLE magazine. I recommend you buy PEOPLE instead of this magazine."
5,Best GUILTY PLEASURE!,"US Weekly is no doubt the best guilty pleasure right now. It's the National Enquirer disguised as a glossy magazine, you can buy it at the supermarket checkout without the shame of picking up a trashy tabloid!For those who are addicted to the endless trials and tribulations of J.Lo & Ben or Ashton & Demi, this is the magazine for you. And this mag is all about the photos!!You can finish each issue in 30 minutes! It's really perfect for the MTV generation who have A.D.D. and are too lazy to read cause most stories are two pages long and there's nothing but pictures anyway!"
3,US Weekly...if u pay the bills on time,"The magazine itself is fine, but I do find that they have a tendency to speculate about celebrites. Also, be very careful of how they bill you. Usually magazine subscriptions mail you about every couple of months. I got two bills in under two weeks when I sent out and they're very quick to send in another. Other than that it's a fun magazine."
5,Awesome Celebrity News,"I'm an avid magazine reader and once I stumbled onto US, I couldn't wait for the next week to get here so I could read the next issue. I think it's a well written and photographed magazine. The quality of the articles are top shelf."
1,NEVER RECEIVED AN ISSUE,"This was a terrible, terrible mistake. I ordered these for a work-related purpose to my office building with several companies on the floor. Despite putting the company name in the address, I have yet to receive a single issue. This order was placed in December. The communication has been sparse and unhelpful."
4,Fabulous magazine,"This is a fabulous magazine, chock full of information about every topic you can think of regarding the city, culture, important issues of today and more."
5,paper and glass,Now that I have the time-just retired !!!-to read what I want to-this is a double treat.I still like some things on paper but to read in bed on a Fire is perfect.
3,Huh..,"As I understood things, the first issue would not arrive until the beginning of January 2013. It was meant to be a birthday present for my wife. Issues are addressed to me not my wife, and the first issue arrived in the beginning of December. The value is great. Three stars for that. Relatively disappointed by everything else."
3,Come on,"Big breasts for sure, but Lindbergh is NOT center stage in this vintage 70s schlock. However, it has enough cheese to be ""so bad it's good"" and ultimately is best enjoyed in the company of friends."
5,Phenomenal,"What an amazing book. Incredibly complex and massive information is broken down into easy to understand charts, graphs, and picutres.This book is really about two things - one is understanding various aspects of the United States from politics to demographics to education. The second, is how charts can be designed in creative ways to communicate information. I've used several of the concepts myself at work.Great book."
1,Understanding? Understanding? Oh please.,"A great topic, credible contributors, plus an eye-popping cover all led me to believe this was a ""must have"". After an hour of UNDERSTANDING I realized this was a hoax.UNDERSTANDING fails as a design reference and data resource both: some designs are more complex than the data they're communicating; layouts and print quality are often so poor they render the information unreadable; errors of all kinds riddle the pages, from typos to missing digits to transposed characters to uncited sources.You'd think a bunch of people (who are) invested in design would be sticklers for clarity, accuracy and quality; UNDERSTANDING proves otherwise.If you agree that good design facilitates understanding, look elsewhere. Edward Tufte, Nigel Holmes, Alan MacEachren and Robert Harris come to mind..."
4,Second edition is great,"This tutorial is well laid out and thorough. It looks suitable for learning Swing (I'm already fairly proficient) except for beginners to GUIs. It's also well organized as a reference work. It's much easier to understand than ""Java Swing"" from O'Reilly.Of course the ""down side"" is that all the material is available online for free. So as an individual you can judge -- if the free online version is suitable for you then go for it. If you want something for your bookshelf or something you can write on and add bookmarks, well then shell out the money for the book. A CD in the back contains all the examples, so you won't need to go online for anything.Ironically, unlike some earlier reviews (of the first edition) I feel the book is now better organized than the website."
5,I Second Thomas Duff's Review,"The JFC Swing Tutorial Second Edition is among the very best how-to-do it programming books I've read---and I've read scores! For this reason, I felt compelled to write a review of the book, admiring its organization, applauding its authors and encouraging progammers who need to to write Java GUIs to hurry up and by it. But then I read Thomas Duff's review; I became redundant. My recommendation is to read Mr. Duff's excellent review---knowing that I agree with every word of it."
2,annoying repetative album,"Red Flags Codebreaker T133 seems very monotonous me. I happen to own most all their albums and admire their atempts to try different things over the years, yet i find this album annoying. I suppose it's comparable to the early NIN sounds, but the gritty industrial sound over and over made every track feel the same. This album could be good for some late night fast driving, but i would much prefer the De Vision remix album or any Mesh album for that matter."
3,editing,"first, alex datcher and liz hurley make the movie worth watching. notice the aircraft call letters are backwards as if flies across the screen? or how about when the terrorist shoot the guy and throw him out of the plane on the airfield? if you look closely at the under side of the passenger plane, which is silver, you can see the guy land on a blue air mattress. such realism. that, and a carnival ground? pa-leezzz! ahh, but liz and alex"
3,Dumb fun,"Passenger 57 dates back to the days when Tom Sizemore still had hair, a chin and a career outside homemade porn and when all you needed to get an action movie made was to bill it as Die Hard on a plane/train/bus/ice rink/ostrich farm. Wesley Snipes is the ex-cop on the wrong plane at the wrong time and you'll have no trouble spotting the baddies because, as with all 90s films, they're Brits (in this case Julian Sands wannabe Bruce Payne and Elizabeth Hurley). At a lean 83 minutes it doesn't outstay its welcome and while no classic, as dumb fun action movies go, it's pretty dumb good."
3,John Raines is not insane...,"Wesley Snipes in the guise of a smart as tacks airline security agent? And he just happens to be on the same plane as a sicko terrorist jerk in transport to prison? Heh, sure, why not. Up to that point Hollywood had tried just about every other viable and non viable plot device known to action movies. Truth is, implausibly stupid as it is at times, Passenger 57 does deliver on some pretty lofty thrills. There are lots of cunning and tricky twists thanks to Snipes trying to outwit the baddies. And the baddies themselves, well lets just say they all pale in comparison to their leader, a man who could give fantasy superspy James Bond a serious run for his money let alone Snipes' all too humanly real airline agent. Bottom line: Passenger 57 is a bit hokey at times, yes, but a far better movie than most in this overpopulated genre. 3.25 stars"
5,Twinings English Breakfast Tea-loose,I probably drink 5-6 cups of this tea every day of the year. Twinings is my favorite tea and English Breakfast is but one of the many teas they blend that I enjoy. I never want to be without a cup of their delicious tea.
5,Expensive but worth it,"I had previously drunk this tea but I tried to save money buying some Brand X teas, available from companies less well known, and they did not taste so good as the Twinings ... I endured the cheaper tea for a while but I recently got back to buying the Twining brand and it never tasted so wonderful as to get the good stuff. Now I realize you get what you pay for and the difference is amazing. There is alot of quality variation in tea I dont know enough to know why. People who dont like tea probably drank the bad stuff once and never knew it could be this good."
4,"When the Going Gets Rough, the ""Tough"" Go RUNNING!","Regardless of the accuracy of this film in portraying actual events, the film is an interesting viewing experience. The portrayed view of these entities, whether interpreted as ""alien"", i.e. extraterrestrial, or terrestrial inter-dimensional beings, i.e. rebellious angels (""Nordics"") with some of their works (""Greys""), is probably more accurate than the goofy, spindly creatures portrayed in CE of the 3rd Kind. Largely, these entities don't exhibit characteristics of benign beings as the late Dr. Karla Turner and others have indicated. * ""Night Skies"" is another terrifying film in this genre. ""Fire in the Sky"" is a well-acted film portraying a horrifying experience. No sane person should desire such an encounter.* Kidnapping (""abduction"") is NOT a benign act"
5,Excellent Movie!!,"All I can say is this is one of the best abduction movies I've ever seen. It's truly outstanding. I have seen many alien abduction movies, but this one is the best, it jumps right into the movie from the start. The characters in the movie are excellent! Everything is layed out well.If you are into Sci-Fi movies, your collection is incomplete without this item."
5,Such a GReat MOvie,"And a Great Story. I am from Arizona, where this story takes place. The movie is a little exagerrated when it comes to the Alien scenes, but nonetheless it is a great story about an area in the USA livid with UFO sitings. Highly recommeneded!"
3,Handsome book; not too deep,"For someone who is simply interested in seeing full color photos of stencil graffiti then Manco's book would be a great purchase. Manco profiles key artist from around the world as well as touching lightly on stencil and graffiti history (Information which is readily available else where both online and in print.) As an aside, the book does speak briefly on the philosophy of graffiti in the urban landscape.Sadly the book is little more than a nice looking coffee table book. Artist looking for a guidebook or text that speaks more about the technical aspects of stencil graffiti should look elsewhere. As it is the book is an interesting (though not too informative) slide show of street art.Still, it's a good purchase for fans of the art form or those who are interested in street pop art."
5,Great magazine!,"I gave this magazine to a friend as a gift...She already was subscribing to some of the other magazine about running, but still found this one particularly interesting - full of useful info and training tips..."
1,Heater,We didn't even use it.It turned out to be a replacement for a heater.The discription did not say that.We had to return it at out our cost(over double the original shipping price) I am still waiting to hear from the company if we will be stuck for a restocking charge.Bad all the way around
3,theire ok,"theae cables would be great if they had a silent plug.But they do not last long at all, I didn't get them that long ago, and there already dead got em maybe like a year ago, I've had other cables last much longer then these thing's"
5,Stepping on the Cracks is an AWESOME book!,I love the book Stepping on the Cracks. It is a spectacular book. It is about Elizabeth and Margret and how they come to find out that Gordy is hiding his brother Stuart in the woods away from the army.Also when Margret's brother dies in the war every thing goes wrong except for Stuart asks Barbra to mary him.This a good book for boys and girls ages 9 to 12.
3,"This is NOT ""The Forgotten Soldier.""","In fact it's nothing like the Guy Sajer book.OK it takes place in the Soviet Union and the protagonist is in the Whermacht, end of similarity.It's not a bad movie, it's actually rather courageous considering when it was made, and it does have a lot of authentic equipment, which is rare.Ultimately I'm glad I bought it and I'll watch it again, but, and let me repeat myself, it has nothing to do with TFS."
4,A classic of War films,"I saw this movie only on TV. This is a very realistic war movie and almost rivals the famous ""Platoon"".The historical accuracy (equipment of the soldiers and the arms etc.) is quite good and far surpasses that of the average US-made films such as ""Battle of the Bulge"".The story is rather unusual, in this sense it resembles ""Apocalipse now"". The story of ""Platoon"" is better than ""Cross of Iron"". The reason of the reality of ""Platoon"" comes from the fact that the Director Oliver STONE actually participated the Vietnam War.All in all, this is a classic of the realistic WWII land warfare. Viewers can feel the Antiwar feeling in the film."
3,Good Film - Poor Mastering,"All the qualities of this extraordinary story about brave men risking their lives to the glory of their coward leaders on the battlefield should be sufficient for a buying decision by anyone who likes war movies, specially for those who saw both ""Stalingrad"" and ""Paths of Glory"". The problem is that the picture quality of this DVD is horrible. Full of noise and artifacts, this film is a long way behind the traditional features like crisp images, deleted scenes and superb sound we are used to see on DVD versions. The lack of closed caption is also unforgivable. If you liked this film before and want to complete your ""Best War Movies's list"" you should order this title but if you still have your VHS copy, keep it ! You wouldn't note the difference."
5,Cross of Iron,Great Movie - Was missing a few lines from the original movie but still an excellent movie for its time.
5,Compelling...WW2 from a different perspective.,"I recall seeing this movie on TV when I was much younger, and aside from the excellent battle scenes - which were, until I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" the best battle scenes I had ever seen, the movie is a very moving experience.James Mason and James Coburn play their roles as German soldiers who know the war is lost for them, but who continue to do their duty to the end. Maximillian Schell's inept, glory-hunting captain is a little too Hollywood, however. By and large, German veterans had mostly good things to say about the officers who commanded them.What I thought was one of the more compelling parts of the movie was the beginning sequence. While an innocent-sounding child's song plays in the background, the scenes alternately show Hitler being fawned upon by the happy, prosperous people of the German nation, and the sufferings of young German soldiers on the Eastern Front."
2,Looks like a bad reenactment,"The movie ""Cross of Iron"" is based on the novel by Willi Heinrich. Heinrich's novel is a very well written account of warfare on the eastern front from the perspective of a German non-com. Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" is unfortunately, is a low budget western with homo-erotic undertones. The ""German"" characters look like participants at a bad reenactment. Hell's Angels look more like real German Soldiers than the characters in this film.The dialogue in the film makes me wonder whether Peckinpah was drunk while he was directing this film as the acting and dialogue is overly melodramatic and ludicous.The creditable acting of Coburn, Schell and Mason are not enough to salvage this dreadful film."
4,"Product description says closed caption; however, box does NOT have the ""CC"" and on 2 different DVD players I can't get CC !","I have two different versions of ""Cross of Iron"". I think it is an excellent war movie with great actors; however, the Amazon.com product description SAYS it has closed captioning which is the reason I purchased the newer, longer version. I cannot get CC to work on either of two DVD players one of which is a Blu-ray. The box label does NOT have the CC icon which is the reason I purchased a duplicate copy that is wide screen and has a paultey FOUR minutes additional running time."
4,Bloody masterpiece!,"This is one of the greatest war movies i've ever watched. I can't say I enjoyed it more then Peckinpah's other brilliant movies Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch, however it literally leaves you out of breath by the end.Firstly i'd like to concerntrate on the fight scenes. Although not as good as in other war films such as Hamburger Hill and Full Metal Jacket, they are pleasing to the eye, Peckinpah again using his unique style of slow motion whenever someone os killed, shot or even blow up. Gory as the gun shot wounds may be, it proved much less controversial as many of his other flicks, even though it contains a gruesome scene in which a woman bites of a soliders genitals, which you don't see in full, but leaves much to the imagination.The story is good and strong, it hangs a bit limp on some occasions however by the end gets much much better."
3,Give in to temptation..,"Within Temptation is one of my favorite bands and I was looking forward to this release.The concert and the production is lavish,no arguing there.Their songs,the orchestra and choir are magnificent.But the live sound of everything put together gets to be a bit too bombastic and the lead singer,Sharon doesn't have the strong professional voice to make herself really heard.And by the end of the concert,you can notice that she's really forcing her voice.I think this kind of production would be 10 times better if it was with a singer like Tarja Turunen.Technical details,the sound quality is great and the venue is spectacular.I would recommend this to WT fans,but not for the people who are looking for a real symphonic metal experience.For that,I'd say that Nightwish - End of an Era is so much better than this one."
2,Short and weak rehash of Jimmy's earlier work,"This CD contains only four tracks, re-recordings of some of his earlier work. The new versions are longer than the originals, and have more complex arrangements, but they are a bit too smooth and mellow to be engaging. Further, the sound quality is dissapointing. There is very noticable hiss, and the treble sounds distored. It is rare indeed to hear a modern musical recording that sounds so poor."
1,Wired Review,I do not like this magazine. I only agreed to the subscription because it was free. I would like to STOP its delivery. DO NOT CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD.
5,Want to be a fortune teller?,This magazine is the best way to learn of new technology that will change the way computers and advanced machine will be operating in the near future. 3D printers are the future. It where we are going in the near future. Can you imagine a printer that is building parts for the latest Airbus airplanes. The military is print parts that would cost many time what contractors would bid. Where did I find this out? Wired.
2,"Sadly, its time has passed.","I used to love Wired, and read every issue cover-to-cover. Unfortunately, it's now just a shadow of its former self. Since being sold to Conde Nast publications (or even before?), Wired has been stripped of its meat and transformed into even more of an ad-laden pseudo-catalog than it once was. The irony of the title has become even more obvious as online forums and publications have matured while Wired's writing has lost its urgency and its ad/content ratio has degraded. Unless you're looking for a catalog of geek toys to flip through, your money is better spent elsewhere."
5,addicted since 1994,long time favorite! Just love to stack them every year! I always read wired more than once for sure! And the covers are the best! I'm proud to say I've subscribed for soooo long! Find out first with Wired!
3,Wired Magazine,"I tried this magazine for six months. It has good content, but is not of my desired reading.material."
1,Not Worth It,"I was very disappointed with this magazine. The tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them. Most articles are rather pretentious and boring. In the 5 issues I have received so far only the May 2006 issue had any thing interesting. And it only had two articles which were worth it. The first was ""Robbed Blind"" which was about RFID chips and the second article was ""DIY ways to go green""."
2,Never Ordered,"Dear Amazon,While I did purchase the Flip Ultra HD VideoCam, I never purchased the subscription to ""WIRED"". If you charged my card, please tell me how much you charged. Was the magazine a ""FREEBIE"" along with the Flip Video Cam? Please respond ASAP. Thank you...Pamela T. H."
2,Very uninteresting!!!!,"I bought this for my 70 yr. old mother who is quite well-read and enjoys different and unusual news stories, books, etc.. Anything interesting and off the wall, she likes. This magazine bored her and when I read them myself I found none of the stories were worth my time. It is boring and without substance. I would not recommend this magazine. It is far from being unusual and is rather plain stupid.."
4,Great Magazine,"This magazine is a great read - even if you're not a ""techie"".It gives you an insight into ideas most people don't see on a day-to-day basis.I would recommend this purchase."
3,Free is good,"A free one year subscription without automatic renewal is good.Free through Amazon after buying a printer.This magazine has good editorial content, but seems too full of ads.Also don't like all the ""Blown-in"" subscription cards.With demise of BYTE, this magazine fills a similar niche.I've typically only bought it on news stands to read in a plane.Finally started 6 weeks later. Got January issue, then 3 days laterthe February issue. I called 800-So-Wired to complain, and they claim to extend mysubscription by 1 issue."
4,How to be a nerd when you are not one?,"The ""Wired"" magazine is the cheap and easy way to be a nerd without really being one. It is a techie magazine for everyone (including techies). It features happening people and happening things in the technology world. It also writes it in a way that is cool and hip. And for purveyors of unique print matter, this stands out for its production quality. Its glitzy yet understated if you know what I mean.Content is not just about gadgets but all things technology. For purveyors of pure science, PopSci magazine is better. But for vignettes like approach to happening things, Wired works really well.And for $10, you cant really complain."
5,"The most entertaining technology magazine, EVER!","Wired magazine is a bargain at any price, but $10 a year is ridiculously cheap. This magazine always has some interesting articles on up and coming technology as well as historical looks at former top technologies. One of my favorite regular pieces is the one where they describe the ingredients of common products for consumption or external use. After reading about the ingredients of Red Bull, I will never drink that stuff again.Wired is a keeper, I've never been disappointed."
5,Amazing Magazine!,"This magazine is by far the most versitile one on the market. From computers, to murder mysteries, to plastic surgery, to the Muppets, there isn't a topic this magazine won't touch. Always a good read. Absolutely recommend this magazine for any reader."
2,Haven't gotten it yet,This is a great magizine. But I ordered it on 12/11/2012 and my first issue has not arrived yet. I would hope that it will arrive at my address by the end of the month.Other then all that. The price I snagged it at in the deal of day was great :)
1,Wired???,"I found this magazine to be mostly ads, and the articles were not at all what I expected. Seems more like opinions then researched articles. I guess I missed the true point of this magazine, not at all what I expected. I'm 50 and not really a geek, just love techno stuff, but didn't find this very helpful to me. I have never cancelled a subscription to a magazine before this, but in this case I had to."
1,Not really that good,"Maybe I'm way too geeky for Wired. I find the content neither serious enough to be taken seriously, nor hip enough so I can impress women on the subway reading it. Most of the articles are actually quite annoying because they pretend to be a bunch of druggie geeks. I was enticed by the Amazon gift certicate offer but regret my purchase totally."
3,Took a long time to start up,"I get my magazines finally after waiting 2 months for it to start! They arrive bie USPS beautifully packaged, unfortunately I have not had a chance to read them. So as good as they look, I guess I just didn't want the magazine in the first place. I give it a three because of how long it took to start."
4,Cool!,"This is a great magazine for all network junkies, and ones that are also directed towards the mainstream crowd of consumer electronics and video games. This is NOT a hardware magazine, so be warned: If you want a hardware magazine, get Maximum PC. If you want the best of networking and consumer electronics, there is not much better than Wired."
4,DRAMATIC TALE,A DRAMATIC AND MOVING STORY OF A YOUNG IDEALISTIC POLICE CADET FACED WITH CORRUPTION AND MURDER WHO MUST QUESTION HIS VALUES TO SURVIVE
1,TOO unbelivable to watch! Days of Blunder!,"I've been a nascar fan for around 15 years, and this movie is too unbelivable. It don't help that I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but if you want to watch fantasy, rent Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, or just watch somthing else period. Avoid! Avoid!"
3,Top Gun Part 2?,"Worth seeing, but if you saw Top Gun then you have pretty much already seen Days of Thunder. Cruise hot dogs in his stock car, has a female doctor friend, competes against a jerk, and, after a crash, has trouble ""getting back in the saddle"". Sound familiar?"
3,OK,Not into race car driving. I watch it because I am a Tom Cruise fan. This is not one of his great performance.
2,Days of blunder,"Watchable, but barely. Contrived inner torment. Baseless romance stolen from Top Gun. Not a believable premise. Don't waste ur time."
4,OK,a bit melodramatic but enjoyable like viewing - Tom Cruise was played up a bit too much but for light viewing it is OK
2,Worse then VHS,"I know this movie is crap, but I've always liked it for the funny quotes and how it's so over the top. Any way I give it 1 star because the quality is CRAP.It looks like 4:3 w/ bars on top. CRAP I tell ya. The sound is okay, not much better though. What master did they copy this from? It looks like they ripped a VHS onto their PC and burned a DVD out of it."
4,Excellent coverage of the essentials,"Great little book which I, as a Quality Engineer, found useful and which I would be happy to distribute to busy people at all levels of a company knowing there is a good chance it will be read.This books covers the essentials required to get people started and productive on an FMEA team.Only complaint is the cost to get it down here in Australia!"
2,In no way special. Go to Walgreens.,"Perhaps it's just my hair type. Totally possible. I bought a $15 straightener at a drug store and prefer it over this one. My hair is still super frizzy when I use it, and it pulled my hair. I'm no new iron user, so I'm not retarded. It's supposed to work a certain way and it didn't. Maybe I just got a defective product, who knows. I'm optimistic. But unfortunately I'll never buy anything from HairArt again."
5,Destroy All Humans,5 star rating here. This game is so cool. You get to blast humans and do all sorts of crazy things. I would recommend this to may family and friends.
2,Excavation'- definitely NOT Rolins best work,"I think James Rollins is a great adventure/history/science/archaeology type author. Unique in the blend and very fun and interesting to read. I arrived on the James Rollin scene a bit later, however, having read the Sigma Force books first, then 'Ice Hunt'. I expected the same quality in all his works. 'Excavation', however, just does not cut the Rollins mustard. It has a fairly interesting story- not as imaginative as most of his works- but, well, to be honest, it reads like it was written by the graduate students in the novel. Never was edited by the thesis advisor, however. I think I'll skip 'Subterranean' and just wait for ' The Doomsday Key '."
2,A little... simple,"This read more like a first book from an author. The story just seemed a little forced at times, and the dialog was a little silly. I didn't really end up caring much about the characters despite the authors obvious efforts to get me too. The fact that it was so obvious should tell you something. I did read the whole thing and it was ok. Fairly predictable, but still interesting. Somewhat of a Clive Cussler story, without the interesting characters. If I wasn't on a plane I'm not sure if I would of finished it or not. Sorry, it just didn't grab me."
2,You've got to be kidding,"Obviously mine is not the popular opinion, but I found Excavation to be terribly disappointing. Granted, I have not read Subterranean, so maybe I was assuming too much of Rollins as an author. Still, from the Irish character whose brogue comes and goes (and never actually convincingly), to the ridiculous conclusion, I have to say that I felt I had wasted my time. My apologies to his fans...obviously I'm in the minority. As fascinating as the peripheral images of the book were, and even at times the plot itself, I felt overall it was pretty disappointing. It gets one star for having an interesting title, and one star for the character Denal. I did like him."
1,Bury It!,"Merciful Zeus! Let no innocent excavate Excavation! Bury the path to its covers for eternity with flaming lava spouted from Mount Olympus! Cast this book into the deepest fathoms beneath the mighty Kraken's lair! Seal it forever in grim Hades' darkest vault! Or mercifully blind the good populace of Athens like King Oedipus, that their eyes may never accidentally transgress all that is holy and fall upon these pages, ever after to be haunted by the foul Furies that plague the House of Agamemnon!Or at least warn them, Zeus, warn them that this book is a nine-year-old's crayon novelization of the Richard Chamberlain movie version of King Solomon's Mines!Please, Zeus, please! I beg you, on my knees!Never mind, Zeus. I'll do it for you.Seriously, this book is so badly researched and inconsistent, it makes Marvel comic books read like Classics Illustrated. Even a lower-I.Q. junior high school student wouldn't believe any of it. Save your money."
3,Liked Subterranean Better.,James Rollins tells a good tale in this book. This is an interesting spin on an extinct tribe and the mystery surrounding the culture. I liked this book but not as much as others by him. Worth reading if you like surprises and adventure.
4,Good book,Entertaining and exciting. It captivated my imagination. I am a Rollins fan and can't seem to put his books down. This wan didn't disappoint.
2,Haven't I Read All This Before Somewhere?,"Reading James Rollins gives one a tremendous experience of deja vu. These adventures seem to be cobbled together from everything and everywhere in a hit or miss way that keeps the reader asking himself if he's read this before. Well, he has. Probably in childhood adventure stories and all the modern thriller writers. Only it's all been done better and it's all been done to death. While this ""writer"" may have a following, I prefer not to read light thrillers that should have footnotes giving credit to other source material. Maybe something original would be nice. All authors build on the work of others but they all don't borrow as blatantly and produce epics like these in a by-the-numbers method on an assembly line."
2,"This is a reprint of an older book, NOT A NEW BOOK","Even though this just came out in hardback, it was originally published in 2000. It's early Rollins and not all that good, with some very creepy parts. I mostly wanted to alert readers that this is not new, since one would naturally ASSUME that a new hardback is a new title.Personally, I find it poor business practice to try to cheat the readers with this type of tactic. While it does say on the copyright page that it was originally copyrighted in 2000, everything else about it is as if it's a new title. Save your money, pick it up as a used paperback, it's not worth more than that."
3,Where was the editor?.,"I enjoy Mr Rollings books. This one was a little predictable, but still good. What got to my nerves was the Spanish quotes, where was the editor?. Throughout the whole book we see written ""El Sangre del Diablo"", Sangre in Spanish is femenine, so the right way would be ""La Sangre del Diablo"", ""Entrada"" doesn't mean ""Came on In"", it refers to an entry, a door or something and finally I can't figure out what ""Que Hiscistes"" mean and I'm Spanish!.How hard can it be to loan the manuscript to somebody with command of the languaje to correct mistakes?.Appart from that, this is an entertaining work of fiction."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book with great expectations. I feel the stilted conversations, and completely unbelievable situations, with little regard for history combine to make this book unreadable. I've quit at page 292, unable to endure the torture for another page."
3,okay to read,okay read to add to the collection although it was kinda slow paced at times -- kinda rushed at the end seemed like the author was useing a cook book approach to the story line
4,Another good Rollins read...,"This was my second James Rollins book, after starting with Subterranean, which I found to be outstanding for a first novel. Excavation stands in that same vein-lots of adventure, a decent story line, some definite plot twists, and a quick ending that ties up most of the loose ends. I'd rank this one just a slight notch below Subterranean, but still more than highly enough to continue reading all of Rollins' more recent works.If you haven't yet read anything by Rollins, now is the time to start!"
4,"Good read, solid characters and plot","I enjoyed this book - it had solid characters and it was nice to revisit people from prior books. This book was superior to The Cabin, in my opinion, and thank goodness she cut down on the ""texas ranger"" phrase. Perhaps I'm missing something, but Neggers seems obsessed with overusing phrases in her writing, and if there is one downfall in this book, that would be it.. using one phrase over and over again. Tess was a strong female character, and Sam was a good match for her, and the murder plot was interesting too, although some parts (like the kids running amuck) were hard to believe. Overall, an improvement from The Cabin."
3,skeletons in the closet,"When I first started this book, I kind of loved it. The beginning was interesting and made me want to dive right in and get some reading done. Things were going along okay until the discovery in the basement. After no one decided to call the cops my this-is-ridiculous meter went into the red zone and the rest of the events in the book just compounded the silliness. I really like this author, I just really don't love this book."
3,Straps...,"We bought this car seat because it is supposedly the safest of economy-line car seats. The straps often get twisted and fold into the buckle part, but this is expected for a cheaper model. However, what has happened with ours is that one of the straps has been getting caught on a tab underneath when trying to adjust them (the tab is supposed to guide the straps and keep them from moving about underneath when adjusting), and has puckered the straps, almost putting a couple holes through. Since I'm sure this is compromising the safety, we are now going to get a different car seat (the well known but more pricey Britax, most likely). (Update: We were able to purchase new straps for a few bucks from Cosco (they would have replaced them if still under warranty) and occasionally use the seat as a spare - the new Britax is naturally easier to use, but also huge!)"
2,Not Worth The Price of a Subscription,"As an aficionado of all things historic, old, and traditional, I subscribed to ""The Saturday Evening Post."" I was disappointed by what I received. With the exception of the excellent illustrations by Norman Rockwell, the magazine was largely advertisements for prescription medications and puff pieces about popular actors, authors, and other celebrities. This is not a worthy heir to the legacy of its founder, Benjamin Franklin, and the many gifted and talented individuals who have been associated with the magazine throughout its history. Simply put, it was not worth the price of a subscription."
3,Either Way,"I was expecting it to be larger. My son gets bored very easily with it. Probably wouldn't purchase again, especially for the price."
5,Excellent Service,This is one of 4 DVD orders I placed through Amazon recently. All arrived on or earlier than the specified time and in perfect condition. Very pleased with the service as none of the DVDs ordered are available in Australia. They all play perfectly on my equipment.
4,Good Information,This provides you with a solid base to further explore the topic and goes well with the Slapping Technique volume. Well worth the money...
4,Pleasant score reminiscent of '40s weepers,"Although the film itself was somewhat of a mess, the Vlad/Arnaldi score is quite lovely and atmospheric. Congrats to DRG for carrying this and other not-so-mainstream scores and for not being tempted to include Cher's a cappella snippet just for commercial value."
5,My fav group.,I really like this group.They are like my #1 hit. It was nice to hear thier music when they came up to Russellville for The Flying Fish Festival. They started playing and right in the middle of like their 3rd song it started raining.I prayed for it to go away but it did not until the girls left. I still wish they would come and sing at my church....
5,Barbie movies are really nice,"The computer animation is really good, as well as the story itself along with the original music. Great family movie."
3,ok for kids who like mermaids,"Kudos that the hero is a girl. Barbie as ""Merliah"" is at first angry when she finds out she is part mermaid. After visiting the mermaid world she decides to fight for it. Eris, the villian, is a bit flat of a character. In defeating Eris, Barbie is reunited with Mom, Queen Callisa. Some cute underwater jokes and good scenery. Not the best Barbie movie though. If your kids like mermaids, it's good. If you are just looking for a good Barbie movie, we liked 3 Musketeers, Princess and Pauper, and Swan Lake which had better plots."
5,Great girls movie for the Barbie lover,"My daughter was so excited to get this, she has wanted the first one as she already had Mermaid Tail 2. Great Barbie move"
5,Great Movie...,Like all the other Barbie Movies my little sister loves it. She has all of them. So it was inevitable to get this one.
5,Great buy!,"I bought this movie for my niece; she is five years old. She absolutely loved it! Plus, I purchased it at a great price!"
3,save your money,this movie is $9 at target. so while its the same movie there you can get it for cheaper! my daughter loves the movie though
5,Barbie rocks,A Barbie movie is always a winner in my daughter's eyes. She loves the movie and has already watched it numerous times. My other daughter who is not a Barbie fan enjoyed it also. She wants to learn to surf the waves now.
3,Looks good but has a few issues,I really wanted to love this fan. It looks good but it makes a squeaking noise that we cannot stop. A warning also for assembling...the screws are so tiny that they are really hard to handle.
4,This was a gift,This was a gift...apparently it is a hit. Will be used for french class and a trip to Paris. Very compact and user friendly.
5,Pure and Uncut Honest Funky SOul,"Won't waste too many words but this cd is worth every penny if you're into soul. Yes, he does sound like Stevie a lot on some songs, but luckily he does have his own sound on the whole. If u're into Bilal, D'Angelo, Erykah, Jill, etc. this is definitely for you. Solid."
5,MASTERPIECE,"If you love Stevie Wonder and Donnie Hathaway, then you'll LOVE Donnie! His lyrics move you and make you feel proud of your heritage. He is such a brilliant writer and I hope that he gets recognized for his brilliance."
5,strickly tha bomb!!,"I bought this cd after listening to a few songs while riding in the car with my friend. I instantly feel in love with this cd. My favorite tracks on the album are ""DO U KNOW"", ""CLOUD NINE"", & ""HEAVEN SENT"". This is the best cd that i have heard in a long time. Donnie has a soulful, neo-type of sound going on that you dont get to hear all the time. If you want to listen to something new i recommend this album!"
4,Suitable rack,"Rack works well. Fitted the bike ok, with good clearance for fenders. Only comment is it rattles when unloaded for every little bump, though I think this is a function of it being universal"
4,Some of the creepiest music I've heard in some time,"With a mild shudder and a quick glance over my shoulder, I have to say that Unknown Hinson's ""The Future Is Unknown"" is some of the creepiest music I've heard in some time. Cloaking himself in the persona of a country vampire certainly works for this batch of tunes about such matters as stalking, perversion, lust, drinking, trailer life, and peeping Tom's. Unknown Hinson himself plays all the instruments on this batch of twisted tales, albeit some better than others, but one tends to overlook any deficiencies because his lyrics demand the same careful attention accorded to the mad doctor who tells his helpless victims what is in store before beginning his grim work.I cannot recommend a steady diet of this music, but it does fit well if you are on a weekend escape in a remote cabin or blockhouse, and you can suspend your disbelief long enough to shake your head and grin. But don't let Unknown Hinson give you any ideas. . ."
3,Not as good as I thought it was going to be.,"Saw Unkown Hinson on Bob and Tom, and heard a few songs on Outlaw Country. Most tracks are pretty good, but over all a little dissapointing."
4,Very good game,"This game, Monopoly Millennium, is a very fun game. It is not like any of the other monopolys. This one is by far the best. If you get anything for a child in the double digets, get this."
5,Devil at My Heels,Excellent reading. I read the book in three days. I didn't want to put it down. I especially enjoyed the portion concerning his receiving Christ as his personal savior.
4,Devil at my heels,"A little too much of ""I"". If his book,really dwelling a lot on the spiritual, could have been combined with ""unbroken"" each of them would have been improved, but that's only my take."
5,Excellent Book,"A good book to read along with ""Unbroken"". A book worth reading. This guy is a real hero.I loved it!"
3,Pretty good math book,"It has examples that are clear, but can still leave certain areas unknown. It is difficult for independent study, but is quite good if accompanied by an excellent instructor. It would be best to avoid it if you are trying to teach youself."
5,A good way for me to rethink things,"When I first bought this book, I had planned to emigrate to New Zaland. After I started reading it I decided to go on holiday there first and hitchhike, just like Joe Bennett.However, reading more and more of the book, I decided hitchhiking might not be the best idea for me. So I will take a bus tour.Where the book really proves its worth though is when it comes to describing the country. It portays New Zealand for a great nation, but also one that is desolate and for the most part empty. Sure Auckland might be a big city, and Wellington and Christchurch following suit, but the rest of the country? Sometimes you can taste the loneliness of the land.Having traveled to New Zealand since, I can only say that the loneliness that you can feel while reading the book, is not present at all in the land itself."
3,Intelligent!,"This is a very intelligent novel. Faulkner's style is very different from many other authors. I liked the characters' psychological description, very well done. However, for moments the novel was distracting because it was not easy to follow the story. Anyway, I found it worth reading to know Faulkner's style."
3,Feline Online,"Feline online Have you ever thought that cats would want their fame back? In ancient Egypt, people worshipped cats. If you were worshipped then dropped wouldn't you want your fame back?In this book a smart cat gets into trouble after surfing the net and getting a big surprise. In stead of ordering a parakeet, like planned, the cat orders a parrot. This happens because in his dream he learns how to read from Bastet. She teaches him this because she wants cats to be worshipped again and if a cat can read surly this will happen. Big surprise to this cat's owner when she comes back from New York! The cat wanted a parakeet to play with and chase around. Now, the tables have turned and the parrot is chasing and playing with him. In this good book a cat gets in trouble with a computer. Read this book to find out how he gets out of this mess, or even does."
3,A Tad Above Mediocre,"WFaFS wasn't terribly bad--but it wasn'tterribly good, either. Some parts of it--such as the intertwining of religion and politics--worked well and was enjoyable, but other parts could have used a little more work. If you like pulp fantasy, you'll probably enjoy this book more than I did: the plot and characters follow the general fantasy tropes without breaking new ground."
3,a history or torment and enchantment,"Yes falling in love, it marks one's life whether one realizes it. The book argues that over the last 2,000 years love is still love. It explores all the different ways people experience love.Throughout the book it is concerned as to how people might manage love better.explores gender, sex, why, choosing, cultural ideas, etc... what one feels, trying to define it.I think the book has a basic understanding. Nothing as advanced as some other readings I've come across.easy to skip this one."
5,A sophisticated muscian,"""Americana"" is often associated with music that is light, casual, fun, and (always) enjoyable. Such is the case with Paul Asbell's Steel String Americana, but this guy plays at a different level. The casual Americana fan will love this album, but the serious picker will be truly inspired. (And the same can be said of Asbell's Roots & Branches album)."
5,A very important book for today & tomorrow's leaders,"An absolute must-read for all coaching professionals and for leaders using a coaching style, Silsbee breaks it down to provide the essence of why each role exists and how to utilize each one to fulfill your purpose. Loaded with examples from his extensive experience and with suggestions for both self-reflective and shared practice, The Mindful Coach is in itself a toolkit of wisdom that you can use to develop your own skills as well as those of your clients and/or employees. This is an updated version of the book; my original version (2004) is so worn with tabs, stickies and notes, that it was time for the next generation. In reading the new version I was introduced to more insights, tools and techniques and also was reminded of best practices for personal skill development and application in my own work with clients. I have recommended this book to many people and continue to do so."
4,"Good, Fun Toy","This is a fast paced, fun toy. There are many different things you can try, and it is fun. There are 5 things where you need quick reflexes to bop, spin, twist, pull, or flick. This is fun, but you may not be able to rely on it. My spin it broke soon after I got it. But it is unlikely and it is a lot of fun. I would recomend it if you like this sort of toy."
4,Fun for All,We didn't worry about the the educational value. Don't know how to rate that. My 12 year old daughter and her friends love it. The adults in our home get a kick (and challenge) out of it. Even our 15 yr old son occasionally joins in. Good fun.
5,REPLACE THE KIDS' VIDEO GAMES WITH THIS SIMILAR TOY!,"This ""feels"" just like a video game to play: it involves quick reflexes, quick thinking, and quick hands. It is fun, fun, fun, and EXTREMELY addictive! (You can't play it just once! ) It is durably constructed of plastic, so even younger kids can bash it around and it will pretty much stay intact. Though it doesn't seem very educational, the toy actually does improve reflexes and quick thinking. Highly reccommend it as an educational alternative for the video game addict!"
1,didn't work & discontinued,"We bought this for my daughters friend as a birthday gift. After giving it in the original package, my daughter asked how the Bop It was and discovered it didn't work. Contacting the company directly they found it had been discontinued so was ""traded"" for a different toy."
5,Take it from a music teacher; this is a great game!,"I teach elementary music in grades 1 through 5, and am constantly looking for new ways to introduce musical concepts to the kids. Along came ""Bop It"" and rhythm became something more than black and white notes on a page! The students loved it!Then along comes ""Bop It Extreme"" and it blew me away. ""Extreme is a real test of musical pulse as well as ear to hand coordination. But, beat it all, it is a great time!I have two daughters, 7 and 3, and they both love it. The three year old doesn't get discouraged with losing like the rest of us. She has a great time dancing to the beat!5 very fun stars!!!"
5,You don't need me to tell you that this is an awsome toy!,"I go to a gifted program at school (7th grade) and if we get done with our work early there are cool games that the teacher orders for the other after school classes she teaches. Our favorite was Bopit, until she got Bopit Extreme! We can't put it down, and a lot of teamwork is involved. Just a reminder to you kids out there- if you buy this don't get mad at the people who you are playing with who make you lose! There are many ways to move the controls, and we sometimes cheat by dividing up the work for a one player game so we can get the high score! 5 stars! Two thumbs up!"
2,Disappointing Results of Star Combination,"I thought I would really enjoy the fruits of a collaboration of two of my favorite jazz artists. But the music turns out to be so frenetic and fast that it is bothersome. This might be the ticket for jazz fans that like that style, and surely with these two artists the horn work is superbly done so could be appreciated by discerning jazz aficionados. I like the more deliberate and carefully worked pieces, of which there are many, of these two jazz greats but this CD does not go in the right direction for me."
2,"cool name, terrible movie","i am a huge bond fan. i know every movie. Roger Moore was one of my favorite bonds untill i saw this movie. it is by far, the worst bond movie outthere. i love the opening song by Duran Duran but other than that, the movie stinks. first moore is just way too old. he looks funny in it. second, cheapy probs and sets. the scene in paris when the car falls in half and still drives. pretty stupid also when that french guy runs after it with the worst dubbing in history chanting ""oh, my car, oh my car, oh my car."" and third, the movie just doesn't end! it drags for so long! do not buy this. rent it to see if you like it first.trust me. you can save a few bucks."
4,love James bond movies,"love all James Bond movies, this was one of my last on my list to purchase...love Roger Moore as James...and as always location, story, action, spy-espionage plus a bit romance great for movies.thank you Amazon."
5,A view to a Kill,This completed my collection of all of the James Bond movies. I like all the Bond story lines. The special effects in the movies are just great.
3,Bond Goes Wild,"It's a great film for James Bond fans. Especially if you saw this one when you were a kid. I was only 11 at the time this was released and I loved it. It brings back great memories, but seeing it again as an adult left something missing. I'm not sure what it is but something's not quite there. Oh I enjoyed it but I can't put my finger on what isn't there. Maybe it needs more gun fights. It's hard to tell. The horse race is great and the bad guys are great villains. There aren't as many gadgets as what James Bond usually has plenty of."
1,By far the worst Bond film ever made,"Awful in almost every respect. A low note for Roger Moore's final film of the series. I love these films, but this one is not watchable."
3,Actually 2 1/2 Stars,"A View to a Kill was Roger Moore's last Bond film.It wasn't a bad movie,but it just wasn't up to par with others.(My personal favorite of Moore's was The Spy Who Loved Me,A View to a Kill ranks right behind Moonraker at the bottom)It seemed at times like the actors were just going through the motions.I didn't really care much for Max Zorin as a Bond villain,he just wasn't all that scary.I did,however,like the charactor of May Day.I also liked Tibbet,although he didn't last very long.As for Stacy Sutton,I thought she was very pretty,but not a very good Bond girl.The film had a good musical score by John Barry(It sort of reminded me of On Her Majesty's Secret Service at times),and the title song by DuranDuran was excellent.Overall it was an okay movie,but as a Bond film it probably has to be my least favorite.The DVD is very good with lots of extra features."
1,The Worst Bond Film...EVER!,"This film is such an embarassment to the James Bond series, I can't even bring myself to watch it. First of all, Roger Moore looks OLD as heck in this film! His last film as Bond should have been ""For Your Eyes Only"", which is his best performance as Bond. Tanya Roberts (Stacey) is the most annoying Bond girl of all time and not at all believable as a California's state geologist and a businesswoman. Every time it comes to a fight or some action she cowers and whimpers, yelling `Help me James' at the top of her shrill voice, and spends most of the time as some sort of damsel in distress for Bond to save.The only good thing about this movie is Christopher Walken plays a great villian and its good to see the great Patrick Macnee on screen again. Also, the title song by Duran Duran is awesome too. Other than that, this movie is lame. Watch if you must!"
3,OK I guess,"A View To A Kill was OK but not one of the best. But it's not the worst either. This is the worst Roger Moore one though and it was such a bad idea to make this his last one. I wish Octopussy or For Your Eyes Only was his last or at least made The Living Daylights his last even though Dalton did quite a good job of performing in it. They should have made this after Moonraker. I'm not saying it was as bad, I'm just saying they have some sort of similarity like for instance, they both happened in California. But most of the of the action sequences were enjoyable. I know part of the plot but not all of it. All I know is that one of Zorin's (the villan performed by Christopher Walken) horses got an operation on her leg so the could put the micro chip inside her and the micro chip would make the horse win the race. you can buy this. It's kind of enjoyable, but don't expect too much from it."
1,Bondview,"As Bond films go, this one ranks low although the title song is still catchy even now (Duran Duran). Our Main objection is there is no mention of municipal bonds.... James Bond films have plenty of financial plot devices mostly having to do with paying the villain's ransom or else. But they really should mention other bonds. Bondview is the main source for municipal bond information.Maybe the next bond film will mention it."
1,huh?,this movie looks like on her majesty secret service a whole lotta talkings on it and roger moore final apperance as 007 his finall apperance as 007 is [bad] but theres a whole lotta stunts on it a q made a stupid gadget q made a puppy oh please!this movie stinks on ice.
5,Another Great hit from United Artist.,One of the best James Bond movies ever. Along with Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me comes A View To A kill. A View To A Kill is another sit at the edge of your seat action packed movie. With the fight on top of the Golden Gate bridge is awesome. And the part when Bond had to disarm a big bomb under the ground in a mine is a another awesome scene. Followed by other awesome scenes in A view to A kill
2,OCTOPUSSY should have been Roger Moore's last outing as 007,"I'LL GIVE THIS ONE 2 1/2 STARS. IT'S OK BUT NOT A GREAT BOND FLICK WITH A WIMPY PERF BY BOND GIRL TANYA ROBERTS. CHRIS WALKEN'S ALRIGHT AS A VILLAIN, UNDERPLAYING A BAD GUY ROLE FOR A CHANGE. IT'S JUST...HOW OLD WAS ROGER MOORE HERE, 75 YRS OLD? IS THAT HIM SKIING IN SIBERIA TO THE TUNE OF ""CALIFORNIA GIRLS""? WISH I COULD SAY YES? HIS STUNT DOUBLES ARE VERY VERY NOTICABLE; STUNTS ARE FINE. MOORE AND AN OLDER PATRICK MACNEE DUKING IT OUT WITH BAD GUYS? I HAD TO LAUGH.PASSABLE FARE HERE. LOVE THAT FAKE ICEBERG SUBMARINE IN THE BEGINNING. GREAT BOND TUNE BY DURAN DURAN. THE BEST ONE."
3,"Well, lets see....","It wasnt the best of plots, or even the best scenes. Some were great- others were a bit predictable. The only positive: Duran Duran on the soundtrack. Call me nuts! :)"
3,dull,"No, this is definitely not as good as I remembered from way back when. It's just dull. Okay, some good scenes, but overall it's not a good Bond flick. Get ""For your eyes only"", ""Octopussy"", or ""Live and let die"" instead. They are much better."
4,A VIEW TO A KILL VHS LTBX EDTION,"A MUST SEE IN LETTER BOX VHS OR DVD.BUY THIS VIDEO IT,S WORTH SEEING ROGER MOORE IN HIS FINAL BOND APEARENCE.ENTERTAINING.FUN"
3,If only a few years earlier...,"The problem with A View To A Kill is that Roger Moore wasn't a fast running man anymore. Time passes even for James Bond. The history has its good points, some memorable shoots (firetruck in San Francisco, chasing Grace Jones on Paris and others), but the action is in somewhat slow motion. Not what you would expect from a Bond movie. The DVD is fine, as all the others on this series, with interesting extras. Would've benn much better if Moore were a few year younger."
3,Good practical book.,Worthwhile reading. Good illustrations.Could be more detailed in certain areas.Would recommend.
3,interesting,its good to browse at cause of all the latest styles but thats really it. It's nutn great
5,Great Savings!,"I would not have thought originally about Amazon providing such a great savings on such a popular magazine. I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and with all of the sales I tried to catch for clothing and other things, this was an added bonus of savings by ordering through Amazon. Vogue is a great magazine for the latest fashion!"
1,Poor subscription service,"This is a review of the subscription, not the magazine.I ordered my subscription in late July. On September 6 I received the AUGUST issue even though the September issue was already on the newsstands. And of course they set my subscription end date to July 2012. I just ordered this subscription and I already feel ripped off. I've requested the missing issue and expiration reset, no response yet. If this isn't resolve by the middle of September I'm cancelling the subscription."
1,It doesn't even deserve one star...total trash!!,"Isn't it ironic that a magazine such as US Vogue couldn't be anymore passe if it tried. This has to be the WORST fashion magazine out today. Everything from the covers to the editorials are mediocre at best. If you want a REAL fashion magazine, try Vogue Italia....much better than its ... American counterpart."
3,Christmas Light Tester,"The unit works great on a two wire system, however, on a multi wire system, the unit performed below expectations."
4,Good steamer,"I must use this at least once a week. It steams veggies and rice perfectly! It only misses a five star rating because I wish it was easier to steam several items together, and I can't seem to figure out how to remove the top without dripping water on my counter, but otherwise good product."
5,Surprising Brick,A powerful and original book. Wonderfully rich and beautiful photographs accompany a lucid text.
1,Don't bother,"I haven't read the other works by Annabel Davis-Goff, but after finishing (plowing through) the book, then looking at her picture on the back cover, it explained some things. She looks unhappy and searching, and the book is written in that vein. I kept waiting for clarity on the questions our heroine was searching out, but was left hanging at every paragraph end. All in all a frustrating book."
1,this Cold Country leaves me cold,"I finished this book only because it was assigned by my book club. It reminds me of the books I read in sixth and seventh grade, found in the ""Young Adult"" section of my neighborhood library in the l950's. Everything about the book, both plot and character development, as well as use of language, is thin, without depth or complexity or passion. If one likes simple reading, and this is a novel of simple reading, I would recommend Catherine Cookson. At least, she has great stories told with feeling."
2,Bookworm,"This book started well with Daisy, working as a landgirl, meeting Patrick whom she marries in a short time. After moving to his ancestral home in S. Ireland, she meets his rather odd family and finds out the family are in dire financial straits. There is a murder which is never solved in the book, also can Daisy resurrect her marriage eventually? There are other events never fully explained which left me feeling unsatisfied. I searched to find out if the author had written a sequel which would explain what happened to all the characters, but there is none. The book starts at the beginning of World War 2 in 1940 and ends in 1942 so everything is left hanging in the plot. Not a good ending."
1,Save your money,"I found this book to be more boring as it went along. The characters are thin and undeveloped -- couldn't even get a handle on Daisy and what made her the way she was, or the other characters for that matter. They just seem to appear out of nowhere. The reader is denied any glimpse into the development of Daisy's romance. The prose is thin and boring, the author shows no gift for a turn of phrase. Even a bad plot can be saved by wonderful writing -- this book gave me no investment in anything going on. I only finished it because I blew 20 bucks on it."
2,Texas locations should be advertizing; not other states...,Ads take up most of magazine. This is suppose to be about Texas; not other states advertising thier properties to visit. No upcoming events are in magazine either. Texas Highways is a much better buy and has locations reviewed in Texas plus upcoming events in TX.I'm sorry I wasted my money on this!
3,Interesting Local Reading,"I have somewhat mixed feelings about this magazine, as I can not tell to what type of audience this is truly meant for. The articles are hard hitting, and well written. I can not dispute that. Sometimes I simply don't find them all that interesting. I enjoy the restaurant reviews, its helpful knowing of a few good suggestions when traveling, or even locally. I find the advertising in the magazine to be a bid auspicious as it seems to cater only to those high members of society that are in serious need of spa treatments and an occasional face lift. Maybe its tough finding advertising, but I find that it takes away from articles about our local government and issues.I do feel this is totally worth the subscription price, and you are bound to find 12 dollars of reading in a years time :) This might even be a good gift idea from someone that is no longer in the area."
2,Sad decline,"I was a subscriber for about 5 years. I also read it a lot as a teen when my parents subscribed. But this year I let my subscription lapse without renewal. A few reviewers have criticized the liberal bias. Some of the articles are liberal to be sure, but overall I don't think it's a leftwing rag. I just noticed that the number of articles that interested me declined in number. In my opinion there were only about 4 great articles per year. Most of the others were either 'so-so' or just unreadable. Paul Burka is the only gem left in the Magazine. Even when I disagree with him I enjoy reading his articles. He's a very gifted writer. But he alone wasn't worth keeping the subscription going. From now on I will just peruse TM at the library. Hopefully a new editor will come along in the near future and return the magazine to it's former greatness."
4,"Good, interesting, informative....","I've been reading Texas Monthly for about 6 months now. It always has plenty of interesting articles. In each magazine, I'm surprised by the things I learn about the people and places in Texas. The articles can get pretty lengthy at times (a little too lengthy for my taste) and there are quite a few ads. (But, with the low price of a subscription, I guess that should be expected.) Overall, a good magazine that I will continue to renew."
2,Of the total 348 pages more than 240 were advertisements,"If you're hunting for a mag with tons of ads mixed with typical left wing drivel, call off the dogs. This is it!"
3,"""Lets Go Pretty Boy"" ~ Coming Of Age On And Off The Ice","`Youngblood' is a slickly produced sports (hockey), coming of age film from '86 with a lot of good looking young men to (Rob Lowe, Patrick Swazee and Keanu Reeves) keep the girls watching, fast moving game sequences and the usual on the ice fights one has come to expect and look forward to in a hockey game. The storyline is predictable but enjoyable, the pounding, energetic `80's soundtrack is excellent and the cast likeable. Not a bad way to while away an evening with a couple of buddies or a girlfriend.My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-."
4,These guys are smarter than the average band,I saw these guys play when they came to my high school. It was really cool and they really rocked. Check out 24/7 and some of the cooler remixes. See these guys live to really get a treat....like a beastie boys cover. :)
2,Typical rap-metal,"I must say this band puts on one hell of a live show, but the music just doesn't translate well on a recording. It's one thing to jump mosh to a live show, but when you hear the CD and reflect on the lyrics you realize that there is little substance to a cover of ICP's ""Chicken Hunting"" or ""Ya wanna be a playa"". I guess Back Rider is better than Limp Bizkit, but who isn't? This band is awesome live but you aren't missing much without the CD. If your into the testrone driven boy rock that is rap-metal this isn't too bad."
2,Entry-level book on PMO,"The authors are good at presenting material in an easy-to-understand format. The book touches on various topics including the assessment of project health, the functions the different actors of project management play in the organization and PMO maturity.However, it is not detailed enough to allow the reader to implement anything.A little expensive for the value."
1,Haydn Gets Soaked,Mother Nature (who receives top billing) continually rains upon some classic Haydn performances by the London Symphony Orchestra. The result is the musical equivalent of vandalism. Caveat emptor!
3,semi-cool,"This toy is kind of cool. see the only thing i don't like about him is the fact that his knee is bent or streched or something?So i got 2 more a [local store] and they were the same thing?? I don't know if he is like that or if he is broken i just don't know. You can move his head,hands,feet,kneen's,arms,legs,and his stomach. You can also take off his wings and put them on his arms."
3,Good balls!,"These balls are ok, they are not consistent, some are hard, some are soft; however they are durable. My 2 year old loves these. We got him an inflatable pool and filled it up. The only thing is you have to pick them up EVERYWHERE!"
3,"Just ""Okay""... but not worth the $$$","Bought this pump to run threee 16"" bubble walls in my 90 gallon freshwater aquarium. My old pump barely produced any bubbles. After initially installing the Aqueon Coralife Super Luft Air Pump, I thought my tank was going to explode there were so many bubbles...this lasted for about two days. After that, I was back to normal and it is barely producing any bubbles...It is decently quiet and probably suitable for normal applications, but not nearly worth the money for deep water or high capicity needs."
2,Not what expected,"Received promptly, but appears it was returned by someone else since part of bottle was missing. I followed the directions 'exactly'...my new sheepskin rug Did Not whiten. It was already pretty clean.Definitely would not recommend."
5,Amazing results,"I was about to discard my sheepskin rug it looked so bad... dog accidents and five years worth of wear. I came across Kookaburra when googling and decided it was worth the try to save the rug. I took it to the local laudromat and used just 3 ounces in a large washer. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the results. It looked as good as new, maybe even better!I had almost the whole bottle left so tried it on some wool area rugs. They came out as clean as could be except two that were not well made ended up with the lining torn from the machine. The well-made one looks beautiful.I will now try cleaning some delicate wools on a very gentle cycle and save a bundle on cleaning."
5,A brilliant legal point of view our country should consider.,"New York State Supreme Court Justice and author Bruce Wright covers controversal issues,and how those issues add into the equation of why the legal system is unfair to blacks."
3,Early Jane Seymour,"I bought this movie only because Jane Seymour is in it, not because I like James Bond movies. It's one of Jane's earlier efforts and does not give justice to her superior acting abilities."
4,"A humorous, intriguing take on 007","Although it's understandable why some dislike this film, it's nowhere near the trainwrecks of A View to a Kill or The World is Not Enough. Not exactly my favorite of the series, it's still one I enjoy watching from time to time.Live and Let Die is a Bond that tends to grows on some people, not all."
3,"A little silly, but one of the best theme songs","Live And Let Die is not a superb Bond adventure, but it still packs a wallop of fights, boat chases, car chases, and an inflated bad guy. Moore is indeed worthy to carry on the Bond name after the superior Connery. He can be tough and self- conscious at the same time. Sheriff Pepper is hilarious ( even more in Man With The Golden Gun ). Yaphet Kotto, one of my favorites, makes a fine villian. The way he dies has to be the ultimate end for a Bond villian. Jane Seymour is indeed hot, but her character is weak. The theme song is incredible, and sets the stage for a wild ride. Overall, it's really just formula Bond, but who cares? As stupid as it can be sometimes, it looks like Gone With The Wind compared to Tomorrow Never Dies."
2,The worst Bond film,"While the franchise as a whole has a place in cultural history, this particular Bond movie is pretty dreadful. It focuses on the worst aspects of these films (paranoia, weird sexiness) and the result is unpleasant at best. We only 'bought' this movie because you can't rent it-- don't make the same mistake! About the only thing it has going for it is good-looking actors."
3,A largely unsatisfactory Bond explained,"If, like me, you were always kind of baffled how Roger Moore managaed to retain the role of James Bond after such a dismal first picture, this Special Edition DVD will likely go a long way towards enlightenment. The number of additional features is impressive, and you will likely need them all to untangle the, let's face it, racist mess that is _Live and Let Die_. It tells you where the producers were trying to go with all the African-American stereotyping and gives you a better appreciation for the time in which the film was shot. Also, there's much discussion given to the Louisiana boat chase sequence, which still, I believe, holds the Guinness Record for the longest boat jump."
3,"Little out there Bond outting, Moore not quite in character","This was Moore's first outting as Bond, and while he wasn't bad, it would take a while for him to completely get into it. Voo doo plot is a little too out there, but Yaphet Kotto actually takes an underwritten character and turns it into one of the better Bond villains to grace the screen. Evil and fun! He was always an under rated actor, unfortunately. But he shows his stuff here."
2,I Prefer Moore,"I prefer Moore instead of Connery in Bond's role. H~e's much more like Fleming's character is described in his books. BUt the history is totally changed from the book in this movie. There is not one crocodile in the entire book, and there are a lot of them in this movie!"
3,007 in Live and Let Die?,"What a bad way for Roger Moore to start as James Bond (007). This movie has it's good sence but still fails to give that James Bond impresion that other James Bond movies do. The first two sence start really confusing and stupid. Then the movie starts to climb back but fails again.Due to its great special effects, Live and Let Die gets three stars but if I were you, I suggest that you record it on a VHS because its not worth buying it on DVD, specialy the big price tag it carries.Also for the big price tag, it's a rip off that the movie wasn't made in Dolby Digital 5.1, instead it was record in the horrible two channel audio which sounds horrible in a Dobly Digital 5.1 receiver.When you watch the movie it feels like your in a cave."
5,Excellent,"A tour de force by Roger Moore, in my opinion his 2nd best performance (after The Spy Who Loved Me) and 3rd best movie (after The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only). The plot isn't great, but it has excellent villains, girl, henchmen, and locations. The absolute low point of the film is its racism."
4,My favorite 007 movie,"Well, some people may say this is not thre best Bond movie ever, and they might be right. But for me personally it is my favorite. One reason is the title song by Paul McCartney. Another reason is Jane Seymour. For Jane's fans it is just a MUST."
2,Piece of junk....,"The only good thing about this shlocky (sp?), horrific, racist piece of (...)is the theme song by a certain former Beatle... poor Paul. Why couldn't you have done a good one?"
5,"""Live & Let Die""-Blu-Ray Edition","I liked the lush strong colors,very clean sharp details,of the video image,and the 5.1Master Audio surround sound,the bonus features/extras were all good,but why no longer cut of the film itself?!And why no deleted scenes,gag reel,more test scenes?!At least for Blu-Ray High Definition,it sure would have been a plus.The animated menu serves it's purpose,over all,still worth it for Bond fans,I recommend it."
2,The weakest Bond!,"Moore was excellent, considering the uneven script and weak supporting cast (excluding the ongoing British cast of characters,i.e.,Moneypenny,etc.). The sets and special effects were definitely ""cheap"" and ""low tech"". I was reminded of a cross between 70's blaxploitation movies,THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, and 60's TV spy shows! Lets not forget George Martin's generic and mundane music score either! The movie is for the ""diehardest"" of Bond fans, such as myself!"
2,I would like to give it 2,"This fil'm fits in somewhere in the middle of my Bond-rating.Sadly,I must say that this is the worst of Moore`s Bonds.It`s not a bad film(the only bad Bond-film is LTK),with Holder and Kotto giving impressive performances in their roles.Moore is good,but he would not grow into the role until the next film.Most of the cast do their job well,and Pepper is good in this film,however not in the next.I especially welcome the all to small appearances of Whisper,wonderfully portrayed by Earl Jolly Brown."
4,I'll second that...,"I want to second the review below. This is a really nice drum book. I would guess it does not get the attention it deserves because it does not have a ""big name"" associated with it nor is it a rudimental study book. Nonetheless, you would not be disappointed to own it. It is interesting and challenging and will certainly aid in your becoming a much better drummer thru reudimental expansion around your kit."
2,Not a hit for this family,My two boys didn't find this board game very interesting at all. The game itself is cheaply made. I find the cherries all over the house as they are so small and easy to misplace. My kids prefer chutes and ladders 10x over this one.
2,"cheap construction, not for intense use / volume","i bought this because it is foldable, and more easily stowed than my peltor h9a ear muffs ($14), which do not fold.even though this milwaukee ear muff is rated at 28 db noise reduction, it lets in a lot more sound than the lower rated peltor ear muffs (25db).and even though this ear muff is called ""heavy duty"", it is anything but heavy duty. it is weak sauce, cheap plastic, poorly molded, made in mexico.so if you only need this for light use and light volume, it's ok for the price. otherwise, don't waste your money on this and go for the peltor ear muffs."
5,Good value ear muffs,"We own two of these and are very happy with them. We use them regularly to mow our 3.5 acres. They are comfortable, attenuate noise well, and have held up nicely for over two years now. It's the only hearing protector my wife will use."
4,Clear and hopeful eye-opener,"Barna's book Revolution is a clear and hopeful eye-opener. Barna presents facts and stats and uses them to interpret trends in culture and specifically in the church. He raises the awareness of a lacking within what he calls the ""local church"" and yet leaves us with great hope in emerging communities of faith. The book is challenging and hopeful. It is written in evangelical speak and articulates the principles of emerging faith communities well."
4,Good Read,This book gave me the information I was looking for in a straight forward and clear manner.
3,not bad,"It's hard to find good ""Ghost"" material out there. This was most likely some kind of pay-per-view special in England, but the band sounds pretty tight. I was never too crazy about the horn section on this tour, but it's certainly interesting."
4,Cool toy!,"This thing is one of the COOLEST toys out there! It has a motion sensor to find you, then it shoots out a little round foam disc for you to hit! (kinda like a baseball pitching machine) And at the price you cant go wrong!"
2,"Sorry to disagree, but this is the worst of Micheal","I am a big fan and have several albums and CD's. This is without a doubt the worst (which still does not make it bad). The sound is too mellow and listless for me and my companion. For new listeners, try 'The Art of Tea', 'Dragonfly Summer' or 'Blue Pacific' for Micheal at his best."
2,"Not exactly ""just the SDK"" but still not great","I bought this book several months ago but I've held off writing a review as I have been trying to learn DirectShow.It is not exactly just the SDK documentation in a paper binding but it isn't a whole lot more either. Most people trying to how to use DirectShow will probably buy this book anyway and they probably should: it is at least better than nothing. But don't get your hopes up.My biggest gripe is that at least one of the examples in this book which does not come directly from the SDK sample programs doesn't seem to actually work. It compiles, and it runs, but it just doesn't display anything."
4,Saved my garage,"I had a tree next to my garage I have been worried about. A local tree service said it was strong, but after buying the book, I recognized many signs (fungus, cracks, two tops) of a hazardous tree. After cutting down, I saw how rotton the inside was, just like the pictures in the book. Without this book, there is no telling how much damage it could have done to my garage."
1,The author is BIASED.,"I am a GENTILE and I wanted to learn all about REFORM JUDAISM, and the author devoted less than ONE PAGE to the subject. So the book should have been called, CONSERVATIVE JUDAISM FOR DUMMIES. It's a waste of money unless you are keenly interested in only one sect of Judaism."
3,"Playable, but in bad shape","My parents bought me this bugle for Christmas because I had just become my Scout Troop's bugler. It's not shiny like the picture is. I tries to kind of wash it and it didn't come off. I also notices on the inside there's like this white paste. I have no idea what that is. Its playable but instead of playing like a trumpet open valves(c,g,c) this one plays c,a,c. I think that's because it's a calvary bugle. Oh I also forgot to mention,it had dents ALL over it when I got it. Over all it works,but it is a bit strange and in bad shape. Oh and I guess it is possible that the bugle I got wasn't this one but I'm pretty sure is it."
3,The Scalp Hunters,"While this is lightly amusing as an early example of a ""Buddy Film"" it seems somewhat confused between a comedy and a serious drama/action film. It is worth a watch but follow up viewings are unlikely."
4,Brain Cap,Group of boys wore these caps during class presentation over the Nervous System. Wish the cap had the sections of the brain labeled on cap.
3,"Not a ""gel"" pad","This pad is a foam rubber product with a fairly grippy surface. It may be exactly what you're looking for if you find the ""gel"" type pads too sticky. Don't expect it to hold your phone at a steep angle on your dash, though."
1,Didn't even last overnight,I bought 5 of these and now I'm returning them for a refund. Put 1 in my car overnight and the next day all 4 sides are curling up about an inch.
4,Neat pad,"I ordered this pad to keep my laptop from sliding on my cooling system I place it on. It works incredibly well. Better than I would have expected. Although I am not using this product for the intended use, it keeps my laptop from sliding on my inclined cooler. If it can do that, it should hold your mobile device. You can tell just by feeling the product that it will hold your device."
5,perfect!,"I bought this for my boss to replace a smaller one that was on its last leg & he loves it! Enough room for radar detector and cell phone, plus. If he's happy, I'm happy! Quick delivery, too, though the mailman folded it in half to make it fit... but no damage to the pad, it didn't seem to mind."
5,Wonderful source for special teas,This is our source for a lovely tea which we can't find in local stores. We plan to order more when our supply runs out.
5,A completely over the top ensemble acting piece.,"If you would like to see what some of your favorite stars were capable of before they got spoiled this is the movie for you. David Caruso, Christopher Walken, Larry Fishburn, Steve Buscemi and Wesley Snipes deliver it all in this action packed thriller. Walken plays Frank White, a career criminal with a conscience who has just gotten out of jail and puts the old gang back together in order to save an inner city hospital from being closed down. His gang includes an incredibly fresh Fishburn and a suitably smarmy Buscemi. The good, (or not-so-good,) cops trying to bring them down are Caruso and Snipes. If you've got a couple of hours to kill and don't mind a few buckets of blood, drug use, profanity, nudity, glorification of violence and racial epithets this one's for you."
4,Classic,In my humble opinion this is easily one of the best movies of all time in his genre. Hands down.
3,A worthy film though not really up on the classic scale.,"Okay, the only reason why I really bought this movie is cause it said on the front of the box: ""WHERE 'SCARFACE'LEFT OFF...'KING OF NEW YORK' BEGINS..."" This made me say, ""Oh, my God! I gotta get this!"" (I said that because Scarface is my favorite movie). When I watched this movie, it was off to a great start! 5 minutes into the movie there was a big shootout and the movie seemed to have had a great score to it! But then, as it got deeper into the movie, I began to notice that this movie really isn't going anywhere. It's plot is indefinable since it doesn't really have one. And they didn't play the score anymore! Overall, it was a good shoot-em-up and had great performances by Christopher Walken and Larry Fishburne. But I wouldn't rank it up with the classic gangster flicks like GoodFellas, Scarface, The Godfather Trilogy and so on. If I were you, I would still buy it!"
4,Blu-Ray? So So,"The movie is great. I had a DVD, watched in the theater a long time ago so no doubt about it.Now the Blu-ray. I don't know why the other guy said it's a razor sharp.The transfer is so so. Most of the shots are slightly better than the DVD.The sound is too small so have to boost up all the way. Gun fight sound is flat.Well, I wouldn't say I regret changing into Blu-Ray, but couldn't say it's one of the best Blu-ray."
2,Overpriced,"I had to purchase this book for an economics course. It does have some good examples and applications, but other times the book just bogs down and is impossible to read. Lastly, the price tag is ridiculious... Teachers, don't make your students waste their money on this."
1,Terrible,"This is my first amazon review, for this terrible book. It is illogical and unclear, making you even more confused after reading. Never ever try it. it will ruin your academic future on economics."
4,Great for me!,"Having used way more expensive products and not having the medical results from them, I tried progreens and the last three years my results have shown great results. Buy this product, especially if you have digestive problems."
5,A good package!,"Please click on ""see all my reviews"", I reviewed this in the 1078BG package. I have both the silver and the black package. mgso"
5,"Order went smooth, drive worked great","This was a replacement for an identical drive that had died after over five years of being in service. The order and delivery went smoothly, and the drive is now in service and performing fine."
3,"Good Acting, but stupid plot.","Being a James Bond fan, I couldn't favor this one really. Even though Roger Moore deos excellent, the plot is so non-existant, and Octopussy is ugly."
4,"One problem, Moore has been Bond too long.","Maud Adams is excellent, despite the fact she was in the Man With The Golden Gun, and dies in it. Louis Jourdan plays Kamal Khan as if Khan is the devil. Kabir Bedi does good as Gobinda,Khan's Oddjob-like goon.Orlov is given little time to form a stage presence."
3,Can't believe I used to think the Moore movies were great...,"I guess it was just the timing, I was pretty much into going to movies about the time Moore was Bond, so I thought they were good then. Seem quite silly these days, though. Which is too bad, since the Connery stuff seems classic."
3,Review of the DVD soundtrack,"A great film, but where is the 5.1 soundtrack ????The three films prior to ""Octopussy"" in this collection (""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""Moonraker"", and ""For Your Eyes Only"") all have 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound, and all the subsequent films are presented in this format (5.1), so what happened to ""Octopussy"" ???""Octopussy"" is presented in Stereo Surround, and as this is one of my favorite bond films, I always feel a bit disappointed every time I watch the film.In fact 8 of the first 9 DVD Bond film titles are presented in mono from ""Dr. No"" to ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" (apart from ""Thunderball"" in 5.1).""Octopussy"" is a great film, but DVD enthusiasts should be beware that the sound is only in stereo."
1,Don't waste your money on something no one in business reads,"This magazine is a joke -- it's Booz-Allen's attempt to build something similar to the McKinsey Quarterly. But the articles are usually vapid and completely lacking of insight, and among CEOs and CFOs of large corporations very few will even have heard of this thing. (The Quarterly, on the other hand, along with HBR, is the BIBLE of management thinking.) The editors of this rag even show up on CNBC all the time, and make generally simplistic and completely useless commentary -- that should tell you something. Don't waste your money -- spend a little more and get HBR, or buy online access to MQ."
2,Left-biased,"This is the second book by Preston that I read, and I felt dissapointed when I discovered that it was extremely left-biased. Minimizes the relevance of the raising of 1934, praises the behaviour of Largo Caballero and blames the CEDA for everything. He denies the existence of violence during the 2nd Republic and minimizes the responsibility of organizations linked with the PSOE with the violence. Of course the war was the responsiblity of the pro-fascist who delivered the coup and completed the raising, but pretending that the 2nd Republic was a modern democracy is simply out of the historical reality. Better to look for the responsibility of everyone in this war, where no good parties existed, only bad ones."
4,"Fast and easy, what's the fridge makes a pasta dinner","Ok, you are home from work and want dinner in 45 minutes or less; so it's spaghetti or pasta, of course. But if you don't want to open yet another jar of tomato sauce, you can grab this cookbook instead. That's what I do. I look in the fridge and take inventory of the vegetables, and then open the book and see what I can make. We end up eating a lot more healthy veggies and low-fat sauces because we use this book. I got it as a gift and I have to say, it's just about the most-used book in the kitchen.It happens to make a very nice present in a basket with some boxes of fancy pasta, a few decorative vegetables and a couple of nice, woven towels in an Italian theme. And a bottle of red wine, too."
5,A Truly Masterful Tale,"Stunningly well written, Richter does an amazing job of capturing the early American atmosphere in this third book of his Awakening Land trilogy. While the entire book is told from the third person, one thing I really liked was the way he tells different chapters from the perspective of different characters. The way the characters are built, especially Sayward is truly amazing as we get to see their actions from several different perspectives. Make sure to read the review by ""A reader from Yokota air base, Japan."""
3,Your parents help put it together...,"I just finished a game with my 3 year old nephew. I had to put it together and take it apart. When he wanted to play again, all the stand-up cardboard peices never made it back in. This is not a game that a child could set up. You move about the board by drawing cards. The cards have colors on them to indicate where you need to move your character. All of the colors are off-color. The ""Yellow"" is more of an off yellow, the orange is not a true orange. It is quite confusing if you're trying to teach colors to a child."
5,My Grand-Baby & I!,Home run! This is a winner by all means. It captures my relationsip w/my grand-daughter.
5,Great for hot weather,"I have sensitive eyes and skin and I live in temperatures over 90 degrees most of the year. This product has served me well for the last year. No irritation, is easily absorbed and doesn't irritate my eyes or skin. This line of skin care is really wonderful."
3,Ending saves this awkward film,"Mainstream critics have virtually ignored this subdued little gothic, but cable TV has exhumed it from obscurity.While Roeg does have a flair for color and setting (Venice provided the best possible backdrop), the other logistics are awkward and umpolished. Movement and interaction is clumsy and unnatural. Poor sound quality muffles out much of the key dialogue. The music is misguided and incongruous with the scenes.Despite these weaknesses and the general sluggish pace, the film effectively culminates in one of the most chilling movie scenes of all time."
4,Very Realistic and Haunting,This very realistic film puts the viewer on the edge. It is very realistic from the point of view that after a while the viewer starts to interpret images and events from recent day to day happenings. Did you really see what you thought you saw or did I imagine it? The film slides into this world where all control you thought you had may never really have existed. This is a slow and deliberate work but questions the state of our own being. Very haunting.
3,Psychic Melodrama!,"John (Donald Sutherland) and Laura Baxter (Julie Christie) have recently lost their daughter during some mysterious circumstances, and similar circumstances seem to repeat themselves in Venice where the Baxter's reside after the loss of their daughter. The circumstances are closely tied with a couple of older ladies, including one who is declared to be psychic. The psychic lady can see their lost daughter, however, she also senses a dark looming future drawing near. The rhetorical question is what is it that she sees, and who else sees it? Don't Look Now is an intriguing film that uses images as evidence for future events, however, the whole experience seems slow, tiresome, and repetitive."
2,"Odd, interesting and flamboyant, but taxing on the patience.","""Don't Look Now"" is a very interesting, odd, and flamboyant film. However, it is also taxing on one's patience as the movie drags on and on for what seems like hours. Roeg does a great job providing suspense to the audience, but the movie is so reliant on the shocking ending to the extent that the movie as a whole is overshadowed by the ending. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie give brilliant performances in this unique movie which seems Argento-like but actually makes sense as the movie closes. As far as the elements of horror are concerned, there is no denying the influence of the genre but to classify ""Don't Look Now"" exclusively as horror would be a grave misjustice not only to the movie itself but also to the horror genre. In short, if you are looking for a good scary flick, it's best not to look here...period."
1,Very Slow with One Exception,"This is a very slow movie with a somewhat confusing presentation. But, Julie and Donald spice it up for a few minutes with a really hot bedroom scene."
5,"Posted Editorial Review is for ""Puffball""","Probably doesn't really matter, but the plot synopsis that accompanies this Amazon listing is for Roeg's 2007 film ""Puffball"" and not the 1973 film ""Don't Look Now."" Both films are directed by Nicolas Roeg and both films feature Donald Sutherland, but aside from a psychic theme, that's all they have in common.""Don't Look Now"" is a psychic thriller about a couple (Julie Christie & Sutherland) staying in Venice, Italy where he is restoring the art in an old church. Grieving the child they recently lost in a drowning accident, they encounter two strange sisters; one of whom professes to be psychic and in touch with their dead daughter who she claims is trying to warn them of impending danger. Pretty exciting stuff and the superior of the confused Roeg films."
5,"Roeg's finest work, by me","This is a fascinating film from a filmmaker who, in recent years, seems sadly responsible for his lack of reknown; Roeg hasn't made a movie this rich or ambitious in a long, long time. Based on a Daphne DuMaurier story, this tale of the supernatural, set in Venice, is extremely intelligent, and opens doors for much analysis of how and why thoughts of the supernatural obsess people as they do. Roeg's interest in self-reflexivity in cinema, more fully realized in BAD TIMING, is invoked here as well; Sutherland and Christie give excellent performances; and, lowbrow as it seems to say this, the sex scene between them is one of the most interesting and intense in the history of mainstream cinema. It's a great, flawless thriller -- though if you think you might be a moron, you'd probably best stay away from it; it's no slasher movie. Oh, yeah -- Venice is lovely, too."
2,"An okay book, but not great.","My son does love this book, but as far as its purpose goes, it falls far short of expectations. There is almost no focus on the purpose of a potty at all. I had hoped that the photographs would be helpful, but they are very cute, posed, and lack the body parts involved in the actual process of using the toilet. There is only one page that even mentions the prohibited bodily functions. I don't enjoy the choice of wording, and it feels like a cheap attempt by a publishing company to get a book out of as few pictures and words as possible. Inexpensive to make, yes, but helpful to toilet-training parents? An emphatic no."
3,"It's a success, but why?","This book is a favorite of my 20 month old son's because of the pictures as well as the manner in which I read it, emphasizing how silly it is to use the potty as a toy box, hat, etc. However, it is unclear to me whether he is actually getting the point of the book, or if he just likes the pictures and the way I read it. I think most potty books for boys will fall short to a degree because none are daring enough to show anatomy or discuss the standing vs. sitting issues. However, having a few of these books around can only help and certainly can't hurt. I will say that in comparison to our other potty book which has more detail regarding the process as well as cute drawings, it does not hold my son's attention the way this one does."
4,A good first book,"If you want to start talking about potty training with your son, this is a good first book. It shows a few boys in diapers looking at a potty and trying to figure out what it is. Then it gives a basic overview of what to do when you go potty. The numerous images of boys may help your son see this is a normal thing all boys do.If you've already started using the potty or your child knows what a potty seat is, this book will not be very useful to you."
5,fantastic customer service!,Delivered promptly and in great condition! Husband loves the authenticity and feel. Thanks for a great shopping experience! Will definitely visit the store again!
3,review book,"Fast service, but book was not in as good of shape as advertized, it was in 'good' shape, not 'great'."
2,Too dated,"It may have been a good book in its day, but is far too dated for a modern reader. There are many far more up-to-date type books about the war in the Pacific. The ""Diary"" is just that and gives too little detail about the actual battles or men who fought them. He states that there was a ""bombing"" or ""strafing"" by the Japs, but he gives no further detail. If you want an actual, detailed, first-person account of the many battles in the south Pacific, try ""With the Old Breed"" or ""Into the Rising Sun"". Both are excellent accounts of battles in the south Pacific during WWII."
5,"This book teaches true health, which is true freedom.","In the last few centuries, no one has come close to a more safe and effective method of healing than Dr. Ehret. For centuries, man has abused his stomach, and therefore, has cut short his life span and quality of life. Dr. Ehret has revealed the truths that convey the idea: ""you are what you really eat."" This is a must have for every American, athlete, elder, chronically sick, and young healthy person in the world today. Discover what the dangers or our modern diets are and how they show themselves in our everyday lives by gray hair, cancer, cavities, and obesity."
5,"For Truth Seekers: On the body, food, obstruction, vitality","Reading this book I feel like a archeologist having just discovered in some anchient tomb, a manuscript containing the greatest secrets to life! Prof. Ehret uncovers in simple language the most fundamental aspects about the nature of the body, accumulation of obstructions, mucous and toxins and the resulting disease, by what ever name they may be called. Also how to go about cleansing the body while transitioning to a pure, natural diet that is meant for our bodies. The book appeals to our common sense and rings clear as an obvious but completely overlooked truth."
5,Used book review,Book was in excellent condition and received well before it was anticipated. This is an excellent resource for clients as well as for information regarding any family members or friends who have struggled with this issues. Very well written and easy to read.
4,"Not bad, but not Lawhead's best","The only other Lawhead book I had read prior to this one was ""Byzantium"". Needless to say, ""The Iron Lance"" is inferior to ""Byzantium"".This isn't to say that the book is not without its strengths. The protaganist is a fairly well developed character for whom it is easy for the reader to empathize. Lawhead is at his best in the action scenes. He paints vividly with his writing as he describes the horrors of the Crusades.I will recommend this book, but if you haven't read anything by Stephen Lawhead then you should read ""Byzantium"". Its is best work yet."
3,A good fictional story depicting life during the crusades.,"I just finished reading ""The Iron Lance"". It provided a good story; however, it did not just knock my socks off. The book began somewhat slow, but this was necessary to set up the main character Murdo's strengths and weaknesses. I decided to continue on because I had read good things about Mr. Lawhead's writing. I am glad I did.I don't necessarily read the books for historical accuracy, but rather the ability of the book to transport me to another time. I have read other novels that did this with excellence. ""The Iron Lance"" may not have attained this level of excellence, but I felt the book was a good read.I would recommend this to anyone who reads historical fiction books for entertainment. For the die hard, avid historical fiction fan, this may not be the case.The book was good enough, that I will read the next book in the trilogy when I come across it. I rated it a 3 star, but it was more like a 3.5 star."
4,Great book!,"This is a great christian fiction book based on fact. All the places, people and events are researched right but have been twisted into a story of a young boy called Murdo who goes looking for his two brothers and farther in the Crusade. This book tells the truth about the first crusade and the horrid things that happend to the poor pilgrims on the way to the Holy City and the horrid, horrid events that happend when they got there. A slap on the back to Stephen for now fluffing that part and telling how it was. I enjoyed the boys romp around the holy land and have just started on the 2nd book. If i could, i'd give the book 4 and 1/2 stars, 1/2 missing because he really didnt develop Murdo very well untill the end when he had grown up. One last thing, I love the way the plot twists back and forward from past to present! I can't wait to find out what it's all about."
4,Very good steamer and perfect size for two people,"I was looking at a lot of other steamers prior to buying this one and I was a little concerned about how big the 'compact' version is. I can honestly say that if there's usually only two people eating then this has enough room to steam a full meal for both. If you are steaming for a full family then you probably won't have enough for all your fish, vegetables etc.The only slight gripe I have with the product is that it can be a little hard to clean the seperating plates if something sticks as the steam holes are a little small to easily clean off food remains after steaming. I've only noticed this with fish so far and overall I still love this steamer"
4,Promised Land,Wish I had started reading the Spenser books sooner rather than later. It was hard for me to put down!
4,Its a good book..,"Its a good book.... have many tactics that were helpfull to my team, I trying to apply all I have learned in the game."
5,A WORTHY GERMAN GEM,"This is one solid item that anyone who has interest in German language should have around. Its authority is unquestionable.With ""Collins German Unabridged Dictionary"", learners are assured of the most comprehensive explanation of both terms and phrases.This updated edition is simply unbeatable. It provides access to thousands of idioms, as well as technical and professional terms. It is a lexicon that assists inexperienced users in the conjugation of many irregular verbs that makes German a brain-toasting tongue."
5,Indispensable,"I have nightmares about my life before this dictionary. To describe it as thorough is an understatement. Every level user, from beginner to advanced in either language will find this dictionary well-organized and easy to use. It includes sections on irregular verbs, rechtsschreibreform, letter-writing etiquette, and business etiquette. I don't think that I could appreciate this dictionary so much if I hadn't experienced so many others. In my opinion, this version beats Langenscheit hands down. I am, however, a native English speaker; it is possible that a native German speaker would disagree on this point.In all, for users of any level, this dictionary is a necessity for successful and accurate use of either language."
5,Argh argh argh,arrived on time and was packaged in a box. No damage and it was sealed so it was obviously new.This show is awesome and i will enjoy this for a long timeI am going to find other seasons to buy and hopefully this seller has them.
2,Very Disappointing to a Mailer Fan,"I've read most of his books and thoroughly enjoyed them, but not this one. Mailer's arrogance is apparent here. A self-indulgent, flabby work. Only read it if you insist on reading everything he's ever written."
3,Very soft when new,These towels were really soft when they arrived. After one wash thought they don't seem to maintian that softness. Still a good buy considering the price
2,MORE OF THE SAME,"THE POLICE ACADEMY GETS MORE CADETS AND THEY ALL WORK ON BRINGING DOWN CRIMINALS. THIS WAS THE LAST SEQUEL THAT STEVE GUTTENBERG WOULD RETURN FOR. VERY BORING AT TIMES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, STILL MUCH BETTER THAN THE SEQUELS THAT WOULD FOLLOW. THE HIGHLIGHT HERE IS A YOUNG DAVID SPADE."
4,Intriguing brain-candy with a twist.,"I have kept this book for many years, and every time I read it, I still get drawn in inspite of its simplistic approach. I understand that there are 4 books in the series. Anyone know the title of the 4th book? I look forward to being drawn in time, after time, after time, after..."
5,Fibromyalcia,"Great help during my support group for Fibromyalcia. I learned some of my symptoms and why. Not that there are any cures. However, some suggestions.Thank you,Cindy Connor"
4,formulaic... predictable.... but still good,"I saw this movie at a college theatre so the admission was free and since I had spare time to burn, I went in. Maybe I'm too cynical, but the plot mirrors that of The Butterfly Collector, except it is a psychotic woman doing the abducting instead of a psychotic man, and the abductee is a James Caan instead of a college girl. Read Butterfly Collector and you'll realize that Stephen King basically ripped it off, changed a few details, and gave it a happy ending. However, the film does do a good job at suspense so its not too bad. I gave it a 4 because it's not a bad film, but just saying..."
4,A little to obsessed,"Misery is a powerful film but don't think would call it a horror movie. Very intense, suspenseful film that has quite a good story to it. Maybe people can relate to it on how a die hard fan of a celebrity or someone famous takes there obsession a little to far. It does remind me some of 'the fan' but much more of an edge of your seat atmosphere. The movie is played often on the basic cable channels still being it is over 20 years old. If you have not seen it and like very suspense type movies, give it a try.Peter J. Miller"
5,Misery,"A movie with both a plot, directing, definitive surprise. Makes you cringe when the ""hammer"" comes out. Well acted and suspensful, with two great actors. A very good thriller by King."
5,Great movie to watch over and over again!,"I loved this movie! It's a great thriller!Paul Sheldon, an author of a bestselling series, has decided to stop his series by killing off his main charactor. In his car one snowy night he has a car crash and is stranded. Luckily (or not so luckily) a lady finds him and brings him back to her house. The lady nurses him back to health and puts a cast on his broken leg. It turns out that the lady who found him is a crazy fan of his books and after reading his last book, and finding out that the main charactor dies, isn't so friendly (to put it mildly)."
5,I love this movie...very good!!!!,This movie is so incredible!! A great thriller!! This is definately Kathy Bates' best movie EVER!! James Caan is excellent in it as well. Must have movie!!
5,Forgotten thriller,"timeless classic , a must see must have DVD for the collection of any who enjoy a great thriller now and then"
4,Excellent Movie,"This movie is excellent no complaints what so ever. the acting is great, the scene is great the plot is great. this movie is suspensful and realistically frightening. Just a wonnderfully made movie worth the buy. The ankle scene is just sick. Buy it you wont regret it."
4,great Kathy Bates,"Una gran imagen y sonido para una gran película. No hay muchos artificios en la misma y no se aprecia DNR aparentemente. Lleva incluído el castellano en la película y en la película incluída en el dvd que se adjunta, aunque este último sea Zona A exclusivamente y los extras no están subtitulados (esto me parece muy mal por parte de la distribuidora Warner).Kathy Bates está inconmensurable, fantástica e irrepetible (por Dios, que nunca se le ocurra a ningún descerebrado hacer un remake de esta obra de arte...).En resumen, compra obligada porque será aprovechar muy bien su dinero. El envío de amazon, aunque lento, bien protegido."
5,I give this movie a two thumbs up !,This movie is the best movie in the world and i think it should be played more often on T.V. it's really greate you should watch sometime!!!!
4,Good Selection,"This product was given as a gift to a friend who start listening to Country Music. He was personally satisfied and other people who listen at first time also enjoy it.There are few worldwide recognizable music which could make it easier to get used at first time, so it is a good selection based on the title."
5,Works great for our smaller pond,I live in Michigan and this works great for our smaller pond (5ft long x 3 ft wide x 3ft deep) so that the ice doesn't freeze and our goldfish don't die in the winter. Item came as described and you can't beat the price. Haven't had it for very long yet (only a couple months) so not sure how durable it is.
2,Worked a couple of months,It was discouraging that this stopped working as we could not tell until the ice formed and the DeIcer was sitting on top. In view of the good reviews I am going to try another one and hope that the good reviews will prevail.
1,do not waste your money,"IBought this a few weeks ago to be ready for the cold winter. It does not work, I even tried it in a large bucket of water to see, No, It does not work.I wish I had bought it recently, so ,I can return it.Try it, make sure you can return it."
1,COMPLETE RIP-OFF,"This is a complete waste of money. I bought one, used it for one season, and it froze solid into the ice. I had to spend four hours melting a hole with hot water and salt so I could use my old inefficient but dependable heater. I called the manufacturer who told me to cut off the plug and mail it in. I did, and I was sent a new heater.The next year I used the second heater and the same thing happened during a long cold spell (about three weeks in 20s by day and single numbers at night). This time a little pool of water remained underneath the heater, but the pond froze solid a few inches beeath it. I pulled out the Thermo-Pond and spent hours widening the hole enough to put my old heater back in. I was lucky I noticed the problem, or I might have lost all my koi. I'd never use one of these again."
2,Will try again,"I bought one of these back in Dec. once we got snow storm and a wind, it was trapped under the ice on the pond. Tried to chip out of the ice, I can not see it at all only the cord. Will have to wait until spring now. Will have to buy another one, and hope it stays on top the ice/water"
5,tiny fish pond,"So far, it's worked exactly as I'd hoped it would. Excellent for very small ponds like mine - even a clown could use it, it's so simple."
3,It;s Okay But It's Just Not The Same Without Steve Guttenberg!,I liked the Police Academy movies and I agree with the reviewers who wrote that they though the first four Police Academy movies are the best. This movie was okay and had some amusing scenes but suffered from the loss of Steve Guttenberg as Mahoney.
3,"""Police Academy 5 - Assignment: Miami Beach"" (USA 1988)","Many movie critics say that ""Police Academy 5"" is a TURKEY, but in my opininon, it is a real improvement over the not-knowing-where-it-was-going ""Police Academy 4"". ""- Assignment: Miami Beach"" has some funny (indeed, absolutely ridiculously unbelievable) moments and is probably to many people one of the best of the series. The movies reached their high point with the hilarious ""Police Academy 6"" (1989), but the whole hilarity of the series was destroyed with 1994's embarassing ""Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow"". ""Police Academy 5"" is great... buy it!"
1,Disappointing....,"Nothing new here. Just a mashup of parts of the work of Sitchin. It's written in this typical style: ""if this-and-that happened 10.000 years ago then we might expect this to happen again."". This becomes very annoying after a number of chapters. Besides dubious content, the book is not properly formatted. Sentences and sometimes complete paragraphs are broken off with their remainders spilled into other sentences or paragraphs, making reading the book a challenge... Apparently not much attention has been given to its digital format.If these topics have your interest, there's better material out there. I should have read the preview and saved myself money.... Avoid!!!"
3,"High camp from the thirties, expertly done","More exotic kitsch from the Dietrich-von Sternberg collaborations of the thirties. It's not as good as Shanghai Express but it provides its own pleasures. The operatic plot (shades of Carmen!) features Dietrich as an icy femme fatale who leads her admirers to ruin. Marlene acts as though she's having a lot of fun which is great. With equisite photography by Von Sternberg himself, Edward Everett Horton (non-comic performance) as a frustrated magistrate, Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero as her deliriously entranced victims. Classic line: If you loved me so much, why didn't you die for me? A relic of the thirties that demands tongue in cheek viewing."
3,In the name of friendship....,"I met Stephanie (author) several months ago and had the pleasure of receiving a copy of her book. You have read the negative reviews, which I know were very hurtful to the author. So in the name of friendship and sistahhood, I am writing my review. Stephanie, as I shared with you before, your story line is something you believe in and I know that it would have been better received, had you gotten the book edited professionally. We live and learn and I know you've learned a great lesson in having your 1st book printed. Please don't allow this to discourage you from doing something you have a passion for. Take the criticism constructively and do what you need to do to let ""readers"" know that you care about their feedback. I will support you as I have shared with you before and I am sure many others will as well. Tell your story....and if I can do anything to assist, you......you know how to find me."
5,"a haunting movie, a haunting soundtrack","I was fortunate to be able to see The Pianist back in Sept when I was visiting Poland. The movie and music left me mesmerized. It is truly an amazing story of survival by this man and ultimately the music does help save his life.The soundtrack showcases the work of Fredrick Chopin, probably one of the most famous composers to come out Poland. His melodies are haunting and remain with you long after they are over, very much like the movie."
4,Statistics Made Easy,"I actually enjoyed my statistics class using this book, however the study guide was invaluable and gave me an opportunity to practice, practice, practice (and it had the answers to help). I will miss this course."
2,do not like,The product came with in the time allowed. It really didn't do what I needed it to. I am not happy with it. Nothing against who I bought it from.
2,CK boy shorts,"I love CK underwear because of its softness, but buy this only if you enjoy walking around all day with a mild wedgie."
5,Best X-Mas Album EVER!!!!!,"Simply put my girls 3LW have made the best Christmas album that has ever been recorded, they give you true flavor that everybody in the hood can listen to year round and have a good time opening gifts to, riding in the car to, or just sitting at home vibing to. If you don't have this album then you are truly missing out!!!! 3LW is the best group of all time no matter how many people hate on them, I wish they hadn't broke up but hey...You gotta buy this album A.S.A.P. if you don't have it(I brought 2)!!!"
1,---------------------,could this album cover look anymore trashy? my 7 year old cusin has better singing than these two fools put together.
5,Complete the Platinum Collection,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King are all magical Disney animated films and the best choices for the ultimate in DVD collecting, the PLATINUM EDITION. Only one title was missing from that list, but this October, Aladdin will finally join and complete the Disney Platinum Series. Aladdin is one the best stories ever made into a Disney animated film with memorable characters and songs.Put ""A Whole New World"" into you Disney DVD PLATIUM collection with Aladdin."
1,Amazon review,I haven't yet received this DVD. I had ordered it once before in December for a Christmas gift and didn't get it. So now I ordered it again a month ago from a different seller and still haven't gotten it.I don't have much faith in Amazon any more.
2,It hasn't worked right since we recieved it,"The DVD has skipped since day 1. Had I not thrown away the slip, I would have sent it back. You can't watch the whole movie. If there's a way I can replace it, please let me know."
3,Expensive entertainment,"I searched for a blu ray when looking for this movie - guess they're not available. Should have known since it didn't specify on the details but was keeping my fingers crossed since it said it was a two-disc set and cost $50. In the end, I was wrong. Lesson learned: wait. $50 for a Disney DVD is way too much, especially since I got lion king and beauty and the beast, both blu ray and dvd combos, for a combined total of what I paid for just Aladdin DVDs. It was a requested Xmas present so I thought I was doing a good thing. At the end of the day, I think my money would have been better spent elsewhere."
1,Worst message to children,"I am appalled by all the positive reviews. This movie sends the worst message to children. Please everyone, strip away the visuals and the catchy music and look carefully at the storyline. It is about a poor boy who has big dreams. But rather than trying to work his way up, he resorts to stealing. Apparently the only way one can succeed in life is by finding a magic Genie in a bottle. But worst of them all is the princess. She is a rich spoiled girl who is bored to death, complaining about her life while ignoring the street children eating out of trash cans outside her palace wall. There are never any indication that these two did anything to help anybody else but themselves. Shame on you, Disney!"
